,Recommended,444140,24026177,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,ShinTheKnight,"SoniComi is a videogame featuring Super Sonico. You play as her cameraman in a series of visual novel, quick time, and photography sections. Your actions and choices will guide you to one of multiple endings.SoniComi originally released for PC sometime in 2011. Eventually, the game had a slightly improved re-release came to PS3 in 2014.The game itself is mostly a visual novel, with a couple of scenes for the Photography segments are in 3D. Also, the only character model in 3D is Sonico herself, with a wide assortment of outfit and color options for you to pick from. Obviously, you don't have access to the really good outfits until later in the game.The visual novel sections are pretty standard, with the inclusion of backlogs. One thing you need to know however, is there's no ""Save anywhere"" option, like other visual novels. You are only given save points at the beginning of each chapter, and before the photography segments.The Quick-Time Sections are just slightly different alterations of the visual novel section, where you have the option to interact with Sonico with a pre-selected action, and aim wherever you want. These actions can vary from patting her on the head, Grabbing her arm, Talking about a certain subject, and more. These segments of selection are also timed, so it is possible to not interact.The Photography segments have similar controls to a first-person-shooter. you have free movement around an enclosed area around Sonico at your location, and you must take pictures of her from different angles at specific points. Time them all perfectly to start a combo, and a traditional point scoring system shows your results. The outfits you select for Sonico to wear for these segments will determine your ending.This game does not feature any nudity, so if you're here to be lewd, all you'll have are oppai and panty shots.Performance wise, on my beast of a machine (i7 4790K, 16gb Ram, GTX 1080), this game was a breeze to run. The game supports up to 1080p resolution, and can be played in windowed mode or fullscreen.Ultimately, if you are a fan of virtual japanese idols (including Hatsune Miku), this game is right for you. If you're here for fanservice, it may not be worth the current asking price.I personally enjoyed it."

The main selling points are:- Touching Anime Girls Boobs- Calling Anime Girl Lewd Names- Putting Cat Ears on Anime Girl- Making Anime Girl to perverted poses- Not getting killed by mafia-senpai managerThe game is oversexualized and the gameplay narrows down to lewdness and little to nothing else.So all in all, 8/10, above average for the industry."

,Recommended,444140,26039686,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,senna,"In this game, you become a personal photographer of a beautiful young gravure model, Sonico. And you must remember that the rest of the world sees her through your camera - your photos change her image in eyes of other people. What kind of Sonico will you create? The innocent girl? The sexy goddess? Or may be cute ditz?Essentially a visual novel x dressup x fps, and this works just fine. The story is okayish I guess (well, comparing to professional VNs, not casual ones). You get a lot of clothes for Sonico, and you have to choose not only by it looks, but also by an effect on the audience. Then you get to run around her and click on colored circles to make a shot. Unfortunately, you won't get any real pictures, but still this part is great for a change of pace.Correction. After you finish the game once, the so-called 'free mode' will be available to you, where you could make actual pictures of Sonico. In a free mode, the time is not limited, and you get more control over Sonico: you can ask her to change to specific pose you made available during the game, or change her mood. Photos made during 'free mode' can be saved to your computer as regular png files, and can be used afterwards.Interaction is active-time during VN phases - if you didn't decide what to say in time, it would be considered as silence. During FPS phase the girl is actively moving around, which makes it fun and realistic.Sonico's voiced, other characters are not. I'd say she's slightly miscast, but it does not break the spell. The voice acting is good. Her character is well-written and suits different tastes in fact.It seems there are some deeper story in the game, but I didn't get to it yet, as I am pretty much in the beginning of the game. But the game is pretty much about relations between you and Sonico. There are several endings. Your choice does matter, the girl will remember some words you say, comment on them later on, or change her attitude toward you.The story does not appear to be very long of itself, but it appears you would need NG+ to unlock all endings.The graphics is fine, it is 3d with anime filter and will pretty much remind you about Neptunia. The game could use some line blurring, but that didn't affect my impression.Achievement page is funny: several achievements in fact form a single picture.The girl indeed shows some skin, but there is nothing you wouldn't see on a daytime TV.There are lot of love invested into this game, and the result is amazing. If you are into light-hearted visual novels, or just want to dress up a girl and make her pose for you, you definitely should buy this game. It is perfectly on the mark. I'd rate it S+."

,Recommended,444140,34261117,Posted: 15 August,all,Yureina,"Ehh... it's ok I guess.You play as generic newbie camera man X (you can choose yer name) who ends up becoming the personal photographer for Sonico, who to my understanding is a character found in several other games made by Nitroplus. While there are a number of characters in this game, Sonico herself is pretty much the only one worth mentioning since everyone else can be very rapidly summarized with a few words. At least with describing Sonico, you would probably need at least a sentence or two. I did find her rather likeable, but that's just my opinion. In other words, if you are looking for deep plots and characters, then you should look elsewhere.Gameplay is straight-forward, but effective. You direct the course of Sonico's modeling career, choose the outfits, and snap a ton of pictures. There is a considerable amount of variety and options for the player to choose from, though it will take time to unlock them. It's kind of a mix of a VN, some management elements, and the ""camera"" part of the game which I've heard is similar to some past pokemon game. I don't know anything about that. What I do know is that the gameplay in Sonicomi works well, is reasonably challenging, and player choice can result in a crazy number of possible endings.So, functionally, the game is fine. It's very different from just about anything I've played that I can recall, and I found nothing really serious to complain about that would make me want to throw this game into a fire. That, of course, does not mean I don't have stuff to poke at about this game.The two problems I have with Sonicomi regard its replayability and pricing on Steam. You can finish this game without too much trouble or time investment, but to truly be able to see everything, unlock all of the endings, and be able to use all of the HUGE number of possible clothing choices... prepare to grind yourself silly. I understand that some people are into that, but at the moment... not me. Maybe at some later date.Keeping that in mind, the default asking price for this game is $35. While you could probably get 35 hours of gameplay out of this if you decide to get into grind mode... you won't know if you are up for that if you have no idea how the gameplay in this actually works. So my advice to people who have some interest in this game is to wait for a sale unless you are absolutely sure you will enjoy this game and are perfectly ok with getting grindy.So... if you want to chat with and play dress-up with an endearing anime model/musician, snap a bunch of pictures of her, and potentially grind yourself silly to unlock everything having to do with that stuff, then this game might be for you.Have fun and stuff."

I know most of the people who bought this buy it for da fanservice (myself included), but the captivating character of Sonico made me love this game. The story is pretty sweet too, some routes have a bit of drama, but it's executed nicely.The FPS (photography) aspect of the game is okay, not that challenging and can get kinda boring. But listening and watching Sonico is the best part of photoshoot considering how cute she is. The clothings are pretty fashionable and you can dress Sonico up and take her pictures in free mode, if you're into that.Honestly though, if you like VNs and fluffy, sweet, diabetes-inducing moments, buy this game when it's on sale, you won't regret it.In conclusion, Sonico is without a doubt, one of the best waifu in existence. By the time you completed all the routes and get all the endings, Sonico is surely already in your top 10 list of best girls.P.S.: This game doesn't have any 18+ stuff, but you should probably still play it alone unless you don't wanna see your mother looking at you with dissappointed eyes. But if you're lucky there's a 10% chance that your mother will like Sonico too. ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)"

It's like Pokemon Snap and osu mixed with a visual novel.Instead of taking pictures of Pokemon, you only have Sonico and the multitude of clothes you can dress her with.Your score will depend on how good you are at taking pictures (i.e. align your camera properly at the rings and snap at the right time), and if the clothes match the needs of the client on each level.The routes/endings are quite a lot, and will depend mostly on how you dressed Sonico and the various choices you make during the story segments.In-game music is also quite nice, and hopefully they release the OST at some point.The songs made by First Astronomical Velocity (Sonico's band) are actually available on Spotify though, so I highly recommend listening to them at some point.Overall, would recommend.Hopefully JAST and Nitroplus release more games on Steam in the future."

Hatsune Miku has her Project Diva series, Gumi has Megpoid the Music, IA has IA/VT Colorful, etc. Most of them play pretty similarly, and they're all pretty good, so naturally when it came Super Sonico's turn, they didn't do anything like any of that and made this instead.Sonicomi focuses on the gravure side of Sonico's character almost entirely, rather than the more obvious band focus. The game is mostly a visual novel, with the gameplay segments involving dressing up Sonico both to satisfy the client's needs and the direction you want to take her for one of the 18 endings and then moving around her in the studio taking photos, which amounts to ""shooting"" circles that appear around her. On your first playthrough it's pretty fun, and the soundtrack is upbeat enough to keep it a little exciting, but it doesn't have very much staying power even when it starts introducing new environments. After my second playthrough I ended up just downloading a completed save so that I could skip the photo segments, because ultimately the only thing that changes in subsequent playthroughs is the clothing you dress her in. As a visual novel the game fares better, and while it's not amazing it does a good job of being funny and maybe a little emotional at times. If you're expecting to 100% this game then you should probably just turn around, and I have a hard time recommending it at full price, but ultimately it delivers about what you'd expect from a Sonicomi gravure game.

If you dislike reading skip, the option is there but keep in mind that the story branches and you might skip over stuff you've never read (yeah you have to replay it, it such a game). And yeah tbh, there was quite some awsome stuff in there that I never imagined.The production quality is very high, music is awesome (I can't get enough of the intro/theme), graphics are perfect for what they are trying to convey and voice acting (Sonico) is awesome. I can't rememberr being so gripped by a fictional character since playing Gone Home (which by the way is awesome and you should play it). Anyway, just even being in the same ballpark as that game should mean samething.You should realize this game has a distinct oriental flavor. If you can't grasp that mindset you might skip and play a more western game. That said, the game doesn't hold back on options on how to play it so that's a huge plus. After playing through it for the first time you unlock some cool stuff that gives you a nice selection of options of how to play. Whether you wanna do the story, grind for some coins to get cool stuff and unlock♥♥♥♥♥♥ just take cool screenshots, the game provides and you can take it from there.All in all I was first mesmorized by the bouncing F's but in the end I found something much more valuable and much more weird. A real connection to a fiction character. I really felt bad when Soni didn't get the future she deserved. It's odd and I'm not sure what to make of it but I promise to try harder next time!Note: I generally dislike (and suck at) 3D shooting stuff and such and if you're the same, don't let that put you off.

I was expecting to play a game of Waifu-Pokémon-Snap, but it turns out it's that on top of being a feels-train visual novel with like, 18 different endings. Yes, there's 18 friggin' endings, and in the playthroughs I have done so far the quality of your photographic prowess, your choices, as well as what actions you take all have minute affects on the outcome of your game's ending. Overall, this game absolutely blew me away, and is easily one of my favorite games right now. The photography aspect of the game can be difficult and demanding even on Easy difficulty, i've yet to finish a single photo shoot with the maximum rank. The story is so well written I literally cried because of the heart-wrenching feelsfest the game drags you through before your character will be honest about his feelings in one of those EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT ENDINGS. Just buy the game. Yes I know $35 bucks sounds steep, but in this case it will be well friggin' worth it."

A LOTso if you love a game like this where you have to play it multiple times to get other endings and special stuff this is the game for you!i give this a thumbs up mainly cause its not too bad but i find the amount of endings wich some there are only a few choices different a bit too much but hey if you like detail where a small change in answer can get a whole new ending then hey look what you found! the game for you!

All her dialogues are very well voiceacted, the 3D shooting is very interestingly done and compares to nothing i've played yet, it's even challenging on the second of two difficulties and it's up to you how lewd you want this game to get. Me playing on basically the ""white knight route"", and doing my best to not put active in-game attention to her overwhelming curves, have a pretty decent, mature and non-pervy experience with this. It seems like the story and possible events branch out very early on, so replays are a must if you want to see everything this game has to offer. After 3 hours and into chapter 5 the game still has the ""we're just starting"" vibe and menus still aren't complete compared to the screenshots - so i guess it's very lengthy on each playthrough, too, especially for this type of game. Which i appreciate and which makes the low price a steal in my opinion."

I am NOT an expert on the anime / manga / waifu scene, so MAYBE i am just missing something.... but are they all about sort-of romancing a home-schooled autistic 5 year old that has been hit over the head with a shovel but happens to be the size of a teenager with Dolly Parton's breasts?  I mean, I fully realize that this game isn't going for gender equality, but OMG if this is what some people want in a romantic partner, the world is probably going to spin in to the sun any day and just end us as a species._______TL DR Review:-  Wow is this game a stinker-  Maybe it would appeal to you if you have a body pillow with a full size picture of a anime character on it, but for people who are able to interact with the society outside their basement, wow is it bad.-  Gameplay that makes you want to bash your head against the wall for 20+ minutes of reading the worst dialogue you will ever read, followed by 5 minutes of FPS chasing of circles to click in around a girl, and then repeat-  Did I mention the bad dialogue?-  oh, by the way, no nudity.read my review below, though, because you might find it humorous...------------That doesn't even mention the gameplay or the dialogue.  Gameplay is terrible.  Did I say Terrible?  That is unfair to things that ARE Terrible.  Maybe after completing the game it gets better (I no longer care enough to keep trying) but the first play through consists of 20 - 30 MINUTES or more of stupid, meaningless dialogue (again, a large part of which is with an autistic 5 year old in the body of a teenager with Dolly Parton's breasts) followed by 5 minutes of FPS-style taking of ""pictures"" (really you are just trying to keep up with circles that appear around the character... you don't get to choose the picture angles, you don't get to ogle the girl because you are always focusing on when and where the next bloody circle is going to be, and you don't ever get to look at the pictures you took, anyways).  Rinse, repeat.  Over and over.  Some times the dialogues result in a photo shoot THAT YOU ARENT EVEN IN... the game cuts away for a second and then suddenly you are again talking with the girl and she says nice things like ""....."" and ""....."" and ""....."" (I'm not leaving out characters to avoid writing lewd words, those are the actual lines of dialogue).Oh, the dialogue.... The following is a FREQUENT (it happens at least one over 5 - 10 minutes) conversation between the protagonist (you) and the object of his affection (the autistic homeschooled 5 year old with Dolly Parton's figure):you:  ""......""her:  ""....""you:  ""......""her:  ""....""you:  ""......""her:  ""uuugh, hmmm....""you:  ""......""her:  ""....""Each line is printed on the screen, and you need to click to move past it.  I think the button on my mouse is wearing out from clicking through all that garbage.  When there are gameplay choices, some are so blindingly obviously wrong (example: touch her arm, tough her hand, or touch her BREAST on the first time you meet her), others are blidningly opaque (my favorite was selecting the option for ""Let's do something adventurous!"" while discussing where to go with your career and having it end up suggesting nude photo shoots).Last but not least: No nudity.  Don't know why the game says Nudity on it, but there isn't.  Again, maybe something is out there if you can suffer through the horribleness of the first play through, but as someone else posted, ""um, that stuff is free on the internet, you know?""Summary:1.  No nude2.  Worst characters and ""character development"" I've ever encountered in any game3.  Hideous game play4.  Even worse phases of gameplay that last forever, but don't involve any actual Motherf$*%&%ing GAMEPLAY5.  The soundtrack has three songs that repeat over.  and over.  and over.  and over.I sincerely hope that all the girls that you can find photos of online doing Sonicomi cosplay were duped by their boyfriends and didn't realize the truly aweful character that they are dressing as."

But hey, That's the Chinese party for you.Even though this theoraticly should elliminate any negative effects against the party (The darn monkeys couldn't handle a real western spy.) And thus came Chinese engineering at it's finest with the help of a few ""Cough cough captured cough cough"" German windmill engineers as China introduces their own line up of Stalinium stronk tenks the Type-99 or ZTZ-99 created using the finest communist blood on the market. As it comes equiped with an heavy pounding potato launcher that's able to pound trough any western spies that try to infiltrate our glorious nation.But after this the Chinese bias got huge and the game became unfair even the Russians couldn't stop the Chinese, After some political discussions Korea got involved and the whole issue is at an stalemate now."

There is so much replayability due to the 18 possible endings, hundreds of costume pieces and designs for said costumes and a fairly simple but addicting form of gameplay.The fact you can play freely and just take pictures of Sonico in your favourite outfits, add filters etc and save the pictures to your hard drive is a nice added feature too.On a side note, considering she's the mascot of an audio company and is regularly seen playing a guitar, it's a pity that the game doesn't revolve more around her musical lifestyle.If you're a fan of Super Sonico you should definately get this, it's well worth the money due to the amount of content it provides."

But with this game, it just lags. Mouse sensitivity was so bad that I also couldn't get past the tutorial, which means like Akiba's Trip, the port to Pc makes it better off being played with a controller, than with a mouse. I'll recommend it, because I'm a fan of Sonicomi, but it's good to have a controller on hand if you do choose to buy this."
