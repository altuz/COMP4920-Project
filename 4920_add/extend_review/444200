,Not Recommended,444200,30056594,Posted: 20 February,all,Timberwolf,"World of Tanks Blitz was originally a simplified version of the PC game World of Tanks, for the mobile market. As such, it had simplified controls, simplified models, simplified textures, simplified UI and simplified everything else. This was fine, and in time the game has gotten a small community of it's own. But porting the mobile, severely dumbed down version back to PC, has not made it a true alternative to the original.I'll make it simple for you.If you play Blitz on mobile devices a lot, and only occasionally want to play a game on the PC, do go ahead and try this. It will let you play the same game, so you keep your progression and everything else between your mobile devices and the PC.If on the other hand you don't play mobile games much if at all, and just want a game to play exclusively on the PC, please forget about this. Then you should go download the full, original World of Tanks for PC from their webpage. It's just as free, much better, more content, bigger community and more fun.Oh, and if anyone thinks they can use this game to sit on a PC with keyboard and mouse, and stomp on players running it from mobile devices. Sorry, but there are separate matchmaking queues. Even Wargaming was not going to allow that kind of rampant sealclubbing."

,Recommended,444200,29637840,Posted: 1 February,all,[UK] Vladimir Pootis [SK],"Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone. You progress quite quickly through the game so money doesn't have to be spent unless you're really desperate. However, the biggest problem is the match making. You either smash their team or get smashed. You can be afk on your team and win with maybe one casualty or work your♥♥♥♥♥off and lose awfully. This can be fixed on future updates but apart from that, it's a solid game. Also, you can run it on a potato so that's always good."

,Recommended,444200,29515858,Posted: 26 January,all,homerowpluto,"Its a fun game if you understand the mechanics and know the characteristics of each tank and how to maneuver with them.The game becomes more rewarding the more experience you gain (not the in-game experience but actual gaming experience), being able to turn around battles the otherwise seem impossible to win, although there are still many instances where that is not the case. I personally don't think this is as casual of a game as it seems to be considering that if you don't really have a plan or be versatile with the situation, you can die very quickly missing put on a lot of the action. I must include that it does not mean that you're supposed run away from everything just to survive until the end but to understand your role in the battle and act accordingly. Acting accordingly can mean many things differing with which tank you're driving hence gaining experience the hard way so you know what to do in certain situations.One thing to mention is that this game is not a pay-to-win game and is more skill based, although I think that WarGaming is heading towards a grey area with recent updates but ultimately, those functions are boosters and there is still skill required to be able to effectively draw the full potential of each tank.I ranted on too much and for those who felt that it seems too complicated I'll just say that its not that hard of a game if you learn and think, everything else should naturally follow with it."

,Recommended,444200,29618887,Posted: 31 January,all,Neoki,"Finally found a game where I can interchangeably play from the PC and then swap to the tablet when it's time to do business elsewhere, involving porcelain.On a serious note, I actually enjoy playing this much more over the original World of Tanks mostly because of the smaller size teams, maps, and no Artillery. Matches are very short, anywhere from 5-10minutes at most usually and the grind isn't too terribly bad. The balance is something that still seems to favor russian tanks and their crazy DPS to Armor ratio.The real beauty is that all my progression between when I play on the PC or when I play on my tablet from the app is tracked as one. If you're a fan of these types of Arena style games you will likely enjoy this more casual version of WoT.Pro's:Fast MatchesNo ArtilleryProgression shared between Mobile App and PCEasy to jump in and playGreat time killerCon's:Game balance favors russians with massive DPS.Lower level graphics than the original (Likely due to being App friendly)Seems to be a lot of AFK people (Or maybe people with connection issues)"

The only nice thing going for this is that you can play this same version on PC, tablet and mobile. So you will have the same progression regardless of witch platform you use.But heres the kicker. People are playing on shared the sarvers with everyone. So what that means is that PC users have major advantage ower mobile and tablet users simply because of the controls.But if you are a PC user get ready for numerous crashes and total freezes. At the moment the game has srecwed it self so badly that I can not even get it to start. Did a full reistall and it did to good at all. Has it something to do with the account? Who knows, because you cant chance the account anyways on the PC.Its an ok time killer if you get it to work. Would recommend playing WOT instead if you are sitting on a computer."

Tank levels are in Tiers and beginners don't have to worry about going up against very senior players in much bigger tanks.  The concepts are simple - teamwork wins. You are thrown into a random match of 7 vs 7 everyone will be at your level or within 1 tier of you.  Each map has its pro's and con's. Each type tank has it's Pro's and Con's. Learn them and rule the battlefield.  You can level up tanks, or earn specials of various Tiers so that you can play varied Tier matches early.  A Very Fun and Very Absorbing game.  While in game purchases exists, they don't seriously advantage one player over another in the matches, and they are not required to progress or be strong in matches.Very well formed game compared to so many Free To Play games.  Most Highly recommended."

But I find this game does have problems with it. First of all, this game is a noob-zoo, roughly 60% of the players are noobs. It really sucks when you're the only one on your team actually doing sh*t. Most of the time my teammate won't do anything the entire round or will get their tanks blown up by enemies within the first few minutes of the round. It can get really frustrating. Also the controls of this game can get all glitchy at certain times during gameplay. I'll give this game a 4.5/10"

Sadly, with a broken reward system, it's really difficult to continue playing, let alone spend money. Matchmaking is a complete wreck, as you are are pitted against tanks 2 levels higher than you that you can barely even scratch.This game has potential to be very fun and rewarding, but for most people that I've played with, most have nothing but negative things to say about this game. It's okay, but makes absolutely no sense to punish people for succeeding at the game.If you plan on spending money on this game, you must be aware that it is a real money pit, and not worth your frustration.

,Recommended,444200,29989179,Posted: 17 February,all,Kyutaru,"World of Tanks has one-shot artillery, giant maps that lock your tank for an hour, even more upgrades to pick up (suspension and radio are important), even more credit loss because visibility and ambushes are everything, more chances to get outnumbered, crew that have to be retrained for every tank they switch to, it's just overall a bigger hassle for a GAME.World of Tanks is more like an MMO and you're going to have to be heavily addicted to get anywhere. Blitz is fast, fun, and simple for people who just want casual play.Play Blitz."

Half of them can not drive the tank or figure out how to communicate. But exciting and entertaining game you can spend a long time in, but be prepared to face a hell lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (in terms of other players). They are worse than poorly programmed suicide bots, and they will test your patience beyond its current borders. The bad thing is that Wargaming is not making regulations that would  prevent decent players from playing with the less decent. It would make the game better for everyone, and I am not the only one with that opinion. So many of us would be able to fight good matches while the suicide oriented autopilots could annihilate each other in peace and quiet.But well-made game tho.(I have a lot of hours in-game, that are not registered on steam)"

,Not Recommended,444200,29611228,Posted: 31 January,all,Shitteru-baka,"Update 3.8 breaks the game with stupid changes, takes away things people grinded for for hours or paid for with real money, while making it so that you have to pay AGAIN to get at least some stuff back or grind for for years - literally. You got a couple tier 10 tanks, some premiums, a bunch of keepers from every tier? Good luck reequipping them - it will only take you TEN TO FIFTY YEARS if you dont play the f**king r***rded missions. If you do play the missions, it will take you 1 to 5 years. Great change. Simply wonderful.And yeah, as said, even things you paid for get f**ked, so if you have 30-40 ish premium tanks like I do, you just got f**ked har, no lube, no nothing, not even a warning and a suggestion to bite the pillow. All you are left with is bleeding a**, rage, humiliation and hundreds of € worth of premium content that just got shredded appart and you have to GRIND and/or PAY AGAIN to get the tanks you ALREADY PAID FOR into the state they were in when you bought them.F**K YOU WG, I HOPE YOU ALL CHOKE TO DEATH ON MY MONEY"
,Not Recommended,444200,29486855,Posted: 25 January,all,BigNowzy,"Upadate: 3.8 is a farce and money grab. I had 70 fully equipped tanks before the patch. Now I have 4 tanks. How is this fair. WG expect me to grind for years and wait for timers to get the tanks back to how they were. Sorry WG you just lost a paying customer.I have played this game since beta on IOS. I have hundreds of hours logged.Pros- 7v7 means fast frantic combat very quickly - there is little camping or waiting for action as it will quickly come to you.- Mechanics of cover, sidescraping, penetration, camo, spotting etc work the same as Wot PC- There are plenty of maps.- The MM is +1/-1 meaning you are top tier 50% of the time, unlike PC- Way easier for a good player to carry and win, I have a 70% WR mostly solo.- Game still looks fine with graphics on Max, its not WOT PC but will run on older computers.- Lots of tanks to grind and loads of premium tanks should you have some cash to burn.- Active developers update every month, lots of competitions.- your account will work on mobile so your Ipad/Phone will have the same tanks etcNeg- There is no balance in the MM so the teams are random. You will get lots of blow outs if one team gets the good players.- Bad players, as in lack of skills, there is a limited tutorial and the game is a mobile game meaning many people don't know what they are doing.- It is very hard to gain credits without a premium account (costs gold/money), especially at the higher tiers.- Stock tanks and crew are painful, you can skip this pain using gold to get 100% crew and free XP. So its not pay to win but more pay to advance.- Some players will rage at you in chat- There are still problems with AFK players which really hurt your chances of winning as 6v7 is harder than 7v7Overall a very enjoyable version of WOT which is quick, fun and addictive."
,Not Recommended,444200,30124956,Posted: 23 February,all,Kaveman,"Update 3.8, and now the game is worse.  It's ""Russian Roulette"" with teams.  Sometimes you get a competent team, but most of the time you get 4 complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who just drive around and never aim before the shoot, and maybe 1 or 2 other competent players.Spare parts and the equipment changes were bad, the changes in 3.7 and 3.6 that made tanks even less accurate were also pretty negative changes.  You can't spend money on a game that keeps getting worse.They took equipment we already had, and replaced it with less effective equipment, and expect us to pay money to get our tanks to be as competent as they were before.  It's a complete joke."
