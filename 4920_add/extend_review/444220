,Recommended,444220,29571429,Posted: 29 January,all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"The title of this game basically tells you what this game is about: destroying asteroids as a bounty hunter. The story begins with an alcoholic loser named John. Despite having a messed-up life, he has the skill to shoot down asteroids with his ship known as Karma. The narrative is short on substance and the 2D cutscenes look cheesy and uninspired. The story’s lack of substance made me feel like the story is not that important. After the introduction to the story the game introduces you to the gameplay.The gameplay is a 2D space shooter in which your ship is in space taking on asteroids of all shapes and sizes frighteningly moving from right to left. The shapes of the asteroids range include rocks, lava looking, and liquid crystal looking asteroids. Shooting the large asteroids breaks them down to smaller ones. I thought that the gameplay would include powerups, but there are none. The gameplay is about farming your experience points and the game puts your experience points to good use with its upgrade system. The upgrade system is very easy to use and understand, but that does not mean that this game is easy in any way. There are four weapons available to use and the gameplay is very hard even at easy. Therefore, the game becomes insanely hard at the hard difficulty mode. I quickly learned that it is important to micromanage the four weapons and know when to use each weapon, especially during the hectic situations. Final blast, the most powerful weapon, can only be used sparingly in a level because of the long cooldown period. Therefore, you have use the fourth and most powerful weapon when you feel like you are about to be overwhelmed. Each level is complicated by the rival bounty hunters that join the asteroids. They have different patterns of attack and they must be defeated quickly before you get overwhelmed. You must use experience points to upgrade your character and your ships. The main objective is to shoot down a fixed number of asteroids. As you advance from one level to the next, you must destroy a larger number of asteroids to survive. Every fifth level includes a boss battle. Each boss battle is very challenging and they offer different patterns of attacks. I had to study their patterns of attacks very carefully. In addition, your defense is as important as your offense. If you rely too much on your attacks against the bosses, they will tear your defense too shreds in a hurry. If you feel like a boss is too difficult to defeat you can replay a prior level so that you can farm more XP to build your player level and mastery level for your shipyard. Bounty hunters leave behind green balls for you to pick up so that you can improve your mastery level. There is no penalty for letting asteroids get by you and sometimes you must do that in the most chaotic situations. However, after finishing all 25 levels and farming my experience points at player level 250 for a Steam achievement, the game felt repetitive. Therefore, I do not think there is much replay value after reaching a high player level and a high ship mastery level. I was hoping for mouse support for this game, but I was satisfied with the keyboard controls. The keyboard controls are well mapped for the directional movements of the ship and for the use of the ship’s weapons.Graphically, the game looks gorgeous. There is a lot of brightness on the moving planets and the asteroids look diverse enough as you progress from one level to the next. Each level also looks different enough than the previous. The planets look different in each level. I did not find any graphical glitches. Your attacks with beams, rays, and missiles all look beautiful while your enemy bounty hunters are also firing their weapons.The music is a part of every level and every battle of the game and fits in with the game quite nicely. All songs are from the dance electronic genre. One good addition to the music of the game is the ability to add your own music. However, you are limited to only .ogg music files. It would have been better if the game had allowed more music file formats.Asteroid Bounty Hunter is a decent 2D space shooter with a simplistic upgrade system, but very challenging gameplay, even at the easiest difficulty mode. The story is lame and ridiculous. The background of each level in space is beautiful and the soundtrack is immersive. If you like dance electronic music, you will like the music in every level of the game. However, the replay value eventually wears down after farming enough experience points. It took me about 10 hours of playing to level up to player level 267. There are probably better space shooters on the market, but I think that this game is worth a try if you like shooting down asteroids and improving your abilities by using RPG features.My Score: 6.5/10"

The spelling mistakes and typos are nonstop. The voice acting is unmentionably bad. You have to hear it to really appreciate how bad it is. The whole game feels like the designers didn't care one bit what they were doing or how it'd feel to its players, and it shows because they didn't even bother to proofread anything. Even though it was $2.19 on sale, because they can't be bothered to read their own menus and subtitles I can't be bothered to give them two dollars. Refund is processing now."

There are more polished and better executed games of this genre that you could play for free.Positives+ The graphics are okayNegatives- Low enemy variety- Higher difficulties do little more than make enemies take too long to kill.- Bosses that go on for too long with only a couple different attacks- Boss projectiles block your own shots, further extending the tedious battle- Large Hitboxes take limit the finesse of dodging- Some projectiles are almost invisible against the background- Even if you have sound and music turned off, the game will unmute itself at certain points- At the end of each level, the music unmutes itself, though it mutes itself again when you exit the level- Some boss attacks cannot be muted- Bosses briefly unmute sound and music for voice acted parts"

,Recommended,444220,28462514,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,The Fire Oracle,"I found this game ""Asteroid Bounty Hunter"" to be a lot of fun to play. I played about 14 hours and unlocked all 32 achievements. This game is an old school, two dimensional, side scrolling shootem-up type game. It has 5 unlockable ships, 5 Boss fights and 25 levels of Repeatable entertainment. There are plenty of ship type upgrades for shields, weapon damage, Bonus stat increases and also it has NO level cap. I had no problems playing and finishing the game, except for some reason, the level 250 achievement was not given until I reached level 290 in game. That might have been a server connection issue. I might also mention that there is a bit of lag during some of the higher level fights, even on low settings. The lag does not ruin the game, it actually gives you an advantage as far as seeing what's coming at you during game play, LOL. If you like dubstep music, this game will satisfy that desire while playing. You can even add your own music in ogg Vorbis File format. The game has beautiful planetary space graphics, nice comic style cutscenes and challenging boss fights. Each level is made up of waves of asteroids, enemy ships and all types of enemy projectile attacks all coming from the right side of the screen. I thought the ship graphics seemed a bit simple compared to the rest of the high def assets. This game supports Linux 100%. All in all I feel it is truly worth playing if you enjoy this type of game. Cheers!"
,Recommended,444220,28351095,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,Xenon (Xe),"Now, I'll take this game for what it is. A bullet-hell shooter. It is very good at that, and can be slow and casual, or hectic and dangerous, all depending on what you want. There is a nice storyline, told out via comic-like cutscenes every few levels. The music is the genre of House/EMD/Dubstep, but you can put your own music in, so even if you don't like the music, you can change it. Personally, I adore that, and I adored the music, it felt really in sync with what the game is. Now, there is the occasional crash, but what are you really expecting? Yes, it's chaotic and most bullet-hell type games do crash every so often due to amount of memory needed to render everything, then the music, and controls. Otherwise,  don't completely see why people get so up in arms about this, as this is cheaper than triple A titles and they crash more than this; and oftenly suck more than games of which are cheaper, yes, but you can see effort. Clear effort. And for what it is, they did great. The only negitive I see is the occasional crashing, but otherwise, I recommend getting this, if you like Bullet-hell shooters styled the the old arcade games."

But Soundtracks are pretty good, but game menu music is a bit too loud and noisy.  All the game play went so easy and all of a sudden the boss comes at me with 1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx health and very narrow chance for me to dodge all of his projectiles for long long minutes. Pretty repetitive, I say.Why on Earth my projectiles are stopped by enemy projectiles? lol Id understand if they both canceled each other but even my strong attacks are stopped by silly wall shaped basic attacks.I think the game was designed by nice designers but who are not that much of a gamer.  Only 3D objects are the asteroids. I didn't like the menu and upgrade screen either. its all too confusing with no proximity to separate one thing from another, and cannot easily see how many upgrade points I have left.Plus, why on earth when I finish a level and press CONTINUE, I go back to the main menu?

I mainly buy games for my boy but most are far too hard.  Asteroid Bounty Hunter has the easy difficulty setting and boy is it easy.  I love that they have a difficulty level suitable for 7 year olds.  That is not that this game is for 7 year olds.  I have only tested it (1st 4 levels) on easy mode for his sake to see if I should keep or refund it and it's a keeper.  So my review is purely aimed at those like me who have kids and if this is your case then quite simply just go and buy this.  They will love it.  I will probably have a go myself on on harder mode as the game is enjoyable.  The controls are very slick and the graphics are nice as well.  Good game.

This genre is already exhausted, so you gotta be creative.I remember playing Thunder Force V on Playstation, and that was a crazy experience, with lots of upside down, different scenarios, huge bosses, cool enemies and power ups. And that was 1997.Here's what you get from this game:- 5 types of spaceships for the enemies- 5 types of spaceships for the player- 5 types of spaceships for the bosses- Same model of asteroids that keeps repeating over and over again, just using different textures that looks RIDICULOUS!!! Or do you think that in space we would encounter asteroids looking like spider webs, dinosaur skin, the walls from an Egypt pyramid, or like the blanket your grandma used to cover the bed?- Music is the ONLY good point in this game, and I really don't know HOW they managed to put so many good musics on a trash game like this.- Levels are boring, you just keep shooting asteroids, and the amount increase by 10 every level. There's no innovation or objective.I installed this game along with Astebreed, and feels like going from gold to sh!t when comparing they two. I know the game was probably made by an indie developer (or maybe not, who knows, I don't), but you always should aim for something good.I really doubt you would play a game like this and say ""Oh yea, it's perfect! I like it, I'm a master developer!"". So please, consider improving your game before putting it to sell, maybe getting other people opinion about it. That should help."

Previously, I thought it was an artifact of my four-year-old compy, but, no, it was a feature.  I think performance has improved since last time I played;  refighting a boss showed much less slowdown than the first time.Documentation is cleaned up (though the typeface might benefit from lower-case letters) and I haven't seen more loading screen errors.The addition of two game modes helps to alleviate the level monotony somewhat, and paradoxically makes them more passable.  Normal mode has about a dozen rocks hurtling towards you, after which one or more enemy ships crawl in and shoot, asteroid-free.  This runs up the level timer, which has the effect of multiplying asteroid hp and xp... but you hit a wall where you can't output enough damage to any single asteroid before it runs past you... and there's more ships to shoot again.  Bounty hunter mode keeps the asteroids coming when ships show, or perhaps makes the ships show when the asteroids are coming.  This way, you can keep accomplishing something while the ships crawl in invincibly.Overall, it's better than when I first played, but still don't think it's a must-buy.  Fans of the genre might enjoy it, the graphics guys know what they're doing (calling it merely ""pretty"" isn't fair, I suppose), but I can't get more enthusiastic about it."

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

It's like a ordinary flash game.Pros● Transparent asteroid - fascinating● Music - This slightly kills the boredom● Easy level up and getting MPCons● Boring - because of asteroids● Lack of contents - because of asteroids● Some skill & ship upgrades are useless● Spaceship cannot go under the UITips● Faster level up - Kill Vega on medium difficulty.

,Not Recommended,444220,28897891,Posted: 1 January,all,edooze,"The voice acting is so bad, I almost stopped playing before getting to the game itself.The story is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the game at all.The game treats the player like a simpleton, making buy-in impossible.The gameplay isn't too bad, although altogether seems pointless, as if you miss an asteroid (while you're 'saving the planet' or whatever) it doesn't matter because another one will be along shortly.Asteroids spawned where I was unable to shoot them, which wasn't a problem (see above) but was very annoying.It seems like it could be a really great side-scrolling bullet-hell space shooter. 1942 was a great example of this sort of game, so it can be done well.What else? Who cares. It's enough not to buy this game already. Unfortunately for the game, the gameplay was quite enjoyable until it froze between levels. I took great satisfaction in killing the process.Not recommended."

It is a fun experience that, while tied to the classic asteroids gameplay, does make its own fair additions.Pros:-Achievements are fairly easy to get (thanks to a recent patch, which does show how caring is the developer about this game-Bosses are hard and each one of them require different strats in order to win-Developer is transparent with the communityCons:-The gameplay feels somewhat clunky at times-Sometimes the game can be buggy-The hitboxes seem too big, making dodges difficult"

,Not Recommended,444220,34875267,Posted: 10 September,all,nujumkey,"I can see this game being really interesting but there just needs to be more to the game than shooting things.Asteroid Bounty hunter really wants to be a 2D shooter autoscroller thing, but it's weighed down by meh enemies and long grindy levels.You are a bounty hunter and you hunt ... asteroids. You fly around the galaxy killing rocks with tons of fancy lasers. It's not really just asteroids though, because every once in a while enemies will come up to shoot your ship and suddenly you have a real fight! Except you as the player have a decently large health pool that regens over time and the enemies don't have any fancy patterns to engage with, so you can just sit in the enemy lasers and hold down fire until the enemies die. You have like 40 levels to play through and each level gives you a number of asteroids/enemies you need to kill to unlock the next set of levels and the overall lack of challange is dull. Really dull. The game has a high point when it introduces bosses, but honestly until the enemy patterns are either more interesting or more punishing i'm reserving this game for ""give to the little kids when they complain to much"" category.But hey, good price when bundled with 20 other games"
,Not Recommended,444220,34870493,Posted: 10 September,all,Eterno,"wow, just wow! I never thought until i got hands on this game myself. Reading bad reviews i thought, it can't be that bad, there are asteroids and enemy ships a decent shoot them up, sort of. But no, and here is why.Many people did not noticed this but this game wants to be a ""beat hazard"" you know what is beat hazard? Search on steam, beat hazard is shoot them up and music game at the same time as this ""ugly looking game"". Do you know why? Because there is also music implemented as well as you can add your own. Why did they tried to copy this mechanic? So they can fail terribly, i guess.Let's start with game that has been developed in 2016 looks like from early 2000s graphics wise. Story line and voice acting should not exist in this game, there is no reason why its there. Story is forgettable and voice acting is pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They only say ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""quotes"" at the end of each level that does not make any sense at all. Games background is the same for all other levels just with different colors. Enemy ships are dull and badly designed including asteroids. In fact there are only 5 different type of enemies with same attack patterns. As soon as you see enemy ship incoming into your screen first of all it is invulnerable during first 5 seconds or so before it starts to attack. Sometimes when there are asteroids on screen and some enemy ships appear and attack you asteroids block your projectiles but not enemy attacks, nice cover huh? But if there are 3 or 4 enemies on screen and you are surrounded by asteroids you will most likely end up dead. So that's that.Sometimes your default attack (not abilities) stops to respond for unknown reason and shoots inconsistently.There are 25 different levels in this game, every 5th level is boss battle, but every non boss level is getting longer and longer until it's 20 minutes in and you just died because of smallest asteroid got in way and could not be destroyed by your default attack then you get set back and start over.Since your main goal is to destroy asteroids you have given certain amount to destroy in ever level but you know that does not sound easy like you think, i dunno but WHY ON THE FCKN EARTH developers thought its funny to make that asteroids fly/float out of screen. Sometimes took minute to see at least one asteroid that i could destroy.Boss fights! Well, do you remember i described about enemy covers earlier? You see that whenever boss attacks/uses his projectiles they ""BLOCK"" your all abilities and cant even be targeted to destroy them directly, always have to avoid every projectile that is on the screen and most of these projectiles can insta kill you. HOW ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOVELY.Stay away from this game and developers too. They do not deserve money for making such dreadful games."

,Not Recommended,444220,35000382,Posted: 16 September,all,Tezlakipuka,"For a sidescrolling game, the graphics and sounds are well made. The story is boring and has no influence on the gameplay at all. Aside from the decent bossfights, all levels are the same, just getting longer later on. Way too many asteroids were so close to the screen borders or moving in such angles that it was not possible for me to destroy them.The four weapons are well designed, but I would wish for way more weapon choises. Prepare for a very long and boring grind to reach Level 250.The game can be played smoothly with a Steam Controller, controls were precise and quick.Overall the price is fair for what you get."
