This game doesn't manage to do this, which has deeply disappointed me. Then again, it's not too horrible either.Pros;-Interesting combination of adventure, story and running games.-Steam trading cards, achievements and partial controller support.-4 playable characters-Potential (its something new)-Two modes (story and run)Cons;-No replayability-Every run feels very much the same.-The most annoying death sound of all time.-Slow process from death to running again.-No checkpoints (only really an issue in story point)-You can't save any progress in story mode.3.5/10"

Instead of a jumping square you have squared cute animals that run through a sprite landscape. For a quick reactions game is just the story mode with the simple mechanics OK. But in endless mode you die trying to reach the 10k points.Reasons:1. Game runs laggy as hell2. Newly in endless mode introduced double size spikes3. Sloppy hitboxes - sometimes you die before even touching the spikes or when you are already on the platform above or only close by some water4. Spike sequences become unfair at 8k pointsThe main problem is like in every kind of this game type: The controls are way too rudimentary. Means you can just control the start of your jump but not faster going down or in-flight adjustments are possible. So if you try to ascend spiked stairs every jump must be fitting perfectly or you'll explode instantly. Another bad are the sometimes low exposed spikes like in yellow desert brown spikes. 2/8 chooseable characters are completly useless. Turtle & Dolphin cannot jump over long gaps because of slowness.Update: Dev introduced a new character - the puppy dog - with which is the 10k achievement much more easier (more steaks, faster points gaining). I think it's a great gesture and makes the game completely fun now. Thumbs up!"

I nearly broke my controller on several occasions playing in free mode.Thoughts.The game for it's price is well worth it, it gives you the choice of playing in free mode or in story mode.In freemode you play for points in an endless level which is quite difficult, everytime you die you respawn in a different level, this gives freemode some variety.In storymode you have to find the character's grandma through different worlds. 5 levels(I think) which all have a unique ""HARD"" obstacle which will probably require a few tries to perfect.At the final level you play with an amazing beautiful song that literally makes you want more(the song resets when you die) so you keep playing until you manage to complete it.Here's the song.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI-izMk01EIThe achievements are achieved by completing the story mode and reaching specific milestones in freemode.The verdict.This game is definetely worth the price. This game is perfect for when you have nothing else to play.I give this game a 8/10."

Sometimes you don't even get the character you choose, some patterns are not even possible (not just bad luck or timing, just outright impossible) the only possible level i've found so far in endless mode is the desert.The achievements don't popup outside of the desert for myself and my girlfriend. The game requires pixel perfect timing on almost every 10 jumps.I strongly do not recommend this game."

The only obstacles are spikes and liquid, and every level is almost identical in design to the one before it, with only a slight retexturing to differentiate them from one another. The story mode is obnoxious and plays the same piano song for the first three of a total of four levels. To its merit, it does have controller support, some nifty options, such as retro mode, and it's only $.99. That being said, I would spend that same $.99 on something more enjoyable and similar, like Turbo Pug or Montaro."

In one part of the game (the first level of the story mode, in fact) I keep landing on ground right before a lake of water, yet it's still registering it as if I'm in the water when I'm clearly not. I've also read there's no saving in story mode so you have to beat it all in one sitting. I doubt it takes too long, but if you keep dying because of poor hit detection, you'll get too frustrated to keep playing, you'll close the game out, and then have to restart from the very beginning. The story mode isn't anything special, anyway. Just short dialogue pieces and that's about it. I didn't expect much from it, but for it to be one of the game's supposed selling points, it is sorely lacking of any substance.The endless mode is nothing special either. Pick your character and try to get a high score, jumping over spikes and water. That's fine and all, but there's nothing else to it. No local or online leaderboards, no powerups, nothing to upgrade or purchase, or anything. You do get a few characters but they're mainly the same (except the turtle). You can't unlock anymore after that. There's no reward outside of achievements and trading cards. Those are fun and all, but if you already got them, there's not really a reason to come back and play this game. I bought it for 49 cents and I'm starting to regret it. Maybe if they update the game with better hit detection at the very least, it would be reccommendable, but as it stands now, don't buy it, no matter how cheap it is."

Firstly, storymode would be good  if i could pess a button to restartl! the levels themselvs require memorization but wen you get to the next level and quit you have to restart, I dont know how people can beat the game! Next the main gaime ""mindless Running"" more like pontless running,with your score only unlocking achevements and not being posted on a leaderboard anywhere there is no real reason to play it. plus in two of the maps the traps are hard to see that when you die it makes you want to brake your computer. On the other hand the music is incredable and that is why i keep playingc.3.5/10"

,Recommended,444260,35400452,Posted: 1 October,all,Razonix,"To be quite honest, I didn't notice the story mode at the beginning, I just thought that the game was all about ""mindless running"" as the title says. Well, not quite so mindless, considering that you actually fetch some steaks throughout the way. Anyway, so I kept on playing, and after a while, I thought to myself that this game was some kind of poor excuse to make people go berserk, considering that some patterns along the way can really drive you insane. Not only that, but the song playing in the background gets very annoying after a while. I was literally asking myself, why in the world, there was only one song available. So, after all the struggle to reach the necessary 10.000 points to unlock the achievement, I've checked what else was missing, and finally discovered the story mode. Now, all the headache that I had to go through while I was trying to get to the 10.000 points, made the story mode look like a cake walk. Nonetheless, the point is that this game actually surprised me by throwing some other different songs and some other things (I'd rather not give away spoilers). Overall, the price is quite affordable, it's really good to kill some time and I believe that you can also unlock all achievements without raging too much, so I surely recommend it."
