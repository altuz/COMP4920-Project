I don't know. Whatever it's trying to be, it failed at it. I'm going to do a run down on the positives and negitives of this game. Then i'll do a review on every level.POSITIVES:*It's... um... I like the...... There's not really anything good about this game.NEGITIVES:*The character- Horrible model, no voice, not funny or cute or anything. And in the main menu it dances. Dear god.*The controls- Jumping is garbage, running is garbage, everything is garbage.*The level designs- Just look at the screenshots for this game. You'll see what i'm talking about.*The graphics- Same as level designs, look at the screenshots. There's nothing else to be said.*The music- Kevin Macleod. Seriously. No original soundtrack. Just a bunch of looping, annoying, and repetitive music that gets old real fast.Ok, now i'm going to review the levels.LEVEL 1:What's this? Parkour? I thought this was an adventure game? With the horrible controls and terrible level design, it's impossible to beat the level without wanting to pull out your hair. Oh, and theres diamonds to collect. I spent 30 minutes more than needed in an attempt to collect all the diamonds, but I ended up with 99 diamonds and no other diamonds in sight. I needed 103. I gave up on trying to collect diamonds for the rest of the game. Maybe if you manage to find all the diamonds, the answer behind why the devs thought this was a complete, good game that's worth anything over 2 cents.LEVEL 2: This isn't really an adventure level either. It's more of an easter egg hunt. That's if your looking for all the diamonds. I just walked through the level to the end. The level was boring, poorly designed, and looked like something made by a kid with Unity.LEVEL 3: A maze. When is the adventure? This isn't an adventure, it's a maze. I ran through this maze for about 20 something minutes before I quit to the main menu because of how annoying this maze was.LEVEL 4: I think the game didn't like how I skipped level 3, so it crashed whenever I tried to play level 4. I managed to get it working for a few minutes, and from what I saw it seemed like an actual adventure level. There were open fields, houses to explore, and some towers to climb. Sure the level design was still pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but atleast it was an adventure level. Sucks that I couldn't get it to worked, I may have very slightly enjoyed playing that level.LEVEL 5 THE FINAL LEVEL... wait what?:Yeah, 5 levels. You pay $4 for 5 levels with terrible level design. Well starting this level, you'll notice how the music is a bit more serious than the rest of the happy go lucky music on the rest of the levels. Although it's still very annoying after 2 minutes. This one is the worst level out of all of the levels. No creativity, no adventure (if you try to adventure, you run into random invisible walls), just a path that you fallow for about 30 minutes. Nothing else other than a few houses here and there (like 2 or 3).OVERALL: This isn't even a joke game. It's designed for kids. Although even though it's made for kids, my little brother (age 6) said ""This game is poopy"". I was more amused at my little brothers opinion on the game than I was playing this garbage. Don't ever buy, even if it goes for free. I wouldn't be suprised if the game gave my PC a virus, it's THAT bad."

,Not Recommended,444320,21574404,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,DX,"I browsed through the files of this game, and the orange rabbit is named ""hero2."" Developer could not even be bothered to give their protagonist a name. It's always interesting when I come across such incompetence. Did the developer think this was actually good? Or is this a joke? A satirical entry plopped onto Valve's service that parodies every other horrible Unity-Engine game that shows up here every other week. Seeing as this has now become what is is parodying, that is unlikely.I've not seen horsesh*t like Jumpix Jump in a long time, and that's saying something considering that I run a Youtube channel where I go out of my way to play games like this. Jumpix Jump is what happens when a developer has no idea what they're doing when they try to make a game.Problems include, but are not limited to: Horrible movement, terrible controls, inconsistent art style, and broken controller support. The levels are designed like a child designs his first set of dominos to topple over. Trying to move the character is like trying to move a knife you've just stuck into a can of refried beans.The main character (Hero2) doesn't even look like he belongs in this world that is near hyper realistic. This is obviously because no thought was put into artistic consistency, and you can notice this from playing the game for five minutes.I do not know how garbage like this makes its way onto Steam, but it shouldn't.I'll be refunding my purchase of this as soon as possible."

Another fullscreen game where the mouse is not constrained to the window/monitor. So yeah, have fun moving the camera and tabbing yourself out.Also controls are not clearly listed ingame, only in the Unity launcher. Yay. Music is meh, animations of dancing on main menu has random jerkiness that returns the model to the origin point.Needs some serious work."

,Not Recommended,444320,21232167,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,XxWestKillzXx,Jumping system is really bad. You stop every time you hit the ground so jumping across platforms is more difficult than it should be.Mapping is really poor and could be improved a lot more.The music sounds like something from Banjo Kazooie and just loops all the time.I'm not even sure what that bunny is but it dances and oh god it causes nightmares.Eh.. I'm not good at writing reviews but I just have to say the developers need to re-work this completely.

This game is a great first step towards progression in the furry game dev industry. Jumpix is a wacky and charming main character. I'd love to see him in a comic or animated show. I couldn't get enough of him. Can I get the name of his voice actor?Jumpix had a great character model. Not only did he remind me of the great, talented Bugs Bunny, he also only wore underwear which was a bit saucy ;). Added some appeal to the character.Another thing I loved about this game is the music. The artist who made the soundtrack is obviously an extremely talented musician—I loved the flute. Give the man a raise.I think the storyline and character motivations for Jumpix are very relatable. There's a lot of symbolism. Why does he jump? It's unclear, but we can draw our own personal conclusions by bringing in our own personal experiences. Why do any of us jump? Because it's all we do before we reach our untimely end? When does it all end? I don't have all the answers, but Jumpix sure got me thinking about it.So this was a great game for the furry community, and hopefully some of you non-furries will catch on when you play this game and encounter the wacky and wild Jumpix.""One small step for man, one giant leap for Jumpix,""- Jumpix (just one of his many memorable quotes)- Charles (furry and comic writer)Lilliputian homunculi. Tiny. Small."

The ""Soundtracks"" are 3- 20 sec songs on a Loop who all sound if they were made of 6 Year old i had a headache after listening to it for just 1 Level it probably also gave me cancer2. This wants to be a Platformer but the only Movement you have is ♥♥♥♥ing run and probably the worst jump anyone ever programmed its just god damn awful ( not even a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥double jump)3.

This is without a doubt the most pathetic game ever concieved by human. Yes, It is bottom of the barrel bad. The first level was just too hard. Level 2 was a pain and level 3... don't even get me started on level 3. This game makes Sonic 06 look like Gold. I'm not even joking, I'm dead serious. Ugh, curiosity, why must you exist at times like these. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, I repeat, DO... NOT... BUY... THIS... GAME..... I don't care if you want to play it to see how bad it is. It's not even worth it for that. Trust me, It's for your own good. Not even the Devil would want this game. I just hope I can get a refund somehow..."

You play as a really creepy, poorly rendered furry that controlls very stiff and jumps with poor accuracy. This cartoon character was dropped into a realistic world map with basic Unity blocks thrown randomly around. Reclaim your dignity and stay clear of this nighmare."
