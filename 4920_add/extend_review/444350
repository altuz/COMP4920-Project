,Not Recommended,444350,22815204,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,"New Player, Be Nice","My Impression:I love hacking sims and am proficient in real life penetration testing. I own and loved uplink and hacknet (hacknet being the best hacking sim I have played). I went into this with an open mind. This is more of a visual novel than an actual game. There are minigames that are either too easy or make no sense in the context of the game.Positive:+ Achievements+ Steam trading cardsNegatives:- Price for what you are getting, worth $0.99- Minigames that make no sense, dream sequences- Unrealistic environment, most of your time is spent clicking next. The desktop environment is an area clickable region, meaning you can click away from a folder, but it still opens the folder.- You just click buttons like: download, fix virus, etc. Not much thought or gameplay involved.- Story? There really isn't one. It uses buzz words to sound hacker-ish like script kiddie, keylogging, etc- Extremely tedious and boring with unnecessary screen effects- Generic files, fix_it to fix a virus, let's hack a machine and send ourselves money, not realistic at all- Overall, poor execution on every front of a video game: gameplay, sound, graphics, etcBad Game:2/10If you are expecting anything close to real hacking or a game like hacknet, you will be disappointed. Not worth the price, and not even worth the sale unless its $0.99 or less and you are a huge fan of the genre"

There’s really no story, you just hack random systems and sometimes there’s mini games and choices. And that’s it. The idea is good, but the lack of story really annoyed me. I liked the weird graphics and the BGM, but at least in my opinion there’s a lot to improve on this title. Saying that, I cannot recommend this game, but maybe you can get it on a huge sale just to get the cards and easy achievements.3/10."

When a game is advertised as having an interactive terminal and unique hacking tools, I expect to, you know, have to at some point USE these wonderful features.  Showing the ASCII equivalent of a cutscene of a command line being used in response to me pressing the spacebar doesn't quite fit the bill.I usually shrug off bad games as a learning experience if I feel that I at least got some value for money, but this was so poor that now for the first time ever in my library of almost 1,000 games I am about to proceed to the refund page as soon as I've posted this."

It tried to be funny, but it was not funny in the slightest. It tried to be  meaningful, but instead of having meaning it turned out to be meaningless.

Its not even a game at all.Edit:I was looking through the reviews and the games I already know (Hacknet, Uplink, etc). I retract myself. This game is not even worth 0.99c. It is not entertaining (I finished it while waiting to find a game in Dota), the story is more generic than a Michael Bay movie, and I've interacted more (and gotten more interested) with a chemistry textbook or Wolfram Alpha. It's like a visual story, without the visual part, or the actual story. The dumb silliness of Goat Simulator or Soda Drinker Pro is better than this.Original review:I know, it's called Hack It. But it's not about hacking. Its about clicking next, doing little puzzles and typing in a console with literally three commands, of which only one matters. The story is not bad, not the greatest either. All in all, the game is a lot more of a visual novel, skipping most of the visual part. If you're looking for a game like Uplink or Hacknet (which is what I was looking for), skip this. But if you're looking for a way to kill an idle afternoon, go for it. The only real downside is the price. $5 was a little too much for my pocket. Maybe if it was $3... Be it as it may, at its current price, and having in mind that it had advertised itself as an Uplink-esque game, I can't recommend it. It's not what I was looking for, and it's not my type of game, but that's up to you."
