76561198049465535,Not Recommended,444460,21888392,"Posted: 17 March, 2016",all,Татарстан,"I'm requesting a refund on this game. It is so severely broken that you cannot progress past the first level. As soon as the second level loads you are no longer able to move. The character models are severely uncanny and should be addressed. There is little to no effective gameplay, it's mostly a walking simulator with no real difficulty. The storyline makes no sense. The voice acting is ridiculous, obviously done by the devs on cheap mics. The dialogue is broken and at times incomprehensible gibberish.That said, I don't want to discourage the devs, certain aspects like the overall art style are very promising and the idea itself is good. Work on your character models so that they are more abstract.  Put less detail into them so that it isn't quite so jarring when they speak or move. Stylize them so that they are more unique and memorable. Hire or recruit someone with writing talent to design your plot. Hire or recruit an actor, preferably from the area you wish to set the game.  Invest in a higher quality microphone for this actor. Get a native English speaker to write your dialogue for you, and another to proof read it.All in all, I see a lot of wasted potential in this game. I think that if it is financially feasible, the developer should move on from this project and start anew. They should work on a smaller scale, and work to their strengths and weaknesses. I look forward to seeing this company mature in the coming years."

I've played a lot of early access games and a lot of them were fun right off the bat from the start. This one wasn't. Playing it made me want to go to sleep and cry.

Checkmate, dev."

What I do not understand is how can a game go to early access even though it's barely in an alpha version. What might come in the future though is still not promising at all. The game does not look good for now, or in the future. This types of games are what giving Unity as a game engine a bad rep. I do not even remember buying this game to be honest. I have no idea how it ended up in my library. But at least it has trading cards so hopefully it will redeem it's value"

,Recommended,444460,22393662,"Posted: 13 April, 2016",all,DAZ,"Love is Blind: Mutants is a game with his own style where you are taken to a minimalist polygonal univers.The graphics of the game are really well done but some bad points make them hard to be appreciated, for example during story scenes the dialog boxes are too heavy and break the immersivity of the game and there is those weird bugs when you get stuck behind a wall or inside a truck.The gameplay is interesting with this ability to stop time on click but here also there is some drawbacks, the time also stop before and after an action which is unnecessary and break the flow of the game, the key binding is strange, using ""tab"" to switch between walking modes isn't convenient and it would be good to display the key to skip story scenes, dying can happen and going through all the story scene is long, very long.Don't worry after rolling my head on the keyboard I now know that the skipping key is ""space""...The objectives have issues, if you don't do them in the order the game will broke or you can actually find the required item and the objectif won't show as completed.The sounds of the game are good but the whistles of the enemy are kind of annoying especially when all the enemies are whistling at the same time.The story line has a good start but some elements are missing, I hope that the following will tell us why we are like that and where we came from.This game has potential and we have to not forget that he is still in alpha and most of the bugs that you can encounter will be corrected, so give it a try for the experience."

,Not Recommended,444460,25592589,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,illykilly,"One of the worst games I ever played. I know that this game is build by a team of 2, and usually I support little games built by independent, small game developer teams. But this game is just crap. The story is nothing that catches you, some standard storyline made without love. The graphic looks bad, but the real problem is the gameplay. There is no real instruction and the gameplay just works hard, that has nothing to do with fun. The game is full of bugs, it lets you dying ingame if you just walk into a bug. You also can't save at appropriate points etc etc. This game is unplayable. I stopped gaming it after I had to restart a level because I walked into a bug and died, 2-times.Summary:-bad storyline-bad graphics-bad gameplay (unplayable)-full of bugsDon't buy this game, it's not worth a penny."
,Not Recommended,444460,31462953,Posted: 30 April,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Tactical - StealthAdditional Tags: Early AccessDelete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Too unfinished to provide any enjoyement, more of a tech demo / proof of concept than any kind of a usable productReview: Nice color palette choice, and the idea of a slick click to open, powers menu with cooldowns was a no nonsense way of offering tactical options for a stealth based game. After all the problem with most these games is that once you are seen its often game over, so that mechanic could had been cool if used right. Unfortunately it has mostly some useless telekinetic kick and push options and its very hard to push a character off the edge of the map in fact I havent succeeded once. Otherwise all enemies are clones of each other, the dialogue is so bad it had to be on purpose, or written by very young, or very very very unskilled people, or non english people... its hard to tell but ... it really goes further than cringeworthy and just is flat out ... corrosive to read, and eats at you that such blind display of low intelligence is on a storeshelf product. Anyways I tried to finish map 2 but some invisible enemy started sniping me through walls once i got to the top of the platforms and I am thinking it was just hardcoded there to obfuscate the fact that there is no more content after that"

,Not Recommended,444460,22873223,"Posted: 8 May, 2016",all,TigerTrix,"I like the shadow mechanic to takeout nearby enemies.  However the game is very slow and incomplete.  The WSAD & mouse only controls are really ackward to someone who prefers to use a controller.  Movement is slow, the guy just courches and walks slowly.  Having to use a mouse to select people would have been better if all movement was controlled by the mouse.  But I'd still prefer a gamepad and opponent selection system.  Still, I waddled my way through the first level, took out the 3 guys I could see, searched them, found nothing, and didn't complete the objective.  Just seems broken / incomplete.  The only thing I like is the shadow mechanic that acts on your opponents.  The visuals, control, story, and sound are all very much a minimalist proof of concept. (0/5 stars, buy it for trading cards)"
