For the price, I don't really think I can rag on it that much. It is rather short, which I actually liked (and expected).I did like the voice-overs; I felt they gave a bit more color and personality to the game.My biggest issue is actually that it reminds me a LOT of a free game I played on Kongregate called ""The Company of Myself."" The gameplay AND story is almost exactly the same... and the Kongregate game had smoother/tighter controls and a much heavier story/ending.That said, I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to have anything fresh or new to add, but for what it was I did enjoy it."
,Recommended,444480,21374704,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,rinimt,"You can find my full review here.Broken Dreams is a fairly short 2D puzzle platformer title. You follow Jack who is trying to get back to his love Michelle. We will need to use his shadow in a sort of Braid-like gameplay. Well, except when you're controlling both him and Michelle. Then you have to use both WASD and the arrow keys to move them.The music, while nice at first, can get a bit repetitive. I'm not really a fan of when you're trying to have a serious story but the characters are saying stuff like, ""I can use the right key to get to Michelle"" (so as to tell the player the controls). The voice acting feels a little like it was on low quality microphones at times. The backgrounds are quite nice, however the sprites feel fairly downgraded from how they were on Flash/Android.The game is a nice little time killer, though some trial and error things may get annoying to you. It's also available for free from the Google Play Store, and as mentioned before it is also available as a Flash game. There are some extra, more challenging, levels in the Steam version though, if you want to try and challenge yourself to those. This gets a weak recommendation from me, but there was some things I definitely didn't enjoy as much."

By moving around and copying yourself, you must find your way through the levels.You move around, and then make a shadow of yourself as you return to the starting location. Your shadow carries out the actions you made. You can repeat many times and use your shadows to complete the levels.Pros:cheap to buysteam Trading Cardsmusic was pleasantgood concept with the shadows (reminded me a little of Braid)simple, casual gameplay if you're looking for something quickCons:voice acting was irritating and over-doneshort (but for the cost this was expected)mediocre storyConclusion:Overall, I did enjoy the gameplay, but wish it had been longer. The voice acting was the most annoying part for me to experience. But after buying the game on sale, and selling the trading cards, it only cost me about $0.30, I feel I got my money's worth.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."

The Company of Myself, however, is arguably much better than Broken Dreams, AND is free. Most specifically the soundtrack of The Company of Myself is still one of my favorite game soundtracks.The artwork in this game is nice, but there is no real animation. Your character seems to just slide from one place to another with no other movement.The male voice actor for Boken Dreams is alright, but the female voice actor sounds like she has a cold.The ending also leaves much to be desired. While I won't spoil it for those of you who choose to play the game I will say that it brings no closure to the short story.Overall, considering I got the game in the bundle at 90% off, I cannot complain too much, but I certainly would not reccomend buying Broken Dreams at the asking price of two dollars (Especially when a better version is available for free). Also consider that the game only takes about one half-hour to complete and decide how much money that is worth to you. While I would not spend extra money here, I do not feel that I wasted my half-hour."
,Not Recommended,444480,22088533,"Posted: 27 March, 2016",all,fizzy flask,"Not worth the dollar. Not sure why this has such rave reviews. Its flash game quality and the core gameplay is using mimics of your past gameplay to climb to new hights. This mechanic has been done by several flash games already and this game doesnt do it very well. The shadow replays dont always follow the same patterns and sometimes you get different outcomes of what they do from the same action This is pretty bad, and makes some of the later puzzles near impossible.Levels where you have to platform through a maze of invisible walls and platforms also make sme appearances and I dont see how they could be fun for anyone. Though this game is marked as multiplayer, most of the game only has 1 character and the 2 player puzzles are all babyishly easy. DONT BUY THIS FOR MULTIPLAYER!Calming music was ok. Other than that this game was a completely bad experience. You can also probablly clear the game in less than an hour. I gave up after half an hour at which point I had 3 levels left to do. Any time I have logged past that was probablly idling for trading cards. YAY IDLING FOR TRADING CARDS 10/10! :-D"

The same cliché sad music looping. The voice acting in itself is alright, but the dialogs are mediocre at best and the (half done) tutorial doesn't blend well in them. The animation is... limited. The gameplay's gimmicks get wonky at times (shadows not following your previous actions and not working in level 7 for some unexplained reason).Not worth buying, really."

The shadows that seperate from you and repeat your movements can be buggy, and frustrating at times. The game is the perfect amount of time for a game of this price, I finished about half of it in about a half an hour. There's one thing that made me stop playing, and for gods sake, stop putting invisable mazes in games. The invisable maze in this game is a pain, not to mention (I suppose) you need to use the shadow dupes to get through. If you're consistent with platformers, and have the extra money, I'd recommend this game despite it's flaws."

,Not Recommended,444480,34047637,Posted: 5 August,all,Verdantil,"Tags: PlatformerAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: No controller support. Implemention solution to puzzles is a chore and clunky. Figuring out puzzles straightforward. Story is flat and flavorless.Platformer with one screen levels and either shadow clone management or multicharacter management. Levels always stay the same except you can use shadow clones as platform. In that sense it reminded me a lot of ""Another Perspective"" Broken Dreams is arguably worse without controller support, and with more fluff text for story but it mostly involves a love obsessed stalker and some kind of hard to get valley girl. The core gameplay is always to bring objects to an exit point and rearranging either crates, protags, or shadows to get there, getting a nugget of story on the next level as reward."

I am not a fan of platformers but this one is pretty good. I highly recommend this to those who have a few cents to spare during sales so that you have a short game such as this to entertain you for at least an hour. There is a story, though its simple, which the ending kind of makes you reflect about life when you are in a relationship. Play it and you will know it."

Some levels were catching and took some minutes to figure out, but they were the minority. Most of them were obvious or just boring. Out of 30, I'd say only 2 or 3 were challenges.The story promised well, but made no sense in the end (?). Seemed a metaphor about love and selfishness, but it didn't leave me anything. The protagonist isn't really someone to be remembered too.The music is ok, nothing great, but nothing bad either.I actually liked the voice acting, even if sometimes it was overdone, but that's me.Not worth 1 dollar, I am happy I got it for 35 cents with medal coupons.

The shadow is needed to complete puzzles too. whenever you are using the shadow it will be like a ghost which is doing the exact same walking patterns as you did. Sometimes you need them to step on those head in order to move on. Like making a bridge. It somehow sometimes reminds me of the lemmings but its not close to that. The game is very short and levels are quite easy to beat. There are around 30 levels and you are able to complete the game in less then a hour. For it's price i think it is worth it.Fully voiced over sound.Text font is really terrible and difficult to read.Music is repititve and there is only 1 track.Game is short.Simple Controls.Other things.Music could be annoying after awhile.You can't have a gangbang with your shadows.I Completed the game in 47 Minutes.Playthrough:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NibBgtURKyk-------------------I Give this game a 7/10

And the gameplay?The gameplay is freaking AMAZING.This game is a short, sweet, little puzzle platformer with well thought out levels and several interesting, unique mechanics. I found myself playing it all in one sitting.  I found myself wishing it were LONGER.So, bottom line? If aesthetic is a deal breaker for you, then this probably isn't the game for you.

I don't really understand why the finale gets most people disappointed. It's diverse, interesting, and the actual title doesn't promise something different. As for the narration, simply amazing. Maybe some levels could be more smartly created and tiered regarding the difficulty. Keep in mind that there are more than one way to pass each level and sometimes it can get messy, so feel free to play around. I believe it's a fair game for its price and I recommend it."

Animation is almost non existant. The ""press space and see if you made it"" mechanic is mildly entertaining and you will fly through the game in no time as it poses no real challenge, still I cannot recommend, as it is sub-par across the board."
