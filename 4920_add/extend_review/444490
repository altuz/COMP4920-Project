,Recommended,444490,31029175,Posted: 8 April,all,Clinky,"I've been supporting this game since it was an alpha on gamejolt. I still really like this game and recomend that people play it. If you are thinking oh it's one of those ""I like this game"" reviews, well it won't be I'll give you a list of Pros and Cons of this game.ProsRuns smoothly on high graphics with almost any computer (look at system requirements if you don't belive me)Has very nice design of maps (visually and design wise also not to sound like it's not)Has an okay selection of guns to useHas good animationsFun physicsCan change kinds of sights with a push of a key (literally).Fun and cool weaponsUnlockable character modelsUnlockable scopes/sightsUnlockable gun customizationsBig and small mapsEasy server selection (Easy to maneuver through server list)Enjoyable with friends and when you are just playing online aloneConsAlmost no one is on at all and I'm not trying to put this lightly no one is literally on the game has a counter to see how many people are on and there is usually a zero thereVery limited number of mapsLimited number of gunsHas preset loadouts (For me this is not a problem, but it might be seen as bad to someone else)Doesn't show key mappings or give a layout of controls (so look at the key mappings when you load up the game other wise you won't know what is what)Is only an online multiplayer game (which is a little hard being that no one is ever actually on)I think that's all that I can think of. Majority of the problem is just the amount of people that are playing which is almost no one. I really like this game and if you thought this was a good review of the game and are thinking of buying it please do buy it. I'd love to be able to play more people so if you buy it and want to play with people just do something on here to get people's attention so people will start to play."

,Recommended,444490,28910594,Posted: 1 January,all,BlamelessMilk2,"First things first this game is, or, was in alpha when I am writing this so please keep that in mind. Polywar is a fast action first person shooter with a scifi setting. You play as a geometric soldier with lazer guns in chaotic maps. The map design is obviously well thought out as it encourages the player to jump and engage enemies in the air or to get a better angle of attack. The combat will amusing is currently not well executed though. The guns have a limited supply of ammunition so when you run out of a ""clip"" of ammo there is no reloading. This is very frustrating as I was unable to fully try out all the guns as you waste a lot of shots trying to hit your enemy who is most likely jumping and flying around. This no reload is a game breaking flaw that should be fixed ASAP. Other than that the loadout customizer was very bland when you first start out, with a mix of little choices and a confusing layout it was hard to understand at first. Eventually, I realised that other reticles are unlocked by completing missions which are most likely killing other players but there was very little description on that. Another thing I noticed was that there was a grenade icon on the hud but no way of using it as far as I could tell. Despite these flaws the game truly encourages you to move quickly and get in close to get a kill. One of the most satisfying things was to get in next to your opponent and use the lazer sword to get a quick kill. While there are some pretty big flaws with the game, it is still in alpha so giving it a terrible review would be a D*** move so I give it a 3/5. The graphics were good and the gameplay while having flaws was great. I have just played the new update my aiming worked but soon after another update was released and now I cannot aim or reload or throw grenade"

This game has a lot of potential. More than many other early access games, but potential is not quality. This game is kind of broken right now and the community is painfully small. Weapon balance is terrible. If you have mousebind, the semi-auto rifle has a virtually infinite firerate, the tactical (riot sheild/pistol combo where the pistol is good enough to be a stand-alone weapon) is so over powered I feel dirty using it, and weapons like the hubub (a uselessly unpredictable ricochet gun) or the roaster (Extreme close range weapon which is worse than the shotgun in every way) are practically useless. Right now, this game is meh. It has all the ingredients to be a fun game, but they're not put together yet.TL;DRGame has potential, but is currently stiffled by a small community and broken weapons."

,Recommended,444490,29066857,Posted: 6 January,all,Cen3x,Very fun game. There aren't many people that play this game but when there are it is very fun and fast paced as you jump around floating islands or avoiding lava and fighting other players in low gravity with many guns to choose from and other stuff to unlock as you play such as different sights for said guns and outfits to play in. I really enjoy this game and I recommend it to anybody looking for a fun action-packed fps game.

,Not Recommended,444490,34155093,Posted: 10 August,all,hwolfe0911 | farmskins.com,"Its a poor designed FPS Game. There are major balances that need changed, such as having a shield to block all frontal damage, allowing for easy camping, and aiming issues to the point where you need to either aim so far ahead of a person or just hope (yes you can learn the aiming however it doesn't change my opinion that server hosted matches by other players, reliant on their connection and yours are a poor design choice for an already odd aim design). Your movement is extremely fast, EXCEPT for falling, meaning your spawn location is also dependant on how you can play, as you can get easily camped due to having to ""pull out and ready your weapon.""The game that gives you the ability to change controls, however you can't change your ""reload"" key for some reason, yes I've restarted the game and tried both keybind options. This is already annoying for anyone that wants to change their layout and can't effect their controls.This game is also only wifi connection allowed w/o the ability for bots/ai or even local play.You are also restricted to SHORT deathmatch games so the possible fun with the game can dwindle fast."

I legitamately thought this was a glitch, so i restarted my internet. It was not a glitch. The game has absoulutely no playerbase. This is the downfall of the game. Honestly, this game is actually pretty good for a dollar, but not at its full price of five dollars. However, the game is actually pretty fluid in its movement and animations. You can tell that time went into it, and the feel is pretty nice. But jumping around in a map by yourself gets boring after a while. So until this game gets a bigger playerbase, I would give it a loose recommendation."
