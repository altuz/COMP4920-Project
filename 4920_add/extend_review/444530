,Recommended,444530,22374125,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,MrGreen,"Excellent puzzle game that makes great use of the Vive controllers plus roomscale.A decent challenge that could do with more puzzles which I'm sure will come eventually.I'll definitely be recommending this to friends.Some feedback though:- It'd be nice if there was better indication when you have successfully completed a level. Right now it just pauses for 5 seconds and the music doesn't even change. Probably just needs a sound effect.- It'd be nice for the lasers to 'lock on' when you point it at the correct location. There were many instances of when the mirror would move as I let go of the trigger, mostly at long distances.- I couldn't work out how to see what progress you've made as you go. I didn't know what level I was up to but pressed the menu button. In the main menu all the targets are red and didn't know how to get back to the last level I was on. Perhaps if they changed colour upon completion. Perhaps a scoreboard or progress indicator on the wall in game."

It's easy to lose yourself in the game, tweaking the angle of laser reflections and so on, with no artificial movement mechanics to think about.  A enjoyable, relaxing puzzle solver. Only the occasional fiddly bits, mostly just a matter of using logic and experimentation. The lasers are colorful and fun to look at.Not a terribly long game -- I finished it in just under 2 hours while taking my time, but it was over a few sessions and felt satisfying. If I had one request, it'd be for more levels, which the developers have said they plan to add. I already feel like I got my money's worth though.One request to developers: please no levels where I need to coordinate the temporary stopping of multiple moving panels. The one level I encountered that was the only place where I felt frustrated.  Figuring out positions for multiple moving panels is fine, just give me enough lights to not have to juggle them. Thanks!"

Really fun and interesting puzzle game that also allows for creativity.  It will be interesting to see how it gets expanded over time.Some suggestions for improvement:- Better indication of when all targets are hit (sometimes you stand around waiting for the end wondering if you missed one)- Better indication when all targets are NOT hit (the damn blue targets that are right over your head when you start can be a bugger if you don't spot them right away)Overall it's a great pickup for the Vive.  Can't wait to go finish that last level and hope there are plenty more coming.

The game is not long, there is maybe 2 hours worth of content but hopfully more to come. The controlls are solid but i had trouble in the puzzles which required you to move pipes out of the way by hitting them with a beam, they never seem to move in the direction which you expect and because the target moves with the pipe it will often stop when you miss and start going the other way."

Some are time-based, which is more irritating than anthing else, but it creatively handles the limitations of room-scale VR, and demonstrates how puzzle games can work. May not have a good deal of replay value, but it's well worth the purchase price - value in VR is hard to come by."

I thought may be the game is bad, but to my surprise it is a pretty good one. It is worth the price and I am sorry it didn't work out for you. May be really it is not yet time for VR?Anyways I recommend it as a fun relaxing puzzle game!"
76561197971814726,Not Recommended,444530,23206622,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,Statist,"This game is only fun due to the room-scale controls. Nothing else about it seems well designed or innovative. It is basically a glorified  flash game in 3D instead of 2D.The Music is quiet slow and not motivating at all. When you finish a level the lights above you turn on, but in some levels you don't even realize it and just stand there while you wait if the next level starts. Also i was able to finish the last level without doing 15+ levels before that one.Yes this game lets you choose from every level without progression. Which I even think is a cool idea. But the game has no real learning curve! You have prisms to split beams, round mirrors to merge them and three colors to mix. If you do have this freedom you need things to learn - like in The Witness.Finally When the Dev. addresses his design choice he compares the game with examples for linear progression ""like Puzzle Dimension, Portal 1/2, FORCED, World of Goo, Crayon Physics, Legend of Zelda"" which is not appropriate. The game is not on the same level of complexity at all."
,Not Recommended,444530,23213817,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,Pulsatile,"A mediocre puzzle game not ready for release.None of the puzzles were challenging, especially since most of them gave you more tools than you needed to solve them. Nor did they give much satisfaction in solving. The time spent was mainly the tedium of getting the angles just right. And it took about 1 hour to get through them all.In addition it teaches colors incorrectly. Red/Yellow/Blue are NOT the primary colors when combining light! Yellow light + Blue light does NOT equal green!Plus there's a couple other unpolished things, for example it doesn't show you which puzzles you've completed.Would be decent enough for kids (again, if it taught color correctly), but there's certainly not enough here to justify the $8 price.If some additional mechanics are added that require more thought and planning, along with more and better designed puzzles, it could be worth it. But I can't recommend in its currernt state."

It’s immersive in a calming way and playing it makes time fly. So far, I haven’t encountered any glitches. My favorite aspect is the minimalist aesthetic which fits the concept perfectly. There’s also enough puzzle variety to keep your brain juices going."

,Recommended,444530,22328118,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,794,"Nice puzzle game, I like the concept for sure. Could use a little bit more optimization, it was a little jittery most of the time. As another review mentioned, it's a bit tedious to aim the lights to the receptors, this could use a touch-up.The navigation system also needs huge improvement. You're dropped in to the main area to select what level you want to play. There's no unlocking levels, you can skip right to the last level (I believe, I didn't actually try). There's no indication what levels you've completed, you have to memorize the level number you were on if you want to pick it up again later.Overall, I'd say it still needs some tweaking but it's a nice, relaxing puzzle game and fairly priced. Many other VR devs are flocking to prices of $20+, so I commend this dev for not trying to rip people off for what's available. I hope some DLC ends up coming around with new challenges, I'd be happy to pay a few more bucks for it since I've only had to pay $6 on sale for the base game."

,Recommended,444530,30938507,Posted: 4 April,all,The Big Bad Wolf,"I like this title.The concept is simple, the execution is visually enjoyable, and the puzzles make you work. Could the visuals use a little sprucing up? Yes. But they're already leaps and bounds beyond many other Vive titles and this game has tons of fully fleshed out levels.I would say this game is worth the $8 if you're a fan of puzzles. I'm hoping the devs release more levels."
,Recommended,444530,24657773,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,KubeKreature,"I really enjoyed my time playing Light Repair Team #4. The art style is polished and genuinely beautiful, and suits the game mechanics nicely. There's a relatively slow difficulty curve, but by the end of the main campaign, you are juggling multiple mirror types at once, and overcoming daunting arrays of light beams. LRT4 is decently long for its price, even more so with its new additional 5-puzzle campaign.If I were to make a suggestion for a future update, I would ask for a clipboard showing all of the light receptors in a puzzle, and indicating whether or not each receptor was active. I had a small bit of difficulty finding all of the receptors right at the start of a puzzle; this addition would help alleviate that difficulty.Edit: I must note that I am friends with one of the creators of LRT4. That being said, I've tried to keep this review fair and honest, and I truly enjoy the game."

Could be good for kids, I guess.Doesn't actually use the rules of light color addition, but instead uses the rules of paint color addition.Most levels are fairly simple and you can do them at your own pace, but there were a couple really annoying ones where you had to get things right in a limited period of time.My playspace (1.7m x 2.1m) is technically smaller than the minimum, but I only saw one instance where that made a level more difficult, and there weren't any I couldn't solve."

You use mirrors, beam splitters and prisms to direct lasers at targets.You can walk around the space and aim the mirrors with the controllers.There's a few things I'd love to see - it'd be great if you could just slightly nudge the mirrors with the controller trackpad.Also I think it'd be fun if there was simulated eye damage if you looked straight into one of the lasers :)There is just one thing that drives me crazy though - the light mixing is wrong! The primary colours of light are red/green/blue and yellow + blue doesn't make green light :)Did finish it in about an hour though. But still well worth it."

,Recommended,444530,31533182,Posted: 3 May,all,20/20 Gamer,"If you like puzzle games, and have a VR headset, then this is a perfect game for you. I'd go so far as to say an essential game to have. While it's the perfect length for the mechanics it presents (Which is a good thing), it comes across as a little short in length, which I mean in the best way possible.Once you hit the end of the game you feel as though you've mastered the game's mechanics, and that you can solve any puzzle the game could throw at you. However there's parts of me that wish the game had more to it than what I played, like maybe levels across multiple areas that you teleport between, or having walls that filter out certain colors that pass through them, or maybe something that converts one laser color to another. I would love to see workshop support in the future to add community levels and custom features to work your head around, which would add an extreme ammount of replayability.The biggest issues I have with this game are actually very small, and a simple update would go a long way. When you complete a puzzle, there's no noise or any indication that you've succeeded other than lights turning on way above your head in the city above. Sometimes I would finish a puzzle and just sit there for a second waiting to see if I solved it or not, which takes away some of the good feels you get for solving a puzzle. Also, just a quality of life improvement would be to have a simple snapping feature when angling lasers at their receptacles to make them click into place, which would save some headaches when trying to get a laser in the perfect position, or when aiming at one that's quite a bit away. Perhaps also a way to turn the moving platforms on or off, like maybe clicking in the touchpad or holding down the grip buttons, would really improve the usability of some levels.For the price, it's an amazing game that was well made and provided a couple hours of solid fun. One of the best puzzle games I've played on the Vive."
