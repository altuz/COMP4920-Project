The screenshots looked really interesting and I was eager to play it.What I got was pretty much what eveyone's said ... a maze of corridors.  Repetative environments.  Lots and lots of boxes.  The puzzles are of the variety of 'find the object and put it in a thing' or those sliding tile puzzles that are kind of obnoxious.  I finally got to a really complex sliding tile puzzle that I couldn't solve after quite a bit of trying, found myself stuck in the corridor, and got sick of it.  I went to YouTube to see if it's worth finishing the game -- spoilers, it's really super duper NOT worth it.I really wanted to like this game -- I really, really wanted to like this game.  But I just can't ... it kind of sucks.  It ""feels like"" the developers padded this game to make it extra long.  And I'm pretty sure the ending will disappoint everyone who's got the fortitude to put up with the long walk.  It probably would be a lot more fun at about half the size, if I had finished the game in 4 hours instead of gotten frustrated by an obnoxious puzzle (... or maybe if the puzzles were more varied instead of just increasingly complicated sliding tiles) ... I think I would have liked this game a lot more."

So many corridors in this terraforming base, so many crates.  There are a few offices and bedrooms (I guess) and some store rooms for variety but everything generally looks the same.  The environment is very, very bare bones, not much detail.  Exploration is not a driving force of this game.  I did get stuck once among some crates, so be careful where you jump about. (edit:  may be fixed in future patches.)The corridors are often maze like and everything is so samey looking that it's easy to get disoriented and discover yourself running around in circles once you've opened up enough doors in some sections.There's a bit of a story that's told in fairly decent English (I've seen worse) but it seems pretty generic.There's some puzzle solving, most of which is fairly simple.  There are at least 2 sliding piece puzzles.  I hate those with a passion.  I'm currently stuck on the 2nd one.I don't think I'm going to spend any more time on it.  The game is just not compelling enough to warrant the effort.edit:  (well, since I bought it...)It's been stable for me, no crashes.Also, at the time of this review you can rebind some keys, but not movement keys.  If you don't use a standard QWERTY keyboard know how to switch keyboards on your OS.Edit: key binding for movement keys seems to have been fixed in an update.I got past the one troublesome (for me) puzzle and finished the game, which took about 5 hrs total.  This game is more ""escape the situation"" than walking simulator or exploration game.  Not much story but enough to explain what is going on.  Decent enough if you are into that type of game.  For the price, compared to other $10-15 games, I thought content was lacking a bit."

You really have to not have a short attention span for this - I don't mean that in a ""only smart people with focus can beat this game"" I mean it in a ""this game is kinda boring"" way. Lot of exploring but the environment is too barren for this to be interesting for long. The puzzles are sparse and not especially clever or challenging.The game doesn't make the best use of the space, the story is without any depth or relevance and I think I beat the game but it certainly didn't do any job of telling me that I had aside from bringing me back to the main menu in a different way to death. I won't reccomend this."

The background is entirely told through texts on screen. Sometimes, that text plays a role in solving the next ""puzzle""... in that it tells you you need a bomb, which you find on Oliver's desk. No need to tell you who Oliver is and where his desk is! Just do what you've been doing for hours already: Run around until you find something useful. Be careful not to die, or you have to retrieve everything again.Not that it's worth the effort. Because you wanna know how the game ends?You escape in a ship, but your cryosleep pod fails and you die.Yeah. Just like that. Even ""it was a simulation/dream all along"" would've been better than that.Long story short, don't burden your wallet with this trash."

,Recommended,444580,21608048,"Posted: 3 March, 2016",all,Rainer,"Alone in space is a minimalistic, well optimized, first person puzzle game with functional, nice looking graphics, without music and voice acting. But this is part of the game design and it doesn’t distract the atmosphere at all.The story is told by computer terminal log files only. There are 20 sections, each of them need to be completed at once. (Auto save at the beginning of each level.) If you die at the end of a level, you have to start all over again. But if you are carefully, it’s not a big deal. (mostly) All puzzles are logical and overall easy to solve.It is up to you whether 6-7 hours of gameplay is worth the price, or not. For me it is a clear recommendation.Update: The last level is pretty challenging (tough puzzles & huge maze) and the end is not satisfactory... but still didn't change my mind."
,Recommended,444580,29841486,Posted: 10 February,all,uvar,"I don't think this game was incredible, but it wasn't as bad as some of the other reviews make it sound. Sure, it has issues. Early on you get to look out a window and see a large satellite dish beyond a wind-blown dusty landscape, which was enticing, but it's just decoration - you never do leave the corridors. There's also not really that much adventure except for getting killed by the randomly-timed lightning). The locations are also a little bare - a few signs would have been nice, for instance, even if just for decoration.But the story, while fairly light, was interesting, and the resolution isn't as silly as some of the other reviews claim (I don't know how to do spoilers here but I'm pretty sure it only has one ending which is just vague enough to misinterpret). I enjoyed the logic puzzles, and wouldn't have minded a few more. There's not much backtracking - you might have to hunt around a little but you're never going to discover you forgot to pick up something three autosaves earlier. The graphics were pleasant, and the physics system was surprisingly functional for a game that didn't even need one. And most importantly, it kept me entertained while I listened to audio from another program.So if you want a game that doesn't rely much on sound and doesn't need your full attention (hint - the maze 'left/right-hand-rule' will get you through most of the segments), and don't mind a few gaming cliches... this isn't too bad. Plus it's short - I had the game alt-tabbed a lot; my real completion time was a little over three hours.I did pick up a memory disk early in the game and never found anywhere to use it, though. I wonder what that was about. (Edit: Mystery solved.)"

Seems never-ending.Puzzles are mostly repetitive, and the one room that is truly different, feels bland and rushed.Whatever the pickup feeling I had for the second episode, has picked up and left.Overall the game is decent looking, but could use a shine, especially on the hallways.Gameplay itself is simple to understand, and to get used to.Sound effects we quite well done, but no real soundtrack to speak of.Story starts off well, but then dies out, as it becomes a little repetitive at times.Game  feels a little empty, at least for the first 2-3 hours of play.Seems like there is more further down the road, but it seems to be a ver long lonely road to go down.If you are into mystery, exploration games, then this might be for you, but as I said, please watch all 3 videos to get a accurate representation of the review I have just given.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbnrXWg4_PQ&t=25s&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8&index=80"

76561198183642451,Not Recommended,444580,28770855,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,BadSherlock,"Imagine yourself waking up in an abandoned space station on a planet that's beginning to fall apart. Through terraforming, mankind wanted to make the planet habitable but while doing so something went wrong and now you try to find your way through the space station and its dangers while simultaneously looking for answers as to what might have happened there.I personally see the game in an ambiguous way. On the one hand, it is interesting because neither the protagonist nor the player knows what has happened which again motivates you to search the space station and look for answers that you occasionally find on various computer screens. The numerous riddles blocking your way keep you from getting bored (although I sometimes happened to be annoyed by those sliding puzzles especially). On the other hand, though, the game is a bit dull, first and foremost because it has absolutely no music! A nice soundtrack would have done the game much good. Also, those cool space station doors didn't make any sound when opening. I mean, every space door I know usually makes some hissing sound when opening, like the doors in Dead Space for instance...Aaaaaand then there is the ending... The problem with the ""ending"" is that it's not a real ending! In fact, when I played the game I didn't even notice it was the ending until I suddenly saw the title screen! What I find a real shame is that the game doesn't really answer any of the questions that accumulate over the course of the game...Well, long story short, I am having trouble recommending the game. In my opinion, only half of it is worth the money, so I´ll give it a 5/10."

,Recommended,444580,22176805,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Fallendeglut,"This game was not my favoriteIt has a lot of potential though, with more development time it could be a really great game.Pros:I enjoyed the choice of minimalist sound effects.  Throughout the game the only sounds are of your footsteps, machines/computers running, and wind.I am a math nerd,so having the first password be a reference to pi was cool.Mehs:The visuals were fairly good.  I was running it on the highest graphic settings and it was good enough quality that I was able to loose myself in the game and was comparable to other indie games.  The elements did get a little repetitive over time.   Having worked in the sort of facilities as the games settings (larger confusing maze like industrial buildings) I can tell you that people would normally designate different areas with colors.  The game uses a system of door numbers, but these didn’t seem to have any internal story meaning.  Rather, the next door you needed to go through had a higher number than the last door you went through.The storyline was interesting, but it could have been filled out a little more.  The information was delivered via messages and log entries of the evacuated crew.  The messages lacked much in the way of emotional content and that they were arranged in chronological order as you play through felt contrived.  Having time stamps and presenting them out of order would have felt more realistic.The puzzles were hit or miss on the level of difficulty and enjoyableness.  The types of puzzles wereconnect the dots using circuit relays, slide puzzles to connect circuit relays, and matching puzzles to connect circuit relays.Cons:There is one section that almost made me quit the game.There is a section of the game where you have to traverse a room via jumping on top of containers to avoid a deadly radiation anomaly.It felt forced and disjointed with the rest of the game.The ending is terrible.  It feels imcomplete."

What to say more, except that the game is very linear and that the puzzles are easy (the solutions are often near the obstacles, there's no need to go far back on your track), that the corridors look like mazes a lot, and that the game was made with the Unity engine by a small team of 3 people. Count at least 4 hours to finish the game (for my part I took 5:30, but I am very slow and I readed all the console log stories). I liked the overall experience."

,Not Recommended,444580,25391938,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,vernanonix,"So I bought this on sale for $5. Played it and beat it in one sitting in about 3.5 hours. And honestly? It's not a good game. None of the puzzles presented are anything unique. They're all rehashed tile-based puzzles. I'm talking tile swaps, tile roatation, and slider puzzles. You can see them all in the trailer. The one puzzle-type I did somewhat enjoy was the data reconstruction puzzles, which aren't shown in the trailer. The big issue here is, this is marketed as puzzles and exploration. But the puzzles are uninspired and the exploration is practically just being guided through the level. And there were even times where I encountered a puzzle and I was not directed as to why I was doing it. I just did it. Everything was find the thing, do the thing, get to the next area, and repeat.On asmosphere? This game feels empty. Like, there's no immersion. It's cold. Soulless. I don't recall any sort of ambient music. Just hums and rumbles from various sources. I get that I'm supposed to feel alone, but the world doesn't feel alive at all.Speaking of being alive, a few cheap deaths happened. I might be at fault on a couple, but when you die just because you turn a corner just to be shot with a laser you couldn't see before? That's cheap. Running in the game is frustrating since you cannot toggle it. It automatically activate after about five seconds of walking unimpeded and if you take your finger off the w key, it's back to walking speed. This is particularly frustrating when you have to casually stroll through a toxic gas-filled corridor or leisurely sidestep electricity arcs.Oh, and don't expect any real ending for your hard work."

The Cans of soda, were really awkwardly out of place.SodaThe ReviewThe Tennis balls sounded exactly like basketballs when thrown, which. Although having them in the game was a nifty thing, I found the sound being the same to be kind of cheating. And when you load into a new area, for some reason everything in your hand magically vanishes.Overall it's not terrible but I still would not reccomend it, it has the ability to be a pretty fun puzzle game/story game. Though the difficulty to the puzzles were, to say the least, extremely easy. There weren't many bugs, aside from the once where I'd get stuck, yes I could probably have avoided those areas, however I like to explore in these kinds of games, and having some place that is basically a trap is not good. Though being able to get into all those places is fun. The game was not at all clunky, though everything moved slowly, there was no run button, i.e. you walk to make sure the game takes longer to get from point A to point B.The sound and the ""backdrop"" or walls of the place were all so bland, Footsteps on an ever Diamond plate-like floor, Baseball and tennis balls that sound like the basketball as you throw it against the square/rectangular tiled white or grey walls. The occasional loud beeping sound of a system panel thing sending a warning. (Though I have to add you can disable those on the panel which I liked that little addition)As a first title from this dev, I have played many firsts that were much worse. This isn't terrible, it's a good first puzzle game. However it has much missing, and could use a little more personality. If I could give this game a Neutral score, I would but there is none.Old review with 15 minutes gametime everyone is complaining about.I bought this game with the hopes that it'd be a decent story game. The premise of the story, although pretty over-used, seems like it could be a good a good story. However after walking around for 10 minutes looking through empty offices, long time wasting corridors and only hearing the sound of the footsteps, an occasional shake, and the normal spaceship electricity gone haywire sounds I found myself jumping over a box and getting trapped in an area I could not get out of. From the gameplay up until this point, it seems like the majority of the story/gameplay is going to take just long enough so you can't refund, be grey, sometimes shades of white, and maybe a red or orange something every once and a while.Which a good 10 minutes into a game, the creator of this should have played through that part enough times to ensure someone didn't get trapped somewhere.(Photos of said Trap)HereAnd here"

I do recommend it for those that enjoy puzzles and a lil bit of exploring. My review is below:TL:DRVideo trailer pretty much sums up the game in a whole.Pros:- Some puzzles (slide puzzles, switch piece, match grid, etc)- A story without too much depth. Believable for a futuristic real world setting.- Music and environment that keeps you a bit on the edge of your seat.- Story is on text screens. (If you like reading this is a pro)Cons:- Repetitive rooms, items, walls, boxes.... lots of boxes... (Story explains why there's so many though...)- Puzzles aren't for einstein and can be solved relatively easy.- Most Puzzles are ""Explore area, find a part, put the part in, flip the switch.""- Story is on text screens. (If you hate reading, there aren't any voice overs, it's all reading)The full Review:I can understand why many have a negative review. This game isn't really one to appeal to all audiences, but it does have a niche that some may like. I personally enjoyed it because it's set in a theme that seems real to what our own real world possibilities in the future could be.The corridors can seem somewhat repetative, but seriously think to yourself, the worlds governments create spaceships and space stations that are not asthetically pretty or unique. The game is in a setting of such a world. Therefore, the corridors, boxes, rooms, etc all being similar makes perfect sense.Also, the very story of why you and the planet station are there is described in the story. I won't go into details because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. But it's obvious that the reason you're there and the way the base is designed/set up are in unison with a realistic future.Conclusion:In the end, it took about 3 hours to complete (literally my play time).- If you want a quick enjoyable read in the form of a video game, I'd recommend this to you.- If you don't enjoy reading or expect some awesome amazing horror/gore game with tons of action, look elsewhere."

Many corridors, many boxes (no, you don't need to open them), many doors. And then: many corridors, many boxes...The reason, I don't recommend this game, is the price. Five bucks would be a reasonable price."

But it was. Just doesn't work for me, even with unity you can build at least a bit of athmosphere into your world. This game simply looks like a rubber room. Sure, artstyle, blah blah. Doesn't work for me though, as mentioned.Another thing that didn't work for me was the unskippable ""boot sequence"". Didn't convey any useful information, so it's just a chore.Plus there are black bars on the top and bottom of the screen if you play in 1920x1200. Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together devs.Okay for a buck or if you really don't care about visuals."

The game is hugely underdeveleoped and leaves SOOO much room for more, although, you never encounter more. The puzzles are repeditave and the atmosphear is boring. This game was basically designed like that Windows 95 rat maze screen saver with puzzles."
