,Not Recommended,444640,29878695,Posted: 12 February,all,```skunk3```,"I can't recommend this game, depending on the kind of player you are.This isn't really a 'tower defense' game. It's more like 'tower OFFENSE.'What I mean is that the game modes are basically made so that matches are as short as possible. There's a very clear meta in the game in terms of what towers are best, which sends are the most difficult to defend against (and when to send them), etc. What this amounts to is that almost every game plays out exactly the same. All of the people who have good winrate percentages play like they are the same person. You might as well just be playing an AI that does everything it can to screw you over.Sure, there is a defensive mode, but hardly anyone ever plays it, and even that mode is kinda made so that you 'late game' matches are a rarity. You are also limited to 3 towers in that mode as well.They also just recently patched the game with some tower rebalancing, and it's made everything even worse than before.The quality of the game isn't bad at all... my only gripe with it is that I am a tower defense player who likes to put a lot of thought into tower selection and placement against endless waves of sends. Unfortunately, in this game the meta is so winningly powerful that you basically have to play WITH and AGAINST that meta in order to stand a chance, otherwise you *will* lose fairly quickly due to people all doing the exact same crap. Try doing your own thing and using some imagination and you'll get decimated by an early zebra heart rush. (Which, once again, everyone does.)I can't complain much since the game was free (I even purchased the club pack for it) but after about 2,000 matches or so, I just can't recommend it for lovers of tower defense games. If you are the type of player who merely wants to win no matter what, and don't mind sticking to a meta and doing the same stuff everyone else does, you'd probably think this is a great game. Unfortunately, you are forced to play a certain way.Not a bad game per se, just highly disappointing. The Ninja Kiwi fanboys on the discussion boards are also annoying too, with their constant humblebragging and elitism."

,Recommended,444640,29771308,Posted: 7 February,all,HillBilly,"Bloons TD Battles...This game in my opinion is a pretty fun game in general, It is aimed for the younger ages really but is played and suited for all ages.The concept is a pretty good one also, trying to survive to the latest rounds and challenges, but it's really made to win, you face another opponent and u both have to defeat each and every round, but there is a catch, you can send bloons to your opponent to kill them, but you also get econemy from the bloon sends also.In short I would say it's a fun and addicting game, the graphics are descent for saying the game is also free and good enough for the type of game.It is not a pay to win and this game is getting updated every so on.I would also say it has had a huge improvement to the other games such as BTD 3, 4, 5 and even the flash version of this game.

,Recommended,444640,30110140,Posted: 22 February,all,The Salt God | Best Engi Hats,"While I used to think that this game was horrible due to being unbalanced, I now think this is a great game. It is all about figuring out a reliable strategy.However, I still believe that it is too hard to start out in this game. Professionals (or at least decent Rainbow Ruins) players go onto the Bloons Super Monkey 2 arena just so that they can get easy medallions from newer or less experienced players. I think that every arena should have a limit to how many medallions you can have before you cannot join that arena, such as 500 for the first one. This would make it a whole tons easier to start off, due to the fact that there would be no people with a million medallions just farming off those who have 3 or less hours.Also, Ninja Kiwi, keep going on with such good games. It would be one of the best things in the world to have Bloons Monkey City on Steam (like seriously, it would probably be the only thing I would play for a month)."

76561198125175834,Not Recommended,444640,29553436,Posted: 28 January,all,Ami Futami,"Disclaimer:  The game itself is not inherently bad.  I did put over 15 hours into it before uninstalling it.  You've got the mechanics of Bloons TD 5 coupled with a competitive multiplayer aspect.  However, there are many flaws within the game's mechanics that simply make it such that I would not tell my friends about it.First, the game is straight up Pay2win.  Bloons td5 is good, this is a cash grab.  The game would be better balanced if they just charged five bucks for it and put everyone on equal footing, but that's not the case.  You buy tower unlocks, which give you an advantage over your opponent.  You buy energy, which gives you an advantage over your opponent.  You buy club access (unobtainable by non-paying), which gives you access to more arenas with special rules.Second, there's some balance issues.  Did you spend $10 on the newbie starter pack?  If you did, you have enough medallions to buy the COBRA tower.  This tower makes it impossible to lose versus players that don't have this tower.  In defense mode, you gain extra lives every fifteen seconds, which is sizable.  In assault mode, your opponent loses 2 of their 150 lives every fifteen seconds, PER COBRA TOWER you have.  That is to say, you will win versus your opponents without having to watch a single bloon go by them.  Buy these towers and upgrade them, then wait 'em out.  In both assault and defense modes (both of the f2p modes), this tower also increases your cash income by giving you extra money every round.--If you have it, where's the fun in stomping people that don't have it?--If you don't have it, where's the fun in losing a game where the rules don't matter?Third, the meta is very stale.  At the higher ranks, everyone uses the same tower loadout.  Just google ""bloons td battles chipper farm"".-Did you NOT spend $10 on this, because the game is supposedly free?  Many of your matches will be fair, but if you see a COBRA tower on the other side, just surrender, because you're losing this round.  Not to the rules of the game, but rather, to Teh UlTiMaTe ToWeR!!11!!one!!!-Your energy replenishes at a rate of 5 per hour, to a max of 20.  Is that too slow?  Buy more energy with real monies!  Is the energy cap too low?  Buy an increase!  Energy has a tangible effect on the game, most notably, by increasing the attack speed of all your towers for a short time (a la the MIB Call to Arms effect in Bloons TD 5).  Are you out of energy and refuse to spend cash on the game?  Your opponents may simply have an advantage over you, as they can use this ability and you cannot.-Instead of using towers to unlock higher tiers, you use medallions to unlock higher tiers as your level increases.  Don't feel like using medallions and/or waiting for your level to get high enough?  Guess what!  Five bucks gets around all that noise!-Card mode is akin to Hearthstone, in that ""whoever has the most sunk into it wins"".  The details and mechanics are too esoteric to go into here, but it's even worse than the assault/defense mode balances.-To top it all off, the game is full of cheaters.  Just google ""bloons TD battles hacks"" and click on any of the myriad results to get an example of this.TL, DR:   The game would be better if the following occurred.-Strict and immediate punishment for cheaters.-COBRA towers removed or rebalanced. (Pay money to get these!)-An equal amount of energy given to both players at the start of a match. (Pay money to have more!)-Tower level limits equal on both players in a match. (Pay money to max towers!)"

Essentially meaning they've made the game quite a lot harder for no reason.I'd highly recommend wasting your time on another game.Oh right I almost forgot the devs are quite incompetent as well. Everything you do it client side as well make it a hackers wet dream.What do I mean by client side? Simple: You can download a very basic hack that essentially tells the server that you placed a tower that ciosts 3000 and it actually costs 0 because you said so and also bloons actually don't do damage anymore and it will believe you no questions asked.

Why is this game on steam if you can play it on every flash gaming website? Theres a multiplayer where they charge players for unfair advantages. It all costs moeny. Enter a game cost medals. Why can't it be fair to everyone? Why do you have sell towers for real money?Full of cheaters. Just look at the forums and see how many people complain about it.I expected a good game but all I saw was a cash grab flash game.
