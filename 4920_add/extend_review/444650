People want SOMETHING playable for their money. They are not on steam to hand out donations.You don't even need to make playable games anymore. Just make an attention grabbing description and PROFIT!Here are the things you can do:Gather plastic, wood and scrap.Deficate everywhere (I'm serious. They squat and leave a turd pile. And they do this a lot in full view of everybody).Build an outhouse.Kill German Shepherds (who die and immediately become ""rotten"").You can mark out a zone for storage but once your people put stuff there, there is apparently no way for them to get anything out again.The UI is cryptic and impossible to figure out.There are no icons for anything (just white box place holders for them).There are no descriptions of anything (white boxes with no text)While I was playing, a foreigner came to my camp and everybody just stood around taking dumps in full view of her.I explored nearly the whole map and there were no enemies. I am still trying to figure out what this game is supposed to be. Is it a zombie game? Is it a mad max type game? Is it a game where I can build an outhouse, a fence or a cardboard bed and play it like The Sims?I guess we will have to wait and see.  It's a cool idea, I hope it eventually becomes something worth playing but for now thumbs down."

76561198031069825,Not Recommended,444650,22750570,"Posted: 1 May, 2016",all,joshhorner,"As the game stands now - I would not recommend.  It does not contain enough playable content (and yes I know it's Alpha) to merit spending the money at this time.  You cannot currently save your progress, you can't truly control what your citizens do, there's no real rhyme or reason for why your citizens choose to do what they do.  I would recommend buying this after the dev has had a while to incorporate some more playable features and refine the game a little bit."
76561198014028343,Recommended,444650,22560915,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,ArridNexus,"Okay first guys, before you even think of buying this game, read the game's description and for god sake take into consideration this is an Early Access Game. The creators repeatedly reference that this is a pre-alpha and that it'll probably take two years for the game to be finished.With that in mind, the game at this stage is severely lacking practically everything that makes a game a game. Visuals will become distorted periodically, the game’s mechanics are still on their early stage of being introduced, and hilariously there’s no saving system in place (WTF I know). But….. and that’s a big but, I recommended this game for its stated goals and ambitions. I recommended this game because I want others to at least ponder the idea this game is trying to develop. I highly doubt I’ll be playing this game anytime (I’ve played some 10 min and for god’s sake it’s in all seriousness broken).Buying this game right now is more like funding a Kickstarter with an access to a dysfunctional game. Though, I’m really excited for what’s to come. Plus, they’ll raise the price up once they near official release date, so I’m mainly taking advantage of the early discount.**Edit**The game is ""playable"" now with its latest patch with graphics being more fine-tuned (No more severely distorted visuals, YAYY) but still lacks depth. Many planned core essentials are still to come."
,Not Recommended,444650,30177717,Posted: 25 February,all,Tsora,"Firstly, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The creator has already given up on it and it will never be what he advertised. This is the problem with greenlight and early alpha games. The current state of the game is basically playable but has very little value. Save yourself a headache and avoid this like the plague that it is, a money grabbing plague."

,Recommended,444650,22784316,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,001BlackArrow,Although its in its very early stage and granted there is so much more that needs to be there. This game has alot of potential and is worth the money to support the devloper in its creation. I have alot of high hopes for this game and i am looking forward to seeing it updated in the future.
,Recommended,444650,23351480,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,[LUE] Sckitzo,"I'm going to parrot everyone else and state be 100% sure what you're buying before you do dive in here.As of 2/6/16 it is far from a playable game, a quick down and dirty tech demo is closer to reality. But it has the potential to become outstanding, hence why I recommend it to anyone who is fine with investing in an incomplete game.There isn't much to review yet and as to be expected with an early Alpha there are bugs and issues galore but I've seen steady if not speedy progress on development.So, buy it if you're willing to take a fairly cheap investment risk, just know it isn't a playable game yet."

,Recommended,444650,22681590,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,mearrin69,"I see some poor reviews for this one and, if you're putting down your money and expecting a completed game, then you're going to be disappointed. The developers are pretty clear (see the roadmap on their site) about the current state of the game and their future plans. I bought this fully on the look and feel and concept. If you want to eventually play the game that this rough platform *can be* then support the devs at this early stage. If not then wait until it's ready to play, or at least further along. This is totally the post-apoc game I want to play someday.I did a little ""Let's Try"" on this one on my YT site. You can watch it here:Let's Try: EndCiv - EP01 - Early-alpha post-apocalyptic goodness!"

,Recommended,444650,22560690,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,Wolf_Hunter,"I have played very little of this game for the perpouses of seeing how the game stands....it isn't good. I mostly bought this game because it has real potential and it is a game I have wanted to see for a while. It seems like it will be awesome once it is polished and has some shoes on its feet.It isn't playable - for me at least - in its current state. The good news is the Raod map (http://endciv.de/roadmap). It is promissing and doesn't seem to over exurt itself with over cocky ambitions. It is focused and it has momentum. As long as they do not follow in the foot step of The Dead Linger, then this game will be just right for those who want something of this nature."

,Recommended,444650,26077274,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,Vergoth,"I am going to give this a thumbs up, it's early has lots of potential. The scripting for the AI is not the greatest yet. They like to not drink water or eat food that they have in there Inventory. They even have trouble following orders.Building system it's self is easy to use, Q and E to rotate buildings by 90 degerees I wish you could build items at 45s also but that is me being picky.Click and Drag seems to freeze the game and doesn't actually work.That all aside I like the premise, it's very reminiscent of Roam The Game that was of similar mechanics and build. I hope to see this game develope more and become something to sink some serious time into.Good luck Devs."
,Recommended,444650,22556926,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,Aura,"If you don't understand that this game is in early access, this isn't for you. The game is very simplistic as stated, but does offer some interesting components to play around with.Currently the music plays wonderfully and most menus are usable and working correctly.My maps load with terrain missing (as expected) but I am still able to gather resources and build a fire.Already I am happy with the the very early stages and expect this game to fully meet my expectations. I love the whole idea of Sims meets end of the world. Very interesting."
,Recommended,444650,22556866,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,IncsyUK,"I'm giving this game the thumbs up even though it still needs a lot work, but hey folks its Early Access and on its first day of release. I personally dont think the asking price is extortionate, hell I'll go out on Friday night and spend five times the cost of the game and have nothing to show for it in the morning.Now for the review.....At this time of this review I have just over 2hrs of  gameplay and a few things i need to mention. This game was only released today and i expected it to a bit buggy with some features lacking but theres loads of features missing or not implemented yet i should say. Crafting is very limited, with only a fire, cardboard bed, light, toilet, storage barrel, fence and crafting bench to build at the moment, the crafting bench doesnt work for me although it does give me a produce option which is all blank, Im also unable to plant any crops so anyone expecting these features now may want a wait for a few updates before purchasing it. Overall I'd say its worth its current purchase price but it definatly needs work."
,Not Recommended,444650,22634166,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,Rick Dragon,"The early access accussations are sadly accurate but the idea for this game can make it a long way. They just really need to quickly update it with some of the key feautres without compeletly broken bugs, just 1-2 shanties, or even just a save. As of now its a thumbs down but has big potential to become a bunch of thumb ups"
