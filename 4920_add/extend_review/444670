Colourful graphics, great soundtrack, a promising start.The gameplay is tricky without being infuriating. You can ease yourself into the flow of the game with various options that make things a little more forgiving; The AI and tracks have variable difficulty. Create the race you want.What sets this out from other future racers? Procedurally generated tracks, vertical shortcuts and GIANT SPACE BALLS. That's the genius of it. Can't wait to see what's next for the game. *FIRST IMPRESSIONS VIDEO BELOW...*https://youtu.be/k6tfMPHNKWo"

I miss the old days of having friends over and raging over a game of Mario Kart!!!The Pros:I LOVE cheating!Great GraphicsRequires thinking ahead, and the tracks are randomized every time.Controls are intuitive and easy to learn (I played with a controller)Would make a great party / drinking gameVery fun, and skill pays off.The music is great, although not many tracks.The Cons:(There really arent too many.)Few levels to choose from (I'm sure this will change soon)Bouncing can sometimes be unpredictable, but hey. tough luck, STOP CHEATIN!No online play as of now.Once this game is finished I believe it will be, and should be in every competitive online players arsenal.If you liked this review, Sub to my page! I review all sorts of new games!!! Thanks! =)"

,Recommended,444670,22918547,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,Apothecarrion,"Much like the iOS game, this is game is inspired by the shortcuts you would find in rainbow road on mario kart. You race down a winding path with no edges and attempt to get down the farthest or the fastest (depending on mode)... to do that youll be flinging yourself off the edges and aiming for the track below to gain a huge advantage. They balance this by allowing you only 5 seconds off the track, meaning you have to pick your shortcuts carefully.This game is VERY early access at the time of this review, with online multiplayer and career mode being absent. The modes and local multiplayer it does offer though I do feel justifies the price.Survival mode is much like the iOS orginal in that you are just trying to get the farthest down the hill,  speed isnt a factor. This mode is great for high score challenges with friends.Racing mode is a new addition, and like the name suggests youre racing down a predetermined length course against ai or local opponets. When online multiplayer is completed I expect this to be the main mode I play.And time atack mode, which has you going through gates every 10 check points to gain more time to go farther. In my opinion this mode goes against the spirit of the game but it does offer an interesting challenge as the check points get farther and farther away.All in all its far superior to its iOS counterpart, the controller support alone accomplishes that. A game where you spot your landing like this just doesnt work great when youre tilting your screen around. At 8 bucks I feel like there is enough there right now to justify the purchase, but waiting for updates and a sale may be your best bet if you arent sure from the trailer and this review."

Like a deathstar or tie fighters flying by for example.Or make completly new maps with different gameplay.Please improve the free fall movement it's to simple/linear in my opinion.Anyway keep it going guys i see lot of potential in this!"

You roll off, you're gone. Or are you? Plummet past your opponents, land just right, and you're ahead of the race. And what a sensation! This game will put butterflies in your tummy and a grin on your face."

76561198093427784,Recommended,444670,25993112,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,Ominous_Paladin,"Early Access review:  Will edit as updates come out.TLDR:  Currently a fun single player as well as couch co-op timekiller with a reasonable price tag.Bored and reading comments version: Super Impossible Road or SIR as the devs and I call it, is a little idea with big potential.Current Cons:  Limited to 3 roads and only a couple songs, online multiplayer and career are not currently in game.Whether the idea to make a racing game about cheating was an accident or a stroke of genuis remains a mystery.  What I do know is that it's freaking fun.  I was the kid no one liked to play Mario Kart with becasue I always focused on the chincy spots to use boosts and cut across as much track as possible.  Now its not just an exploit, its the principal mechanic.Falling off the track and landing 50 feet ahead may not sound like much, but when you get 5 seconds of freefall that refreshes every time you so much as graze the track, magic can happen.  Granted this is a curse as much as it is a blessing.  Without passing through gates to progress your respawn point, an incredible run ruined by one bad bounce can send you back to the starting line and irredemably far behind.  That's just the thing too, bouncing can and will happpen, and mastering it can be tricky.  Sometimes you bounce straight up and time out just hovering there, other times you get pitched impossibly far to the side where the road simply isn't.Then there's the tension, and feeling of panic.  Much like hearing the warning of Mario Kart's blue shell which puts your blood on ice, seeing an opponent fall ahead of you and skip 30 gates is terrifying.  Suddenly your killer lead has evaporated and you need to start getting risky to catch up.  You take jumps where you normally wouldn't, you expend your boost trying to keep up only to blackout and respawn.  Disheartened you look at your position and realize it still says 1st.  This is a frequent occurence, just because they passed you, doesn't mean they're ahead of you.Couch co-op gets competitive as hell cause you can see when your friends are taking jumps and you start reading their path to see if they can catch you.  Races are short enough too, unless you dial up the distance and complexity of the course so rotation of players usually isn't an issue.  If you don't have local friends, beating thr AI is plenty of fun, and there's a survival mode with leaderboards that are frankly insane.When online multi happens along with the career, this game is going to become huge, at least I hope.  A dedicated dev with a great idea, I'd hate to see it fall flat.All this is bundled with a sweet soundtrack and stunning visuals."

,Recommended,444670,23619055,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,CMax,"So far, this game is very fun and it's good at killing some time. Since the online multiplayer isn't ready yet, I can only assume that the multiplayer will be as good, if not better than the single player. Even though there's no multiplayer, you can still compete against people by trying to beat their high scores on the leaderboard. I also really like the art design of the game. Overall it's a good time killer that looks nice."

At this price of $8.50 it's ok to buy it but the game itself feels empty, there is so much stuff to be added and that's why this is on Early Access. Things like more sound effects and music (main menu doesn't have music), an exit button (you have to press alt+f4 to close the game). Everything else it's good, the game just came out a few hours ago and I really wanted to buy this. Online multiplayer it's coming soon so you should buy it to practice the mechanics of the game."

I didn't expect my favorite iphone game to have an improved PC version!Immediately bought it after I saw it. Everything is just so much better! From the awesome graphics and music to the fact that custimization exists (though there aren't too many at the moment). I also cannot wait for the release of online play which is a feature I so wished existed in the original game.There are some minor issues like leaderboards not updating as soon as you finish a game (you'd have to quit and enter the game mode again), music stops playing after a while.

,Not Recommended,444670,29014251,Posted: 4 January,all,ZeZerT,"Can't say that the game is bad, but.. I see those bad points, without pros.-A race game where we can't slow down. Don't tell me it's because it's early access, that's a basic thing that would have been added at least before the boost if they wanted to.- The shortcuts, said 'epic' in the game description, are actually shortened by their reset mechanic : if you fall for too long, you get a forced return on the track to your original position. It kills the whole point of this game, imo.The game is still early access so there isn't much to do yet, or to comment about. A single track race, a daily track and split-screen."
,Recommended,444670,23162553,"Posted: 23 May, 2016",all,Ranen,"Just bought this game and it is just as freaking awesome as the trailers show. It is common that what is shown in trailers and in description is vague, but what you see is what you get. Crazy steering, a good balance between luck and execution, competitive in the best way, where even the 8th place scrub can come in at first if they execute a great move.This will be amazing with friends, where even skilled players can be beat by their scrubby friends, and for good reasons.Marble controls similar to Super Monkey Ball, with a continuous procedurally generated downward track.A true gem, worth its pricetag, and I can't wait until the new content comes out."

Lose the red strips that run along the track everytime I go through a gate. It's distracting. I'd rather see my opponents in front of me.2. In the menus, if I keep teh arrow-keys pressed, the selection should move automatically.3. Along with split-screen playing capabilities, why not add the ability to multi-play over LAN? I mean, 2 discreet PCs on lan playing against each other.All in all, a very promising and scalable game. I can't wait to see it in full-bloom!"

But the more you cheat, the more you win. It is really good. Support this game, it is worth the full price.Also realize that currently in the time of writing this review, I have only about 3 hours in the game, however I have started about 80-150 races (from reseting and the fast paced cheating of this game). This game is both for casuals and hardcore players and if the community grows larger, this game would be an amazing competitive tourney game."
,Recommended,444670,22961985,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,DeathTheFreaky,I just bought this game and tried it for couple of minutes to see if it would be fun to play with some friends.And after trying all different types of course difficulty I'm realy looking forward to trying it with some friends.The difficulties seem to be appropriate and the controlls feel quite good (only the turning speed feels a bit too slow for me).I only miss a view more different track parts like loops or speedups or some other crazy s*** but as this was just the first release I'm sure there will be more.The only big problem is the missing exit button for the game that will hopefully be in with a hotfix in a view days.As I said in the beginning. I have not played it with friends yet but I'm looking forward to a play session full of screaming and rediculous actions.

It is totally addictive, and you only need a few rounds to get the hang of it. Yes, it is basically a racing game, but we realized that the racing game fans in our group did not have a huge advantage, which is good. Actually, everyone of us won some rounds and that's got to do with some key features:First, all tracks are random generated, which is necessary for this game, since you can't lean any track. Second, the idea is to take shortcuts wherever you can, because it is much faster than to stay on the road. This is a concept of risk an reward... sometimes you are 4th and go for it, make that awesome huge shortcut just before your screen fades and are back in the picture. On the other hand you can be first and afraid of losing time risking a shortcut and not making it to the road again... so the game balances itself. Sure, you get a good feeling for where to take shortcuts and get better doing it, but since the tracks are always random generated, everbody has good rounds as well as bad rounds where nothing you try seems to  work.The current content is enough to enjoy maybe half an hour to an hour at a time and to keep us coming back. I really would like to see more parts to customize your ball, maybe some additional environment. It's still early access, though, so there might be coming more.At least - and I can't say that for a lot of EAccess titles - this game looks awesome and gameplay is polished and flawless. I think it is a really addictive and fun 4-player game, especially as we didn't expect it to be that good!"
