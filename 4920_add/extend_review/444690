I have played this with friends and the co-op play looks promising.2.  It has potential and very active Devs.3.  The Devs are listening to the players.It does have some frustrating balance and bug issues, but they are being worked on regularly.The game needs a lot of polish and content, but that's what Early Access is for."

These military guys cut the power of my facility while i was still doing the tutorial quests. One of the quests asked me to hunt animals but i could not pull the trigger when that little raccoon was running up to me.During the day i was doing fine but at night this game get's a lot harder. Had a lot of fun driving around with the train and shooting stuff until i realized i did not have any food. Had 70-90 FPS all the time on a GTX980 with maximum settings.

(Robots will follow you if you want)I recommend to the lovers of this kind of Survival to buy it now that it's on discount.It is worth support developers hoping to continue to update and improve it as they are already doing."

Its a co-op and thats is a rare thing.  i like when a good team can get things done and pull off big things!
,Recommended,444690,25451770,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,Corrosion,"Alright, so I like the game a lot so far but it is certainly full of bugs, and problems. I'll give you a basic run down. Take in mind it is still in Early Access.It runs horribly at around a 25 fps and I have a kick♥♥♥♥♥gaming computer. It runs very choppy, and no matter how I change the settings, nothing seems to improve this. Combat isn't really hard in the game if you've played things like STALKER. You'd know what to expect.The looting is very straightforward and is very similar to the looting process of 7 Days to Die. I like how it is.The graphics are good but again, the game has a hard time running at the moment. Especially shadows, they only render when you're near them so the game looks really bright up until you're next to a tree. Then it's like night fell in mid day.I can't figure out how to do anything at the base so I haven't even touched that. Everything I've done has been exploring and fighting soldiers.I haven't tried coop just yet, my friend is still downloading this but I think that'll be fun. You can host your own servers and that was a selling point for us. No hackers this way.Rating: 6.5/10 so far. Room for improvement? Most definitely. I see this turning out to be really good. Hopefully these devs aren't like the tons of others who put out a somewhat decent zombie game then leave it after a month and call it finished.NOTE: THE COMBAT IS HARD WHEN YOU'RE LAGGING SO BADLY YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR SIGHTS ON THE ENEMY."

The PVE combat is awesome.  Love fighting against military and mutants.  It is a hard hard game but feels really rewarding when you accomplish a task. Definitely worth supporting as it can only get better with such reliable and caring developers. Feels like a less-fluid co-op version of escape from tarkov, and that is a good thing!  Very impressive for 20$ and bugs are few and far in-between.  No game-breaking ones so far."

,Not Recommended,444690,25618954,"Posted: 21 September, 2016",all,badnesso,Its like DayZ but everything is even more staged and generic. Loot the same locations and hope for different results.  Then upgrade your generic staged base on a small map.  Kill stuff and it falls over dead. AI is extremely basic.  I stopped playing after 18minutes cause I knew if I went 1-2hours I couldn't refund and I'd never touch it again.  This game is the same as any other survival fps just much more generic and with much less content.  I will say graphics while looking blocky and outdated game ran smooth.  I'm going to go ahead and say this game lacks imagination and feels too outdated to go anywhere.
,Recommended,444690,25826621,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Holden_Mcgroin,"TL/DR base game released, pretty good for a few hours single player entertainment. Don't count on any new content.The the concept is great, it has a nice feel to it. There is huge potential, change of ownership with new developers so see what happens. Meanwhile the game has had a price drop.As it stands the game is what it is. Basically finished and probably a few hours worth of gameplay before it gets too repetitive for anybody except the most hardcore stoner. Still worth the money if you have it spare and want a few evenings entertainment, or definitely worth it in a sale or discount key site/bundle.I can't really understand the mixed reviews to be honest. Sure the graphics have their own style, but it's a clean look.  I had no FPS problems on a fairly middle of the road system (i7 3.4, 16mb ram and a gtx750ti) smooth play with graphics all set at very high and still looks great.Maybe some people didn't watch the first-look videos or skipped the in-game video tutorials, or possibly some of us expect too much too soon from an Indie developer, but the game is OK.I'd definitely recommend this with a bit of caution, know what you are buying, enjoy the good bits."
76561197961522486,Recommended,444690,34568257,Posted: 28 August,all,PUPPYKICKER,"Alritey my fellow gamers,I saw this game and went to its store page.  It looked very interesting even despite the few negative reviews.  Here is my review, as of 08/17/2017, in the game's current state.I think this concept is absolutely awesome.  Study and capture the infected, maintain your base, install security ( turrets, robots ) , play with friends, loot enemies that are military and take over their territory, even scavenge locations and take raw resources from things such as wild animals.  However, I havent found many animals besides raccoons?  I can hear bears but I havent actually seen one yet.  The graphics are also rather beautiful at times.  I had no idea you could jump in the water and when doing so, the contrast changes as well as the sound effects of submerging in water.  This is awesome.The highlights of what I believe need immediate attention and fixing are the combat mechanics and FPS drops.  I do not have a low end computer.  I have a high end PC.  I have great FPS in this game (60+) , but at random times or more of , random locations, there is a HUUUGE FPS drop that brings me 10 fps.  Its almost as if some areas are optimized and some are not.The mechanics of weapons when in combat with Military or Mutants, this is the main problem that I have found that has turned me sour.- At times if you are close to any sort of object , tree, car, rock, and you decide to shoot back at an enemy who has zero problem hitting you, you shoot and a black bullet mark/hole appears in mid-air almost as if you are shooting at an invisible wall that you can not see.  I have wasted entire clips shooting enmies only to see bullet holes literally floating in mid air in a wall that I can not see.- The Desert Eagle handgun?  It is a 1911 .45 cal side arm, that is labeled as a desert eagle.  The iron sights are literally UNEVEN.  It is almost as if your character is holding the weapon at such an angle that he wants you to question the craftsmanship of the weapon.  One side of the iron sight is higher than the other and the barrel appears to point to a North Western angle.  I do not understand this.  Also, I have a huge love for sidearms/pistols/revolvers/ call them what you will, and this killed it for me.- The guns in general feel very clunky and just not equal or right.  I hope they tweak the weapons to feel more realistic or atleast just more functional and fluid.I am an optimistic person and I do not bash, hate, or try to ruin any team's idea whether it be a video game, a movie script, or a play.  I will rate this a positive review only because I hope this project is unlike a large portion of other early access games and it will improve and become what it was meant to be.  Anyways, it's still afun game.  More fun with friends.  But it does need some work."

This isnt a horrible game, it has a ton of potential and from reading the devs posts they seem to realy care about the quality of their product and i look forward to coming back to this game when its had a little more time in the oven.I do like alot of what ive seen it just needs alot of polish. I think with a dev like this that cares and some time to work on some issues and features this could be something realy good. To be honest i wish steam had a one to ten rating system rather than a straight yes or no, because i dont think its bad enough to say ""dont play it"" but i dont think its good enough to recomend either id give this game a 6.5 if they had a system like that.What i can say is this, If your into survival games and are willing to put tough it out though some bugs then your gonna like it.I know most E.A. games are a gamble and most devs just try a smash and grab with your money (*cough* Ark *Cough*) but these devs seem to want to make a good product and if they stick with it like i think they will then this will turn out to be something realy awesome and i look forward to playing it when it dose.First off i had to uninstall steam VR to be able tro play this. with Steam VR installed the game would try to launch both and crash both. once i got in it wasnt horrible but theres nothing great or new here. Its as average as you can get and WAY over priced. In its current state i wouldnt buy it for more than 5 bucks. charging 20 for something so average and boring is just plain greedy"

The progression and constant fight to keep the enemy numbers down is interesting.  Spent about an hour running around trying to find electronics.  The scavenging is fun. Can't wait to see more items and variance in what you can use.  Could be a solid title, but as with all Early Access, only time will tell.

I play early access & give credit where its due, however Steam does not need this game. Between the bugs, and plain un-fun gameplay, I feel this game could never have a healthy player base, let alone be fun all alone. The map is uninspired to say the least, the looting is long and repetitive, only to find one or two of the same resourses.All in all I see no potential here, even if it gets smoothed out some. This is a game trying to mimic other games that are already doing fine and well.These developers need some creativity, and a whole new project."
,Not Recommended,444690,31941797,Posted: 24 May,all,Alpha Wolf™,"It's kind of a fun game to play. But, it has a LOT of issues. The new owners have done nothing but drop the price of the game. No new updates. Nothing. I bought the game just before the price drop, but, since I already had over 2 hours, I was unable to refund it to get the lower price. Which sucks.Anyway, the game is fun for approximately 3 hours. After that, it become bland and you start nitpicking on all the glitches and graphics.Anyway, if I could refund this game I would. In it's current state, it's worth about $5.99 US.  At $9.99 US, it's still too hefty for what you get. The original price was a rip off. Yeah. I'm a sucker and I got caught with my pants down on this one.Do I recommend this game? Sure. I had fun. 3 hours of gameplay was cool. But, at the current or the original price? No. I cannot give this game a thumbs up because of the price. If the new owners start updating this game, I might come back and change my review."

,Not Recommended,444690,29433603,Posted: 22 January,all,Steph,"I'm all about zombie survival and stuff, but this one is not something that I can get into. First of all, you get a box full of starter supplies, which ruin the whole aspect of scavanging. Then you have no option to change settings while in a coop game, so make sure you have everything set up how you want it or you will constanly have to go to menu to change it. Once soldiers are killed they just stand there in a frozen state, making you think they are not dead, causing you to waste ammo on shooting them more. Robots will only follow the person hosting the game. Also, locked doors keep turning to automatic, even without changing them. I'm sure there are more but these are the most annoying ones. Objective list could be a little more condensed without having to toggle them all off. Crosshairs would also be nice.Coop is almost unplayable for me because of the massive frames drop, in which I get 2-5 FPS in most places, making it hard to defend myself."
