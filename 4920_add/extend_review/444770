As enthralled as I was with its predecessor I still had some issues with it. My main issues were to do with it being an android port. This was addressed with this sequel which was designed as both an Android and PC game.The artwork in the original was lovely but this is a significant upgrade The artwork is sharper, brighter and looks smoother. The voice effects also sound better. Mimpi can now take tinkles on checkpoints… no cleanup needed!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=767081362The developers clearly made the decision to take the challenge out of the puzzles in this follow up. I played the latest Factory level in the game and the difficulty hasn’t changed There is also a controller bug in on one of the puzzles in that level. This appeared to be addressed in the challenge mode, where you only have one life. However, as previously mentioned with diluted difficulty you have to question how much of a challenge it is. I can only speculate the reasons for this but personally for me this was a disappointment.Regardless you will find this casual, light puzzle platformer extremely cute, charming and relaxing. If you are looking for something to play a few hours and leave a smile on your face you can’t go wrong with joining this little dog’s dreams.My conclusion is that I can’t give this a negative review because of lack of more challenging puzzles. This is still quality game riding with a lot charm. I don’t regret playing this but given the choice between this and the original? For me its Mimpi not this one.When you purchase the game you will also get free updates as new levels are finished. This game is also an easy perfect game for achievement hunters.  I personally hope that in the future if they decide to another Mimpi or update in the future there is an option of more challenge or it is increased.I purchased both Mimpi games at full price and didn’t regret it. Since then the price has been reduced. If you don’t own any of these games and you think that this game is for you would bebarking madnot to pick up the bundle deal at the steam store:http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/338/"

Not much of a challenge, but great for anyone who wants a bit of casual gaming. It wasn't everything I hoped it would be, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.Couple warnings though: The sound effects when the dog ""dies"" are quite realistic, and I found them very distressing. If you've ever played a worgen in WoW, you know what I'm talking about. Second, there is a slider puzzle."

The price isn't to high and for the experience you get it's definitely worth it. I loved playing this game and I can't wait for more levels to be added! Good job Silicon Jelly, keep it up."

,Recommended,444770,34097586,Posted: 8 August,all,NyappiCat,"Super cute game! The music is nice and graphics are adorable. it gets increasingly more difficult to find all the bulbs and bones, so the game design is quite good. I like how there's no explicit dialog, because it would probably just get awkward and the mechanics are so simple that not much explanation is needed. Also, in the beginning the game will help you out if you get stuck and no matter how far you get, there are always hint balloons that'll help you figure out the puzzles. However, although the game has controller support, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare to play using a controller since so many puzzles are reliant on click-and-drag mechanics that are optimal for a mouse/mousepad. That's the only drawback, otherwise it's a pretty good game and a clear improvement from the first one."

This cute beautiful colourful puzzle platformer is a must have for all casual gamer fans!

A bit of an improvement over the first game; the control system appears to be better.It's quite easy, so probably one for young kids or if you just feel like a bit of a non-challenging game - give it a go :)"

,Not Recommended,444770,33071286,Posted: 30 June,all,Calpis,"I don't really get this game. Surely the visuals are not bad, but neither not something that makes you wow. Maybe it should be marked as game for kids under 7 in the store page...Also I'm not sure what they what to express by having the dog ate a randomly passing by bird, but freed the mice in the lab...yea, let them go, and we can go hunting for meal and testnew medicines on our friends, why not?"

76561198040882512,Recommended,444770,32091075,Posted: 31 May,all,Act,"“Mimpi Dreams” is the super-adorable sequel to the super-adorable Mimpi, which follows the titular pup through their daily fantasies of saving the world as only a good little pooch can. This game felt much more polished than the original, but I also found it to be much easier — I didn’t have to use the hint-bulbs once, and they were thicker on the ground this time. As a result the games progresses more smoothly, but it’s also a little less engaging. I also missed the drawings explaining how Mimpi translated the human world into dog understanding — I wish there’d been more of that. But there was definitely a playability boost given to things, and the damn game is just so adorable."

76561198143401988,Recommended,444770,25486539,"Posted: 12 September, 2016",all,ToonSkribblez,Mimpi Dreams is very cute and creative. The puzzles aren't that challenging but they're still fun to solve. The animation is smooth and the artstyle is very charming. It's a short game that only has five levels as of now but I'm hoping there will be more in the future. I'd recommend Mimpi Dreams if you just wanna spend the afternoon chilling out and playing a nice little game.

,Not Recommended,444770,31564828,Posted: 5 May,all,Garom,"It's a cute little side scrolling jump'n'run with some point&click passages, which does neither have any big challenge, nor a long playtime. I needed only 90minutes to complete all the levels.But the price of 8€ is way to high for the game. So no recommendation from me."
