It can get very difficult and frustrating as it gets faster and there is very little you can do to correct yourself if you go wrong.Levels get progressively harder as you get further into the game (level 7 gave me more trouble than bloodborne. Evil Indie Games is a literal game description btw) with more difficult challenges.  I died so many times on the first area alone, one at 99% complete -_- Music is really great and fits the psychadelic kinda style of the visuals. The story is so weird but interesting too in a way.Will update as I play more but 10/10, would die at 99% area complete again."

76561198248091288,Not Recommended,444800,32309445,Posted: 9 June,all,wierdopi,"This game suffers from endless-runner syndrome. Let me explain. In most endless runners, let's take Subway Surfers as an example, the game is only really satisfying and fun when you've been playing for a couple minutes and already have maybe a hundred thousand points or so. It speeds up gradually, but as it does so, it becomes exponentially more satisfying and easy to die. When you finally do die, you feel disappointed that now you have to spend a few minutes before the game becomes fun again. Robot Unicorn Attack 2 solves this problem by letting you change the speed and acceleration that you run at, but these are both still free games on the app store. Now let's take a look at No Thing.In Subway Surfers and RUA2, there are missions and upgrades, as well as in-game currency to give a sense of character progression. This does not exist in No Thing. I get that when you're going for this whole cyberpunk aesthetic, showing a character model breaks the fourth wall, as would upgrades and missions, but the game just isn't fun. To pass each level, it really isn't clear what you need to do, just play either until you die or until, magically, here's the next level. The music will get stuck in you head, and it's just a one-minute loop, so it becomes really jarring after a while.As soon as you die, the weird robotic narrator talking to you in incomprehensible verses start over again. The same lines end up said over and over, and the gameplay isn't even interesting. It's just turning, that's it. Nothing else. You turn, and there's a bleep. There are floating cubes that don't do anything but change the color of the screen, and oh, have I mentioned the visuals?Sometimes the screen get filled with ""artsy"" glitch-looking things that are like looking through a gummed-up contact lens. And everything is one color. It changes, but not much, and the colors aren't truly bright or varied enough to be interesting.Let's remember, this is a paid game on Steam, not a free iOS game. And it's worse than a lot of free endless runners, even though it's basically a paid endless runner. There's no sense of progression, I'm on the third stage and I still don't even know who I am, who the narrator with the incredibly boring and repetitive voice is, or who the god damn Queen of Ice is. The visuals are a tiny bit interesting, but also jarring, the gameplay is completely uninteresting, literally just turning with a bleep sound effect, the plot is incoherent cyberpunk dystopian garbage, and the music is incredibly repetitive. This game is horrible.P.S. I forgot to mention that very occasionally there are jumps. They are impossible to judge and control.P.P.S. I know that someone must have worked very, very hard on getting the visuals, voiceover/plot and art just right, and maybe I'm just a simpleton who doesn't understand great art. But I do understand game design, and there's no effort put toward making actually satisfying gameplay in that regard. It boggles my mind how anybody could possibly enjoy playing this game for over an hour."
,Recommended,444800,22443681,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Smith,"This is a seemingly very simple game, however I think it goes deeper than that. I actually managed to get past the first two levels and the dialogue was the most interesting thing I have yet to hear. It's like a book that you have to read over and over to really understand the meaning. It's like Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥(perhaps not AS complex) or As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner. At first it seems like it's all nonsense with seemingly poor sentence structure, awkward phrasing but then you realize it's like that for a reason, and since the arcade style game is actually challenging, it forces you to restart and really listen to what it is saying.****-SPOILERS-**** sort of...The game talks about you, a supposed ""simplest office clerk"" and the third level especially talks about people in your ear and it tells you to think two times implying (what I think would be) that you think twice before speaking and that you're supposed to listen to what ""they"" tell you. It does say after all that it is set in a totalitarian regime.It gives off an almost ""what's the point"" sort of feel, as it also talks about you the ""simplest office clerk"" working 8 hours and sleeping 8 hours watching tv for 8 hours and things of those sorts, a routine that is mundane and what seems pointless. You having an office job that you work for 8 hours for, to bring bread to the table, only to be stuck in routine and do nothing in your spare time but something ordinary such as watching TV.Life loses its meaning as it also talks about all those pointless interactions with people you have on a daily basis, one line in the game went along the lines of 'they hear you, but they don't really care about you or what you have to say' because to them you're just another ""simplest office clerk"". Emphasis on ""simplest"". They could have just said ""office clerk"" but no, the simplest was added, and I think that was just to put more emphasis on the whole concept that maybe this really all is pointless, working 8 hours a day, and sleeping 8 hours with people telling you what to do in your ear and you having to think twice about what to say because you're in a totaliatrian regime.ANOTHER line that I really found interesting went along the lines of ""hoping for happiness"" after you do everything that they tell you to do. But I mean really, what happiness can you achieve when all you've done and will ever do is be a simple office clerk. It really (I think) focuses on the mundane aspects of life and puts a big emphasis on the whole ""what's the point ordeal"" and the repeating and following orders like a machine day after day.Play level 3 and you'll get EXACTLY what I'm trying to convey. It's a really fantastic game. It doesn't need to be complex to get its point across, and I love these sorts of games where it really makes you think, yet it's so simple. Like Papers, Please. Maybe I read too much into this, but if you make it to the third level, and really listen to the dialogue, even in level two, you can hopefully see what I'm talking about.Oh, another thing. What helps me pass levels is when you're turning, wait until half of the next platform horizontal to you is past your screen before you press to switch directions. I found it helped me with timing, and gave me a bit of reference as to when to turn.ALL IN ALL, GREAT GAME."
,Recommended,444800,26743645,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,Serotoninphobe (Farewell ¥15),"[Although upvote is given here, it comes purely out of personal aesthetic preference. That is to say, objectively speaking, it should be an irrefutable downvote. Please read it on the premise that this is a NEUTRAL review more from a critical perspective. The reason of writing this relatively long review is that many problems that are commonly seen in indie titles can be identified in this game, which makes it a perfect case study subject.]I have never expected a runner game to be this emotionally evoking.A narrator with synthetic voice apathetically repeats ironically poetic phrases, with retrofuturistic symbols of the 80s overwhelm the screen. Accompanied by 80s cheesy yet catchy synth-pop tracks while playing the role of a “simplest office clerk” in a totalitarian setting. Indeed, this game is literally a visualization of Radiohead’s Fitter Happier. Since Fitter Happier is one of my all-time favorites, I fall in love easily with this game.However - there is always this however - my honeymoon with it ends in less than one hour, ever since the moment all the fascinating voice-over, visual and soundtracks faded away in my senses, leaving nothing but the never-ending path in my tunnel vision; the moment a somehow expressive and sentimental experience took a sudden turn into a tediously hard quicktime reaction and muscle memory grind, where the difficulty does not come from well-designed challenges, but from irresponsibly clumsy mechanics.I will explain the reason of choosing the rather uncommon word “irresponsibly” (in terms of video game review) in following sections. But first to clarify, I beat the game in 4 hours, which is far below the average completion time according to online statistics, to say the least, it proves that difficulty is not the major reason that prevented me from enjoying the game.People tend to use the term “with rough edges” when reviewing indie titles. Like I mentioned in my other reviews, I do also prefer flawed but unique games rather than perfectly polished indistinguishable titles, for flaw and weakness is what really defines one’s personality. However, the roughness of NO THING has way exceeded my tolerance threshold for rough edges, it’s more like a sea urchin whose only smooth spot is hidden deeply underneath.The level design starts reasonable, but gets increasingly random and messy as you progress. First we got this level 7, where you need to run through an extra-long sequence of extra-narrow platforms which are only half the width of normal ones with lighting speed (speed increases every time you take a turn), for 5 laps! More than half of my playtime was spent on this single level. After this cursed level is conquered, we got two of the easiest levels as level 8 and level 9, and the chaos eventually reaches its climax at level 10. It’s as if the developers finally ran out of all patience, and decided to just drop a bunch of platforms randomly into the space, then only made a little effort to get them connected somehow and call it a level. At the second half of level 10, none of the platforms are properly positioned and aligned (in any of the three axis!), which leads to unforeseeable gap or altitude offset everywhere. Since you don’t have the liberty to jump in this game, it means you’ll easily get stuck or launched sky-high at any time. BUT WHY???It results from another disastrous design choice. The developers used Unity’s default physics engine based first person controller in full-scale without any optimization to handle such simple movement mechanism of this game. Player-wise, it means the “simplest office clerk” you control is actually a “capsule shaped rigidbody” which indeed has feet of a hemisphere as the name suggests, thus, thanks to the physics engine, any protrusion on the ground will easily launch you sky-high. Since there are barely any platforms that are seamlessly aligned like aforementioned, you’ll get high all the time, so dope. Now move on to the most ridiculous one, if you fall into one of the larger gaps between platforms, guess what will happen? Falling down? No! you’ll stuck there once the vertical part of your capsule body touches any vertical side of the platform, because of the existence of friction in the physics engine which the developers forgot (or never realized) to disable.The point of listing all those defects in details, is to shed a light on the fact that none of these problems is that technically difficult for a responsible developer to fix. Therefore, all the confusion and misery caused thereby is per se a result of irresponsibility rather than inability. That, is an unforgivable sin of indie developer.Now, let's step back and take a look at the bigger picture, NO THING is just another victim of the haunting dilemma that got tons other indie games as well:unconfident developer got confused by their own creation in the development process and thereby forgot their original intention.The symptoms including but not limited to:Ignorant/Unconfident about the strongest forte of the game (which is the unique aesthetic, in NO THING’s case), so instead of pushing this particular forte to its maximum, they distributed their resource evenly to all aspects. Due to the nature of limited resource as indie developer, most of the time, it ended up evenly mediocre.Keep adding new features they don’t really comprehend of as a last resort to boost gameplay, but none of the newly added features has been properly deepened, as a result, turned the game into a bloated Frankenstein.Such as the speed boosting/decreasing pickup in NO THING, which has been dropped at its most primeval state that is no better than nonexistent due to its extremely limited effect. Only in two scenarios of the entire game I can notice its existence that is level 7 and 9. If ever they could recalculate the extent of its effect and introduce more alternative paths to the level layout, a layer of resource management could be easily added atop the uninspiring routine of its gameplay, a game altering difference could be made thereby.Compromising in every way in attempt to satisfy all groups of player. They’re either too afraid of being criticized by conventional gamers as lacking of engagement and “gameplay” (quote gesture here), thus turned to raise artificial difficulty through brutally messing with parameters and death penalty and stuff. Or going totally opposite, afraid of being too hard or “gamey” for the art lovers, hence essentially making the whole game into a never-ending tutorial or preschool education program.As of NO THING, the inhumanly artificial difficulty is presumably a result of some unilateral playtesting sessions. Nevertheless, it can still be simply corrected by reducing the increment of speed per turn and shorting the length of some levels, but they never give it a second try. Moreover, for whatever reason, the developer didn’t even round up the value of speed to a certain decimal place, leaving the number bouncing left and right on the interface constantly, showing stuff like 2.599999 or just 1.85 … sighThe list can still go on a few more, but the rest is not within the scope of this review, so I’ll just stop it here to conclude this review by answering the question you might be having the whole time: Why give it an upvote since all I do is keep talking about its negatives? The answer lies in the one-of-a-kind memorable experience NO THING provides, especially if you’re into cult classic sort of works, you might even find it enjoyable, but for how long? That’s totally depends on your patience and tolerance level. NO THING is irrefutably a bad game in all standards, however, the irreplaceable temperament it has, in my book, means much more than most good yet replaceable titles out there these days."

And I love it.The game mechanic is as old as the hills - you simply use two buttons to turn left or right (controller shoulder buttons worked nicely for me). Each level ramps up in speed and difficulty. There are automatic jumps at some point, and I am sure other obstacles down the road that I haven't seen yet. Yeah, I think it is fairly difficult, too.So what is novel here?The real interesting part is the dialogue. The story is told as a sort of spoken-word/rap as you navigate through the roads and intersections. It almost has a bit of a beat to it, *almost*. The music and ambience are great too.Look, this is a weird indie title for the sake of being weird - and I love that.Just know what you are getting yourself into. If you want complex and addicting gameplay, I'd probably look elsewhere. If you want a unique experience, and the trailer has you on the fence - go for it!"

Seems a good idea, eh?All you do is push the left and right buttons to turn, and stay on the road. Sounds easier than it actually is.Its levels that are just a bit too long, so I really hate it when I lose near the end of a level, because that means I have to do the exact same thing yet again and hopefully not screw up and the end.Also, the runner doesn't run in exact straight lines parallel to the roads you run on, so if you land too near to the edge of a long stretch, your runner may fall off near the end. You can't really correct your errors - your runner can only turn every so often so for example, you can't turn then turn back again fast enough to move ""slightly to the left"" to correct your errors.The game is irritating like that.Thankfully, as you run, some charming electronic music plays and an electronic voice speaks, and it gives you something to ponder about the world of the game, whoever the voice is, and whoever your character is....actually, I switched the music off after a while, because it get a bit irritating after the first few hundred times because it becomes repetitive and was too chilled out and I wasn't. It's not a fault of the music, but a reaction to it. I put on some faster-paced music and found that I was playing better. Is this cheating?Overall, I recommend this game. It's simple, and it's annoying, but it makes my brain wake up, and despite its flaws, I seem to keep coming back to it."

The gameplay and graphics also heavily complement the story: the colourful overlays switching, changing graphics and tight, difficult gameplay really give the feeling of being lost, confused and tense, matching the story of isolation and alienation. The story is very difficult to follow since if you pay attention to it you'll most likely die. However this again adds to the atmosphere of confusion and alienation. Additionally the difficulty of the game allows the story to be easier to follow: as you play and die (a lot) you hear the same narration again and again, slowly picking it up in an almost subliminal manner which also helps to add to the bizarre, confused sensation the game gives you.Absolutely incredible game, great, tight, difficult gameplay, great simplistic, poppy soundtrack, the graphics, though extremely simple really do an excellent job for the game.

,Recommended,444800,22916687,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,parasight,"NO THING has taught me several life lessons to simplify my ways of living.Some of the most memorable would be that the neighbors are eating dinner, also they happen to be watching TV, and I could not possibly forget the fact that I have also been taught about their relative location, specifically, that they are located behind the walls and doors.Jokes aside, this game is a runner genre game, if that is a genre, never heard about it before I laid eyes on this game, it had me interested in it ever since I saw the cover picture in the store. At first I thought that somebody made a vaporwave meme come to life in the form of a game. I was baffled by the fact that the only gameplay is just switching directions by 90 degrees to the right or left and as I would soon learn, having to go a full 360 degrees to save yourself from the endless void underneath the pathways you navigate that make up the levels. The trailer had me hooked, the game is one of a kind if there aren't any other like it, which had me thinking about spending money on it.So I did.And I got what I wanted.This is as simple as an indie about a simple office clerk gets, don't buy the game if you're not looking for uniqueness, it isn't even expensive, so I wouldn't say it's a waste of money if you don't like the game.Not much to say about the plot as there's not much of a lead to catch onto, but you can make up your own ideas about what's happening in the game. The game has a pretty addicting soundtrack and it blends with the gameplay very well, the increasing speed as you turn makes it even better, in my opinion, all of that makes this game have a good replay value and a drawback effect, I just can't get enough of it. I've also found some exploits (level 3, turn slightly before the turned pathway and get stuck in the corner, press left/right repeatedly for a speed increase and point farming, if you want to place high in the leaderboards) and minor bugs (level 7 had me do some experimenting at the spawn point and I somehow had the character go diagonally, not straight, but this doesn't happen until you die repeatedly and respawn extremely quick, also can make you turn with little delay)The soundtrack is stunningly amazing, can't wait for the DLC, will gladly pay for it, and would be even more glad to do so if the songs weren't simple loops ripped from the game, but I'll be happy with either.I wonder what message the clerk was supposed to deliver though, probably a safety railing suggestion for every pathway."

Your character runs forward non stop and you move them left or right to avoid obstacles and death. I've always had a guilty pleasure for these games as they kill some time and can feel very rewarding when you finish a level after failing at it so many times.This is what NO THING is but has a interesting concept behind it. You play as a office clerk who is delivering messages to people. As you run about the place, a robotic voice talks to you about a lot of different things such as Totalitarianism and Mundanity of everyday life. This is annoying in its own way though as you have to restart the level from the beginning    if you die, meaning you have to listen to the same piece of dialogue over and over again.After a couple of levels, this game does start to become a little bit boring. You end up finishing a level out of determination rather than enjoyment. The graphic glitches and colours that they throw at you can make it hard to concentrate which adds extra challenge but could also cause quite a headache.I would still recommend this game. If it goes on sale for a couple quid, I would pick it up. Its only about 2 - 3 hours of gameplay, depending on how good you are at these type of games, and does try to do something interesting with a simple gameplay mechanic. 7/10.(Note: Great game to play whilst listening to ""OK Computer"")"

More the deeplyimpressedbypureawesomeness-cool that you rarely use for describing something because of its fresh style, feeling or mindchanging character. Let's be honest: Not everything can be cool and not everything cool can be cool for everybody. You need a special kind of taste for visuals and music as well as an eager fighting spirit to be able to enjoy NO THING. Personally I was immediately hooked by watching the trailer that shows what the game is - left and right at the left and right time, pure adrenaline and finest vaporwave art.NO THING will take you on an immersive trip, the synergy of graphics, voice and tunes is exceptional, the gameplay feels super smooth and the addictive restartitoverandoveragain-engine runs with the beginning of the first minute. Did somebody already mention that this game ist hard? Yes, this person was right. NO THING makes no bones about the fact that it is very unforgiving, extremely repetitive and demanding in every aspect (I made it only to Level 4 of 10 so far). If you can deal with that, I can tell you NO THING is a very good small game for a reasonable price.To make it short: If you like the trailer - buy the game. And consider buying the soundtrack as well.8/10"

,Recommended,444800,22365117,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,rarelikeaunicorn,"No Thing is a weird blend of the traditional infinite runner genre, vaporwave aesthetic, the slight nausea of big airtime akin to a surfing mod in an FPS game, and visual disorientation. For a game with only two buttons it is surprisingly deep, both in execution potential and theorycrafting optimal routes; should I take this cube now? Next lap? Never? Players can tailor their choices to match their skill levels and try to complete this surprisingly difficult game.What's also exciting about No Thing is the speedrunning possibilities. Given the technically optional nature of many of the blocks, the varying level completion requirements, and the opportunities to deviate from the intended course, you have a lot of unique ways for players to approach the challenges and try to finish the game as fast as possible. It's also a punishing game for a speedrunner; dying late on a level like 7 or 10 will set you back multiple minutes, meaning that there will be fairly big gaps between runs with 0 deaths and those with even a single death.I would recommend this to most people who enjoy a unique challenge in their games. Level 7, for example, reminded me of the frustration I experienced in trying to complete Veni Vidi Vici in VVVVVV for the first time. The game lacks in depth of gameplay elements so if you're looking for something with a conceptually broad scope then you'd best look elsewhere. Additionally, while streaming the game I had a viewer experience some mild motion sickness. If you're prone to a motion sickness response from games, stay away.Overall, this game is super satisfying and I definitely got more than my money's worth with the cheap price point. I plan to stream more of this game, and now that I've completed a run I'll be attempting speedruns of it as well. I encourage others to challenge themselves to do the same."

All you have to do is reach the end of the level by turning left and right, and after each couple of turns you speed up a littlel. However, as soon as you beat the first level the game opens up and gains verticality. This adds a new layer to the game because, if you time your turns and jumps right, you can actually skip entire parts of a level. Also, levels become far less straight forward, and much more like big mazes for you to run around in, and get confusing with multiple ways for you to go, some of which lead to death. It's a simple, yet fun and challenging experience.Visually the game looks, in the lack of a better word, trippy. Simple polygons with some psychedelic images floating around , with the screen changing color every couple of turns, and sometimes the screen will start looking ""buggy"", making it harder to see the way you're supposed to go.The music is fantastic, I died a few times because I got lost in the music and accidentaly turned to the beat.There is a story. And as the store page says, it is weird. It is presented by short lines a voiceover speaks every once in a while. And it is hard to follow, because if I try to focus on the narration, I usually die. Can't say much about it now.All in all, a very simple, but again, very fun and challenging experience, once you can easily get lost in."

The game gets faster, and most of the challenge comes from muscle memory and timing. Each stage pretty much is 4-5 minutes long, but you'll replay them over and over to learn them without many mistakes. Might seem just artsy, but is actually challenging and fun to master.While the visuals are pretty unique retro-minimalistic and works on its favor, it also works against the gameplay. The game changes color after certain number of inputs, and going from soft colors to suddenly a bright neon red can and will blind you while you try to stay focus. This can be a literal pain since you have to repeat stages until you beat them, leading to your eyes feel like bleeding after long sessions. It surely can be a dangerous game for people with epilepsy. Migraine being a feature sounds to me more like devs knowing about the issue and just roll with it, but i really hope they add an option to tone down the colors or a monochrome mode.I really wanna complete this game and dig out its curious plot.

The narrator talks about isolation and tedium and occasionally gives away bits and pieces about your role in the world.The main sources of difficulty are long levels and the unintuitive camera perspective.
