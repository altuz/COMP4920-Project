Also, achievements are broken, making zero progress towards any achievement. The price point is fair for a game with online multiplayer, though finding a random to play against can be a challenge"
76561197975607244,Recommended,444880,31682147,Posted: 11 May,all,Nomad,"This game is best played with a party of friends. So if you have no friends I would avoid. if you do have friends then read on.The aim of the game for the ""runners"" is to reach the destination by hitting check points on your way to the goal. The aim of the ""shooter"" is to stop them with various weapons depending on the stage. Ammo is replenished by successfully hitting the runners. It is a pretty simple idea with mixed results. if the shooter is not that good the runners have a good chance, if they are good however the dodges at the disposal of the runners aren't up to much.The number of levels is quite low. The music is also pretty much stolen from other games (see videos for more on this). We had fun playing this game and it easily justified it's price (on sale or in bundles). The Steam price seems a bit high for a game like this. Should be a bit lower as standard.I will recommend this, as it is worth it as a party game(assuming you pick it up for a couple of pounds or so.). It does however, have some glaring faults and is far from perfect.The music needs to be more unique. The dodges need to be better or the knock back on certain weapons needs to be nerfed and so on. Hitting your friends with the weapons does give a sadistic glee and betraying other runners gives that same devilish grin. So there is plenty of fun to be had.Here is a couple of videos showing what I mean much better than words can explain. A picture paints a thousand words and all that jazz:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObEaWLuV0vEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l5HArbvWpg"

But was it fun, hell yea. Me and 3 buddies bought it for less than a dollar, and i had a good time playing it. I'd say if you and a couple of friends just wanted a cheap game that you can play for a couple of hours and then forget about it, this is the one to go to."
,Not Recommended,444880,32785965,Posted: 25 June,all,cR11,"Really glitchy and it didn't even work. Me and my friend just bought this in the sale and tried to play online multiplayer, my friend couldn't press the accept button to host an game and when I tried to host they couldn't see my game on the list. Tried inviting through Steam and it just tried launching the game again and brought them to the main menu.Very glitchy and needs work. Maybe it will work in the future."
,Recommended,444880,30670873,Posted: 22 March,all,제이,"I'll get straight to the point and make it clear: the game is far from finished/stabilized. The only reason(s) I upvoted instead of down was because (1) I got it for a 90% discount price and (2) I so wish the game will grow both in terms of quality and user pool. (But I guess improved game quality should naturally lead to increased user pool sooner or later.)Some of the problems/dissatisfactions I experienced so far are as follows:- Some keybinds are incorrect. For example, the default key settings indicate that left mouse click is shoot and right mouse click is charge. However, left click does not trigger shoot and I need press keys 1,2,3 instead and press the E key for zoom.- Not all the maps seem to be available for selection. There seems to be maps that are only playable by chance if you set it to random, and do not appear on manual selections.Conclusion:1) Buy the game ONLY if you have friends that can and will play with you. (There are no hosted rooms if you enter the online mode - literally zero)2) Wait for the game to stabilize or become more packed with content (ex. more maps and modes), or buy it when it's on a huge sale like I did."

,Not Recommended,444880,33573309,Posted: 15 July,all,RockstarCRO,"The concept of Death Stair is an awesome one. This is a phenomenal game if you have friends to play with locally or online. However the further you go into the game, you'll start to notice little hiccups and glitches. Then you'll start realizing the game should have more potential to be awesome, but falls very far from being an outstanding game.Death Stair is a game in which there are four participants. 3 participants will be runners while 1 will be a gunner. The gunners objective is to hold the runners back as far as possible for a set time limit. Runners have to push the gunner back until they reach the final checkpoint before the time limit runs out. The gunners ammo will vary from stage to stage. Some of the ammo included is giant beach balls, brick launching mini-gun, mine deployment and a water cannon. There is one stage in particular where the gunners ammo isn't the most effective - so tough luck if you're a gunner on that level. The levels themselves are very few in numbers, but are fun and challenging. Some levels (especially the ice level) can be quite burdensome and a little too challenging for the runners as there is no ""safe spots"". Some levels will have divets in the walls or the floor for runners to hide from incoming fire. Runners have 4 abilities : run, dodge left, dodge right and jump. Besides that, runners cannot interfere with one another. Overall, thegameplayis alright, but quite stiff in its delivery.Thevisualsare ok at best. The amount of different types of weapons is nice and is satisfying to see a bunch of balls rolling down the stairs knocking players back. The actual hitting effect and ragdoll effects are at best (again) - ok. There is nothing too substantial or fancy when it comes to this domain. The user interface is also a little buggy and wonky. Thesoundsare also at best ok. They are not diverse and quite repetitive, especially after playing a few rounds.Overall, the game is ok and fun if you have people to play with. If you have a friend at your house and two online, you cannot play together... well the local component won't work with the online component. Meaning, unlike Blazerush or other games of the sort you cannot play with local players and play online. Either you play online or you play local - no in between. This was quite a drawback for me. I will not be recommending the game as I don't think its top quality. Sure I bought it on sale for about a buck, but I do not see a lot of people playing this for hours on end - even with friends. If this does appeal to you, I would suggest to have a group of friends who also own the game and to buy it on sale.RATING : 6.0/10GameplayC+Story / CampaignN/AVisuals / User InterfaceCSounds / MusicCReplay-abilityC-OverallC-"

,Not Recommended,444880,29683109,Posted: 3 February,all,eXsT,Game had the cheek to ask me to leave a review so here it is. This game is utter garbage. A 10 year old could code a more stable game. More bugs than the amazon rainforest plus the fact literally 0 people play it. You're money would be better spent on CS:GO Cases as you have a higher chance of getting a knife than enjoying this game.

While it's not without it's issues, I have a strong faith in the dev team to iron out the bugs and leave behind a really well done, polished gem.I've seen game play and have played a little of the game myself, and I'm super excited to play more with my friends at our next game night. I'd definitely recommend this game, especially if you have a few controllers handy!"
