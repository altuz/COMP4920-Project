However, they still didn't add a zoom-out feature, which makes me particularly sad. It's almost impossible to move in any direction without being hit by an enemy due to your lack of sight. Regardless, great game!"
,Recommended,444940,30999943,Posted: 7 April,all,Ricter,"The blade saint returns.Ubermosh: Black may be my favorite of the series.Map still has a defined border and randomly generated land masses that can be used as cover.New AOE attack adds far more dynamic to the game and really gets you feeling like you can overcome large swaths of enemies.Slicing bullets and enemies, while blasting the rest to Hell and back will get your blood pumping.Entire series is worth a purchase. Getting the series on sale is an absolute steal."
,Recommended,444940,25866075,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,Balaam's ass,"First, to those looking at this game and wondering if it's as good as the original UBERMOSH - yes, it is, and yet it's a different game.tldr - Same as the original game, fast-paced, arcade-like, highly decisive game requiring fast thinking and good twitch to glean the Steam achievements (which are DOUBLE the original, at 300 kills per class, and 1 needing 600 kills in 1 game, on any class).The new stuff includes three primary additions to the game:Brainclap - essentially a 360-degree LoS-to-offscreen attack that procs upon reaching a certain number of kills.  This number is slightly different for each class, but from 50 to 60 in all cases.CM Catalyst - Having played the class through several games, I can't find a functional difference between this class and Green (no CM), as they appear to function exactly the same.New advanced/boss alien with a new gun.  Thsi guy is essentially the same as the brownish colored alien with the red gun, but he's a slightly different color and leaves a blue bloodsplat with a different gun - one with a better spread of bullets.  He's my new favorite alien, because I want his gun >:)There's also a slightly different color scheme and, as mentioned, achievements for kills are doubled from the original.  This sounds formidable to the point of impossible, but the addition of Brainclap, which kills enemies as well as clearing bullets, and the new alien means there's better tools to do killing.  Playstyle will be very similar, but getting 300 as Kensai is indeed frustrating for a while; it's just about keeping on your game until your skill carries you through on a game where your luck is high, too.Compared to the first UBER, I give this one similar marks in all categories (soundtrack, intuitive controls, mildly wonky but predictable hitboxes, high replay value), and it's an easy, easy thumbs-up, worth every penny at it's price of $2.99.  If you pick it up this week, go ahead and get the Collection, which is LESS expensive than base price, and includes the first game as well.Very well done, developer Machado - bravo!"

The enemies seem more aggressive, throwing off your timing, and attacking faster than before.  There's less room for error.  The score goals for the various acheievments have increased significantly.    Although I enjoyed the previous Ubermosh, I found it a bit too easy.  I like the challenge with this one...I like how it forces you to maintain your focus in order to survive.  The control feels more loose than the first game, which can be frustrating, as I find myself over-adjusting to enemy fire all too often, and getting myself killed.  I recommend this game for those who want something they can jump into quickly for short bursts of intense action."

The only problem with this game is that it's only fun in short bursts. I know that this is the second game, but an update with some extra stuff would be great. I'd recommend buying the UBERMOSH Collection, since it comes with the original UBERMOSH, the soundtrack, and UBERMOSH:BLACK, and it's only six bucks. People need this game in their life, it's a great time waster."
,Recommended,444940,29617801,Posted: 31 January,all,[ Maxie ],"The second instalment to the UBERMOSH saga was the one that gave us the brainclap, a move that can easily wipe out enemies after you rack up so many kills.What's so good about this game then? IT'S UBERMOSH OF COURSE! Who doesn't want to cut bullets and gun down as many enemies as possible? 90 seconds to cause as much chaos as possible. Bring it on.We're treated to the same heart-pumping soundtrack that made the original so fun, and with a new move and more variety in class mods, what else can you say?Admittedly it is a bit strange going back to BLACK (and to an extent the original) after blasting around in the open arenas in Vol.3 and WRAITH, but it just means that you have to take a different tactical approach. And I like that.If you enjoy arcade style cyberpunk shoot-'em-ups or you're looking for a game you can get a quick rush of high-octane action in, this comes highly recommended. All the games in the series do actually."

Extremely well controlled and fluid combat make it so much fun to play. I think the sword is the weakest part and I had a very difficult time playing with only the sword. It just felt with this close of a camera it was impossible to see what I was running into. Also it felt I should have redirected the bullets back but I took the hit anyway, perhaps a hit box problem.Anyway this is solid and at some point I'm sure I'll pick up the others in the series."

They areveryindie, and have a lot of character.2. They are quite simple games; definately a one-trick-pony as far as mechanics go. No RPG elements or anything like that. The first minute of playtime will be exactly the same as the 30th hour of playtime, except you may be better at it.3. IMO there should only be one game, and not three, but hey they are cheap.4. Your only goal is score-chasing.Yeah, the series is overly simple, but they are fun to play in short bursts and definately have great indie feel."

It's only basically 1 level with some slight random variations, plus a variety of classes to choose from the change the gameplay a bit. The achievements available are listed right on the menu screen to motivate you to open a can of whoop♥♥♥♥♥on the hoards trying to murder you. Seriously, I found them extremely motivating. The soundtrack is worth noting for sure - I don't know how many tracks there are, but the music doesn't get old even after a 2 hour play session. In fact, the music is one of the only things that kept me sane while I was on the  verge of rage-quitting, so there's that.This game is truly bullet hell (veterans of the genre need to try the ""hardboiled"" mode"") but with an interesting game mechanic added that takes the gameplay beyond simply dodging enemy projectiles.All in all, this game is dope. I don't know why I waited so long to buy it. If you are a competitive person who likes to rack up a high score, this game will provide you with several hours of gameplay for a low price.

My review for this will be very similar to my review on the first gamePros:-Gameplay is still smooth and fast, along with different classes which you can select and master to obtain the best score in each class. The new ability called Brainclap which was introduced in this game is a great addition-Visually appealing with it's retro cyberpunk feel to it-Soundtrack is amazing and adds to the atmosphere and pace of the game-Improved AI, making the game even more challenging than its precursor-It has Steam Achievements-It's really cheap at R12 (~$1)Cons:-Can't change the volume in-game, which can be pretty annoying as the game is very loudOverall, this game improves on the previous installment, but still retains the qualities that made UBERMOSH so amazing to play.
