,Recommended,444970,21879077,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,JonnyTenebrous,"TL;DR: Superb sound spacialization through your headphones.  Full home theatre experience, even when your household is asleep.  Responsive devs.  Very inexpensive.  I love it - huge recommend!Update 13/Apr/16:  Now that I've racked up 160+ hours of usage (which will continue to climb for the foreseeable future), I want to add a quick addendum to my full review below to state straightaway that I've found Spatial Sound Card (SSC) to be nothing short of transformative to my audio experience on PC, and I now use it every day in my short list of ""essential"" software, with games, films, and music.  Once properly set up and paired with quality headphones, and while being fed with good quality audio (not all audio sources are made equal!), the three-dimensional soundstage created by SSC is phenomenal (even with stereo sources, it sounds like you are in a balanced studio with freestanding stereo speakers rather than enclosed in your headphones).  Frankly, I was too cautious in my optimism in my initial review, which was only based on ~10 hours of use.  In addition, the development team has proven to be responsive, communicative, and willing to incorporate user feedback into their updates.  My main criticism, lack of proper documentation, should be resolved any day now according to the devs.  At this price, it's an absolute no-brainer - pick it up and try it out.  The best surround video game audio I've experienced so far with SSC is Mad Max in 5.1 surround mode, with the SSC ""Shanghai"" studio preset and the LFE (low frequency effects) turned down a bit to eliminate distortion (depends on your headphones)... the roaring V8 car battles and getting caught in a raging sandstorm make me reminisce of the first time I ever experienced a cranked up 5.1 Dolby loudspeaker system many years ago.  The fact that I can experience this late at night with my wife sleeping undisturbed mere feet away makes me very happy indeed. :)---------------------Original Review:Warning: Your Mileage May Vary.  My results, though, were impressive!I  can see why, at this point, there are a number of negative reviews.  It's not at all apparent how to set it up properly, I can't find any documentation whatsoever, the various presets give no description as to what they actually do, there are no test sounds built into the program to identify how your settings affect the output and, finally, I imagine the end result may highly depend on your headphones.  I really hope the devs correct these aspects, because many users will understandably become lost and go for a refund.  But then they'd miss out on what this software can do, and that'd be a shame, because this is a unique little gem.So I opened with the negatives, but what about the positives, which I feel won out?  Well, I've persisted with this software past the point of no refunds, and I've finally gotten it setup properly (I think), and the net result is that *the soundscape being played through my headphones sounds much more 3-dimensional than it did without this software*.  In fact, my headphones sound more ""surround"" than they've ever done (in 16 years!), apart from when listening to binaural recordings.  In the end, it actually does what it says on the tin, provided you can get it working.First, my hardware setup is almost custom-tailored for good results with this program.  My headphones are a very loved set of Sennheiser HD600s paired with a small Headroom headphone amplifier plugged directly into the ""Line Out"" (not headphone jack!) of my (meh) Realtek onboard soundcard (Windows 7 64 OS).  Straight away, I experienced the ""garbled sound"" effect that many have complained of.  On my system, as with most I assume, I had to manually select my audio output device and make sure it was in WASAPI mode.  If you don't know your WASAPI from your ASIO, then maybe you didn't take audio engineering courses in university like I did... and that's why some documentation would be useful!  Anyhow... this fixed my garbled sound issue.  Next, I chose a preset... I have no idea what the difference between the different ""city"" themes are yet, but I've settled on ""Dubai"" for the present, chose the EQ preset for Sennheiser HD600s (very handy if you have a pair of the headphones with built-in eq presets), and then lowered the LFE (low frequency effects) knob by a fair bit (numeric values would be more useful than a knob) because the default LFE was creating audio distortion in my headphone amp.I've tried two games with excellent surround sound to properly test everything: Portal 2 and Alien: Isolation.  And the litmus test was that I could walk into an area with a clear directional sound source, close my eyes, and tell more-or-less exactly where it was at as I walked around in-game.  It was much better than the built-in positional audio from the standard ""headphones"" audio settings of the games.  And in the end, that's what counts.Also, I spent ~£5 for this software on sale, so I think it's important to maintain a little perspective.  I'm definitely going to get my fiver's worth out of it.  Heck, I'd pay that just to experiment with this software and encourage developers in trying to make cool audio tech.  This wasn't a snap to setup and use, and I doubt it'd be all that great with poor headphones, so you'll have to weigh your own circumstances up when considering the purchase: do you have good headphones, and are you willing to tweak and experiment to dial in your settings?  If so, I reckon this gives pretty impressive results."
,Recommended,444970,25391846,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,「Ｓｃｈｗｉｐｓｙ」,"This software is odd. It could be the best virtual surround software you ever used but you could use it for a couple of hours and ask for a refund and I'll tell you why.The good StuffIt's 10 bucks and not a lot for this kind of software.It creates awesome sound and a really cool atmosphere when you play.It works for hearing and detecting enemies in FPSs.It also works for scaring your♥♥♥♥♥♥out when you play horror games.Basically, cheap & inmersive.The Bad StuffIt does this weird pops when you use it. You kinda get used to it but they're still annoying.This is thebiggest flaw,it consumes a lot of CPU power. If you're a budget gamer like me, you're probably struggling to get a good framerate when you play and I can't play new videogames with this software. I tried playing GTA V, Rise Of The Tomb Raider, Dying Light and some other games and they all didn't work properly, when it got to CPU intensive on the game and I pressed something on my keyboard or controller, it would have a really bad latency in its response. It uses about 15-25% of my CPU power and it completely bottlenecks it.So, if you got a good PC and want to get some good sound, get this software BUT if you got a budget or just bad PC and you don't want to watch 5.1 movies on it, don't."
,Recommended,444970,22084370,"Posted: 27 March, 2016",all,<RaCo> e Rac,"If you have good sources, this software is nothing short of incredible. It takes surround input and gives you realistic headphone stereo.This isn't like the other headphone-surround tools I have used (Razer, etc), which produce an overly clinical sound. SSC uses room virtualization to make the sound echo from one speaker around the room, which takes the realism to a much higher level.I have primarily tested this with Rainbow Six Siege and Mad Max. In R6 this has allowed me to quite accurately kill people through walls based on sound positioning. That is how good this really is.SSC does have some technical issues for me, namely the sound 'popping.' This gets less significant over time, but it sounds really bad when testing immediatly after launching the program. In the five minutes it takes to actually get ingame the pops generally recede to an ignorable level."
,Recommended,444970,21886590,"Posted: 17 March, 2016",all,✯ ⓁⓊⒾⒼⒾ ✯,"Price is right.If you are receiving stuttering in the sound as you first start it, you need to configure your audio device settings correct. You need to make sure you are using WASAPI instead of ASIO, if I am not entirely mistaken. Also I had to configure my headphones from playback devices to use 7.1 audio instead of stereo. (Here audio experts see I have no idea what I am talking about).Any how, I hate tinkering with equalizer when it comes to finding the right one for games, I use it for CS GO and found that SHANGHAI setting with little tinkering to Steelseries, Siberia ELite prism equalizer worked for me. I lowered slightly the lower and higher end knobs and increased slighty the 125, 250 and 500 values.I suppose I would include more documentation to the settings, but otherwise it's a small money for nice program."
,Not Recommended,444970,33399735,Posted: 9 July,all,Voodooman,"Windows 10 creator update - this software does not work at all! I can see in monitor of sound devices that virtual sound card produces sounds, but i fails to re-route it to actual sound device. Razer Surround and Creative  Blaster X Acoustic Engine can do that without problems. Another problem if you have non english names for sound devices this poorly coded software would not even display or allow to select it, until you rename it to something 100% latin.One more problem - not like most of software on steam it cant start without steam, so you are always going to be ""in a game"" while you run this, and this thing will prevent steam from shut down and will prevent pc from sleep.Software UI is very limited and poor on options, it just has very few presets you cant teven properly set up (except for delays), you can even configure EQ and calibrate positioning of virtual speakers (i mean you cant drag an reposition virtual speakers which is THE MUST core option for any sofware that emulates surround speakers) for your headset, you can only choose from predefined settings for most popular (as they think) phones and thats it. Even freeware version of Razer Surround was not that limited as this PAID piece of crapware.Comparing to OVERPRICED pro version they sell on their site for, which has required options THAT SHOULD BE IN ANY PAID VERSION (like calibration of position of speakers around head), this version feels like TRIAL or DEMO that should be available for free... and they dare to sell this limited demo version for money.Support is non existent. Usually you get respond in less than a day, i left my complains about broken state of software more then 12 hours ago and i still have no reply.This is all sounds great on paper, but on practice it does not even work.I tried it with Xbox One Controller headset both via usb cable and wirless, wtih TV connected via HDMI and with Creative H7 headset connected to Xbox One Controlled via jack and connected directly to USB - no luck, no sound.And surely there is no TV mode available, so if you dont like to sit in heaphones that squeeze your head until you start to feel the pain, you are out of luck - software is not calibrated to provide spatial sound from stereo speakers of TV, which is shame. They position software as suitable for movies - but who watches movies with headset? You connect pc to tv and watch movies with friends or family with stereo sound (until you have some rare tvs that has built int spatial surround emulation or use some sound bars that emulate 5.1-7.1 sound, like Creative Katana) of TVs speakers, or rarely from surround speakers (by the way i do have them, but im tired of many wires on my floor and decided to go spatial direction). This sofware is not suitable for movies while it only supports headsets.Going to ask steam support for REFUND. Maybe ill try it later when devs will unbroke this broken mess and will add required configuration options and tv mode."

I use it pretty much every day and every time i start up my computer. Lets get some of the positives down first.Its 10 dollarsIts better than onboard sound for im guessing any motherboard.It works well with my logitech Z 506 setup.It plays sound through my dedicated sound card which im not sure how but i dont need to plug anything into the onboard ports.It has a lot of options.It does an amazing job of giving you a sound stage you can use in either gaming or just listening to music.You can set for stereo, 5.1, 6.1 or 7.1 surround sound.You have many headphones to choose from even if you dont have them you can use their sound stage. The short medium and long section is a little strange but it sets the general punchyness of the sound. So with low its more flat and with long its more drawn out in the sound. (best way i can describe it)The sound stages are awesome and give you a good feel of where everything is when gaming.On to two negatives so far. 1 There is no start up when computer starts up option because you have to start it up through steam. I would love to get a free upgrade where i can have it as a program that does the exact same thing but can set to start up when my computer starts up. Not a huge problem i am just saying it would be nice to have.Second negative is that its always on top when you open it. So if you have steam open and you have the program open its gonna be over steam and may block some stuff so make sure to minimize it.Those are just some small things that arent a big deal but i figure they are worth mentioning. I really really enjoy using this product and I look forward to playing more of the games i have in the future. It works really well with FPS games where the sound is always changing or if you have games with lots of explosions. BF1, COD (which i dont play), CSS, CSGO (which i dont play). I have over 400 games so i cant list all of them that this product is awesome with but it works well with music or gaming.  Thanks for reading."

I own a 24bit Soundblaster Audigy 2z Platnium Pro that I have used with the system and it did virtualize dulby and THQ 5.1 into headphones but this motherboard never gave me the option to virtualize channels into stereo. Ever... The ""standard 8 channel"" integrated MBO soundcard was unable to function with this software.My F2A68HM-HD2 motherboard already has the Realtek HD audio manager.

I got used to how music was so much better with it, though I only have stereo mp3 and FLAC; I can only say that I like what I hear so I ended up purchasing it when summer sale came.The software does not upmix stereo sounds into 5.1 or 7.1. If you want to use surround sound settings on a game/movie/music, you should see to it that the source's sound output is set to 5.1 or 7.1. I've been using SSC to output Dota 2 virtual 5.1  surround sound for my stereo headphones for some time now and the difference is really noticeable. I've also tried it for movies with 3F2R/LFE(5.1) audio channel; I've mostly experimented with isolating L R C LFE LS RS speaker sounds and can confirm that it works.I've encountered some issue while gaming and using it along with a VoIP service(discord) but they do have a solution for it in the community hub.

I thought this would be good to use with my old PS3 wireless stereo headset and DK2 to have live surround sound and I was right.  Even if you are using headphones make sure to set your speakers in windows audio settings to 5.1 or 7.1 and then match that setting  in this software.  Your actual source audio HAS to be discrete multichannel for this to work.   If you set it for 5.1 and only have a two channel source you will only hear stereo.  The easiest test I found to use was the razer surround software which does something similar but more basic but does provide a game audio loop for you to enable and disable to hear the difference of their method but it also works great to use it for this.  I think they are going to put a demo sound track in it eventually to help people hear the differences without needing to look anywhere else.

I had a bit of trouble trying to figure out what to use it on- finally settled on Bioshock Infinite- and let me tell you- playing it without and with, is night and day! Have the SSC set to 7.1 Shanghai Beyerdynamic DT 770M, and it just envelopes you in the surroundings- every scream, gunshot, broadcast- even the wind, you are totally aware of it suddenly. Glad I was convinced to give this another try :)For those of you having problems with still distorted audio and the like- ensure you're playing music, or software with high enough fidelity. I usually import my music at 320K and iTunes automatically splits it into stereo- this becomes obvious upon playback when using this software, as the software is stripping the stereo channels into separate channels, and it doesn't sound very good- not the software's fault- just something to keep in mind-GIGO (Garbage-In-Garbage-Out).tldr; I would complately recommend this software now- seems like most kinks are worked out, and it's a good deal for more immersive gaming._____________________________________________________________________________________________Update (A week later):I have received no reply from dev either from this review, or from the discussion page as dev had requested. I am requesting a refund. A word of advice, until issues are fixed and or dev starts fixing the problems, I would recommend holding off on this.Original:Sorry, I also cannot get this APP to work, even after I read that the dev had released an update to bind to WASAPI, but I figured I'd give it a try. I could also not get this to work after I installed the trial version directly from New Audio Technology, but I figured I'd give this version a shot- especially with the dev saying he updated it.Problems (If you care to read):Cannot get sound to output through headphones using software as default playback device- unless I run the software in stereo mode (which kinda' defeats the purpose I must admit). The only way I'd been able to get the software to work otherwise is to go into recording devices, and set my headphones to ""listen"" to this recording device on playthrough... this also defeats the purpose, as it does not allow controlling of sound directions- it just patches through.For reference I'm running Windows 10- using Steelseries Siberia V2 headset (USB). I watched some Youtube Videos on this software, and the demonstrations are incredible! I'm sure if this software would work properly it would be amazing. Dev- you seem great like you're working on stuff, I'm willing to try anything if you have any ideas- I tried looking up my problems online and couldn't seem to find anything. I'll certainly update my review if any fixes are made."

I couldn't believe what i was hearing.Everything sounded so rich and so clear, all with great 3d sound. I could exactly locate players in action.The Spatial Sound Card is an absolute must-have for gamers, but also for movie- and music freaks."

76561198105195690,Recommended,444970,29542639,Posted: 28 January,all,liss_918,"Pros:Produces even better virtual surround sound than Raser Synapse program and much more configurable.Imho still not as good as Dolby Headphone technology (with can be found in Corsair Void headphones, most ASUS sound cards and other devices).Cons:Consumes WAY much more CPU resources than Raser Synapse (10% of my Intel i5 2500K) which can be critical during gaming if CPU is your system's bottleneck .Overall:With such a low price, VERY good surround effect and great number of adjustable parameters (much more than any similar solution I know has - actually most of them have just only one on/off button) this is definitely WIN.P.S.I think technollogy like this shoud become a part of operating systems. Go go developers =]"
