Nothing more, nothing less.Soundtrack is generic elevator music, but it does fit the mood and doesn't get old.There's something about this game that is really satisfying, every time you eat something you get a nice little sound effect and see the grey blob grow a little. These small details add so much to the feel of the game and make it extremely comfortable to play.The price really isn't too bad considering a slightly inferior version of the game is (was?) being sold online for a few bucks more.All in all I would recommend this game to people who grew up playing flash games online and want to experience the rush of completing level after level again."

With the addition of 1080p (or maybe higher) resolutions and the two player version. This is now a much better title.In my opinion, the game is also safe for kids since it doesn't have violence in it. Yeah, you're swallowing cats and mice but it doesn't actually depict any violence, they just go poof.I'd recommend this title even if it didn't have a discount. It's a simple game and has a simple soundtrack and simple sounds but it's really fun to just absorb everything and get bigger and bigger.Definitely worth a try, if you're not sure about buying this game, there are free flash game versions out there that you can try (those aren't as polished as this one, but they have the same mechanic)."

You'll have to get lucky or plan an elaborate path to get those medals.Other than that really it's what it looks and sounds like.It's like Agar.io but actually well made and not contaminated with Memes.It's like Katamari games but 2D and with a topdown view, and you don't really roll around.Some levels can even be compared to the Cell phase in Spore!It's very solid, very nice, there's.. some variety.

It will always hold a special place in my heart.It's a rather simple and short game (about 3 hours for the story). The local multiplayer works well and fits the type of game that it is.I'd suggest this game to anyone and everyone that asks about it. It's being sold for $5.99 but I'd still be willing to pay $10 or $15 for the game (though that might be due to the nostalgia).

However, the game looks good, sounds nice and is enjoyable. Some levels are set up like mazes or have predators that reduce your size when you don't avoid them. Each level has bronze/silver/gold time rating but lets you move forward regardless of your time which is perfect for younger kids. I plan to try out the co-op next time my nephews stop by.   The $6 price tag could be considered steep and yet without a shop that requires pay to progress tactics like many of this genre it is a more like a one-time fee to play without built in road blocks.Perfect for those with kids, quick/short gaming breaks and while you watch a movie.

By the time I was halfway through I was getting bored.You start tiny, eat things, get bigger. The ""last level"" took about 20 minutes to complete, and was the longest level by far. In this level you start bacteria sized and work your way up to galaxy/universal size, in my opinion this one long level would be the best way to enjoy the game, instead of having a dozen levels where you begin grape sized and keep going until you are eating houses then stop.But it if it is cheap and you have nothing better to do, but there are better games."
,Not Recommended,445110,22271171,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,Little Puffski,"Note: This is a mixed review, I'm explaining below, but I've decided to give thumb down rather than thumb up. Steam didn't properly count that I've played most of the game in offline mode, I should have over 6 hours of gameplay.It was a pleasant surprise to find out that a game which I've remember playing such a long time ago (and one of the few digital games I've ever purchased) is now on steam. However, there was more than one Tasty Planet game and sadly, this isn't the best one in my opinion.GameplayAs you can tell, you control a blob which consumes anything of a smaller size which helps it grow to eat bigger things, until it consumes the whole universe. The game is a decent casual fun, it's relaxing, all you need is your right hand (I'm not going there) and you're set, but if you want a challenge, going for gold medals or playing the bonus levels is a way to go too. Eating things is fairly enjoyable when levels are nicely composed, and it's always satisfying to get a revenge on a previously larger predators that were threatening you.Some of the levels are nicely paced and varied, but ultimately, most of the are the same, and the game can get stale really quickly. There just isn't enough varienty in terms of levels, sometimes you encounter something more than just level where you continuously eat things around you to get bigger, something that requires a little bit more effort, but those levels are few and far between. Which is where we're getting straight into a value, because everything else regarding presentation is sufficient enough.ValueDespite having a decent time with it, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it - the problem lies within the fact that this game is a remake/sequel of original Tasty Planet, and not a very good one at that. I'm not recommending it simply because there is a better game that has not been ported to steam.While my memory is a little hazy, since it has been years, original utilized the plot better into each level - the ""story"" isn't really important, the original did much better job putting you on a journey to eat the whole planet, while in Back for Seconds you often feel like you're just jumping around doing random stuff like eating cats and dogs. I also don't rememeber too much copy-pasted levels from original, which this game often does - after each episode, it has a tendency to throw all the levels you just went through into one final, which usually doesn't offer anything else other than let's say 5 levels placed into one gigantic level. Last level of this game is everything you've encountered from the very beginning until the end, and the level lasts over 20 minutes, while regular time of a single level is usually around 5 minutes. It's actually fairly annoying for a last level.There are plenty of bonus levels, but they feel even cheaper and sub par to some of the more uninspired ones from the campaign, and they've obviously not placed into any kind of theme, just random stuff that's without a doubt more challenging, but that's not really what I'm looking for in a casual game.Back to the original. It looked better - it had more hand-drawn look to it, which this one doesn't, and some of the things/enemies look downright appaling, or lazy. As for the pacing and gameplay value, the original had more shorter levels with far more varienty, and also one thing that helped out with a challenge a bit more, you could die from one hit from some of the enemies. Here, when levels can sometimes take 10 minutes, it's obviously not possible, the variety is questionable (there is one level where for most of the time you eat red stars, that's it, they don't even change colors).ConclusionIn the end, you have a game that looks OK, the music is kind-of elevator music kind, which is fine (and I think all the tracks are taken from the original game), level varienty is lacking, they get repetitive and sometimes literally get repeated, and they aren't that many. And unlike the first game, the only challenge here is to get medals - if you play the game, you can't really lose, unless you will purposely try. You will never repeat a level because you've failed and you want to overcome the challenge it poses, that will only come to play if you're trying to beat it in a certain time - that's it, there are no levels that would be even remotely challenging on their own.So I'm not recommending this game not because it's bad, but because it's not as good as the other one. The original is currently only available from Dingo Games homepage for the same price (although it says 20 dollars, in the actual order form the price is 6 dollars just like on steam), and I would suggest buing Back for seconds only if you've played the original and want more."

Not recommended for ANY price.The longer version:Okay, I liked Spore. I liked the ConSumo minigame in Bully. A game where you have to gather 'food' in order to 'grow' to advance can be fun, especially if there's some skill needed and you have additional benefits/hazards on advancing like evolving and encountering harder enemies.And then there is Tasty Planet. Yes, the devs have taken the time to fit a comic-book style of storytelling inbetween levels, one mark in their favor, but that does not make a game. Let alone a good one. Essentially, every level has your blob of grey goo (nanomachine colony) either following the mouse, or going to a clicked-on spot. Anything smaller than you is absorbed (randomly accompanied by 'yum'-sounds and the like, eerily reminiscent of the old recorded voice-works in fairytale themepark De Efteling. Anything larger might be harmful to you. The more you absorb, the larger the objects you can consume.Sounds fun? Trust me, it isn't. Every level your size is reset randomly. Grow to over a meter? Reset to a milimeter. Resources are scattered randomly and the locator arrow is mostly useless, making it nigh impossible to meet the time-limits for the bronze, silver and golden medals. Not that it matters, you just have to absorb enough things to fill the growthgauge in order to unlock the next level. By all means, look at my playtime. I've played through a third of all standard levels in that and was bored to tears by then.Not even the resources make up for it. Let's face it, aside from the M&M's clones the sheer volume of them is implausible and variety is simply lacking. Yes, each set of levels has a theme of sorts: labs, dino's, egypt... blah blah blah. Thing is, you have to gulp down a ton of stuff too small for you on average before you can absorb something your size or marginally larger. Perspective jumps are also quite random. The worst though is that the devs did not bother with much historical or paleontological accuracy, nor with creativity in displaying actual differences between consumables.So, is this game worth €5,99? Ahaha, NOPE. This time-waster doesn't register as a game with me, nor should it with you. Get a proper game and send this unabashed piece of garbage back to NewGrounds."

I can't stress this enough, the game has a grand total of about 4 or 5 different music tracks, and a lot of them are royalty free music you can find with a quick google search. (featuring that one kevin macleode track that Vanoss uses in all his videos) But this problem overall can be fixed by muting the music and opening your own.that's about it."

I got a couple hours of fun out of it... well... more like about an hour to an hour and a half of fun, and then impatiently going through the levels to see how the ending is, hoping it'd be what I wanted in the first place. To go from microscopic to astronomical. That's what I wanted at the beginning, but I had to go through ALL those levels to get it. Yeah it was genuinely fun at the start, found it funny that the cats had individual names, the small amount of dialogue is funny at times, the music is charming, and it was kind of fun learning about the different historical items. Now I know that the Wakizashi is between the Tanto and Katana. In the end however, it felt stretched out, the monotonous gameplay stretched on for quite some time, and it felt like the little jokes were getting fewer and farther between.The end did pay off a bit, but I'd have preferred it if I didn't have to go through all those levels just to get the final level, which is what I was looking forward to in the first place. It's only been 2 or 3 hours worth of gameplay, but I'm so tired of its monotony that I finished about 3 of the bonus levels, and I have NOOOO interest whatsoever in grinding my way to getting more medals just to play more. If you've got a few dollars, pounds, Euros, yen, or what have you lying around, and you enjoy games like the fish one where you go from really small to really big by eating other creatures/objects, then this one will sate you for a while. I think it could afford to be a little cheaper, but it's still less than $10 Canadian so I won't complain. I have no regret in having bought it, but I don't see the replay value, and thus the vast majority of the bonus levels will forever remain unplayed because I REALLY don't want to play the main storyline more than once.Well, that's that. I did find that one bonus level with the drawings made in candy to be quite nice. In the credits, just about all of them have the same last name, so it seems to be a family enterprise. Oh yeah, and I couldn't help but notice the Mounties which look quite Canadian, then there's maple leaves in many of the levels. With a name like Dingo Games, you'd think they'd be Aussie... ah, I just looked it up. They're from Vancouver, British Columbia, which is of course in Canada. That explains it. Very cool, didn't know I was playing a Canadian made game. If it were $10 or more, I'd probably call it a rip off, I think $5 Canadian dollars is more this game's speed rather than $8, but 3 bucks isn't exactly something worth getting in a tiff over. Before, I didn't regret buying the game, but now, I think I'm actually glad I did; supports a Canadian game developer. Keep at it, eh!"

I did it in  parts, and it took me several days to complete. All the levels are gorgeous, although a few of them (mainly racing against certain creatures to eat all the things before they did, or you'd have to start over) annoyed the hell out of me.

It's a basic ""eat everything"" game that you see everywhere but it follows the ""katamari"" game style which is the main reason i love this game. It had its crazy moments but they were not too hard to get past (besides the cow level) and it only took ~4 hours to beat the single player mode if you do not strive to get gold on everything. All around i would give it a 5/5 for music, good gameplay, and fun characters aka the scientests. The ONLY issue that i see with the game is the really bad pun at the end with the largest object in the game, I will not give anything away but it made me cringe remembering the movie that it was based on and I am sure that everyone that knows what I am talking about will agree with this.
