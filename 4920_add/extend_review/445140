The sounds the zombies make is as corny as it gets, the animations are lazy and repetitive, and there is no part of killing them that brings any satisfaction.I found reaching behind my head to switch weapons to be super annoying if I want to cycle the other direction (from machine gun to pistol) I have to reach back to get through all the weapons I don't want first, which is costly when there are zombies right in your face.I would've like to see a little more focus put on designing more realistic enemies, more satisfying shooting/head shots, and more weapons.I got my money back."

The £5 mark is what this game should be, this price you might aswell buy brook haven experience which is the best zombie game, i no people will probably say hordz but hordz is a terrible game.  the pistol on it is probably the only weapon you can actually hit stuff with, the sword is just terrible and the machine guns not far off. good reload system but thats about it still to much for me tho so Refund time!"

Do not know if this is fixed as I did not get that far since the recent update due to the frustrations below...Now when picking up gun clips they seem to not register as picked up most of the time... either that or the gun has a problem reloading as I will pick up, say, 5 clips and then the gun will load 1 clip but when that's out will not reload until more found later.Not being able to walk up some corridors is frustrating as the enemy is coming for you but you cannot go up to them so enemies that shoot will be able to hit you, but with the gun glitch (no clips) leaving you with just the swords you have to hide until they come out of the corridor.Enemy gets stuck behind walls but can still shoot fireballs etc at you.Halfway through the level the gun has a big white square every time you shoot now so you can not see what is happening while shooting.I'm sure all this will be fixed in later updates, but can not recommend at this price for now :-("

Prior to that I hadn't really known much about the game. I do remember seeing it when it first released and skipping it as the videos didn't sell me on the title for the price.The game itself surprised me a bit though and I actually enjoyed my play through. The game seems to take inspiration from both survival horror giants, Resident Evil and Silent Hill.I'm not very prone to jump scares but this game has quite a few for the unsuspecting victim. Grab a friend, sibling, SO and stick the headset on them and power this on. Sit back and enjoy the screams... }:)Gameplay 7/10 (It was fun but there were some frustrations.)VR Graphics 7/10 (They're nothing special but they do work for the title.)Audio 7/10 (Had some good creepy moments but some of the death sounds didn't do it for me.)Creepy factor 8/10 (It had it's moments but I'm hard to scare)Locomotion 6/10Point and click teleport with invisible walls.No options to use another form of locomotion.A bit quirky at times.It's not going to blow your mind but it's definitely worth picking up while it's on sale."

But I can tell you this...so far...it's the scariest thing I've ever experienced let alone in VR! It literally had me shaking.If you are looking at this game because you want a fully fleshed out and well designed story driven horror game than stop here.If you are looking to have the living sh** scared out of you due to seemingly random but probably not random spawns, in the eeriest environment you've ever been in using 2 pistols and 2 kitanas than look no further.I bought this game to be scared, and my god it delivered.Don't get me wrong, it's generally not a well polished game. The swordplay is particularly bad but effective at least. As to why this game scared me so much, I have no idea. It's just dark. Eerie. There is really messed up random enemies that spawn from nowhere, and I have an active imagination. Get it while it's on sale.If you're a hard a** who laughs in the face of danger, than this probably won't scare you. But if floating shrieking long-haired severed heads floating at you down a dark hallway makes you feel uneasy, than you're in the right place.https://youtu.be/kyn_eD8jLis"

The atmosphere is spot on and very spooky, there was one room i went in to and didnt want to leave as i finally felt safe.To the Dev's: Enemy SFX need adjusting, the big guys sound like a girl when they die and the dogs sound like a person. Only other fault is when i picked up ammo i lose both weapons from my hands and this can be a pain if a enemy is close and i have to quickly get my gun again. Would be nice to just cycle the weapon via the touch-pad.As its on sale its an easy 7.5/10 and worth picking up for any horror fan."

The game has a lot of great ideas but all those ideas shouldn't necessarily fit into one game or at least the same level.  WIth that being said, the game is decent at this point with the dev making changes and updates regularly.It also sales itself as a horror game which is kind of true.  However, the atmosphere and all the different variety of monsters constantly running toward you make it feel more like a carnival fun house experience.  There are some jump scares but other than that it is not scary at all.  The game also still has a lot of bugs but considering the dev is active it's not much of an issue.  There are many areas of the room that are unfinished and you can see around the walls to the outside.This is one of those games that needs something other than a thumbs up or down button.Overall, the game is enjoyable but just still needs a lot of work.  Because I enjoyed it, I will give it a thumbs up."

,Recommended,445140,25497297,"Posted: 13 September, 2016",all,vinny5023,"This game has very high potential to be an excellent Horror VR Title.  It really made me jump in several areas and felt like I was in a haunted house shooting ride.  The grotesque enemies are nice and varied, they do need work animation wise, they are somewhat stiff.  The weapons dissapear when I enter a new room and the doors need some work.  The level design is pretty awesome and the sounds that surround me keep me interested and immersed.  I would say add an intro where we start outside and then work our way into the mansion, maybe give us a reason for why we are here.  Also add maybe a brighter softer gun light/laser that we can actually see easily to do headshots.  Different weapons would be cool too maybe a semi automatic?  Overall though I see this game going places if they really fix the bugs and keep us immersed in this scary ridelike atomosphere."

,Not Recommended,445140,25548203,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,Killer_Nads,"Thanks for the sale devs otherwise i wouldnt have probably tried this. At the sale price it is definetly worth it. However, i can not recommend this game, at its current stage. It just has too many bugs and problems which are very frustrating.For example, when you go to pick up ammo or open door/drawer your guns change to hands, and then there is no way to change them back again until you do the weapon swap by moving your hand to the back of your neck and first changing to sword and then doing the same thing again to change to the gun. Its really incovenient and annoying.There also just too many bugs, enemies appear out of knowhere, sometimes when you go into a room, and you hear the enemies out side in the hallway they will just suddenly appear through the door and inside the room with you, sometimes right next to you.The boss monsters are a whole other story and animations on them are absolutely horrible, they dont even react to your gunshots at times and they just wonder about aimlessly.This is also not a game where you would want to use teleporting for locotion, it just doesnt work and you loose the immersion everytime. Instead of teleporting please give us other options for walking, like other newer games have, for example using the trackpad to walk, and also swinging our arms to walk works wonderfully in other games i have tried and doesnt make you motion sick either.The game is a great effort by the devs still and it is definetly spooky! No doubt about the scare factor in this game but some of those scare is very cheap especially when the enemies suddenly appear out of knowhere. A great sense of danger also is because when ever your moving forward in the level, enemies can appear from any direction, even the places behind you which youve already cleared, so you never feel safe.Great try devs and i hope you can continue improving the mechanics and enemy AI to make this game alot better. A thumbs down for now as i wouldnt recommend the game in its current state, but i have a high feeling that it will be definetly changing to a recommendation soon with further imrpovements to the game."

The enemies are a mish-mass of zombies, ice creature...things and spiders etc etc. No real artistic style to any of the enemies. The actual level itself is quite nicely done and fairly varied while interesting as well. Yet the odd choice of ""automatic hands"" when near a door handle or item pickup is incredibly awkward to deal with in fights. The AI in these fights is also awkward, clumbsy and terribly animated making them more hilarious than actually scary or a real threat. The fact that 90% of these creatures have no footstep sounds leads to many a cheap attack. The swords are far too brightly aniimated making them more lightsabers than swords, they're also basically useless to use. No feedback to hits, enemies simply walk through and attack you.All in all, I didn't enjoy anything beyond how hilariously bad some of it was. Like a bad B movie that's so bad it's kinda good..."

The game has potential.So I bought this title because the dev put it up on discount for more feedback. I played through the mansion level which will be viewable below. The game is not perfect but it is not bad either. To clarify: At the discount price the game is good and worth it I think. At the regular price the game needs improvement and much more content as the dev stated. At the discount price the mansion level is a good run through. There were some negative things that I will address in the discussions but overall if you buy it now at the discount you probably will be ok with it and have some undead killing and scary fun. To be honest the dev should just sell each level/episode at the discount price to ensure that all the levels are done well. I think sales would be much greater in the long run but trying to get almost $20 now for this is not warrented. And then asking for $24 dollars for now and future stuff is not really anymore enticing. If you like scare games or get scared easily this will give you some. If you like shooting undead this will give some satisfaction. After the game is tweaked some more the game as it stands now will be fine.Added note: The video longer below was brightened up a little. The game is very dark but you do have flashlights on the pistols. Also, I like exploring in my games so the first video is a little longer than planned but I figure that is better than me skipping something and missing out.Enjoy the videos.https://youtu.be/CU1nXt4d96YSurvival Mode Game Play Short when it is finished processing:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=762877203"

It feels like you're roomscaling (walking/teleporting) around a haunted mansion full of undead people.  You have to try to blast them all and search for ammo clips as you go along.  I felt tense the entire time playing it.  Those f****ers approach you from every direction and they don't stop to wait for you to pick up ammo and reload.  But asides from 'The Walking Dead-like' plot of the story, the gameplay is awesome.  They look rather more like zombies than mutants to me.
