This comparison is tired as ♥♥♥♥, both for those making it and for those making these ♥♥♥♥ing games.I read in an interview with some schmuck from Limbic that they are slaves to a loyal fanbase that likes HOMM3 too goddamn much and that it limits their creative approach to the game. Which seems to be complete nonsense because if this game had even half of the polish HOMM3 had, MOST fans would be happy to give it a pass.The sad fact is that it is a buggy mess with hopeless AI and boring sound design. I couldn't count on two hands the amount of ""now what in the..."" moments I had during the FIRST MAP of the campaign. I was apparently one of the lucky ones, because none of the bugs were game-breaking. It just takes you out of the experience when things won't work the way they're supposed to.I am angry and have nothing better to do, so let's go through ""About This Game"" and see what points are actually valid.""A STAND-ALONE EXPANSION - ideal for existing Might & Magic Heroes VII players, newcomers and fans of previous entries alike.""HOMM has always been quite the convoluted hellraiser puzzle of a franchise, but never before as much as it is now. This little expansion is a terrible jumping on point.""A NEW EPIC STORY - Play two original and thrilling campaigns starring the recently crowned emperor Ivan and legendary Dwarven heroes.""The story is about as standard as it gets. Nothing to say about it, really.""NEW FORTRESS FACTION: DWARVES - Lead the fierce warriors, industrious blacksmiths, and masters of Rune Magic on a path to define their destiny.""Rune magic actually is quite novel for a while, but that's the only noteworthy thing about this faction.""EXPERIENCE MIGHT & MAGIC HEROES' UNIQUE MIX OF TURN-BASED STRATEGY AND RPG GAMEPLAY - Now featuring improved mechanics and additional maps.""There are no improved mechanics in this game. The skill wheel seems cool at first but it adds very little strategy-wise. If you want to cast spells, get the spell skills. Want to be might based? Get the might stuff. It's pretty straight forward.""REDISCOVER THE RICHNESS OF THE MIGHT & MAGIC UNIVERSE - filled with new heroes & iconic creatures, new artifacts, abilities and achievements.""I wouldn't be able to tell you about new heroes because the campaign is so heavily streamlined you only ever get 3 heroes to play with for WAY too long. Iconic creatures? Sure. New artifacts? They must mean the new artifact set item system. It's pretty mediocre, and the basic artifacts you find are all the least interesting thing since toenails.The sad fact of the matter is that every single complaint I have with this game would be remedied if it JUST WORKED. Go over it with a belt sander for a month, please.This game is nothing we haven't seen before, it's not as good as what was before, and i'm quite frankly getting sick of playing the ♥♥♥♥ing thing."

Not only has Ubi/Limbic not listened to their amazing and loyal fanbase, they have complelely spit in our coffee. Gameplay mechanics are actually not to bad, but the amount of bugs is just astounding! Limbic is clearly staffed with a bunch of amateurs.  For example; buildings in the new faction, fortress, are missing. Although you can still recruit units from them, they are missing from the townscreen art.  Sometimes after you win a battle, a group of random mobs join my army...I don' t even know how a game can be so buggy.My main concern however is the AI. Its completely HORRIBLE. Although it has improved upon its original release its still awful. AI offers no challenge and sticks to the same pattern. They wander aimlessly and its just pathetic to watch. Limbic has developed the WORST AI that I've ever come across. Heroes 1 and 2 is more of a challenge.Its clear that Ubi/limbic have ignored what we wanted and gone with what they thought was best. The reviews show that they were wrong but sad part is that, I still believe that they think the game is great and all the bad reviews are because we don't knwo what we are talking about..Oh well its a sad day but I offically believe that the Heroes series if dead. I'll stick to the old school classics and put this game in the books. Hopefully, a new game developer will be able to bring our beloved series up on par with the 21st century gaming."

76561198079464600,Not Recommended,445310,30344815,Posted: 5 March,all,Supernegro,"First off let me start out by saying that I want my money back.  I grew up playing Hotseat Heroes of M&M and definitely always came back to Heroes 3.  I never understood all the changes they would make in each new game and wondered why they never made a Heroes 3 with updated graphics/maps/AI and tools.  Well here it is.  Again let me reiterate, I want my money back. I read the mostly negative reviews and thought that I should stay away from this game, but one extremely boring day with friends I caved and we all bought Heroes 7 to play the multiplayer.  The game was everything that I wanted from a sequel.  In the same way that I,II,III seemed to take what worked from the predecessor and avoid pointless changes and simply update where needed this did the exact same.  There was more to do.  The heroes had more depth and complexities and the graphics and tools were all updated.  Why would anyone give this game a negative review I kept asking myself.  The AI was still dumb as hell, but that can be expected.  After initial bonus's etc...eventually it just devolves into making as many empty heroes as possible and sending them out until you get too annoyed and find their castle and kill them.  Still; the AI was really always just a stepping stone in our hotseat games so no big deal.  Then about month 5 or so the game crashed.  Little bug, nothing to worry about i thought.  Tried to reload and it crashed again.  Tried everything possible, but it kept getting stuck trying to get to the next day.  Ok, lets just go back a week.  Well we made it past the next day, but now all of a sudden we all keep getting error messages that we are out of sync. Game crashes 2 game days later.  We try another map and start over.  THis time we make it a month until the crash. We have since tried 2 more times and I have even tried the solo campaign.  We all have the expansion and it still crashes after a few weeks. I want them to fix the game and it seems like a relatively simple fix, but more than that I do want my money back.  This is worse than a terrible game.  It is a game that sucks you in with potential and then crashes and you cant play.  It would be like if Civilization 6 just ended right when you got to Feudalism or something.  Its awful."

I haven t experienced many bugs in solo gameplay(i haven t played too much of it tho) but the multiplayer is definitly broken. The online feature simply doesn t work for me at all. The game won t even connect to the game server. I found a solution using a 3rd party program to play it online via the lan feature. However i had to restart half the games i started because at some point the ai won t finish their turns. Reloading even early save games won t solve that problem either. I think its appaling to produce a game that simply doesn t work and then stop patching it.The gameplay itself is quite fun but with all the downsides i can t recommend anybody to pick it up.
76561198054180972,Recommended,445310,33560324,Posted: 15 July,all,N.W.A.,"I bought h7 complete last sale, when it was 14 euros and I can say it's worth it, if you play single/hotseat. I don't play online multiplayer so, can't speak about it.As I long time heroes franchise fan let me throw some quick points:pros: - random map- 7 resources- easy to navigate and grasping the new mechanics, thx also to the heropedia- good battle mechanics- very nice sync between units and hero abilities, you need to know tho from the start what you want to be your fighting style - magic-shooters, might- offense melee/range, etc- game balance seems decent, depending on your style you can actually have fun with factions that are played differently- diversity in battlegrounds and the lenght of the fields is a nice touch- decent waittime for AI turncons: - no sanctuary and inferno, I know there was a vote by the fans and those 2 were excluded, but Inferno shouldn't have even been on a poll and Sanctuary actually was pretty diverse and nice faction to play with complex mechanics- some random not often occuring crashes, but for now just 1 save got corrupted after trying to reload- the battle gauge, tears/blood reputation and specializations from h6 are missing, which were nice- random map no seas. I've created by now about 10-11 random maps with mixed terrain and there wasn't water in any of them. Dunno if it's some crazy luck or just water is missing from the generator.---------------------------------Summed up a solid hybrid between h3 and h5 with some nice game and battle mechanics. Would recommend it, if you wanna just chill and play casually the game."

Yes.Look, the thing is, the base game is already awesome (with the best skill system in a Heroes game I've seen and great factions, beautiful design and music (as usual) and so on). But this DLC adds great new features while fixing both bugs and things that were just annoying in the core game.The dwarves are fun, better balance than in HOMM5 (better balance in general btw) and offer some nice new mechanics.There is quite a few new maps, which improves something that bothered me in the core game.Also, there were things like the waiting mechanic taking too long, that's going a lot quicker now, improving the flow of the entire game significantly. It's a core mechanic in fights after all.All in all it's more stable than before, less crashing and graphics glitches.I'll let you decide if you want to pay the 30 bucks for it, but if you ask me, it's worth it."

I like that they included caravans, and added a town portal to every town because that used to be OP in heroes 3.I give the game probably an 8/10.  I wish some of the details were a little better and I wish they didnt screw up the factions so much. Also i wish crag hack was in the game and some of the other classic heroes. I think this game has many of the great elements of past HOMM games and some new ones too.

This is why I changed my rating to negative.It is still an amazing game however and one of the best Heroes ever. Wait until it is dirt cheap (no money to Ubisoft please!) and then play it.I waited long until I decided to buy H7 and the add-on, both due to the amount of bugs reported and due to my negative experience with H6 (which was boring and repetitive, despite the nice graphics).Well, all I have to say is, H7 after patch 2.0 is definitely worth playing and has the potential to become one of the highlights in the series. The gameplay is diverse, it keeps me coming back for more, the hotseat mode fast and entertaining, and I love the campaign so far. It is also positive that the devs added several single-player scenario maps for free.Of course the bugs are still noticeable, and the game is technically not well optimized. The most notorious problem is the memory leak: There is a constant and increasing consumption of memory and it does lead to the game becoming slow, game sounds getting distorted, and bugs like the infamous double attack getting more common. The only way to solve this right now is to actually terminate the game, wait 30-50 secs until the bloated RAM usage goes back to normal, and then start it again (rinse and repeat after another 4 hours).If a few bugs and the above described technical issues do not bother you that much, then I definitely recommend you give the game a try. H7 is slowly becoming my favorite Heroes title. And since I am confident that the devs will fix the remaining bugs (and hopefully add some more content), I rate the game positively and look forward to a 2nd expansion and further improvements."

,Recommended,445310,28355695,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,max12993,I personally loved the game and the expansion. The dwarves seem a little weak but I probably just suck. It feels like Heroes 5 to me but not as good. I still would give the game a 7/10 for a game overall. Just know I enjoy Heroes 5 -7 even though I still wish it was somebody else handling the game as I don't see Ubisoft fit enough to do it. If you only enjoyed MMH6 then I wouldn't suggest this game to you. Good luck and have fun playing!

I'm tired of listening to other longtime fans bash the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this one when Limbic has tried so hard and succeeded in making vast improvements over the sixth game, which made a lot of mistakes. I was involved with this game from the beginning as a member of the Shadow Council and hated listening to the endless tide of nitpicks and rude criticism that drowned out the efforts other of us made to provide constructive feedback to the devs.Yes, HoMM III was dope as hell. So was V. And so is VII. The music is great, the maps look great, the town screens are cool, the new creature lineups and resource types are a refreshing change and the game overall is an achievement and my friends and I love playing hotseat like we have for years. I think it's one of the best, up there with III and V.  It's kind of dumb to blast a thirty dollar price tag when all that it's lacking from the base game is some skirmish maps and a campaign that you could take or leave.Bugs are pretty bad, but they dont make the game unplayable or ruin the experience for me. Yes, They could have waited to release the game, and thats Ubisoft's fault, but Limbic made a great game and you should give it a chance if you're tempted."

,Recommended,445310,24716109,"Posted: 4 August, 2016",all,Cablenexus,"I like this game. It's simply the best Heroes VII game of modern times you can imagine.Some series turn out in casual money grabs from license owners. But for Heroes of Might and Magic VII developed by Limbic and published by Ubisoft they offer a complete product.Lot's of negative reviews for the game are about MP and for that aspect of the game don't read this review. I'm a SP only gamer and do like to play skirmish maps but just against AI. Since I did not tried MP mode I can't judge it.The game itself is a work of art and high tech design not seen in any other video game in this genre.Limbic chooses to use the Unreal engine to develop the game and the result is the first TBS game in a highly detailed 3D landscape with real mountains, cliffs and dungeons.Unit models all have a comprehensive stat list, a model sketch in the artbook and a very nice animated 3D model.Landscape is stunning and the atmosphere and the way the maps are build are most close to Homm III imho.There is a huge skill wheel, multiple spells and stats for your heroes, multiple artifacts to combine and plenty of things to do on every map.Tactical combat ius improved because it matters where your units attack and defend, how they are positioned. Also the combat maps are much bigger and diverse always integrated with the enviroment.As a long time fan of the series and owner of every collector's edition available for every Homm game I can say this is the closest approach of the series on modern hardware. There is simply nothing better. Game isn't downgraded, casual, don't have extreme DLC policies or microtransactions. It's just a full game for a full price well worth it.I don't know, and I'm really upset, why so many people are negative about the game.It's Heroes III, IV, V and VI combined in a full product.Since todays update DLC and patch we even have a random map generator like in the old days. Not seen since Heroes V and that one was even worse then III. (btw if you still like V I advice you to download the Homm 5 1/2 mod).On highest settings the game runs smooth on a mediocore PC (I have a 8 GB Intel PC woth an old AMD r7 radeon card 2 GB) and it's perfect.I really hope people who want to give the game a try really judge the product itself and not Uplay DRM or the fact that there are still bugs after release.This is not the first DLC btw. They already gave us 2 DLC for free. Lost tales one and Lost tales two are written by the original Homm IV story writer who was hired for this project. Many untold stories in two new campaigns are included with the base game.So you have the basegame with a Campaign for every faction, two Lost Tales campaigns, Loads of adventure maps, skirmish random map generator and the new DLC with the new Fortress faction and two new campaigns.Very complete product, very nice atmosphere and happy to see after so many years a great team managed to bring the original Homm III look and feel to a modern engine and let us enjoy the game again."
,Recommended,445310,24709802,"Posted: 4 August, 2016",all,Ionebear,"Great addition to the Heroes VII game. The expansion gets you a new faction, the dwarves, new campaign gameplay and most important the random map generator for the skirmish maps. Just for that it is worth the upgrade. If you are a fan of the HoMM universe, or enjoy playing a relaxing TBS, then this game will be a great addition to your collection, but if you're one of those 'there will never be another Heroes like Heroes III' then just go and install that and don't bother with this or with your negativity.Game still links to your UBI account and it's not available to buy it in their shop, only here, but links without a problem to your original game even if you bought it there originally. Also, the whole 3rd party, playing on UBI rage is a bit unfounded, I think it's cool that it links there and you can actually get some rewards for your achievements like the artefact pack, llama mount, hero decals, hero footprints and the hero rainbow trail, bubble heads and pixel mode. Makes the game only more fun really, so stop hating and give it a chance."

And the studio itself is not making any efforts at this point to fix those bugs. If you play the story mode, you will 100% encounter bugs which may cause you losing the game. However, less bugs would appear if you play with friends against AIs. It would be a great game if it is bug free. What a shame."
