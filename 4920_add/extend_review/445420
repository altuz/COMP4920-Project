,Recommended,445420,22719931,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,PhleBuster[Fruitbat Factory],"An unforgiving, highly tactical SRPG, where your troops persist from one battle to another.Aselia is quite old by now, but it deserves to be called a classic. The story is grim but captivating and incorporates some unusual ideas, like the protagonist being at first unable to speak or understand the language of the world he's summoned to. The worldbuilding is remarkable. The real meat, though, is the challenging gameplay where every choice matters and which involves absolutely 0 luck.Aselia has 7 main endings, and fully completing it can easily take 100+ hours. For that, the price point is ridiculously fair.Norio Wakamoto voices 2 characters in the game. For some, this might be worth it for that alone.Originally released in 2003.Also worth noting that Aselia is a prequel to Seinarukana, which is coming on Steam later this year, and I recommend playing this before it."

And by played, I mean obsessed. And by obsessed, I mean I played through every single permutation of the game (colloquially referred to as a 'route') twice. I think the grand total was well over 100 hours of precious life, but it was preciously spent.Aselia is one of those high fantasy stories that really grips you. It tends to hold nothing back, and is very challenging in both its strategic/tactical aspects and in its themes. The themes of said story are pretty excellent, ranging from social prejudice and slavery all the way to love, obligation, and duty (heehee).The gamplay portion, which is very significant if viewed through the lens of a typical visual novel, is challenging and diverse. There are units to train, squads to create, buildings to build, and tactical decisions to be made in the face of time limits, finite resources, and the ever-onward march to victory.The narrative portion of the game, which is still significant, is very excellent. Fans of high fantasy and gritty takes on alternate world transportation will enjoy the plot, while the average anime fan may be surprised at how dark the story goes.Don't be put off by the graphics; despite the age, this is a top-notch game. The art itself is a style unique to the developer, and while the sprites evoke nostalgia the ""cutscenes"" and events are well-done.That they're selling this game at normal price for less than $20 is a steal. If it's ever on sale, buy immediately and kiss your weekends goodbye. Fans of Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics will jump right in to the style of gameplay, and everyone else will be pleasantly surprised by the depth of both the tactics and the narrative. Look forward to literally hours and hours of enjoyment."

It has a beautiful storyline with lots of twists (some of which you don't see coming), fantastic interaction between characters, the choices you need to make to enter a character's route are a bit subtle, so here I recommend using a guide, and most importantly, for me,actualhigh repalayability value (which isn't true for a alot of VNs). What I mean by that is that each route has a (sub)storyline and missions unique to that route which makes each playthrough different enough from one another that you don't want to just give up on the game and move on. Basically a bit of strategy is required because what worked on one playthrough might not work on another. If you don't understand what I mean, play the game a couple of times and you'll see."

The characters all seem to have quite their own personality and vibe about them. The story is developing very nicely, and I love how the original japanese voice acting is incorporated into it for each  of the characters. The subtitles are visually appealing and very well-structured. Definitely a game I would recommend checking out if interested in the Visual Novel & RPG genre."
,Recommended,445420,22820781,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Vorthod,"I played this game before it came to steam and loved it. Now that I'm replaying it in preparation for the sequel that finally came out, and I am finding that I still love it. I will also mention that this game originally had erotic scenes in it and while they weren't exactly removed gracefully, they are few enough that you can easily ignore the hints that the characters got it on offscreen.As for the basics of the game, it's a strategy game where you place and move your units around the map to get into scripted battle sequences when they meet. In between battles, there is a visual novel style story about the main character trying to cope with being brought to another world and forced to fight for a king he doesn't trust.Put simply, I am a huge fan of the story and the battle system was fun enough that I actually turned up the difficulty after each playthrough when I was replaying the game to go through other routes instead of powering through lower difficulties to get the battles over with.The first thing I have to mention is the beginning of the game right after the prologue. I'm going to gush a bit about a stylistic choice made early on, so feel free to skip this paragraph. Now, I've found that very few developers have the balls required to actually have the language of the fantasy world NOT be English (or in this case, Japanese). The foreign characters in this game initially have lines voiced (and written in) in a made up language that, while obviously unknown to the player at first, is very clearly translateable. The main character is implied to spend a very long time just picking up the language when he comes to the world, but the game goes one step further by asking the player if *they've* actually managed to start picking some simple stuff up (That might sound like a horrible decision, but they don't throw you entirely into the frying pan and the results barely matter if you really don't care enough to bother; it's just for scoring a few points with the girl taking care of you). Now, the dialogue boxes eventually switch into English when the main character gets better at the language, and by your first battle, the character voices are all in Japanese instead of the fantasy language, indicating that Yuuto is fluent now. You can also switch character languages to Japanese for the whole story when you get to New Game+, but that entire process shows a level of care and dedication to the story that is honestly very rare in the games and shows I've experiences and I have to give it credit for that.Anyway, the prologue starts us off pretty slowly, but the rest of the story is quite enjoyable with multi-dimensional characters and some fun twists throughout. As mentioned before, I enjoyed both the story and gameplay immensely, though a walkthrough of choices to make to get each ending would probably be a good thing to look up on your second and subsequent playthroughs. Combine this with a multiverse lore that is just ripe for sequels and spinoffs and you have a great game to spend some time with. This is seriously a great game to check out."

My hours belong to the version sold bywww.jlist.com.)This game is designed for people in one of three categories:1) Those who have oceans of patience and actually WANT to bemicromanaging dozens of statistics every moment2) Those who wake up, look in the mirror, and marvel about howEarth is blessed to have someone so great as the person inthe mirror3) Those who like immersive role playing games.If you belong to one of the first two categories, please reada different review to this game. On the other hand, if youbelong to the third category and NOT the other two categories,I invite you to continue reading my review.(Aside note: Many thanks go out to Theonegod for making a cheattool that allowed me to enjoy Aselia the Eternal despite beingan average gamer. See Cons section point #1 for details.)Pros:+ This game presents a very immersive experience. The startingfew hours really pulls the gamer into the world of the game.+ Very few games have tried to do what this game tries to do.In other words, this game is rather unique in the world ofPC games.+ If you take the time to understand the game system, you willhopefully come to understand the genius of the game. The gameis very well crafted.Cons:- It would not have been terribly difficult for the game makerto make a difficulty game option suitable for the averagegamer, but the game maker did not do so. Therefore, if youare an average gamer, I HIGHLY recommend you go to URL:http://dakkodango.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=151.- Game design decisions were made with one thing as the firstpriority: the gamer should be handicapped in a truly absurdnumber of ways. Because of that game design priority, thereare many parts of the game that are not consistent with thelore of the game world.- The game preaches about the evils of war and wanton use ofnatural energy for the sake of convenience. The preaching getsold REALLY fast, but it persists long after the messages havebeen absolutely and positively drilled into the audience.- The game seems to be designed for lolicons. Prepare to seeand hear very young girls in your army tearing sinew, breakingbones, and ripping the earth a new one. You have been warned.- *** Extremely Important ***The skip button will skip ALL scenes between battles.Sometimes there are a dozen scenes and I only want to skip6 out of the 12 scenes. Aselia the Eternal was madeprior to the convenience of a settings screen that has optionssuch as ""skip one scene"" and ""skip all scenes"". FYIKnit-picking gripes (feel free to ignore):*) Disclaimer: I gripe because I am a fan of the genre and Iwould LOVE to see the genre get better. However, since theworld economy is slow, better games aren't getting made.Therefore, games like this continue to stand out as beingexceptional. Don't take my gripes the wrong way.1) How many times must gamers endure a complete and utter lackof proper reward for difficult tasks? I turned the air bluewith profanity when I received the same mana for the seconddragon as what I received from the first dragon. The seconddragon was 4 times the fight (at the very least)!2) Black spirits are only truly useful for the enemy since theenemy has so many more troops than the protagonist. Thisviolates the lore of the game, but since game difficulty ismore important than game lore, black spirits become benchwarmers for the protagonist. To the Abyss with that filth!3) I am continually amazed at how many difficult JRPGs haveVERY secret requirements for the good endings to the game.Seriously, is it not enough that gamers suffer through thesteep difficulty of the actualy strategy part of the game?!4)Why do the spirits at the end of the game act likethey are not swallowed by their swords? It would be closerto the lore of the game if the enemy spirits in the Empirewere all obsessed with duty, discipline, and death. Instead,many enemy spirits are still preaching about how evil war is.Get off it already--the gamers have received the message, ohAlmighty Game Design Team! Honestly, it reminds me of beingthumped with a Bible at church. Nobody wants that.5) The scripted battles add nothing to the game. In fact, theydefy game lore as well as game mechanics. They detract fromthe overall presentation of the game. Scripted battles arenothing new to JRPG lovers, but they are always unnecessary.Scripted battles are a cheap cop-out for game makers, andtherefore they will continue to be used. Oh well.6) If the game is going to have scripted blocks in the road, thegame should (expletive) TELL YOU THAT! Instead, you must makedecisions without really knowing what the game expects you todo. This game is one of the very worst I've played in thatone single regard.7) Even with unlimited resources, training units is a totaland complete pain in the backside. For some people, thistranslates into just one of many handicaps given to thegamer. For me, it GREATLY detracts from my desire to playthe game through a second time. Yes, I could play the gamethrough a second time in Normal mode. But the game offersenticement for those that play the game in Hard mode. Butif the gamer does that, the player will be once again forcedto train their units again. See the end of the PDF guide tolearn what the enticements are for those who decide to dealwith the irritation of training their units again. (Hint: itis in the Io's Boot Camp section of the guide.)Cheat tool suggestions (see Cons section point #1 for URL):1) At the very least give yourself a boatload of currency(999999 Ether). Doing this more than once during theprogression of the game will still provide the average gamerwith more than enough opportunity to save spam.2) Setting the turn counter to 1 is also VERY useful formissions that don't have story events pre-programmed tooccur at set turn numbers. Look at the PDF guide for thegame to know which missions have story events embedded inthe middle of the missions.3) If you don't constantly wish to be micromanaging the skillsof your individual units, set the skill usage cheat for allunits.Final recommendations:1) (See Knit-picking gripe #3 for the reason for this entry.)If you have a waifu you want to see ""the good end"" for...use the PDF guide for the game and hit every single +1/+5/+10 mindor love choice for that particular waifu. Of course, you willneed to complete the game twice if you want to see ""the goodending"" for Kyouko or Tokimi. And if you want to see ""the goodending"" for Uruka, choose all the subspirit optionsas opposed to choices for Aselia, Orpha, or Esperia.*** Very Important ***To get a particular waifu ending, you also mustSLAY WHOLE ENEMY SQUADS with Yuuto/waifu team2) (See Cons section point #1 for the reason for this entry.)There are seven ""good endings"" for the game. I would alsoestimate that the gamer gets 10 percent or less than theresources the gamer really needs (if the gamer is an old fartlike me). Because of those two things, I am guessing that thegamer is actually expected to play Normal mode more than onceprior to moving onto Hard mode and then to play Hard mode morethan once prior to moving onto Absurd mode (which is my wordfor the game mode as opposed to the game maker's word for it).If you read the bottom of the PDF guide, you will see the levelcaps for Normal and Hard mode. Keep those level caps in mindwhen you decide how much Ether to give yourself while cheating.OR you can decide to set the Ether pool at 500000 every timeyou boot up the game."

Both parts are executed really well, with the visual novel parts maybe taking up an a bit bigger portion.The introduction of characters and setting, and the build-up towards the first battles may feel a bit long, but once you get there you're rewarded with highly strategic (zero randomness) , turn-based RPG, which also boasts a great story. And once it gets started it really picks up pace, both in terms of story and difficulty.Since this version of the game also includes the expansion it allows for a total of 7 different routes and 9 endings.The battles quickly become very tough, combined with perma-death (and a straight game-over if a main character dies) you may end up requiring several attempts for certain battles. Especially on the higher difficulties one poor battle can see you losing characters, which becomes all the more painful thanks to all the side characters having their own story and background.Also of note is that this is the prequel to Seinarukana: The Spirit of Eternity Sword 2, which just saw it's official 'English release and will be released on Steam later this year.  Definitely a recommendation if you're a fan of SRPGs and like a good story to go along with it."

The story has pulled me in and the combat is fun and sometimes brutal. If you like either of those genres as well then you will enjoy this game. The game does show its age though so as long as you can look past that then i dont see any flaws with this game at all.
,Recommended,445420,22782125,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,Zodai,"They made an entire fictional language.  What's more, it's entirely voiced.  I totally expected the voices to swap to Japanese after the protagonist learned it enough, but nope - it's actually consistent, or at the very least what appears inconsistent at first is given an explanation.Once you pass the prologue of the first hour or two, the story becomes rather engaging through its attention to detail and setting, to the point where even the everyday slice-of-life parts manage to become more engaging than those of Clannad, at least prior to its full-on nakige/crying game moments it's known for.  The gameplay elements, while not frequent enough to be the only reason to play if you want to ignore the story (which would be very unfortunate) manage to be challenging enough to remind me of a simplified version of the cores present in games such as Etrian Odyssey or the SMT franchise.Definitely worth a purchase.  The art quality is shaky even compared to others of its era, but if you can get past that, it's a great game that manages to stand tall alongside similar stories at least twice its price.  As an introduction to the genre something like Katawa Shoujo might be less difficult, but if you're interested in VNs at all I feel at ease giving it a recommendation from my current experience."

The first play through had a lot of sad moments that would pull at your heart all the way to the end. On the next play throughs you kinda can skip most of the scenes until your route that your aiming for.The combat though is fun at come points but drags on, and on the first play through on very hard it makes thing challenging but being the same missions over 7 play throughs it gets dull. And on the final mission it takes too dam long.You have to have the determination to push through it and I can tell you now its worth it.Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who loves visual novels, choices that impact the story and beening surounded by girls ;D."

The strategy portions of the game actually will effect the outcome of the story, and the interplay of the story and strategy make you pretty invested into the troops. It isn't some generic spirit mook you are fighting with it is the cute and shy Hellion, and knowing about her makes you sad if you can't bring her home safe ;;The one thing I would say as a complaint is some of the missions are too damn long, which is ok for a pure strategy game but as the whole game is pretty much one long war campaign it seems like the missions that are super long could have been subdivided into smaller tasks with story breaking it up. Now there are some that sorta do that... kinda... but it stays in the strategy mode engine which doesn't let you save when they are talking and only gives the profile icons for people talking so it isn't as immersive as the visual novel mode engine, which has voice acting and quick saving.Anyway. The game is great. if you like visual novels or strategy games like fireemblem or super robot wars, this is a must."

,Recommended,445420,22788269,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,L Ψ Kongroo,"I bought this game on a whim because I saw it was on sale.The Prologue I found to be fairly generic and unimpressive, but I can think of a LOT of fantasy games in this style and presentation like that and quite a few of them have turned out to be gems.  So I decided to stick with it and see what happens. And once the game hits Chapter 1, I think it really starts to find its groove. I actually really like the presentation of Esperia teaching you how to speak the local tongue of the course of some months, but I may be a sucker for the Florence Nightingale effect.When they finally gave me some gameplay beyond the visual novel, I was quite surprised by the depth of the tactics and planning I had available to me.  I do think the UI could use a little more polish but it has a sort of GBA FE7 feel that appeals to me.  It's clear to me that the game is a bit old and using some retro looking effects, but I found it charming enough to go through the game twice.The cool thing about this game is that the first couple of NG+'s add new story material.  For example, you don't really understand the bully's motivations the first time through.  You get a hand-wave explanation, but it's all alluded to and it isn't really talked about until the end of the game. When you start your first NG+, the game adds an emotional scene that finally makes the bully something beyond a one-dimensional rival because they know you already know about this exchange.There are...a lot of different ending routes but Aselia's is the ""canon"" one but I've only seen hers and Esperia's (because I really like Esperia).This game is definitely not for everyone, but the gameplay is definitely unique and I do recommend it.I don't know if there's a sequel to this game, but I really hope there is."

,Not Recommended,445420,25773856,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,unwaveringresolve,"The screenshots and description make this sound like some kind of story-heavy tactical RPG - like any number of Atlas games, or the Fire Emblem series.Well, I just spent two and a half hours reading to get to a part of the game where I could actually do any tactical battling. During that period, I only had a few decision points and I have seen no sign that any of them mattered. Once I did get to the battle, I found it ot be simultaneously too easy and too hard.* Too easy, because if you play defensively then you can basically be an invincible turtle. And then your post-battle score will be crap.* Too hard, because if you push ahead fast you risk either running out of skill uses or you'll mess up your formation and get wiped out.All this might be forgivable if the writing were good, or the visuals were better. Neither of those holds true. The protagonist/narrator repeatedly breaks the ""show, don't tell"" rule when it comes to describing the people around him. Said people are kinda boring and archetypal, when they aren't outright weird. And whenever anything visually interesting is happening outside the context of a battle, the game rarely bothers to give you more than a token description against a dull image of the setting or a plain black background.I can see the potential here. I can see how complex and interesting battles could be built with this system. I can see how a compelling narrative about family and suffering under oppression could be told with these characters. I can imagine a really cool anime being made from these visual designs and action sequences. But I feel that potential has not been realized.Maybe it gets better later on, but I cannot be arsed to find out.(Also, as a matter of personal preference, I dislike the art style. It's hard for me to get engaged by all the cutesy stuff that happens with the various girls in the game when they all look like inhuman mutants - especially the smaller ones. And that part where an underage girl jumped me in the bath while calling me ""Papa!"" was just weird.)"

This VN is easily one of the best I've played, not just because of the story, the music, the atmosphere, the way it handles the whole ""transported to another world"" aspect, and the way its written, as well as the strategy elements involved force you to think hard, because every mistake you make could set you back for the rest of the game (unless you reload a save)This isn't a traditional VN, a very heavy chunk of it involves a strategy portion where you command your ""armies"" (About 15 or so spirits divided intp 1-4 squads) to battle it out across the continent on various routes of conquest. The combat is unique in the way that each position has a unique role in battle, and lacking one could mean the end for those unfortunate enough to be in the squad. Not only that, the spirits (class would be more appropriate) dictate who would be best where. Blue for frontline attacker/stopping magic attacks, green for the damage soaking defender/healers, red for the arcane assaulters in support, black for a (very poor) position filler, estrangers are like black spirits but LEAGUES more useful. You'll learn more as you go.The music, while limited to about 20 song, is amazing despite its decade old age. The art as well, as I said before is apart of its charm. The art might repel some people, but if you look past it, everything else will pull you in, and before you know it you'll have sunk 10 hours into this easy. That being said, its about a 50 hour clear for the 1st clear, and seeing as there are multiple routes, this will require some replaying to get them all. As there are no acheivements, and currently no full 18+ patch, replaying it really is more of a willpower thing for most people. There are some things that are in subsiquent clears that the 1st doesn't feature, but there could be more incentive. If a full 18+ patch were added, it would add more incentive to buy, and 100% complete the game (JAST please), but I'm getting off track.Buy this VN, for $15 it is without a doubt, well worth the price, and playtime."
