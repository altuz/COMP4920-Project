,Not Recommended,445720,30199372,Posted: 26 February,all,Slick Willy,"Pay to win advantage. Not really that tactical if you face better units. Lack of balance.  I'd prefer to pay for the game, and for everyone to have the same opportunity to win."

76561198221182092,Not Recommended,445720,29930290,Posted: 14 February,all,jamie.edwin.thomas,I would not recomend this game to anyone. Never is there a fair and equal match. Even when I win there is no joy to it. It's only place is to sypon mini transactions out of you. I'm fairly sure it's been hacked for cheating. Steer clear of this one and all games made by this group.

,Not Recommended,445720,30018148,Posted: 18 February,all,✠AwesomeDoge144✠,"I played for almost an hour, after the first 3 missions/level things, I had to play in multiplayer to get better. Multiplayer could be fun, but it is just full of people who payed money to beat everyone else and it is just boring too because you have to also pay money to do most of the things in the game. The creators of this game could improve by removing most Pay to Win options. I would recommend you keep away from this game."

And some godlike tanks etc, its just sad. Just don't spend time in the game, it has no tactics, as the odds are skewed if the other one pays"

,Recommended,445720,30049462,Posted: 19 February,all,mrempireman,"Alright let me just make this known. About 90% of F2P games have some kind of P2W element to it. So what makes a F2P truly  P2W. Lets say 2 players went into a battle and one had better equipment then the other, but the other player was better. If the player who had better equipment wins then thats truly P2W in my opinion.  From playing this game I can say that the player whos better with worse equipment will win most of the time.So technically this game is P2W just like most F2P games, but this one is skill before money."

76561198070616040,Not Recommended,445720,29596157,Posted: 30 January,all,nicotin_for_you,"Changed my review after hiting a higher tier. the games with failry balanced opponents are ok, most people have different strategies but the tank destroyer wich is found only in training, the huge difference in army strenght AND THE CHEATERS will ruin your fun after level 6. Better wait or play something else if this sounds like the things that you don't like10/10Now that i have your attention, open your mind and read this:This is curently an excellent game that you play for 30-60 minutes every day, logging 1-2-3 times, it is amazing at what it is and what it does.For those who know Highgrounds, this is animated less variety highgrounds.It's and excellent little strategy game, think of hearthstone with more animations but with the same flawsYou get a lot of troop cards and you take 8 in each battle, you have a max of 10 command points wich regenerate and you use to play the cards in any way you want. they are deployed on the map on 1 of the 2 lanes or your teritory. It's hard to explain but the game is fully animated with good sounds and fun(ny) graphic style.What makes this game awesome is that strategy is always the thing that wins the game except for when the enemy is very very upgraded. Your units can be rank 2-3 and the enemy 4-5 and you can win in a very short time or even snipe a tower and defend. It's all about the tactic you have, the cards you use and the strategy you decide to use in the game depending on the enemy.For example: 1)you can even base build with hornet nests, howitzers and troop camps, then attacking with 1-2 units or artilery.2) You can only take troops and always be on the attack with light/medium tanks, mortars, infantry or commandos3) mix them both and have a nice game4) cheese your opponent with defence and a lot of artilery or a heavy tank/ air strikes/drops (8 command points while regular infantry is 4 command and medium command points/average on cards in army is 4,1-4,5 depending on player)5)Snipe towers with jeeps/air drops/artilery6)Swarm the enemy with soldiers from bases and fast attacks with buffs from officer.Trivia: this is the second game from the series, battle islands( i think it was a pioneer to f2p games on steam) is a garbage of a copy of clash of clans, really bad game but it helped to make this gameSpoiler: i know this is a copy of clash royale but this game is to clash royale what elder scrolls legends is to hearthstone. The gold edition with all dlc, patches, expansions, player mod vs the early acces alpha version.Sugestions for developer:1) There are cheaters who make you lag and lose reaction time, in time this will destroy the game so FIX it.2) Fix alliances, no one donates to you because they need it, no one accepts a challenge because it's useless, there is literaly no point in having an alliance3) Add more game modes and more singleplayer elements.Directions for the game to take:Add factions, at least 3 factions, each with 3 common, 1 rare and 1 epic unit to their army.Add wars in wich the factions fight for teritory, teritory generates little crates and resourcesAdd alliance wars and alliance camps(where players upgrade stuff, fight stuff and train)Add more maps like a map with 3 towers, a map with longer lanes, a map with natural defences or where events happen like an artilery attack, gas attacks, resource drops etc.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add a 2vs2 map or even PLEEEEEASE 3vs3 map, those modes would be playing without any reward, i guarantee.Also add something like a singleplayer when other players are offline so you can attack afk/on players for a 1-5% of their resources or else everyone will hoard them and buy all units or some units to max.And the last thing:  add a consistent multiplayer map of the real world where every country holds the players that chose it and fight for the borders/resources/scor or just fun."

,Not Recommended,445720,29991598,Posted: 17 February,all,BoyWithGunz,"It's fun for the first 3 levels and 800 points (skill or what ever that is) but then you either get some extreme P2W players or level 7+ with 1200 points and well there is NO POINT playing because you WILL lose.It is F2P game and if you are looking for a quick strategy game fix then you will like it for about ~3 hours but if you don't want to spend any real money then you are Fd.I like it but P2W , RNG(loot) and HUGE skill cap make it unplayable."

,Not Recommended,445720,30091677,Posted: 21 February,all,SS MONTE 03,Not my style of game. Loved the first one. They must have ran out of addons for it. and thought this would be equal. I would rather build up a fort. I love the game. Banished. Can you figure out something with a cross of banished. And your war style.
76561198090909307,Recommended,445720,30238863,Posted: 28 February,all,Denniz079,"I like the graphics, sounds and gameplay. But sometimes the matchmaking is frustrating. As a matter of fact, I also had opponents lvl 1 even when i'm lvl 3 and own much more medals. After that I faced a opponent as lvl 6 with 1100 medals vs. me lvl 3 and 700 medals. To make things worse, I lost the game and searched for a new game again: and again faced the same opponent! I had no chance! These are things that are frustrating for f2p players, furthermore it is possible to reach the top by strategy, even when other players say this ain't possible. Still recommend the game, problem might be there are too little players and that this is causing the matchmaking problems."
