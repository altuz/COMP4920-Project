Messed up little horror game for a fair price with a well told messed up story. Reminds me of 'Home', but a little different, and without branching endings. Takes about 30 minutes to beat. Did I mention it's f***ed up? Because it is. Happy Leap Day!"

My playtime is really only 30 minutes despite the 25.9 hours being displayed.This is probably a safety feature added by the developer to make sure people don't just beat the game in 30 minutes and Steam refund it afterwards.

(Theres only about a half hour of gameplay to it)Only $2 but it's not 2spooky, just the regular amounts of spooky.I'd suggest not reading all of these spoiler-laden reviews and just jumping right in. You can do worse with $2.It's not perfect (the plot is a bit thin) but it's not terrible and is pretty decent at buidling a spooky atmosphere."

It's sick, disturbing and creates a palpable sense of unease.It relies on some standard horror cliches, but its unexpected, harrowing ending made my skin crawl.Misleading title, did not feel settled."
,Recommended,445750,21583522,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,Lmod,"Good game!  Short and sweet, about an hour from beginning to end.  Definitely worth the $2.Basically, it's an interactive story.  Doesn't rely on decision making or skill, more like a short story that you play through instead of read, and a well written one at that!"

I can definitely recommend it for the price. I'd like to see a more complex game from the developer in future."
,Not Recommended,445750,22305008,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,Adaru32,"If only there was a neutral button for a recommendation option. I have mixed feelings about this game.Pros:- pretty twisted story- nice use of symbolism- great art work/graphicsCons:- very straight-forward, so it's very easy to play- more story-based than actual game play (then again, it does say in the description that it's some sort of a story-based game)- a bit of back-and-forthing- very short (about 25-30 minutes)Overall, I would recommend it if you're bored enough to want to pass the time for an interestingly twisted story (if you're into that kind of stuff). However, I would not recommend it due to how short it is, and how easy it is to play it."
76561198140442560,Recommended,445750,25079449,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,IAmThePonch,"The game is about a man going through his home and remembering things about his daughter. The 2D graphics add a nice sense of unreality to the proceedings, and the subliminal images wer suitably freaky.This is a vague review because to say much more would be to spoil the late game twists. But this is a creepy, unsettling little title that maages to feel unique thanks to its style and atmosphere. Worth a look for horror fans, especially on sale, even if it is pretty short."

,Recommended,445750,35053837,Posted: 18 September,all,Zurkon,"A fantastic mix of subtle and strong horror.It's hard to discuss more without spoiling it, so I'll just say it's a strong story and a brisk play time.Definitely Worth Playing"
76561198056907421,Recommended,445750,21577763,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,serialzero,"A fantastically twisted interactive horror story with some refreshingly original cut scene graphics.  The atmosphere and sound effects are great.  The whole thing was somewhat reminiscent of the spirit of Silent Hill, in my opinion.  Doesn't take very long to complete, but the experience is worth every damn penny.  XD"
76561197970447700,Recommended,445750,21859722,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,oneclipleft,"As an interactive horror short story, Settled is pretty neat. It tells a coherent story and brings the player into the mix, revealing narrative chunks at a good pace through text and cutscenes. There's a somewhat interesting twist, which some players may realize before the story reveals it. The horror elements are mostly well done, although some feel a little random or out of place. The thing this game does best is build a mysterious and creepy atmosphere that allows the other horror elements to work. As a game, though, there isn't much besides walking around and clicking on highlighted objects. The price is good for what you get."

On one hand,I don't really feel like I gained anything, the story didnt't really engage me, on the other hand it was pretty creepy at some points. The issue being that at what shoud've been the creepiest point, the final cutscene. I didn't feel overly creeped out or surprised, as I had figured out the twist already. Just kind of... dirty I guess? Two dollars would probly be better spent on like, a soda or something."

Game is short roughly 30 min long and for its price its worth it. The pixel-art style cut scene where very good and suited the game's art very wellI did a play through if anyone is interested (will upload rest of it soon)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFS9OgXsf6"

,Recommended,445750,29768759,Posted: 7 February,all,SociallyAwkwardGirl,"Clearly the facial transplant did not turn out as had been hoped, but I don't see this as horror necessarily. It seems like drama to me, with a touch of comedy.  It's an unfortunate story about someone who wanted to be a father, so they got a child and kind of ripped off its face instead; then they felt kind of bad about it. I mean unlucky things happen to all of us. Besides, the little girl was asking for it. It was just karma. This is just what happens when you like unicorns. Technically they still have a little girl. They're just being pessimistic. The little girl is just in multiple pieces now, but beggars can't be choosers."
,Not Recommended,445750,23888131,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,orange,"Sound design and graphics are pretty alright and really the only redeeming factor. Story is not particularly riveting as far as horror games go, and there isn't enough 'meat' to it to really call this a story-driven game.There's no option to exit from or skip through text so everytime any appears on the screen (CONSISTENTLY only one or two sentences at most) you have to wait 5-10+ seconds.The game would definitely benefit from ALL of the interactable items having flavor-text, not just the coat. It's not the only thing that changes so it doesn't make sense for it to be treated as such.(SPOILERS)You play as a regular old dad who's very upset his daughter died and has resorted to killing people and collecting cow heads to bring her back! Except, not really. The story is very unclear and the 'twist ending' where it turns out you're some random dude that killed the father because he wanted to have his daughter for himself did not clear anything up at all.There's a motif of cow skulls and and sacrifice for what seems to be no real reason. There's a specific instance in the game (and in one of the preview screens) where the Star of David / Seal of Solomon is used in place of where a pentagram would be in a spooky game like this, but I couldn't find any correspondence between either symbol and cow heads so it doesn't make any sense. Literally the only thing that's cleared up by the """"""BIG TWIST"""""" are the scenes where you approach 'yourself' from behind all spooky-like (you as the killer are approaching the father from behind). Everything that isn't extremely obvious to piece together by just playing the game doesn't make sense at all.If the twist was instead that the daughter got murdered and the father is sacrificing people to bring her back the game would make a LOT more sense (especially the scene where the wall says 'DAD LET ME DIE'?? like that doesn't make any sense in the context that you're playing the random killer).The story is just a goddamn mess."

'cause that's gonna determine how much you'll enjoy this game. If it's high, you'll enjoy this little story. If it's low, give it a pass.The gameplay in this game is just a process of moving from one checkpoint that moves the story along to another. There's enough minor things changing along the way that looking at objects multiple times is worthwhile, though if you're only interested in getting through the story you'll find that searching for whatever object gets you back to the story is annoying. Fortunately, there isn't a large swath of objects to interact with so searching is decently short. It's a plus that the gameplay caters to both the person who will click on every interactable object just to see what's there and the person who just wants to get through the game, but the latter type of player will find the gameplay unpleasant.It's clear that Settled is more focused on its story and setting, because both are quite well-done (if a bit thin at times). There are a few semi-traditional jumpscares, but they don't come out of nowhere - they're built up to using the environments you go through and the sounds you'll hear. Things moving out of the corner of your eye, minor graphical changes in an object you think you've seen over and over - it's the little touches that really give the game an eerie atmosphere. It's good, but nothing in this game is going to seem revolutionary. Without spoiling, blood and guts get thrown around pretty liberally but I sometimes wondered why it was even needed. This is where your tolerance of weirdness is really going to come in handy. The designer clearly has a good understanding of how to build atmosphere and move a story along in a way that feels genuinely strange and uncanny. The somewhat gratuitous blood doesn't always seem in line with that. People with a high tolerance for weird will probably enjoy the story and be able to forgive some of the weaker points in the narrative. You just want some well-made weirdness? You'll get a decent dose of it from this game.Personally, I had a great time with the game. I like a good short experience and I always enjoy seeing a game with a good horror foundation. If that's what you want, give it a try."

You will get about 30 minutes of game for the $2 ticket to this experience. It's creepy, atmosperic and weird without being cheesed up with jump scares. Highly recommended for someone looking to kill 30 minutes with some decent story telling and cool atmosphere. Not recommended for people who want to play a game, as this is more like an interactive short film.3.5/5 download it now!"
