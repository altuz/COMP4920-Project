,Recommended,445770,23205646,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,U2NUMB,"Alright after a couple of hours I feel I can place some of my thoughts here along with some things that need to be added or fixed.First off the game is very similar to the previous Airport Madness games but with the aspect of real 3D geometry. Overall it is a fun game with the same goals and feel of the previous game but it certainly could use some fixes. Below are some missing or questions I have for the game. I am however 100% suggesting you buy this game if interested because it is unique and fun.1) Would love a distance to airport added above each plane.2) Visuals of the ground need a serious upgrade. This game could look amazing with this part updated.3) Some bugs / glitches are there like plane icons getting stuck floating. I am sure this will be fixed.4) No esc option in game? At least my system would not pause or anything while hitting this key.5) Would love a free cam option.6) Clicking planes can often be a problem when they are stacked up. Not sure what the solution is but at certain angles you can click the wrong plane and give orders.7) Highest overall quality asset is the fake twitter images that pop up.8) Speaking of the fake twitter, it is often totally wrong. People complaining about delays when the airport is running as smooth as possible. This part annoys me because it if was accurate it could be a cool addition. As it stands now it seems to just be the same thing over and over no matter what is happening on screen.9) The game does take a while to nail down the best view for your playstyle. Not really a knock on the game but an FYI, do not give up if you do not like the controls or view. Adjust in the settings.10) Would love an overall passengers moved stat. Planes moved is nice but lets go a step deeper.11) Stress meeter? Not sure what this means as I was flying along moving planes like an ace with no stress and it just kept growing.12) Obviously more content. Only 4 airports at launch and I know more are promised but it is info that people need to know.Overall the game is still super unique and fun and I will easily get my value out of it but there is a TON of potential that I hope we see in a future release."

I've poured hundreds of hours into this franchise from the PC browser days, to the mobile apps, to the standalone PC versions, and on to repurchasing and clocking hours on the other 4 titles here on Steam. The developer himself is an air traffic controller, and I've probably dealt with more digital aircraft than he's handled real planes. (Although he has a much better safety record than I do!).. So I openly admit that even as a 33 year old man, I giggled like a strange psychotic Schoolgirl when this game was announced.So was I right to have an outburst that would have landed me in a padded cell? Oh yes I was!! Only one PC game could stop me playing Stellaris in my free time this year and Airport Madness looks like it will have done the job perfectly.. I know, I'm a filthy casual.. and a proud one at that!So firstly, I would advise that you search for other 2 dimensional Airport Madness games on Steam and then also play this one too. Because Airport Madness 3D is not a simulation. It is a casual, fun, addictive Air Traffic Control game.. It causes my wife to ring the police and send out search parties every time I play it. That's how hooked you can become on these games.Anyway.. Airport Madness 3D goes to an additional dimension, and unlike other gaming franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and a few others games that have made a transition from 2D to 3D.. this game is actually suceeds the giant leap and becomes all the better for it. The game is more difficult than before and a little slower paced in some respects. But the challenge it brings adds a new appeal to the game.The single greatest feature for me though is to finally have the viewpoint of sitting in an ATC tower. The need to keep an eye on the ground and air radar, to search the skies for incoming aircraft to avoid collisions and judge when to push outgoing traffic is something I have been longing for. So if you do wish for an ounce of simulation somewhere in this game, that is where you'll find it. There are also sky, runway and cockpit cams. But these aren't nearly as fun as being lord of all you survey.Good news is, if you are looking for a friendly developer who adds plenty of free content, bug squishes like he actually knows what he's doing and listens to his fanbase and community, you will find him here. So many developers neglect this basic requirement in aftersales, even if we are all rabid wolves who have tasted developer blood, and often look for more... No bloodthirst required here.This review probably isn't helpful.. If it has been then great. I love this game, as I do it's predocessors. No I do not know the dev personally, I just apprieciate the time he finds to do this in real life, then come home and surround himself in his work until he sleeps. Not many people can do that, and it's certainly admirable. Airport Madness is the perfect mix of the real life and arcade style fun. Best of all, you will not fall asleep playing this like real ATC agents who get fired and then battered in the news like some pinata.So if you have an interest in these types of games, aviation, or like me never knew something that seems so boring as a job could actually be so much fun, then buy this game already!EDIT: I also nominated this game for a 2016 Steam award, that's how much I like it. And well, I also wanted the top badge on offer, so you have to edit or write a review on a nominated game. That's the purpose of this paragraph and maybe relevent depending how seriously you took these awards."
,Recommended,445770,24485952,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,Bad Whippet,"This is NOT meant to be a serious Air Traffic Control game!There - I had to get THAT out of the way because of the staggering number of negative reviews panning it for not being a serious ATC simulation.  If you're after a serious air traffic controller game, then move along because there is nothing for you to see here.  But for everyone else who just wants a way to release their inner insanity, this is a CASUAL game - recognisable instantly to anyone already familiar with BigFatSimulations' more casual games and especially the original (2D) Airport Madness game.  For anyone who wants a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, it is brilliant!Gameplay is as simple as clicking on a plane and choosing one of 2-3 minimal options.  There is nothing advanced about it, and no ATC-game skills or knowledge are required.Come fly with me (or not)Within about 5 minutes of starting this game, you will undoubtedly have at least three to five planes on (and off) the runway at any one moment.  Incoming planes ignore the wreckage of the previous crash you caused, while departing planes are dispatched nose-to-tail with no separation whatsoever (so yeah, DON'T fly with me).  It's ludicrous and delightfully silly, with equally-silly tweets such as: ""A piece of plane has just flown past my window - #MAYDAY!"" popping up on screen.  Planes arrive thicker and faster while you have no chance of controlling the rush.  Nobody seemed to mind as one plane landed over the splintering wreckage of my last catastrophe, and neither did it mind that it had another plane lining up for take-off right under its belly.  THIS is how we solve the world's crowded skies, people!The graphics are fairly basic but they do the job.  For a game on such budget graphics, it is a pleasant surprise to find a number of flexible 3D camera views - including an in-cockpit camera for players wishing to see the mayhem they're causing first hand.  The only small gripe I have is that it can sometimes be difficult to click on the plane I actually want when on the airport apron (usually this is when the plane isn't the foremost plane in view) but other than that it's a splendid casual game and even more fun than the Airport Madness top-down game that came before it."

That being said, it is really fun and the best ""out of the box"" simulator I have played.  I enjoy that you can cruze in from the pilot's perspective and still issue tower commands.  I also like the games intensity.  Want more maps like the non-3D version.I'm not a huge fan of doing the 'ground control' as no day shift tower control does both.  Also wish the controls were a bit smoother (always clicking top left is annoying).  Instead of ""slow down"", perhaps warn of ""company traffic, crossing or ahead"".Well worth the money, love the game, love pushing tin beyond what is actually allowed.Get it!"
,Recommended,445770,23278655,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,cHabu,"I'm biased because I have all Airport Madness games. Airport Madness 3D could not be missing in the collection so i was fortunate to get the game as a birthday present.If you have played previous versions of Airport Madness, the game play won't be that different. You need to click slightly below the airplane to get the menu and in my experiance the sky cam view is the best way to play. Tower view is my second choice.Although the game is not yet bug-free, i can't think of a big negative (yet). The positive is future airport additions  and of course the possible addition of the workshop. Looking forward of spending more time in the game.My advise for the developers would be to add aircraft types in the label and to give players more choices in runway combinations (if you have multiple runways).Airport Madness 3D has so much future posibilities, the sky is almost the limit. ;)...but then again, i'm biased."
,Recommended,445770,23244907,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,huangyihe,"You would enjoy this game if you do not consider air accidents as horrific events and/or want to see frequent and fancy explosion graphics. Your job as an air traffic controller in this game is NOT to direct ALL aircraft safely to the ground, but to strategitically line aircraft up so that they crash into each other at a desired (and hopefully minimum) pace. That appears to be the only sensible way to handle the insane traffic volume with the limited options you have. Even that is hard to do though, because pilots may disregard your last-minute ""go around"" command, so occasionally you end up killing more people than needed. But again, safety is not the whole point, all you can do is to accept that crashes are the only natural forces that keep the airport running, and to make difficult decisions about which planes to sacrifice. I hope I'm making it very clear.10/10 would crash again."
,Not Recommended,445770,28952085,Posted: 2 January,all,Stephen B.,"If you're looking for a realistic ATC simulator, this is NOT it. Completely unrealistic how planes come flying in unapproved and within a second's notice and how airplanes can't use alternative taxiways to leave the runway. Their landing speeds are also unrealistic, which causes accidents with other aircraft."
76561198044014556,Recommended,445770,25063725,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,overcast204,"If you want a surprisingly engrossing 3D puzzle that requires attention to a lot of moving parts, this game is for you. If you want a detailed ATC sim, this won't fit the bill.Airport Madness 3D has relatively simplistic gameplay -- watch for incoming planes, adjust their speed and approach runways to space them out sufficiently, and then make sure that planes at the gate are directed to the runway for takeoff. The challenge comes in synchronizing all these elements and judging various factors -- the time it takes a plane to lineup, accelerate, and clear the runway, for instance -- in order to ensure smooth operation. It sounds simple, but in practice, you can lose yourself in the game and you get a little feeling of accomplishment once you have a well-oiled machine.One of the most unique aspects of a game at this price point is the continual updates and improvement the devveloper has made to the game first release. This has included new maps, new aircraft, new interface elements, and even tweaks to physics modeling and plane instructions based on player feedback.As stated above, if you want a simple but surprisingly engrossing puzzle game with high replay value to help you kill an hour or so and then check out easily, this will hit the spot."

It's fun and challenging to stagger aircraft from the point they are ready to push back to take off and then from landing all the way to the gates.   I definitely recommend this game for anyone who wants to have some fun on seeing what it's like to be an Air Traffic Controller.
,Recommended,445770,30371635,Posted: 7 March,all,BRIG Thompson [1BDE],Another game that I bought on my phone and then got on the computer because I found it really fun and wanted to clock up hours for the memes.The price is a little high for what it is but you get all the airports/gamemodes all for the same price whereas on mobile youhave the spend about $2 per airport past the 1 default one.It is a great time waster with a tiny bit of strategy.

I have aircraft landing with the aircraft tow truck still attached to the front wheel. Pretty amusing. Also, aircraft explode on taxi ways without a colission, if you make any changes to settings while the game is running, there is a status baloon bug that shows itself, static floating in mid air. There is also an ocasional bug that causes a parked aircraft to backout all the way into a runway.Otherwise, the game is a lot of fun!"

Something the bigger software companies could learn a thing or two from.The graphics are smooth and the detail is enough to give you the right sense of perspective of the aircraft.

Now You can view all your near misses from the sky, runway, tower and for those really great ""HOLY CRAP,THIS IS GOING TO HURT!"" moments, you can view it from the pilot's perspective as well. NO this doesn't have all the realism of FSX but it's fairly close and besides it's not a $25 game with $75 worth of add-on's either :)   What it is , is one of those highly addictive single player games that is easy to play without getting board because the settings in the game give the player a choice of challenging options and features. such as the game can be played entirely by using just your mouse because the 'Click and Drag' feature allows the player to scan the entire sky in search of that next Ai pilot just looking to put a dent in your perfect record. I would highly recommend this game to anyone of any age.

All too often, I'm landing planes looking in one direction and the accident that ends my session happened atthe other end of the runway, and I ALWAYS miss seeing it.   At least if the camera pans to that direction I'll know what happened and why I have to start over.

Old fans might find it tiresome to have to switch,especially with having to look around. This is the main culprit in what positions itself as an established arcade game. However, with more and more users being used to 3d, this might not be an issue for many.The arcadishness and the inevitable addiction level is still here. In this respect, everything is just as it should be - rapid action, Indiana Jones moments abound ( just check Vancouver map).For a newcomer, this is a rather addictive arcade, sadly devoid of humour, purely technical, good for those who would stick their tongue out and try to do perfect in the increasingly (or not - game options) hectic world of (unrealistic but fun) ATC/Ground Control."

The models look pretty good and the game runs good on my low end Mac on almost max. After a while of playing around with it on Continuous, you start to get the hang of it and can slowly open up the options menu and to crank up the difficulty. It gives you some arcade style free play that should keep you going for a while.Notable downsides are: Traffic gets too crazy over ""3"", which I found to be the max realism. Anything over that will just feel arcadish and it will feel more like Diner Dash. It just doesn't feel real. Menus could use some work...""New Airport"" should be replaced with ""Main Menu."" ""Exit"" should be replaced with ""Quit."" That seems more uniform with other games. Mods would be cool. Simple changes to the game play, i.e. light work loads followed by daily pushes. Airports like BJC Rocky Mountain and Toronto City should be more GA airports...no A380s on short strips.All and all, this game is some good fun. Sad there isn't a game like this for console."

Higher traffic doesn't mean more exciting.  Only, I guess, a little more frustrating.  Not enough content to what you have and can DO.
