I was up and flying in seconds and I even configured my HOTAS and was able to use it without any trouble. The game looks very promising. I recommend it.One downside: I never experienced motion sickness in my life until I played this game. Yikes!  I don't think it's the game's fault, though."

Game is nice & colourful but there is only 3 rooms and they get old very quickly - they are adding a Supermarket soon but really there needs to be many more play areas added,  12 total would be a good number. I played in short bursts at different times thru the day and never once found anyone online at all in Australia, so I would say if you want MP this game is not ready as you can only go against Bots.  The game also desperately needs to have some good Sound effects implemented, the aircraft & weapon noise is very basic and the Oculus Dimensional & Positional sound is not used at all. There is one music tune playing which you will want to turn off after 5 minutes. Difficult to fully recommend although it has great potential,  I would say wait until a Steam sale, value is more around $6.49 not $12.99. Rate 5/10."

The physics are nice and simple, while the combat is relatively slow paced but still takes some strategy.  I also really like the art design of it and I think it just works great, flying around in a tiny toy airplane is just cool. A number of people have brought up motion sickness, but that kind of seems to be normal with these kind of games when you first start playing them.  General VR sickness rules apply though, once you start feeling a little sick just stop immediately and come back the next day.  Soon enough, depending on how susceptible you are, you wont get nauseus anymore. I do think it's a great benefit to use even just a cheap joystick though as it's a little bit more natural than a controller or mouse and keyboard.  This is game is worth a try for the price, and the developers are adding more to the game in the form of more maps, game modes, and recently new aircraft that should be more bearable when it comes to motion sickness."

76561198018706390,Recommended,445860,29514800,Posted: 26 January,all,Panchoz19,"Never before had i gotten motion sickness in a game but being a true gamer and knowing it would pass (which it did) i pushed through and adapted, I literally had to sleep the first time I played this, the motion sickness is intense but the experience is still worth it. I've  played through half of the campaign and still can't wait to go back after i finish and try to get higher scores! The music in my opinion doesnt get old and is suitable for a game where you battle  as toy planes, you can turn off the music in game and put your own if that bothers you. I use a ps4 controller through DS4 and it works perfectly. I'll add more to my review if i really think of a good ideas i would like to see implemented in the game.I love the game , good job developers!!!<<EDIT>>I've thought of some ideas and im going to try to explain them the best that I can.- 1) planes need to have more special abilites or uniqueness, meaning if the double decker is going to have great handling i want it to be able to turn on a dime to outmaneuver its opponents, I want the airliner to have enough armor to take 6 hits rather than 3(as it appears in my cabin console which if it has more health i think it should be displayed there) since it's slower than the other planes and can't turn so quickly. I want the jet to be even faster. I want the game to become more strategy orientented, for example if a team of players with all jets decided to rush for the flag who would stop them? They have enough firepower to make  wall of shooting disks that would be bound to take out some competition then fly out with the flag. But if the helicopter with """"""""increased rate of fire for gumballs or increased projectile speed"""""""""" we're holding out by the side of the doorway waiting to pick off people who came through, the game would rely more on teamwork and strategy. The game does have the element but i feel like this would bring more individuality to the game, Players would choose their poison and stick with it being helicopter defenders or jet flag capturing specialists.- 2) Weapons and equipment:Yes, i said equipment, we have the choice to select which 3 weapons we want our plane to have, but 2 weapons to controll with your headset seems a little excessive, I only really do aiming with on of them, otherwise im just shooting for luck. I think equipment like mirrors to go around the plane taking up the left socket( although they can be placed on both sides while taking up one socket) while the gumball gun sits on the right, then the left trigger could just be there to maybe flash a light and blind possible tailers( the blinding is just a wild idea that would give the mirrors a button function) but more importantly letting me behind me if im in a plane where i can't easily see behind me, or if that's not possible maybe a ""back up camera in my little front console, theres extra room with gadgets that work, why not add more? Another gadget I've thought of is like one of those air cannon toys. This wouldn't be a weapon that would shoot towards the front( maybe placed on the bottom of the plane but taking up the left socket) but would shoot towards the rear. This could possiblly damage planes chasing you or make them lose control and spin out to give you a chance to get away as well as a speed boost, give slower planes or planes in a chase a chance to catch up, damage their opponent or escape.- 3) recoils, reload, overheatingWeapons can be fired forever with no repercussions. I feel like aiming and chasing would be harder if guns had recoil, overheating or reload timesA) the Shooting Disk Weapon should be the casual all around weapon that players get used to quickly.B) the Gumball Cannon should have a recoil and different ammo clip sizes; for smaller planes a recoil could help them turn around quickly if the plane bounce up after a shot, could slow them down while shooting which would make them easier to target. Looking at ammo clips, slower or less manueverable vehicles could get larger ammo clips which could give them edges in head to head combat and smaller faster more agile vehicles smaller clips evening the score.C)The Tac gattling guns are great, but they also fire forever with no problems. I believe a small recoil, and perhps a like heat limit( unlimited ammo still but if you fire it for too long you will have to wait till you can fire again)- 4) EnvironmentRandom additions of danger (meaning they could jump in the game at anytime during a match) could help force players to change their routes and use the map entirely. Adding pets like dogs the jump up to try to catch players will force them higher into the air. Cats could hide up in the higher places like on the top of bunkbeds, tables, refridgerators and swat planes out of the out of the air. Mice could fight with the soldiers up to in the vents blocking off pathways with battles. Also random spawns of balloons could fill the flying space with more places to hide behind and outmaneuver enemies.- 5) CustomizabilityI'm earning medals but nothing else.I want to have a little elephant good luck charm or dice to hang in my cockpit somewhere, maybe  have a smiley face sticker on my wings, or have my plane have shark teeth for otherplayers to see, or have my plane fart confetti. Little things like that, OH or put my planes name on the side of it.Also i would like to customize my aiming crosshair color, i'd like orange or pink, and the blue color is sometimes hard to distinguish from the walls, or it doesn't always pop in a dogfight.These are all just ideas, whatever my good friends choose to do with my beloved Toy Plane Heroes I'm sure they worked hard and i'll be happy either way. I shared this game with my buddy and he was astonished, and felt sick like I did but still absolutely loved it! I'll remember the name Oasis VR when i'm in the market to buy some new vr stuff in the future, Keep doing what you guys/gals are doing over there!"
76561198001758110,Recommended,445860,32334645,Posted: 10 June,all,Zavri,"Pros: Really fun game. Definitely brings me back to the Sarges Heroes games I used to play growing up. The themeing is spot on. Shooting and flying all the different aircraft works great on my xbox controller. The game shines in multiplayer, the campaign so far is decent.Cons: If you get motion sick in VR, you should stay away. I do not get motion sick in VR, I can play any game including detatched and eve valkyrie, hell I can stand up and look around on a VR rollercoaster without any effects. But this game? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ using the stunt plane I definitely felt uncomfortable in a dog fight. I didn't get ""sick"" per say, but felt very uncomfortable in that particular plane when I have a speed power up.Playerbase is almost non existent. I only managed to get one public game lobby going and a few of them were friends. It's still new though so maybe it will pickup. Worth grabbing just for the campaign though and you can always make a ""multiplayer"" game with bots.Worth the price though."
76561198004664689,Not Recommended,445860,22901628,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,Malcifar,"This is a cute game with a lot of potential, but for those who are prone to motion sickness it is a no go at the moment (I guess the ""VR COMFORT: INTENSE"" warning is a VERY honest assessment in that respect). I would love to see a control scheme more like Anshar Wars 2 (for the Gear VR), where you use the headset to control your craft's motion and the controller to aim your weapon - that makes games like this MUCH more tolerable in VR, as the motion of your head better matches what your eyes are seeing, thus decreasing feelings of disorientation and nausea (I feel none whatsoever in Ashar Wars 2 and none in general on most VIVE games). If at all possible, PLEASE incorporate that as an alternate control scheme to make this game more accessible to a wider range of people, including myself.And as a side note, the game runs flawlessly on my system (GeForce 980 Ti x2 and core i7-5930 @ 4.0 GHz with a SSD on MSI Godlike board), so specs/settings have nothing to do with it. It is the disconnect between the visual stimulus and what the vestibular canals of the inner ear are sensing. Add the alternate control scheme I suggested, and it will be way more comfortable. ;)"

I've played a few flight sims and this one is the worst in terms of motion sickness... not sure how the devs can fix this without dampering the game play.Looks like fun with simple flight controls... but oh man the motion sickness kills it.   No attention to limiting the motion sickness has been taken into the game mechanics   ( I've developed a few games using Unity )  and this needs some serious upgrades.

Needs more maps, better sounds (no engine noises? really?) and as others have stated, this game is the roughest motion-sickness inducing game I've played in my month of oculus ownership (and I spend hours at a time in Elite: Dangerous. War thunder and DCS dont bother me either). Even in the planes with more of a cockpit (which are supposed to help cut down on sickness)I love the idea, and I'll definitely check back in a few updates"

O.o Even though you are tiny and only 2 meters above the ground you reaaaaaaally feel the heights! I recommend to fly the open cockpit planes if your stomach can handle it.I'm not a huge gamer anymore but VR has fascinated me and flying through a supermarket inside of a toy plane definitely made me think that I did the right choice. :DMy wife has tried it and was getting sick pretty fast so this experience is definitely for people who already have strong vr legs. I hope they continue with the regular updates so that this game gets better and better. :)
76561198208792612,Recommended,445860,24666398,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,Tummie555,"I have bought the Rift for racing games, together with my wheel and seat it's been a dream come true, but after a while I wanted to experience something more in VR. Got the space games Eve V and Elite D for free with the order, which are definitely alright, but it's not really my genre. Teased by all the ""demo-video's"" with dinasours and aliens, I tried lots of dfferent VR games and well, most of them are trash. It's either too obvious they don't have any budget backing them up, or there is just one developer, or it's been made in one month, etc.. Even AAA games converted with VorpX, they really aren't any good in VR. Like my little brother said; it is if a Chinese kid made this with cardboard and rubberbands, trying to accomplish a 3d 360 effect. It's all still very early days for VR on the Rift.Well now, none of that goes for my experience with this game, sure it's early access, so not yet a lot of content (levels), but this is by far the MOST FUN game I've had playing in VR. The basics, controls and overall presentation feel very solid and polished. I get lost easily for round after round. Normally I don't really like multiplayer only games, but you can select bot's to accompany you. Don't expect a flight simulator, it's more arcade than pacman, but dude this is magnificent! Keep it up guys!P.s. the motion sickness is the same for any flight game, you MUST learn to CONTROL the plane so your stomach knows which direction is going to happen. I've had no motion sickness with this game at all. (Note: I usually ain't bothered quickly by this effect. Roller coasters though... ; )."

,Recommended,445860,32327648,Posted: 10 June,all,GIBBED,"I really love this game.  It plays a lot like a cartoonish version of Descent.  With the appropriate options checked, you have 6 DOF when flying.  I like how you fly with the gamepad and shoot by looking.  I don't feel that motion controllers are appropriate for flying or racing games.  There is a lot of variety in the different airplanes (and helicoper), the cartoonish graphics work great (as in Rec Room), and the game feels very polished overall.Here are the things I would like to see as development continues:1.  More people playing because the game play is awesome and it feels like there's a very high skill ceiling.2.  More effect of gravity on the flight model.  Right now diving doesn't really increase your speed much.3.  The option to have open coms in multiplayer.  I love how in Rec Room you can talk with your opponents.Overall great game.  At $7.50 or $10.00 it's a great value."

Flying around a house as a miniature plane feels amazing. There are different game modes for you to fight in, from simple death matches to Capture the Flag.There is a campaign mode wich is fine and there are leaderboards for those highscore hunters among you.All in all a good game, even if i get sick after 30 minutes of play time. In my opinion: it's worth it."
