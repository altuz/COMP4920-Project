And thats great - because its Early Access!One thing to make clear that the store page sort of misleads - this isnota base-building game.The 'base-building' elements are simply leveling up your guys (as far as I have seen). There isn't really any management involved. The 'base-building' is another way to implement a skill tree. Its great, just know what you are in for.Essentially, you can hold two weapons at any given time, and are gun-blazing through randomly generated levels.Harder levels have more floors. After you complete a level, you return to your base to spend the loot to upgrade your guys. There are meta-game upgrades that really adds alot of replayability and keep you coming back.This feels like the best ofDoomIMO.Pros:+The FPS elements are done really well. Plays really smoothly and is hella fun. They keep it simple with only two weapons, which works very well here.+Pixel art is a mixed bag here - when its great its great, but some stuff needs further refinement (like walls and redundant posters, among other things).+Voice acting is good (but, I mean, who cares really - it could have just been left out given there is so little of it).+Its definately a cool new take on roguelites.+Music is definately good.+Its quite addicting!Cons:-Having randomly generated levels isn'talwaysa good thing. Yeah it adds 'infinite replayability', but in this case I'd rather have a good handful of crafted levels. They are all boring. Its just boxes connected by crappy hallways that the enemies have a lot of trouble path-finding through.-Environment needs a bit more detail. A bit more 'character'. Maybe better use of lighting. Everything feels like boxes connected by hallways at the moment.-The $15 price tag may be alittlesteep right now, but I definately will keep the game (which says something).Yeah, I am really enjoying the game, so far.I hope developement and refinement continues at a good rate."

Went on sale, and boy am I glad I bought it, really fun, even though I just started I know this is going to be a gem. Super tight controls, great music, really cool characters, and the bunker builing dynamic makes it just that much more fun.

A pleasure to play.The various mechanics and systems work together very well to make a surpisingly deep game  (once you have unlocked some items, etc.)The music is really great and makes the game feel even more intense.The characters, while not that fleshed out at the moment, are memorable and interesting.Item/character/bunker upgrade and unlock system is interesting.I personally find the graphics style to be really neat.Negatives:By far my biggest gripe is that it iswaytoo easy. Hopefully they will crank up the difficulty more or introduce several super hard modes at some point. At the moment I have 13 hours of playtime and only play on hard and I have never failed a run.Key rebinding doesn't seem to be avilable. A bit lacking in options in general really butluckily for me the all important 'invert Y axis' option is there.  (EDIT: rebinding now available)Needs more variety in enemies, maps, weapons, items, etc. (but this will probably get better as the game development progresses)Overall a really fun game, though. Well worth the low price!EDIT: I changed the review slightly to reflect my better undersdanding of the game."

The level design doesn't have much variety and the basebuilding is very barebones. I would love to see the combat and level desing have a bit more diversity.

,Recommended,446120,22150729,"Posted: 30 March, 2016",all,High Power,"Bunker Punks is a rogue like old school FPS that perfectly hearkens back to the old days of Doom and Wolfenstein with hints of RPG and management sim.This game had surprised me quite a bit when i first launched it. first things first when you launch the game you get placed into a character selection page where they have two punks for you to pick one female and one male, and to my amazement the characters both had voice acting. when choosing the male i was informed that I should not mess with Texas.moving further into the game it throws you into its FPS mechanics first and this is the meat of the game and it has kept me glued to the screen. gun play feels like Doom and the randomly generated dungeons you chose to go into remind me allot of the classic map design that Wolfinstein and Quake had.The combat is tight to say the least and its seems really, well, perfect for an early access title.The enemy's while not that interesting are fun to shoot. some fly in the air others are suicide bombers, while other robots act like attack dogs and come charging at you and that's only the start to the game. almost 5 hours in and I'm still finding new enemy's and special drops that your character can pick up throughout the dungeon to make your shotguns stronger or even your melee.This game is a blast to go through, especially with its amazing sound design and OST nothing beats running into a room full of enemy's with only 10 health left and the music just gets you going, it gets you going.after you are finished up with the dungeon you get thrown to your home base where you can unlock rooms and place anything you want in them like med rooms, or ammo rooms etc. It really feels like the developers wanted to make an old school shooter with some Xcom base customization sprinkled in.So far this game has impressed me and I cannot wait to see where these developers take the game from here.Pros:- Amazing representation of classic Shooters- Fast paced and challenging- AddictiveCons:- More variety"

76561198146674484,Recommended,446120,33015377,Posted: 29 June,all,LucaFox,"Do I recommend this game?Yesno. Or Noyes. Pick what you prefer.The game graphic is good pixelart. Gameplay is quite fun. There is a quite a bit of stuff you can unlock (mostly weapons and equipment). I like the music too. Character design actually is pretty good!BUT. I have to say but, and it's okay, because let's admit it, everyone is looking for buts in the review section. No pun intended, I swear.The levels feel... a bit too much all the same? The game is pretty short (even for a roguelite, imo), the challenge/difficulty parabola doesn't convince me too much (a little too much steep, again imo, should rise a little more gradually), and most of all, the most unconvincing part of the game is at the end: instead of throwing lots of new, nasty foes at you, there will be all the most powerful enemies you have encountered previously in the game and a couple of upgraded enemies... that really are the same as before but shoot faster or instead of firing bullets, they launch rockets. Things like that.That really makes you feel as you're playing a really poor-of-content, cheap indie.Considering how much simple the game is in matter of graphic and programming (just for info, I do have basic programming knowledge, I do know and make pixelart myself, and I do 3D graphic professionally), there are no excuses: everything is needed to fill this game with lots of level designs, varied rooms and textures, weapons, characters and amazing enemies is creativity and passion. Nothing else at all.Anyway, considering the game is in early access, I still recommend this game and I'm quite happy in supporting this project - but be aware of the fact that I wouldn't recommend it as a final product, right now.And if the points I discussed won't be improved in future, at least for what regards content, I will change this review and will discourage everyone in buying it. The game has great potential, but a lot of games have it, and very, very few are effectively developed enough."
,Recommended,446120,24602953,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,Yaridovich,"9/10Bunker Punks is a really fun roguelike game about rebels (the Punks) fighting against an authoritarian government. Gameplay consists of attacking bunkers (FPS sections) to acquire gear, credits and tech, then going back to base and using the collected credits to buy new rooms & room upgrades, which will then grant your characters bonuses. When a character dies, he/she gives a permanent bonus to other characters, and when all characters die, it's game over and you're taken to the marketplace, where you can use your collected tech to buy new Punks, gear, weapons, rooms, room upgrades, room slots and character slots.As the game is currently (July 29th, 2016), version 0.2.1, the game is still lacking in content, as it'd be expected of such an early version. But even then, I still had some good hours of fun with this - 9 hours registered right now, which were needed to unlock everything currently available. If at this current, early development state I was already able to have so much fun, I can only wonder how many hours I'd put into this once the full version is out.As it'd be expected of an early version of the game, there are a few issues, but only one is worth mentioning right now, which is an issue with enemy hitbox sizes. Sometimes, the aim reticle can be right on top of an enemy, but it still shows up as white (meaning the shot will miss).However, the dev is active and listening to player feedback, taking note of all issues reported and fixing them ASAP.Definitely a game worth supporting and recommending. Even as an early access title, I still recommend it at full price."

I completed the game in that amount of time, and I was playing slowly. It's a good early access title, because it's playable and enjoyable, but $15 is a lot to ask for six hours of content for a rogue-lite game. There are far better games in this genre out there that are completed. If you're a fan of dungeon crawlers, scifi, and rogue lites, a far superior early access title is Star Crawlers. Check that out if you like this. What they have is basically a full game.Verdict: Purchase ONLY if you want to support this developer. Otherwise wait, but do purchase it when it comes out if they've added about ten times the content. This is more of a demo than a game. That's fine for early access. They're doing early access right, even. This review is just to warn away people who are looking for a more robust experience, as we've seen from early access titles like Star Crawlers."

I'm happy with the game and would enjoy having paid full price after realizing how the game plays... I have to say the trailers for this game do it no favors at all, as the trailers try to depict some zany, ""Borderlands-esque"" sense of humor with that lame♥♥♥♥♥announcer, which isn't present in the actual game itself at all. It has some bugs with the UI after completing a level to be wary of, but if you're just looking for a stylish, frantic shooter / dungeon crawling type of experience in a sci fi, 8 bit aesthetic, this game has some amusing effects and enemies. The sound design and soundtrack -including what sounds like a sample of the ""Doom"" guy wincing on one track inparticular- are well done.There is a base building mechanic and you gather credits during levels, as well as various other stat boosts you can upgrade from the game's currency. There is a trading and selling system /marketplace camp of the seemingly limited items / guns available. Cool, my guy can smoke dudes with a shotgun, or the pistol... or rocketlauncher... but what can i do with these 5 guns other than just aim, strafe, and shoot??? Which is harkening to the game's roots (early FPS...?)  but I do wish there were some more customization with the guns ie scopes, larger magazines (I think a vest/gloves you can equip adds to ammo capacity...) I am playing the game as of it's 0.4 version (I believe) which I think saw a fair amount of changes to the pace of the game, but I do enjoy playing it overall and hope to beat the end stage of its frantic and at times overwhelming odds, but it's fun to blast dudes and dodge their  attacks down hallways.If the game doesn't have bosses (I'm hoping they are present as the end of the level/stage, but haven't made it that far...) I think implementing a sub-boss / mini boss system would benefit some of the redundancy that begins to emerge in some of the repeated combat encounters w/ dog type enemy, drones, cyborg, spider, etc...I encountered a bug a couple of times when finishing level and trying to press A on Xbox One while plugged in w/ USB, when hitting A on controller, if I didn't make sure to navigate w/ mouse at the elevator's UI screen to go to 'next level' then the game would occasionally hard lock, but it could be my end of things. The developer(s) seem really receptive to feedback and actively supporting their creation, to their credit, and I like the overall style and effects of the game. They responded already to this, and other people on the forums from what I've seen.If you like dungeon crawl / fast-paced, retro FPS combat with cool, frantic effects / explosions but don't mind somewhat repetitive environments/enemies/combat and limited locales, I think this is a fun FPS with loud guns / enemy effects and a cool, futuristic spy type setting / soundtrack, but I do wish it had ""one more thing"" to it in some ways (the ability to switch between characters during level? I don't know..) but what is here is cool."

Boy was i in for a treat! After playing for half an hour i realised that this was no ordinary shooter. You have different characters, who each have a unique passive ability, and a special move. They also have unique starter guns. The soundtrack is really good. I absolutely love it. The music goes with the fast combat of the game.Did I tell you there is no sprint button?Well, there is no need for a sprint button.You zoom around each floor (the level) with insane speed dodging and jumping over bullets. There are many, many types of enemies and they each have unique ways of attacking you. There are dog robots which charge at you and try to squish you, there are small drones which fly up to you and self destruct. There are more than that too!Not only does this game have great combat. There is also a base building aspect, albeit a small addition to the game but still a fun thing to do inbetween the levels.Have I mentioned how no level is the same yet?No level is the same.With the randomly generated levels this game has infinite replayability. You do not want to pass this game up. Finally, there is an almost RPG like system in the game, where you can collect different types of guns and armour. Each piece of armour has a stat boost for either a weapon, or even extra health from the pickups.Wait,I forgot something.There are different shops you can unlock, and new rooms for your base. Even when you die it isn't truly over. There is a currency you collect whilst playing, and when you die you can spend it to unlock new things in your next play through. This game is Great!If you dont get this,you are really missing out.I rate it 9.5 out of 10Brilliant gameBrilliant SoundtrackToo long reviewIf you read all of this, good for you.One last thing.For a game that is in early access, its better than some full games.Keep up he good work Devs!And thanks for a great game!"

I support you guys and I really care about your product. Here's what you've done that's great:-Art style-Voice acting-Sound quality-Game fluidityThose are great features to have and, overall, are the stuff of the greatest games on the market. Here is what I would like to see:1) Variations on the modular level design. I've come to appreciate the beauty that this game has to offer, but the modules can be multi-story with ladders and varied in shapes other than cubes.2) Secret rooms are a hallmark of both roguelikes and classic fps games. This would be a pleasant cherry on top. But that's up to you and only you.3) Level interactability. You could have some ""keycard"" mechanic on some of the larger levels.4) New AI. This is really the biggest turn-off of the game: many of the enemies camp doorways and track you almost immediately, even when the level begins. Here are some of the really frustrating problems that I feel can be easily fixed:-a) Enemies clip (get stuck) on corners. If this happens in a hallway, then this always works to the disadvantage of the player, no exceptions. The enemy cannot successfully navigate a clear path to the player until the player is within plain sight of the enemy. The player will always take damage from the enemy, and this cannot be countered. Not even explosives can counter this effect as explosive splash does not appear to wrap around corners. Maybe a cooldown for the enemy's pathfinding could alleviate this problem.-b) Often times the elevator door will open and you will have a room full of robots storm the door with devastating success. The only method that I have found to counter this is to always charge the room at the beginning of a raid, no exceptions.5) Controller support would be fantastic.6) It is unclear how the player can store items collected from a raid. Does the player have to finish an entire raid while wearing the accessory? Does she have to finish just one floor with it equiped? Just a small, in-game tip at the bottom-right corner of the start screen would be fabulous.Thank you, and good luck!"

Runs well on lower spec setups, and all setups for that matter.Disadvantages:1.)	Has very little enemy types, weapons, and gear.2.)	The items feel similar, because they all lack an ability besides “shoot things in the face”.3.)	Every floor feels the same, due to a lack of environmental differences.4.)	The random generation works, but leads to strange corridors.In its current state, I would say you could get about 10 hours out of it maximum. However, over time it will become more worth your wild."

A great potential, not a lot of content. As early access games go, this one has great promise. I just hope it is seen through to the end.If it were a finished game in its current state,  I'd give it a 6/10.As an early access game, I give it an 8/10.

The music and action meld together nicely to keep you engaged, but the content gets repetitive quickly.  It's also not very challenging. As others have mentioned, you can win on your first tries pretty easily if you have any talent at first person shooters. Maybe this game is best situated for players new to the genre, or are simply so-so at these kind of games. Others have related this experience to the old Doom games, and that is true to some extent... If you were to play Bunker Punks with the arrow keys and ctrl+alt+spacebar as I played Doom back in '95, then yeah, this game will be harder. As it is, mouselook/aim with high run speed make dodging the slow projectiles that the enemies of Bunker Punks employ criminally easy. If there were perhaps an extreme setting, where the enemies just automatically hit you after 'x' amount of time being in line of sight, then I could easily put in a lot more time to BP."

Love the voice acting and overall asthetic style of the game as well.The only downsides are some repetive level builds and vanishing loot (always a downside) but I understand that is speeds up the game a bit and throws the player into challenging situtaions.The ""level up"" style bunker builder is simple, clean and clever. I was doing so well in the game that I could never get upgrades - then I died and relized I could spend my hard-earned Tech on some new Punks, new Bunker upgrades and assorted new weapons. Problem is that you need to start all over. Oh well, new loadout time.I cannot wait to see the final version of this already fun game and I cannot wait to see more games from this dev."

I still love and play Doom to this day, and the shooting in this has a chunky Vlambeer feel to it which is satisfying, but my god, the art is absolutely atrocious. The randomly generated levels all feel exactly the same. There's no atmosphere at all, every location is shockingly ugly and samey, every enemy is incredibly boring to both look at and combat. The loot is tiresome and boring. There is no real inventory to manage. Every item is just ""This jacket gives you +5% damage for shotguns"" Wow. Yawn. Ultimately it ends up just feeling like Wolfenstein 3D, because the ""rogue"" elements do not impact gameplay to any noticable degree. It's just a thin layer of micro-boosts. The construction of your 'bunker' amounts to building a few rooms that are the same ""+5% to whatever"" crap that every other piece of loot is. Oi. Don't bother. I am mystified by the praise this game is receiving, but that's nothing new for steam."

I have beat the game once and unlocked all content from the first Tech vendor - I was surprised to see there was a second one with more content, but it seems to just add more weapons and things to tackle the same challenges. Hopefully there will be more levels/enemies in the future, especially since circle-strafing is kind of OP right now.2Tips: Tech can only be spent after you lose all your mans or beat the game; and the hireable guy who can ""stitch you up"" is actually a second tech vendor."

Note: I paid for the game myself & I am not affiliated with the developers. My opinions are my own.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5H_eGA_ViDwBunker Punks is a fantastic framework on which the devs plan to create an extremely fun rogue-like-like (rogue lite?). I bought Bunker Punks in probably the stupidest way. Impulsively. When purchasing games ESPECIALLY early access games one should always do thurogh research, and think before making a decision. Do I regret buying the game? No, but I regret how I bought it.Now more importantly how is Bunker Punks? It is an excellent framework. There are procedurally generated levels. Different types of enemies which scale and appear as you progress. The levels are random but there is an over arching world map (a la Mario 3) which gives you choice on your way to the end. There are 4 armor slots (head, chest, hands, & feet) and there are a variety of different sets which give varying different bonuses everything is mix and match as you choose. There are 5 different weapons(I assume they are weapons groups too but there aren't more weapons yet) they are: baseball bat(melee); pistol; shotgun; auto rifle; rocket launcher. Each weapon feels unique and requires different strategies for each. The weapons and armor that are in the game now work great and are fun; once a wider variety are added it's going to make the gameplay much more fun.This being a rogue lite (like-like) there is a meta game. Upon starting you pick a character(or more if you've unlocked them) and immediately enter a lever (I believe it's your base that your clearing out). Once cleared you arrive at your base. Here you can spend Credits that you find on enemies and boxes on leveling up your base. You can buy medical labs, firing ranges, and other buildings(modules). These modules can individually be leveled up. For example: one of the modules is the rifle range. Each level of this module gives +25% to rifle damage. The upgrades are quite valuable. Upgrades combined with appropriate armor bonuses can be awesome giving you + 100% damage or more! There is another collectible besides Credits and it is Tech. Upon the death of all of your characters you're sent back to the beginning (character selection). This is where Tech comes into play. You can spend the tech you've acquired on more characters, items, armor, modules, etc.If you're a fan of this genera Bunker Punks is a game to check out. Currently there is a very solid base game. If it was to never receive an update it wouldn't be worth the money. It would be too dull. However because the groundwork has already been laid the updates should come relatively easily. The devs don't need to build fundamentals but rather add all the fun stuff. Perhaps don't buy it quite yet. Unless you're prepared for the plausibility that this game is abandoned. Definitely add it to your wish list or follow it because soon enough this game is gonna be really freaking awesome!!!!"
,Recommended,446120,23806321,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,Reset Level 1 Nurse,A fun retro shooter with alot of clasic circle strafing. only really need to use the rifle or the shotgun as they seem to be a lil OP compared with the pistol rocket launcher. The only othe weapon I have seen is the baseball bat however due to the mechanics of the game theres not much point of it. The levels although randomly generated can seem to just look and feel very similar very quickly. Also it seems that when a character dies they give their buffs to the rest of your team somehow incentivising you to kill you members to get 1 or 2 very buffed members.Eaither way very fun and would be nice to see the clothing you pick up to be seen on your character during the base and in the elevator.

Graphicswhise it pays tribute to the early days of 3d gaming but it fits and positively sustains the simple gamplay mechanics. There is no zoom or ironsights just cirlestrafing and quick aiming against ever increasing numbers of enemies.Each level consists of a number off floors which the player has to clear in order to finish the level and get to safety. If you die, you have to start over again and lose all your progress. Throughout the levels you can collect different loot which is either weapons, types of armor, money (used for upgrading the stats of you character as long as s/he is alive) and tec-credits (which can be spent on permanent improvements for the upcoming games at the end of you characters life). Upgrading your stats is fun and adds a little resouce management character to the game.However there is still room for improvement. Music is a bit repetitive. I hope they add more tracks to the different levels, same goes for the graphic design. It would add more individuality to the various locations you visit. Another good idea would be to make the overworld map so that you can only advance towards the final goal without visiting all levels. This way you would need to make choices which loot you need the most and therefor decide where to go next.The verdict: Solid straight forward shooter, if you love Quake, Doom an the like, definitely give it a try. If you grew up with more modern shooters (COD, Battlefield), you might still like it and get it on a sale."

For $5, though, you can get Ziggurat, a similar roguelike twitch shooter which has better enemy variety, progression, responsiveness, weapons, and playable characters.Difficulty is way too easy, upgrading the bunkers seems extremely sparse for now, providing plain stat boosts (hopefully that will improve as the game moves towards version 1.0.0), and you get pigeonholed into using the same weapon all the time fairly quickly (the weapons aren't very exciting either, there's only 1 of each weapon type as far as I've experienced). I do appreciate the soul that went into this game (some of the in-game posters made me smile), even if I found the soundtrack a bit grating, but as a consumer I'd have to say take your $5/$15 and spend it on Ziggurat instead, because it's a very similar game with much more content in it."

The added perk of stringing together combos to heal yourself while you're in the field is the real golden egg behind the design. Forcing yourself to either stagger your opponents health to kill them all systematically, bathe your opposition in explosives to drop them evenly, or use a high stopping power single-shot weapon to push them all down one by one; is fun and rewarding, especially after a heavy melee of angry red bullets flying at your face.I'm really happy I jumped on Early Access for this title, it's extremely fun.

Two currency system is also great idea.+ Even in current 'Early Access' state this game is solid, (almost?) free of bugs and definitely playable.UPDATE: I've finished the game in its current (2016-04-20) pre-release state, and it was awesome!"

You earn credits like it's your day job, learn where to hit and how to not get hit, and generally experiment with all kinds of upgrades. But then you meet your first Titan, and expect to sacrifice a punk or five as he soaks up entire boxes of rockets and shoots grenades as a standard action. The turrets get stronger, the targets get longer. That corporate brain trust sparks a synapse, and suddenly you're fighting multiple giant robot dogs that spit out smaller suicide robot dogs while a symphony of bullets whirs around your ears. If you do not treat every mission like it could be your last, it may very well be your character's last.The true secret of the game is the FIVE different playstyles hidden behind what seem like slight variations of weapons. Melee forces you to soak bullets, but forces the RNG in turn to spit out the good stuff. Shotguns are devastating even in mid-range combat if you have good reflexes and better dodge. Rocket launchers and grenades have to be used sparingly, but they will clear out the hordes of charging morons that are common in all situations. Assault Rifles are for the average player, offering a high accuracy and healthy ammo drain in all situations, if you can last long enough to get the damage in. Pistols can go to hell, though. Master at least two different styles, and you've got it made... on easy mode. Then prepare to die again when Normal difficulty whomps your♥♥♥♥♥Smarter than it looks, but just dumb enough to be comedically violent fun."

Overally the developer seems to care and address things as well.There have been some rough bugs, but it looks like the developer will patch them quickly.Overall it's worth playing for people who like FPS games with some progression."

After a couple of hours play I can say that there are still a few issues with the game but not when it comes to performence.If you want a pretty braindead run, clear, dodge and aim game. Then you can do much worse then this game.The rouge-lite progression seems very basic but functional for as little I played. Gear is also very simple and very build oriented. As in if you running shotgun you should go for riot gear to get shotgun bonus.The issues is really minor but for someone like me pretty important. Lack of vsync in options is maybe the biggest. But forcing vsync off in drivers and prerendering down to one frame makes the game responsive as it should be. Vsync can make even the simplest game feel sluggish. But now I have no problems running the game with fps in the hundreds.Second biggest thing that might kill you a few times is the games weird choice of spawning nades/rockets very off to the right instead of more center screen. Ending in a lot of corner dodging resulting in selfdamage.But the issues are minor and there is always hope for tweaks. As of this moment I will recommend the game for those seeking this kind of gameplay.--- Old Review Bellow ---I do like the concept and I bought it for next to nothing. I will still refund it because the game runs so bad it is unplayable.Sure I don't have an awesome computer but let's face it. This game doesn't need it. So when the fps barely get to 50 and hovers just below 30 in an empty room it results in an unplayable game.The input lag that most likely is for the greater part caused by the low FPS makes aimign in this game feel like you have your arm in a bucket of sardines. You really don't like it and it is uncomfortable as hell.Maybe I'll give it another shot in the future. I am definitely one of the target audience for this type of game. But for now it is just unplayable."
