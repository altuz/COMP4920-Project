For the most part, i think someone should be able to judge how they are going to feel about a game based on the general description of the game and its overall reception. Most people, i think (including myself), even if they look at reviews, go into the reviews with a certain disposition towards the game one way or another and tend to discount the reviews that dont already side with their own pre-formed opinions.This game is uniquly special though.As there are not a lot of good, modern text based games these days, at least that i know of, i feel the need to review Sabres of Infinity.This might be one of the best games i have ever played.If Sabres of Infinity was 19.99, i would tell every one of my friends to buy it.There are plenty of books that cost 10-20 dollars, and this is essentially an amazing book that you get to be a part of.The writing is amazing, and while i usually hate games that force me to play as a specific person (i love to create my own original character) this game makes you truely feel the pressures of the role you must undertake, and it makes you enjoy it.Its quite a respectable length, especially for its price, and they choices you make all feel like they have weight and influence over the course of your story. I have only finished one playthrough, so im not 100% how much can change, but it seems like there are a lot of different options, and i have already seen several choices that i made that i know caused certain decisions later down the line to either succeed or fail.If you are someone who has played games like Baulders Gate, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Kotor 1-2 (#Bioware Fanboy) and the best part of those games was the story, dialogue, and decision making, you WILL enjoy this game. Its not quite the same as any of those, because obviously there is no ""Combat"" or controlling your character on a screen, but the decisions are just as real.It is a deeply immersive and well described and drawn out world, with characters that feel real, where every choice you make feels like the most important choice of the game. For the quality of content you get, compared to the price of the game, they are basically giving this out for free, because i would pay a hell of a lot more for this game than they're asking. 10/10, Im off to buy Guns of Infinity"

Highly recommended.I own Sabres of Infinity on the Chrome web store and have read through it at least a dozen times. It's been an inspiration for myself to get involved with writing, and has reinforced my love for the historical fiction and historical fantasy genres.Now, if you are expecting a visually grandiose game to play, perhaps Sabres is not for you, but if you enjoy deep storytelling and reading well-flowing prose, then you should definitely pick this one up and at least give it a chance. Interactive Novels are a slowly growing market, there's more and more coming out each year, and this one belongs on top of the pile of must-reads."

I won't say anything about the plot and let it be for you to discover. Suffice to say the military atmosphere has been completely respected, the different plots are well done and there is great replayability.One thing that bugs me though :- ""choose your own adventures"" games are always about maximising some stats and use them correctly in battles. Once the pattern has been discovered, it lose some of its charms. However the game is still able to make the mechanics behind it plausible.Still, a gem for the price. 9/10Would like the possibility to save for an upcoming title.

You play as a Junior Officer in a cavalry regiment in a fictional world resembling ours in the early to mid 1800's, but where Germany has apparantly been replaced by an Elven Nation, and the rest of Europe appears united against, what I deduce to be Slavic nations.There even appears to be some reference to Colonial America in some of the provinces held by the European-Equavialent nation.The technological is prior to the invention of revolvers and proper artillery platforms.The game features minor magic - all nobility in the game are referred to as ""bane blooded"" who have the innate ability that they are sensitive to magic. Some can even cast spells through runes, used for healing and killing on the battle field, as well as forging magical weapons and armor.Banecrafted armor and weapons are very rare in the world though - reserved for particularly elite soldiers and Knights of the Red order.Banecasters are also fairly rare - only on few occasions do they become relevant in the actual game.The game is continued in a Sequel called Guns of Infinity, and your save-file can be transferred.I was disappointed that certain choices leave very little impact in the game, and other choices leave no impact at all - where as it often seems to be some of the more unlikely choices that seem to have lasting impacts.There is a balance act to the game, but ultimately your story will always be different depending on your chocies, which is very interesting.I can't wait for the third installation."

It is a game such I've not seen since the 1980s, text only, no graphics, just a story with many options.However, said story is very good, and genuine choices you make effect the outcome later. This is not a game for someone who doesn't like to read or to get into military details. However, if you liked Sharpe, Hornblower or other such adventure war stories of that era this will go well for you.The biggest downside is the lack of a proper save system - play this all in one go as there's little option to go back unless you die.Overall, very satisfying for its low price.

The main negatives I would point out is that choices do not usually affect the story as a whole, only your standing in it. It is also debatable as to how much effect this has. And some choices seem to be mandatory to prevent an early end, however much some do not make sense to me that I will avoid mentioning due to spoilers. The biggest complaint I have is the consistent negative nature before your character, although I enjoy bleak scenarios and the idea of a steady climb up the ladder of command, nonetheless your gallantry seems to be all but ignored at most points. However, if you can get in the feel of the story and enjoy such negativity this is the game-book for you.

Though I have yet to play as a coward or, simply, the juxtaposition of myself, in which the seemingly most stupid decision is taken. One day, perhaps I shall, if only to see where it takes me - other than death.In regards to the lack of Decorations, perhaps I am simply playing a longer game than in necessary, in that where I could not myself decide on a course of action, I was guided by the simple question: 'What would Raj Whitehall do?'
