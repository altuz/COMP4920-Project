Fantastic atmosphere, both visually and aurally...very tense...but is it LOGICAL?!Firstly, there's the usual ""you've been given a really, really super-dangerous job for next-to-no pay"" premise...so in spite of them never clearly stating as such, I'm assuming that all of these post-FNAF games are set in third world countries, where life is cheap and you'd basically murder your grandmother for spare change.  I mean, I accepted the premise of the first Five Nights at Freddy's as much as anyone, but the sixtieth time around this kind of set-up is pushing its luck just a tad, don't ya think?Secondly, I do everything the game tells me to.  Run here to stop generator A, B, C, or D from running down, solve (admittedly well-done) mini-puzzles at the laptop when required, and try my best to hang around in the designated ""safe-spot"" for the rest of the time (quite how the laptop knows the exact place in the house to stand to avoid ghostly victimisation I have no fricking idea, but I'm happy enough to accept that I know ♥♥♥♥-all about modern technological capabilities).  And STILL I die, again and again and again.  I don't know WHY I do, but I do.  There's a bit in the game's instructions which says something about Sophie occasionally attacking because she simply ""doesn't like you"".  Well, apparently she ♥♥♥♥ing HATED ME, because she assailed me left, right, and centre.  No reprieve.  No logic.  Just sudden, random, rampant doom.Don't get me wrong, I actually quite liked this one.  There's something at least slightly more assured about it than the likes of, say, Emily Wants to Play.  But I'm getting a bit sick of this recent run of horror games where sheer, dumb-arsed LUCK seems to play such a large part in how long you survive before the next fatal ""jump-scare"" comes your way.  I'm sure a plethora of fan-boys and fan-girls will slap up guides in no time, telling me what you have to do at each and every different hour and blah-blah-blah, but unless I can actually work this♥♥♥♥♥♥out for myself, it's not exactly LOGICAL, is it now?I honestly look forward to all you people proving me wrong, at which point I'll revise this review and the below-given rating.  Please, tell me how my faculties are flawed, and by that I don't mean write♥♥♥♥♥♥like ""dude, everyone knows that 11pm is the time when Sophie attacks you if you hang around too long at generator C"", because unless the game clearly tells me this, IT ISN'T LOGICAL.  Please, thumb me down and tell me I'm wrong, but also tell me WHY I'm wrong.  Hell, even the first FNAF plays reasonably fair for at least the first few nights, but this game gave me almost no delusion of ""control"" over my fate whatsoever.I've played a LOT of horror games in my time.  And almost all the ""old"" ones - I'm even talking up to Outlast and Alien: Isolation here! - give you sufficient indication of what you have to do to survive, then the rest is up to you.  This super-recent, post-FNAF breed of game seems to believe that &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥happens"" can pass for good game design.  I beg to differ.  Having said all this, I think the dev of this game shows tremendous potential, he just needs to emulate a better - nay, FAIRER - kind of game in future.This is far from the worst of its species, but it's also not the best, and until someone (including Scott Cawthon himself) makes a game as good as Freddy's the first, we really should just put a cork in all games of this type for the time being, whad'ya say?  (Or failing that, ♥♥♥♥wits like me could just stop buying them, haha.)  Looking forward to that veritable assault of ""tips"" from all you super-savvy fan-persons out there...Verdict: 6.5/10.UPDATE: Well, here we are a bit over a month later, and credit where credit is due...this dev has laboured long and hard to give the gaming public a much improved experience.  And, I'm pleased to say, he's MOSTLY succeeded.  We now have two difficulty levels - though the easier of the two is still much too hard in my humble opinion - and while the ""random"" death element has been ostensibly removed, and ""cheap"" deaths are far less common, I still can't help but feel that there are moments when you're damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't, and I certainly still feel that save-points are too few and far between (once every hour would be more than challenging enough, especially for the allegedly ""easy"" version of the game).  Whichever way you look at it, I'm happy to concede that this is by far one of the best games of its type - i.e. the some-strategy/some-luck/jumpscare-game-with-minimal-mechanics sub-genre - though it would appear that the first Five Nights at Freddy's is destined to remain the king of its kind.  As with that game, however, I'm probably destined to never find the nerve and/or patience to fully ""beat"" this one, but in light of the dev's improvements I'm more than happy to adjust my rating to read (drum roll, please):REVISED VERDICT: 7.5/10.SECOND UPDATE: Well, I gotta hand it to Eddie the dev...after the initial doubts of myself and many other reviewers, he's worked long and hard at this little game of his, and he's finally managed to make it fair to the point where even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ likes of yours truly can now complete the darned thing (granted, on the easiest difficulty)! I'm now willing to go on record and state that this is, in my opinion, a rival for the second-best game of its type, after the first Five Nights at Freddy's. Congrats, sir, and I hope you get some kind of Dev of the Year award for this commendable effort. ♥♥♥♥ing good game...finally.RE-REVISED VERDICT: 9/10 (by far the biggest score hike I've given a game...EVER)."

To me it has a good level of immersion over games like FNAF while maintaining a similar concept.I felt the tension and the anxiety especially as the clock grew closer to the checkpoints, but what I didn't feel was purpose or intrigue.It seems like a challenge game.  ""Can you beat it?,"" is the question it asks you.  If you like to conquer things then this game is for you.  To me games are something to explore but beyond the first hour I don't see what this game has to offer people like me.Games like FNAF keep your interest by offering new challenges as it progresses but this game just seems to become more difficult without changing.  Is that bad?  No, certainly not but it just doesn't hit me as a customer.Up your narative, vary your gameplay, and offer me something to figure out and I'd be happy to try out another one of your games, TrerPlay.  Good job, don't take this negative review too personally.This was my experience:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBd4U3msXn8"
,Not Recommended,446380,32310295,Posted: 9 June,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"The paper-thin story of Sophie's Curse is that you're a nurse who has landed a small time job providing at-home care for your friend's grandfather for one night. Since he has just moved in to his new house, instead of putting up real lighting for some reason he lugged four of these power generator lights into the home. It's your task to keep them all going, and for some spoopy paranormal reason, the lights like to lose their charge often. Don't worry, though, your friend says he'll pay you extra for this hassle.At its very best, Sophie's Curse is a sub-par Five Nights at Freddy's clone. At its very worst, it's abhorrently atrocious. The gameplay is done in the same style as FNAF, where you click to traverse from one area to the next. There's an abysmal HUD that lets you know which light is losing power, and you go from light to light all night long, winding them back up again while avoiding Sophie. Who is Sophie? F**k knows! You get tidbits of the story here and there through instant messages if you open the laptop in the kitchen, which is used to fix generator errors with half-hearted mini-games, but who has time to read that crap when this entity could jumpscare you at any moment?Basically, if you run in to Sophie, you have to run the other way if you're not in the designated safe zone, which can also be seen on the laptop. By the way, this safe spot only moves after checkpoints and when Sophie knocks the lights out, and you can't die while you're standing in it, so it kinda defeats the purpose of doing much else. At least it would, if the rules of the game didn't change constantly. Even if you are in the safe zone, Sophie likes to just randomly pop up with no warning and kill you. On the other hand, if you happen to see her and if you don't immediately go in the opposite direction she'll do the same; but at least that's as it should be. There are checkpoints placed at 2 hour intervals throughout the one-night stay at this guys house, and you must last the entire night from 6pm until 6am.Sophie's Curse is just bad. It barely has any play value, let alone replay value; although it does have two difficulties, ""Curse"" and ""Nightmare"". The majority of positive reviews are very suspicious, and the hate that negative reviews like this one garner is even more reason to raise a red flag. The game is nowhere near being worth $5.49 CAD, it's closer to a $1.09 game such as Francisca. Sophie herself isn't even scary, being the cliché grey-skinned, eyes-ripped-out stereotype from a lot of modern horror movies, but when she appears out of nowhere, with zero warning, it's absolutely ridiculous.*The amount of people who are passionately defending this game by using derogatory remarks toward reviewers is incredibly weird.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

As long as I was careful and didn't mash my mouse in a panic, I could avoid Sophie.All in all, I really enjoyed this game and the challenge of moving seamlessly through the house solving puzzles. It got chaoic every once in a while, but that is the point of the game.One complaint though my darlings. When you beat the game the music track after the big reveal is really short so it loops. Not a big deal really, but I could hear where it looped(it makes a clicking sound) and it caused me to take longer to read the 'epilogue' because it was a little distracting.Two snaps and a clap, I'd happily buy a sequel at full price."

After the first few checkpoints, things got more frustrating because I didn't get one part of the game: what to do whenever the gurgling-like sound would happen. I would stop and not look around, I would keep cranking, all those things and Sophie would still get me. But I still finished it and would definitely recommend this game. One thing I would add is the option to see Henry's notes after you checked them before. Maybe a menu option to see notes the player has already gathered, or something like that. Just to see story as a whole after one has completed the game/checkpoint because I know I may have skipped one or two.Check out my channel or this playlist to see it for yourself! 9/10, would recommend.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLucQ3P8DHvktQy6b93BdfEDlNHHdKh410"

There's a lot of tension and getting ready for a jumpscare and the jumpscare itself is good.  However, I found myself walking through the game up to 12am and only lost because the I was using the computer when the system crashed and within a split second of the scren going down Sophie jumped me from zone A and never stood a chance.  Second jumpscare was when I went downstairs and immediately got jumpscared as she was standing over by B.  I'm now all the way up to 2:30am but only played 40 minutes of the game.  I'm not sure if the game gets harder or not but it seems like the win/lose is based on random luck being caught out by mechanics like above which I have no chance of avoiding.  The youtubers made this look and feel harder than it actually is though I read that there has been some work on the game probably since they played it.  I also have a bit of trouble identifying where to click.  While there is a tutorial at the start I wasn't sure if I could flick the camera to turn or to just click there and where was clickable if I could.I had another go and got to just after 3am and once again the instant the system started shutting down I got jumpscared.  The only times I'm getting jumpscared is when I literally can't avoid it so on the one hand it's super easy but on the other it's annoyingly difficult and frustrating.  One problem I have with the mechanics (though not a bug) is this;  When the power goes down you go to wind them up but as the night goes on the system crashes more and more.  Provided that you can get through the crashes the system literally reboots itself for you and this looks to happen more and more frequently meaning it's more the challenge of surviving the crashes and making sure none of the lights go out.I can tell the game is getting harder but within an hour of playing I feel like I'm going to beat this game too easily and the only way I won't is jumpscares I have no way of avoiding.  This game has lots of potential buti it has some issues which I hope I've given constructive feedback on and hope it helps make a better game.  Can't say whether to recommend this game or not it's hard to say....I can't submit otherwise so I'd say...no but for people to watch this space and wait for the issues to be ironed out.  All the best, there definitely potential here.  Maybe more backstory or lore to the game would be good as well."

If you don't mind the so-called ""cheap"" (which I honestly find kind of fun) jump scares, there really isn't anything to regret. I played it on my YT channel (I know, LAME) and it's clear that I had fun with it. My only complaint is that there is too much left to chance. There IS a technique to the game, but it only goes so far. I do still play the game and enjoy it, so, yes, I would recommend it. My biases toward the game, though, include the fact that the graphics remind me of early CGI cut-scenes in PC games like Beyond Atlantis, Myst, Raven and Crystal Key and that I love horror games in general. That being said, don't expect perfection. However, the game may not seem learnable at first, but there are definitley techniques and processes to playing the game, for the most part. That doesn't seem to totally eliminate the random eliments to the game, though, as far as I can tell. But, yes, for $5, it's a fun game to have in your library."

The lights in this house are powered by a crank that needs to be manually turned to re-generate as they loose power over time, or are interfered with by Sophie.While it uses FnaF like mechanics I really enjoy that you ""walk"" around the house to different rooms, rather than being in a single room. It is not open roaming like Emily wants to play but instead clicking areas on the screen makes you walk to different rooms.You only have to survive a single night but the night is divided into sections of 2 hours. Each 2 hours you survive will save that checkpoint to continue from.Your Job is to ensure that the lamps keep staying bright by manual turning the handles on their generators to replenish their power. There is 4 lights, 2 downstairs and 2 upstairs, with 1 randomly being chosen to the be a ""savepoint"" when thinks get hairy.As you progress through the night things get more frantic with each checkpoint with lamps not only loosing power but starting to fail completely needing you to use your laptop in the kitchen to re-activate them and solve additional tasks to do so.Listen out for queues to know when to stop powering lights, run away from Sophie when she comes for you and hope she likes you :)The developer did add a guide with a few tips here:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=647150959I enjoyed my first attempt playing this game very much as you can see below and I'm looking forward to more.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dFcU8ErsQE"

The atmosphere is very dark and it has a great sense of urgency and fear of the unknown. At first, I thought the scenary was a little too dark, but this actually proved to be perfect as it gave that feeling of dread.I love how it's interactive: You have the choice of surviving.I love the mechanics and atmosphere.There is only one thing I would say to make this game better, and that is to include more sound cues to make the feel or horror even stronger. Perhaps some footsteps...spooky laughter...glass shattering..With all of this being said, I love this game and I even took the pleasure of making a let's play for your game in hopes that it may get the recognition it deserves.Hear it is.
