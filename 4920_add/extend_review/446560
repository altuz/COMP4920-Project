,Recommended,446560,26251625,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,D-Dog,"I think I am the first person to leave a review on this in English, so I better make it good.Historically, we have enjoyed a bit of competative time on Just Dance on the Wii at family events like Christmas. It is always a good laugh, especially with a drink or two. The team dances where you accidentally nudge eachother with the remotes or trip over one another, are particularly entertaining for the audience.Just when you think you are starting to get the hang of the dance, the moves of the song imply you are supposed to be facing one another, and you realise that your best mate is doing something completely different to you.When it comes to this version of Just Dance, on the PC, I am actually quite impressed at how seamless the integration is with the phone is. It seems to pick up the movements very well with little latency. My computer is plugged in to my router, and my Samsung Galaxy S7 works really well with the app over Wifi. (I am yet to try this on a lower-end device such as a Lenovo Warrior). The game also pulled trick on me whereby it managed to record me 'dancing' to the very first song I tried with the camera. I hadn't realised that this nifty feature existed until it played back some of my moves at fast pace at the end of the dance.*I haven't come across any bugs for this game, but I ought to let you know that it doesn't work with triple monitors (in case you were wondering). Also, an nvidia 1080 can definitely run it at 1080p with 144 fps.A downside for me is that in the 'About this Game' section it mentions a 3-month trial, yet I never received this trial to the Just Dance Unlimited.EDITED 28/10/16 18:47: I logged back into the game today, and it appears that as a result of getting in touch with Ubisoft Support, I have been given the 92 days of Just Dance Unlimited subscription promised in the description of the game. I have counted, and the number of songs that come with the game is 41, but there are aditionally skinned variations of the same songs on top of that.The Just Dance Unlimited service seems to work quite well, but it does appear to download the songs as and when you choose to play them for the first time. Being on a relatively fast fibre connection does mean that loading times were minimal and almost look like the game is just taking that little bit longer to load, so they are disguised quite well, but you do sometimes get met with a low res rendering of the song at first while it plays catch-up with the loading."

ProfitThe app works well as long as you don't hit your family in the head while you are playing and drop your phone.My advice is to play on carpet and hold on tight.Ended up buying a 12 month subscription to Unlimited the day I got it because I had that much fun dancing around my room like a total moron.Wish there was a few more new songs but a small sacrifice for a game that keeps you entertained for hours.The app makes it easy for everyone to play because who doesn't have a smart phone these days.First day I played my sister came in for a while and had a go, this morning it was my sons turn. I can see this will become a regular family event now in this house."

A friend of mine got the game for Christmas and I'd go hang out with him every day and we'd play until we were too tired to even move.Not being a fan of consoles, I hadn't played any dancing games in a few years until today. I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when I saw Just Dance 2017 on the Steam store, I thought maybe it'd require VR or something, so I went to check and nope, just my phone and my PC.Installing the app on my phone was pretty easy, it's a download of about 75Mb. I downloaded the app, followed the instructions and everything connected with no problems at all. The only minor issue I had was that nothing told me to log in to my Uplay account on the phone, so I played through a few songs on a default account and didn't get any progress on my Uplay account, but that is frankly not a problem as I'll be playing those songs again for sure!I'm not sure why so many people are having issues with the free 3 months of of Just Dance Unlimited. As soon as I was done making my profile, it activated the 92 days and I instantly had access to all of the songs available.The game itself is incredibly colorful. At first I thought it may be too much and make it difficult to concentrate on what the dancer on the screen is doing, but they actually make them ""come out"" or contrast a lot compared to the backgrounds, and I've had no issue whatsoever following.I really love the song choices, of course there's over 200 of them and I haven't had the chance to try them all yet, but so far I've got to say I'm very pleased. Even some songs that I wouldn't usually listen to, I've had a lot of fun dancing to, simply because the choreography is well made and fun to follow.I played 7 songs in a row and I must say, I am currently covered in sweat. I'm not going to lie I'm not in incredible shape, but I wasn't expecting such a workout from this game. Most of the songs I played made me jump around and move pretty much every part of my body!Long story short, if you're a fan of dance games, buy it! I haven't had this much fun in years!"

Even works with steam link and I have it setup to a 65"" 4k completely wirelessly and don't experience any input lag. If you're looking for a good party game or something to get your lazy bum off the chair, get this game.Just Dance Unlimited feature isn't the greatest thing since it's subscription based, but it's not the end of the world."

,Recommended,446560,28938611,Posted: 2 January,all,Frances Picard,"Pros :- One of few games in Steam that makes you do workout instead of sitting all day.- Many selections of songs (about 50 built-in + more than 200 from Just Dance Unlimited).- The respond and accuracy is very good (better than Just Dance Now).- You can pay for Just Dance Unlimited subscription either from Credit Card or Steam Wallet (I like the latter option, since I don't have credit card). The subscription price is more or less same than Just Dance Now subscription price.- Many modes, so pretty high replayability (apart from that many songs selection).- Full control of smartphone (no need to use keyboard).- Up to six or eight player (assuming they have smartphone for each player).- 11 Uplay badges (most of Uplay games only have 3 badges).- Playable even on my GT540M laptop (no need to focus on this game's system requirement). Intel IGP devices may not supported.Cons :- Limited screen resolution (especially if you use non-standard laptop resolution such as 1366x768). No setting for this one, so you either choose 720p or 1080p (idk about any other resolutions beyond 1080p). Disregard this thing if you intend to play on your external monitor with 1080p support.- Minor bugs if you play Just Dance Unlimited songs with slow internet connection.Tip :- If you have dual graphic card (especially Intel and nVidia), make sure you set it to run with your nVidia. You must do this manually (as time of this writing), otherwise your game will crash because the game will try to run on your Intel.- If you have smartphone with x86 architecture and seeing blackscreen after Ubisoft logo, try to press back button.My personal rating : 9,6/10 (Best Workout Game at Steam)."

But at first I'm dissapointed because I can't play the game because I have a problem with the app before, but after updating my OS into lollipop and do factory reset, the app works like magic! and I can play this game now. Overall this game is different than other music game when you get up and follow the coach and dance hehehe, and because this game, I can do dance too.So, before you buy this game, try the app first. If the app works fine with your phone (I mean the button on the main screen are touchable), I'm sure the game will detect your phone too and works fine."

With a jealous pang I sometimes visited a friend who had these consoles, including needed accesories and the actual games. I always wished that apart from wiggling around after a drink in someone else's living room, surrounded by other people, I could do this alone in my own space. And voila here is finally the game that actually does that for me without having to buy accesories for my boyfriend's console and steal away his game-time.I was a bit skeptical at first, seeing some of the other reviews, and wondering wether it would actually work with my phone. But it was on discount so worth trying. Installation on pc and phone went quick, connected to the same wifi and it synched before i even knew it. In fact it was so much fun, and functioned so well, that I worked a sweat dancing five songs in a row. Mission accomplished.The only difficulty was that my phone locked halfway through the first song, but just had to watch how I held it. I can see that since it only monitors the movements of the right hand, you could as well sit down and move your arm. But then what's the point?I'm very happy that finally this is possible on pc, actually working seemlesly and very inviting to just dance and have fun :)"

I've bought every version that's come out since then. This series has given me such a huge boost to my health and self-esteem. Clubs and dance parties aren't scary anymore because I can actually pull out quite a few dance moves (and keep the party going!). I never realize how fun working out was until I found this game. I go to the gym now but I still play this game when I don't feel as motivated or don't have as much time. I would eventually love to see Kinect-compatibility with this game, but I actually like this version more than I thought I would!"

I also love the song selection it has and that it came with a couple days access to Just Dance Unlimited, which is some subscription service for more songs.Take note it only uses a mobile phone as a controller. It doesn't track your feet at all, so you can just stand still and do the hand gestures and still get Perfect. I didn't have any issue with phone connections.But I seem to be having issues with HDMI:- If I start the game with the HDMI cable already attached to my laptop, its just white screen. But you can hear the audio so you know the game is running.- If I start the game first then attach the HDMI cable, it works. But if the game is set to Full Screen, it switches to Windowed mode and I can't seem to change it at all even when selecting Full Screen in the Options menu.- If I disable my laptop's speakers and set the HDMI (TV) Audio as the default audio playback device, the game crashes or does not open. So I had to instead attach a 3.5mm cable from my laptop to my sound system.If you're fine with all those possible issues and your love of dance games still outweighs everything else, then feel free to buy it.Wish they'd make use of Kinect in PC or webcam though.

You mimic the dancing from your chosen avatar.  If you have a camera on your PC, you can see a recording of a snippet of your dancing.  You can also take photos from your phone dance controller.  You have to have UPlay to activate.The scoring from the phone app is less than stellar.  You will get OKs and won't be able to tell why, even if you think you did the move perfect.  You're limited to seeing dances and challenges from other PC users (there's no crossplay).  You can like players dances or do their dance challenges.  You can also upload your own.Also, the kinect does not work on PC other than as a webcam.  That's really a shame.

Jumping as well.Pros:-Rather fun (Imo)-With Just Dance Unlimited, HUGE selection of songs.-Three month trial of JDU (I'm REALLY surprised it's that long honestly.)-Absolutely Great workout (I'm going to be sore af in the morning...)-Entertaining backgrounds while not being too distracting. They did a really good job with that.Cons: (There's not many big cons honestly)-Only 44 songs on the game itself...

If anyone knows how to relist the unlimited songs, please add me and let me know."

It is a fun game that needs you to kinda believe that all your dance moves are being monitored and scored rather than just the the movement of the controller being tracked.Bought this game because the description and reviews convinced me this was a completely new version which used all the tech in your mobile phone to somehow track your funky dance moves more accurately. I would have been impressed if it worked like that.In fact the 2017 PC version is, fundamentally, no different to the original Just Dance other than being alot flashier. The single controller tracking remains the same, only now the controller can be your phone.The fun can still be had by going along with the whole dancing thing but, for me, it's just an expensive version of the Wii game I already own.Perhaps, if you don't have a games console, you may have fun with Just Dance 2017.Not for me though. Gonna seek a refund now."
