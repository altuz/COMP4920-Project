If you want a great shooter, this is the one to get - the feel of the shooting rivals H3VR, even though it is cartoon zombies - the graphics, especially when it comes to the iron sights is crystal clear which makes it a lot more realistic to aim properly than in most other VR shooters I've tried so far. I've been in the military for over 20 years now, so I have some experience firing guns, and something about the mechanics in this game makes it feel right.Do NOT let the cartoony style fool you - this is a must buy for your Vive - it is worth every penny!Edit: If I could ask for one single addition it would be to allow for manual reload of weapons using your offhand vive controller the same way it is done in H3VR. That would make it all but perfect."

The lighthearted zombie cutouts were amusing, the game looked and felt good, and the sounds of the guns were solid.However it's just not worth $20 by any stretch of the imagination ($10 would be more favorable, but still iffy).The game is so bare in it's content, that it's just not that fun after an hour or two.Yeah I can unlock more guns (Progression is actually a great tool that some of these content-lacking VR games should use), and there are leaderboards... But outside of those there's really nothing.The gameplay is very bland, the shooting mechanics while acceptable, seriously need some more active ""reload"" mechanism, and regardless of the change in levels they all feel identical.VR is pretty bare game-wise at the time of this review, but even still this sort of empty feeling game just feels overpriced."

It is pretty fun to fight your way out when you're surrounded by ten zombies right in your face.  You can also physically hit them with the gun.  Tossing a propane tank into the air and shooting it is pretty cool.   Good idea to make individual scoreboards based on weapon selection.It may be just another VR shooter, but did hold my interest longer than any of the other Vive arcade shooter games on my first play - I think that says a lot.  When I play a popular space shooter, I only get 15 minutes out of it till I get bored.  The game has several different levels and game modes which keep it from feeling stale too quickly.I think the sale price that I paid is worth it.  I hope a few more weapons or levels are added later."

,Recommended,446620,22659915,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,jaeger,"Zombie Training Simulator is an addicting wave-based survival shooter. Gunplay is solid with no complaints. I am a huge fan of the cartoon pseudo 2d theme. It creates an atmosphere the is enganging, but, not tense and draining such as a more horror themed survival shooter such as The Brookhaven Experiment. The cartoony theme and low level violence makes this game suitable for older children. The difficulty settings provide a suitable challenge for any skill ranges. In addition to wave-based survival there is also skill based challenges which test the player's ability to cope with a specific circumstance. The progression system and gunplay make this title enjoyable and something you will keep coming back to for quite a while.Gameplay Breakdown:Choose from one of the guns on the table and select your challenge. In Survival, you use the resources on your table and explosives littered around the map to make it to the end of the wave. Meat acts as a zombie magnet. Propane tanks and gas cans are throwable explosives that need to be shot. Grenades are throw-and-forget timed explosives. The objective in the skill challenges varies from one to the next.Pros:+Cartoony theme is enjoyable and suitable for older children.+Intense zombie gameplay without a tense atmosphere.+Multiple maps and skill challenges.+Progression system to unlock bigger and badder guns.+Throwable resources and littered explosives respawn at the end of the round.+Difficulty settings make this title accessible for any player regardless of skill level.+Theming is great for people who want to shoot massive amounts of zombies but not have to deal with a scary or dramatically tense atmoshpere.Cons:-The weapon system is a bit disappointing in that you can't have both the traditional primary (assault rifle, smg, shotgun) and secondary (pistol) at one time. Because of this there is almost never a reason to use the pistols once you unlock better weapons because they are straight inferior. Being able to swap to your secondary instead of reloading would fix this, and, greatly improve gameplay.-The strategy for survival seems pretty systematic. Throw meat to distract the zombies. Throw explosives into large groups if there isn't one littered nearby. Shoot at zombie heads. Throw more meat when the previous one's duration expires.-After completion of a skill challenge there is no incentive to replay beyond trying to beat your time.-Progression system seems to be a bit of a grind.-Unlocking new guns is only achievable through total zombie kills. Pretty boring, as they could have instead rewarded by beating a certain amount of waves on a map or a certain time/score in a skill challenge.-I don't know how much additional content is going to be added post-launch.All in all I feel that this title was still worth the $20."

The guns feel natural to use and killing wooden zombie cutouts is so satisfying when they explode into little bits after a headshot.

The developers are very active, responding to the discussion board when people have problems. It’s a great game to play, and a go-to when showing off the Vive as it’s easy to pick up and doesn’t scare people (you don’t have to worry about people slamming the ceiling with your controller). It also doesn’t take a lot of space for room scale, so if you’re like me and have a small play area, this game is perfect. I feel it’s well worth the $20 asking price, especially when comparing to other VR games right now asking more for less."

Well, it still is a ""shoot zombies"" game, but this is really fun. The feeling is similar to Point Blank with a lightgun (if anyone remembers that from Playstation days). All zombies are made of cardboard, you can shoot them to bits but only headshots kill them.To make things interesting you have some objects to throw and shoot, like meat to gather them at one place and then throw a grenade. Or throw a gas canister and shoot it mid-air above their heads.The only kind of progression is unlocking weapons, going from pistols through shotgun to fully automatic rifles (and btw, it's totally weird to hold a rifle with one hand in VR), but it will keep you entertained for quite a while."

I am especially fond of the skill challenges, but found fun in every mode. Survival is especially hectic, and is the closest I've come to damaging one of my controllers.

,Recommended,446620,22507676,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,Sven Viking,"I bought this thinking I might refund it if it didn't seem worth the money, but it turned out to be surprisingly fun. Also helped me improve my aim in other games with less-frequent shooting.The survival modes tend to involve mowing down literally hundreds of zombies in a wave, which can get to feel like overkill at times, requiring constantly mashing the trigger, but there's some strategy involved in using explosives etc. I spent the most time trying to improve my scores in the various skill modes. Guns reload automatically rather than requiring any complex motions, but that's necessary due to the constant streams of zombies.One major drawback: No dual wielding of any weapons. The only thing your second hand is useful for is throwing grenades and other objects, and most of the time you'd be better using both hands on one controller. They should really allow at least akimbo pistols, even if it was a bonus mode without a scoreboard. Hopefully they'll consider it in an update."

There are great choices for both survival modes and skill based modes, and a sizeable choice of weapons. You actually unlock these weapons by doing something great: killing zombies. The guns feel accurate in how they operate, and look great.The graphical and design choices for this game work very well. At first I wondered about how I felt when looking at the screenshots, but the cartoonish appearance makes the game very fun and lighthearted, yet I still find myself in a brief panic when a large horde of zed run at me and I haven't any grenades. The less-realistic graphics also make the game kid-friendly and good for those who aren't a huge fan or horror games or similar.There are a few music tracks that can be played on the in game radio, and they add a nice effect to the game. The sounds are really great, and while the zombies may look friendly, they make all sorts of traditional zombie games.I would suggest this game for anyone looking for a Vive shooter, I personally have found myself playing it more than other games I own."

The table was right next to me and I was able to reach everything with no issues.  A wheelchair-bound buddy of mine was also able to play this game just fine, as he could still see over the table while seated.TL:DR - This game is also playable if you have a 'standing only' Vive setup."

The developers nailed the Vive controller to pistol handling simulation.  The developers did the in game feeling of holding a real weapon when you are really holding a Vive controller.  My favorite in game weapon is the Glock as it is the lightest weapon in the game's arsenal and closest to the controller size and weight.  The grip angle is right and the you can sight down the weapon as in real life and you can even do position Sul or other ready positions.  There are no reload mechanics as reloading is automatic.The game also has a high replay value as the game consist of quick challenges that last from  a little over a second each to  survival modes that may last 5 to 10 minutes each."

,Recommended,446620,22515823,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,ben the biscuit,"EDIT: After playing for a while the honeymoon phase of this game starts to end fairly quickly. It's a very repetitive game however the devs have been adding more and more cool content so it is definitely a worthwhile purchase now. Previously I was on the fence but now that they have added dual wielding I think there is enough content for the price. It is also fantastic for showing people new to VR as it runs well, the guns are satisfying and the aesthetic is cool.______________Previous review:__________________Don't be fooled by the cartoony style - this game is intense.I would definitely recommend getting this game, it's a charming wave shooter that isn't just barebones.The main meat of the game is in the survival modes, and facing giant hordes while managing distractions and explosives is really cool. You can get hundreds to thousands of kills in a good survival session and it really gives the feel of mowing down a horde. What makes this game different to a barebones wave shooter like space pirate trainer is the progression system, the gamemodes, and the different maps.Unlocking new guns sets a good goal and pushes you to play just a little bit more to try out the next gun, and I'm always  looking forward to the next unlock. Night time mode is also great, and it kind of gives the same feeling I get in the Brookhaven experiment demo - although this has a lot more to do right now and runs a lot better.Shooting feels really good in this game, and my bullets are always going where I feel like they should go. Some other games don't have the gunplay feeling as right, but it feels really good here and you can really hone your accuracy.The zombies looking like cutouts is a really good thing for the game - landing shots has a lot of visual feedback, and the simple look of the zombies means you can have hordes of hundreds on screen at once.In terms of performance, it is really good as a result of the cartoon style, which also looks great. The game runs really well. I am getting 90fps and running the game butter smooth even on my old 7950, which is below the minimum spec. Giant hordes and explosions don't seem to make a difference.While the game is already great, it would be awesome if the devs added more maps, and more guns. I would love some akimbo/duel wield gun unlocks too as most of the game you are just doing nothing with your non-shooting hand save for the occasional grenade/meat throw. However, the game is still awesome and very easy to get into for showing your friends, and I'd say quite worth the price for the amount of time you can get out of it."

Your standard mode is a wave survival style game, you pick a weapon at the start of a game and stick with it for as long as possible. You are always postitioned next to a table containing various supplies to help you fight off the undead hoards including steaks which can be thrown to distract the zombies who will gather around the hunk of meat until it is completely consumed, these are essential to survival as the sheer number of zombies on-screen would overwhelm you if not for this element of control. You also have grenades which explode after a set time when you throw them and shootable explosives like propane bottles and jerry cans which can make you feel like a complete badass if you shoot them in the air.The graphics are simple but effective, the idea of the game is to simulate training yourself for the zombie apocalypse, so you aren't fighting real zombies, but instead some very stylised cardboard cutout zombies, these can only be killed with a headshot meaning that this game is more about precision and strategy than wildly firing at the hoards. The survival mode has multiple maps of various difficulties, zombies will have different paths and items on your table will vary from level to level.The challenges are all about defeating a set number of zombies in the fastest time possible, Crow's foot is all about precision, eliminating four zombies from both sides in the fastest time possible, where as Zombie bowling has a huge hoard lined up like bowling pins, armed with one grenade and your gun of choice, you have to clear the whole lot in the quickest time you can.If you feel yourself getting too well aquanted with the game and want to ramp things up a little, you can switch to night time mode, you gun will have a flashlight on it and this will be the only way you will be able to see, it really changes the gameplay and puts you even more on your toes as it's not as easy to know where the zombies will be coming from.With a variety of weapons which can be gradually unlocked by killing a specified number of zombies which can be used across each gameplay type, each with their own leaderboards, there is a lot here to keep you coming back. You get a lot of value from the game and it's easily one of my favourite Vive experiences so far."
