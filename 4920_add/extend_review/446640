Kudos to Pilgrim Adventures for this simple, yet charming game(s), with a straight-forward narrative and interesting world-building. I'll be looking forward for more games from these developers and writers.Nonetheless I think this saga could had been extended into more episodes; I think the aforementioned world-building was cut short due to the 4 episodes limit. I feel like there was room for a wider narrative without necessarely making the story bloated. Still, it is better to conclude a story too soon than to conclude it too late."

The two first parts are a little lighter both in tone and difficulty while the last two parts really adds a lot of story and puzzles that usually don't leave you hanging for too long. The journal is usually help enough.Technically this installment is the best in the series with some animation, extra graphics and music. The third game had this as well but this one adds a little more.So do I like the game and series? Yes and I would recommend it to anyone who likes story, puzzles and laid back games. It's an example of how good a game can be from available game making tools."

Gail Pilgrim travels to other places and usually in trouble. Through the episodes, you can play as a different character for their part of the story.  Even though the game is made in RPG maker, there is no leveling in it. You’ll talk to people, combine items, use it, and examine things. It’s a point-and click adventure filled with a good story, puzzles, and clichés. As you progress to each episode, you find more content leading to a longer gameplay. I felt that the ending of Space Pilgrim Adventures left a possibility to expand the series. The game is still good overall!"

The puzzles are decent and generally not too challenging, but they all make sense in their context. The final closure wass good and satisfying, both for Pilgrim as a character and the whole universe the game is set in.The game is still linear though, and the flaunted ""decisions"" aren't really there or make much difference: at least this time we get a bit of character depth though.There's alot to like both in Episode IV and the saga as a whole if you're ok with its simplicity both in story and gameplay: for its price it's a good amount of fun."

Only play this after you've played Space Pilgrim Episodes I, II & III, as the story continues from there. As like before, the game is in adventure point-n-click format and you can play using either keyboard, mouse, or a combination of both.VerdictLike its predecessors, but better. Has more content, and actual real choice. There's more than 1 ending, and the story branches differently depending on what decisions you make. Continuation from previous episodes is completely seamless, and leads to a very satisfying conclusion. Attention to detail (i.e. the number of items in the scene that can be clicked on to yield descriptions), as with prior episodes, is always a plus.TL;DRI highly recommend the entire Space Pilgrim series to all old-school adventure gamers who appreciate a well-crafted, well-paced story with just enough drama and intrigue to keep you interested, and is high on the exploration factor."

The story is nice but it's really the character that makes mark this serie of little game, they're all very clearly defined and written consistently.A big BIG plus for givng us a choice about gail future and with whom.To think this is the work of only one guy, pretty impressive and super cheap toogameplay wise nothing to hard, pretty casual for an adventure game didn't stay stuck for long at any point."

The store begins with Gail and her friends trapped in a Jackal prison, but obviously it isn't going to end that way, right? By the end of the game the rebels will finally take the fight to the Jackals in this thrilling conclussion to Gail's story. At $2 an episode this has been a surprisingly quality ride with a lovable cast and some cool adventures. The game clocks in at around 5 hours (At least for ""often gets stuck"" me).There was one puzzle in particular that had me stumped and I had to look it up. I doubt I would have solved it due to a mislead item description, but oh well.I honestly hope we have not seen the last of Gail Pilgrim.8/10"
,Recommended,446640,23446394,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,Eli the Grey,"Episode IV is a very fitting conclusion to the Space Pilgrim saga, and just as much fun as the previous entries.  This should only be played after episodes I-III have been completed, as you will need to be familiar with the story that has taken shape in order to enjoy its conclusion.  Make no mistake, these games are short and relatively simple, but they provided just the right level of engagement for multi-tasking while I played, and I had a blast with the series.  I would love to experience a continuation of Gail's story someday, but if this is the last time we see the crew of the Quicksilver, it is a very fitting end."

Quite the contrary.  This latest installment kicks off where the previous one ended (on a cliffhanger) and I've been playing the whole series for the past few days, each day coming back from work looking forward to playing. It has been a while since any game managed to do that. Too bad that this is already the last episode, the setup sure offers more posibilities for more storylines and episodes."

,Recommended,446640,29141918,Posted: 9 January,all,jannikins,"This marks the end of the Space Pilgrim saga. If you're planning to buy the game, I would recommend the whole series as they will make so much more sense playing all together.This final episode does offer more quests/tasks to do, and you'll be able to play longer than the other 3. Choices do matter in this episode, and you'll only be able to get certain acheivements if you make certain choices. For me I liked this series, it was a short but fun play. The ending is fulfilling as well to me. (Without giving away any spoilers!) :D"

Im planning to write a general review, and i will mention the related episodes if its necessary.Pros:+Great flick to spend some quality time+Cheap and gives you your moneys worth+Funny and interesting characters and dialogs+Way better than others games done with RPGMaker+The series get better with each episode+Subtle ongoing jokes+Point-and-click elementsCons:-It's a bit short (Only Episode I)-Ending feels a little cut short (Episode IV)-If you are a hardcore adventure gamer, you might not like it-Lacks music, beside the sound effects, (try Zelda Calm from youtube, really works well with the game)-You can feel the production is still amateur, you can tell its just done by RPGMaker-Couple of bugs (really minor stuff though)Overall, I can say that Space Pilgrim is a soft adventure game series, with minor problems, that starts good, and ends better. It's really a good way to spend some time. It REALLY requires music though... I can safely recommend this game to everyone, and im hoping the see more projects from Pilgrim Adventures if they keep going like this!"
