The fact that this game is 10 USD normally is appalling.There's no coherent story at all. You're a detective or investigator, but you find no clues. There's nothing that actually advances the story. You teleport from place to place inconsistently without context, and it just leaves the player confused.The atmosphere is just not there. There's typical horror music, but it's played throughout the entire ""scary"" chapters that it's pretty much just white noise by the time you actually hit your first enemy.Enemies are another thing. They're not scary, at all. These enemies have about the same level of scariness as a band member from G.W.A.R. What makes matters worse is that there really is no reason to be scared of them since you have guns that can kill the enemies easily. And to make it even less scary, on the ship level, you can get ammo way too easily. If you're going to give weapons, make the enemies much harder to defeat.The last thing I'll talk about is the optimization of the game. It's awful. I have a decent computer, it's not great, but it's okay. Intel i5 quadcore, and an Nvidia GT 730. It plays most of the games I throw at it at 30 frames or above. Except this, even on the lowest settings, I was only getting about 10-15 fps.Final rating:11/10 would play again."

,Not Recommended,446780,26684560,"Posted: 18 November, 2016",all,Indurok,"I bought this game for $0.10, and from what I've seen, I regret paying even that much.Why did I let the trailer fool me? I was expecting this game to be like Sector or All Is Dust; bad but also silly, and easy to make fun of, which is what I enjoy about playing bad games. But there's none of that in this game. In fact, it's probably the worst of the worst games I've ever played.I spent the first 30 minutes of this game just walking and opening doors, and that's... it. There was nothing else, no enemies, no main objective besides ""walk"" and ""open door"", no point in exploring, and there is not even any plot actually shown in the game. I couldn't tell this was an investigation of missing people. At least not until I looked at the description of the game. Couldn't they also have shown at least some bit of story in the game too, instead of just in the description?And killing enemies with a weapon wasn't all that satisfying either. Getting the shotgun after the 30 minute mark was literally the most exciting moment in the entire game. But when you kill enemies in first-person shooters, it's supposed to be fun. This was not fun. You move backwards at a snail's pace, so you can't get away from an enemy and shoot it at the same time, not that it matters, since he only takes away 2% health with each hit. Plus, your health regenerates, so it's not that hard to beat some areas.I should also probably mention that the levels take FOREVER to get through. Seriously, they just drag on and on and on. The first few levels are nothing but several minutes of walking. And some of the levels are very maze-like, making it confusing and even more time-consuming just to figure out where I need to go. Even if enemies are thrown at you, you don't even have to fight them, since you're faster than them. You can just run right to the end. This isn't a horror game. It's a borer game. 'Cause I'm frigging bored.Also, I found myself stuck inside the walls. Word of advice: Don't do that. There are quite a few glitches in this game. I was in a room with catwalks, and when I actually walked onto certain parts of the catwalks, things would disappear from the room. It was weird, but then again, so is the whole game.So if you're like me, and enjoy poking fun at bad games, this is the wrong game to go with. Don't waste your time with this one."

Monotonous glitch galore huge levels and before you think it no that isn't a good thing in this game,thesecond stage is huge and overall pointless. There is no direction or story in this game which ok benefit of the doubt but it just makes the hugeness of the maps even more pointless since there is no secret note for extra plot like in outlast. Or even really important supplies since you can just run past the enemies. The game isn't scary no atmosphere at all and lag spikes all over the place the game doesn't even restart the game itself is trying to stop you from playing. There are basically 2 types of levels in this game maze levels and supremely long monotonous levels where you are endlessly walking to the next insignificant area. The maze levels are even worse endless running through different areas with one trillion pointless rooms for one room with the right portal aka level 4. All of these things you can find in level four it is dreadful you guys it really is. Just reach that level and you will see what I mean sorry this was so long and overstayed its welcome...ahem"

,Not Recommended,446780,28322190,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,Sharp Income,"Advertised as a first-person horror game...(I was under the impression it was a first-personshooterhorror game-more emphasis on shooting than there actually is) In my 0.7 hours, my experience was mostly, walking/running around aimlessly trying to find where to go. So then I thought, this must just be a puzzle/maze game, and I just need to find the next teleporter to get to the next section of the game-not what I had in mind before booting up the game (or purchasing). So then eventually I get teleported into a cargo ship, and it's super dark inside. Yeah, not fun wandering around in the dark trying to find where to go when you can barely see doors on the wall when you pass them in the limited light. At this point you get a shotgun and have to fight a few... humanoid creatures. But the majority of the time is spent figuring out where to go; enemies just become a nuisance, not a fun challenge, as they just slow you down from 'exploring'/finding the way out of another maze-only to end up in yet another maze/huge open level where your only objective is to get to point B. The environments are, well, IMO, passable for an indie game. Not very detailed or well populated environments, and each is painfully lack variety within its own section of the game (bunker rooms are identical except for blood splatters and the hallways large rooms lack variety; cargo ship hallways/rooms look identical) The combat is somewhat clumsy, so even if there was more focus on that, it still would be marred. No combat focus/challenge, no story presented in the game, no horror (or not yet), no point. I haven't played all the way through, though, so it's possible there is more to it. But in the almost 1 hour I played it, it doesn't give me the impression of being a competent or passable game experience compared to what it's aiming to be.Also, it uses the unity launcher, but it doesn't accept rebinding the controls there, they are hardcoded:WASD - movemouse - aim/look (super high sensitivity, btw. I wonder if the dev's using 500 dpi or lower on his machine? I set my mouse to 500dpi (the lowest it'll go!) and it's still a little fast for my liking)R - reloadF - useQ/E - prev/next weaponH - holster (don't know when you'd need this?)Space - jumpShift - run/sprintC (hold) - crouch (if you use C for crouch, this ought to be a toggle. As a hold, it prevents you from strafing right while crouched. Better yet, allow user to rebind controls and use both a hold to crouch and toggle crouch key)Left click - fireright click (hold) - aim/use sightsIf you just want to experience this game to explore the different environments (solve the mazes) you see in the screenshots, and don't mind the repetativeness of them (or maybe can come at that as a challenge), then sure, I could recommend this game for the 9¢ I paid for it. I don't recommend it based on how it measured up to what it was trying to sell itself as, even taking into account that it's an indie game.Suggestions for the dev:This could've been better (IMO) had it focused more on combat. There are HUGE environments with nothing to do but wander around and try to find your way out-which turns the game into more of a chore than a fun, entertaining form of interaction. Populate the areas with enemies and weapons and ammo and maybe use a waypoint here and there, or an option for a ""hint"" to show you where to go. Otherwise, like I said, the game just turns into a navigation chore, and isn't much of a game at all. Add more variety in the levels: have some items/objects out of place, more and more varied objects in each environment (for example, how about some small bushes in the outdoor levels, not just trees all the same height). Custom keybinds are always nice."
