As a long time Zelda fan I must say I am convinced by the game. The gameplay is so far (first main dungeon) a lot more challenging than I expected it to be and sometimes pretty fast paced. The humour and story telling is great. Can't say much about the whole plot (and wouldn't want to spoil anyone's fun anyway), but I really like the way it is presented to the player.Biggest perk: You get to play a little girl slaying bad guys, rob peoples' homes and smash their furniture.Would buy again, 7/5 ;)"

There's cool music and the skillfull humor included in the game world (writing and design/etc).There's a variety of weapons/tools for the player to use - and the game keeps unlocking/giving me more as it progresses. So there's a sense of choice/tactics of how to defeat enemies.For the most part the game is a fairly relaxing romp through various challenges/puzzles/encounters/bosses. The game balance ""feels"" just right to me - there's certain rooms that are pretty easy and some that are very frantic dodging around. There's a variety of puzzles that range from fairly simple and more than one that I had to scratch my head a bit on (a few that took more than some head scratching - that are optional - with tons of gold as a reward).Overall its a relaxing game play experience - and I'm greatly enjoying making my way through the game.Wouldn't mind a ""Blossom Tales 2 - Revenge of the Pots!"" :)"

It feels alot like the old SNES Link to the Past Zelda game which I wish there were more games like this.I'm using an xbox one wireless PC controller and it's working great, didn't have to mess with any controls yet.  Everything is working great.Definitely would continuously support developers that make more games like this!  If you're an old NES/SNES gamer and like the old Zelda/Link games then this is a must have."
,Recommended,446810,31549346,Posted: 4 May,all,ArtificialRaven,"Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King is a top down adventure game in the fashion of ye olde Zelda classics such as A Link to the Past. Though that much should be obvious from the screenshots and trailer but maybe you never played the old Zelda games, I dunno.  Game is best played with a gamepad and doesn't control well with K&M, though it's not impossible if you have to play it like that. Graphically it has a colorful 16-bit theme and support for high resolutions, I was playing in 1080p so I can say that one works for sure. Musically it's okay. It has a few catchy tunes that fit the theme and tone. And the sound effects perfectly replicate that 16-bit feel.You play as Lily, a young girl who starts off her morning by heading to the castle to visit King Orchid so she can become a Knight of the Rose. Unfortunately she gets caught up in a heinous plot by the King's wicked brother, Crocus the Wizard. Crocus curses the King with an eternal sleeping spell and it's Lily's obligation to go and retrieve the 3 magical ingredients to cure him of this curse before Crocus can muster an army of evil big enough to sieze the entire Kingdom.Much like A Link to the Past, Lily can swing a sword, use bombs and a bow, learns magic and much more. Pressing start will bring up your inventory screen that shows everything Lily owns, including how many pieces of heart she has, skills and weapons & spells, even ingredients needed for quests. The sword will always be bound to one button/key but there are 2 other slots to switch in whatever the situation calls for. Speaking of quests, yeah, there are sidequests. Usually collect 20 of an item and then turning them over to an NPC for a reward but it's a reward that's worthwhile and fulfilling. There's also a world map that shows your location and where you needs to go. I'd say the world is a decent size, 5 dungeons if we include the castle tutorial dungeon. There are plenty of hidden everythings to find all over the map using bombs and other tools. The dungeons include a lot of block and switch puzzles and other puzzles that require specific tools so expect those to get harder the farther you progress. There are even mini-games that will test your archery skills and others that test speed. There is some verticality to the terrain, Lily can jump from ledges to get to otherwise innaccesible areas or shortcuts. There's really not much that's fundamentally different from the already established genre, it just improves upon the old with quality of life changes.My 2 main complaints about it are Lily's movement speed which is quite slow. And the 2nd one is that instead of having a numerical value to how many bombs or arrows she has it instead uses a power bar. Or stamina bar if you prefer to call it that. Which I consider a drawback considering how often you'd like to use your nice tools & spells. But I guess it works for this game, it didn't break the game for me but I was just mildly annoyed having to wait for it to charge.All in all I enjoyed this game very much and I feel it does the same for classic Zelda-like adventure games what Shovel Knight did for classic platforming games. I'm not saying it's better than Zelda, not at all. But I thought it came pretty close. Would I recommend this? Hell yeah, even at full price."

FOR PC! anyone who doesn't own a nintendo console that can play Zelda, this really is a must have for you, The story is great, and I really love choosing between the kids ideas! (Golems FTW) The dungeons are not forgettable and I love the ""Side quests"" It truly is amazing and I give massive credit to whoever made this game (I don't feel like looking) Thank You! P.S Music is Great, and It's super frustrating in a good way."
,Recommended,446810,30991381,Posted: 6 April,all,Raiden,"Blossom Talesnails it in the aesthetics department, and presents us a fun little world to roam around in and explore. It is justfunto cut the grass and ruin everyone's homes!Let's start with the biggest positive: The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in any game, huge praise be to Visager. I've already beaten the game but I'm gonna be blasting this OST for sure! He also did fine work on the sound effects, even if a few didn't fit quite right (in my opinion, the sword beam noise sounded like a pleasant aura, when it should sound like an offensive attack).Much like Castle Pixel's first titleRex Rocket, the ""retro"" look is solid, the writing is fun, light and humorous, very reminiscent of old RPG Maker games I'm sure we all used to dabble in, and little details are everywhere. Tons of neat little graphical effects, objects to interact with, etc. keeps it somewhat fresh and interesting. Lot of cool, fun secrets to discover in each map!The teleport checkpoint system keeps things smooth, light, fun, quick, and casual. I would describe the game as these 5 words most of all in fact. The story presentation with the grandfather telling the story by the fireplace adds to this flavor as well, and it's just addicting to run around slashing your sword.However, I feel as thoughmuchmore moderation was needed from a gameplay design standpoint. At some point it felt like I was playing the same puzzles again and again and I lost interest and became frustrated. Way too many walking block puzzles, pushing block puzzles, and Simon Says, to name the top 3. I would've liked to see more variety of stage elements and more interesting clever puzzles that take advantage of all the neat weapons you have at your behest. It got a bit tedious in some spots, for example there was one part with an extremely overlong breaking/falling rock path: if you happened to get hit anywhere along it, you get sent all the way back. This is what I mean by moderation: that concept and idea could have been conveyed without it being THAT long, maybe half the length or even less. ""Progression"" shouldn't just mean repeating the same idea but making it twice as long. Some fat trimming would have done this game a lot of good.A similar complaint was the lack of interesting quests, almost every quest was basically a fetch quest. Fetch me 20 of this, fetch me 20 of that. Once again, too much of the same thing. These quests, and the corresponding item drops from enemies, remind me of a dry MMORPG, which I'm not a big fan of personally and doesn't fit in this style of game. That said, some of the minigames were cool, like the races and archery range. Would have liked to see more of these.Also the boss fights were a tad uninteresting, no real mechanic or trick you had to figure out to beat them. Just slash or bomb away. Pretty sure all bosses were simply weak to every weapon in the game? If not, I couldn't tell the difference. I suppose this was to keep things simple, but perhaps it's a bit too simple.These grievances aside,Blossom Talesis still a solid 15 hours of action adventure, if you're going for that fun, light touch. Buy it for your kids and yourself both!"
,Recommended,446810,30822576,Posted: 29 March,all,Archonate,"The one to one mapping of controls to SNES era Zelda is near perfect, fun dungeons and easy to drop into. Better Zelda-like than a lot of the more ambitious attempts, gets core zelda mechanics down solid."
,Recommended,446810,30808082,Posted: 28 March,all,anonagon,"not super far into this (just finished the first main dungeon) but I can tell you already that this is a good game. Nothing here has struck me as incredible or must-experience, but its a very solid, well made, enjoyable game. If you like 2D Zelda games, you will probably like this, though you won't find anything revolutionary here.I'll update this review if I have any more important thoughts after playing more."
76561198023210932,Recommended,446810,30912644,Posted: 2 April,all,-=Grimmix=-,I am loving this game so much! Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is one of my all-time favorite games. This game really comes close to the same greatness!
76561197990859503,Recommended,446810,32581285,Posted: 19 June,all,SargeSmash,"This shouldn't surprise anyone that has looked at the game, but theZelda-inspiration on tap here, especially fromLink's Awakening, should be quite apparent.  And much like that game, it's a very, very good time.  The game is packed with lots of little secrets, and a charming art style.  Four dungeons seems a bit short, but they are quite lengthy, and you will find other smaller areas to poke around for secrets, so length isn't really an issue.Dungeons themselves aren't quite as non-linear as I'd like.  There are plenty of puzzles to go around, though, even if some are of the block-pushing, ""snake""-style walking over tiles (don't step on a tile you've already stepped on), or other such challenges.  A bit more emphasis has been placed on some death-trap sequences, often over a collapsing floor.  These can be a little frustrating if you don't have some action-gaming chops.  There is also quite a bit of combat throughout the game, and it's worth taking advantage of some of your tools (governed by a magic meter) or some of the sword abilities, including the requisite spin-slash or the newly-added ground-slam attack.Don't let the specter of difficulty dissuade you, though.  The game really isn't very challenging, as life-restoring items are quite abundant for those that explore thoroughly, not to mention lengthening your life meter just like aZeldagame.One of the more interesting changes fromLink's Awakeningis being able to move and swing your sword at the same time.  This makes things feel quite a bit different at times, sometimes for the better and sometimes not.  I wish that the range was just a little longer on your swipes.Really, this game hit 8/10 territory for me, it's an extremely solidZeldaclone that also manages to carve out its own identity in the process.  If you've got a hankering for old-schoolZelda, and the new-fangledBreath of the Wildisn't doing it for you, check outBlossom Tales!"

From the begining this game oozes old school Link to the past nostalgia.The soundtrack is great, the gameplay is great, and the puzzles are just hard enough to make you think for a bit.My only real complaints is that the game isnt longer and not very difficult, but hey it was only $15 and well worth the money.9/10"
,Recommended,446810,30878325,Posted: 1 April,all,NeO,"Beautifully made retro-Zelda-like game, with a female lead, and some family-friendly humour.I came across this on /r/NintendoSwitch and have bought it to show my support for the developers bringing the game to the Switch.I'd also like to give respect to the developer for releasing a nice little demo to play before buying, it help solidify my decision to support it.Great to also see seamless controller support as I grabbed my DS4 already paired from some earlier gaming (DS4Tool) to find it just works instantly and the icons show the relevent Xbox pad buttons instead ofthe Keyboard keys.So in case it's not clear, PLEASE PORT THIS TO NINTENDO SWITCH, it's the perfect form factor for pick up and play of this great little game!"

,Recommended,446810,31122484,Posted: 13 April,all,SAJewers,"Man, this is great.It's heavily inspired by the Classic 2D Legend of Zelda Games, but with an interesting twist in the narration, that gives it a nice charm. There were a few puzzles that were way too hard to me, and some might find the game easier than classic Zelda games, but other than that, It's really well done.100% recommend. If you're even remotely interested in the genre, give it a shot."

When they fix the issue, I'll turn this into a positive review for sure. Please don't think this as some petty revenge of sorts; I just really cannot recommend a game that doesn't start (and I work in IT, so I've triedallthe usual troubleshooting)."
76561198026234938,Recommended,446810,30847196,Posted: 30 March,all,Bubbleknight,"Well, what can I say? Zelda fans will find a familiar gameplay here. The Story is about a king that got put to sleep (like Zelda in Link's past in SNES) and the character, a little girl has to find 3 ingredients to make the magical potion to wake the king up.Besides your main quest, like Zelda, you'll also find a lot of side quest to give you power ups. Like the heart container, magic meter, extra equipment like the shovel, and etc. Boss fights are interesting but nothing you can't beat after memorizing the pattern. Staple weapons like the boomerang and arrows also are in this game. The similarity to Zelda is overwhelming in this game!Pros:- Plays like Zelda (maybe)- Open world- Fluent controls- Fun to play- Kids friendly- Easy to pick up- Side questsCons:- Copied Zelda too much?- Story could be a little longerI mean, you just have to see it to feel it. The first 20min(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjCdFtVlQH0&t=961s)you fight in the castle clearing out the rat dungeon lol. After that it's pretty straight forward, just follow the marker on the map to your main quest!-BK"
,Not Recommended,446810,31709389,Posted: 12 May,all,Allthegoodnamestaken,"I like this game when it starts. It doesn't do anything revolutionary, but it's a solid Link's Awakening-like for the price.The problem is that this game doesn't start 80% of the time. A number of users have reported a Visual C++ runtime error that causes the game to crash on startup, but the devs have done no more than acknowledge the problem after six weeks. My thread showing the issue is not related to BitDefender didn't even get a response. The game will sometimes start successfully and allow you to play, but my experience is that if it fails once, you're not going to be playing at all that day.Note that the demo does NOT necessarily reflect whether or not you'll have this issue - that ran just fine for me, but when I finally got around to playing Blossom Tales after the refund period had ended, the runtime error suddenly started happening.It's a good game when it starts, but I can't possibly recommend something this unstable, especially when the devs aren't communicating anything about what they're doing to fix it. If you absolutely must buy this game, make sure you test it thoroughly before losing your refund eligibility."

Still haven't finished it, is a shame.I like the allusion to Zelda: Link To The Past and the Oracle games. The inspiration is obvious, but it doesn't feel like a soulless ripoff. The time I played through the game I saw the heart and soul that was put into this affectionate homage of a classic game. Aside from that, it plays smoothly and though it is a bit heavy on my laptop at times (likely due to the lighting and post-processing) I didn't have any significant lag either, just some framedrops here and there.All in all, I recommend this game."
