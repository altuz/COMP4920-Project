But it is a lovely story none the less. Great for the very young children with shorter concentration span's I think :)I feel the price is a little to much, for such a very short story, the Art is lovely though. So if your interested in this story for your younger children or maybe Grandchildren, perhaps wait for a decent discount, unless these developers lengthen the story more."

The story however seems to lack depth.Know what your buying, It is slightly overpriced for something so short.I have mixed feelings about recommending this. Its not amazing nor is it bad. Its a story book that you can buy on steam."

We all have that inner fear that sometimes can consume us. That is what this story was to me, about accepting that fear, understanding it but most of all accepting that it is there, it exists and that although it may not feel like it, it has the purpose of making us stronger to tackle the challenges life brings us.Och ja, mamma kan blive radd också<3"

76561198104311767,Recommended,446830,22034891,"Posted: 24 March, 2016",all,Lord Fang,"I know the Lonesome Fog is more about fears and doubts in general, but it really speaks to my depression.Especially one of the last lines where it speaks about her (the cub who I believe is Inna) facing the “Lonesome Fog” head on each time it came to pass before returning to her family.I think it speaks not to let your depression, or simple fears and doubts in general consume you but at the same time, not to just run away each time they act up.Face your insecurities and learn to resolve them, grow braver with each time they whisper doubts in your ears.You will be fine. The fog will come to pass, even if it takes hours, days- perhaps even years -everything will pass on.That’s the Circle."

,Recommended,446830,30438417,Posted: 10 March,all,ikittkatt,"At first I was to scared to read this because I thought the lonesome fog would get me in my sleep if I have a nightmare. But mama lynx read it to me and now I feel like I can take on the world! Very cute story this is. I hope more mama lynx read this to their children so when they grow it the story passes on to teach baby lynx to face their fears. I've grown up now so I read to my cousins baby lynx and she loves it. Very cute and the story feels so real with the sounds!  It feels like I'm there, or maybe I am.. Meow :3"

Read this story to my 4 year old son and he loved it, being able to relate himself to the cub for his fear of the dark. My only complaint is the lack of a narrator. At least for a short story that is around $5, it should have had a narrator. But it was a cute story that my son loved so I'll give it a thumbs up."

I would certainly love to read more stories like this, and maybe with more interactive effects.Overall, really well written and drawn story."

,Recommended,446830,22035346,"Posted: 24 March, 2016",all,Snowtoes,"I got the Pitter Patter Edition of Paws, and didn't quite know what I expected from this. All I know is that this turned out alotbetter and different than I first imagined.The Lonesome Fog shows how a cub has a lot of fears--ones that she can't seem get over--and shows how when met with the right conditions, everyone can get over their fears. The cub grew to be fearless, just like how everyone can be if they wanted to...atleast, that's the vibe I got from it.Anywho, while it was a tiny bit short, it was truly a masterpeice. The visuals are stunning, and the story is fantastic, besides a few grammar mistakes here and there.If the Shelter games are something you really enjoyed, I recommend that you read The Lonesome Fog. It's an amazing add-on to the story, and shows off some about how the Blob works. It's a truly stunning experiance."

In my opinion it's not only for children, but also for young adults (like me) or adults. With ""Might and Delight's"" unique art style and the wonderful music in the background it's a short, but amazing experience I don't want to miss."

A very adorable and beautiful story that tugged at my own experiences with anxiety and filled me with emotions, but idk if I feel good about paying 5 dollars for  3 minutes of trying to get a cursor to select the right button."

Definitely something to watch with your kids (they also seem to love the slight animations and the posibility to drag the pictures around a bit).And unlike the Shelter games, there aren't any invisible ninjas cutting onions in the room..."
