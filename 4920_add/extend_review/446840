76561198185116051,Recommended,446840,29767776,Posted: 7 February,all,Downward Thrust,"I'm happy with Splasher, surprisingly so.  After playing a few versions of the demo, and now having a full run under my belt of the full release, I can comment on a few things:Pros:-Excellent art and sound design-Fluid controls, nice and meaty (and appropriately floaty) - they don't take too long to get adjusted to-Difficulty curve seems to be on point, however a bit on the easy side for the first 10 levels-Fun sense of humor - love the art design and the comic relief of some of the collectibles-Gameplay mechanics are very polished, and feel very similiar to Super Meat Boy.  You feel in control - very important.Cons:-Often TOO forgiving - checkpoints are very generous, making it a little too easy to complete the game by default-Would love to see some multiplayer action for CO-OP, and have them develop a CO-OP based paint system-Would like to see more than 22 levelsHere's a video review for my full review of it:Video Review (more indepth)"
,Recommended,446840,31681158,Posted: 11 May,all,Frog Boi,"I've only cleared the first 10 levels but make no mistake: It only took one level to realise this game was really well made.If you're a fan of Super Meat Boy, N++, Dustforce and hell, even Super Mario World in some aspects you'll really love this (Especially if you're into speed running, going FAST and Kaizo stuff).The uniquity of Splasher though?There's 3 types of liquids primarily (I've seen thus far) which are Sticky, Bouncy and Water.Red gel makes you stick to surfaces, yellow gel makes you bounce and water cleans it all off. For that optimal time in a time attack mode, you need to know what gel needs to go where. Red gel on the floor slows you down but on walls and celings lets you move at full speed, so always make sure you spray down with water when there's some floor sections to have to traverse.Later on the game straight up gives you the bouncy and sticky gels to spray the floors yourself which ramps the difficulty up as you start relying less on reading the stage ahead of you and more on reactions, memorising stages and doing it fast, clean and stylishly.There's also 7 people to rescue in each stage treated as 'collectible' you have to grab to unlock more stages.The ability to switch between just the standard gameplay of playing the levels, complete with multiple checkpoints and the time attack and Selfish Speedrunner modes gives EVERYONE a good experience. Not very good at doing things personally? Can't memorise stages well? No worries just play the regular levels - it's still worth teh price tag. But for those who want that extra challenge, you've got the modes to test you.The soundtrack is great too, nothing MIND BLOWING but definitely found myself appreciating it and every jamming along at times (Notably: The first 'auto-scroller' stage, with green goop rising). Especially when you keep dying and starting from a checkpoint and the music kicks in like as if to say ""BACK TO IT SCRUB"".Visually, it's got cutesy, cartoon character and visuals a la Castle Crashers or any flash style/Behemoth game though I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad or negative thing. The style works well with the whole aethsetic and the goopy bright gels compliment this.I'm really looking forward to playing the rest of this wonderfully sculpted game and overall, this is the kind of game that has a LOT of life in it. To grabbing all the dudes in the stage, to getting the gold in time attack to completing the extra speed runnign mdoea and then even trying to get that top time on the leaderboards.Splasher is the first platformer in a long while I've truly just been impressed and entertained without any discrepencies. If I ♥♥♥♥ed up - it was on me. The game is solid and the Splashteam guys should be proud of what they've made.Also Shout out to GrandPOOBear for introducing me to this game."

As you progress through the game you unlock different liquids to shoot with your weapon. One allows you to climb walls, one allows you to jump from it to greater heights. It's a nice little gimmick that differentiates this title from others like it.Really tight controls, pleasant visuals, nice soundtrack. Levels were nice and varied, they presented a little bit of a challenge too. Replay value is pretty good with the speedrunning modes.I recommend this title!"

Should enter directly into anyone's top 10 or even top 5 platformer.

,Recommended,446840,30459482,Posted: 11 March,all,Toxiccoffee,"Splasher manages to mix in the goo elements from Portal 2 and the flow of Super Meat Boy into a fun platformer. The different inks are introduced steadily throughout the game and each level manages to introduce a new mechanic/concept to keep the game experience feeling fresh. While it's a relatively short game, having around 22 levels, there are still quite a few extras for the game such as a time trial mode and a speedrun mode to complete the whole game in a given time frame.One thing that I did find kind of annoying is getting the timing right on getting certain inks aimed at a particular direction. The way you aim your inks is through the same directional pad as your movement, which works well in game. However, there have been plenty of times where I've messed up a jump, because I didn't aim at the right spot and the right time. A suggestion I have would be to make the LT/L2 and RT/R2 buttons be made for aiming straight for a particular direction like up or down.That said, if you like precision based platformers, I'd gladly recommend Splasher. It's a fun game that makes good use of its ink mechanics and gives players a fun series of challenges throughout its level design."
,Recommended,446840,30502714,Posted: 13 March,all,Roahn,"Watch the reviewhereTitle: SplasherPlatform: Windows, MacRating: Not RatedDeveloper: SplashteamPublisher: The Sidekicks, Plug In DigitalPrice: $15 USDRelease Date: 7th Feb 2017Splasher is a fun and creative platformer with a hilarious style and top-notch music. And even though the actual speedrun aspect of this game can be questioned as it locks its ‘time attack’ game mode behind items that only hardcore fans will be inclined to get, this game is still a gem in an oversaturated genre and is a must have to any platformer fans, definitely for its low price tag.You play as a ‘Splasher’: a character that can do what any other character in a platformer does: run and jump. But this character has something a little different; an ink gun that can shoot water to hit switches and kill enemies, red ink that sticks him to walls and ceilings and yellow ink that makes him bounce high and reach otherwise impossible heights.The core gameplay of Splasher has you traversing through the 22 levels of getting through dangerous environments, saving the innocent co workers at Inkorp and destroying robotic enemies. Through these levels you’ll come across creative ways that the game spices up usual platforming such as lasers that kill you, rotating death traps, being chased by acid and a handful of well designed robots that will try and kill you in stylish ways. And all these tropes never feel overused so that nothing ever feels repetitive and you only feel that you have really done and seen everything only at the end when all the different level designs come together in one amazing final level.Other things that change up the platforming is the light on your feet puzzles to save the Inkorp workers, portals that will send you into an arena fighting robots and the time attack game mode that gets you to reach the end of the level in the fastest time. But to get this time attack game mode you have to rescue all the workers and get all the special golden ink that you can extract from walls and ceilings with your water gun for each level respectively. But I feel like it’s unnecessarily locked behind these collectibles just to increase the lifespan of the game as any hardcore platformer player could get through these levels easy and having to get these workers and golden ink just feels more tedious than actually difficult.But the gameplay is still really fun and enjoyable. And when you do hit all the right buttons and fly through the level, it feels more fluid and amazing than any other platformer I’ve played in the recent years. This is mainly because of the always tight controls and solid level design.The artstyle of Splasher is a hit and miss at times. Sure, it’s a colourful game and it suits well to the tight on the edge-of-your-seat platforming but when you stop to look you’ll realise that there is barely any detail and feels overly minimalistic. Although this is a small concern as you’ll never stop moving in Splasher, and you won’t want to as the level design is so great.The music though, is incredible. The techno synth heavy music never gets old and always aided in the gameplay and helped me push forward through some tougher bits. The sound design is just as good with you being able to hear the differences in each surface your character walks on and the sound of liquids hitting objects or enemies dying. You can tell just how much detail has gone in the sound design in immersing you into the wild and fast-paced levels of Inkorp.The only story you get is less of a cutscene and more of a string of pictures telling you how the boss at Inkorp has kidnapped their workers and are doing crazy scientific experiments on them. You as a ‘Splasher’ has found out, and armed with the trusty gun you have stolen you aim to reach to the top of inkorp and defeat the boss. And this is less of a story and more of an introduction of what you’ll see at Inkorp because this game is very funny in its style and ambience and you’ll find out quickly that this game doesn’t take itself seriously in the way that you die and interact with the enemies.In conclusion, you can sum up Splasher with one word: fun. Even though its speed run mode is locked behind tedium, it still doesn’t take away from the core gameplay, spectacular level design, detailed music, sound and a light-hearted ambience.That’s why i’m giving Splasher, a 4/5."

,Recommended,446840,30350699,Posted: 5 March,all,Cream-of-Plenty,"In Splasher, you play as a nimble hazmat agent who rushes through levels packed full of enemies and environmental hazards, rescuing fellow team members on the race to defeat a cigar-chomping scientist and his army of mutant potatoes.  Aiding you are a handful of brightly-colored liquids:  Water to wash surfaces clean (and blast most enemies), sticky goo to help you climb surfaces like a spider, and bouncy goo to propel you through the air like a lunatic.  It's all very vibrant and charming.  In this sense, the comparisons to Super Meat Boy and Splatoon are unsurprising.Challenge-wise, however, Splasher never really approaches the balls-hard difficulty of Super Meat Boy.  There are certainly situations where the average player may die 5 or 6 times attempting to navigate an area, but it doesn't remotely approach Super Meat Boy on the whole.  That may disappoint players who have been sold on the idea that Splasher will scratch the same itch that Super Meat Boy does; there's simply no comparison when it comes to difficulty.Similarly, at 22 levels, Splasher's packaged with a much smaller selection of levels than Super Meat Boy's 300+.  That isn't to say that Splasher's an especially short game, or that it's lacking material--on the contrary, between the ""normal"" game and the various speedrun modes/medals to earn, there's a decent amount of replayability to the game.  But again, it may disappoint players who expect for Splasher to boast multiple worlds, hidden levels, and various other secrets.That being said, will you enjoy Splasher?   If you like games such as Dust Force and Super Meat Boy for their mix of platforming, speed, and relative challenge, you'll most likely enjoy Splasher.  If you like leaderboards and discovering ways to shave seconds off of your PR times, you'll probably like Splasher.  But if you're looking for a game that's so hard it'll give you a nose bleed, you'll probably feel let down.PROS:+ A clean aesthetic that is generally very readable, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.+ Overall, the ""feel"" of the controls and the way the player handles is well done.+ Between the normal game, individual medal runs, and 3 different flavors of speedrun, there's plenty of replayability.CONS:- On a gamepad, the controls for movement and aiming are tied to the same analog stick, which can result in a lot of sloppy aiming and/or accidental movement; while this stems from compromises in the control scheme, it's still an incredibly frustrating problem that you will likely encounter at the worst (and most frantic) moments, such as rushing headlong into a trap while trying to aim at a critical target during a speedrun.- A very minor con, but for a game that emphasizes speedrunning so much, it's annoying to have to sit through various animations and cutscenes every time you attempt a run.  These don't count towards your overall time, and should be confined to the ""normal"" game.- The level-select hub is a chaotic sprawl that doesn't improve the overall experience, and essentially makes choosing (or simply finding) specific levels more work than it should be.OTHER NOTES:* Not a huge fan of the art style--the general flatness and large spans of solid color remind me too much of a free flash game, which cheapens the experience for me.  There are little touches that stand out, such as the bublous green mutations that give a sense of transparency and depth, but they almost feel out of place next to everything else."

Being a platformer veteran, I find the difficulty ramp up at a desirable speed and amount to excitement. Controls are fluid and not at all buggy, and the levels offer the perfect flow along the way. Be prepared though -- it's a game that does not abuse checkpoints for you to nibble through a level.If I have to be picky, I'd like to see height-adjustable jumps in this game. But the current settings are just great already.A masterpiece in all."

It's definitely worth the $12 if you're into platforming.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a fluid 2D platformer like Super Meat Boy, Ori an the Blind Forest, and etc (although Splasher isn't nearly as hard as some of those).  The motion feels natural, the level design is good, and everything flows very well.  You can see the basics in the video; I won't go into that stuff.My biggest problem with the game is that they made poor choices with the controls (on a controller) in my opinion.  First, ""move"" and ""aim"" are both done with the left control stick.  I don't know if there's a better solution, but it's uncomfortable.  Sometimes you want to be able to aim at the ground while you run forward or drift to the left while shooting to the right.  Most annoyingly, sometimes you want to stand still while you aim your shot.  I found it a bit frustrating.  (However, this mechanic does add a lot of interesting optimizations into a speedrun.)Second, there are three projectiles you can shoot and you can only shoot one of them at a time so those three things are mapped to X, Y, and B.  That much makes sense (conveniently, the colors of those buttons match the color of the corresponding projectile).  The problem is that jump is mapped to A (like basically every platformer ever) so that your right thumb is responsible for both jumping and shooting which makes it hard to do both at the same time.  Toward the end of the game you often find yourself switching quickly between the three projectiles and jumping often which further compounds the difficulty.  For me, this is actually a big problem.Incidentally, I own the steam controller and I hardly ever use it but it does a great job of mitigating these things.  I remapped the projectiles to the two triggers and right bumper so that my right thumb only jumps and it works great.  Also, it takes some adjustment but the fake d-pad/trackpad on the left thumb of the steam controller works pretty well in place of the left control stick.The speedrunning modes are a lot of fun.  There are three of them and they're a really interesting way to lengthen a game that might have been short on content otherwise.  I've already spent a lot of time pushing my way through the selfish speedrun mode (my personal favorite) even though I'm terrible at it.  It should be mentioned, though, that the in-game speedrunning modes are casual and will likely never be made official.  For some inexplicable reason the timer stops when you pause the game which means that official categories will likely use real time (although I'm not an expert).Overall this is a really fun game.  It's a well-made platformer with an interesting gimmick.  Also, I only bought the game because I saw GrandPooBear playing it on twitch, which he commanded me to mention in my review.  :)"
