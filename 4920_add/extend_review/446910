,Recommended,446910,22437570,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Flutter Skye,"Night Blights is a ""Horror"" Game, which at first glance looks really similiar to FNaF4, however it came out originally before FNaF4 did, and the game itself is completely different.I've originally played this game when it was released on Gamejolt, and it was a really great experience. The Steam version is a lot more polished, has more features, and is in general a lot better, that's why I recommend buying it.Now, the ""horror"" here isn't supposed to be taken COMPLETELY seriously. The game can be scary, however it focuses more on gameplay mechanics, that being scary. So if you're looking for the same horror experience  like in Amnesia or SOMA, you're out of luck.Now, each night of the game, it becomes harder, and more ways for the Blights to enter your house are added. You will have to take strategies to where organize the toys, which path should you take first if a Blight is about to enter from 2 different entrances, and such. The fact that you have to constantly do things, or you will die, is giving a lot of tension to the game, making it more exciting, and adds to the scary factor. This game, I can guarantee, is not a jumpscare fest.During the nights, various things can happen, such as a painting falling, or a Blight just staring at you from the top of a staircase. These little things add a lot to games like this, and make it a lot better.There's also a Survival mode and Free Roam mode here, which gives the game more replayability, so you can come back to it just to play for fun and try to survive the longest.In other words, Night Blights is a Horror game which focuses more on the gameplay factor than the horror, and in result provides great gameplay, with simple, yet good mechanics.So if you like the FNaF Games, or just want a small bit of scares, I recommend this game greatly. I only have less than a hour on Steam as of right now, but I spent a lot of time on the Gamejolt version, and I definitely say its worth it."

Night Blights is fun, its challenging, and it is way more polished than other games like it. This is not a jump scare simulator and it is not a super serious horror game. Also, this is not a FNAF rip off or a ""puzzle horror"" game that becomes easier once you figure out the pattern. Night Blights is a fun and slightly creepy survive-the-night game that will most likely scare you at some point.  It is worth every penny of the $4.99 price. I give it maybe a week before this thing blows up, so buy it now before it goes viral and the price goes up."

,Recommended,446910,28112056,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,Celery V. Green,"Night Blights is a very fun, and charming, little horror game. It pulls off being simultaneously cute and stress-inducing so well, as the things you must manage drastically increase with each night. If you like jumpscare-based games, this one might be for you.You play as a child who must defend yourself and your family from the gremlin-like Night Blights prowling around your home. You do this by closing doors, pressing various switches, and many other things each night. The game relies heavily on audio and sound cues, so playing with headphones is very much recommended.No matter how much I've played that Survival Mode to get that top score, the game still manages to make me paranoid when I do play it. My favorite part of the game is the amount of random little things there are to troll you; random things may open or appear to freak you out, or to open areas that you might not get a chance at on a different attempt. There's also many, many Easter eggs to other horror games and movies as well. The dev did a wonderful job on this cute little game, and while it may get a bit frustrating at times, it's overall quite silly and fun; I think it deserves a bit more attention than it gets here on Steam."

The steam version on the other hand, has more lights, to feed the night blights, and has some new fetures such as having to close the fridge. Overall I think they did a pretty good job, especially for a school project. Definitally worth the money!"

76561198096079278,Recommended,446910,32906720,Posted: 27 June,all,FriendFive,"Haven't gotten too deep into this, but it's ok. I think I am over my brief foray into horror games. This game has the mechanics that I think FNAF should have had. I think I might have actually liked FNAF if it played like Night Blights. The two games share in common the concept of keeping monsters out. But I found the gameplay in FNAF to not be very engaging. In this game, at least you can move around the environment. You have to perform different actions to block out the monsters. You also have to collect and stockpile toys to feed to the night Blights to appease them. I think I actually like this game more because it reminds me of how much I hate FNAF. Now I realize the sequels to FNAF might have added more involved gameplay, but I'll never know, I checked out after the first game."
76561198061116835,Recommended,446910,22574415,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,Realafah,"Its a pretty fun game. Usually when games scare me, especially when jumpscares are normal, I either just watch it and admire it from afar, or play it for a little bit before just stopping and and end up not playing it that much. With this game however, I find it to be so fun and challenging that I'll risk the jump scares because I feel like it's worth it when I survive the night. I also love the little easter eggs that are in the game. Everytime I play it, I find a new one and I just admire that the time was taken just to put a little easter egg like it in the game. The only complaint I have is that I can't look further down because if I stand right next to a toy, I have to walk away in order to pick it up. This is a major problem when I have to give a toy to a blight immediately, but I have to take the time just to step back and pick it up instead of looking more down and getting it. Other than that, the game is absolutely wonderful and I'm glad I bought it."

It's honestly not quite as ""scary"" as I'd hope for, but its pretty fun trying to survive the nights and protect your little baby bother.  Each night of the week gets progressively harder with more things to watch for being added each night such as shutting the toilet if a blight tries to come up through the toilet, and bellowing the fire to keep them from coming down the chimney.  Gotta stay alive each night from 11pm to 7am, and it keeps you busy!  ..No just standing there waiting like in the first FNAF.  It's fun!Also the book that you read is awesome and fun to read as it talks about the new threats each night in a cool poetic fashion.Easily worth the $4.99 USD asking price!  One of the better FNAF games I've played on Steam!  Recommended to FNAF fans for sure!"

I have been playing it since a little after the alpha release on Gamejolt, and even did a playthrough of that version on my Youtube Channel. I have thouroughly enjoyed it, and have played it up until now. I just bought it, and have to say that this is harder than the original, but it is much more detailed. It is truly a terrifying experience, and would reccomend it for anyone looking for a casually terrifying game to play.Here is a link to my original playthrough:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbmJwJeeSZ3IEz7hfcOojIfHNn5dbFjzE"

Not only has the game somehow disabled itself?!- it says that a newer game version is available and my copy has been disabled- the email I sent to Night Blights support has been bounced back. The email account simply doesn't seem to exist. It won't update, I've spent about 4 hours verifying and making sure it wasn't an error on the account of my computer. I deleted and redownloaded the game files, restarted my system, cleared out some uneccesary data.Then I changed the update for Night Blights to high priority, but it won't work and what I wanted to be fun has become severely frustrating. Until this issue is fixed, I feel obligated to warn people away from downloading the game. Stick to the demo version over on GameJolt for the time being until this gets fixed.UPDATE:The problem is now fixed. Kudos to the developers for responding so quickly to the problem, although, seeing how their update system penalizes people possesing older copies of the game, it does detract from my overall enjoyment. Regardless, I think it's time I talk about what I love about Night Blights.Although one could draw comparisons between this game and Five Nights at Freddies, it's clearly paved it's own path from it's horror-genre cousin. Playing this game always keeps you on your toes, as you listen to audio cues signaling which location you'll need to quickly visit. Constantly bombarded by creatures called Night Blights, keeping you or your family safe is no easy feet.In this game, you control and direct the movement of a child. Level game play is also directed by a mysterious book detailing your gruesome encounters in common storybook fashion. Our poor protaginist seems to never be able to catch a break, since staying awake all night to fend of murderous and mischivious creatures must be quite taxing.All around, it features a unique style of game play, with penalizing consequences for ignoring gameplay ques. Although lacking player custimization, it does boast an immersive environment with hidden suprises to continue its underlying sense of dread. Overall, I would recommend to a friend. In this game, it helps to be strategical, and keep the fire lit."
