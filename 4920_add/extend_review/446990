This one was free but the remaining 4 episodes are $5 each; which I am seriously considering since I really dig this game! You are Elisabeth a girl who must leave the farm and embark on an epic and perilous journey to find her brothers.This visual novel blends perfectly with card/turn based combat and RPG elements; I’ve never been into card based games but this may have changed my mind. The graphics and story are both well done and I can't seem to get enough of this game! I wish the first episode was longer! I love the use of the map; it's interactive and serves as your hub for travel, quests and character items and gear.Worth $5; this first episode is free. I'm hoping the remaining 4 prove as fruitful! Update soon(EDIT): Just completed the Fifth episode and I was equally if not more impressed. The length was about 2 hours which I was pleased with for about $4! This game still has me hooked; if you enjoyed the first grab this on sale!

76561198138437975,Recommended,446990,32812135,Posted: 26 June,all,MirandaKym,"This is an amazingly fun game. The first chapter of 5 is free but the rest will cost you. Not sure if they're worth the asking price but when they're on sale, definitely worth it.The Huntsman: Winter's Curse is a turn-based RPG where the skills you use are based on a deck of cards. Every piece of equipment you use (weapon, armor, and 2 accessories) will give you access to a different set of cards and sometimes a special bonus (or negative effect). So there's a lot of strategy in what you decide to equip. On the same page where you choose your equipment is also a skill tree. Everytime you level up, you get to choose one perk - all passive.Battles, as I've said, are turn-based. There's a bar on the top of the screen that your characters and the enemies move along and get an action at the end of. Many cards have effects that push the enemies back on the bar. Of course, they can do the same to you. You get 3 cards to pick from (you can only choose one) each time you can perform an action. They're random. As soon as you use one, another random one will take its place. Some of the perks on the skill tree will allow you access to more cards in each hand - for a total of 5. It's definitely nicer to have more choices. At the end of a fight, all your HP is refilled. (YAY) I really loved the battles.The art in this game is lovely and the music is pleasant though there's not much variation.The story.... it's interesting, to be sure. But the main characters always seem to be bickering so I kinda want to smack them. Still, I'm enjoying the journey. Throughout the plot, you get to make many decisions and I'm sure these affect how much exp you get sometimes and items you can find. At some point, I'm sure I'll play this again just to see what different choices offer. I've completed 4 of the 5 chapters so I can't tell you if the ending of the story is any good. Let's hope so!This is not an action game in any form. It's strategy all the way. This has been one of the more enjoyable games I've played this year so I definitely recommend it. Oh, a heads-up for achievement hunters. All you have to do to 100% the game is play through all 5 chapters. That's it.Additional: I played the game again, making different decisions and using different strategies. I can indeed attest to the fact that decisions matter. They change exp gained and what items you may or may not get. They determine how many enemies you face or if you face any at all. It was neat to see the differences. I really love this game."
,Recommended,446990,23305975,"Posted: 31 May, 2016",all,Ayuri,"The Huntsman : Winter's Curse is a surprising gem in a fairytale universe, totally worth its price in my opinion. The first book is free to play : a perfect way to make your own opinion about it. And since this is a fairytale, your steam wallet will magically decrease in order to purchase the season pass. Remember : magic always comes with a price.I am not fond of narrative games, but this one is so much more than that, I just fell in love with its unique type. The story is about Elisabeth, a stubborn girl who used to live in a farm with her father and decides to leave her village to start her own adventure. Her brothers left home years ago and it's time for her to look for them and discover what happened to them. During her journey, she will meet many good or evil characters / monsters. Many dangers await but sometimes, fear and inner self are the worst enemies.But this isn't only a narrative and interactive game : it has several RPG principles. The game is linear, with a few side quests and choices to make (actions and dialogues). Your characters will get experience from the fights and quests and you'll have to manage their ability trees and inventory. The turn-based combat system is quite special and interesting : every character has skill cards depending on their equipment. Up to you to find the most effective combinations to get rid of your opponents. However, the combats aren't too challenging, except the final boss.One does not review The Huntsman : Winter's Curse without mentioning its beautiful and elaborate art style : unique, refreshing, a personal and authentic touch. The soundtrack is also particularly pleasant ; wouldn't mind to pay for a soundtrack edition (edit : there is a soundtrack DLC now !).This game is simply mesmerizing, captivating and worth playing. I sincerely hope that Desert Owl Games, LLC will come back with other gems."

I bought the season pass after playing the first episode, and so far have played three episodes in total. The plot as well as the characters are all interesting, if not slightly cliche. But that doesn't really bother me as I don't mind hearing a familiar story again as long as it's told well. Also, something I really like is the fact that you can change the story based on your choices. I don't actually think your choices affect the main story, but it's nice to have the illusion of choice, I guess!I am a huge fan of turn-based combat systems, and this game happens to have turn-based combat. During battle, you choose skill cards which you get by equipping items you pick up through the story. I liked this system, since it allowed you to mix things up whenever you wanted. I found it quite difficult to find a good skill card combination, and a lot of the time while in battle I was stuck with cards that I didn't want to use. I don't think this game is too difficult - I played it on the default difficulty setting and managed to get through the game without dying. You can switch the difficulty however, if you want more or less of a challenge, although I am not sure what that would be like.Finally, there were one or two things that annoyed me. When allocating ability points on the character page, I couldn't see the descriptions as the fonts were too small. A lot of things on that page were basically kind of glitchy. Besides that, you can't save your game. It automatically saves, and once you do something it is done forever. A few times, I wanted to see if choosing a different choice would change the outcome but I couldn't. While that sort of save system makes sense for some games, I don't really think it's neccessary here."

Gameplay is a bit of an odd duck, harder than that of most VN, but simpler than that of most straight-up card games. There's still enough depth to it that I did not find it too boring over the 10 or so hours of the game, but I was really playing this for the story more than the game play.The art is great, the story and characters are decent and entertaining enough. A bit expensive perhaps for the amount of game, but I would recommend it if on sale."

Then stop. You've seen everything!+ Don't blame this game if you'd prefer depth and complexities.

76561198029904609,Recommended,446990,32795826,Posted: 25 June,all,bear_storm,"Winter's Curse is really pretty to look at. There's a lushness to the art that reminds me of Child of Light, and a consistent, immersive dark-and-beautiful feel to the visuals.Unfortunately, that's almost all there is.Winter's Curse does deserve some praise for all the ways it doesn't fall on its face as a licensed game. It isn't just a re-tread of Huntsman movie stuff. It develops its own characters, independant from the ones in the franchise. It also builds its combat system around a few simple gimmicks that, nonetheless, are pretty fun. Most in-game encounters come with dialog choices, most of which feel meaningful.Winter's Curse's problem is that, apart from the art, it doesn't really excel anywhere. Equipping new items is fun, but then the inventory starts to fill with cloggy nonsense. Battles load quick and look nice, but combat feels a bit draggy after the third encounter. The art brings the setting to life, but the writing sometimes undercuts it. The first piece of the game is free, but it's also the most generic part. Things pick up considerably in the following chapters.I can't bring myself to condemn Winter's Curse for only being kinda fun, though. Still, there's such a wide swathe of other games out there that I can't really urge people to jump on it either.If you like the art style, you like lighter RPGs, you don't need a game's writing to be Planescape: Torment caliber, and you want the opportunity to frantically spam makeouts on your sorcerer companion in hopes of ""breaking his curse"", this is a pretty reasonable buy. I wouldn't pick it up for full price unless you *know* it's going to be your jam, but having bought it at ten bucks, I don't have any regrets."

This characters, weapons, armors, enemies, and backgrounds are very pleasant to the eyes. The music and sound effects fit the environments, although not very impressive.The combat system is a traditional turn-based RPG mode combined with a card management system, where all items you equipped provide their respective cards to form a drawing pool for use in the battle, and your hand available in the current turn is drawn from the pool. This system is neither innovative nor well-balanced, but it works well for the game. Character building is interesting at first, but becomes monotonic in the late game since you will reach top level at the beginning of the fifth book if you finish all the side quests (only a handful throughout the whole game, and not tightly connect to the main story).As regards the story, I would say it is quite short, bland, straightforward. Each book took me about one hour to finish.Overall, the aspect of visual representation is the predominate reason for recommending this game, while the other part are just at an average level.Since the first book is free to try, if you like the art style after a taste, you can buy the other books during a discount."
,Recommended,446990,24004514,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,hymnomancy,"When I first tried out The Huntsman: Winter's Curse, I did not know what to expect. Video games based on movie franchises usually tend to be lower quality, but this game was actually pretty great. It felt like a combination of a visual novel and a card game. The battle card game is not something complicated, it is a simple but fun one. The difficulty throughout the game was pretty good. Sometimes it could get kind of difficult if the character was alone in battle against multiple enemies, but it was doable. However, the final boss fight was nearly impossible. I got game over around 6 times with different equipment combinations until I gave up and changed my game setting to Easy, which felt horrible, to be honest. You can’t really level up much in this game after doing all the side quests, so I was stuck on what to do. I believe I was at the max level with all characters. Anyway, I finally defeated the Enchantress. I don’t know if I messed up somewhere in the story, but the battle system had 3 slots for characters and I only had 2 max at all times, so there’s that tidbit.When it comes to the story, I really did enjoy this game. The story was a nice fairy tale-like one, not too complicated but good enough, in my opinion. I really liked the main characters—Elizabeth and Marcus. Although, Elizabeth did get on my nerves at times when she kept going against Marcus’s advice.I mean, he had gone through the enchantress’ curse, so of course he knew what could happen to Elizabeth and her brothers!Yet, she just kept doing her thing, even though it ended up badly most of the time. I’m not sure how much the choices in the game actually affected the story, but I did feel like I messed up a couple of times when making choices. In the end, the game did have a nice ending, although I feel like it was a bit abrupt. I would have liked a bit more closure to it. Overall, this was a fun game and one I’d recommend, especially if you get the season pass! It’s very nice and well worth the price. I hope this developer makes more games like this. Story rich games are fun and the added battle card mechanism was very enjoyable! I’m looking forward to more games like this one."

Also for some reason the game is kind of obscure, I've only seen it for the first time in the depths of my recommendation queues. A shame, really, this game deserves attention much more than piles of trash being relentlessly advertised on Steam.So, The Huntsman: Winter's Curse is essentially a linear visual novel with battles. Looks and feels like something in between Banner Saga and Child of Light. I purchased this game on a discount and I believe those were money well spent. I love the overall style, the visuals, the music too. The game uses a rather unqiue combat system where instead of actions you play cards and those cards are provided by various equipment, so changing equipment allows you to modify your ""deck"". An interesting idea, it actually shows promise and can be used in other games of similar type.  Although, of the battles themselves I have to say they are not terribly exciting, mostly because all you need to do is click a card once in every 5-10 seconds. Also the very theme of dark fairy tales is getting really, really old. Certain cliches and tropes are very much apparent in the story. However, nothing is entirely new nowadays and the story itself isn't bad at all. It is well written, happily avoiding some common pitfalls like using modern slang or making characters talk like idiots.All in all, I enjoyed playing this game. Check it out if you're into such things, especially since the first chapter is free, so everyone can make their own opinion."

That particularly was one of the things that caught my eye about this game, and I'm glad that feeling carried through the gameplay.I'm not sure if other visual novels have similar combat mechanics, or even have combat at all for that matter, but it's that typical type of turn-based card game that I also really haven't played a lot of. I think it fit very well with the game, however, and also seemed to pace the story in a way.I was also very surprised by how much you could customize the main character and her companion, from combat gear down to the stats. As an RPG devotee, that was very much appreciated. And also completely unexpected.Each book is a bit short, in that you can probably finish each one in about 20-30 minutes. The first book is free, so I'd definitely try that out before you decide to spend the 5 dollars on each remaining book.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this!"
