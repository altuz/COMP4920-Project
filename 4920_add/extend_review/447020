,Recommended,447020,32401637,Posted: 13 June,all,Sandman,"I honestly don't think I've played the game enough to justify if this is truly a great game but here are all my thoughts anyway...I personally think this game is quite entertaining because I find mowing lawns (with a riding tractor) fun and enjoyable and sometimes feel like I haven't done enough. But this game is far more than mowing a lawn. Let's put down a list of great activities you can do in this game, some of which you can do in previous games too ie FS 15 and FS 13.1. Running a crop farm. Basically means you take out your planting machines (sowing machines, not to be confused with sewing) and cover a field in crops of variation, wait, then take out the according harvesting combine to pick it up and sell the collected crop.2. Mowing lawns. Yes if you really wanted, you can waste time mowing lawns, collecting grass and selling it OR using it to feed your animals to make a good profit.3. Wood cutting. You can take out whats called a ""Dangle Head"" tree cutter that will cut down and cut up a tree into logs to fit onto a wood trailer to transport them to a log cutting facility, or alternatively you can crunch up the logs into chips and sell them at the heating plant.4. Taking care of animals. This comes down from #2 where you can take care of cows, sheep, or pigs in order to produce manure from pigs and cows to help with #1. Sheep only take water and grass in order to produce wool which can be transported to a spinnery for good profit. Cows are a bit more difficult but quite rewarding in the long run but are fed a mixture of silage, grass, and straw along with water. Pigs, to be honest, I don't mess with them only because I don't feel the need, but theres a whole guide explaining what you need to do with caring for animals.If you don't really find much of that appealling then lets go over some features that were added since FS 15.1. Built in Mod Hub. Yes this game offers a built in mod menu with a ton of mods made by the community.2. Free dumping of crops or seed or whatever. This means that if you got a trailer full of lets say, wheat, you can dump it pretty much where ever you want and pick it back up later, this applies to all things that can be put in a tipper.3. Enhanced graphics. I know that the graphics in most cases aren't that much different from FS 15 but there is a noticable improvement that makes the game feel more alive. Plus better attention to detail when it comes to the tractors and equipment.4. More tractors and equipment such as Fendt, Challenger, and Massey Ferguson. And larger equipment such as the Amazone Condor sowing machine that has a massive span of 15m compared to earlier games such as FS 15 with the Horsche Pronto sower being the biggest in that game with having a span of only 9m.In conclusion, I think this game is great if you are looking to relax and learn a little bit on certain activities played by real farmers around the world. Theres a ton more features that I can think of but would just make this review too long if I go more."

They just added some more mods that make the suspension realistic. I highly recommend. Wooho They just added a Mustang GT too. =)Major+Graphics are improved & lighting is a lot better.Major+Constant 60 fps running a 770 gtx...Major+Now you can acquire jobs and make extra money from other local farmer that own fields in singleplayer. They usually give you pretty expensive harvesters to play around with too.Major+Seamless keyboard , mouse +  Controller usage.

However, given that I own FS2015, I find it hard to justify my purchase of FS2017. I gave a stellar review to FS2015 and this is a ""slight"" improvement over it - so if you don't own FS2015, you should definitely get this. But yearly iterations of games with little added value has become a sort of trend in the gaming industry and it's not something I can justify myself encouraging."

76561197994775629,Recommended,447020,26574157,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Ravinoth,"10/10 Strongly recommended.A focus that I'll put on my comments here is that there is the ability to perform work on other farmers fields. Having put a nice chunk of time into FS 2013 back in the year 2012, I had spent a lot of time performing chores, then setting the clock to run at 120x speed, while I waited to perform a harvest. Eventually I could diversify the operation which could keep me busy longer, but it took a very long time to accumulate the equipment necessary.In 2017, money is very easy to acquire by performing work on other farmers fields. So far I've put about 18+ hours into the game and I've already accumulated well over $300,000 in the first day of “game time”.There's so much money to be made doing this that while there are reasons why I would want to advance time, such as accumulating a couple harvests to have enough food to get into animal tending, I don't feel the need to.By being able to pull in significant chunks of money fairly quickly, I am now quickly planning how I can get into logging and purchasing bigger fields alongside my plans for tending to animals. In 2013, it was a long slog to get new machines that would make things a bit easier. I'm sure some people exploited things or used cheats to make cash fast, but I wasn't on board with doing that myself.Overall I feel that the mission design allows the player to put time into the game and get easily apparent rewards that facilitates the player's quest to become more deeply acquainted with the various features of the game.Besides that, there have been huge upgrades to the graphics since 2013, which is to be expected but casual fans like myself who got on the FS train back in 2012 will be pleased with the new details and animations. Zooming in on various machines while they work is a treat, with soil being deformed and pushed aside, or corn rows being drawn into a corn harvest header. I also really like how machines get dirty and can even be cleaned by cleaning equipment that is operated by the player. Even the interior cabins of machines will have dirty boot prints as you get in and out of them with dirty boots.Controls wise, I've used KB+Mouse and found them to be great. I am currently using an Xbox 360 controller while sitting on the couch using a TV instead of my monitor and it's even more enjoyable. I have a G27 steering wheel setup but I enjoy sitting back on the couch with this game so I don't feel the need to deepen the simulation with that controller setup. I'm glad that it supports that hardware if I feel so inclined in the future though!Overall, I find that these games really offer a deep experience of getting to know your farms, your equipment and building a farming empire. The tutorials are very easy to understand (I didn't need most of them but I did some of them anyway) and I liked how they easily allowed me to perform the steps with the game's equipment so I could see what type of hardware I might buy and how I would use it for my in-game farm when I'm ready. New players shouldn't have too much trouble if they have free time and some interest. I find it's really neat to get involved with the farming simulator world, much more immersion than a lot of the shooters and other games which offer transient game experiences.I haven't tried multiplayer but it's a welcome addition. From viewing YouTube videos it really appears to be a great way to play and something you might really enjoy. I personally like coming home from work and loading up the farm and getting some stuff done whenever I want; without having to coordinate with friends. So MP is less of a thing for me, but once again, a welcome feature.I tend to marvel at little things in the game, like using a front-end loader to pick up bales or using a shovel to scrape up a pile of something off of the ground. The fact that the game simulates piles of materials is neat. Although I find it slightly bothersome that I can't shift in my seat while using the virtual cockpits; it would be nice to shift around and see different angles while seated. That would help operate multiple different types of machines. Although being able to look around the cockpit is nice enough and popping in and out of third person isn't a problem anyway.This game really is a deep experience that rewards the player and gives a sense of satisfaction that most games can't. It's also nice to play a game where the world is at peace and one's only worries is how will they spend their day at their beautiful farm."

The option of cruise mode is a welcome addition also.Multiplayer works great but unfortunately I couldn't get missions to work, I've now gathered that this is intentional, its a real shame as it makes the multiplayer much harder to earn decent money but I'm sure it'll be adressed eventually.Worth the £30 at the moment, much better than 15 and will surely swallow hundreds of hours of my time."
,Recommended,447020,26209548,"Posted: 24 October, 2016",all,LudicrousFox,"Well what can i say about Farming Simulator 2017, amazing..simple amazing. After spending about 1800 hours in fs15 i can  say ive seen alot of interesting stuff, the great equipment, the modding, and the great community. the moment i loaded up fs17 i noticed the vast improvement on graphic options, the ability to use Track Ir, and the Automatic setup and detection of gamepads and steering wheels.Loading into the game was incredibly fast, and there it was Goldcrest in all its glory, i spent about 45 minutes just driving around and taking in the sights, and driving the trains.As i started my career i noticed big improvment on drive quality of the vehicles,the environmental lighting and road noise.....road noise from the transition of hard pavement to the gravel dirt roads. Every sound is different, from the combine reving high...to the moment you begin to combine your crops and you hear the revs go deeper as you begin to swath. all little details that make Fs17 great to begin with.From inspecting fields and seeing that you can work to improve relationship with farmers that own fields and do work for then to bring the price down, so its cheaper for you to buy later on. I spent a good ten minutes looking for a spot to fill my seeder when i realize i had to buy seed and purchase extra pallets of fertilizer, something that was left out of fs15 (except in Modding) this all adds to the overall experience of the game. I have still alot to explore, and found that buying livestock you no longer have to click to buy animals but rather buy and transport them to your farm. Fs17 has made leaps and bound in the Farming simulation catagory, I cant wait to see what else is in store for the future. Great Job Giants Keep up the great work.Twitch.tv/Ludicrousfox"

Buy a solar collector3/ The first solar collector will bring in good money.  Then pay back a bit of loan and buy another solar collector4/ Do this until you have about 15 collectors.  Then buy a wind turbine5/ Finish up with about 5 wind turbines.The above will take about a day or maximum 2 days.  Run it at night.Then you will be earning millions and you can dial back the time to 5x and go and enjoy yourself."

76561198050433002,Recommended,447020,29131774,Posted: 8 January,all,rcjenn40,"TL;DR: The best farming simulator out today.With that out of the way, I honestly didn't want this game, even though I absolutely love the Farming Simulator series. Check my time played in FS 13 & 15 if you don't believe me. I was very happy with FS 15 and didn't want to chase that carrot of constantly having to replace it every year or so anymore. Seriously.And even recieving FS 17 as a gift for the holdays I resisted downloading it and playing it til today, Jan. 8th. I did though, hoping it was too close to FS 15, so I could just refund it and put the money in my Steam wallet for some future game or DLC.Well...after playing it for six hours straight, I logged out, and uninstalled FS 15 without a second thought to all my work there. FS 17 really is that much better than the previous games in the series, in every single way except one. Where the frick is my potato and sugar beet storage!?!Anyway...with more crop choices (which I've wanted forever), more animal choices (including breeding), the fact the base game has pretty much all the DLCs of FS 15 included,better ground textures (which my old eyes have been needing),higher detailed and animated machines...heck they even have working radio's,a more vibrant, living community now that all of the other plots of land are owned by other farmers that you can work for both money and to get on their good side for better land purchases....geeze....I could go on and on..So yeah, after playing FS 17 for just one day I knew that this version so far outpaced FS 15 that there was just not going to be any going back and so I removed 15. All that work, but it just didn't matter once I saw all that was available and improved on with 17.So if you're still on the fence and reading reviews to see if you want to finally make the switch, take it from me, someone who didn't actually want to play this game and was very happy where I was in FS 15...it's worth it.... Geeze, can't believe I'm saying this, but yeah, it is...."

I work in the forestry business for a living and find this addition to the game the most fun part for me. Its not perfect, but it got the basic feel to it. With the propper mods it becomes even better.I think what really gets to me is the variety of different tools you can use. All from basic tractors and tools to forestry harvesters and on to transportation veichles. Many people who does things like this for a living, like me, find it interesting to try on other stuff then one normally would do.I recommend that to really get something of the propper feeling out of this game you should at least get a steering wheel and pedals. If you do forestry, get dual joysticks.The three things I want to see the most for the upcomming new version:- VR support- Better physics- Better multiplayer stability"

It is well worth its prize and if you own Farming Simulator 15, just like I do, changes really justify buying it. I can heartily recommend it.Pros1. High-end graphics that are very stable and not demanding.2. Enough machines and equipment to make your head spin, and what's more, most of them are further customizable, and even more - there are countless mods available directly from the game's menu.3. Three kinds of animals for you to buy, transport, and feed, each with their own requirements. Also - chicken that require nothing and still provide you with fresh eggs to sell in the town.4. There is a fully simulated train for you to use and drive around.5. Maps are pretty nice and immersive.6. Missions for other farmers where you have to help them with different tasks is a nice touch and a great way to end some additional money in the early game.7. There is an in-game radio, although I still prefer my own collection of John Denver.8. There are many options to customize your experience, mainly game's difficulty. Mods provide additional options.Cons1. Physics can be hilarious.2. Your helpers get stuck way too easily, and when getting around the obstacle is no brainer at all.3. There are very few AI cars driving around and drivers are morons."

(not far but still, plus a train horn...)+ Equipment lights now can be turned on AT THE SAME TIME! (front and back)+ AI helpers are slightly less incompetent (fewer crashing into trees, somewhat better at angled fields)+ Pigs! (Either you like bacon or you're wrong)+ More customization of buidling placement (upgrades for silo storage)+ Upgrades to machinery (mostly different tires, more power, some different paint jobs)+ Tiedowns for log transportation+ Missions available on fields you don't own, a good way to start making moneySome things that I would say could be improved upon:- Better NPC AI (cars reacting to you, people not walking out in front of equipment in town, etc.)- Helpers stopping at angled fields still an issue- Trees fall through the map if cut low- More maps (there is only two, one is the same as in FS15)The last feature that can either be a positive or a negative is that when you reset equipment, it resets to the store. If you like realism, this feature is good for you; also makes trailers hauling equipment more viable. For me I find it slightly annoying when I get stuck on a tree with a combine, then reset, and spend a couple minutes at 16 mph back to the field.If you liked Farming Simulator 15, 17 is worth the cost."

76561198140359787,Not Recommended,447020,33274276,Posted: 5 July,all,TangoFoxtrott,"Having played FS15 already for many hours (1000+), i have mixed feelings about FS17. Yes, the developer ""optimized"" several things, the graphics look better, overall performance is better, Multiplayer is more forgiving. But where there is light there is also darkness. The performance increase (especially in Multiplayer) came at some cost with sync between players. Players don't see the same stuff anymore. For example the AI Traffic. One player sees several vehicles in front of him, while somebody else sees absolutely nothing. Emptying the manure heap at the cow stables updates several minutes (!!!) later in the Menu. This is ridiculous.Modding became a pain in the neck. While Giants published the Sourcecode in previous versions, this time they decided to only write a incomplete function description. There was no information at all from Giants about some important changes in the game (like the new storage system). It just was so painful to create new maps. The forums from Giants are there, but no involvement from Giants. Not one answer on how things changed or worked now.And let's be honest, Giants made some improvements to the underlying engine, but you do notice that it just opened a can of worms at other ends. The engine is so pretty much at its end of life.It appears though that Giants focused this time much more on the consoles, for PC Players the game is more of a slap in the face. I don't care if the PS4 doesn't support modding the same way a PC does. I don't care about the politics behind Sony's decision. But you get a crippled product because of this. I am a PC Player, so don't take away the ability to mod the living hell out of this game just because the mods wouldn't work on a PS.The modding community is slowly on a decline. If you take a look at the main modding site (No, not Modhub from Giants itself, the other one) you will find the 500th version of the standard map ""Goldcrest Valley"", a tree moved to the side and a ""new"" map on modhoster. There are tons of converted mods from LS15 which more or less are full of bugs, lots of re-skins etc. All in all just crap. Real innovative mods are missing this time. Shame, but it is a sign of the changed modding support of this game.But...it is still fun to play FS17, as long as you figured out how to work around several of the issues.If Giants does carry on the path with the next version of FS i have to say that the FS17 will be the last version i bought.BTW the upcoming CnC is, from what i saw so far, several years behind the FS in the development stage. So don't hold your breath.I am not sure how i should rate the game, there are several good aspects (also compared to previous versions) but i can't agree with the path Giants chose this time. I therefore decide to not recommend the game anymore. Hopefully it will change with the next version again."

I felt their added features lacking, their improvements lacking and overall vision or direction absent. Their DLCs quite often were obvious money grabs, rather than any real addition to a player's farming strategy.Odds are, they were a small but up and coming software development team which accomplished what they could, considering they were also creating smaller versions of the game for the Android and iOS platforms. Maybe they were spread too thin.This year, they release FS17 with a $45 price tag, up from $27 in the past and I couldn't help but facepalm myself. I sarcastically thought, ""Let me guess, we'll have MORE TRACTORS"" as a way to justify the new cost.24 literal gameplay hours into it, and I have to say, it has caught up to most of my expectations. Kudos for bringing this game up to speed and making it worth the $45. It's about time.The game mechanics haven't changed a whole lot. It seems like midway through FS15, before they fleshed out all the bugs, they cloned it and started making FS17. This would explain a lot of the bugs that were resolved late in FS15 showing up in FS17. Currently, the ""jitter bug"" prevents me from doing forestry unless I use autoload trailer mods.So what's the deal?Missions have changed. Previously we had delivery and mowing missions. I didn't mind the delivery ones, but they were sorta boring. The mowing missions I enjoyed. They're now gone, which I don't think is right. They should come back and with more variety.Now, we have missions where we are maintaining other farmer's fields. Thing is, you can't hire anyone to do it. You have to do it yourself. I would prefer to be able to hire, even if it meant it would cut into my profit.There are a few more crops, 1 more live stock (pigs), chickens haven't changed and lots of tractors. There are even two useless trains. Well, useless on the Goldcrest Valley map. Two little loops around the center of the map. Regardless, it will make for great maps by the modders. Goldcrest Valley is an awful map. How is it that modders make better maps?Despite my gripes... I'm really addicted to this game."

Much more to offer then I thought it would offer. A huge selection of equipment, Way betters graphics ""I know thats not important""  but they are. A much improved options screen and interface. Vehicles drive so much nicer as well. Made it easier to get some mods. Really like how they implimented the fields being owned by farmers and if you do work for them. You basicly develop a relationship with them. Then they will lower the fields price and give you a deal. Being able to lease equipment was a fantastic idea. Making plowing necassary for a better yield, and having to fertilize every growth stage. If I had 1 complaint. It would be a small one. Like not being able to reset equipment back to the farm. That being said, I couldn't recommend buying this game enough. Looking forward to sinking many hours into this game. Oh yeah!"

And added the FOV slider, custom setting.The game is worth buying on a sale under 25$€ but not for the fixed price of 35$€I think that the console prices of this game are too high, they pay30-40% morethan us on PC but you every game that is on all platforms is like this. Sony and Mircosoft are greedy maybe just a little too much greedy.I give this game a 9.1/10 just because it dosen't have force feedback support which I think is a vital feature.Enjoy the game and you need someone to playwith add me up and maybe we'll play."

The thing that still amazes me is how much they put into this game yet it is so well optimized it doesn't come across as a super complex game with hundreds of fully modelled machinery and facility items. Very much an improvement on the FS15 platform and alot of concepts from existing mods in FS15 ended up becoming reality in FS17 which was really cool to see.Only tiny tiny complaint is it would be cool to see some sort of american train model on the american map rather than a german themed train model on the american map.The train concept is still very cool though, especially with the transload/transfer facilities."

It contains everything from previous games and some additions:- New equipments- equipment customization- new crops- New animals- Animals breeding + trailer for transport- Sligh improvement of graphics- New hub/menu with integrated ""encyclopedia"" so newcomers can understand what to do bettervthan with the old limited tutorialThe problem is for owner of old farming simulator games. All those improvements exist but they are not really major to me. Most of the stuff could have been a DLC for FS15 with a lower price. FS15 already had most of those features as mods. Giants are not renewing their game with some fresh air that much. At least nothing that justify increase on price compared to previous game. Ill play it from time to time but its not going to catch my interest more than FS15 did from FS13.

Do note that even tho im english a 2 year old can spell better an me so sorry for any grammer or spelling mistakes.So what is farming Simulator 17?Farming Sim 17 or FS17 is the latest farming sim game made by Giants who made FS11, 13 and 15. it a Game where you manage and grow a farm (duh) by growing crops handling animals, forest genocide ect. The game has multiplayer, but as i have no friends i have not tested this part out so my review is based on the singleplayer.Key points that stand out:New content: tons of new machines, pigs, 2 new crops ( sunflowers and soy beans), a new map and a russian map from FS15 in aswell. It means that there is a ton a stuff to do or goals to get (in terms of a farming game that it).Engine overhaul: The game's engine had a large update with a new lighting system and general updates like tessellation support, a very good option menu (better an most and it a farming game of all things). The sounds also got a update with mud effects on fields higher quailty engine sounds for the machines, civs talking now and moreTrains: better an TS16 even after paying £3000+ on DLC (side note: why is the farmer in control of the whole train network on the map?)UI: The UI is nice a clean looking with a very helpful help area in the main menu (in phone menu, whatever it called when pressing Esc),I do fine it annoying that if i want to pause the game i have to the 2nd to last panal and press the button, i think they should add a hotkey to pause (IF there is one allready then forgive have yet to find it)there is a hotkey, it the pause button (makes a lot of sense, im an idiot), thanks Hihellobyeoh for telling me!Minor stuff: Worker notifications are very helpful and makes life alot easy as they say when the harvester is full or if they are stuck, you customize your stuff now with new upgrades and colours, missons got a overhaul in that you help others farmers with there field and the more you help the cheaper the field.Mods in this game are very good and supported by Giants with a mod brower, very helpful.There are some issus i feel however:Harvesting missions give to much income, they give you more money an the price to sell their own crops so this should be reducedThe worker AI are awlful at times like going the wrong way on a field or randomly leaving halfway like they are on strike or something or driving off the edge of cilffs if a field is near one. these need to be fixed.Can't change the graphics settings in-game, it 2016 come on now.FoV: there is a way to change it in-game but at 90 in a tractor it the camera is so zoom out and makes me a little confused, maybe a fov for third person(free cam in a tractor) and first person would fix it.There is a radio system in FS17 but don't know how to add radio channels or my own music, would like a in-game help area for that.Ok, so is it worth £30? just get to the dam point retard!OK,OK! If you want a relaxing game to mess around on or to waste time, an intrest in farming, or to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with friends then yes buy it. It is worth the £30 price tag and i find it way more fun an FS13"

Anyway, here are the good and bad points.GOOD:Very high attention to detail: The models in this game are very realistic, slightly better than the previous game but still better.Mod Manager: Although there aren't many mods available on the Mod Manager, there are still enough to make the game noticeably different. I also love how most of the mods are actually by GIANTS and are FREE which is very respectable because if it was any other developer they would have released them as paid DLC.Radio: There are 4 radio stations, Rock, Pop, Electro and Country even though the songlist isn't that big its still a decent improvement and hopefully in the future the ability to add your own songs or a radio mod.New Crops and Vehicles: Its awesome to see new crops in Farming Simulator it obviously adds a lot more realism and at the same time, more work to do.New Maps: Goldcrest Valley and Soznovka. At the moment I have only played on Goldcrest which is a very well laid out map, so I assume Soznovka will be laid out very well too, I just don't like it because it looks very rustic and I prefer modern.Vehicle modifications: This is my favourite addition by far, the ability to modify your vehicles adds a bit more flexibility to the vehicles you buy, althought not every vehicle can be modified there are still a lot that can.BAD:Animal Animations: They aren't really that bad, but they could be a little bit smoother. When the animals walk they sort of judder and the transition from animations are instant but either way they are still not too bad.No Crop damage: This can be rectified by downloading a mod using the in-game mod manager, but it would be nice to see that little bit of realism added by default, it could even be toggleable.Maps: There are only 2 maps, although they are very VERY nice maps, itt would be nice to see more maps by the masters at Giants rather than fan-made. I don't know about you, but the game feels more official when you play on a map made by the devs rather than fans.Well, thats about it, I know I have only played 42.1 hours as of posting this review but thats still a pretty long time in my opinion considering I do play other games too. So again, I highly recommend this game, especially if you have more than one monitor, its really fun to just play this and watch Netflix on another screen, a great way to chill out :D"

,Recommended,447020,26262787,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Wadena,"(I will update this review as new content like DLC's and mods come out)**Updated 10.28.16**Farming Simulator 17 is out and I got 30 hours in the game so far. Time for my Review/opinion of the game:General:At first, FS17 felt like an incremental update to FS15. The gameplay is mostly the same, the controls, the menus and so on. There are of course graphical differences to the menus and they look nice and fresh. The controls can be better tweaked and there is a lot more settings to play around with to get the best personal experience for you.After 30 hours I have come to understand that this version of the ""simulator"" is more, much, much more than just an incremental update.The menus give you a better overview of the various prices, livestock, fields etc. The map is a lot bigger and you actually have to plan ahead before you drive off to get your new tool/equipment at the store which adds to the realism. The same goes for delivering goods on the other side of the map. Is it worth driving all the way over there, or should I wait for the prices to climb a little more somewhere else?-In FS15 I had about 250 mods(!) 50 of wich was ""essential"" and have now been added to the core game. The other 200 or so mods are sure to come to FS17 in due time thanks to the awesome modding community!-So far I'm overall happy with the game and all the new stuff like animals, crops, vehicles and tools. But, there's always room for improvement so I'm listing them below;Positive:- New and fresh feel to the game / ""simulator"".- New vehicles, tools, equipment, crops, animals.- Vehicle handling and sounds are much better.- Vehicle customization.- Better animal handling (they don't magically pop up on the pasture).- Nice big map.- Graphics and lighting are much improved.- Texture and particle systems are also much improved.- Missions! Actual missions to help your fellow farmers.- Plowing/tilling the land finally makes a difference.- Fertilizing up to 3 times finally makes a difference.- Live radio streaming.- So many small and big details have been fixed.Neutral:- Trains? Maybe they will come in handy (I only have 30 hours in the game so far). And I guess it's a little about how you choose to play.- Still no ground deformation. I would have loved to see this in the game.- Sunset/sunrise is still fixed in one location, no East or West...Negative:- Vehicle handling feels a bit ""jerky"" at low speeds, it's not as ""smooth"" as it used to be when trying to precision load a pallet etc.- No preview when customizing vehicles.- No Damage (I can drive off a cliff and keep driving).- Still feels more like an arcade game than a simulator (but a lot of the mods usually fixes that to some extent).- Rain still clips trough buildings (so there is no sense in parking them indoors).Recommended: YES!Rating: 8/10.**Updated 10.28.16**"

Yes, it is hours and hours of fun. There are so many different things to do for everyone, from fieldwork to animal husbandry or logging.FS17 has a lot more base vehicles than FS15 and there are some really shiny and nice new addittions to the game.The game has a lot more to offer, with the new way objects are handled and even trains that can be actually used and driven by players in the game.The FS series has a very large and active modding community, which provides for tons of new vehicles, scripts, buildings, animals etc. etc. and even more importantly new maps.Is it all glorious? No, there are some things that really irritate me personally. A couple of bugs that have been here in FS15 and some new bugs that still have not been solved by the dev team.One of the biggest bugs that currently is bothering a lot of people, is the handling of trees when they are cut down and logs. Trees do not fall down after cutting them, but due to the new scripting of Giants, you have to push them with a vehicle or crane to actually fall down. Also are there still problems with the bounding-boxes of the woodlogs, which provided for some interesting jumping around of units when trying to grab hold or loading the logs onto any vehicle."

I do think it is better, all be it, lots of small tweeks rather than drastic changes.I now play with wheel/pedals coupled with a  game pad and a mouse and I think it transforms the in game experience having these.I think there is still room for improvement in the economy, the ai workers and some aspects of the phyics. I would like to see more in the way of a farm management aspect which on a big farm is more realistic than the owner having to do everything and drive everything to the fields. For example it would be good if you had to employ workers full time, pay them a salary and delegate jobs to them. There could be an office in the yard and a smart phone where you could tell them which tractor to take, which field to go to and what to do, etc.It would also be good if you could buy in stuff in bulk and have it delivered to the farm. things like seed, silage, straw, hay, muck, etc.My main bug bears with 13 and 15 (which on the whole, have been dealt with) were:The fact that you couldn't tip your trailer anywhere apart from the designated areas.The physics for the bales and logs were a joke. You would lift the loader boom up and the bale/log would fly off 10,000 feet in the air.If you could actually manage to get a load onto a trailer, they would soon unload themselves the second you set off. Whilst 17 is an improvement, its still not 100% sorted but its workable with the right equipment.The livestock always felt like a pointless tagged on aspect of the game but in 17 they are very much part of the game.The graphics and physics were lacking and have been improved to a much more acceptable standard.To sum it up. If you bought  FS15, you had to mod the hell out of it to fix or get arround all the anoying things that really should have been dealt with by the game makers as they were all present in Fs13. Fs17 includes a lot of these mods as standard and as a result you spend more time enjoying the game rather than constantly trying to find mods to fix something that really pisses you off.Looking foward to FS2019!"

Me and because it's some of the best zen gaming I've ever played. There's no shooting or getting shot at, no rushing against a time limit, no impending doom or limited ammo. Farming Simulator is chilled out gaming, sure you can have huge farm with tons of stuff going on and rush around managing it or you can just cut some trees down with your trusty chainsaw (of which there are a few to choose from) load the logs into your pickup and sell them at the yard.There's loads (and I mean loads!!) of farm machinery to buy and even more available for free via a very simple to use modding community.

,Recommended,447020,34823509,Posted: 8 September,all,☢_Blargnarg_☢,"This review is coming from somebody who owns FS13, 15, and 17. So I'll be presenting my views for both long time players, and those who haven't owned/played farming simulator before.If you have a real nice computer to run this on, it's almost a work of art- There's detail where you'd least expect it. The gameplay is also wonderful, you have a couple different ""routes"" you can go when it comes to making money; making the biggest farm you can, handling huge heards of animals, or furiously logging. The game also has a pretty sophisticated economy, which takes a lot of variables into consideration, and also makes you think about how you can maximize your return on investment.Compared to previous versions of Farming Simulator, it certainly is an improvement in several categories, including visuals, physics, and general game mechanics. Many people do say that it's not much of an improvement compared to Farming Simulator 15, and I partially agree with them. I feel the part that makes it worth the upgrade would be the assortment of new and improved assets- some things in FS15 just felt poorly put together, meanwhile FS17 offers a wide variety of equipment (with lots of extra options too), all of which brings a new or improved experience to the table.If you own a previous version of FS, I'd suggest watching YouTube videos of FS17 or potentially seeing if a friend can let you play, because my opinion of it being notably better than FS15 may not be the same as your opinion as to how similar it really is, and you can decide for yourself if it really lives up to the hype.If you've never owned/played Farming Simulator before, and you're interested in it, I highly suggest this game for you, (partly because there's no major advantage to purchasing an older version), as it'll be able to provide you with hours of fun (or screwing around), and there probably won't be another version until around 2019."

Example silos in the BGA buggy you empty them there is still silage in them even if they are empty. They had 2 years to get the game together and it looks like they throw it together at the last minute. Another company that just wants money quick. That is what it looks like. Now here comes the people that will leave a comment about this but they want to kiss Giants butt and keep their eyes closed.

If i had one complaint it would be that the economy is far tougher than that of FS15 but It adds to the challenge in a good way. The missions really help out to make cash early game and are more interesting as you are working for other farmers doing farm work for them and helping to reduce the costs of their expensive fields. Animals are pretty fun to manage as it gives you goals to keep up for them to breed and add to your income. All in all a good game especially for those that like financial management and games that the player constantly makes progress.

If you ask me, I am not a farmer and probably don't suit it, but playing Farming Simulator 17 is amazing! You have all different ways of farming such a farming crops, woodchopping, mowing, silage, animals. So today we are going to break it down to the pros and the cons.Pros:Let's start with the woodchopping bit, as you can see the cons of woodchopping are, you can woodchop in this game and it isn't really that hard, there is a variety of woodchopping which is a very nice feature as you can use woodchippers, use a chainsaw and cut it down and put it in your pickup truck by cutting individual pieces that are not to heavy or you can use a skid steer loader with a log fork and pick it up and take it to the sawmill, and you earn a nice bit of money. There is also planting trees with saplings which I find not the biggest feature seen but a very nice smaller feature, especially as you could have a tree farm on a field. There are also trains which can transport logs when you fasten the tension belts as well as these logging machines that are big and can chop trees, transport trees etc. Moving on now, I like they added more crops so it doesn't fell like your doing the same thing every time and all you do is cultivate, sow, harvest and then sell. There is way more purpose for the existence of crops as you can feed pigs with it and I think cows may also need crops because it says ""power food"". Now here is the bit where it can be interesting for you, you can increase your field yield many ways, such as manure, fertilizer spreaders, sprayer and plowing which can be a big bonus, so in the end there is a good use for it and is like a cycle. Now onto animals, this year they added pigs, which is a good way to make money but not the best as in my opinion I think that cows and sheep make you some decent money, so sheep aren't actually that hard to deal with, all you do is get a water tank, fill it up and then grow grass or just go anywhere where there is grass (not unowned fields) and start mowing, then under the loading wagons in the shop, get a forage wagon and pickup the dark greenish area and take the silage to the sheep area and you will start producing wool, another feature is how the let the sheep in like in real life which makes it very realistic. Moving on to cows which I wouldn't be surprised is a bit complicated but soon you should get the hang of it, anyways the game claims it is ""advanced farming"", so don't be worried, even if you played this game for years like me. There are also more features for me which adds a bit of a ""More than just being a farmer with no life"" experience to the game: you have houses and on Goldcrest Valley you have a Pickup parked in a parking area near this house, it would be cool if you had a bit more of a life apart from farming like a house. They also have a feature which allows you to clean dirty vehicles which is pretty interesting and fun, there is also gas/fuel, places to park your cars and different views and other small features like the gold coins on singleplayer which give you Bill Gates money and lots of other features.Cons:This is a very hard one but some of the physics in the game get questionable, but the ability to fly with a log is very questionable and also have your logs all out of the trailer and see a pickup fly in the air when it was on the ground.Overall this is the best Farming Simulation sort of game in the universe and if I rated this bad, I would have to rate all the other Farming Simulation games that compete as bad. Thanks for tuning into my review today! Peace Out!Overall Rating:10/10"

This builds on FS2015 in a good way - the interface and operations are familiar so you're straight at it if you played any of the recent iterations.Graphics are good and smooth on my upper-mid-range system, coping nicely at 1920x1080.There are some nice new options:  specifically, the ability to lease equipment which makes it MUCH easier to upgrade early on, and the ability to work on other farmers' fields (AI, if you're playing single player: I've not even looked at multiplayer yet) which, on easy mode, earns you stacks of money.  Even on hard mode, it's a useful boost - you can plant your own fields and then go off harvesting, seeding etc on other fields while they grow, so you're earning during what used to be wasted time waiting for the crops to grow.Sosnovka map returns unchanged which is also good - it's a good map, and if you've played it before you know where everything is, which helps.  The other map is also nice, just started in hard mode there.Also seems to me that the AI helper drivers are driving better.  They no longer stick to a fixed pattern and get stuck against a tree, as used to happen at the edges of fields sometimes.  With that said, I do have one mod which they make crazy wide turns - but that is likely an issue with the mod, possibly a bad collsion box.Overall then a good upgrade on 2015.  It's possible to convert mods from earlier versions, or just wait until someone else does - popular mods will already be out there for 2017; I found several of my favorites without difficulty."

Duh,  And it seems like in each verion of the game this maintenance cost seems to double. Up to $2000 a day main. cost for a decent combine. need i say more.As for the vehicles, the textures and animation are amazing. The custimization is great but....why go to all of this trouble if all of the custimization is the same, for all of the vehicles. The Wide , skinny, dual tripple tire & Wheels. The SAME!. On ALL THE TRACTORS! I'm sure Giants had to go through a lot to get the liscense for each major brand, Then stick identical tires & wheels on everything. And to make it worse they changed the engine sounds as well. Now you only hear the acelleration sounds. When the rpm levels out you hear nothing. WRONG! And they did it one every vehicle. And to add injury to insult, they brought back that annoying compressor clicking sound that was in the 2013 game. It's a sound loop that replays every 15 seconds. In EVERY VEHICLE!. It wasn't in the 2015 game. And speaking of 2013, they returned with that help icon that stops you in you tracks, forcing you to click on it. Why they put these irritating thing back in 2017 is beyond me.The one thing i think Giants got perfect was the new menu system with helper info. It informes you when your helper is finished a field, something blocking it's or stuck on something(awsome)  I mean the game is still good and highly reccomended, is just with all new versions some of the contents will be questionable and a lot of the kinks fixed with time."

76561197977540832,Recommended,447020,33299714,Posted: 5 July,all,Tantric,"I'm enjoying this game and will probably rack up at least 70-80 hours in it all told, but I have a few pro's and cons to go over as despite a big upgrade from the previous Farming Simulators, this isn't altogether a perfect game, although they did improve on a lot of the previous mechanics and expand on it.Pro's:+ The greatest draw to this game is the open world and freedom to do whatever you want.  You can either play the campaign for realism or free play to just drive around in cool vehicles right away, or personally, I enjoy spending time logging mixed with farming, which has been expanded and improved in this game.+ Tons more vehicles than the previous game, in virtually every aspect+ A slightly better AI system than previous+ Mod support including easy access to mods from a built in mod menu, including tons of free mods added from Giants software themselves.Con's:- The AI is still a bit wonky, I had cleared out all trees near the edges of my farm and expanded the borders of fields with plows, but then the AI would do weird things like not harvest or plant in certain areas or would get themselves stuck on rocks, etc.- No AI still for things like straw collectors/balers or tipper drivers.  The AI is still ""stupid"" and is unaware of other AI vehicles, meaning two AI vehicles meeting on the same path will get confused and get stuck requiring manual intervention.  This happens a lot say with cultivators and seeders, if they meet at the edges of the field when they try to turn, even if they're not overlapping each other.  AI vehicles also get confused if something is in their path, even if it would be easy to just go around or avoid it (like a trailer parked on the outside edge of a field that seems out of the way enough).- Money seems harder to make in this game than previous, and harvest missions almost seem like the fastest way to get money early on, and not develop your farm.  If all you want to do is just work on and develop your farm, they should have made it easier to start out imo.  This is especially problematic because you start out with old tractors that have really high repair costs and will drain your income.All in all I was hoping this game would expand on the AI aspect to really allow you to play more of a farm management role instead of a farmhand itself, and while the AI is slightly less stupid than previous and other comments have pointed it out, it still has a long way to go and still requires you to do quite a bit of the work.  It should be called more accurately as a ""Farm Vehicle Simulator"" than ""Farming Simulator,"" and had I known the AI was still fairly bad I wouldn't have picked up this title, and by the time I really figured it out I was past my 2 hour refund mark.All in all, I still gave it a recommendation.  What I wanted out of this game may be different than others, and I'm still enjoying it despite the limitations.  It's a game I'll sink 80+ hours into I'm sure before I move on to something else, but at the same time wish it was something more than what it is."

After that the game felt a lot more intuitive, I knew how to create produce, where to sell it and what to spend money on.Graphics are great, has that classical farming simulator feel to it and is very well optimised for performance. But by far my favourite thing is the satisfying animations that go along with ploughing land, harvesting wheat and transferring produce.Sadly you can't run over pedestrians or do too much damage to the town but I guess that’s to be expected since this isn't GTA. I did notice that driving into things sometimes does bug out your vehicle but that was more funny than annoying.Overall a great game, don't hesitate if you're new to farming sims.

,Not Recommended,447020,33642009,Posted: 18 July,all,Sandy Cat,"I only bought this game on sale after hearing that there wasn't much improvement from the previous title. Which I then learned was still to much to pay. I put in a bit of time on the previous games, so the lack of changes/improvements has really compounded the feeling that it is probably time move on from these games. If this is your first time with the series you might genuinely enjoy this game, especially with all the mods that exist. Baring in mind that this game is only a simulator by its own title (which means it's not really a simulator). If you have played either 2013 or 2015, then your just spending money on virtually the same product.Truth be told, you are probably better of just buying Farming Simulator 2015 on a super cheap sale as these two games are basically the same. And in terms of mods, there aren't many new essentials mods that I can think of that aren't just ports from the 2015 game. In fact, most of the new features in this game are just mods from 2015 that became official mechanics.The one change I did enjoy about this game is that hard mode is actually hard. The down side to that is that the game makes me feel like I am wasting my time when playing on this setting. The difficulty setting only serves to ask you one basic question. Do you want to spend one week grinding out for better equipment or one month?Another thing that adds to feeling that your wasting your time on the hard difficulty is the new ability to work for the AI farmers. While a worth while addition in its own right, the problem stems from the amount you get paid working for the AI. The payout is way to much and doesn't scale at all with the difficulty. This causes a scenario to occur where you don’t want to work on your own fields for pennies in profits, while you also don’t want to buy any of the other fields because you will lose out on the amazing profit opportunities working for the AI. Add in the new mechanic where your equipments costs more to maintain the longer you use it/own it and you really have to ask yourself if buying any equipment is even worth it. Why build your own farm when you could just work for these multi-billionaire farmers who lend you their super awesome equipment and who pay you as much as they pay their accountant who maintains their off-shore panama accounts.The question you might find yourself asking is, if you don't enjoy the harder hard difficulty, why do you play on it? I bring this up because the hard setting isn't one that adds any new creative challenge to the game. It doesn't force you to play much smarter, it only serves to drag out the existing things you do. Which is a problem in a game that is too easy on the normal and easy setting.I will add that my favorite moment with this game was when I reinstalled course play, automated all my tasks, and stood back and watched as the AI did all the work. Which then made me feel real sad because it felt to close to what is currently happening in real life. I was role playing the demise of the lower and middle class as I automated and removed jobs that would never return to my saves virtual economy.TL;DR. Just buy Farming Sim 2015."

Plough, cultivate, sow, fertilise, fertilise, fertilise again, harvest, take to market, and sell for a good price. You can also get into the realm of forrestry, which is not too profitable but fun nonetheless, or animal husbandry, which involves lots of watering, feeding, and cleaning around the trays. There are also a massive number of farming machines and equipment available for purchase, from dinky little tractors to massive combine harvesters.This game has several fun updates since Farming Simulator 16, but be warned that it might not be worth the purchase if you are strapped for cash and/or already have an older version. It's certainly not the sort of game from which you can expect lots of action; it's a slow, relaxing game about running a farm.All together, I give this game eight bags of fertiliser out of ten."

I have had every farming simulator game since giants software started making the farm simulator franchise and I got to say the graphics are beautiful and better on 17 compared to 15 in my opinion even though the game is basically running the same graphics engine as 15. All the tractors are awesome especially the ones you get with the pre-order.

The worker system has been improved dramaticaly and will no longer overlap by more than a foot at most even with towed sowers and sprayers. Almost all of the DLC from fs15 has been released as a mod by GIANTS themselves. There are way more vehicles and types of vehicles to try out plus all of the old vehicles. The modding system is awesome in the sense that you don't have to exit the game or open a browser or anything to install a mod. It runs really well and the graphics have been improved significantly. The attention to detail is phenomenal and even includes a fully functional radio with live broadcasting.Even if you aren't a fan of farming simulators, there is so much to do, that you have to try it no matter what type of game you like.

I've seen the improvements made in leaps and bounds with all of the PC releases.  Each title is a nice jump forward from the last and FS17 definitely does not disappoint!This game is more than just are-skinof FS15.  We have multiple avenues to deliver goods to market now, we finally have new crops and livestock, we have a new livestock management system, we have radio stations(including live online streaming), an improved AI, improved crop/field/soil management system, greater vehicle handling(you no longer feel like you are driving on ice all the time), and so much more!  From a modding standpoint it also appears that Giants have cleaned up the code a little as well and made things a little easier to read and understand.  Let's not forget that the game is absolutely beautiful too!Hands down, Giants Software remains the king of the hill on farming simulation games in my opinion!Buy this, you won't be disappointed."

,Not Recommended,447020,29417753,Posted: 22 January,all,Lorgarn,"Farming Simulator 17 (FS 15 v1.2)This release in, in my honest opinion, doesn't warrant being its own title. This should've been an expansion, perhaps an DLC to Farming Simulator 15. Ridden with the same performance issues, bugs and general odd behavior out of a supposed 2016 release, FS17 doesn't bring a whole lot new stuff to the table. They're essentially charging you full for a re-packaged FS15 with a few news maps, some vehicles, minor features, etc.Many of these things isn't really something this game is in dire need of, it doesn't need more vehicles, new animals or ""trains"". What this game needs is an overhaul of the entire engine, they need to rework or completely move away from their current engine. What kind of multiplayer game needs everyone on an server to stop for five seconds to synchronize with eachother when a new player loads in?Physics, the physics in this game is beyond horrible. So many times had I spent a full 10 minutes on loading logs, only to have the last one flip out on me and throw me and my once fully loaded wagon away. I was hoping this would be fixed, as FS15 pretty much had the same issues.For Farming Simulator I've coined the term 'Styrofoam Logs (feat. Dipped in Vaseline)', which is something this game suffers severely from. The log physics in this game is horrible, they have little to no weight in them, no grip or staying power which means that they glide and slide around like they're dipped in vaseline. So many times have I had the claw on the wheel loader, filled beautifully with logs, only to have them slowly but surely slide out of the claw on me. Even when I'm standing completely still, they'll just slide out and drop on the ground. I've noticed this styrofoam nature is a problem with most of the game assets and I suspect the problem roots from the subpar and outdated engine they use for this game.FS17, and 15 before it, does a few things great - Farming, actually not that surprising I guess. Farming in FS works great, with few hiccups on pretty much every step of the way. The worker A.I is a bit wonky but it can be dealt with.Graphics - Hello, what happened? This release has pretty much the exact same graphics and overall assets as FS15. Utterly disappointing and reinforces my earlier statement about this should've been an expansion or DLC to FS15 and the last major game title to be using this outdated game-engine. Not befitting a 2016 release, AT ALL. Especially considering the popularity of this title.I will not recommend this game to anyone and this could very much end up being the last FS game that I buy from GIANTS Software."

(Personal I just do it myself to get more time in the game)-Controls on keyboard are quite nice to use and good to learn.-U have 2 trains, and I like that u can ride some trains as well-Selling a amount of liters of your farm to get money to get new and more mordern machines-Good economy system (Keep in mind u won't get the same amount of money in real life)-This game CAN be playable for more than 200+ hours or longerSome control tips they don't give to you in-game-Press 9 To scale your minimap or to hide it-F1 to hide the controls menu (top left)-7 to slow the real time speed-8 to raise the real time speed-5 To enable the radio-4 to go to the previous radio station-6 to go the next radio station"

76561198028713617,Recommended,447020,27955368,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Nuke The Whales,"First of all I would like to say that I was maliciously forced into writing this review by Steam, in order to get the Autumn Sale Steam Badge 2016 (just making my parents proud). So if you've got any complaints, blame Valve!Well FS 17 is obviously about farming if you haven't sussed it out so far! Modern farming. Modern farming with modern farming machines getting bigger and bigger as you progress. Yee-Haw!But it's not simply about driving up and down your fields in a tractor. It's a solid management game (mainly money): Should I buy a bigger plough (or plow if you like), sower or harvester? The plough might simply catch up with the harvester, making it unnecessary. Or should it be a 2nd harvester or another field? Should I take up a bigger loan in order to get both? Or should I simply pay off my loan first? Etc...As time progresses you'll have more and more to take care of. It won't only be the work on the fields, checking the market for prices and handling you're braindead workers, but you might also be taking care of your animals (chicken, pigs, sheep and cows), driving X from A to B, doing the odd forestry, picking up hay bales you previously ran over, making plans on where to place your next investment, or simply sitting in a tractor with a worker inside and watch him do his work „Because I can afford it now“. Once you get the hand of the game, it quite self-explanatory.It's slow paced, grindy, zen-like gameplay. So don't expect to be owning the best equipment within the first few hours of the game. Great often afk / halfway playing game: While playing you can easily listen to music (in-game radio is available), watch any series or sports, ignore your sister on Skype because you're trying to drive perfect lines, or simply think about stuff like the history of dog food.I have most of my hours in MP: It's just so relaxing to drive up and down the fields with your co-farmers, honk every time you cross one another and pick up the odd machine fight because that same careless idiot touched you once again.Easy time management in SP or with admin rights on a dedicated server (real time  - 120x). Servers are fairly cheap compared to other games.There are two available maps at the moment. An American (according to the many stars and stripes) and a Russian (I only assume it's Russian, you know, Cyrillic stuff).You've got a fair amount of official mods to choose from within the good in-game mod menu. Sadly they do not update automatically. It also would be handy if one could automatically download any needed mod once logging on to a new server.Something I really miss is seasons. Snow, hail and rain do exist, but there are no real seasons with different crops to grow or any other preparations to take care of.Obviously I can't recommend this game to everybody. The first time I came across this franchise I shook my head in disbelief asking myself “What kind of freaks play this game?” Little did I know I would become such a freak. But that's it: you have to be the player who likes relaxing games with slow progress. Who knows? There might just be that little farmer hiding somewhere within you (you'll find it out soon enough, otherwise Steam refund policy).You might just end up having a blast of a time in the economic branch which is the backbone of our civilization. The surplus of food over thousands of years combined with the many inventions leading to the very fact that you are now sitting on your lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ staring at your screen and just wasted a few minutes of your precious life reading my lousy review about a farming simulator instead of roaming the fields and woods in search for edible roots and berries.Thanks for the Autumn Sale Steam Badge 2016!P.S Nuke the whales"

It has a robust and healthy mod community adding new content and maps, so that is nice. The downside is that this is a straight forward simulation with absolutely no story line. Some people prefer this in their simulations, and I get that. Me personally, I like just a hint of arcade. The truth is that no matter how well made this game is, it quickly becomes monotonous and predictable.I played some of the multiplayer map, but even that was nothing special.  It is a good game, and has a lot of positives, but for me lacks heart, and is far too clinical feeling. If you want a straight up no nonsense or frills farming simulator, this hits the mark."

I can tell you honestly after 6 hours playing 17 the improvements are well worth it. The minute you load the game and start playing you can tell how different things are. Many of the script mods are now part of the game. Most of my favorite tractor mods are part of the game. I find that when Giants make a tractor it is generally more polished. The field textures are better than any of the modded textures I've found so far. The improvements to the feel of driving equipment are great. One aspect of the game that really shocked me is the improvements in sound. They have also managed to improve the quality and performance of the graphics at the same time. The game performs flawlessly with all graphics settings on max at 4k resolution with every nvidia option set to highest quality. The level of configurability is another great feature of this new version. I can honestly say it feels like a completely new game and as someone who really liked 15 with all the improvements in 17 I will probably not be able to play 15 anymore.If you like 15 but this game.

,Recommended,447020,27763914,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,WillSassoLemon,"I always find it difficult to explain the appeal of Farming Simulator. It’s certainly a marmite genre; you either love it or you hate it. The game is pretty much what is says on a tin. You own and expand your farm, buying more fields and new equipment to use, diversifying into whatever branch of farming you wish, whether it’s crops, livestock or forestry.While Farming Sim veterans will be able to dive straight into the career mode, there are a set of simple tutorials for those new to the series. These teach you all the basics; from ploughing to harvesting, and give an introduction to the more intense aspects such as looking after animals, or the machinery required for forestry. FS 17 has also introduced a handy Help section to the pause menu, allowing you to quickly read up on a processes, or a little recap on the difference needs of different animals.Even after playing the last three installments, I still get confused between hay and straw, and the actions required to produce them, so the little guide is the perfect way to refresh my memory.Growing any sort of crop has a long list of tasks to undertake along the way. Occasionally ploughing your field is now required to get the maximum yield, before you get to cultivating it and seeding. Your choices here include wheat, barley, canola, corn, potatoes and sugar beets. Sunflowers, soybeans and oilseed radishes have also been added to the game, expanding the list of crops that you can grow. You then need to fertilise, whether through the use of fertiliser spreaders, sprayers or alternatively using a presumably foul smelling slurry produced from your cows. Depending on the difficulty, you might need to fertilise three times during different stages of crop growth. Once fully grown, you’re finally able to break out the combine harvester with a suitable header – or a forage harvester, depending on the crop – and harvest you produce, before storing it or taking it to sell at the several stations around the map. Drivable trains are a new addition that can be used for transporting large amounts of your crop around the map.Each selling point offers different prices that react to supply and demand, pushing you to grow a wide selection of crops to maximise your profits. With those profits, you can then upgrade your equipment to whatever you chose. Perhaps a more powerful tractor is your heart’s desire, a wider cultivator, or a bigger harvester. The choice is entirely yours to how to manage your farm, and as with previous games, you can always hire helpers to do a lot of the busy work for you.Alongside the chickens, sheep and cows from before, pigs have been added to the game. Animals have always been considered ‘late game’ as they are expensive and difficult to maintain, although provide the greatest profit. The difficulty comes from the equipment required, cows are especially expensive, due to their complicated dietary requirements, but on the flip side, once you have established your heard, their milk is sold and you can also use their slurry and manure to fertilise your fields, saving you money. Although not as intensive as cows, pigs also require a mixture of foods. Maximising their productivity will enable them to reproduce, after which you can sell them and all other animals too.The other alternative to crops or livestock is forestry. Introduced in FS15, not much here has changed outside of the addition of poplars. These can be planted in your fields and harvested by a forage harvester, after which the woodchips can then be sold and converted into energy at the biogas plant. There are a few more machines to try out though, which slightly lowers the entry level for serious mechanised forestry.For me, one of the best additions to the game is the new mission system. In previous games, the other fields around the map that you didn’t own remained static, but you now see them being used for growing crops. You can help out your fellow farmers by completing tasks for them, earning you a bit of cash on the side. This also results in a much greater variety of missions on offer, from ploughing to harvesting. In the early stages of the game, it’s also a great way to be able to use higher end equipment that you know is many hours of game time away.Should you want to get a piece of the more advanced equipment even sooner, you can always lease equipment from the shop. After paying an initial fee, you pay for each operating hour and day you have that equipment leased out. It certainly makes the game more accessible than before, although PC players have previously enjoyed this feature through a popular mod.Speaking of mods, FS 17 is the first time that mods will be available on console. There is a thriving modding community on PC, adding more vehicles, maps and new features  to the game. Although we don’t yet know which mods will be allowed on consoles and the limits on what they’ll be able to do, it’s certainly a welcomed addition to the game.I’ve noticed some small graphical improvements on PC, although many of the models remain the same. The interiors for example, still feel slightly lacklustre as only certain elements of the dashboards work, and on-board computer screens are mostly static. The lighting system has been improved, with rotating beacons now reflecting off of other objects for example, and some of the ground textures now look sharper, although soil deformation is still a dream away.Although I’ve been unable to try it, the multiplayer is also said to have been improved. Console players can invite up to five friends to join them, while on PC the limit is sixteen. If you can find a group of friends to join you, you can make quick work of working on your fields, while having some relaxing fun at the same time.What’s Good:Wide variety of things to do and equipment to useNew mission system is implemented wellEasier to access late-game equipmentLots of options to tailor the experience to your tastesWhat’s Bad:Not a huge step forward from FS 15Interior models are still poorWith over 250 vehicles and equipment, Farming Sim 17 is bigger and better than ever. Although it’s still not going to be a game for everybody, this edition is more accessible and complete than ever before. Gamers that have no interest in slow-paced repetitive gameplay will likely be disappointed, but for those that enjoyed the previous games will find that there’s just about enough new features to justify a purchase.Score: 7/10"

Fs17 contains a large amount of graphical and physics based improvements, this allows the game to be more realistic than ever which is what people 'should' want in a simulator game. Now it is also understandable that gameplay features are also important but the majority of players of Fs15 believe in quantity over quality when it comes to game based additions. They prefer 'shallow', un-stereotypical  forms of making money such poplars, bales and extra animal management.Like i said, Fs17 is a great game and i strongly recommend that (if you're into simulators) you should purchase this game."

The standard game is very refined and runs smoothly however some aspects are lacking and not so realistic. However the expnasive avaliability of mods not only in the game's intergrated modhub but also other mod sites allow you to expand your amount of tractors and equipment avalliable extends the game that much further. With the amount of entusiasm from the modding community means the FS17 is becoming more and more realistic as time goes on. I would reccomend this game to any simulation fan and would encourage anyone who does not necassarily play these types of games to give the game a go.

But after only 1,5 hours in game I can safely say its staying. Yes its just like 15, with more stuff, but 15 was 13 with more stuff, 13 was 11 with more stuff.But this isn't just more stuff, first thing I was impressed by was the new mod menu, in the game main menu, select, download, delete, manage your mods in game, better than before. Then when you start a game you can select which you want.Once in game, you look at the map, new icons, new crop, new settings, select how many times you need to fertilize to get full yield, 30% per fertilization, then extra 10% if you plow the field first. Also you now have to plow Fields! yes there is  a use for it other than making your fields bigger!Then i checked the shop. What a vanilla selection, i wont be touching mods for a while for once. A placeable wood chipper! extra sheds etc, all vanillaThen when you have workers doing the dirty stuff and your bored, take a chainsaw, cut down a tree, cut it up and PICK UP THE PIECES by hand and fill your pick up, drive to the sawmill and get££££. For me this made my day lol actually being able to pick up the tiny bits of wood that annoyed me so much in 15, throw them into my truck and sell em.The maps are beautiful and feel alive, you feel immersed.Then I found missions........ I havent done mission in FS since I played it on my old Samsung S4. I just spent an hour doing missions as now you get real jobs, not just go here, go there. You have to plow, seed, harvest other farmers fields to increase your standing with them, which lowers the cost of buying their fields.For me this is the best one yet. It is staying in my libraryUPDATE REVIEWHaving now played more I can say that the trains are a great addition, however an extra area to load wood wouldve been nice. The second map im not 100% on yet, but will update this review when I've played it more.Also need ot add that so far Giants have added more free content via the mods menu, including the ItRunner pack"

I play with an XB1 controller and the controller support in terms of sensitivity is GARBAGE: Turning more than 1mm on a thumbstick is enough to send you spinning out of control at anything above 15mph, you cannot lower the sensitivity in the game, you can only make it higher which is beyond insane but it actually gets worse, you can modify the input config to lower the sensitivity.. problem solved right? No! Lowering the sensitive actually lowers the % that the wheels turn so it's just as sensitive but you cannot fully turn any longer! Absolute ******* madness!2. Online is even worse, forget the fact you need friends with a passworded server (pretty much every public one has had some **** drive all the vehicles in to water) but point 1 I mention is even worse online and controlling your machine with a controller becomes 10 times more difficult than playing alone, it is such a disappointment. Also ""synchronising with other players"" depending on how♥♥♥♥♥♥their pc/connection is can be regular pauses for 15 secs to 3 minutes where you cannot play."

It's almost the same, same cheesy bugs when carrying logs, same tyres that looks like they got 250 psi of pressure in them, same textures (with slight improvement), same horrible driving feeling, same physics (exept the trees wich seems to not fall when you cut them and oblige you to ram them with your tractor). in my first hour or so of playing i encountered 6 bugs (three of them were my tractor being catapulted 50 feets foward when hitting a lamp post). I did cheat money in to take a look at the 3 wheeled monster and the other awesome looking tractors and peices of equipment and was quite dissapointed when i took them for a drive. I understand this is not a driving simulator but come on ! The ""biggest"" new feature is the added trains wich i don't find so useful since you have to drive to them, put whatever your logs (and other things) in them, move to the train switching station, take the big crane, switch the logs on the other train, get to the sawmill, and drop them in your truck to transfer them to the sawmill... what's the point ? I do like the added feature of customisation (color, engines and wheels setup) but there's a slight problem with it : no preview screen. you can't see what your tractor will look like before buying it (and it cost the base 1000 plus the price of the addon if you don't like how it looks). Now this is a first look review, it's not detailed but it can give you an idea of what changed. Conclusion : i don't quite see the difference between this and Fs15, but don't get me wrong, it's still an awesome game ! just think twice before buying it if you already own Fs15."

There are some major improvements, the first being able to pick things up by hand is a huge step forward. Also in Hard Mode it is much more realistic with having to fertlize more than once as well as plow. So far I do love the additions to the Farming Simulator family.However, as I stated before there are still so many bugs. It almost seems like the game should have had a longer beta test with release not till the end of november, possibly christmas. Many of the norms frm FS15 have been lost and need to be re-added to this game. Which should not be the case.It is still a good game, but I would suggest waiting for a few more patches to come out before buying this product. If you loved FS 15 you will be annoyed with state in which FS17 is at this moment."

Im really enjoying the new aspects of the game. the three stage fertilization of your crops is a nice touch, and to be honest, something i would of liked in the previous game. Not only do you start the game with three fields and basic equipment, but you also have the chance to do the stuff for other in game farmers to earn money and make sort of friendships with these charactors. You can undertake tasks such as fertilizing, or harvesting these charactors fields and in return you get money. these tasks are time based and you also get time bonus money for completing the tasks within the alotted time. eventually through farming you own land and that of other charactors you make money to buy or upgrade your vehicles. Also as in the previous games you can buy extra fields, only now, the more work you don on that field the lower it will cost you to buy it. Ive only just started owning animals in the game but from what i have found it is very easy and a slick interface of what is required helps you to understand the needs and output of your animals. You can own sheep,cows and pigs and all have their own requirements for feeding. some of the veicles can be modified, though i have found them to mostly be tractors, where, depending on the vehicle depends on the upgrade availabe as not all upgrades are available on every tractor so pick wisely :-) Over all this game is plenty of fun to play, but i do have one very serious warning. you WILL loose huge chunks of your real life, fulfilling your role as a virtual farmer :-)"

With so many options of how you want to farm from hiring helpers to doing all the work yourself or with friends in multiplayer, the game remains fresh and new each playthrough. I stream this game in multiplayer with viewers joining me in the game and we have had a great time. I highly recommed this game for you Steam library. If you don't think you like simulation games, this is one to take a closer look at for sure. Cultivate, firtilize, plant then speed up time to harvest or..... Grab a tractor of any other vehicle and see who jump of the highest cliff. How many time can I flip this tractor I wonder? Want to go flying into the air off a cliff in a simi? Yes, you can do all of this! If you get board in this game, you just need to explore more. Great game + Great community = Great fun.

Graphics and animations of harvesters. tractors and tools are fine with little to none glitches, just an occasional stuttering depending on the map and viewing direction. Sounds are ok, for the tractors as well as environment and tools.Controlling certain tools can be tricky; unfortunately the game does not support multiple input devices like steering wheel and joystick properly (or at all; at least here Thrustmaster wheel and Flightstick would not work).If you plan to do every task on your own or in a multiplayer setup, then that's the farming game to go.If you plan to rely on the hired hands to manage a couple of fields then abandon all hopes, as the helper AI is abysmal (to put it mildly). There is not a single error the computer-controlled helpers would not make. They abandon jobs, drive away from the field, wrap themselves around trees, stop a job for no reason, turn around willy nilly ... think of an error, they'll do it; on all fields.Big plus: the giant-engine is solid and I didn't have any issues with the game, even though I'm exploiting the habit of tabbing in and out of a game often.Summary: if you can live with the worst helper AI since Daikatana ... go for it.

Plus, they have included a mod menu which allows you to download mod's and install the them with one click.A good feature is the fact you can work for other farmers on their fields and the more you do the more they like you which is great as the price of fields you don’t own is lowered, which is better when it comes to buying new fields. You get paid good money too and in most cases I have also received good money for time bonus. FYI it’s a good choice to do these early on as you get you use the better equipment and it’s all most like a test drive apart from you’re not just driving your using the equipment how you would on your farm.The only downsides is the mouse movement is a little slow when gaming in 4K and one of the early plow’s is a little buggy on certain fields.

I had no idea that farming could be so cool, not to mention the ability to do so many different jobs all at the same time. I love it, and 40 hours in a few short days shows, I have a serious problem.Only a few things about this game need improvement (nothing game breaking or warranting any less of a great score.)1. I wish the workers you hire could be just a bit more competent, they have trouble navigating any field that isn't perfectly square on all sides, which makes things very frustrating when you have 31 fields to tend to.2. Something needs to be said about the fact that we cannot remove the small trees  and bushes that are all over in many maps. you would imagine a mower as gigantic as we have access to, would be able to eat these shrubs and foilage.3. Hopefully in the next version we have the ability to plant things like orchards and vineyards, maybe in essence a better end game goal. Also, little features like a GPS line to help keep your machine on track in a straight line according to the field you are tending to.Either way, this game is a massive time killer and a great distraction while I wait for Star Citizen 3.0 to launch.9/10 would farm again.

Even after 20 hours of play I can't get used to whatever the hell is going on with the steering system. I can't even drive along a straight road without losing control, yet on another game can land a helicopter with pixel precision, so it can't be me, yet this game somehow has 88% positive I have no idea how. Constant over steering, constantly crashing into things. Tractor steering is terrible, car driving is completely unplayable. I wonder if all the developers play with steering wheels and didn't even bother to play like the average player that steers with WASD because I can't think of any other explanation as to why you'd release a game where you spend 95% of your time driving and not even make a decent driving system. I don't even remember it being this bad on the last FS I played which was 2013.A game with extremely complex controls yet you can't edit or even view the control list without having to disconnect from your game. This is probably the only game I've ever played that won't let you edit controls while playing, even 20 year old games let you do this... When you save your settings or disconnect from a game, the game restarts itself, this may only takes a few seconds but it's some seriously dodgy coding, no other game I've played does that.When driving you can switch between first person and third person yet on foot you can only be first person which doesn't make sense because it's not like this is a first person shooter and what's with being forced to have a crosshair when you don't have any weapons to aim...They haven't even fixed the random super lag in multiplayer that was in 2013. Super lag is about once every hour for 30 seconds, if driving, your vehicle will warp every second and the speedometer goes crazy, once it lagged so bad the speedometer jumped to 300 kph. Farming simulator is the only game that has this weird kind of super lag.When entering a vehicle it takes 3 seconds for it to actually start moving, why have a realistic feature like that which wastes time but have such an unrealistic feature that saves time where you can instantly teleport between vehicles with a key press?When playing multiplayer it doesn't even sync field state without going near it, so in the distance you might see a field ready to harvest and it shows on the map too as ready to harvest then you go near it and pieces start showing as harvested on screen and on the map."

But whilst there are some good aspects, there are some fundamental flaws:Pros. (over and above FS15)- The physics model is much better in 17. Logs now don't bounce around, heavy machinery such as combine headers have an impact on how the poise and balance of the combine / tractor.- The change to how the animals work is overall well done. No longer can they be fed to their max and then left for 6 days - now they need some tlc every so often.- The additional fertilisation stages and requirement to plough are welcome, though soil mod still does it better.- Including the new brands (MF, Fendt etc) are welcome, though some of the community mods in FS15 were just as good if not better (see BulletBill's MF mods)Cons.- The implementation of the mission system for me kills the game. At a stroke they've taken away the farming of crops and animal husbandry as the main money earner and in its place introduced a mini-game that is almost arcade in nature. Of course one can always ignore it, but given that this was going to be one of the major features, it is very dissapointing.- The mission system rewards bear almost no relation to the £ yiled value from each field. To put it simply, one can earn more from a single harvesting mission what the yield value would be for the field if it were player owned. This is a major oversight on Giant's part and needs to be addressed.- The map itself needs more care and attention. The sheep & cows should be planed at the farm whilst the farm itself should resemble what real life farms tend to look like in the NW USA / Canada. The mod map ""Manchester"" is the reference that Giants should have followed. Also the fields themselves are just too small in total for the size of the map - too much of the map is given over to what is effectively just scenery.My recommendation would be to wait for a few months until decent modded maps appear."

I would of posted this on the dlc page but i don't intend on buying it for that amount so can't comment there.I'm getting sick of dlc being priced like this, in the past dlc use to mean a whole new area, quests, new items etc etc at that price. now we just get a few items that adds nothing new for almost half the price of the game. i don't think so."

Its like they threw it together in a few months . Simple things like the becons and flashes show through trailer bodys to silage bunkers not working properly . A very long list of issue I don't see being fixed for months, if all even get fixed .As far as the game, Giants did add some new features . It just that most are from FS15 and previous mods by the comunity . It does have a lot of equitment in it, but again most is from a previous FS game converted to FS17 .Gameplay at first seems to have changed a little with a built in soil mod, pigs and a few new crops . Most of all came from comunity made mods .Thay have improved the log physics some and added a tweak to the graphics .The new map Goldcrest is not a true American map .

Highly recommend.Pros:Beautiful map with too many details to mention.Amazing detailed equipment that you can operate yourself or hire out to workers.  The imagery and audio for the equipment is amazing high quality.Many activities and equipment available to tend to your fields.Animals are very well done and tending to them can be very rewarding.Full economy to support your harvesting and animal husbandry activities.In addition to playing with all the different equipment you have to manage your finances and build a profitable business.Many customizable options to suit your preferences. From very easy to very challenging.New music tracks (simulated radio stations) to listen to while you drive.New pigs to raise and sell.New trailers to haul animals.New contracting jobs to earn money working other farmers fields.  Also a great way to try out different equipment.  Very well implemented in game.New types of crops to grow.New ways to fertilize, weed and improve crop yields.Many information screens providing status information on all your activities.  Animal status page is much improved.  Status of fields is much improved.Trains that you can load, drive and unload.  A beautiful addition.Profit for silage greatly reduced. Hurrah.  No longer better than raising crops.Tip anywhere!  Unload your trailers in storage shelters or anywhere you want and pick it up later with conveyer belts or loaders.Customize your vehicles with different colors, tires, engines, attachments, etc.Lease equipment instead of buying it.  Great for short term use or try it before you buy it.Large modding community providing all kinds of mods for free.  Mods are very easy to install and there is a built in management screen to view and enable or disable mods.Cons:Silage bunkers: handling of chaff and silage in bunkers is much worse and frustrating to deal with to get ingredients for cow feed.Only one new map so far.  Hopefully there are more planned for the future.Radio stations are repeating play lists of the same songs. very repetittive.Other:There are gold nuggets to collect for a reward of $1,000,000.  It is optional.Forestry income is lower but the equipment costs are very high.  It's not a way to get easy money.Some bugs have been reported that haven't been fixed yet.I strongly recommend this game if you enjoy simulations."

Gordon,"Played a couple of hours on another account, so don't judge this review by the time I've played it.Farming Simulator 17 is a leap forward from 15. There was no need for an intermedary FS 2016 release, and it shows.FS 15 is a good game, FS 17 is an excellent one.Here's a few excellent additions:- Finally GIANTS has decided to add TrackIR support to FS, which was a must for this game really. Too bad they didn't extend it to VR like ETS2 did, maybe in FS 2019. Still, driving the tractor with TIR5 on a 23 inch lcd monitor is bliss.I wanted to try to load FS17 up on the HTC VIVE using VorpX today as well and in conjuction with TRACKIR5 on the virtual widescreen cinema display in VorpX with the field of view set to 140, it is very close to VR.For those who want to try this, you will need to change the field of view setting (<fovy>60</fovy>) to 140 or 120 in the gameSettings.xml file which is located as usual for windows in the Documents/Mygames/FarmingSimulator2017.Then when the game loads in the HMD press the middle mouse button once, in order to see it on a big curved virtual cinema screen.- Some excellent mod ideas made it into FS 17 from FS 15 like the soilmod, and GIANTS gave us all a whole bunch of free DLC as  a cherry on top of this already impressive proverbial cake. Be sure to check them all out via the mods download screen ingame.- An ingame comprehensive HELP wiki, that will give all of you city folk and suburbians a crash course in farming, use of machinery, implements etc... No need for a PDF manual, everything you need to know (after you figure out the keys) is there ingame.- The soil is now a dynamic entity, and your tractors' wheels will sink into them depending on their wetness... Awesome !- I bought the HOLMER addon for FS 2015 basically to be able to drive the Terra Variant 600 eco. Sadly it is not (yet) included and I can only hope that GIANTS converts this excellent addon to FS 2017, and adds it as a free or payware DLC to this game, with maybe a reduction voucher for those who own the 2015 edition. Pretty Please ?To the devs I have this to say: My hat off to you!To those of you who are still not convinced that this is a corker of a game, and crave yet more immmersion, I have an excellent tip:Pretend your bath or shower is broken for the next 5 days and refuse to use it, for the full monty experience don't change underwear for that period neither. On day number five, put on your VIVE and launch this game... The view and the smell should give you a 10/10 in immersion.Enjoy !"

Nothing wrong with that since I am as present male and I use this feature;+ Place ables have been greatly improved and more options added, e.g. sheds, water towers, bee hives, green houses, wind farms, etc.Lots more to come...CONS:– When the game was first released to the public trees kept disappearing into the gound and couldn't be retrieved by the player;– Graphics have lots of similarities to Farming Simulator 15 (FS15 and FS17 use the same game engine, but graphics are in much high detail);– The game will sometimes turn totaly black with only brand names showing in white meaning a game restart is required;– The game will sometimes have similar issues as above but grey all over and again a restart is required;– £30 for the amount of bugs given on release doesn't make me feel like it was worth it. If the bugs weren't so bad then £30 would be understandable and it's obvious that Giants Software have rushed it near the end.Conclusion:Apart from the fact it has so many bugs then this is a great game for anybody who want to experience being a farmer or just wants to learn how to become one. 4.5 Stars (5 Stars when the major bugs are fixed if ever). :D"

If i had to describe the feeling of playing this game in one word it would be like getting a happy ending handy from an asian massuese in a shady spa upstairs from a starbucks and she gives you a blow job for no extra tip but like 3 weeks later you get oozing sores on your thinga-ma-bob and you realize the mistake you made. Also the pickup truck in this game is really fast but the tractors are slow.

,Recommended,447020,26550629,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,Leaf,"Overall, I would recommend this as there is such an improvement over the '15 version. I definitely never enjoyed the other versions as much as this one.HOWEVER, for a game that is supposed to be full release, I am encountering a HUGE number of bugs. Not gamebreaking ones, but very irritating ones. I'm having problems with lighting randomly flashing at night and the screen doing random things when I'm near the shop or in town. After the update that occured today, I am STILL encountering these bugs PLUS some more. I now get a pop-up every so often telling me to purchase the full game (Which I have), and it also took me 20mins to start up after the update after some really random lag which caused me to have to restart the game numerous times. I am pretty disappointed with this as they are the sorts of bugs that you would expect an early access game to have.At the moment, other than the bug telling me to buy the game, I can manage, but if these sorts of things really really irritate you (as in more than they are surrently irritating me, which is a fair amount) then I would suggest waiting a while for the development team to actually implement some fixes."

I think it is due to the few (far away) servers.Gameplay is in multiplayer mode very shockery, ful of lag, andsometimes so jumpy that steering is impossible because of ending up in the woods or ditches.Even with the most advanced computers and high velocity processors!Why not the option for LAN (without the only few badly working servers).The most groupplayers are mostly a bunch of friends/family,sitting in the neighbourhood of each other on a local network.Even on local network the multiplayer option works like in telephonemodem games in the late 90's.So on a distance of a few 100kms playing with others is hopeless and results in ""stop playing the game""."

This is a well put together and solid game in a solid engine. I maybe would've liked some new features but the mod community for this game is solid as well and will fill in things you may have wanted reasonably fast. Playing the game is a variety of fairly simple tasks but it is perfect to come home to after a long day and relax with your tractor and your pigs. A few things will need rebalancing like they did in 2015 but I have faith that even if the developer is slow with balance patches the mod community will pick up the slack. If you enjoyed 15 this is more of the same but with a few additional crops and some interesting functionality that is not well introduced but once you come across it will add a lot to your gameplay."

Visually, the game has dramatically improved.  New equipment is interesting and welcomed.  But, Goldcrest Valley and Sosnovka maps are not as interesting or visually appealing as Bjornholm and Westbridge Hills.  (This is especially true for Goldcrest Valley.)  The new interface is attractive and makes it easier to check grain prices, and provides lots of player help/suggestions, but some actions seem more tedious, i.e. relocating equipment, buying animals, finding/loading fertilizer and seeds, etc.The modders will hopefully correct some of these shortcomings and give us some better maps along the way.

It really should be called ""The plowing and selling game"" with small things to do on the side.(logging, biogas, livestock)this is not a true simulator,,,just a rough sketch of a simulator with some tractor Porn as bait. the elements are there but just shadows of what could be.still, if you are severly autistic,  german, or simply a completion freak there is some value.I wanted a good farm simulator and did not get one."

Spent over two hours taking them and thus can no longer refund the game without putting in a request- Honest I bought it for chicken farming but the mechanic is so shallow I don't know why it's even there- in fact, there isn't a lot of control of your farm- no ability to specialize your farm except maybe in crops- Why do the chickens lay their eggs in the grass?? It'd be easier to see and collect in the coop where healthy hens normally lay eggs- You start the game with a bunch of assets already so good luck figuring out what's all yours and how ot video game them- The super dramatic intro is a plus, got a chuckle- I had fun driving my tractors up cliffs like a maniac- That was very serious the cliff-driving was hilarious"

I had real issues to even go straight with it, not to mention to properly cultivate the field in straight lines, While I completed the job on time I felt like ""I wouldnt pay for job done like this myself""."

I have over 350 hours on Farming Simulator 15, and I gave this one a try since waiting for its release.The graphics, despite what the marketing videos show, are a step down.  It looks like the devs went from pen and ink '15 version to a crayon overlay in '17.  It is so difficult to line up the cultivator or sower because it is nearly impossible to identify where you have already worked your field.  The edges of the tractors and the surrounding terrain are just not crisp and really not pleasing to look at as compared to Farming Simulator 15.It does appear that the devs added in a lot more options for missions (which are not available in multiplayer), and you have to travel to each field to view the mission instead of a bulletin board.  There are also more locations to sell goods and new crops to choose from.  There are also trains, which only appear to travel in circles (and can really put a wallop on any tractors you accidentally left on the tracks).  There are new sound effects of crackling gravel as you drive over dirt roads, which are authentic enough to bring back memories of rural life.Despite these very small improvements, this game just doesn't seem like the depicted improvement upon an already fantastic Farming Simulator 15.  This is the only game I have ever requested a refund on, and it hurts to say so as I was really looking forward to everything this game appeared to be.  It is simply not enjoyable, and I can't see spending more than 10 hours trudging through an inferior version of this series."

Also Train Simulator also is either free or at a reduced rate to existing game owners.If it wasn’t for the in-game Massey Ferguson’s I wouldn’t have bother this time upgrading to FS17.I think this will be the last time I bother with the game series, which is a massive shame as I was a huge fan of FS11 and FS13, but unless something changes.

The game looks great, the vehicles operated smoother ect..   I like the new map looks and layout.The problem is the way you can make money.  I played farm sim 15 thousands of hours.  I like to manage the farm and hire workers while keeping the equipment running while I buy and move equipment etc.  I was never into running a combine for hours and hours, but didnt mine hauling grain and selling it, while someone drove the combine and I took care of the animals,etc.  You can not hire people and make money in 17.  I have played 20 hours so far and barely have any money.  Equipment costs and hired help cost eat up anything  you make.  I tried the leasing way and started making a little more money but not enough to make the game move at a speed that makes you feel like you are progessing.  If you cant progress at a good rate the game gets old running the same equipmnet over the same fields.  The only way is to go and manually farm other people's fields.Too slow of progression is killing the game for me."

I played FS in the past and when a friend wanted to play together on a dedicated server I was excited. After playing for 3 days I can say that FS17 is a buggy, incomplete, at best beta, game. I regularly have problems, everything from part of the HUD disappearing on different parts of the map to the save file completely disappearing.Another issue I have had with all of the FS games is that is seems like such a great and fun idea, BUT the game is lacking in some MAJOR areas. Here are just a few:1. The banking and loan system is a complete joke. They could do SO much. I own a small business and working with banks and financing is a major part of business.2.  This daily cost per equipment is on an unrealistic scale and is laughable.  Its almost like they tried to balance the game with using it.  I am sorry but if I don't use my combine for a day it doesn't get more wear and tear and shouldn't cost me.3.  Preferences are NEVER saved. Very annoying that I have to change settings every time I load the saved game.4.  The NEW SHINY TRAIN is a gimmick and I never used it (half the time it wouldn't even work anyway).Like I said, only a few things off the top of my head.The ONLY thing this game has going for it is the amazing MOD community. To the people that give this great reviews, stop selling yourself short.  You should expect so much more for your hard earned money.It just seems they just added a few small things to the game and just changed the date on the title from 15 to 17.   22 hours of my life I won't get back."

Apparently it was too difficult programming to just remove the skin, the whole tractors went awal. Oh well...Then the early game version had a bug in the silage bunker, some stuff was hidden inside the wall and couldn't be removed. Result: blocked silage bunker, one use only. Next cracked version had a bug fix though. Happy days.Now I have the official game, same problem, but worse. Nice one devs. Silage is actually visible now, is even noticable when driving over it, but can't be removed by belt, scoop or powerfood sucker. Pitty I already removed the crack.Apart from these things the game suffers from some hit box programming lazyness, which is not so bad when working a field as one can see what ones doing, but when you're cutting tree stumps it can become very frustrating to find the actual hitbox of it, which can sometimes be as far off as a meter or so. Also a previuos bug fix for trees not falling over after cutting them seems not to be working anymore in this official version.So do I recommend this game? Actually, yes. I've played quite a lot of time more than is visible on my account. I would even say it's very addictive if you're into the more relaxing sort of game. For now however  I would not recommend buying the game untill these issues get solved."

There are a few improvements such as pigs, and additional ways to take care of the animals.  There is also additional crops you can grow and harvest.  Also they have added a train to transport goods to train specific stores to sell.  As far as gameplay, it is virtually identical to Farming Simulator 13 and 15.  The graphics are also basically identical.  In Farming Simulator 17, several things are very clunky and much more difficult.  Example:  The chaff / silage area is much more difficult to fill, cover, and empty.  The trucks or tractors easily become stuck if not emptied in a very specific way.  The silage also does not automatically uncover when it is finished fermenting, instead you have to walk or drive onto it for a small area to uncover.My overall assessment of FS17 is it is Ok - no major updates or upgrades - just minor changes and improvements depending on your perspective.  If you already have FS15, keep it and enjoy and don't waste your money upgrading to FS17 (yet).  Also, one of the most important parts about Farminng Simulator games are the mods - which I have read Giants (the maker of Farming Simulator) is finally starting to implement and integrate.  There are very few mods available for Farming Simulator 17 at this time.  I have heard Giants plans to release some very popular mods as a part of a DLC upgrade (more $$) including courseplay.

Then you can walk on said tree while it is resting on the car and cut off the limbs. After this you can cut it to smaller pieces and drag them over the hood of a car, again without any penalty. You can do this as many times as you want on another person's property and completely deforest land you don't own...without penalty.Cons:- Physics are horrible. If you cut a tree down there is a chance it could drop right through the earth. Things will start to bounce around at random and act rubbery.- Collisions are messed up. If you are plowing a flat field you will probably be fine but the moment you start to navigate precarious equipment in tight circumstances things will start to either pass completely through other items and scenery or they will get stuck in it entirely. Light poles and railroad fences are notorious for grabbing onto my farm and forestry equipment.- The ""simulation"" factor is pretty low. If you are a fan of heavy equipment and get a kick out of that aspect you will find that you can't press any buttons or interact with the equipment other than by using a few keymaps or by sliding the mouse around. If you are a fan of farm management you will be disappointed to know that instead of hiring and managing staff you just press H to hire a person to do the job you are currently doing and it ""auto-drives"" your tractor. Books management boils down to paying off a debt the game automatically just hands you (or collecting more debt), and you can't even have equipment or seed delivered to your farm. The store you buy pallets of seed from doesn't even have a forklift to load your seed pallets.- The UI is terrible. Nearly everything in the game is icon based yet you can't mouse over anything to see what it is. You are just expected to know the symbol for a certain type of plant or seed.- Menu system is not very good. Why should I have to save the game then exit to the main menu just to see the entire keymap? That should be visible in the game.- AI vehicles and ""NPC's.""- Annoying pop-ups in the game that will stop you from driving until you click them away.- Walking near a tree with a chainswa will give you a ""cut ring"" maybe 1 in 10 times making it frustrating to cut down trees. (then you watching about half of them slide straight into the earth and disappear).- Originally I had the train as a pro because I thought it was cool. That was before I tried using it to haul logs. Even if you cut the logs to length and stack them evenly so they shouldn't move they will end up bouncing all over the place like rubber. I lost every single log going 30-40kph, watching them all shoot into the air like rockets! I've never seen anything like it...- I have encountered a bug in literally every tutorial I have done...all of them related to poor physics. After having a tree fall through the earth on the forestry tutorial I decided to abandon forestry until they patch it. I decided that maybe animals would be a good way to go. After dumping the feed into the trough my tractor did a front flip into the air and landed in the pig pin..."

I had to delete that game after 114 hours of playing, complete waist of time. when you have animals they spill outside the trough whitch is ok. but you spend all your time cleaning up around  the trough so you can get 100% production or be penalized, another thing that is too time consuming, you can't play the game, because you are always cleaning up around the trough. I don't like the hour meter on tractors . you use them like 7 times in you field and they are done and have to buy new one , might as well stay with small cheep equipment if you have to throw them away or be charged for being devalued, I mean who can afford to buy $300,000.00 pice of equipment every 34 hour of use.

The company is incredibly greedy, forcing you to buy 2 copies to run a multiplayer server (unheard of in gaming).  The 'official' community is terrible, if you don't like the bugs, they verbally attack you.   Multiplayer itself is a really bad implemenation.  Everytime a player logs into a server, everyone must wait up to 5 minutes for them to 'synchronize'. There are no admin controls and plenty of little children to ruin your day.  The game itself is a fun concept, but it's not worth the trouble.  Frankly, They need some strong competition to force them to be better.If you own it, it's fun to play, but if you don't I would stay away."

Feel ripped off, yet?Eventually I might get to play.  Spent the past half hour jumping in and out of the game trying to configure the keys.  You can't do it within the game.  And for some reason, every time you set a key outside the game it reloads the graphics from scratch.  Worse still, the names of the keybindings outside the game are misleading.

Easy to play even when I have to get up early the next day.  No complicated thinking required.CONS-Wonky Physics.  There's been a time or two where a trailer did not go where it was supposed to or wobbled uncontrollably.NEUTRAL-Questing:  Time Investment = Money.  The larger the field you work for a neighbor the more you'll make doing it, but you'll spend a greater amount of time doing it too.  For instance, I spent 40 minutes plowing Goldcrest Field 20, (second largest field on map) Not game minutes.  Real, live human minutes.  Of course, the dollar yeild on this was about $100,000.

Well FS17 improves on Fs15 in every way, it feels more complete as a game, pretty much has all the DLC from the last game as standard. The missions actually have a point this time round, pay more,  and actually teach you to be better at driving the machinery. Graphically an also in the audio front its a big improvement over FS15 especially the lighting. Also it seems the economy is more balanced, which should provide a much longer endgame and makes buying equipment far more strategic as funds have to be worked for.Mods are where FS15 really excelled, but thankfully Giants have kept the mod support and improved on it a lot. Definitely worth the upgrade of FS15."

Structuers for the game is very impressive, well detail too, it just has the feeling of new but old fashion farming places they outdone themselves on that.

This is one of the few sims that I've played where it continually gets better and better each release, and I believe that it is very tough to do. There's enough reviews out there to tell you what to expect in this years FS, but I want to give the FS developers a lot of praise for improving the core elements of this game. I know improving the core elements of games sounds simplistic, but a lot developers go off on experiments that can end up ruining the experience for dedicated users, and the FS developers have continually found ways to add new things to the sim, yet not take away from the realism and gameplay.They've also provided DLC in previous FS (and I'm sure they will in FS17 as well) that actually feels like you are getting your moneys worth, and I can think of only one other sim out there that does that (Euro Truck Simulator 2). I've purchased every single addon for this sim in previous versions, and while they don't have tons of different DLC options, the ones they have to choose from our high quality and worth having.In final, if you're looking for a solid casual simulator, this is one of very few I can recommend.

Nothing scary in it, and nothing remotely violent whatsoever. However, although the game can be played without it, the game does allow for online activity such as listening to livestreams Which can be disabled, and multiplayer mode. However, with the multiplayer mode can set up a server that is password protected and you can also block entry of people you don't recognize immediately when they try to join. Please keep the game in an offline mode or don't purchase it if you don't feel your child can be trusted with these features. They are extremely fun and beneficial features if they are trustworthy, however.Gameplay benefits:High educational value -1. Game follows laws of supply and demand2. Vehicles depreciate,3. Money can be borrowed from the bank, but you have to pay interest4. Money can be earned by helping other farmers or selling commodities.5. You pay fees for things such as fertilizers, vehicle maintenance, and  hiring workers.Due to the above, I highly recommend it to someone who wants their child to learn, and practice, budgeting skills.1. Soil compacts over time, plow it on occaision2. You can use real agriculture methods such as crop-cycling due to crop types such as oilseed radishes.3. Different crop types have different yields and prices they can be sold for.4. Planting and harvesting different crops requiresMultiplayer can be good and bad, as if your child is trustworthy with such features multiple people in the household can play with each other.Noteworthy gameplay:No part of this game has anything I am worried about a child seeing for any reason, which may be why children that are used to the violent aspects of most video games consider the game boring.You start off on either map with one field ready to harvest, of which the combine is already out on the field ready to be used, once you attach the header. It will explain in the tutorial on the Goldcrest valley map tutorial how to drive it. After harvesting the field, you can decide on whether to sell the grain now, or store it. If you decide to sell it, different buyers offer different prices for the harvest, so I recommend looking at the prices in the menu that they are currently offering. You drive a trailer filled with the grain to the selling point of your choice and dump it into the designated area. In the meantime, you can have workers cultivate and replant your fields. Your start off in debt, and the starting loan differs in size according to difficulty, in easy it is $50,000. in Normal it is $100,000. Once you have replanted your fields, you increase the timescale and, of course, wait for the fresh crop to grow to a ripe state. You can fertilize and weed your fields to increase the final yield. You can buy new machinery at the shop and sell your old equipment. Unlike previous games, your equipment depreciates and will have MUCH lower value than your purchase price.Dowside(s):It usually takes a lot of gameplay to progress, and the gameplay might be considered repetitive.Believe me, if someone likes this game, it is quite easy to lose track of the time.I highly recommend this game for anyone who dreasm of becoming a farmer someday who is trustworthy with online features."

Now with the mod for FS17 to add the effects of when it rains and your tires sink into the ground thats really cool to watch.Its also the small things in the game that really makes this a great game specially when i'm in my Harvester and I'm harvesting my hard grown crops I noticed that my Harvester is actually bouncing to give it a feel that your actually in the vehicle when I go into 1st person view kinda makes me feel car sick sometimes lol. I also like the ability to lease out a tool or vehicle when you don't really have the money to actually buy one right off the bat. Depending on what you get you could save your self a lot of money. I also like the fact you will have to upgrade your vehicles at some point because they have been used to much and the cost of maintaining them is getting to high almost like a real tracker. Its even harder when you actually try Hard difficulty and almost all your money is going into your crappy old beginner vehicles and not able to pay your loan off.Now I haven't actually figured out which is the best crop to grow (and if anyone does please message me about it) but I don't mind learning all this even if I make a major mistake like trying to grow one crop and then growing different without realizing it again another user error. But to feel like your actually there working the field and cutting down the trees to make more room for your self makes this game an outstanding game I would recommend this game to everyone who did play FS15 and if you are new or curious about this try it and always remember have patience sometimes it may take forever to figure it out but in the end its rewarding when you see your self cutting down your crops and making a major profit so again try it and just have the patience."

Now lets just sit down and talk about HOW AMAZING THE LIGHTING AND GRAPHICS ARE! First of all the beacons reflec now *thumbs up* The sounds are more realistic than the previous and actually sounds relativly good. Now you can do contracts which goes both ways. Pro: Adds another factor into the game while you wait for fields to grow. Con: Makes it a little to easy to make money. One big contract and you just made 100k. BUUUUT they also added trains which is so cool. Now i dont have to go play Train Sim anymore. There are plentiful amount of vehicles now and they look stunning, and sounds good aswell (never felt that was really a problem in 15). Remember when i was talking about animals? Well imma dive in now! Your cows dont magically pop up anymore. They breed! Aswell as you can have pigs without the mod now! I lied about the sound the ckickens sunds terrible. I almost get a vibe that you could pretty much almost be a rancher now which ads another inplement into the game, Plowing/tilling the land finally makes a difference!!!!!!! (makes me so god damn happy!)  Pretty cool how the added a radio aswell. All in all im in love with the game, really enjoying myself. If you liked the earlier FS games, this one wont disappoint.9.5/10 Would recomendCons:- Rain still clips trough buildings (so there is no sense in parking them indoors)- No preview when customizing vehicles.- Still no ground deformation. I would have loved to see this in the game. (Im sure mods will fix this)- I hate how in every game cows, sheep, and (now pigs) are never around your farm.

The developers didn't really go into detail of what they were changing for this game and i feel like they should have because the game made alot of changes and mostly for the better. The fields have better textures and a a small amount of 3d effects to make it look more realistic. The game has new mechanics that make the game harder, which it really needed since i thought FSA 15 was too easy. Some changes they made that i really like are: Seeds are no longer infinite spot in your farm, you now have to buy seed pallets that makes having a front loader more valuable not to mention you can now move your seed stocks around using a trailer so no longer having to drive all the way to your farm to load your seeder.  Finally straps, now you can strap your bales or logs to their trailers, so no more just falling off.  And something nobody has mentioned, 4K support, this game looks so good in 4K and the UI automatically scales which is a HUGE plus for me.  and another major change i really like is the mission system, now you work for other farmers and gain reputation with them that makes it cheaper to buy fields. Also missions are now about farming no more pallet racing. There are other things i really like but too much to write down, this game is a must buy for sim lovers."

Being able to tweak a variety of different settings to make your own experience the way you want it to be.The addition to the mods menu and link strainght to the website to seemlessly download mods direct into game is just what was needed, although support for the steam workshop would of been a nice addition to.The increased crops and animals as well as vehicles and equipment makes a nice change to the norm that we're all used to from previous FS games however they did leave some of the old favourites. The addition of being able to lease vehicles within the store menu as well as customizing is excellent, but it would of been nice to be able to see a preview of the additions made during customization.All in all this is a good game and like any game has it good points and bad points, in this case the good outnumber the bad, and with Giants always updating and improving thigs you won't be dissapointed with this addition to the Farm Sim franchise."

Whether it's the better feel of a true campaign with the addition of helping other farmers, or the ability to make minor adjustments to personalize your farm with buildings and placeable objects. The devs have really done good on their part by polishing a previously great game series by bringing in better graphics and a more well rounded game with a lot more to keep you occupied instead of walking away from your computer until your next harvest is available. The ability to continue to play while other parts of the game, like waiting for your crops to grow, can do so much to improve the amount of enjoyment people get.Sort-of-cons: Slow going on the early gameplayDuring my initial playthrough, for those that have already played other farming sims, I did eventually come to a point where I would have liked to buy bigger and better stuff to expand my farm. Which in all honesty is the point of it all, but I felt myself coming to a split in my decision on how to do it, eventually I decided it would be easier to sell everything and farm up about 100 beehouses to have a large free income while I spent my real world time eating, watching videos, or doing other useless things around my house. On the other hand I could have just went to other local farms and worked their fields while I waited for my own to be harvestable, but I quickly realised that while I was speeding up game time while I was waiting, the mission system puts everything back at normal speed. Which to be fair is how it should be, seeing as the game uses the time clock to monitor how fast you work the fields. This made me feel like I was lacking in getting my fields closer to being ready, so I opted to go the AFK free money route until I could have free income to progress the game a little faster."

The graphics have been updated, and more features and vehicles have been added. I have always been a fan of the Farming simulator franchise. It is a very relaxing game and can keep me farming for hours.Pros:There are a ton of mods. There are some that even cause the realistic plant damage mod, meaning that when you run over your plant when its growing it will die wherever you run over. Many mods also add new vehicles.Graphics are improved & lighting is a lot better, without sacrificing performance. I have a gtx 760, and it runs very smoothlyThey have really revamped the job system. It allows you to make a significant amount of money while getting to use the higher tier machines. Much better than the previous front-loader based jobs.They added trains to the game. It doesn't add a whole lot to the gameplay, however it is a pretty cool addition.Cons-The game limits the number of workers that you can have working at one time.

I am primarily a 'Crop' guy, and thus the multiple fertilzer rounds one has to do during a growth cycle and the plowing every so often between cycles, go a long way to add reality. I just wish they would have added the need for having to spray for weeds and pests during each growth cycle as well, with a Growth cycle that would only go to the next stage at midnight and where weather also plays it's part. Hence, ""Soil mod"" would be ever so welcome!!! Can't wait for it to come out for FS17!Very active modding community and some very usefull mods that can be had. Many of which I feel should have but are not included in the base game such as the ""Soil Mod"" option. The game is certainly very playable and you can get everything done without mods, but there comes a time in the game when you wish you could get your hands on some seriously heavy equipment. Like the type they use at the open coal mines, to load 50 tons of stuff at a time...The money is there, but the tools are not! Which is why I feel that mods will eventually be a ""must have"" for any Player in order to play with the ""Big Boys"", especially during the mid and late game stages, depending on your area of speciality!Nonetheless! GREAT GAME Overall! Which will keep you busy for many hours, espcially on hard mode where it's very easy to find yourslef in debt over and over again! Just like it is with real farmers! - That's if you like a challange and are prepared to avoid the ""Make me money quickly"" mods! Which are availble of course and can be useful in case you find yourself in uncontrolable debt. Although there are tougher ways to get out of such debt, like fulfulling contracts for other in game farmers for instance - or just work harder and stop buyng what you don't really need right now! Just like real life! ENJOY!"

Animal interaction is now more interesting, though I'm still waiting for more improvements here. Tiedowns on bale trailers is a huge improvement, though they still need a bit more tweaking, and I'd like to see them work on vehicles and implements, not just pallets and bales. Graphics are a bit better, though you won't see much difference. Most of the graphical improvements are more subtle, such as the tires crushing a little under a load, better dirt buildup, driving on grass/gravel/pavement cleaning your tires of some dirt (with an offical mod), better lighting and shadow quality (strobes reflecting on objects is amazing).Overall, I would definitely recommend FS17.

Most of the changes from Farming Simulator 15 are subtle but make the game much more enjoyable. Kudos to the developers for including TrackIR support! However, the control mapping process is frustrating because you cannot map the controls without restarting the game. The developers need to add a screen that allows you to test the controls similar to a calibration screen or a quick machine minigame so that you don't have to keep restarting a map to test your controls. Also, please add native support for wheels and multiple controllers. Right now, I have to manually switch files if I have to change controllers (from wheel with hotas to xbox). Overall, this game is awesome improvement from FS15 if you want a tad bit better graphics, lots of subtle usability improvements, all the previous dlc content included, and even more crops and machines to keep you entertained!"

I have only played the multiplayer, so I cannot comment on how the single player campaign differs. To its credit, Farm Sim is an ideal filler of a void my friends and I had with games that required pure team-work - you simply can't deviate away from the tasks at hand.On a Medium difficulty server, we played organically for the first while with the default equipment but ended up in debt. Thankfully, you are offered huge perks and freedoms as a server admin, including the ability to award yourself money. From there, we purchased a fleet of tractors, combine harvesters and equipment necessary to herd cows (i.e. trailer, hay baler etc.).I did find the forestry tutorial extremely difficult to complete (on an Xbox 360 controller) due to the vast array of controls necessary to pick up a log onto a trailer. Perhaps this was down to me, but I would like to see the inclusion of restarting a tutorial from the last checkpoint as opposed to starting over.I have only scratched the surface with this game, but I will update this review over the Christmas period if I experience something new. For now, I firmly believe Farm Sim '17 can appeal to non-farm enthusiasts like me, but bring some friends if you can!"

I really like the new missions or contracting system, makes it a lot more interesting and you get to test out the high-end machines at the very beginning of the game.

I lumped for a pre-order of FS17 and have not been disappointed! Granted there were a few bugs at launch (not game breaking mind you!) but the community feedback has been crucial in driving improverments to the game. 3 big patches since launch and major issues resolved pretty quickly, kudos to the developers! The Mod syustem has now been built directly into the game, making it easier to download mods and also see what mods you are missing if trying to join a multiplayer game. The improvements to the dedicated server app have also made me plunge for my own dedicated server... this game is taking over my life! Works very well on my Core I7 laptop with intergrated Nvidia chipset, even better on the gaming rig and runs like a sweety over Steam Link as well. Great work on this expansion, the mod community will keep this game alive for years to come."

Im going to give my opinions.Pros:Way better menuIn game mod downloadingBetter graphicsPICKING UP LOGSMore machinesBetter presentationMore activities.Cons:More bugs than usual including these(Grass appears inside of the fields, logs lean at a 45 degree angle against nothing, ai is just bad, trailers still screw up the basic laws of suspension and traction)Europe has the brand of John Deere, there could be some john deere tractors but hey, it can wait.The pick up trucks just suckJobs give you more money than a stomache surgeonIs this game worth 30 dollars? Almost. About 78% of it is worth it, which isnt bad for a new game, but should be higher for a company whos released 2 farming games on the same engine. FS15 was a master piece in my mind. If the devs some how read this: Please look at fixing the bugs before dlc. I know the game is fairly new but follow train simulator, yearly installments that get tested for an entire year and is 1 game so that you fans dont pay so much.Update. Since the recent updates ive been noticing bugs being fixed. First of the pick up trucks are now worth having, the grass bug is still there but it is going away. I havent tried jobs but i think they are still high. I love the fact that grass bales are still there. Id say now, the game is about 90% worth the money. Its a little high but Id buy it and play it any day."

,Recommended,447020,29128506,Posted: 8 January,all,drewski8484,"Someone described Farm Sim 17 being the proper evolultion of the prior two generations, and I fully agree - the fields and equipment match nicely, foresty works well, there are many new great features that used to be available only as mods, the availble equipment is nicer, and it all feels right. Granted, I think most people had modded FS15 into whatever they wanted it to be, but this seems right from the start. Beyond adding a few trucks and maybe some other bits I don't feel that there is any point to adding to what is already there. I also really like that there aren't empty fields, they are all owned by AI farmers, and instead of running around doing delivery for cash early in the game now you can work the AI farmer's fields for cash. Overall a great experience and a big enough improvement to justify spending money on."

From ""simple"" farming, to animal care, to potato crops, to logging, to driving trains, to watching the day/night/weather cycle from infinite locations of the beautiful world, this game will always have you wondering what needs your attention right now, and what you could be doing or exploring next.And finally, you will never feel ripped off by this game, unlike other simulators which make you buy add-ons to have a more complete world.

For example it would be nice to have Volvo wheel loaders.John Deere would be nice to have without mods too. It is such a big brand so I was a little shocked it wasnt already in the game.Komatsu is also something that would be nice to have so there is a little more to choose between.Otherwise I really like the game. Specially the forestry. Hard in the beginning but gets easier for every minute you play and so with the farming too.Solid 9/10.

As a long time player of farming simulator 2015, I wasn't expecting much of a change in this iteration, but I am glad to say I was wrong.  Not only have many of the mechanics been improved ot make things more realistic, but the graphics are insanely gorgeous!  Even the DIRT looks awesome- something we take for granted in real life, but is difficult to reproduce in a game/simulation.My only suggestion for improvement in an update would be water.  Mud puddles should be splashed through, streams that are forded should have the water pushed around the tires, and the water should really be moving better than it is.  I know water is a difficult thing to reproduce, but many graphic designers are doing it pretty well now.  I also want to see MUD.  Oozing, squeezed, pushed, rutted mud.  When the mud dries, I want to see the ruts left behind.    Also, I want to see dirt clods falling off the tractors, especially on roads, not just tire tracks (which is great, don't get me wrong!).My last suggestion is the 1st person view.  I believe walking shouldn't be more like... gliding.  I need to see my legs and feet.  I need to see my hands and arms.  I want to see my hands on the steering wheels turning the wheel and allowing it to slide back through my hands.Even with these missing items, I would still highly recommend the game!I'd rate the simulation/game at a 8.5 out of 10. The additional 1.5 could be made up with splashing mud puddles, mud, water, and the 1st person view."

Just to start things off these two tractors are an amazing addition to the game that I am quite thankful to have.The two base maps themselves (Goldcrest Valley and Sosnovka) are great starting maps and are quick to memorize. Even if you do get bored of these maps, you have the Giants ModHub to use to find other good maps that may give you a bit more of a challenge.Also thanks to the ModHub, there are also many other mods available for almost anything you can imagine and they're all so easy to install and use.Multiplayer is also quite good as well considering I don't exactly have the BEST of computers to play on, but the game still manages to run quite smoothly.I was really impressed with how well this game runs though, as I said before I don't have a great computer where I run most games around 20FPS but Giants have done a GREAT job at making the game run smoothly as I can easily hit 40FPS and usually play with medium graphics.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to pass time, mess around, have some fun with friends or set up their own entire farm- Either a crop farm, Sheep, Cow, Pig farm or even get into the forestry business.10/10 Would play again."

Auto route or courseplay don't seem to work properly or don't work at all. Follow me mod is working, this saves you from driving every vehicle and allows you to automate some processes.In general it feels like you have to do a lot of driving and I don't really enjoy that. I prefer managing stuff.The good part is, the game feels more realistic than fs 15 and they've implemented some of the mods from fs15 into it. The mod manager makes it really easy to have control over the mods.It also feels like the game wants to become a multi player game, haven't tried it like this yet."

However I find that the multiplayer leaves somthing to be desired. The market should be more of a global thing between all servers that are set up. If not that then there needs to be farms that other players can play so there is some sort of competition instead of just running around a map with no real challange. Other than that I give the game 4 Stars

Then Yes.If you want an active game, then no.To FS11/13/15 players:The game is an upgrade to all the previous games, however the leap from Fs15 to Fs17 is not the largest, I found that it was worth it, but you may not. Graphically speaking its the same. Gameplay wise its the same old in a new box. It's a good game and better than Fs15, so if you have the spare money laying around, I would strongly suggest this game!"

This game is fun but full of bugs in the walking mode. I feel like the walking mode should be better than it is, you are actually a god and can fly using logs. I feel like you should be able to get in accidents with the other cars to maybe damage your machines or maybe your health and if your health reaches 0 it could skip a week so your crops aren't tended to.

Of course it is missing some brands and equipment I wish it had. They really need to expand on the pickups, and light duty dump trucks too. Like have the ram 1500 eco diesel, the ram 2500 cummins like I own. Also the chevy and fords three quarter ton and one tons as well. Be nice to see some 5500 dump trucks as well. I don't undersand were John Deere machines are and CAT are. I own all Case equipment, and they make some nice skid steers as well, plus cat, kubota, bobcat, and John Deere. I also own a Mack dump truck, would be nice to see some more american style trucks and dumps as well. I don't know if they have license problems for all these brands, but some talentent modders do a fine job making new equipment. There's also some forestry equipment missing that I use too, but that's not the main point of this game. It would be cool if the game had dealerships you go too, with maybe some tractors on display in town. It's a very relaxing game for me, and I enjoy orgainzing my farming operations with multiple machines running. One more thing, to save money I pick up all my seed and fertilizer at the store and load it on trailers. It would be nice if they had silows that you drove your truck under to buy in bulk at a cheaper price or bigger pallets. This game will probably only get better, and I do reccomend Farming Simulater 17."

The core game has alot of items for you to buy which is good for those who don't want to use mods. The physics and workers have also been updated from FS15. The changes seem to be big, in my opinion.The game also have more livestock with the addition of pigs. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but the pigs have a varied diet which means that you have to put down some serious work until you can afford having any. This means having another goal to work towards.However, even though they have added the possibility to use straps to secure cargo such as bales and logs, they still haven't fixed what I feel is a physics issue where bales are easily tipped over and shuffled around during the loading of trailers. This is my only real negative thought about the game so far. And the fact that it is really addictive..."

76561198384036069,Recommended,447020,32521642,Posted: 17 June,all,MayTheSchwartzBeWithYou,"Farming Simulator 17 is fantastic, apparently the best in the series in terms of graphics, game mechanics, machinery and overall gameplay. I can definitely vouch that its good but its my first Farming Simulator game besides a miniscule amount of time on Farming Sim 15. I've never considered myself to actually be playing a Farming Simulator game because of all the hardcore FPS, open world games and strategy games that are out there. Its an amazing game, relaxing and a welcome refresher. From operating huge machinery tending your fields and selling your crops for profit, creating a lumber operation (Every tree on the map is able to processed and sold) or taking care of sheep, pigs and cows you have the option of playing as the farmer you want to be. If you even want to farm at all! Its up to you. The open world and first person character give the game new life and a welcome perspective for even more realism. Ive only had a few gripes with the game. It runs great at 4k resolution at max settings (Running a GTX1070 16gb ram and intel i7 3.8ghz) but ocasionally the tractors start to stutter and the frame rate dips, apparently a bug from the last update with the game that has not been fixed. I dont encounter the problem often, but its a quick fix with a save, quit and reload. The game only takes a few seconds to load which is great. Also Im having a problem accessing a save with 40+ hours which is frustrating. Other then that the game runs great from what ive experienced with almost 50 hours. With an extremely large modding community with built in support to being able to play with 16 other people in multiplayer you wont run out of stuff to do. Never thought I would but I highly recommend Farming Sim 17."

76561197974112108,Recommended,447020,35095248,Posted: 20 September,all,SpidyM,"Game bought on sale! (50% off) Ok have played well over 150 hours on farm sim 15 and 50 hours on farm sim 13.... Farm sim 17 is an upgrade from the previous Farm sim 15. It has brought with it all the great features of 15 and added more content (a lot more machinery to buy which is great!)  slightly better graphics ( new particle/dust effects, textures look slightly better) and of course 2 new maps to play on in the stock game.First off It took a bit to get back into farm sim but once i had harvested my first field I was ready to rock n roll and take a look at what new things the game had to offer...and then came (in my opinion) the biggest blunder of Farm sim 17....missions!! unlike 13 and 15 to make some extra money...you dont have a phone for mission (13) or various mission posts on the map (15) instead you have the ability to help other farmers by going to the sign where you would usually buy the field, and you get offered a job to harvest their field (or sow, plough or wotever) and you get paid once its done....heres the thing though....some of these missions pay very well (the more you do for that person the cheaper the field becomes if you want to buy it) AND the person your working for lends you their own machines for the job... So i cant help wondering that If your doing lots of these missions and making good money easily AND not needing to use your own tractors...well (for me anyway)...it hardly seems worth bothering to harvest your own fields...which take longer as you have to plough, cultivate, sew, blahblah...pay any helpers etc.... and take forever to make around the same money you get for missions.....and this takes the fun out of trying to build up a farm for me....Im sure others will like the new mission system but i certainly dont.I would still recommend the game....although id say for those who own sim 2015...wait till this comes out on sale...as it aint a vast improvement over 15 and as ive mentioned above...it has its downsides...at least for me anyways. Newcomers if you dont mind the mission side of it...by all means give this one a go...its still a great simulator"

First off, I love the game as you can probably tell by my hours played. I enjoy games that allow me to build slowly over time, and I don't like easy quick gratification games. I spent prolly the first 100 hours just trying new maps, learning the game, basically just getting a plan together. Finally I settle on Westbridge Hills, I spent the next 300 hours building a business, no money mods, just hard work and time. I like that I can come home from work, spend an hour baleing hay, feeding animals or whatever, save the game and log out, no strings attached like a MMO, which is my normal sort of game. As all gamers know, it is very important to save regularly in this sort of game, one power flicker from a storm or whatever, and you just lost an hours work, or even more if you're not careful, so I save on a regular basis. So this is where the bad comes in. I get up on Saturday and start my normal deal, let's get this field mowed before I have to leave for the day,  I get it done, save the game, and leave. I come home later that day, log into the game and POOF!!,, all placables, as well as equipment is GONE!!,, just gone..  I still have my money, but everything, and I mean everything else is just gone. I don't want to give the game a bad review, I feel that I certainly got my monies worth if you figure the hours of play time that I enjoyed, but I still had big plans for that farm. I tried to just say the heck with it and start a new one, on a new map, but it went from a fun process, to just plain work.  I'm sure you smart computer guys know a way to have a back up save, so you could have gotten around this, but I just counted on the game save alone. I don't want to spend more time learning to hack game files, than I do enjoying a game. I'm gonna leave a thumbs up, since it really is a cool game, but with a warning. If you lose all those hours, well that's just to damn bad."
