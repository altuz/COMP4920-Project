This pushed the asepct of a little function into a full on game. Game's like Braid , Some zelda games , ect don't make you feel like you're alone. More like you are just doing the commands they tell you, this game feels like you are alone no one is here and no one is around you. I'd say this is the best game I've played in 2017. Great job on your amazing game."
,Recommended,447210,30437348,Posted: 10 March,all,RayZahBoi // Sleepy,This game is both beautiful and creative. Was reffered from dued of Roblox after having his quick promotional event for this game. It's extremely unique and has great art and music. Would love to see more of your work!

,Recommended,447210,30563936,Posted: 16 March,all,Peril,"I love the concept behind this game. It has an amazing feel to it. It has a gently guiding story to it, and a calming soundtrack. My only complaint is that, even on low graphics and on a laptop that can run 3d games like counter-strike, I get lag sometimes. This is a combination of FPS and issues where interactive objects won't respond. I'm not sure if this is because it's programmed in ActionScript or because of the particle count, but I'd love to see more work on performance improvements."

In order to defeat it you and something from another species that looks like a spirit have to go on a long journey. I don't want to say too much so I'm leaving it there.Don't get this if you don't like puzzles as you have to do lots of them."

,Recommended,447210,30438045,Posted: 10 March,all,nothing,Got this expecting to see something similar to a Playdead platformer. It did not disappoint. The story was pretty cool. Not very in depth but I enjoyed playing through it.

,Recommended,447210,30480810,Posted: 12 March,all,KyleKidd,"First Impression Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wzpcMX7zPE&feature=youtu.beBlink is a fun little side scrolling adventure game with a unique twist.  The game world can be swapped at will between the normal version, and a version where you can interact with light.  Light in the game world is dynamic, and can be changed to solve sticky situations and get through hard to pass areas.PROS-Very nice art style-Unique game mechanic-Awesome sound track-Interesting story-Interesting environment-Responsive controls-Ever changing scenery-Did not stumble across any bugs or issues with running the game-Price feels like it is on pointCons-Could take a little while to get used to the main game mechanic-Voice acting is in the form of grunts, and I wish we would get a little more interaction from the NPCs"

76561198324718706,Recommended,447210,34276038,Posted: 16 August,all,souperdouper,"Blink is overall a really decent game. I only had two problems with it, one being that the boss felt a little rushed and was a tad bit easy. I didn't realize that it was a boss fight for a few seconds. The other problem was that the game was short. The puzzles were clever, the gimmick was fun, but it was short, leaving me wanting much much more. That being said, it's a fantastic game. It might take a bit, but eventually you grow to like the pixelation style, and it's music is serene and calming. You don't get mad when you fail over and over again. In Conclusion: it's a good, fun 2-3.5 hour game, with amazingly clever puzzles. I would recommend this game to anyone who has time to spare and loves some good puzzle games. Keep up the good work, NextReality!"
