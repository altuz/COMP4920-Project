,Not Recommended,447290,34006630,Posted: 3 August,all,RAPTER,"I have mixed feelings about this game. If I could give it a Thumbs-Sideways or 50/50 rating, I would.It plays the way it was advertised to be: a headfirst, violent close-quarter melee/shooter game... taking similar designs and concepts from Hotline Miami. The graphics look pretty good, but requires a bit of optimization (at least when maxed out), because my beefy GTX 1080 build started to get some heavy fps drops during certain levels. That being said, the graphics doesn't sell the game for me. I bought the game merely because it gave me the Hotline Miami vibe, and the game mimicked it pretty well.The controls ran pretty solid for keyboard & mouse. I didn't have any issues learning the controls, it's pretty easy to get the hang of it very early in the game. If you're a slow learner, you'll figure out the hard way. The movement feels smooth, and the aiming is on point. Rolling is a cool and a VERY useful feature, but more importantly the Parry system. Parrying is essential, so get the hang of it quick... it's as easy as tapping Q while spamming attacks, get the feel for it and you'll be fine.Now for the bad part. What the game lacks for an interesting story, it makes up for it's violent gameplay, which I expected and isn't such a big deal to me. However, just like Doom, it gets extremely repetitive in terms to killing. And eventually, you'll find out that there's not that many ways to kill your enemies. You either melee them to death, shoot them to death, or use the environment to kill your enemies (which isn't that special to be honest). You may be using different weapons to kill things, but you're killing them the same way, but NOT that large of an arsenal, which is sadly disappointing. And trust me when I say this, you'll be killing A LOT, and for the most part, killing them in the SAME WAYS. Did I say that already? Yeah repetitive.If you're someone like me, and a game becomes more of a grind to beat the game because you're getting bored with doing the samething over and over again... Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game. AND if you're someone who likes to casually play a game without dealing with VERY difficult level designs (annoyingly difficult I may say), then also don't buy this game. Now if you like a challenge, and don't mind doing the samething, and can handle a bit of annoyance then go for it! Bonus points for Hotline Miami vibe users!Now for the things that truly annoys the living crap out of me = bad:The Grappling Attack - certain enemies can do this, and when they do it consistently and at the worst times, it's more than just an absolute annoyance. Sure, ""it's adds a more challenging environment"" which teaches you to learn how to dodge these grappling attacks or in some cases block them. But when 5 of the same enemies ONLY uses those same grappling attacks, while you're having to fight of 10 normal enemies while also having to prepare to parry the normal enemies attacks at the same time... it's practically impossible to dodge them! Especially if you're literally surrounded by enemies in the form of a circle, then you really can't dodge at all. There's just way too much crap happening all at once to be able to multi-task different enemies and their attacks. Now if you could parry grappling attacks, for the exception of one specific unique enemy, then I actually wouldn't be ranting about grappling right now.Big Zombie Hulk - a mountain of musle that charges at you and tosses you around like a wet towel. I feel like this enemy needs to be improved upon just a tid-bit more. Sometimes this guy will charge at me and grab me when I'm a good couple of feet away from him. And when you're in a tight spot, the extra space you think you have to dodge safely, isn't safe at all. His auto-grab attack box/range needs to be worked on a bit. Left me in some really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off moments.Annoying level design. Some levels are annoyingly difficult, with enemies coming from all directions, absolutely pummeling you and ""grappling you""... and all you have is your fists, because you died in the same exact level you're getting rekt in at the moment. Losing your weapons when you die is a challenging and good concept, but some levels just aren't designed to support only your fists, because you died. Annoyingly difficult level + No weapons = Absolute mayhem. But not the good kind of mayhem, the annoying kind. This ain't Dark Souls hard, where you were bested by something that requires actual skill to kill... no this is annoyingly hard, where skill not just matters but your dang patience and mental stability is starting to fall apart, because something that isn't ""that hard"" is all the sudden stupid freaking hard for some annoying reason.In addition to some of these stupidly hard level designs, some of the checkpoints are really out of line. Having to fight all the way back to where you died sucks, that's fine. But when you have to do it several times because of bad level design, then that's a problem... challenging or not, it's a problem. This ain't Anor Londo 3.0 but in another universe. The game can be hard enough as it is sometimes, but when the difficulty jumps stupidly high because of bad level design, it doesn't become ""fun""... it becomes a frustrating, annoying grind!Sadly, I don't feel like this game's replay value is any good. I don't think I'll ever play it again, unless some cheaply priced dlc comes along or perhaps a multiplayer/coop feature hops in. Usually if you don't want to replay the game, there's something wrong with the game that bothers you. This is one of those games for me.So that's about it, seeing how this game has an 89% since the last time I checked, I'd imagine a Negative from me won't hardly do much to the rating. Maybe if the game received a few game changing patches, although I doubt it, then I might change my review. Again, if I could give this a ""Meh 50/50 Thumbs-Sideways"" rating then I would."

Very mindless and repetitive."

,Recommended,447290,34014861,Posted: 4 August,all,Ragnarøkkr,"A cool Top Down/Isometric style twinstick beat 'em up. Great find. Game looks fantastic, shadows and post-process seem to hit the frame rate pretty hard though. Difference between Shadows & Post-Process on Average rather than ultra can be upwards of 50 FPS. Average shadows leave an annoying pattern across the ground. The LAB/Prison chapters had my framerate chug to 45 - 50 FPS with shadows on ultra. Changing the Shadows in game in certain areas even dropped my FPS into the  20's. Putting them on LOW (with everything else maxed out) boosted my FPS to 120+. So there's DEFINITELY a problem with the shadows. Combos are fun, some of the finishers are brutal. For $15 ($12.74 on special) i can't nit-pick too much. Game plays 10x better with a controller for me. Not a fan of Mouse & Keyboard for twin-stick style games."

The fighting mechanics are quality, it reminded me of Mad Max fighting mechanics, but with a smash TV overtop camera view. The violence is good/satisfying.Some challenging scenes which made me battle. Gameplay is a little similar to Hotline Miami, but you can counter combat and execute. You need to utilise weapons based on a good mix of baddies, not as punishing as Miami though. (Hardcore setting maybe a mission)Some frame rate issues, but im confident Sobaka Studio can resolve this via patch release(s). They're a small team and should be proud of this game, I know they're monitoring the Redeemer Community Hub - Discussions and really listening to gamers.The price value is decent, I will definitely be watching the developer for future releases, it's deserving of a purchase, get involved people."

As far as top down action games go this is definitely one of the best I have played alongside the Hotline Miami games. Exhilarating action from start to finish, very addictive and easy to pick up and play.

,Not Recommended,447290,34061676,Posted: 6 August,all,dracolytch,"Simple and fun, the first few levels are great. However, as you get closer to the end of the game, instead of being intelligent or clever, the devs seem to just put harder monsters in with fewer save points. This is never more apparent than on level 14, in which you've somehow (not explained) ended up in a room with moving walls, without weapons, and have to fight wave after wave of mobs without a break or a save point. If you die, you have to start the level over from the beginning again. Needs better design."

No combos or special abilities. Just punch, kick and use all sorts of melee or ranged weapons. Every weapon that is used against you can be equipped and used as well. Downside: all of the weapons break down very quickly.The environment offers instant kill occasions, but each object can only be used once.Game length is roughly 6-7 hours if you don't die too often. The game is challenging in some parts, and later on requires alot of dodging around rooms and counter-attacking at the right moments. Or just spray and pray if you have a gun.There's are no skills to be learned, and no talent tree. Just an angry monk and whatever he can get his hands on."

Meele combat with Batman/Shadow of Mordor/Mad Max style, which is simple but damn good. Sure, it does not have a skill tree (which could have been included, for example: increased health bar, damage, more ammo), but I was enjoying the game. The only real downside is the veeery annoying difficulty gap around episode 6. It caused me some serious rage quits, mind you, I consider myself a good player. God have mercy on my soul when I will attempt to get the achievements for the hardcore difficulty or the no death level completions."

The better looking graphics and the brutal combat made it standout from the sea of other indies that flood the Steam marketplace. It offers great visuals with brutal gory combat that had me hooked from the very first slow motion punch.While there’s a good selection of combat options just with your melee weapons and guns, you also get to use your environment to your advantage and they are all beautifully gory as well. The game has a decent amount of varied environments, but the last 3/4 of it takes place in the corporation’s headquarters where they are manufacturing their cyborg soldiers. I would have liked there to be more levels outside like the first 1/4, but they’re varied enough and littered with enough unique environment finishers to keep things fresh.Redeemer was a bloody (literally) good time and a great addition to a genre that has been scarce lately. While there isn’t a huge combo list or a wide range of environments, it’s the wide selection of melee weapons, guns, and environment kills that keeps things fun and fresh throughout. It made me feel powerful and badass through the entire game and it’s truly a gem on Steam."

It's better to move slowly through the levels, even backtracking at points to pick-up the weapons you left behind.

76561198088752220,Recommended,447290,34788532,Posted: 6 September,all,Mike Oxlong,"Redeemer is what I would call a middling brawler with ambitions beyond its means, but at its best it's sort of like being able to play those Madness Combat flash movies from the earlier days of Newgrounds. Sadly, it isn't frequently at its best.I loved Mother Russia Bleeds, a realistic simulator of a day in the life of an average Russian fetal alcohol syndrome suffererer, to which this game bears some similarity in terms of environment and general technical progression. Mother Russia Bleeds used the resources available to it to create a unique and varied brawler experience, with enemies requiring various combinations of techniques to overcome and a unique atmosphere.While some of that can be seen in Redeemer, the additon of another dimension in combination with far more readily available firearms leads to a combat system which is exploitable and boringly easy if not set to hardcore. The copying of certain elements, mainly countering, from the Arkham games doesn't help anything. And instead of filling the shoes of a degenerate in a hoodie, this time you're a standard human enemy from Stalker who has given up his manhood and now lives in a colony of eunuchs and hands out pamphlets in airports.Redeemer is obviously more expensive than Mother Russia Bleeds and yet simultaneously comes off as emptier and cheaper. Sobaka wanted to make a Blood Dragon and manage to shoehorn in a few 80s action references, although most of them are in the glossary or the names of achievements. But it's evident massive cuts have been made and it feels very much like the budget offering it is. The bizarre, decadent, dingy, Eastern European environment of Mother Russia Bleeds is here replaced by a clean, literally comic book story and military resarch facilities which wouldn't have felt out of place in an older Resident Evil game.Still, the game looks good and runs basically without a hitch outside of a few sequences, and there's some pleasure to be found for a while in navigating its labyrinth of foes, combining techniques to take them down efficiently, which I understand is what Sobaka was striving to achieve. But it's short, there's virtually nothing to the plot or any of the characters, and you can practically see the scissor marks where the ending boss fight should have been. There's little to no replay value unless you want to find the hidden scrolls or do no-death runs of the stages, and it's honestly not worth the asking price.Redeemer is not a terrible game if you enjoy brawlers, even if the developers clearly overbudgeted for vodka when working out the financials and had to cut the game down, but wait for a discount, because you just aren't going to get much out of it. If you want dingy, bizarre, and Eastern European, play 'The Underground Man'.I'm kidding, don't."

The hits fly hard, and the ragdolls fly harder. While this isn't close to the same shelf space as a Platinum game or Streets of Fury, the top down perspective and all the design choices within give it a unique feel.Weapons are limited use, guns even more so. Environmental kills are basically free-instakills, you can throw barrels with just one button press-and-release. Enemies glow when attacking so you can guard, parry, or dodge them. Downside, the glow for unblockable/grapple attacks does not appear different enough from the parry attack glow, but I would hold that harder against a more technical game. This game is more satisfying than technical, and I can excuse some of the jank.Just a fair warning, I peeked ahead on youtube and the final boss seemed a goofy incomprehensible gauntlet so if you were hoping for top-down Armstrong as the final boss, I think you'll be disappointed. I have not got that far myself. I fear that the jank might overcome the quality in the usual ways later on, with checkpoint issues and cheesy new enemies, but I have seen no such trouble as of yet.Still, I'm already happy with the money I spent just for the sheer feel of beating dudes in this game. It REALLY nails the exaggerated power of a charge-up falcon punch."

,Not Recommended,447290,34224883,Posted: 13 August,all,SenatorIvy,"Years ago there was a badass game called Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks.  When I saw the preview video for this it looked similar.  The graphics are good, but the combat just isn't there in a lasting way.I'm about halfway through the game in 1 sitting and I'm not exactly drawn into the story, nor am I wowed by the combat.  There seems to be 1 combo of punches, 1 combo of kicks, and then charge attacks on both.  Enemies are basically identical, with the only difference being how many times you have to hit them with the combo to kill them.The guns are decently satisfying, but overall the game just leaves a mediocre taste in your mouth.  Don't know the exact story, can't be bothered to care. No progression combatwise.

It looks/sounds great with really fun combat.Only cons so far:1) Drop in FPS when lots of enemies fighting within view at the same time2) Checkpoints feel a bit inconsistent in how they're spaced out between levels3) Enemy variety seems a bit low so farUpdate:The framerate issue has become very annoying. On one particular level during a session, it dropped so ridiculously low that it was impossible to beat the level."

,Not Recommended,447290,34801655,Posted: 7 September,all,Ténia-Garou,"Pretty bland as far as top down action games go. Doesn't have the thing that would make it shine, pretty boring altogether. The combos, if you acknowledge they actually exist because I don't, are as simple as possible and don't really make a difference anyway and the actual fighting feels oh so slow. Weapons don't really have an identity, I don't feel the difference when I'm hitting someone with a machete or a tonfa or a battleaxe. Guns have different sounds and do more or less damage, obviously, but that's as much variation as you'll get.The game does look good to an extent, even though the protagonist looks like he shoved a .50BMG rifle up his♥♥♥♥♥ but nothing spectacular. Storywise, well I guess that's not what we ask this game so pretty much ignore it.That's a thumbs down and a refund for me, but I encourage you to buy it and give it a try, even if you refund it afterwards, because it isn't a *bad* game, it's just nothing particular really."

Enemy takedowns are easy against the player. Kilils are supposed to replenish health, but at a trickle. The second level feels impossible to pass and ends up being a confusing game of button mashing without any ability to use tactics to even the odds. Avoid this game. There is a reason it is cheap."

The thing that ruins this game for me in the control system. You have to use your mouse in conjunction with a poorly setup ASWD. This game does not seem like it was developed to be used with a mouse and keyboard. If anything I would not suggest this game unless you have a controller or playing will just suck. While I am sure the devs are still working on it, there is not much in the way of goals for the game. Just a simple kill or be killed arcade game, except once you die, you die. There is no scoring system beyond how far you can get. I personally would not suggest this game, but then again I don't own a controller. Out of 100.. this game gets a solid 50/50 for effort."

,Recommended,447290,34034851,Posted: 5 August,all,martinchrisa,"Pros: It's easy to pick up and play this, controls are straight forward- but there is a learning curve for some of the advanced moves. It eases you into it as you progress, learning a new move every few minutes/levels. The hand to hand combat is ala Batman Arkham- I will say, when you press counter, it seems like I'm way faster than it wants me to be. It's not forgiving at all if you mis-time it. The gunplay reminds me of those Halo top down games(or any other game like this). Probably impossible to play without a gamepad. All in all, really quite a fun experience. The graphics are good- but I will say it seems a bit un-optomized yet, i notice significant frame rate drops in heavy areas. Running i7 + 1060 6gb.Cons: It's pretty difficult at times, with that bit of framerate drop, and the counter move seems delayed. I got used to it, but it just doesn't feel natural to me.Overall: Definitely worth $15. A patch or two down the road this thing will be amazing instead of just great."

Even dying a few times in a row does not frustrate.The stealth, execution & environment kill animations are both brutal & funny.If your a fan of brawler style games this is a must have.

Best free-roaming(ish) brawler I've seen since Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks.It's like Gauntlet, Smash TV and Alien Storm had a mutant baby.  Learning to use the charge attack properly is key.  The game mechanic is great - you have infinite energy, but the full-power takes just a second to build up.  That's a second you don't always have.The one thing I would like to see is some sort of indicator on the waepon pickup as to whether or not it's better than the one you have.Huge amounts of fun."

In spite of its flaws I would recommend it to any one who is a fan of these kind of games.Cons: Redeemer has a few graphical issues, frame rate stuttered every now and again, and your character can clip through objects and enemies at times. This was never a huge issue, though I did have to load a checkpoint once when I got stuck in the environment. Also I did run into a few hit detection issues where I felt that I unfairly took damage, this could have been user error. . . but figured I would mention it.Pros: The combat is fun, while i never found the combo system (basically just alternating the punch and kick buttons) that rewarding, the combination of punching, kicking, charge attacks, melee weapons, guns, finishing moves, and environmental kills were more than enough to keep me entertained for the entire campaign. The game has good enemy and environmental variety that kept things fresh throughout. Most importantly I found Redeemer incredibly addicting, often thinking, ""well getting to one more checkpoint couldn't hurt"".Overall a great game well worth the price."
