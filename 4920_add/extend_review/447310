,Not Recommended,447310,23211365,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,BritishRail60062,"I am telling the truth here for this game from my point of view. At first impressions, the game is fun and enjoyable to play and the crashes are hilarious for a while, but then that is where the positive part of this game ends. As after that point this game becomes more of a frustrating chore than a fun game for the casual gamer. I don't care if this review gets voted down as the truth is not always nice. If you have a high tolerence of patience, then sure buy the game. But for the casual gamer, I would recommend something less frustrating. A difficulty mode would have been nice :).Overall Rating: 3/10."
76561198140299850,Recommended,447310,21653779,"Posted: 5 March, 2016",all,foofaraw,"EDIT: Having passed Level 100, I can only say PT:T continues to exceed expectations; constantly challenging w/o becoming tedious. I do not hesitate to call the overall design and concept ""brilliant"", and far exceeding the average.Paper Train: Traffic is a very special game. Special in its simplicity, in its design and concept, in its wonderful anything-but-simply graphics (though simple to understand), and special in the joy of playing such a FUN game. (Oh, yes, VERY special in its wonderfully low price.)The premise to Paper Train: Traffic is nothing new, so the learning curve isn't even an issue (except for helping to develop skills.) You have a number of trains crossing the screen. Pretty much all the player can do is stop, then start traffic on specific tracks to avoid collisions (which are quite fun, and not necessarily rage-inducing), or switch tracks on some levels. (Perhaps other things later on.) There are variables to consider, such as trains are of different lengths and travel at varying speeds, f'rinstance. (And did I mention that the trains aren't always the same in every attempt.....) Some of the tracks are very convoluted, and involve many crossings. You are also able to ""boost"" the speed of the entire screen in order to increase points generated, but then aren't close to the ""stop/start"" buttons. Any collisions results in a ""Retry"", while a level completion results in a grade of 1 - 3 stars. As in most games of this type, cummulative star count opens features, and each of 300(!!!) levels must be accessed through completion of prior levels. There is also at least one leaderboard with the option to compare to friends only (and perhaps other choices.)I haven't played Paper Train: Traffic very long, but I really don't need to to recommend it at this price. My suggestion? Buy it, play it, decide for yourself within the ""refund"" period. I suspect there will be few refunds requested.(Hopefully more as I have more to report.)Thank you."

Beautiful graphics, and relatively simple UI. But the randomized nature of the level becomes really agonizing in the later levels. There is no way to learn the flow of each level, instead, everything is purely based on reflexes and good observation skill. Which is probably want the designer intended it to be!But the biggest problem turned out to be the way to handle multiple stop buttons. The mouse is just not particularly effective when you have to quickly click small rectangles around the screen. This probably works way better on touch screen than with a mouse. When you fail almost completed level just because you misclicked a small button, it really gets to you...To emphasize: This is NOT a logistics puzzle game, this is a twitch kind of action game. Take it as such, and you probably will have better time than I did.I would give it a ""meh"", but because it is not possible, unfortunately I cannot recommend the game :("

Would've enjoyed either a longer timer or wait for button-press so that I could watch the rest of the trains crash too :).I like trains!"

However, running the trains at high speed to get more points and stars can be incredibly challenging in the time given.  With that said, this game is very fun, and I have nothing negative to write about it.  The game is simple, challenging, and addictive.  Highly recommended..."

Even when you fail a level the frustration is eased by the resultant train crash.I've finished all the levels (300) in about 18 hours. But the addiction is there just to keep going back and replay the levels for those extra points, and just for the joy of the gameplay.At this price I can only recommend you give it a try. The graphics are worthy of any full price game and the gameplay is a joy."

In what I can only assume was an attempt to increase the playtime for the game (why bother, there are 300 levels), the timing of the trains on a level is somewhat random. So you can't steadily refine your skill on a level because what works for one attempt doesn't work for the next, or the next...So the game isn't worth even a couple of dollars."

,Recommended,447310,25637260,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,arvan24,"Paper Trains is a wonderfully simple yet challenging game to play. I have never written a review before this one but felt complled to leave my thoughts as this is one of the best bangs for your buck I have ever come across.I love playing small, cheap, indie games and this one tops them all. For a little over $2 you get a game that has simple yet captivating visuals, some humor (exploding cows) a TON of levels (which I did not expect from a game at this cost) and a real challenge to play.The one thing I specifically like abou the gameplay which others have complained about is that when you reset a level, the puzzle does not come back the same as it was before. The trains come out at different times and different lengths and you cannot just make fixes to what you did before and 'cheat the system' per se. Makes it a real challenge to get three stars even on the simplest levels!I HIGHLY recomend getting this game."

The music is OK.But, and that's my reason for not recommending it, it is really frustrating, especially if you aim for 3 stars. Sometimes the trains appear in a way a solution is not possible, sometimes you are just not fast enough for handling signals that are some way apart. In these cases you have to train a bit to utilize the boost to the best advantage, i.e. stop using it in the right moment.If you have a high frustation level, go ahead, it's a good game then."

,Recommended,447310,31215660,Posted: 18 April,all,Bazinga!,"I played it on mobile as a free version with not all features and recently bought it on steam.You can get to Level 50 in 1 hour if you dont care much about the stars.It is true that sometimes the levels are non-deterministic. For example Level 47 I tried 8 times before at time 9 I got a good combination of trains.And to get 3 Stars you have to play some levels at full speed (holding space bar) which is really difficult... buts thats 3 Stars right? And in fact a little bit of randomnes is fine for me.Game mechanics work fine.I very like the blueprint/hand-drawn grafix and that it is playable in windowed mode.I am missing a level editor connected to the steam workshop and a ""slow motion"" button."

Espically the harder last levels. Achievements are easy for the game, with 300 levels. The achievement for 500 stars is easily done and the other achievements are for each 50 levels done.I highly recommend this game and playing it with a podcast or music in the background"

It's just like a hundred of mobile games about airports and parcing lots. BUT. I absolutelly love the graphic style. THE GRAPHIC STYLE. I love it so much and I can't do anything about this love. These drawings... Firstly, they are kinda nostaglic. And, secondly, they are much more better performed than my childish drawings on the desk when I was a little piece of kid. So yeah, I recommend it. Just because of graphics."
