So this makes it now THREE games and one of those games was re-branded as a ""new"" game? If you want to include War. Inc, then that makes it FOUR games. ALL of which were abandoned after taking players cash.Just spreading awareness so no one buys this without knowing which company they are purchasing it from and their murky  con♥♥♥♥♥past.The game offers absolutely nothing new, its a embelished reskin with no playing features, And utterly unworth the £20 entry fee to play it. It does however give the IMPRESSION  that they plan to deliver a complete finished game with the ""future content"" and ""Monthly updates""Do NOT be fooled. This is all promise and talk we have heard before. Its fair to say that this game will be dead in a matter of months with no new content.I quote the master of tricks himself,""Shattered Skies is a survival looter shooter, with graphics, gameplay, features that are ""2016"" :). Yet it will be familiar to WarZ players. -Sergey Titov      LULZIts all the same Devs behind WarZ, meaning they WILL ♥♥♥♥ you over. I'll pass putting anymore hours into this.Do not trust ANYONE related to Sergey Tortov at all. Yet he still managed to sneak back in and fool us all again and again. Its kind of comical how i keep letting them butt♥♥♥♥ me like this.Payhacks are available and currently being used in game by a large majority of the playerbase. As proven by the countless payhacker streams. So much for the new concrete anti cheat...Pick something else for a safer playing experience. And dont get ripped off like me again"

Don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy this. The devs scammed people out of more money. They aren't going to fix anything else. They're moving on to the next scam.They're adding garbage skins and cosmetics to make money instead of fixing hit register, hit boxes, damage model, etc. There are HUGE PvP problems that they just do not address.If you hear the name Hammerpoint, OP Productions, Stellar Stone, Sergey Titov, Artemis, or ""MLG anticheat"" run far away from that product. All of these names are involved with each other and will continue to scam gamers out of money. DO. NOT. BUY.Sergey Titov is the biggest scammer in the industry. If you want to to know what other games he worked on... look up 'Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.' 8/100 on Metacritic. This is who you're dealing with.Edit: Oh look there's more! New game by different company still involved with Sergey Titov called Last Man Standing! AND IT LOOKS AND PLAYS JUST LIKE SHATTERED SKIES!"

If you simply want to purchase it, use the lowest dollar amount you can.Pros:-Good foundation PVP with suprise PVE (see cons for more clarification.-Lots of Looting, Time Wasting.Cons:-Aliens are dropped on top of you literally cause the code is incomplete, If you enter any type of loting area you have an 80% chance that the second you enter an alien will immidately spawn within .5 Meteres from you and begin attacking you at 20HP A hit killing you very quickly, Any type of juking will have the alien launch plasma blasts that do 40 damage and ahve an AOE effect. Whats worse is that these aliens are EXTREMELY tough and have no skill curve, So even the begining level 5 aliens take 150+ Hollowpoints to Kill, 40+ FMJ, and 30+ AP. But what you need to know is that players will simply use the aliens as a means to track you because the NPC's will constantly follow you until death or you reach a magical NO NPC ZONE around each city. Killing an alien does not offer you a breather and sometimes after you barely survive one another simply spawns in its place repeating the process.-PVP Events, there are only two events. A Reactor event which is basically king of the hill, and supply drop which is bait and tag. Cancerous gameplay is promoted and by no means teamwork is a definate sign that you can win, Some larger clans will jump into a random low population server with 4-6 Premade teams and just roam around to kill all day. For a solo player this is impossible to do.-Cosmetics only apply for personal looks only, and wepon cosmetics only can be used after getting the third tier of weapon if you can even manage that long to keep it. Meaning money or time spent getting weapon skins is nothing if you cannot find a light blue weapon.-Memory leaks, I have 16GB of ram and the game at its lowest setting uses 14.5 GB of RAM. This has not been fixed since beta and its release.-Crashes, Expect your experience to be ruined by a random crash now and then and your still body shot up and♥♥♥♥♥♥stolen.-Administration, there is none.-Anticheat, There is none except for a 'custom' anti cheat that they coded which has been circumvented by many popular cheat sites.-Community, Any assistance that you attempt to ask for will only reply with the phrase 'getgud'as of this point DO NOT BUY THIS GAME it is another WARZ failure money grab."

,Not Recommended,447500,24504533,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,Ladiesman,"//UPDATE// I just found out this game is made by Sergey Titov developer behind the WarZ scandal, etc. So I'm currently requesting a refund. I'll leave my origional thoughts below so you can make your own decision, but I'd seriously consider supporting this developer with such a bad history.I love the core concept here, just gonna bullet point my thoughts.Pros:-Loot system works great, refreshes quickly-Designed around playing with friends easily in a sandbox environment-Weapon modification system is cool and intuitive-Alien spawning mechanic is interesting and unpredictable-Not always easy to spot players due to no persisting name plates, icons, etc-No P2W or sleezy cash shop itemsCons:-Progression system sucks and needs to be rebuilt, high level players have a significant advantage over new players, regardless of what gear they find since better weapons have level restrictions. This is very counterintuitive to ""sandbox"" type gameplay and needs to be fixed. ""adding"" newbie servers is stupid.-Atmospherics need work, wind, animals, weather, etc. World feels very dead at the moment.-Map needs to be bigger, with explorable areas that aren't exactly charted out to be found so easily.-Crafting system needs fixed, level 20's shouldn't be able to craft armor that makes them near invincible to starting weapons.-Map loadin takes longer than DayZ.....-Need interactable structures, you can't even close doors right now... seems stupid.-Factions need fleshed out, as well as the vendors, absolutely no context as to their purpose at the moment-Aliens need to be fleshed out, pose a real threat... random events, invasions, attack/defend scenarios, etcSummary:The core concept to this game is great, but the progression system needs an overhaul, as high level players are at a significant advantage to lower level players that cannot be countered with skill. That normally would be okay, but in a sandbox dayz type game, balance is everything. Just adding ""newbie"" servers is stupid and completely negates the core concept of a sandbox type game.The alien and faction setup needs fleshed out and refined, there's a huge opportunity here to have some faction warfare, or have the aliens pose a fun and significant threat so players have something else to do than just grief each other.Overall, this game feels like early access, and should be labeled as such. If this is the ""finished"" product then i'm sad, and you shouldn't waste your time or money here. A few key changes and this game will get a positive vote from me."

Thought you would be able to create a lot of stuff in the game that was worth wild. im sorry but that is not the case. Yes I know that this is a PVP game. But its such a small world and the aiming is wack. So its more like leave base dead and you lose everything. Getting materials to make stuff is a joke. There are a lot of other games on the market that you can craft and this one is a joke. Serious people this game took me for a loop. You pick up crates with stuff in them and some space rocks. Then you go to a town and trade them for coins then you can buy gear and you half to get a lot of crates and space junk. I played the game for 35 hours. you would think that is a lot but its not. that was just to get to lvl 15. I was dead half the time from PVP. Sometimes i would be shooting people in the face with a shotgun and they would say i never shot the.. No its not my network. Either way. Save your money the game is not wha you think.I tryed to get a refund and they said no... Cause i went over my 2 hours of play. lol 2 hours realy. You cant do anything in 2 hours. I gave it a nice 35 just to find out it sucked just as much at 35 as it did when it booted up. Yeah boot takes like 15 min..... Well it felt that way.     Just take my word this game is not good at all..... But its your money

If you have friends that play and you like to grief it could be alright.

Graphics are decent, (7/10)5. PVP system improved alot from the previous titles6. You can kill a lvl 50 if you aren´t a complete potato in FPS games, but don´t expect going 1v4 and killing everyone that may happen or may not happen it depends on how you use the environment to your advantage7. Aliens are pretty well made and in my opinion they should be even more agressive than they are right now ( i know they are focusing on PVP and not PVE so i guess its ok)8. The loot is well balanced9. If you die it isn´t that punishing because you can regear yourself in about 5 minutes, i guess the purpouse of the game is to have fun and i think developers think the same10. There should be more customizations to your character and i mean when you start the game for the first time, theres some faces you can choose and some hairs but there should be more varieties of each, i couldn´t even change my clothes but from what i have read, you can get them from boxes wich are free in the game which is fine11.

They spent too much time on this update and it is bad really bad. They changed all the names of guns (mercenar-mk3...this is pointless), they added factions and it says that you can't kill your faction members but you can and you don't know when you are able to kill them and when you aren't. Everything is so rare now if you find elite ms4 it is almost like legendary before the update. Pistols have 30 or even 40 more dmg than riflesWTFFFFF?????It is easier to kill someone on 60m with a pistol than with a rifle. HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?Update ruined the game. Our inventories are empty and people with duplicated guns got rewards for them, the creators just lied that they know who was duplicating the guns(they don't even know how to fix all the glitches how can they know who was duplicating??). The things that are fixed now: aliens aren't dancing anymore, trees are a bit less glitched and that's all.They said fps will be better but nothing changed (I still have 60 fps on ultra on gtx970). The game was better before the update, they could just fix the glitches and the game would be better than it is now. I don't recomend buying this game because of all things that are listed above. There are 5 EU servers for 80 players and there are 20 players on a server this means that you can't  find anyone or you get killed by 7 players team. The game will be dead soon, number of players is decreasing each day. They didn't even make player counter on community hub because the number of players would be three digit...TNX CREATORS FOR MAKING THIS GAME SO BAD WITH THIS UPDATE.

This game seemed pretty cool from the trailer and several reviews, but the rank disparity and trolling turds just suck the fun out of it.   I get that there are Novice servers being deployed soon, however the game is clearly unfinished and full of somehow maxxed out players only weeks into the launch.   While there appear to be no microtransactions as yet, the first sign of trouble (I know, I should have seen it) was the 'How gud do u want to be?' automatic level buy in.   So, if you have $80 to blow, this game might be fun, but for those wanting to check out the game for $20 prepare to be killed, repeatedly and have all of your stuff taken, repeatedly.  You will even blow through the five Welcome Bags you get up front,  for as you spawn in after dieing there will be aliens and you will need weapons, until the L30+ dudes find you and kill you for your mango can of whatever.  That's one thing I haven't figured out, do the leveled players kill the L1-5 for sport?

Maybe you will remember the reviews I quote.TLDR:It is pay to win.Have fun dying lots.Horrible AI.War Z develpors.Oh and no survival.Best feature is making your case to valve for refund. -_-Now, positive reviews say that the game is not ""pay to win""Oh boy, this is true that there are no micro transactions for guns/ammos. BUT! You can buy a higher tier of the game for XP. What the ♥♥♥♥ is XP so important? Because without it, you can't use any of the guns you will find. You will litterely run with the same 3-4 weapons for tens of hours I bet. You pay more, get XP, meaning higher level and have a much easier time killing people and gearing up because people will have♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to you.Another comment in reviews are that you can kill a level 30-50 with skill. This is true to an extent, the level 30-50's will have better gear, kill you easier with little to no ease, and oh, yeah your gun is comeplete♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can in theory kill one, but their weapons, will be useless to you. YOU CAN'T USE THEM REMEMBER?! ^^^ There weapons are to high for you to use. GJSolo players will have fun. This one is that you will die hundreads of time before reaching level 10. With easy really. I love to play pvp games, especially fps, but this game is horrible in the sense of solo playing, many people have gank squads that are usually allways high level and pay to win. I had more fun talking to myself walking around then dying than playing the actual game. Not talking to other people, no, myself.Popular reviews you will say have said "" This game is good and it will be my go to survival game, sorry H1Z1! "" . There is no survival aspect to this game. Its a giant gun game. The food and water?! what? if you didnt buy the 35$-80$ version, *cough * paying to win versions *cough* then you don't have to worry about that since you will die lots, and lots, from people and almost never due to exclusively to the aliens. If you do buy the pay to win versions, the food and water is easy to find and the crafting is never used at all. It is a giant gun game.If you see Tac dominators review... it talks nothing but a respawning issue, and that they give updates and he didnt buy War Z. Yet he gave it a 7/10 and a positive rating... -_-?Kay is a used that gave a postive review and says he ""With over 300 hours played since the start of Beta I can say that this game does not take kindly to the weak or unexperienced. "" The weak or unexperienced?! This game isn't the first of its class and won't be the last. It doesn't take kindly, ♥♥♥♥ing Sasha Grey getting ♥♥♥♥ed by 5 black guys has it better than you. He also says  ""If you are a new player do not let lvl or the weapon they are using as a excuse to dieing."" He is right, it isn't an excuse, it is the reason you are dying. At an even playing feel, you could win or not win. Even with a small-medium disadvantage you can win, for example a gun difference. But when the difference is larger than opra's thighs! Then we have a problem, the level and weapons are in par with each other. High levels means better weapons and you can't even use them at all if you managed to kill a level 30-50.Is the game worth the 25 or the 22.50 im being asked for right now>? No... I would rather go buy myself bleach. Lots of it.The others... sure.... if you want to waste money. No I don't think this game is worth the 22.50 or 25 are regular price.

Maybe with more features it'll be worth my time, but I was pretty bored the entire gameplay experience.Right now this is DayZ with more loot, plus aliens. You're supposed to get XP by doing missions and killing aliens, but all the missions are locked up for an hour (since someone else recently did them, I suppose) and the aliens take all your ammo to kill, and give very very little XP. You can also get XP from crafting, but there are VERY few recipes open to a new player. I can only craft so many campfires.The ""noob server"" map is empty as heck. People said the more advanced servers are more populated. Great -- I get to wander around wasting ammo on OP aliens so I can very very slowly gain XP needed to play on better servers?No thanks.

Fighting system seems broken, too many ammo types that do nothing, aliens that are little more than an annoyance.  Absolutely no background or actually story or depth to the game.  This game isn't even a survival game so don't buy it if that is what you are looking for.  You drop more items on death in runescape than you do this.  Legendary weaps? don't drop them.  Loot from crates, or boxes, or bags? don't drop it.  A survival game where you don't even starve to death when you run out of food and water is not a survival game, its got so many training wheel mechanics it seems more like a tutorial for a survival game.  Either spend the whole time scavenging for parts to get cosmetic changes (which you are limited on if you don't spend more money on the expensive version of the game) or get railed by a less than subpar combat system.

So.... I came into this game with 0 butt hurt.That being said, They cleaned house before this game.  They hired a competent programmer who was well known in the community. This game is not perfect, there are deffinitly bugs. But, on launch, It has a shooting system that feels snappy, Covering means something, tactics and item usage timing are important.To address the salt over beta players being ahead, WAAAAAAH. Guess what, last night, I shot a level 38 in his head with a 12 guage slug. Guess what happened. He died, when he came back. Guess what, He was not good. So i wrecked him again. It aint that bad people. Yes, sometimes you get demolished by a level 50. Sucks. But its not unfair.Bottom line : Sorry you hated the last few games, But should that make you so jaded you swear off a studios games forever? Was a 25 dollar free DLC for forseeable future to much? And if the studio is sooooooo terrible and evil.... why did you buy it? Move along. Its a good game being ravaged by butthurtz from Warz.

At first, I was a little turned off by the graphcis. There is some pop-in issues with trees/bushes specifically (I am on a 980Ti, i5-6600k, 16GB RAM, SSD). But once you start playing the game- it is great.First off, it really doesn't matter if people are already lvl 50 and geared out. Gear is not permanent. Sure, they may have things stockpiled but YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN WIN WITH SUPERIOR TACTICS.I am lvl 10. I just killed a lvl 39 and a lvl 50 team while I was solo. I picked my battle, use cover, and ended up beat them both. HEADSHOTS ARE KING. Want to do damage? Aim for the head.Just don't get greedy like me. I looted some nice stuff that I was going to put in my vault and share with my buddy later... and I heard a silenced weapon firing close by. Snuck up behind the shooter who was on the top floor of a building... and there were 3 of them. Without a grenade, I tried to slowly back out... but I was spotted. I tried to run. Didn't work out.Choose your ammo type carefully! I don't know if this is true, but it has been for me. For Aliens, use AP rounds. For Players, use HP rounds. For both, use FMJ rounds. The damage difference felt noticeable to me. Placebo maybe? Not sure.Looking for attachments, upgrades, weapons, etc is fun. The fact that you can kill someone and take theirs makes it even better.I've played my fair share of H1Z1: KoTK and DayZ. This does feel similiar despite what the developer says. I would say if you blended the two, this is what you get. A persistent loot game that has crate drops, etc. Except it also has RPG elements with factions, weapon rarity, customizations etc.Also- no microtransactions. Seriously. All of the masks, hats, shirts, pants, shoes, etc? All earned in game. You can find them in packages obtained by doing ingame faction events (that other players will be competing against you for). Who knows how much I've spent on ridiculous H1Z1 keys, crates, etc. This is much better model.This is a fun game and I hope the developers continue to improve the performance, graphics, and drop the promised free DLC/Expansions.P.S. Play in a group. Will make it much easier to survive. Even a 2-man team is much better."

Little to no sound when player is not moving; the ambient sound is never constant and even when moving, is sometimes choppy.2. After a while of not moving with no sound playing at all, my PC seems to think at that point that the game has NO audio and the game from that point(unless I restart the game or sometimes the PC or put it to sleep and back)resumes with audio off even though in every setting it was on.3. The sounds your character produces are very repetitive which is normal right? But literall both sprinting and normal walking/jogging have the same sound effect.-SK only Bugs:1. Sometimes can't move items from the global chest into my inventory but can move new items into said chest just fine.2. Movement animations seem a bit unfinnished for ex. If you jump in place your character looks like they are holding invisible assault rifles, and while moving if you jump the end animation is on a bit longer than it should be.3. Default Voice output option sends to my monitor and/or speakers instead of what I have specified in my PC's sound options.4. Tree's are laggy as hell; I can max out this game just fine minus terrain detail but if i put tree's on high my fps drops to around 2. With tree's on low I jump up to 100+.5. Playing this game without friends and/or groups is a nightmare. Possible, but it's a nightmare.These are currently the only issues I have with the game."

The graphics are not bad but still that does not make up for the lack luster content and unfair gameplay. When I first started I tried to bump up the graphics and it crashed four times. When       I did get it to work i was greeted by people trying to kill everyone and the global bank. After that I went to the nearist town and got killed by a level fifty that I was behind and I pumped 30 bullets into his head and he turns around and kills me. DON'T GET THIS GAME. It's a broken piece of filth. If they cared about making a good game and not a cash grab this game would be a decent game but it's all for the money. 0/10"

The graphics are alright, could be much better, but what really got me were the gun animations and sound effects. The animations are nothing more than the slides racking and the gunshots sound like they're 100 feet away. The animations for everything are just bad. Within 20 minutes I found 3 AK's, 2 Spas 12's, and an M4 on top of the M4 and pistol you get for starting the game. Crafting doesn't look to be anything beyond bandages and campfires, i.e. no base building (at least not in the crafting menu).Honestly what this game feels like is a quick cash grab trying to muscle in on Escape From Tarkov, which looks infinitely better. Go look into that game instead."

Shattered Skies in my opinion is a great game I'm not one to follow the hate train when it comes to the other ""related games"" that ""this Company"" developed (Having played the others my only issue with them was unlike Shattered Skies your camera couldn't pan downwards only up to a certain point with Aftermath (unless that was a bug T_T) About in-game purchases You really aren't disadvantaged when it comes to your ""Account Level"" for example mine is the Starter edition I get the loot bags every Shattered Skies player gets right from the start i have 150 or so Global Vault slots to bank items found throughout the world and as far as the extra experiance you get if you want to level that fast i guess its worth the higher editions but i like the good ol grind to get the most out of this game.The content drop that happened recently was a nice adition we got some new weapons which look cool.Now for a few points id like to lean on.First off people think that the higher level you are the harder you are to kill that is somewhat true but also far from the truth i have killed before the update to seperate the level caps of 0-15 and 16-40 quite my fair share of level 40s with a starter level one weapon such as one of my favorite guns so far the Ak12s.ArmorYES there is armor YES it does reduce damage but when it comes to pvp i hardly notice it actually helping. I have had high teir armor and it feels usless agiasnt players at times however agiasnt Aliens i feel safe and cozy wearing Reactor armor.Now for somethings that i hope to see later on down the roadCurrently the Aliens are quite scary at times they have jump scared me or given away my position at the worst of times (i cri everytime) But ive noticed you can ""juke"" the Aliens you are able to make them freeze on the spot and if you get the right angle you can pick them off with your gun easily such as stairs or behind crate clusters.About KoS/Pvp/PvEYes people do troll its a shame really I've met some amazing players I owe a high level player many thanks for teaming up with me to Two-man the reactor it went really well we had to kill a group of 4 which was a shame we wanted to be peaceful. (if you ever read this Thanks again man you were a great help) You get people in large groups, - Don't be mad about that. Make friends, Acquaintances and team up with randoms if you die don't get upset you'll find loot everywhere if you look hard enough.PvP is fast pacedPVP in close quaters is hard work and it is indeed stressful (some would say a 1v1 face to face fight is more honorable) which i agree with but i don't see that happening in a game like this I really like cross city fights in the roof tops and alleys in Misty Shattred Skies ""Capital City"" i would call it there's nothing better than watching two groups fight it out from a window.PVEEarning reputation for the three factions can be a fun but slow grind taking airdrops, Blockades and Satalite towers. Blockades earns you  Dominion rep, Towers earn you Merchant rep.The Reactor is high risk high reward every 2 hours and 30 minutes you and a ""GROUP"" member are able to fend off aliens while you loot the reactor. In this location you can find lots of materials and the most important Legendary gun parts throughout the site Aleins seem to spawn every 30 seconds to 1 minute. So make sure to bring ammo reserves and medical supplies before heading thier and do expect other players do be doing the same."

Even though  the game has only been out on steam a little while now, there are already maxed out players with top level gear running around killing you every where you go. I respawn in some random place and before I get a new weapon to defend myself I'm killed again by yet another maxed out player with top level gear. I respawn again and go through it all again and again for as long as I can take it before leaving the game. I'll try again a few hours later with the same result. Even if I manage to shoot the maxed out player many times first it doesnt help, with their top level gear I cant  do any real damage before they shoot and kill me. Also many of the high level characters seem to know right where I'm at, even if I'm some place they couldn't possible have seen me. I'll be crouched behind a desk on the third floor of a building and peeking out a window over looking a street. A maxed out player runs down the street, runs straight into my building and a split second later is shooting me from behind. They didnt have to look for me, they knew right where i was, which has happened several times in just a couple of days. Some higher level characters either have something that lets them know right where you are or they are using cheat codes, or both. This is like many games out already where the guys with really maxed out characters get to have tons of fun killing the low level noobies over and over before the new guys get a chance to even get started. Lots of fun for the maxed out idiots who think this makes them really good at the game, and totally frustrating and impossible for the new players.

I spend all my time looking for food and water but their are tons of ammo spawns. The inventroy screen covers everything, so players can easily kill you cuz you cannot see the live game screen if you are using it. You definitely need a group of players you know to play with you. A vast majority of the players level 15+ will kill you on sight and laugh about it even if you are level 1 and have no defense. In 19.5 hours of playing i found ONE player out of a safe zone that didn't fire at me and grouped. I found ONE at a safe zone that grouped to help me out and explain a few things. Other than that all others were agressive. You can't build a camp, there are no vehicles and the map is small for 70 players. I say that because you will run into others quite a bit and if they see you.. you will die.... because the loot objectives have a long lockout timer and the higher level players run a cycle that can hit most of them before their first one re-spawns.. which leaves nothing for the lower level players. Thus they cannot advance.A total waste of time unless you got into this game early and have already advanced.. or you have a couple friends to group with. Otherwise save your money."

It is also really random with alien attacks as they are not just scattered around but instead are spawned on top of you quite a lot of the time which in my opinion keeps you on your toes if you do not have any ammo/weapons.Overall a good game but best to play with friends or in a group."

After running around getting everything i could find and dying a lot, i started to learn more about the game and the mechanics and how to actually play the game. I think that is the biggest learning curve for people to understand. There isnt to much info and it doesnt show you much of what there is to do, its all up to you to find out, which is not a bad thing, i think too many people are caught up in being told what to do right from the start. Yes the game is not perfect, but no game ever is. After a few hours of playing the game i do find myself enjoying it a lot, I suck at killing people in this game but ill get better the more i play. Just give it a try before you completly write it off. With more updates and patches it will only get better. I do not believe there is a pay to win aspect in the game, only slight benifits of weapon attachtments, skins, clothes, XP and the use of higher tier weapons. Out of all of that, XP and higher tier weapons are the biggest changers, anything else like weapon attachements which upgrade guns stats can all be had if you hit up excavation sites for crystal and ore and collection material parts that are literally all over the place, The reason you cannot kill lvl 50 players is because of the hours they have put into the game.

Its the same 5 things over and over.1. Run Simulator2. Die to a player who has much better loot than you3. Fight a single alien with such terrible AI, it makes every fight dull and boring. ( even your first one )4. Organizing loot. ( Why does the global system have to be 4 columns? It makes it feel very tight, and it takes forever to scroll through everything. ) looting isn't even fun, every type of loot feels the same.5. Holding E to repair something for 10-60 seconds at a time. You only do this 5 times in a row once every 2-3 hours or so.I honestly can't recommend this game.

76561197989893924,Recommended,447500,24512171,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,Propaganda,"I can see why this game has mixed reviews it shines in some areas and is just meh in others.Maybe the best review I can write is to give you my thoughts on my first 20ish hours of play.I bought the starter addition (20$ or whatever) and started as level 1 with nothing. First impressions were really good. Running from ailens, trying to find some guns - doing what I could to surive. Shot at some people, died, respawned and tried again. I'll even admit that I got pretty frustrated with the level 30's-50's killing me super fast as most people do.This is a PvP game. You have to fight. You will die. Don't buy if you don't want people murdering you on sight. This game is shoot first ask questions later... later as in after you have rummaged through all their stuff of course.The higher levels DO have an advantage. Regardless of whatever else you read. Some dude who looks like a badass storm trooper with a mega rifle will insta burn you. If you expected something else.... well it's not here.That being said. I have (three or four times total) killed someone who was level 30+ by sneaking up on them with a shotgun or drawing them into a small room with said shotgun. Each of these high levels were alone at the time. If you are like 1 M away (three feet) you can two tap almost anyone. The trick is getting close.The part that makes the high level players harder to fight is a mix of variables ( their guns have better rates of fire, smaller speads, better sights, % damaged increases etc.) they also have slightly better armor. But a main game mechanic they don't explain is MEDKITS.****TAKE NOTE:**** MEDKITS are the most important key game factor no one seems to talk about. You don't have them when you are new or low level and the high level people do... in spades.Med kits can be used as an instant heal to full HP with a 10 second cool down DURING COMBAT. So even if you get up behind a high level and ""blast away"" point blank - if you don't kill them quickly, literally before they can press their ""3"" key - they will pop one of their many med kits and get back to 100% HP intantly then turn and merk you or run for cover (then kill you).This is what most people compain about high levels owning them and say they are ""doing no dmg"".....You are doing damage, they are just healing through it.Also, the game is 100% headshot based. If you don't shoot someone in the head, they will take very little dmg. That one reviewer who said they shot someone in the head 300 times and the person didn't die is lying. Even with a med pack suriving that would be hacking.This ""headshots only"" mechanic why the higher level ""less weapon spead"" is so important as well.I thought I should mention the above as this is a PvP game and I would say the community is 50/50 split on low vs high ranks. Fight people your level, run from anyone who look like Darth Vader.Outside of this, you run around in a desloate forest / burned out cites collecting things. It's definatly not for everyone. You spend a lot of time alone, sneaking around trying to surive and collect what you can... gathering armor and ammo for 25 min and then BAM - you're in a BURTAL HEART THUMPING 30 second fire fight where you win or lose everything. It's a lot of waiting/build up for those few moments of amp'ed up fights but it can be damn worth it. Really gets your heart going.If you win said fight you try to get back to a safezone and bank your loots. If you die, you go back to being unarmed and useless.I've seen a few posted complaints about people/higher levels camping the safezones... don't run up the main road towards the safezone like a chumpolo... use the forest for cover. I've only had a dude chase me close/into the safe zone once but that was only because I killed him one town over and he respawned close. I've personally never been killed near a safezone or seen anyone camping it.Oh you can also spawn and instant die before anything like the above happens. Just think of it this way - when you have no loots pressure is kinda off, you can dance around the streets while poeple shoot at you - it doesn't matter.*Quick review*Sound/Ambient Sounds: Below Average- Gun sounds are meh, nothing really in depth or stand outish. All silencers sound the same, most guns sound                                                      he same just slower or faster bangs with the rate of fire.- There is one bird sound... omg that bird... all birds were killed apperatnly but that one speices with that singular sound that is always 10 meters from me.- You also get this rubble falling sound when in buildings but after the same rubble falling noise 50 times, you just ignore it.-Needs more variety.Graphics: Average- Somewhere between HL1 and HL2, dated but not breakingGameplay: Slightly Above Average- Must enjoy PvP- Must enjoy long walks along in the woods alone for extended peroids of time- No Pacemakers allowedGame Mechanics: Average- Average becuase I don't like the instant healing and the ""headshot"" only policy. Not that body shots do no dmg, but they are super weak. I like my game a little more realistic on the dmg via RO2.World Design/Layout: Slighty Above Average- Medium sized, easily run from one spot to another without sepdning forever. End to End however, phew, thats a long trip if you buddy spawns on the other side of the map. Set Auto run and have a smoke.-  You can tell some areas were created for PvP action with choke poitns etc.Verdict:Is it worth a buy? Yes for 20$ at the starter addition. Not the ungodly sum they want for the super mega package.Just be ready to grind it out and die a boat load. It will take a very long time to get to level 50 on a starter account.I doubt I'll make it that far but if I get 20 hours + at a buck and hour and had fun.. seems like a recommend to me.Thanks for reading,-Propaganda"

Shattered Skies has been hyped for a long time now and recently has came out on steam. This game is made by the same developers who made WarZ/Infestation. As we all know those games died fast. So now comes a really fun game that I can't stop playing. The game is based around an alien apocalypse with blood thirsty survivors. Death is all around. Now the developers are updating frequently and doing as much as they can to upgrade the game. THE GAME ITSELF IS NOT FREE TO PLAY AND IS NOT PAY TO WIN. It costs money to buy but it is worth it in my opinion! There is character customization which is a very important to players like me. You got to play in style! The game is not perfect, there are still some bugs that the developers need to fix. After all these are the same developers that made WarZ :P. Now the game DOES take lots of practice to master.

This is their 4th attempt, and don't let them fool you (I didn't see this game was made by them). I've made a small list of the reasons as for why you SHOULD NOT BUY this game.So, yeah... pretty much everything is failed in this game :- First of all, optimization apparently left the project early on, and was nowhere to be seen since then. As soon as you approach an area with a couple of sprites and scripts it starts to lag as hell...- Game feels like an alpha, seriously it seems they forgot to put the ""this game is currently in alpha"" on the steam page.- It's empty as hell, just cars and trucks and trees and rocks forever with water and peaches scattered here and there.- The required configuration displayed on the store is not correct, I have a far better PC than the minimum requirements, still I can barely run this ""game"" at 30FPS on low settings. This is the most unforgivable part of the review : guys you can't just scam people to the point of making fault statements on the store page. I could probably sue you for that if Steam didn't have a refund system. You're probably bad at optimization, then hire some competent coders to do your job, and while you're at it hire a whole crew of developpers, your games need it.- Money for level : really ? REALLY ? As if your game wasn't enough scammy and bad ? You had to put something to make people pay more than 20 bucks because Steam probably prevented you from selling this game full price ? God...- You're getting hunt down by the countless tasteless high level people already in the game. I seriously feel pity for them, how can you play such a bad game for such a long time ? I'm guessing those fanboys are probably the reason to why does the game has so many good reviews compared to its actual quality.You may have understood, I'm asking for a refund immediately, I didn't even make it to 1hour in game, so guys, just don't buy it, it's another zombie-like pvp survival made by russians, Free Reign doesn't deserve a single bit of your money or consideration.I hope one day things will change for indie studios like these, when finally a renouned company decides to make a good MMO zombie survival, crushing the last bit of those indie scammers. I'm getting tired of seeing tens of them spawning like rabbits in the shop and still making money because of people like me : desperate for a good survival MMO game. Fanboys will probably hate me for saying all that, but I don't care, it's just a fact, this game is far from being a honest experience and a decent game.If you want a survival game for now, you should probably stick to Rust (even with the XP thing), don't buy zombie/alien survival scams like this, it's just another moneyhole made by greedy indies, and I'm really starting to think about never buying again any 3D ""realistic games"" made by indies, as 99% of them are utter crap."

Playing solo in a populated server is impossible. So this game emphasises playing with freinds, if you can convince your freinds who have a decent PC to buy this then maybe it wont be so frustrating. But then what? All of the ""mission"" things on the map (dominion, merchants guild, BOC) are all exactly the same and can be easily accomplished by one player because all they are is holding ""E"" in front of console for a prescribed amount of time. You dont need freinds to do this, you only need freinds to help you not die in an ambush. So if you can just prevent ambushes, the game is pretty easy. How?The most efficient way to do that is to join an unpopulated or low pop server so that you just dont have to deal with many other players. Great, now you can move around without getting shot in the back and actually level up, all by yourself. This gets boring pretty fast.Also, the ""how to play"" video doesnt tell you half of what you need to know and other players will not be helping you either.In summary:Playing in a group is pointless as long as lower pop servers are available, and playing this game by yourself is really boring and usually very frusterating when you inevitably bump into a group of 4. Being bored and frusterated isnt much fun."

Graphics are pretty decent but need some refining to remove some of the blurriness of weapons and objects. Combat seems decent for a game this early in development but we need to see some melee weapons because it really sucks when you run out of ammo and have no other way to fight back other than to run away and hide. I like the amount of loot scattered around but the wilderness is very empty and you can only find loot in towns or marked places on the map. I don't like the Alien AI so far because they just randomly teleport in right near you and always seem to know where you are. It would be nice to see wandering enemies strolling around in towns and such. AI also needs to be smarter because right now they get stuck a lot. I have been having fun with this game even though every single player I have come across has been unfriendly and wants to kill me. Pretty hard to find someone you can trust to play with. Anyway, I like the game and can't wait to see where they go with it. MAKE THE MAP BIGGER and add loot in the wilderness and maybe a few cabins, camps, random buildings in the middle of nowhere etc etc..."

If you are going to have a level based advancement, why have all levels in the same game?  I am level 8 and have been killed (without any chance of survival) by high levels as soon as we come into contact.2. As stated above, if you are going to use the ""DAYZ"" method of player vs player looting, then lose the leveling and stick to player skill for survival.  Use the level based advancement for crafting only....Overall I haven't played the game too long, but that is because I lose all my gear (yes you lose every single item upon death) to higher levels frequently.  There is a positive side as loot is everywhere you look but still becomes frustrating when player skill stands no chance in a level mismatch 30 vs 8.In its current state, I recommend you try it.....But beware as fun factor fades quickly with my above description."

I came back 5 min later to check it and the entire topic was deleted. Topic was called ""Visual downgrade from ISS?""I just wanted to remind people of what this game engine is capable of.. And would still be capable of  if they just maintained their quality standards. Shattered skies does not even use photograph based textures. At least ISS trees were textured by you know.. Photos of real trees.http://i1324.photobucket.com/albums/u607/RandalMcdaniels/Infestationexe_2013-10-23-17-36-36-372_zps48fb2fc5.png(That screenshot was taken during 2 month period of time when the graphics overhaul was in place. The graphic overhaul was quickly removed when 1-2 people made topics saying it killed their fps when in fact the overhaul improved fps)**REVIEW OF GAME**I really wanted to love this game, warz/iss was my favorite game of all time and i had sunk well over 7.5k hours in that game. I used to have tremedous respect for this developer which is why i purchased this game in a heartbeatI sadly have to admit it..This game is just god awful, it just feels like a free2play web browser arcade game. The environment looks like shredded spinach, the aliasing is piercing, the trees have been textured manually (instead of using textures from photographs of real trees like in the screenshot above) and many other textures seem like they were imported instead of created specially for the game. The graphics as a whole do not blend together well.-There are no monsters pre-existing in the world, they are scripted to spawn directly near you when you enter an area with buildings or sheds. This repeats every 3 minutes guaranteed. Each monster takes roughly 3 clips to kill. So once you kill two monsters you are already bored with the routine.-No melee items (no katanas no baseball bats no machetes)-All 80+ authentic weapon models introduced in warz are no longer in the game, they now use sci-fi derpy colorful looking rifles that look like they were all purchased from toys r us-The most bipolar, unoriginal, just plain wacky environment i have ever seen in a game. There is no place on planet earth that resembles this odd environment. You have one forest full of nothing but towering evergreens, than between them you just randomly see a lush hot-orange tall bush tree inbetween them. I had to rub my eyes to make sure i wasnt halucinating. Absolutely atrocious. At least in warz/iss they replicated real locations-Most uninspired map i have ever seen in an open world game. No waterfalls, no lakes, no rivers, no rope bridges, no quarries, no caves. Just a continuation of hills and copy/paste same exact houses/sheds from the last place you just visited.-100fps somehow only manages to feel like 40. This issue was introduced sometime between ISS and romeros aftermath and still persists to this day. Someone messed up a line of code somewhere and its still never been fixed.-Just absolutely nothing to do. In warz i could literally live in the game.

I'm assuming the game isn't meant to be ran off of nvidia graphic cards or something because after finally getting into a server and placing everything off or in low quality setting I was running at 15 FPS average. I have a very decent graphic card (Geforce GTX 970M). Its not the best by no means but it should be able to handle this game decently. Especially on the settings I had set. I did manage to play a little trying to forget about the annoying FPS problem. The game seems really fun. I came across a guy trying to hunt me, which was pretty fun. Of course, with my FPS, I was not trying to engage this guy. It was still fun. Looting and fighting aliens are an interesting concept in this game. Aliens tend to spawn out of nowhere so be careful of that. Anyways, if you can run the game (hope you have a super sport car engine in you computer) then I would recommend this game, but if you have a graphic card par or lower then mine stay far away from this game. Its not going to happen. Unless you like games that average 15 FPS. Im going make contact with the support tech to maybe help. If they cant help Im going to request a refund."

Many good people played it, the community was great, the devs somehow worked on it. I had a TON of fun with my friends looting, doing reactors, pvping and trading. But since the Global Inventory Wipe and the reworked mechanics the game became more and more dead. There is literally no one playing anymore. If the devs would just have listened to the Community and released updates frequently instead of just saying we cant release it yet, the game would have been really great.I wouldn't mind playing it right now tho, but its just dead. Completly dead. I hope some emulators come to life.DO NOT BUY IT NOW! IT IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY!"
