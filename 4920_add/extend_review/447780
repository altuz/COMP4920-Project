Game looks and sounds beautiful, and the mouse controls work perfectly. A lot of the UI seems to have been adapted from the iOS versions rather than the original, but it works fine and they even redrew the tutorial prompts showing a mouse.So, given that the game has been converted well, I highly recommend it, as the original was one of my favorite games at the time. I think it's aged well, and remains a relaxing and beautiful indie game. Might feel a bit short if you buy each game separately, but the two-game bundle is a good value."
,Recommended,447780,31130389,Posted: 14 April,all,I Got a Rock,"I was not even aware this game was on PC until it went on sale this weekend, but I played the HELL out of this game on the Wii when it first came out as a WiiWare launch title. I haven't played this game since like 2009 or 2010, but it left such an impression on me that I could still remember a good amount of the music, most of the mechanics, and even some details as minute as the specific sounds of characters and enemies. That's how good this game was.However, the big question is: How good is this port? The answer to that is a little more complicated than it might seem.There are a few differences from the classic WiiWare version I grew up on that I liked, and some that I disliked. The biggest thing I liked about this version over the classic version is that when you start drawing gusts, the game does not slow down. In the original game, the drawing sequence was played out in slow motion to give you more precise aim, but here it doesn't do that. Therefore, the game feels a lot faster by comparison.Something I disliked, however, was a lack of difficulty. The game was never truly difficult on the WiiWare version, but in this version, they seem to have removed all forms of self-damage like falling or hitting yourself with a heavy object. These were rare occurrences, but fall damage at least gave you a reason to slow your descent and causing damage with boulders gave you a reason to want to use Slipstream over Gust to move objects to avoid hitting yourself.Lastly, something I'm not sure how to feel about. This port seems to be structured like a mobile game, which I'm assuming is the case since this game was also on iOS devices before an iOS update caused compatibility issues. The result is a feature that wasn't included in the original game (at least as far as I remember): the world map. It is a half-decent guide as to where you are, but honestly I'd much prefer to just go without one. Luckily, this feature isn't jammed in your face, so it's easy to ignore. Also, I have only played for one session, but that session did end with a crash. Not sure how frequent crashes are, but it seemed relatively smooth otherwise.TL;DR - This is a fantastic puzzle adventure game with a decent PC port that in my opinion is about equal with the original WiiWare launch title in terms of quality."

However, unlike others, you are just partially controlling the character itself *you can only run left and right*, but you also control a windspirit with the mouse. Said windspirit can gust the character, pick up items and flatten enemies.If there is one flaw with this game, then this: It is too short."
,Recommended,447780,28605672,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,☠Afro Punk🐴🎮,"A Wiiware port. One of the very good games that was ported from the Nintendo wii. Gamplay structure and set up is similar to the metroid series, which require you to explore and only allow you to get further with a new ability. Being this game is a wiiport, the game mechanics requires you do do flick of the wrist jestures, which in my opinion can be strenuous on the wrist when using a mouse. This game is very short and quick to the point, which is good for my very short attention span.The music is very majestic, personally speaking. In this day and age when music requires a dept of instruments and different degrees of melodic tunes in one instrumental. LostWinds has nice serene music that fits the vibe. Maybe i haven't paid attention but i think i heard 2 or 3 different music throughout the game. The music isn't aggressively annoying as some games, when recycling its music, rather more relaxing.Graphically the game is simple, being its a wiiware port. If i remember on the wii, the game was about 30-something mbs so it had graphical restrictions then. The game has some flat textures, but if youre not a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ then you will appreciate the art style over the details. I enjoyed what i played and this game satisfied me, may satisfy others.I really dont have many complains for the game, aside of not being able to pick my resolution settings. You wont be able to choose any graphical settings, as if that metters. I personally think any pc can run this game.Note: Easy achievements for people who enjoy achievement hunting."

And the mouse makes it arguably nicer to control than the Wii Remote.The game is beautiful, charming, and sweet. The music is lovely. The game is short; the playtime you see on my profile is a full runthrough (albeit I still need to find a few more hidden collectables). So if you've got a couple hours to spare, you can't go wrong with this."

It has ported across very nicely, the graphics are crisp, the tutorials and menus have been given an overhaul and the audio (being as good as all Frontier's efforts) didn't need touching.Well worth it for a game that really thought outside the box and got it right."

Steam lists my total game time as 2.1 hours.  For a ten dollar game, I'd expect a little more.-Seemed a little too simple.  I'd love some more complex puzzles.-Some of the mechanics were a little short-lived-I really wanted a regular jump button because sometimes I needed to get over a rock that was on a switch.  Whenever I'd try to fling Toku over, it took the rock as well.  It was a bit frustrating at times--though in no way was it game-breaking.-The storyline was very genericOverall, LostWinds was really cute.  The graphics were so adorable and perfect.  Before playing, I'd no idea this had any metroidvania elements.  The whole game felt like a bite-size introduction into the metroidvania genre.  While the wind mechanic was fun, it was underutilized.  It was way too short of a game and, as a result, seemed like a waste of potential.  The game even had the gall to advertise the sequel after the credits.  Still, it was well polished and fun.  Too short to buy full priced, though."

But that is what it is: a childrens game. The story isn't too dark or deep, the puzzles are easy to solve and finding the way forward is relatively easy.As a port from the wii to keyboard I found it satisfying. Your mouse controls the wind, and you can swish and swosh back and forth, it even interacts with the background which was my favorite part! (Trees and flowers would fly away, watermills and windmills would turn, it's great!)The only two negative things is 1. It's very short (I only took 2,3 hours to complete it, and that was with exploring the entire game) and 2. I don't recall anywhere it saying that SPACE was the key to use to interact with objects, maybe I missed it, but I stood infront of the rune in the beginning and tried everything. In the end space worked.(Edit)- Another negative thing is that I've completed the game but there's still 2 card drops remaining! >:(Normally I'd say the price is steep for only 2 hours of gameplay, however with the interactive backgrounds and adorable animation I feel like it was a nice purchase. I did however snag both 1 and 2 during the last summer sale and then they were a lot cheaper!If you got kids, or younger siblings, I really recommend this game, it's a great starter game :)"

The story is simplistic, but it's a relaxing 3-4 hour game of not-too-complex puzzles. As the game isn't particularly expensive and does go on sale for up to 75% off, it seems to be worth the money. The graphics are of their era, but hold up pretty well with their stylization.

,Recommended,447780,24353458,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Allthegoodnamestaken,"Recommended on sale. I feel I got my money's worth for ~$3, but $10 is definitely steep for a two hour, 8 year old Wii port.LostWinds is another entry in the somewhat bizarre, but largely successful, genre of ""platformers without jump buttons."" Instead, you control a wind spirit that can push the main character and other objects around with gusts.Like everything in the game, this mechanic works and is largely entertaining, but there isn't really enough done with it. You'll see variations on about 5 puzzles repeated throughout the game, and any challenge derives more from game's occasionally finnicky controls than anything intended in the design. Everything is nice to look at in spite of the age, and the characters are all visually well designed, but the story is threadbare and almost everyone is a signpost. I was initially very impressed by the soundtrack until realizing that the two songs I'd enjoyed were basically all there was. And so on.If you go in expecting nothing more than a few hours of decent entertainment, you'll probably have a good time. It's a shame that LostWind's strong fundamentals weren't developed into something more memorable, but what's here is by no means bad.EDIT: Forgot to mention that the card and background designs are fantastic. It's almost worth the sale price for those alone, although you'll probably need to idle after finishing the game to get all the card unlocks."
,Recommended,447780,33415050,Posted: 9 July,all,Serieus,"Fun casual platforming metroidvania style game.  The spirit of the stone has been lost and you must find it to recover it and save the land.  The gimmick for the gameplay is that you can use wind to move your character around.  You gain new powers as you advance in the game in how to use that wind to your advantage.  Nothing difficult here, a lot of backtracking, and few things to collect for achievements.  Simple story, music, graphics, and gameplay, but it all comes together well in this short little game.  Short because the end is... to be continued."

Story is a bit cheesy, but it gives me a felling of nostalgia since I played games like these as a kid all the time.Obviously, the most interesting part of the game is the wind mechanic. From the title, I hope you can infer that wind is included in this game. However, I didn't know that you control it with your mouse, and you can manipulate the enviroment as well as yourself to get where you need to be.So far I love it. We'll see about the length of story and how well it keeps me entertained soon."

A port of an early WiiWare game from 2008, I enjoyed the opportunity to revisit LostWinds. The port is pretty good, although I have experienced a few crashes - the game's fairly generous saving means that isn't normally a problem, but it can occasionally grind.The game is short, and combined with its age I would be wary of paying full price. Any reduction, though, and you will be treated to a novel and sweet puzzle-platformer."

You move with WASD, everything else is done with your mouse. I'd say this is pretty much the perfect game for kids if you want to teach them logic. I dislike logic puzzles, which is why I had to motivate myself to stay in there, but its a great experience non the less. The cuteness of characters and stories makes this great for everyone. No options menu, no launcher, thats the only thing I am disappointed at. At least let me change resolutions."

However, it felt more like a tutorial than a full complete game. By the end I still thought I was in a tutorial and hadn't even started the game. WHY IS IT SO SHORT? :( i was really disapointed by this. Most games I will quite easily play for 100 hours + and still not be near completion. This game was completed in under 3 hours. It had so much potential to go alot further, it's such a shame. I recomend the game for the fact it is nicly made, it's nice to play, it has great music and lovely artwork. But if your looking for something that lasts longer than a short afternoon game play then your looking at the wrong game. I'm just hoping that the second lost winds game is longer and has more to it, since I bought it as a bundle and on a sale i can't complain to much.

The puzzles weren't all that difficult and it was very obvious that certain areas were blocked for a later time which is nice.
