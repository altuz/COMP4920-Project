,Recommended,447820,33686073,Posted: 20 July,all,❆SubZeroDestruction❆trade.tf,"Day of Infamy; A lovely WW2 Based FPS created by the guys who worked on Insurgency.There isn't that much negative so I'll try to make this as short as possible.Pros:Great Sound Effects and VOs.Great Graphics especially for the engine being used (Source) of which also allows lower end computers/laptops to run this.Great Map Design.Grass and Churches.Good diversity in game modes.A options menu... with a handful of options.Cons:Lack of map choice in a way. While there are 13 maps currently, most of the time only the same handful of maps will get played due to the voting system of which most players like to vote for the same ones they like. And while it is a good feature to have, for some it might become somewhat repetitive to not be able to play the other maps that get rarely chosen.Slight lack of weapon diversity. While it does help keep balance, I'm almost certain there still are some guns that could still be added. However updates after the time of posting this review may add some more, but for the time being there isn't much per-say in overall choice. Which again, may deter some from purchasing.Some users in the community have binds that allow them to spam voice-lines of which there is no way to ""currently"" mute. So some may find that running across these users may become an annoyance and possible deterant from wanting to play due to the fact that the spam can be a hindrance to their ability to properly listen out for enemy fire, footsteps or other forms of sound to help in their ability to outplay the enemy. The only mute currently in the game is for Voice-Chat. However if an update comes out that allows for the muting of specific players ingame character. Then that would be a large QOL fix for some.Side Note:A small annoyance I find with Flame Throwers is that they are a bit hit and miss on when it counts damage, as it more or less only connects damage when held down rather than a quick tap; so in some cases while you see flame particles. No actual damage is given unless you fully hold down the fire. So in some cases where you get caught off-guard and are startled you might not hold it down in fear of killing a team-mate while at that moment the enemy will have most likely killed you.(This doesn't go for everyone and is just a small grudge for me; I'm probably just horrible with it lmao)Final Verdict:For 19.99$ (20$) Is the game worth it? Yes I would say for every cent yes. If you are able to get it on sale especially for 50% Off or more get it; you won't regret it. On top of that is for Insurgency owners (Or Vice-Versa) you get 10% off the game, so for a sale that makes the purchase price even better.While it has a somewhat small learning curve for the basics, it does have a somewhat large mastering curve for the learning of map layouts and other small features that you may not get in the first few hours which may deter you from being interested in it.Personal PC Specs used while playing for this review:Intel HD Graphics 5500.Core i3-5020U CPU @ 2.20GHz8 GB Ram.Game Settings Used:Noteable SettingsScope Detail: MediumGlobal Shadow Quality: Very LowMulti-Core Rendering: EnabledPaged Pool Memory Available: EnabledFiltering Mode: Anistropic X2Every other setting was Low or Disabled.I hope this has helped you on your buying decision.Edit 1:Correction on totalcurrentmaps from 10 to 11.Edit 2:Updated maps from 11 to 13 from the latest update ""Dunkirk."""
,Recommended,447820,24592059,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,Seanicus,"It is the day of infamy! Puns aside, it is the release date of Day of Infamy and it has been a long time coming!So what is Day of Infamy? Day of Infamy in simple terms is a tactical realistic first person shooter set in WW2, mostly the Western, Mediterranean and Italian Fronts. Each map is based off a real location and battles that took part in the war. The whole aim of the game is to provide a realistic and brutal experience of World War 2. There is no real room for mistakes here. Most shots can end your life in one hit. There are no cross hairs painted on your monitor. Explosions will rip you apart. It is a brutal game to say the least. I would say this game is like Day of Defeat, Red Orchestra, Call of Duty 1, 2 and United Offensive and shoved into a great shooter. The life of this game started back in Insurgency as a workshop mod and it evolved into this stand alone game today, this doesn't sit well with some people which is understandable. It is on the Source Engine if that means anything to you. It's stable but of course long in the tooth like any Source game.  I'll cut up the review into sections of things I'll address. No particular order here.=Weapons=The weapons are pretty much what you'd expected. M1 Garands, K98s, Enfields, 1911s, STGs, MP40s and even some oddballs like a C96 M1932 ""Schnellfeuer"" that is a full auto pistol carbine. Most are deadly as one would expect without armor and such. The models look rather nice, nothing crazy like tiger stripe camo or crazy skins and such (Unless you scour the Workshop for them!). There is a bit of anachronism going on in this game. The rifle grenades for the Lee-Enfield isn't the cup launcher you'd expect, it's an ENERGA from the 1950s. The M1 Carbine is also the same with adjustable sights and bayonet lugs. The Vickers machine gun is quite interesting. The M1 Garand rifle grenades are Anti Tank grenades, not the fragmentation you'd expect. Some questionable scope choices. Suppressed sub machine guns (like the Sten and such) are locked to Co-op (kinda sucks if you want a Brit commando flare since we literally have No. 2 Commando as a unit option).  Regardless, the weapons handle well if you can avoid your history nerdrage at some choices.=Soldiers/Units=Wouldn't be a WW2 game without the units that fought in it! The Americans, Commonwealth and Germans all have a pool of ""Units"" that are based off actual units that fought in the war. NOW some people have complained about them being micro-transactions and DLCs. These people are IDIOTS. You unlock Units by simply playing the game. Last night I got 3 in about an hour run, the 1st Infantry Division for the US, Royal Fusiliers for the Commonwealth and the 15th Panzergrenadiers for the Germans. Each unit has a different appearance compared to the default army everyone starts with. Some German units have all sorts of German camos like the iconic Splittermuster and Pea Dot. Commonwealth have different members of the Commonwealth (Canadians for explain or the Indian troops). They're all purely cosmetic and depending on what map you're playing you might not even see them as an option. It makes for a decent player retention for those that like collecting shiny things that offer nothing special.  Of course it only works if you plan to go the route of playing to unlock them rather than spending the money up front. All in all, anyone ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the DLC/Microtransactions are morons.=Audio=As mentioned before, a lot of the audio is solid and if you wish you can change them out with sound mods in the Workshop. The sounds of combat are excellent with cracks and whips of bullets whizzing over head and explosions deafening you for a period of time. Guns sound like guns. One bit I really like is the voice acting. I absolutely love the Canadian army and the voice acting. Lots of ""eh"" and ""bud"" being used. On top of that I love the interaction of the soldiers. Commanders/Team Leaders have a unique voice command that asks all the players in the general vicinity ""Is everyone alright?"" which queue plenty of hilarious replies such as the Canadians say ""Eh I've seen worse"" and so on. Another is how the troops talk and react in varying degrees of stressful situations. If you're just standing around they talk normally and such. In high stress like combat and explosions, they're yelling and cursing like sailors. Again Canadians are the best ""ENEMY TO THE WEST SHOOT THEM YOU GOOFS!"" etc. It's nice that the troops behave like human beings, not stoic silent stone walls. Everything looks as it does and sounds like it does. If you dislike the audio, you can find numerous sounds mods in the Workshop and such. HELL you can even find the old Day of Defeat original sounds.P.S.: Canadians need a special ""Sorry"" voice command.=Gore=It wouldn't be a game based on a costly world war without the causalities of war. The gore system in the game is quite good and dare I saw superior to the gore system of the popular Red Orchestra series. Limbs get blown off by explosions actually have detailed bones and articles of clothing that got ripped off. A leg sports the pant leg, the white bone sticking out of the mess of blood, muscle and tendons. The body seems to be  cut into sections, the simplest of explosions could sever a foot (with the boot still on, toe bones sticking out of the ruined leather) or a hand, all the way up to a whole arm or leg. I have never seen decapitation or the removal of a head which is kinda lacking but regardless what we have right now is perfectly fine for those that like their games bloody and gorey. You'll be pretty pleasantly surprised. Hell I think I have a screenshot of a severed German leg standing straight up with the boot still on. Silly stuff like that can occur. Ragdolls are of course what you'd expect from Source, they have weight according to your equipment and such. Flamethrowers burn and cause the poor souls to spasm in a vain effort to stop them from becoming Anakin from Revenge of the Sith. All that is left is silence and a charred corpse.♥♥♥♥♥♥be brutal yo.=Maps=Maps are the very generic standard affair of a WW2 shooter and a Source engine game. They support a 32 (or 40) player  well enough that you don't feel overly cramped. They're small like most Source 16v16 games but they're well done. Maps range from Crete during Operation Mercury in 1941 all the way to Reichswald in 1945 as the last spasms of the Germans hold out. All your classics like Dog Red (Omaha Beach) and Salerno (Avalanche). Most of the maps are based on the Western front or the Italian front with the oddball Crete of the early Mediterranean Campaign. Of course there are some Workshop maps but I rarely seem them running on servers. We'll definitely have Map contests like we already had before hand. Tobruk was one of these contest maps that sadly came as a runner up but we definitely could use some North Africa maps.=Workshop=One of the big things that keeps games populated is the community and their creativity. Workshop allows for that. I'm only adding this because of the deep level of conversions we've seen in games like this. Right now we have a workshop mod called Born To Kill which takes DoI to the jungles of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The same level of detail and such is present in the BoK mod. It is well done and I wish more servers ran it! There is also news of a World War 1 mod coming to Day of Infamy that involves the old WW1 Source team. Definitely keep your eyes out for these two if you're ever wanting to experience other wars!All in all, it's worth the 20 bucks."
,Recommended,447820,31389180,Posted: 27 April,all,Sartor Resartus,"If you can hear the Stuka, it's already too late.The team that made Insurgency made a WW2 shooter that is *heavily* inspired by Day of Defeat. That's an executive summary that should tell most people what they want to know.This game is solid. It's on the Source engine, it's got a great team behind it, it's inspired by one of the best shooters in the genre, and the growing community is (at least by comparison) very friendly. The gun-play feels excellent, much like Insurgency. Weapons have distinct characteristics, have a nice ""weight"" to them, and reward you for knowing how to use them properly. Bullets are lethal. With some smaller caliber weapons it can take a couple rounds to drop someone, but generally speaking if you shoot someone, they're done. The audio/visual effects that kick in when a bunch of bullets or shrapnel pass over your head provide a built-in mechanic for functional suppression, which good MGs will known how to use effectively. Victory is based on objectives and the way they have to be captured in a specific order that will be familiar to Day of Defeat players.This visuals are exactly what you'd expect from a Source game. It runs very smoothly and the design team made levels that are very believable. There's a sense of theatrics about most of the maps that help with the immersion and the feel that you're playing out scenes from A Bridge Too Far. The smoke effects are great - and you will see them a lot, the use of smoke in this game is incredibly important. This is a nice touch to see from someone who studied the history of WW2 a lot.Sound is often overlooked in reviews but I have to stress this point - Day of Infamy sounds amazing. Explosions range from the dull crump of grenades to the seismic cacophony of a bombing run. Gunfire is realistic - the rifles especially have a nice ""bark"" to them that threads between being too ""poppy"" and too ""earth-shaking-boom-a-la-Hollywood"". The sounds are also easily distinguishable after some experience. Give it a couple rounds and you will have no trouble identifying the grinding buzzsaw that is the MG42.This is a good one. It feels genuine, and it has the brutally traditional gun-play of the shooters it draws inspiration from. You won't find this sort of vibe in a lot of the more polished, big budget FPS titles. At 20USD this should be a pretty easy decision to make. Grab a radio, and follow your squad leader around so the two of you can call in some gun runs on a German strongpoint.Oh - and stand behind the man with the flamethrower."

For that bolt-action killstreak that makes your toes curl in ecstasy; that epic grenade toss-back -- and the trash talk that accompanies it; or the final point capture under an ungodly amount of fire.

And that's exactly what DOI is - it's one of the best online FPSs available now, and the best FPS released so far in 2017.The gameplay involves more than just infantry combat - you also get artillery bombardments, airstrikes and strafing runs - it can get pretty crazy at times. The classes on offer all play really well and their weapons are realistic, very well-balanced and impactful. The maps are great, both mechanically and visually. Graphics-wise, the game is pushing the 14-year old Source engine to its absolute breaking point, and it shows - performance can get a bit choppy, but the game looks pretty good overall.If you're looking for an FPS like no other with properly balanced, realistic hardcore action, as well as some of the most hectic and intense combat you'll ever see in a game, Day of Infamy is for you."

,Recommended,447820,24652123,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,ϟHavocϟ,"I would reccomend this for lovers of ww2 games, however there are three main issues with the gameplay.Firstly, you can not check your magazine like in Red orchestra 2, realistically you can balance a magazine in your hand and estimate roughly how full it is... or half open a breach to see if even has a round chambered.Secondly, the lee enfield rifle, when cocked in real life, does not need to come out of the shoulder, with training (which in ww2, they had...) you could fire and bolt it without losing your aim to do so. This is not present in game making the lee enfield undeservedly weak compared to any other weapon choice.Thirdly, the webley service evolver, had an auto-eject when opened, which would push out any shells that had been fired, those that hadn't been fired (still had the bullet in) wouldn't be pushed out far enough to fall out, giving a very fast reload time and preventing the waste of ammunition. Again this isn't present in game, meaning you waste ammo from loading too early.Overall i would still reccomend this game, it's more fun than insurgency as nobody has armour, meaning the bots arent ridiculously hard to kill. It can be quite fun, but pistols could do with a little damage boost, since they're distinctively weak, even the webley... sadfaceTLDR: Good game but i'm butthurt about underpowered Commonwealth."

Browse the workshop for possible existing tweaks.* Graphics is upper bound by the Source engine but it's compensated by the artwork and proper use of lighting.#   It doesn't look half bad at all, to be honest.* And most importantly, when your teammates play their role right and coordinate together, fighting alongside your comrades and earning that well-deserved victory, you'll know that this is a FPS game THAT ACTUALLY HAS DEPTH IN IT.#   It doesn't happen every round since great teams are hard to come by, but when the stars align you'll want to come back for more, I guarantee.Seriously, scr3w those games that has poor game mechanics / map designs / bloating 'features' and only 'realistic' graphics as its redeeming factor.

It captures something of the sense of realism and personal fragility that you had in games of this ilk 15 years ago like Hidden and Dangerous and Operation Flashpoint combined with the fast paced arcade thrills of Day of Defeat and the original CoD. The developers are clearly enthusiasts who had a clear vision of the sort of game they wanted to make and haven’t been forced to compromise by any meddling corporate backers.The graphics are nice enough even if the engine isn’t cutting edge, the maps are all atmospheric and fun to play and the gun models are satisfying and detailed. The sound design is absolutely tremendous; explosions, gunshots and the screams of your enemies are all visceral and create a sense of the brutal violence of battle.Explosions blow arms and legs off and throw majestic jets of gore spray into the air. Shooting someone once in the chest kills them. Guns have realistic recoil characteristics and ammo is limited. All of these things make for tense and exhilarating situations in game. But there also quiet moments where you creep around trying to flank the enemy or move up with your squad into defensive positions; it’s not just relentless shooting and explosions where you don’t know what’s really going on in the battle and you don’t feel like what you’re doing has any impact on its outcome (like in EAs Battlefield) there’s room for quiet tactical play and tense moments where you are expecting an attack but you don’t know when or where from.I get the impression that this game is played by other man children like myself who enjoy a challenging shooter and have nostalgia for the WW2 fps of the 2000s which they grew up playing. So if you are in that demographic you’ll find that DOI is a masterpiece and it will be the best £15 you’ll spend on a game in a long time."

The maps will take you from snowy entrechments to Italian vistas and blown up cities. Im happy to report this is still insurgency, just with WW2 guns. The multiplayer game modes are typical in a shooter, but I feel the map design is as solid as ever. I have always loved the linear design of NWI's maps, how they force direct, intense squad vs. squad firefights rather than backtracking and mindless sprinting.The weapons are glorious and you can tell an incredible amount of time and research has been invested into them. The models are crisp and for the most part accurately designed. Here is a short list of my favorite weapons from each faction-GERMANY-MG42- The most fun weapon to shoot in Day of Infamy. There is nothing like setting up a buzzsaw on a window and playing map denial.STG-44- Functions very similar to the AK in Insurgency, with great stopping power. Perfect for running and gunning.GEWEHR-43- Semi-Automatic rifle, reliable and behaves very similar to SKS in Insurgency. Usually get away with one or two tap on chestshots.-BRITISH-STEN GUN!- I am happy to report that this gun is kickass! You have the option of putting a silencer on it, which makes firing more anonymous. VERY reliable close-quarters submachine gun.VICKERS- Not quite the MG42, slower fire but functions the same. Played on sandbags/windows MG's are absolute devastation.LEE ENFIELD- IMO the most reliable bolt action in Day of Infamy. The sights are the least restrictive and I feel like I have better luck with it. Usually get away with one shots in the chest.-AMERICAN-BROWNING- Second in place after the MG42. Where the 42' has rate of fire the Browning has stopping power. I feel like its similar to shooting a 9mm vs. 45. acp. The gun doesnt fire as fast as the Vickers either, but it only takes one bullet to drop ANYTHING moving closer than 100 yards.THOMPSON-My favorite submachine gun in Day of Infamy. The platform for the Tommy Gun is a tried and true design, with reliability being one of its most important aspects. This really will let you ace 4-5 targets with one mag while running to an objective.M1 Garand- LAST BUT NOT LEAST the Garand. This rifle has been in more WW2 video games than I can count, but theres a reason for it. It's damn good.It's also important to mention there is Co-op. (You're not allowed to be new however, people will swear at you if you're the last one alive. The Co-op community can be a mixed bag. My brother is not very ""good"" at shooters. We play together and I constantly have to remind people that he is new and to leave him alone.) Stronghold has you capture points, and by doing so you revive your fallen comrades. Entrenchment is the opposite, and by far more fun IMO. I typically avoid defense in video games because I'm not a fan of sitting in one spot for too long, but when you have weapons like these, it becomes a non issue. Raid is a new game mode similar to Insurgency's co-op where you are tasked with destroying supplies and artillery cannons.10/10This and Insurgency have slowly become my favorite shooters of all time. Buy it, add me, and let's play."

,Recommended,447820,30696337,Posted: 23 March,all,Cap'n Red Ivan🍕,"Day of Infamy is a stellar multiplayer shooter that I personally believe triumphs over most every shooter on the market today.The game appeals on nearly all levels, from the easy to play hard to master gameplay, to the bombastic display of artillery hammering the enemy, getting wiped out by a stuka, and charging with the team through smoke into the woodchipper. The weapons play a hellish orchestra of gunshots, the explosions kick up earth and people alike, the minimalist hud and feel of the weapons make this a very immersive game. If you don't care about the look and feel of a game, Day of Infamy still has you covered.Day of Infamy is a nigh perfect blend of slow paced street and building combat, and close quarters frantic action. When you're on some larger maps, you need to be observant and careful, making good use of cover and flanks to pick off the enemy and advance. Other maps have shorter distances you can see, or lots of cover or more intricate interiors leading to  constant movement and quick combat. The game knows this, and has superb balance. The general sense of balance is high rate of fire, lack of instakill potential and accuracy vs low rate of fire, instakill potential and high accuracy. Most guns dominate in areas others cant. The guns that are more akin to assault rifles are limited in quantity and often have some sort of caveat. Despite this, the high lethality of weapons means skill dominates this game. With a bolt action, utilizing the circular and low visibility nature of the bunker I was in, and the bolt action's ability to kill people instantly, I was able to take out 8 enemies by myself. The excellent weapon balance, the ability for skill to determine a fight even when the odds are against you, and the asymmetrical faction weapon selection leads to an incredibly interesting game with plenty of variety in the way a firefight can play out. On top of this, officers, with the help of a radioman can call in artillery strikes, carpet bombings, smoke barrages, dive bombers, gun runs, white phosphorus, and bunker busting rockets. All of this adds up to a single game that can deliver both the feel of a chaotic ♥♥♥♥-festival, and the feel of a slow and deadly crawl through a map.Does the game sound complex or daunting so far? It isnt. Someone who can walk onto an objective and shoot people every so often is a welcome addition to any team. The teamplay, while basic, works as much as it could possibly need to. Stick with your teammates so theres more targets than you for the enemy to shoot, and more guns than your own to shoot enemies with. Unless you play officer, which isn't necessary as theres usually somebody there to do it, the most complex it'll get for you is standing next to an officer as a radioman.This game isn't without its flaws however. The graphics, while I'm fine with them, some(cet) may consider them subpar. There are occasional bugs with fire support and weapon animations, which I'm not sure if they're actually fixable and can be attributed to the ancient piece of technology known as ""Source Engine"". Sometimes, enemies and their muzzleflashes can be hard to spot and your eyesight will be a fairly large factor in how good you'll be in some maps. Lastly the game can be frustrating at times if your team refuses to cooperate or if some god on the other team is going full John Mcclain Super Commando mode. While most of these issues can cause legitimate problems with the game, they aren't common enough to be at all considered game breaking.tl;dr Day of Infamy is one of the most well balanced, well designed, satisfying, immersive, and straight up fun multiplayer shooters I've played in the past maybe 10 years, and saying anything less than I give it a wholehearted recommendation to anyone looking for a realistic, action packed multiplayer shooter would be a bold faced lie."
,Recommended,447820,30046607,Posted: 19 February,all,eric1894,"Having just hit 250 hours in the game, I feel like it's about time I give my very first Steam review.Day of Infamy is a game that gives you a feeling of nostalgia, but at the same time provides a pretty unique WWII FPS experience with game mechanics such as the localized VOIP, and the officer being able to call in artillery strikes, bombing runs, strafing runs and supply drops with the help from a radioman. It is a game that encourages and rewards good teamplay.The gameplay is tactical and immersive, without being overly realistic or clunky. It's fairly fast paced, without feeling overly arcadey. It has a wide variety of classes and weapons to choose from, the voice acting is excellent, the sound design is superb, and for being on the Source engine it's actually a really good looking game. It has a ranking system, with multiple unlockable units for all three factions being worked on. The factions in the game are the U.S. Army, the Commonwealth Army and the German Wehrmacht.You can tell that the developers are as passionat about this game as the community members are. New updates are constantly being pushed out, with new content and community requests being added, bug fixes, game balancing and more. The devs are really fantastic, and the community is for the most part nice and friendly.This is a purchase you won't regret - you will get many many hours of fun and memorable WWII action.

Keeps me from getting burned by terrible Early Access games. I usually do a lot of reserach and watch gameplay videos before I even consider buying any game on Steam and that goes triple for Early Access games. Thank Gaben for the return policy.I don't recall exactly where on YouTube I saw Day of Infamy being played for the first time, but I fell instantly in love. It looked like a better version of Red Orchestra 2 (Forgive me fanboys) and Day of Defeat Source. Games I've both enjoyed (Day of Defeat far more). However, Day of Infamy was an Early Access game. I had to stick by my rule. I just couldn't buy this game in its current state.20 seconds later I said ""♥♥♥♥ the rule"" and went ahead and bought it. I've needed my WWII shooter itch scratched for a long time now and Day of Infamy has scratched it down to the bone. It's difficult, deep, fun, exciting, and even nerve-racking at times. Watching the last surviving member of your patrol try to track down the last remaining AI enemy preventing victory is as tense as it gets.The game is a first person WWII shooter with 3 countries to choose (British, American, German) and several game modes. There is Singleplayer, Multiplayer, and Cooperative. The Singleplayer experience is pretty awful. Played it for maybe 10 minutes before I gave up. Having human teammates makes a HUGE difference. The regular Multiplayer modes are just various forms of domination, but the twist is that capturing points adds waves of reinforcements to your team. This forces you to constantly need to capture points to keep your team alive. These game modes can go on for a long time as both teams can gain more reinforcements as they capture and recapture points.I mostly play the 8 player Cooperative game modes. I find them to be the most rewarding and difficult. Patrol, Stronghold, and Entrenchment are the three Cooperative game modes. Respawning in these modes usually comes in the form of capturing an objective or falling back to ""regroup"" with your teammates. Stronghold is by far the best mode, where the objective is to capture various points around the map. Capturing points respawns dead teammates. If you all die, you lose.Having a competent team is very important in this game. Friendly fire will kill allies, so throwing a grenade in a room with friendlies can spell disaster for your squad. You can die VERY easily, so you can't just run into a room and spray bullets everywhere expecting to come out unharmed. I've been headshotted by the AI more times than I'd like to admit. Being careful is the name of the game. Use smoke grenades as much as possible to conceil movement.The weapons are all WWII era, so we're talking bolt-action rifles, Thompson sub-machineguns, MP40 and MP44, MG42, pump-action shotgun, and even flamethrowers. Let's talk about flamethrowers for a second. If you see someone on your team with a flamethrower, stay away from them. As far away as you can get. Not only are they a teamkilling machine in the hands of some idiot, they are also liable to explode if shot. They have their moments, but overall they are just a giant liability to your team.This review is getting a little long and I'm hungry. There's a lot more I want to mention, but you can find out for yourself for the fair price of $20. The game certainly needs polish and adjustments to make it more balanced, but overall I love it. I can't wait for future updates with more maps, game modes, and new countries to play as. If you love WWII shooters, this game is for you.TLDR; I've seen more people die from their own flamethrower in this game than enemies killed by it 10/10"

SO much better than rising storm 2, if you care about that.the games hosts many types of maps, from the beaches of normandy, to the tight corridors and urban warfare of the greek city of crete, to the freezing cold and snowy fighting of bastogne.a big part of the game is the gore, which is pretty visceral. after an artillery strike wipes out a team, survivors can walk around in the aftermath to limbs and torsos strewn around the area. you can turn it off in the setttings (ALTHOUGH I THINK IT MAY BE OFF BY DEFAULT???)there's also a suppression system. when being shot a lot, your vision blurs greatly , making it hard to see.there are 4 main multiplayer gamemodes, as well as a few coop modes where 8 players fight against AI. i don't know much about coop since i never play it, but i've heard the AI is really good and it's a lot of fun!invasion- to me, this is the premier game mode and the best one hands down. 30 waves for the defenders, and 15 waves for the attackers. attackers have to capture every objective to reveal the location of the communications building, and they have to destroy the radios inside. once the attackers capture the objective to reveal this communication system, the defenders waves will go down to 0, regardless of how many waves they had.frontlines- 5 waves for both teams and both teams need to capture every objective in the map. they both start with two objectives, and must meet at the middle objective to fight. every time an objective is captured, it gives the team an extra wave. the last objective for both teams is a radio system in a building, and whatever team destroys it first, wins.liberation- 5 waves each, both teams start with no objectives captured. capturing an objective gives your team another wave. if a team holds all 3 objectives at the same time, they win.offensive- like a mini version of invasion. attackers start with 5 waves, defenders start with 15 waves. attackers have to make it to the defenders communications building and destroy the radios to win. the catch to this game mode is that the defenders need to send one person back to their spawn area to regroup and let everyone spawn in. if someone doesn't do this for a substantial amount of time, everyone will respawn automatically.there's a class based system that works really well. every class feels completely different. it's supplemented by the loadout supply system. you start out with 10 supply and are able to allot it however you want (more attachments on your gun instead of utility like smoke or grenades, etc etc). by securing an objective, you get 2 supply and every 5 kills you will get 1 supply.officer- one of the few classes able to wield an SMG, able to call in different kinds of artillery/air support depending on the faction. all 3 factions can call in artillery barrage which completely devastates a large area with multiple shells over a small period of time. then there's carpet bombing which calls in a plane that drops multiple bombs really quickly in a smaller area. you can also call in smoke barrage, which lets you place large amounts of smoke cover on an area. the last universal support is supply drop, which drops a supply crate for healing and ammo. the commonwealth has access to a typhoon strike, which is a surgical rocket strike into a really specific area. they also have access to an incendiary barrage, which drops in the same way as a smoke barrage, but instead of smoke, the shells contain white phosphorus that provides cover as well as burns the opposition. the americans have access to a surgical gun run, that sends multiple planes to strafe a small area with armor piercing rounds that easily cut through buildings and cover. finally, the germans have access to the stuka dive bomber, which calls in a stuka plane to drop one bunker busting bomb that penetrates any sort of cover.radioman- the radioman is as essential to winning the game as an officer is. without a radioman, the officer can't make any calls. the radioman usually has access to exclusive semi automatic rifle that no other class can use (m1 carbine for americans, gewehr for germans, and the ithaca shotgun for commonwealth, although the assault can also use the shotgun.) the radioman just has to hang out with the officer to be used for calls, so staying alive is a huge priority. if somehow your radio gets shot and you don't die, you'll need to resupply at a crate to get a new one.rifleman- standard class, germans and commonwealth get a bolt action rifle (kar98 and lee-enfield) while the americans get the semi automatic m1 garand. the german variant of this class is called the grenadier, which gets access to 2 grenades at the start instead of 1.assault- access to smgs, as well as a shotgun on the commonwealth side. able to run faster than every other class, which makes him extremely useful for rushing objectives. a lot of people don't realize this, but you can actually put a radio on your back as an assault which lets you be a radioman, while still being able to keep your assault speed and weapons. i do this all the time with my girlfriend since she loves the guns on the assault class.support- guns usually have low amount of ammo in clips, but are powerful and penetrate through pretty much anything. their guns consists of light machine guns like the FG42 and M1918 BAR.engineer- access to bolt action rifles and smgs (FOR 5 SUPPLY, WHICH IS A LOT FOR A GUN CONSIDERING THE♥♥♥♥♥♥THE ENGINEER HAS TO CARRY). the engineer is the only class that gets to use special explosives like rocket launchers, incendiary launchers and TNT. these explosives are essential to opening up shortcuts marked by walls that look cracked and about to collapse. these shortcuts are essential to capturing some points.machine gunner- commonwealth has access to the vickers, americans have the browning 30 cal, and the germans have the mg42. these guns are heavy machine guns that can not be shot from down the sights. it's recoil is crazy when you try to hipfire it, and you'll seldom hit anything. the point is to find a location where you can hunker down and deploy your bipod. the machine gun penetrates the most out of any gun in the game, and when deployed on its bipod, it's recoil is manageable and it shoots directly where you aim it, like a deadly laser beam. really useful for suppressing the enemy team as well as flushing out buildings.sniper- every game's gotta have one! equipped with bolt actions rifles and a 4x scope/7x scope depending on what you want. obviously good for long range.flamethrower- i don't have too much playtime on the flamethrower 'cause i suck at using it, but it's really good at flushing out enemies from buildings. OKAY I RAN OUT OF CHARACTERS."

Unbereable in that section a couple of months back when I bought it.I am one of those strange specimens that people see, wanting to play a multiplayer game, by myself, bots allow me to do that, partly I want to do it because I suck, partly because I feel the anonimity and competitiveness of the whole multiplayer concept behind games can transform even the greatest individuals into raging neanderthals.And yes... I haven't played a match of multiplayer, and yes I have only played a few matches in a single game mode for the bots, but even then i've noticed a great degree of improvement here, from what I saw, and played, before.I think it's perfectly acceptable to buy this game NOW, a couple of months ago the bots were incredibly difficult to beat, up to a point where I would call them ""broken"" and ""an unplayable mess"" but overall now the entirety of the game truly feels whole, as if the early access process and development actually is a concept that applies here, so I don't regret having waited out for the final release to post my opinion/review.I think is a nice game, I do not feel as if this is too much of a serious review (if even a little) but it has satisfied me.So there."

,Recommended,447820,24973303,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,Walton,"TLDR/Summary in the endPlays very similar to their other game, Insurgency. Pretty much the same minimalistic UI as Insurgency. Map design is usually good but not consistent, as in there are some areas of certain maps that is too easy to defend/too hard to push due a lack of a flank. Most of the time though there are multiple ways to get around the map and some more open maps like Dog Red allows some great long ranged flanks. Also there is a sense of imbalance with the weapon classes, mostly due to the 3 person limitation for the sniper position. Of course this is to stop people from going all as one class, but on some large maps it is very irritating not being able to change classes and snipe as the current ones on your team are too incompetent to counter those pesky machine gunners. The gunplay and the sounds are good, very similar to the quality seen in Insurgency. The optimization/performance of this game is pretty bad, I believe it runs on the same engine (Source) as Insurgency but it runs much worse in this game. Hopefully more optimization patches are included. The last personal gripe about this game is that there are few Australian servers. There are around 5 but people only go and fill up the first one, and no one bothers going on the other ones. This is most likely due to the relatively low playerbase here at the moment, but I do hope more people start to play.Summary - Some performance and balancing issues which may or may not be fixed in future updates, but the current game you get now is very worthwile if you liked Insurgency or WW2 games in general. Judging from the developer's previous game, Insurgency, I think it is unlikely for the devs to just run off with our money like the majority of other Early Access games on Steam. If you aren't gamed for the possibility of being dissapointed in the future, throw the game into your wishlist and see what happens in a few months time. By then it will probably be a better game overall."

76561198145271368,Recommended,447820,31024880,Posted: 8 April,all,Nasty,"One of the features that excites me about NWI games the most is that it is always such a challenge in the beginning and you get addicted to learning the maps and getting better. After playing ~2500+ hours of Insurgency, I was skeptical about whether they were able to bring back that level of excitement with Day of Infamy. I honestly thought it would be easy since it had the same feel and I figured my hours with Insurgency would give me an advantage. My first game I got destroyed by people rocking bolt action rifles using iron sights and I was shocked. You never realize how bad your aim really is until you have to kill multiple enemies up close with a lee enfiield. However, getting a kill with a bolt action rifle is one of the most satisfying things ever just because it takes so much time to line up your shots and the guns sound soooo friggin good.On the topic of sound, whoever was in charge did a fantastic job. Put on a nice pair of headphones, turn down player voice, crank the volume up, play invasion game mode on dog red. It feels like you're on omaha beach and it is immersive. The added waves and shorter respawn times makes for more action. Bullets are flying from every direction. Planes are in the sky dropping bombs or doing gun runs. Mechanical sounds of huge artillery guns are being fired off in the distance. Running through lots of explosions hoping not to get hit by a shell. And if you're lucky enough to make it up from the beach, you still run the risk of getting owned by a nazi with a flamethrower at the top. But it is very rewarding if you do end up schooling a bunch of people and capturing the objective.This game still has some of the quirks similar to what you would find with Insurgency. The characters still have hilarious quotes and grunts. It still has that hardcore, minimal hud style. There is even a greater emphasis on subtle details dictating the outcome of a firefight. NWI's attention to detail was extraordinary for Insurgency and they took it to the next level with this game. The gun sounds are not as easy to differentiate. You have to just guess who wins nearby firefights based on who sounded like they died. But if it is close gunfire only, you are forced to move more cautiously.I love all the new features added to this game but there are too many to cover in detail. Basically they added a melee system, impact grenades, shootable objectives, mulitple spawns (which alleviates the spawn camping problem with Insurgency), dismemberment, the ability to pick up and throw back live grenades, an officer/radio artillery system, saveable loadouts, and A FLAMETHROWER. The flames look so realistic it is amazing. In fact this game just looks better overall. And the surprising part is that it seems to run even more smoothly than Insurgency considering how many more features they have added.Cons:1) Clueless officers calling artillery on teammates. There is a ranking system that allows you to unlock certain playable teams and characters. I feel like people should be at least ranked as a Sergeant to have access to the officer class. There is nothing more frustrating than capturing an objective to 90% with like 4 other guys only to get decimated because some nut on your team decides to call a bombing run on the objective.2) The regroup system needs to be more balanced. The option to fall back and respawn your team usually ends up becoming available when it is too late. Almost everytime when the option to bring the team back becomes available, we lose the objective regardless of how good the team is. And if you're unlucky enough to get killed early on, sometimes you're stuck watching for the entire round because just enough players survive to prevent the regroup option from becoming available. Or you get stuck with that one guy who would rather sit around and snipe instead of revivng his team.3) Crashing to desktop is still a thing. It doesn't happen as often as it does with Insurgency but still happens on occasion. And it is still a buzzkill4) The loadout saving system is cool, but very buggy. Some classes don't save loadouts at all. Some classes save every detail except for certain attachments. And the text box used to name each loadout stops working if you don't type fast enough or if your mouse moves outside of it. It can get pretty annoying trying to save your loadouts but hey, it's better than not having a system I guess.Aside from the cons, I can highly recommend this game not just as a WWII game, but as an even more challenging fps shooter than Insurgency. It is worth every penny. But if you can't afford the 20 bucks, this game goes on sale pretty often and NWI is generous enough to offer it at prices as low as 2 bucks sometimes on steam or third party sites if you look around."

,Not Recommended,447820,26329110,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,(Ese) Watchtower,"A highly lethal feeling game, as if the devs combined Red Orchestra 2's weaponry mechanics with the addictive wave respawns of Day of Defeat gameplay, and tossed them a meat grinder.  The result is some truly great FPS mechanics that are tried and true.  Walk down a street at your own risk.  You will die, you will die horribly, and you will die horribly often.That is, until you run out of content to experience it on.Based on that, I can't recommend it yet.  That doesn't mean it's not a good game with good features.  It's just not enough new original content or concepts for what they are charging.  We have $9.99 worth of content for $20.00.32 max players also feels very limiting after playing Battlefield style games.  With so few players per team, even when a few people leave a server, it can be felt pretty quick.  I would've moved to Unreal Engine and shot for 64 players minimum.Pros:- Highly Lethal, good sounding and acting weaponry (are the cylce rates historical or copy & pasted for balance?)- No death messages add a certain fear you're not sure your target is down which is good- Artillery by Officer adds a good way to control territory- Fast paced, wave respawning gameplay- Great ragdoll effectsCons:- All the many, many, many limitations of the Source Engine, including player counts, lack of real-time lighting, poorly lit models, and all the same tired and recyled content from every other Source game they borrowed.- Can experience everything this game has to offer in less than 4 hours- Lack of maps.  The maps they do have feel are the same tired maps & content from Day of Defeat Source- Inconsistant quality areas in maps range from Gorgeous to Laziness, some Half-Life 2 looking areas on some.- Player Models can look out of place at times,- Player Situational Audio banter is repatative and can get a bit annoying, and same voice actor from DoD (sigh).  I dont like saying Fire-in-the-hole when I throw a grenade, it just gives away I'm there and about to throw one.Would you like to know more?This game is greatly held back by its limited map selection, and of which have the same tired feeling like I've played them before - because I have.   There's the beach map with the oversized novelty bunkers.  There's the standard DoD ""S"" style map with the bridge in the middle.The fact is this game is basing itself TOO MUCH off DoD, which is cool, if you create something new off the formula, and for long time DoD players you've played the maps so many times you can navigate through them blindfolded because they are either so similar looking and feeling they have no air of originality to them, even using many of DoD's props.  What was missing from DoD were bigger historically based maps with open terrain, and this game is too.This new update brings what looks to be a fairly unfinished port of Avalanche, and it is a microcosm of the game in its entirety.  Lots of good stuff mixed in with not so good stuff, mixed with we're just gonna port instead of bringing you something new and original.You look down one street and you think ""gorgeous"" then you walk in a room and you just go ""meh"".  The result is a mixed since of product polish and focus.  Interiors and destroyed walls are okay at best and in many areas just bad.  An actual new map would've been nice, instead the devs opt for a port, and look to their very small community for more maps with a contest.   Thats a red flag in my book and doesn't make me hopeful they are going to make this game grow in a timely fashion with new, refreshing concepts or original ideas.Because there is such a limited amount of maps, you can pretty much experience everything this game has to offer in a few hours, and I think unfortunetely the player count at this time reflects this.My best advise to the devs of this game if they are reading reviews is to create your own maps, that are completely and totally different from DoD style maps, because DoD veterans, likely your core audience, have already played the DoD maps for hundreds of hours (like Avalanche, even before it was on Source), and if we wanted to play them again, we'd load DoD.More larger, open, less linear maps with fields and hedges, arrange buildings in curves instead of 90 degree angles (less blocky), and go for more an open and realistic landscapes based off historical layouts and scenarios more akin Red Orchestra or CoD WaW.DOI is a very square, 90-degree blocky looking game needing much more custom modeling and props to separate it's look from previous Source based games.  Devs need to open up their history books and create something historical looking.Large, realistic maps are both possible and look great on Source.  Let the weapons breathe, we all know a thompson does good close quarters, let people  learn how to use the weaponry on a open battlefield where your weapon choice is going to play a much more significant role on the outcomes, where Artillery and Smoke can make a difference and provide cover for an advance.If I were in charge of this game, I would immediately move to an Eastern Front Development, get Russians in with a new original map, and expand on that, then look to the Pacific, and get this game a diverse set of maps, weapons and scenarios in a hurry.  Ports are not going to be enough to keep your player base active."

Not to mention this looks like just a mod or reskin for Insurgency...BUT SWEETBABYJESUS, I'm so glad I decided to give this game a try. It's so much more than just a mod for Insurgency. It has it's own set of mechanics and new and upgraded features: the sound design is awesome, there’re some very nice graphics effects, and the AI is improved and one of the best I've ever seen since FEAR making the coop a fun experience.I love the airstrike mechanic where you need a radio guy and a commander to call them, and you look up to the sky and see the bombers flying by and dropping bombs. Is so visceral and immersive. And when the enemy team calls for bombardments is such an adrenaline rush where you run for cover while bombs are dropping over your head.And every role and gun are fun to play and have their own characteristics. Some are bolt-action, semi automatic, full automatic and others need to be mounted to be properly used.Definitely a recommendation.

,Recommended,447820,34213655,Posted: 13 August,all,Arch Enemy,"This is the most addictive FPS of the year! Day of Infamy fuses two of the best war shooters in recent memory. Insurgency and Day of Defeat. It is the most gorgeous WW2 shooter you can purchase. It has perfect gunplay, with canonical weapons used during the second World War. You have a variety of classes and weaponry to choose from, each with their own perks that you can customize as you progress in the game. The map designs are great and players have huge battlefields to explore. The sound design is amazing! The weapons sound incredible and they are so satisfying to use. Once the artillery fire starts raining down, you will experience true horror. I highly recommend it!However, I do need to mention a few things. The AI is ridiculous. The enemy AI can shoot you from 200m with instant accuracy with no time for you to react. Other times they can be 10m away, but can't seem to pin point your location. They are capable of sneaking up on you like a goddamn hitman, but are blind as bats if you throw smoke at them. Your own AI allies are sometimes better than most players. Other times they will attack you and even teamkill you as if they were taken over by Skynet. There are still bugs that need to be patched. Grenades that float once you throw them, floating bayonet, gun shots sometimes get muted if you rapid fire, sudden random lag spikes.Because of the nature of the character movement in the game, I can't help but point out how substandard the hit detection feels. The game requires you to be careful and accurate with your shots, meaning you do have to get good and build skill so you can improve as a player. With that said, I find it silly how you can miss point blank shots just because the enemy moved a little to the left. This is especially noticeable when using a bolt-action rifle. You can literally dodge gunfire by jumping. For me this takes away from the realism the game tries to convey.Despite some of its flaws, Day of Infamy is still a fun, intense FPS that you should own if you love World War themed games. I hope the developers will add more maps and mods in the future because I can definitely see myself playing this game for years to come. If you already own Insurgency and Day of Defeat then I suggest waiting for a sale.See you on the battlefield!"

Over the years I have played a number of games some more than others especially RTCW ET and MOH more recently DOD-S. Having been a server admin and amateur modder this game for me IMO is off the charts. The gameplay is fantastic considering it is still in the Alpha testing stage, of course improvements to certain elements are needed but that's precisely why it's in Alpha testing. I cannot in all honesty comment too much on the Multiplayer as I have simply not played enough to make a informed review but I can talk about the cooperative mode. For the first time since ET I have found a game that engenders proper team focused play. The guys I have encountered are of the same mindset and always seem to play for the team. The modding community is fully invested and are busy and very active, from skins and sounds to maps and tutorials. As with most games on some forums you will find the usual negativity that all games are subject to. Also if you read all the reviews the not recommended ones seem to be all from players that only played for under a couple of hours, sadly spending more time writing a bad review that actually playing.But I can only speak from experience, the game is vibrant for an alpha test,the devs are responsive and involved, there are regular and numerous updates.

From the mediterranean locations such as Salerno, Sicily to snowy fields as Foy or Bastogne, the game never gets stale. Stronghold is the most fun game mode in co-op, you have to capture certain points or destroy fuel barrels/flak gun and at the end kill the officer. Entrenchment makes you defend your location and you can regroup as long as 1 guy is alive and you've got a point left to regroup from.

,Recommended,447820,32060234,Posted: 30 May,all,8sianDude,"Originally a mod from Insurgency, became a standalone WW2 tactical shooter game. Day of Infamy provides you the ability to play as either the Wehrmacht (Germans), Commonwealth (UK, AU) or US Army, with all types of weapons accurately distributed amongst the different militaries and classes. The damage models make the game intense as 1 round from a standard service rifle can easily down you, since there are no armor available for purchase unlike in Insurgency. Thus, tactical thinking and coordinating with your teammates is essential on winning the war against the opposition. If you're a big fan of tactical shooters like Insurgency, Day of Infamy is definitely worth the bang for your buck.Pros:- A lot of classes featuring different weapons in different military factions- ""Realistic"" damage models, encourages you to think tactically- Lots of maps and gamemodes both in coop or pvp- Unlockable weapons and playermodels through EXP earning and achievement unlockingCons:- Frame rate issues even on lowest graphical settings on low spec PCs, despite the game runs on Source engine.- Some of the achievements are bugged and won't unlock, even if you achieved the required kill counts.Overall rating: 9.5/10"

About 5mins later i ask him for some ammo, and as soon as he got up from his prone position in front of the stairs and walked by a window towards me, he got shot in the head. I was genuienly sad.

Haven't had this much fun in a World War II game in years."
,Recommended,447820,25876787,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,Gingahkrautzen,"Absolutely love this game.  Up until I bought this the only game I really played anymore was day of defeat source.  While this may be reminiscent of that, make no mistake this is not day of defeat.  The shooting, throwing the grenades, everything is much more up to the times and feels like it has much more of an punch, (I guess you can compare it to call of duty waw), but of course unlike call of duty you actually have to think before you shoot.  Spray and pray will get you killed 9/10.  Some nights it can be difficult to break an even score, other nights I get into a good spot and make all the right moves, check all my corners, pick the right classes on spawn and come out closer to the top.  Gameplay concept is basically capture or defend the flag in one direction, unlike DOD where the main gametype was a back and forth tug of war to see who could get all the flags first.  I'm sure more game types will evolve as it develops.  Reminder as I'm writing this the game is still in beta and so don't expect many maps, I think there are 6 or 7, all of which have still not lost their luster after 17hrs of play.  I still occasionally get turned around and lost, but the flag markers that overlay the screen usually point me back on track.  I can NOT WAIT to see custom maps being deployed on servers.  Of course there are a few gripes, but nothing too insane and overall it's well worth every penny of $20.  I can't think of all of the problems but here's what comes to mind immediately:negatives:-As if it's not hard enough to see where all your teammates are on screen, its even harder to find yourself quickly when you open the map because the only thing that seperates you from others is a box around you that is hard to see.  Hope they add some color to this soon.-I'll be leaning around a corner with my sights perfectly on the enemy and the gun gets too close to the wall or something and it pulls the gun back upwards causing me to miss my kill.  Similarly with things like the MG it becomes difficult to mount on a surface, sometimes you realize nomatter how you stand/crouch/laydown, even though there's a window that would otherwise indicate a perfect mounting location, the gun will not line up correctly.  Sometimes when I do get it in place, it's not anchored well and can be hard to control.  I don't know why this is, I'm still trying to figure out why it happens sometimes and not others.-crawling on my belly I tend to get stuck ALOT, even a small patch of rocks can keep me from moving forward and this has caused me to get shot multiple times.  I've also gotten stuck trying to jump out of windows.-This is more of a critisism on other players, but in order to send artillary and bomb out an area, you must be an officer and standing beside a player with a radio (usually somebody in the support class) and other players with radios do not want to play their class and follow you.  This can make or break a game and I find myself chasing radios around just to end up in an unsafe open location without a clear view to bomb an enemy territory, all because radio isn't interested in team work.  Of course if I bomb an area and kill the enemy, the radio person doesn't get credited for helping out.  I think if they changed that and gave them some kind of partial points maybe that would encourage better cooperation.-when pressing tab ingame, score does not show.  This is minor and probably a good thing when I think back to all the times I've been shot checking to see if I got a kill.  You only see your score inbetween lifes when you're waiting to respawn.-sometimes I'll switch weapons and they will not show up fully deployed, I'll have to switch back and forth a few times to get my weapon back.  Another downside to the game still being in testing & I'm sure it will be fixed.DONT LET ANY OF THAT DETER YOU, THIS IS STILL AN EXCELLENT GAME...GO GET IT!"

,Recommended,447820,24663311,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,wew lad,"Day of Infamy originated from a mod of a game called insurgency, and the developers of that game decided to make a standalone version(this game). Coming from the mod, I can say that this game is a huge improvement over the mod. This game requires teamwork and coordination, and especially so if you are on the attacking team. For example, you would need an officer and a guy operating a radio to stick together, so that the officer would call in artillery strikes. You need to have  your team smoke out the enemy base and cap with you if you want to win. The maps are well designed, some being close quarter combat maps such as Sicily, and other maps are long range sniping maps such as Bastogne. A con I have with this game is that the number of maps are quite limited. I see myself getting bored after a couple of hours of playing because there isnt that much maps yet. Keep in mind that this is in alpha, and they will probably add more maps later on as the game progresses forward. If you do get this game, consider playing with a friend. It is so much easier to play with someone who can watch your back and fight with you. Overall, this game is probably one of the best ww2 fps you can get today, and is definetly a successor to Day of Defeat and the mod.Edit: One thing I forgot to mention is that it is a bit unoptimized. I have an i3 4170 and gtx 970, yet I play on the lowest settings because gunfights drop my fps from 100+ to the 50's. I asked around and other people with better rigs than mine(..gtx 980 and i7's,etc) drop from 100+ fps to 50-60 fps in firefights. So if you have a 144hz monitor, dont expect to hit that 100+ fps in gunfights. I still would recommend this game though, it's off to a great start and patches will come out soon that will improve this game even more."

,Recommended,447820,32220143,Posted: 6 June,all,JG4_Karaya,"Day of Infamy is what happens when you take Insurgency's tactical, objective based gameplay and wrap a gritty and wartorn WWII environment around it. The addition of an officer class that may call in resupplies, artillery or air strikes as well as the ability of demolishing special parts of the map to gain easier access to certain points is a welcome enhancement. The weaponry includes your run of the mill WWII arsenal including some more exotic weapons such as the German FG42 rifle and Australian Owen MP. The game features a generous amount of gore with limbs torn off from explosions and people being burned to a crisp by the occasional flamethrower. Day of Infamy uses the same kind of supply system as Insurgency to limit what people can go into battle with while at the same time rewarding people for teamwork and playing the objectives. Overall a very well done take on WWII even if the Source engine is clearly showing its age."

Looks pretty good too. Its clearly designed for team-minded players, but its accessible to more casual players who just want to join a team for a round or two.Jump inro an online game and you find the teamwork rewarding, and easy to get into  with a nice enough (harmless, mostly) community, many faces from Insurgency, and steam workshop items including maps from day one.Its an easy and intuitive game to get started in, and its pretty obvious what's expected of you and where your objectives are in the round.Single player is useful for exploring the maps and classes, there is no ""campaign"" or story, just the online maps and game modes but with bots.

Whether you're wanting a long session, or to fill 30 mins in your day, this is a perfect game to jump into. It has great authenticity on design of the weapons and uniforms, and the maps are really fun to play, giving solid immersion which could result in you losing a few hours without realising time passed so quickly.You can work together to defeat a company of bots (which at the highest difficulty is very challenging as expected), or take part in PvP multiplayer, both offering a load of enjoyment.If you love WW2, and love games like DoD and RO, then absolutely buy this game, especially now since it just got a whole lot better on launch day! It was already a superb experience."

I do not think this is a terrible game, but it is a game that costs much more than Insurgency while changing almost nothing about Insurgency's core mechanics and gameplay loop, having less gamemodes, less variety in weapons and equipment, less mod support, a way smaller player base, and the same dated graphics and engine that Insurgency barely got away with years ago. If Day of Infamy had unique and interesting game mechanics that fit its theme (like Red Orchestra, or Day of Defeat, or Insurgency), everything else could be forgiven. It doesn't. Don't buy this game, and hope that New World learn from this mistake.P.S. I will edit this review as needed to reflect any major changes in the game. I don't expect I'll have to."

Crashes in particular seem to be extremely common now, with most of my sessions in game ending after about fifteen minutes with a crash to desktop, and a quick trip to the forums showing that this isn't an isolated issue.In addition, there are a number of balancing issues present as well. For instance: the U.S. bazooka has shot deviance at range while the German's equvalent is pinpoint accurate. There's no specific reason for it. Both of them used to be that accurate, they just nerfed one and forgot to nerf the other. Another example is a capture point on Crete that sits halfway inside the Allies' spawn protected zone, which prevents enemy players who enter it from using their weapons. This means that the Allied players can simply hold the point from inside the spawn protection indefinately. There's several more, but you get the idea.Hit detection issues also seem to crop up, with shots fired at an opponent at point blank sometimes taking up a half second to register the hit, or even not registering at all, regardless of the ping of both players.And as a minor complaint, some weapons have been removed on a map-by-map basis. While you're hard pressed to find a specific reason as to why, allegedly this was to add some form of historically accuracy, i.e. no STG44 on maps where the fighting took place prior to 1944. However, there are still plenty of anachronistic weapons, so doing so for that reason doesn't make much sense, especially given that the game is already light on equipment for the players as is.In all, the game still feels like it's in development. I dare say the decision to bring it out of early access was rushed. Most if not all of the issues I stated could have been addressed with a reasonable amount of playtesting, but it seems as though there just hasn't been enough playtesting done.To sum up, I might reccomend a buy if these issues are addressed, but as of now this still feels like a late beta."
,Recommended,447820,31828800,Posted: 18 May,all,starwarsman78,I enjoyed the insurgency Day of Infamy mod. I figured  I would enjoy the Day of Infamy standalone game. I can say I am heavily enjoying this game. The graphics are alright.The sounds in the game sound like their from insurgency like they just recycled a lot of the gun sounds which is kind of lazy imo. There are a lot of different factions you can play as which is a nice touch as well although it doesn't make much of difference. I heavily enjoy watching the reload animations for different guns like the M1 Garand and the tommy gun. I think in most games you don't notice the grenade throwing animation but I am one to notice and I never seen a throwing grenade animation look so good as I have in Insurgency and Day Of Infamy. I have no idea why but it's O so good to watch and hear. I think the Devs did a good job with this game. It's fustrating as times because you have no idea where the bullets came from or there's some guy hiding in a questionably dark corner camping with a flipping flamethrower and other times you are happy because you are doing good.Also the devs made some free dlc  like factions and more weapons which I like when a company does that. I will support that.It also is inspired of day of defeat so you enjoyed that game too you will enjoy this.I think I can compare this game to Rising Storm Red Orchestra 2 in terms of tactical gameplay except this game is a little more fast paced than RO2. But nevertheless still enjoyable.Although I do think this game needs some more maps. I think it gets a little boring playing the same 4 or 5 maps over and over again. If you liked insurgency then you should like this as well since it's just insurgency except world war two.

,Recommended,447820,32329541,Posted: 10 June,all,Big Z,"Day of Infamy is a highly engaging World War II multiplayer FPS by New World Interactive, the makers of Insurgency. The game plays similarly to the aforementioned, but there are many new mechanics which improve the experience. For example, the multiplayer classes are unique and interesting; officers can call in artillery strikes, machinegunners mow down enemies with a storm of bullets, and flamethrower troops can fill whole rooms with liquid fire.Gunplay is smooth and satisfying, with hit detection that works impeccably. Because most weapons kill in one or two shots, combat is snappy and intense. Grenades and other explosives have a wide kill radius and help to break up stalemates on the objectives. The weapons in the game are straight from World War II and are modeled quite well. The smoke grenades look very good compared to many other games (CS:GO for example) and using them properly is key to winning games. Voice acting in the game is amazing, and hearing a German officer yell for artillery or an American rifleman curse when reloading really adds to the immersion.Map design is, in my opinion, miles ahead of Insurgency. Not only do the maps feel more ""realistic"" in their design but they are also well balanced and fun to play, with plenty of room to maneuver. There are a variety of objective-based game modes, each with a different pacing and overall feel.The main drawbacks of this game are lackluster graphics and occasional technical issues, but in my opinion none of this detracts from the amazing gameplay experience.In conclusion: if you like Insurgency, multiplayer shooters, or World War II games in general, Day of Infamy should be considered essential. If you don't usually enjoy those things, Day of Infamy just might change your mind."

For myself, it's the true spiritual successor to the classic,Day of Defeat, and a testament to the dev team's ability to create and bring back games we love and remember, not only to give them life once again, but bring them back in keeping with our fond memory of and much better than the old (some older games just don't play as good and live up to what we remember, over time).

I have played the DOI Insurgency mod many times but this feels like a completely different game in my opinion. The gameplay and mechanics feel completely different from Insurgency. The realism with iron sights on all weapons apart from the sniper class makes the game more realistic and challenging at times especially on Dog Red map.For the people saying that it is just an Insurgency reskin have either barely played the game or are just terrible at it. New features such as the the squad leader role with the ability to call in artillery strikes if a teammate has a radio equipped make the game much improved and more teamwork involved. Its also early access too so you can expect much more features/maps adding into Day of Infamy in the next coming months.I was lucky enough to grab a copy of a closed alpha copy before release and you could see the new changes daily with each update. I was that satisfied with the closed alpha that I bought the game instantely the second it was released today.Hats off to the developers at the end of the day. They have been working on Day of Infamy for months (orginally as a mod) and they released a new solid multiplayer game with little to none errors on early access release.

With friendly fire and no death/hit/kill notifications, you find sometimes calling for a dead radio man or be the last man standing without noticing. Teamwork and communication are essential, and tension guaranteed when there's a long silence in defense.There's no music, it's absolutely not missing. The work done on equipment, weapon details and audio effects make a lot of games feel like a cartoon after playing this.Even death is still a shock sometimes, as you still see through the eyes of a dead man before vision fades...

It has common sense realism to it without making it stiff. For example, you don't have a bullet counter. In real life, you know how many bullets you have left in your magazine when the gun/rifle stops shooting. If you're prone next to a wall you can't pivot in a 360 degree circle - duh, you're next to a wall.I think it has the best AI I've ever seen - quite smart and fairly normal. Do they sometimes do stupid things like continue to run into a walled corner? yes. But they won't react unless you make noise or shoot at them. If you stay in one spot, they figure out that you're there and go after you. They are quite the challenge for sure!I like the range of classes you can choose (about 8 I think), but more importantly I like the limits on the numbers of in each of the classes. I can't stand an FPS that is basically a sniping FPS. I like the combined arms approach, as that is realistic. In a real-life Army squad/company, not everyone gets to carry a sniper rifle. Not everyone gets a Thompson SMG. Not everyone gets to call in Artillery strikes. I like the limits to the numbers of each class. There are plenty of classes to choose from.I think it is cool (alnong the same veins as Battlefield 2142) that an officer gets to call in arty stikes, smoke, bomber runs and dive-bombers/straffing runs, but needs to have a radioman nearby. Huh, that's how it is in real-life too!In real-life, there is a limit to how much gear one can take; so it is in this game. As much as I'd like to take extra ammo for my BAR a smoke grenade and a pistol, that doesn't work, so I'm forced to make some choices. The more gear you carry, the slower you move.The maps available, so far, are very well done (and recently reworked). Great variety within them.I've found that I love coop mode, as I like to play with my 3 sons together on one side. This game was their Christmas present from me this year  and we played for 7 hours on Christmas day together- one in Boston, 2 in Kansas City and me in Uganda, Africa. We had an absolute blast! Normal Multiplayer mode works well, as to be expected.I ilke the fact that the in game voice chat can be heard by anyone nearby. Huh, guess that works the same in real-life too.Graphics are great, and I'm running it on a MacBook Pro 2015 with only Intel Iris graphics. Sounds are great, and I'm using my Bose QuietComfort 35.Things I'd like to see:-no more crashing when changing servers (stable platform)-flame thrower not being stuck on the flamming graphics when already dead-Seperate sound effects volume control (one son can't hear the voices very well and would like to be able to turn down the sound effects-More maps for sure (I think there are around 8 currently-An eventual DLC for pacific-DLC for Italians, Russians / Africa-Fix the few quirks for the AI-Add an option for Medium difficulty for the AI (currently only easy and hard options)-Change the face, hair color, body size for the members of your side. It can be hard to distinguish people if you can't easily see their names.-Have a unique (or at least several) voices for your team members, again to distinguish who is who (yes, characters talk on their own, such as ""I'm reloading - cover me""I highly recommend Day of Infammy. If you are looking for an arcade only FPS, this ain't it. If you are looking for a common sense reality FPS that is a blast, this IS it.NOTE: This review is while the game just transitioned from Alpha to Beta Early Access, so I know the stability issues will be fixed prior to official realease (I hope so at least).~Hath"

,Recommended,447820,30784033,Posted: 27 March,all,Vanquish,"This game brings me back to the good old days of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and the original Call of Duty!There are classes which each have their own specific weapons and duties. Officers can call in artillery, smoke bombardment, strafing runs, and more. Radiomen enable the officers to call support in and without them the officers are just another grunt. Machine gunners can provide suppression while the rifleman do the heavy lifting (ie. dying).Battles become quite intense, and the tide can often be turned if there is a good officer and radioman providing support and directing the assault. When reinforcements run out its a battle to stay alive and prevent the enemy from gaining another supply of troops.Weapons are beautifully detailed and feel like they do a hefty amount of damage. There are not many attachments but the ones that do exist provide slight benefits. Slings allow for faster switching, bayonets increase melee damage, stripper clips speed up reloading bolt action rifles.If you have played Insurgency the gunplay in DoI is identical with a very realistic and weighty feel to the weapons. It is hard to describe just how good the weapons feel.Due to the game still being based on the Source engine its graphics are a little less detailed than many games released today however it does not detract from the game in the slightest. Smoke screens are blinding, flamethrowers are horrificly beautiful, and suppression causes your vision to blur forcing you to take cover and regain your composure.I heartily recommend this game to anyone looking for a realistic first person WW2 shooter with more modern gameplay."

This game is simply.. fantastisch camarade!Remember these very old ""Medal Of Honor"" games you used to play back in the early 2000? Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory?Back when gaming, the art of making an actual good game was still a thing? A cared products?Back then before all of the nasty, money greedy corporation ♥♥♥♥tards, busyness mans and their nasty decisions to please the mass for the only sake, the only quest of making a♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of money?Remember that era when games were made by gamers? For the gamers?Back when it was made for you to play & have fun for.. an extended period of time? Not just made to be merely enjoyable for only some weeks, months, until you forget it forever...Just, just so that they can shove you their next title up the throat, into an infinite loop of pure smelly♥♥♥♥♥♥Back when games would actually define their generation! Mark the minds for years! To give you an actual experience? To give you pleasure and a nostalgic feeling to come one day.Remember that time?Well friends.. This game picture perfectly the vibe I had when I was a kid playing these amazing, fun video games which actually introduced me, a lot of us to FPS.It is a very unique product, a very well made, fun game, which you can actually feel is being cared about, built for extended pleasure.Now for you, dear readers, which might been enough lucky to be born in the right generation, this game feels like a very good mix of the early ""Medal Of Honor"" and our almighty, beloved ""Return To Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory""!Now this game is definitely not your usual, casual game.So for that reason, I wouldn't not recommend it for the ""Casuals"" gamers, or more precisely, the impatient players.Although the game can be quite fast paced on some occasions, you'll need to be abit patient, use strategies in some others, have good judgents, momentum to do what is right on a given situation.But I highly recommend it to the true, and the old school gamers.It is not a game I personally see fitting for the mass at all, which are much, too much accustomed nowaday to all of the.. ''modern'' pieces of garbages, so called ""games"" we have seen since the last..  Maybe 10 years.Don't expect to go all ""CS: GO"" in that game, you'll get destroyed, ragequit, might spit a bit in both the chat, and the steam review before leaving.I see alot of crying, complains concerning the ''Hitbox''.Crying that the hitbox suck, that the game suck... While in reality, you just can't aim for♥♥♥♥♥♥and take the right decisions, son.Now i'd like to add concerning the ""Hitbox"", if you can aim, it work 90-100%% of the time.The only moment I'd consider the ""Hitbox"" to be tricky, is that alot of time, against prone targets on long distance, the shots might get very tricky to land properly!Another cause would of course be of ping issues, which can play a great role into a game into which you need to be so precise to kill an enemy.But again, if you can aim, it will work.I myself had some trouble early, until I adjusted my mouse sensitivity properly and got accoustumed to precisely aim on my targets, after that I now top the scoreboard most of the time.So make sure that you play with the settings abit to find the right, optimal setup for you.This is a game of team play.I'd even go has far to say it's very close to a War Simulation type of game.( I salute you ARMA players, you should like this...)Although now that I think about that twice, DOI is actually incredibly more fast paced of a game in comparison to ARMA, considering the map size.But you'll need to be clever, patient, swift, while remaining precise! You'll need to take proper decisions.Sometimes you might even have to go prone and advance slowly toward the enemy front line, while laying down, slowly... For 2/3/5minutes?And all that.. Just to get killed?Or to actually kill couples, to all of the enemy threats!Break their defences, frontlines, which will give your team the edge, the opportunity to push and capture a given location.In some situations it can be a more clever of a decision to do that, than to run in the middle of the field just to get killed, death after death... But you know, the total reverse situation can also be true.But I'm drifting away, so let's get back to the review!-The maps are all generally well balanced, well thoughts, very fun, I actually like all of them!I especially like the snowy types of maps, their color palette, their vibes... Remind me alot of the old WW games I used to play when I was kid.But be aware that some players tend to spam the same maps, which personally can get on my nerves. ( Crète, Bréville, Dunkerk )The Devs are also still updating and adding more maps right now as I write this review.-There's also a lot of cool success to make around, which also give in-game rewards!Such as different melee weapons, knives, trench tools, axes, different rifles wood skins, cloth wrap, all to show your prowess, skills, achievements of how of a fearsome soldier you are.-There is also a good, long lasting leveling system which can make you unlock different army units, with each different rarity has you level up!But you can also just buy them via the shop if you want, but I feel it then make the leveling pointless, so if you want a more, longer lasting fun, don't buy them!(  I feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ saying this though, because this game is really amazing, incredible for the dirt cheap price they sell it for all of our fun... The best FPS I played since longer than I can remember.They deserve much more than 20$ for such an amazing product! So I kind of feel like a bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ promoting you guys to not buy their in-game units skins.But! You can be always be a cool, good fellow and recommend this piece of art to all of your friends, family and even to your little sister.Lol, seriously. )-Another interesting feature is that the game is designed around an authentic voices system, for every nations!So American nation speak like Americans.Britishs got their very distinctive accents, and their funny expressions.While the Germans actually speak German! Its not like English with a German accent, If you know what I mean! Good way to learn abit of the German tongue.Another interesting feature is that the Mic.Chat, can be heard across the whole team! ( Nothing special).But it can also be heard by enemies, if they get couple of meters nearby! It can be used to lure enemies, or to taunt your nearby killed prays after killing them.I've have had some very funny moments I'll remember for a longtime from using the mic with enemies by both of these ways, I thought it was a cool feature worth letting you folks know about.So.. yeah! I think I touched most of the things you needed to know?The game is super gore, blood, decapitation from artilery strikes, carpet bombing, among others (Which are all actually called, coordinated by players inside the game playing the Officer Class, which is also dependant on another player class using the Radio to work), grenades, among others nice details?Highly modable by the community, sounds, weapons, maps, lots of stuff in the workshop to customise your experience with!But to conclude this nicely I'd like to add that the community is not toxic either, for now!Its not perfect, but less toxic then it can be on ""Insurgency"", the previous title of NWStudio, which ""Day Of Infamy"" is based on.Most of what I said here gameplay wise can also be applyed on ""Insurgency"" too, if ever you feel for a more modern type of era!Tho Imo, although I much, much, much prefer DOI, I really love to switch between the two titles once in a while because of their grand mutual diversity, while still sharing a similar type of amasing gunplay.I, We hope to see y'all on the battlefield soon, soldiers!"

Coming from the guys that made Insurgency, you know what to expect: a tactical team shooter with objectives. It can be brutal at the beginning, but map layout memorization and good communication with your team is the key to victory. It very much feels like what DOD:Source should have been.Pros:-Excellent gunplay-Versus modes and cooperative modes with relentless AI-Mod support-The guys at NWI show that they care about their product with new -and free- content updates-A progression system that does not feel obtrusive at all, with unlocks that do not affect gameplay whatsoever-It runs on a potato machineCons-It is a Source engine game. While its player models, physics and ragdolls are excellent, the environments and texture works really start to show their age, in particular the levels polygonal complexity.-Also being a Source game, the problems usually associated with that engine pop up here, as in inconsistent lag stutter, and random crashes when Alt-Tabbing.-While it's appreciated that the developers add new content, for free, the new Raid mode is kinda meh...Overall, I would give this game a 9/10, considering that I'm a huge WW2 buff, and I am not bothered that multiplayer games do not have a single player campaign. I would still give the upper edge to Red Orchestra 2. However, since the developers seem to have moved on to support Rising Storm 2, I would probably recommend this one now."

After all the futuristic games that have been coming out, it is great to have some WW2 action once again. Day of Infamy is a fun, immersive and realitstic tactical shooter. For those of you who play or have played Insurgency, this game is more or less a re-skinned version of that with added features and a variety of maps. Despite this fact, I would still recommend that you buy this game. Its fresh, its fun, and has a bright future ahead of it. NWI took all of the positives from the original mod and from Insurgency and made this great stand-alone.  There are some issues, as to be expected with an early access shooter, namely the imbalances on certain maps. On certain maps, it is just a pain to be one of the sides. For example, playing as the Americans on the Normandy Beach map is terrible. The Germans have many more respawns and are also in an incredibly defensible bunker. Now, the Americans can still win on this map, but it is extremely hard to do so. It confused me as to why the defending Germans had 2-3X the spawns as the U.S. did, as they were defending their bunkers and barely died compared to the U.S.. This being said, I stil think that the game is great as NWI will continue to develop this game and fix said issues. This game is quite fun and I will without a doubt continue to play it."

The graphics may not be ""top of the line"" but the gameplay definitely makes up for any of those shortcomings (I know for many people graphics may be the main deciding factor, but the immersion will take your mind off of the graphics right away.) This game brings back all the nostalgia from Day of Defeat 1.3 and Day of Defeat source, while also implementing unique mechanics similar to Insurgency without being a direct port that's simply just reskinned. By meshing all of these mechanics together alongside some (almost identical) map remakes from Day of Defeat - Day of Infamy creates its own unique feel, game environment, and game tempo that preserves the World War II shooter feel. The playerbase is just starting to grow with its official release, and I see a ton of room for growth and improvement in future updates (even though the gameplay is already great as is!)

,Recommended,447820,30987782,Posted: 6 April,all,KT_Extinction,"Day of Infamy is a great WW2 FPS that does more than enough to distinguish itself from being just an Insurgency reskin, although funnily enough I did enjoy the return of the M1911, MP40, and M1 Carbine from Insurgency in this game. I think in the next few years, due to the successful release of Battlefield 1 we will start to see more AAA developers returning to WW2, as a kind of rubber banding backwards from the over saturation of Modern, and now Futuristic shooters. However, I doubt any of them will be able to develop the same crisp, streamlined, and plain pure experience this game offers.DoI is often touted as a spiritual successor to Day of Defeat: Source since Valve can’t seem to get their head out of their♥♥♥♥♥and make any new games recently, but it actually felt pretty different to me. Day of Defeat: Source had people running around, wildly firing from the hip, and felt more arcade-like, while Day of Infamy has a slower paced, tactical feel to the combat, seeing how the tense room clearing mechanics of Insurgency absolutely apply here. It is somewhat jarring to lose the majority of the cool customization features and optical sights of Insurgency’s weapons, but it makes sense in the context of WW2 standard issue equipment. The addition of bayonets, viable bolt action rifles, and the ability to call in artillery definitely give it a different feel to Insurgency, and the excellent  varied maps, voice acting, and firearm mechanics sell the experience of WW2 from a first person perspective better than any game in recent memory, except maybe rivaled by Red Orchestra 2/ Rising Storm. They have really gotten the moment to moment experience of getting the feeling of shooting guns in video games down to an art form. Just bringing up ironsights with RMB, clicking LMB to pull the trigger, hearing the crack of gunfire, and watching the beautifully animated and authentic reloads of these weapons sets off all the right dopamine receptors in my brain. I could fire the guns in Insurgency or Day of Infamy all day and never get bored of just the “feeling” of using them, they are just so incredibly well done.There is a stronger emphasis in this game on teamwork as well. Squad Leaders can call in powerful fire support only if a radioman is nearby, so be prepared to get spammed repeatedly, “I NEED A RADIO OVER HERE!” by the in game chat. There are limited slots of faction locked classes/weapons just like in Insurgency, but this keeps the game from feeling like an STG44 filled bloodbath and more of a WW2 style FPS. Plus, the M1 Garand, Lee-Enfield, or Kar98k are often preferred in some of the wider, larger maps as they have excellent accuracy at long ranges, so don’t expect to see everyone running around with Thompsons or whatever. Like in Insurgency, expect to die in just a couple shots, so checking corners, leaning around cover, sticking with groups of teammates and using smoke grenades will still be your best chance for survival. The game has online coop just like Insurgency against AI bots, which is a great opportunity to practice and learn the maps with friends.I can whole heartedly recommend this game if you are a fan of WW2 shooters, or if you are a fan of Insurgency and want to see the formula in a WW2 setting. If you are unsure if you would enjoy Day of Infamy, I would recommend picking up Insurgency on its ridiculously cheap $3 sales (highway robbery if you ask me) and playing that game first to see if the more tactical, hardcore gameplay jives with you.Knowing NWI's track record with constant updates to Insurgency (like night maps, additional guns, visual indication of armor loadouts, etc.), I am certain we will see additional weapons, factions, and maps to Day of Infamy as well, and I can't wait to see what they add in next. I am personally hoping for Ostfront content, but as it stands Day of Infamy is absolutely worth every penny."

Day of Infamy is a VERY realistic World War 2 Shooter that makes the Source Engine look beautiful. In combat you can only take. 1-3 bullets before instantly dying. It isn't like other shooters where you can take a bunch of bullets with no problem. Teamwork is essential in this game and it's great how they incorporate certain classes being able to work together. There is a ranking system where the more XP you get the higher the rank. This game is incredibly fun, one of my favorite situations I've had in it so far was being the last member of my team having no more reinforcement waves. In order to get more I had to fully capture a point while I was being surrounded by a bunch of other enemy team members. I was crouched in the corner paranoid looking around shooting down anybody who went in. I finally captured the point to my surprise and thought that this game was indeed as awesome as people say it is.

It certainly arose as a mod for the latter game that developers New World Interactive decided to turn commercial, but it really ends up taking more from Insurgency and doing its own thing. You can probably tell from the Steam store page, but this is one of those games some people call ""hardcore"", being a realistic, teamwork-oriented multiplayer WWII FPS.It's certainly very visceral. Desperate yelling, loud gunfire, lots of explosions...even bombing runs. The Officer class can call in airborne support and artillery barrages in addition to giving out orders for the rest of the team, which makes the game a little like Transformice with guns. (No cheese though.) As it is visceral, so it is very satisfying whenever you catch enemies hanging around the wrong end of your gun. The voice acting is spot-on too, especially with different cosmetic units to play as.There is absolutely a learning curve, but fortunately the UI and bot intelligence are a little better than Insurgency's, & key rebinding is a godsend. Parts of the community can be toxic, given that this kind of game attracts those sorts of people - expect to hear slurs-that-some-people-still-don't-thunk-are-slurs and see player names cooked up by people who think being really rude advances society. Server admins on non-official servers are pretty on point about dealing with that stuff when it crops up, but it's still something to keep in mind. There's also a fair amount of nice players that counterbalances the *chan element, given that this game requires more maturity and thinking than the average Call of Duty.Overall, if you're in the mood for something tactical set in WWII, I quite recommend this."

But my god, still, its amazing. The Voices, the weapons, and the gameplay is all great to me. This is to me, Day of Defeat Source 2. It starts off slow, as you need to get used to the fact you are not rambo. I suggest practicing with bots, and once using the veteran bots, try out online. CO-Op is great aswell, sort of a Band of Brothers feel as you fight along side eachother. This game reminds me of Generation War, just because of how grafic, and how scared, some of the voices of the soldiers are. If you are shot at, you will scream in game, you will not think that running out against a MG is smart. The mechanics to be are amazing. I can't give this game enough praise. Its only in Beta but so many things are to come! I hope to see more additional units, as with the Commonwealth perhaps add a Polish Infantry corps, and for the Germans, perhaps a Cossak corps or a SS corps (Even though I despise the SS, would be fun to take them down a level and get to fight them.) While it has its ups, some small downs are the fact that it takes a good PC to run, and for me, I had to tone down all of the effects. Also, another down is the fact they added new divisions, but have them currently blocked out, sad, because you would be able to play as a German Paratrooper, or a American 101st or 82nd. The game is currently amazing and I suggest buying the beta, as you help out the devs and move the process of making it along. End review, great game, 9/10 due to the small things I said earlier, but still, god damn this is great."

Every major update has genuinely improved the game one way or another and it has made significant progress over time. The gameplay has realistic elements, like no crosshair, high-damage weapons, suppression effects, etc. while maintaining fast-paced but tactical gameplay thanks to the relatively small maps (compared to, say, Red Orchestra 2). All the weapons look, sound and feel authentic and satisfying to use and the voice acting is pretty good too (the Highlanders being a particular favourite of mine).People were intitially skeptical about paying for what already existed as a free mod for Insurgency, but when you see what the game has become since Alpha it can definitely be considered its own thing. Overall I am very impressed by this developer team and cannot wait to see what the full release looks like in the near future."

My favorite things about it are the intense sense of being in an actual firefight that I get. Bullets snap when they hit the dirt in front of you, or crack overhead. The suppression system is effective (your screen darkens, increases in contrast and blurs) and the sounds are terrifying.This might be morbid, but my favorite part about the game is the death animations. When you shoot an enemy, they drop, in their tracks. They don't fall down, like they're slowly dying (sometimes they do though) they drop and you can hear them gasping for air as their punctured lung struggles to inflate, then the slow gurgling as blood seeps from their mouth. When you die, the camera doesn't pull out and show your corpse, or show you a killcam, your camera rolls around like your head would if you had just been shot and lost all your limb functions from a hit to the spine. Occassionally, you look down to see the rounds hit your chest, which is insane.The worst, most terrifying way to die however...flamethrowers. They're not quite OP, but they're close. But when you're trying to cap a point, and then you hear that whooooshing noise, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Essentially, your entire screen goes red and you hear your hair raising screams as you cook to death before your enemy's feet. And it doesn't end quickly.10/10."

If you have played or are familiar with either of those titles then you should feel right at home with DoI.  There are many different game modes and maps that will more than likely be expanded in the future.  The game even includes a coop mode for those that do not want to engage other players in combat.  I also really like that the devs have included the British army and Italian maps as it seems those have really been missing in World War II games as of late.  Finally, they have also included a nice unlock system that allows you to obtain new units for each army to add flavor to the battle.I really have only two gripes, but they are minor in the grand scheme of things.  First the loadaout screen and UI feel a tad clunky after coming from Insurgency.  In their current state they are useable, but hopefully there will be options to change them in future updates or fixed with mods.  My second gripe is that the default German uniforms are just horrible and are not even close to looking like what the Wehrmacht soldiers wore in combat.  I know that the devs have to be careful to not fall afoul of laws in various countries that prohibit showing Nazi symbols, but they should be able to do this and at least keep the uniforms close to what they looked like.  Luckly there are mods that address this issue more or less, but I still feel the devs should consider redoing the German uniforms to be a tad more realistic considering most of the other armies in the game look well reseached.  Again, both gripes are minor and really come down to my personal preference."

Whether you are fighting for the U.S. Army, Commonwealth Forces or the German Wehrmacht, there is a vast arsenal of over 30 weapons. DoI is a  highly strategic experience that rewards intelligent maneuvering and coordination with your team. Pay close attention to your surroundings, as blindly running into an open area is the easiest way to be killed. Lean around corners, lay prone to steady your aim, and walk slowly to conceal your footsteps - these are effective strategies to stay alive.

The learning curve is really unforgiving and new players should be prepared to die often and quickly at the hands of experienced players.

If you run and gun, chances are you will die. If you move when necessary, pick your spots well, and work with your team, then you will succeed. I've put in a little over a hundred hours, and I've gotten fairly good, but I still get my butt whooped by people who are more skilled.The devs are a pretty small team from what I understand, and they're pretty awesome with the community. They really pay attention to player feedback. In fact, this game itself was actually a total conversion mod for Insurgency, and the devs decided to turn it into a full game because they liked it and the community did as well. I started playing this when it was still a mod, so I've seen it through the cycle of Alpha and Beta testing, and I can say that these guys really watch what the community says.All in all, I absolutely recommend this game.

,Recommended,447820,30685965,Posted: 23 March,all,Gwailin,"Day Of Infamy ReviewLet me start by saying that this game is - at least in my opinion - far better than Insurgency. Something about the small, well made maps and most of the players having a rifle makes for amazing gameplay.Teamwork and communication is vital to gaining victory. Be careful when you speak though, as the enemy can also hear, if close enough!From storming the beaches of Normandy, keeping your head down in the snowy trenches of Bastogne, and fighting in the sunlit streets of Italy and Greece, this game has it all. Whilst you are skirmishing with the enemy, your officers (in conjunction with radio operators) will call fire support in the form of smoke and HE artillery barrages, spitfire gun-runs, bombings, and more.There are also tactical destructible elements to the game. This element consists of destructible walls, that, when destroyed by the demolitions class, will allow your team to move freely to another area of a map that previously they might have been restricted from. This can lead to flanking tactics not seen in Insurgency and most other shooters. All throughout my hours of play, I have not noticed any weapons being over-powered in any way, as each weapon serves a purpose and has a weakness.The one area this game does not do so well on is the graphics and movement. Because this game runs on Source, the movement can often be a bit fumbly, and thus gets you stuck on walls, corners, ect. Then there is the graphics. The graphics aren't bad, or ugly, but they certainly aren't great, though they serve their purpose well. Low resolution terrain textures and generally grainy textures caused by the source engine starts to show the engine's age, but so long as you can ignore that, the game can still be fairly pretty.Overall this is one of my favourite games, and I would give it a strong8/10for the team play, polished shooting, fantastic maps and map design, and reasonable price (UK £14.99/US $19.99 as of the writing of this review) .Thank you for reading."

Do you remember how awesome WW2 games in general were? Do you ever tire of this endless wave of heartless, soulless modern shooters where you bounce around the map spraying and praying, often with some kind of wallhack built in to the game so you can always see where enemies are?Do you long for a return to the good old days of classic WW2 shooters? Well, buy Day of Infamy because that's exactly what it is. The maps are great, the game modes are great, the weapons sound vicious and authentic, it's tense. It's great!-----------------------I would just like to edit this review after playing the game for maybe 10 hours (I previously wrote the review after only playing for maybe 1 hour) - it's even better than I first thought. Seriously, once you spend a few hours familiarising yourself with how the game works properly, and you become a little confident in the layout of the maps (particularly important is knowing where to throw smoke grenades to conceal your movement when on the attacking team) you can really start to enjoy DoI even more.I promise if you used to love games like Medal of Honor: Allied Assault back in 2001 or whenever it was, you're going to get that same feeling here.

Only being in Beta at its current state,  I can't even imagine what a masterpiece this game will become at final release. Unlike other WWII games, such as Battlefield 1 or Day of Defeat, Day of Infamy has its own side of WWII. The gore is what really makes this game itself. The aiming system is the best of any shooter i've played. The brutal effects of explosives are taken into account, which gives ""take cover!"" a whole new meaning. Teamwork is something that is needed to do anything, you cant go at an objective alone. With only 70 hours of playtime and more to come, I would totally reccomend this game to anyone looking for a fun, but difficult shooter."

And unlike those MMOFPS shooters, you don't have to grind to get any weapons, no microtransactions.I've played lots of Heroes and Generals, which is free to play and has tanks, planes, turrets, and other vehicles, but is crippled by the need to grind ingame cash to buy weapons and repair the ones you have, and grind objectives and kills to unlock upgrades and weapons.  Day of Infamy has one price, and you get to fire every single gun in the game, go on any map you want (community or official), host your own servers, and can mod the game easily with the steam workshop - whether you want more menu music, retextured weapons, memes, or better iron sights."

This is how early access games should go, these devs have done a great job and that alone means you should buy this game. The game is a lot of fun, it has a co-op mode where you fight the AI which can be really tough at times and means you have to work as a team! You can play as any of the factions which I love for the co-op, no longer can I only kill Germans but I can be one and fight those dirty Amerikans and Brits off. The Multiplayer is also really good! You'll find good team work and heavy and I mean heavy fighting will happen all the time. you'll see your friends blow up right infront of you while their legs go flying away. This game brings you into the ww2 setting and I completely buy it.The game on release has skins for each faction, for example for the British there's a Canadian skin, since I'm Canadian this makes me very happy and the skins look different and have new voices which is awesome! This game can only keep on improving.I'll list some kinda bad things but they're not game breaking at all and shouldn't stop you from buying the game.-The regular amerikan voices are just so annoying and whinny, it also doesn't help that people will spam certain talk keys so their characters voice will just keep on going on and on.-Only 10 maps which is good not bad let me say that but I feel that if this game wants to live on they should add more maps to the game to keep things fresh, I would love to see some North African maps. That way I can get my lovely Afrikan corps!-This one isn't a bad thing but something I want and I think others want too and that's ITALY!. We need another Axis faction and I think italy fits perfectly here, they can open up the african front and they will add new weapons that most players don't know about. I think it'll make things a lot better than just Germany on the Axis like always. The Italians never get done and I think this game has a good chance to add them and make them interesting to play!For the price of 22$ this game is completely worth it. If it's on a sale you have to buy it right away, there's no reason not too!"

Yes it is built on the Source engine and is host to many of the bugs that can be found in source games. However, it also has one of the best communities. Realism units are building up an incredibly well regulated community that is nurturing and welcoming to new players. The game recieves regular updates which include new maps, units, and gun customization. NWI is doing a lot of work on this title to fix all the kinks and strangeness. All in all I can recommend this game highly.Pros:- Fast paced unforgiving gameplay.- No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t unlocks. Units are RNG and have no affect on the game and gun skins are unlocked through playing the game not by being a Wallet Warrior.- Maps are varied and have been coming out pretty quickly in the past few months.- All weapons are available from the beginning. Level playing field that rewards skilled shooting.Cons:- NWI prioritizes their servers. If you want to find a community server that has Moderators and custom items you'll have to look for them.- Co-Op is impossible Solo.

76561198063231653,Recommended,447820,30742806,Posted: 25 March,all,503_OVERLOADED,"Day of Infamy is a highly engaging World War II multiplayer FPS by New World Interactive, the makers of Insurgency. The game plays similarly to the aforementioned, but there are many new mechanics which improve the experience. For example, the multiplayer classes are unique and interesting; officers can call in artillery strikes, machinegunners mow down enemies with a storm of bullets, and flamethrower troops can fill whole rooms with liquid fire.Gunplay is smooth and satisfying, with hit detection that works impeccably. Because most weapons kill in one or two shots, combat is snappy and intense. Grenades and other explosives have a wide kill radius and help to break up stalemates on the objectives. The weapons in the game are straight from World War II and are modeled quite well. The smoke grenades look very good compared to many other games (CS:GO for example) and using them properly is key to winning games. Voice acting in the game is amazing, and hearing a German officer yell for artillery or an American rifleman curse when reloading really adds to the immersion.Map design is, in my opinion, miles ahead of Insurgency. Not only do the maps feel more ""realistic"" in their design but they are also well balanced and fun to play, with plenty of room to maneuver. There are a variety of objective-based game modes, each with a different pacing and overall feel.The main drawbacks of this game are lackluster graphics and occasional technical issues, but in my opinion none of this detracts from the amazing gameplay experience.In conclusion: if you like Insurgency, multiplayer shooters, or World War II games in general, Day of Infamy should be considered essential. If you don't usually enjoy those things, Day of Infamy just might change your mind."

It is essentially another FPS WWII shooter with a slightly more ""hardcore"" edge than Call of Duty and whatnot though its mechanics are still ultimately very gamey so don't expect milli-sim levels of detail.While I do compare Day of Infamy to Day of Defeat it is at its core a re-skinned Insurgency.  It runs by the same ballistic system, the same spawn system, movement system and same equipment upgrade system. For fans of Insurgency I imagine this will be easy to settle into and get a grip on taking the same flaws and strengths as its parent game. Level design and atmosphere wise it is more reminiscent of Day of Defeat, possibly due to the larger number of Italy based maps compared to it's competition and also with its much stronger focus on CQC fighting. As this is the old source engine put through a good bit of pushing it has a lot of limitations in draw distance and detail. Also due to the ballistics being very simple hitscan / direct hitting projectiles the game is impeded by its predecessor. A good example of the draw distance in play is the Omaha map where the bunkers cannot be seen from the shore. This may also be a balancing factor, but it does feel very 2005 in many ways.Enough about the dispassionate distance! How do I feel about Day of Infamy?In all honesty I don't feel it delivers that great an experience. While it is very tight and tense, it also inherits far too much from Insurgency and that with the setting's context ends up feeling a bit flat. Insurgency worked well due to the modern setting. The battles were small scale skirmishes that I can picture a lot of Middle Eastern conflicts to be like, plus the modern equipment gives the more simplistic mechanics their edge. Day of Infamy is based on the largest conflict the world has ever known and while I can picture small skirmishes breaking out, it lacks the scale and chaos the theatre deserves.I will admit I am somewhat bias due to a large number of hours being poured into the Red Orchestra / Rising Storm series (pick either, though RO1 gets my vote) and a few other large scale games here and there. Going from huge scale, combined arms battles to what is mostly small scale fights with the more limiting systems from Insurgancy's spawn mechanics (which, again, work for Insurgency) deprive it the feeling of mass scale chaos that WWII largely gave, but as said, personal bias.Do I advise Day of Infamy? Maybe, though it depends on the context of what you want.Huge battlefields with everything and the kitchen sink? Try something else like Red Orchestra or any of the upcoming Squad mods.Milli-sim? Arma or Squad.Day of Defeat sequel? Maybe, but Red Orchestra still delivers better.Insurgency in WWII? Sure, not sure why but sure.Do I like it? No, even if it left Early Access with all the placeholders fixed and more modes added. It just does not feel like it has the context in line with the war in question."

,Not Recommended,447820,24702463,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Obelisk,"Disclaimer: this is a review of the game in its current state. I also made this review at one in the morning after I got salty from being constantly killed.Summary+Cool concept+Nice animations+Enjoyable and unique radio system-Poorly optimized, but I've gotta put the blame on the 20 year old source engine that it's built on. Then again it's the devs fault for making the game on it, but whatever.-Half the time you have NO IDEA where you got killed from. One second you leave spawn the next you're on the floor dead, making it really hard to learn maps and where people like to camp.-Some guns are garbage-Maps are one-sidedOverviewDay of Infamy is a highly realistic FPS game set in WW2. If you've played Insurgency, it's basically that but with different guns, maps, and a few additional mechanics. Each map is a depiction of actual battles that took place during WW2 as you play as one of three factions, each with their own unique guns which are, as you guessed, also realistic depictions.The game certainly has its peaks, and being held up in a trench while artillery strikes land next to you and your comrades are being shred to bits with machine gun fire is truly incredible and fun in its own dark way. The concept of being able to fight in D-Day as an American soldier is astonishing. However, let me go into detail for why I didn't recommend this game.The GunsThe guns in the game do look cool and the animations certainly are nice, but it seems like the devs put more work into making the guns realistic than actually balancing them and seeing how they worked in-game. Each faction has guns you absolutely should not use, some guns are absolutely rediculously overpowered in certain scenarios, and others are utter trash and don't even deserve a spot in the game. Every class except the Flamethrower (Engineer)and Rifler class are either overpowered or just ""okay"" so I won't go into detail about them.Flamethrower (Engineer) Class+Has assault weapons+Has rocket launcher+Can use a badass looking flamethrower-Flamethrower is absolutely garbage except in a few, very specific situations. It is INSANELY easy to kill yourself with it because you can't be too close to the enemy or you'll catch yourself on fire and you can't be too far away or you won't hit him. You're probably going to die anyway because if you shoot it while walking forwards you magically burn yourself, and you also can't be near any walls or obstructions or you'll also accidentally burn yourself. Oh and if someone shoots the tank on your back you blow up, effectively killing yourself and anyone in a five meter radius around you.-The rocket launcher is way too inaccurate to hit anything 40+ meters away. Also, anything closer and you're probably going to either accidentally kill yourself or kill one of your own teammates.The Rifler Class+Can call in smoke or regular artillery+Caps points faster-Normal artillery a quarter of the time gets called in on an accidental spot, resulting in countless teamkills and teamdamage.-The rifles SUCK. They're supposed to be used for medium engagements but the iron sights are near impossible to use.-This class is basically outclassed by every class.The MapsThe concept of fighting in real WW2 battles is neat, but when you realise those battles were one-sided, then it isn't as fun anymore.+Concept is cool+Mowing down Americans on D-Day is fun-Almost all Offensive (basically push the defenders back by capturing points) maps are HEAVILY one-sided due to the defending team getting height advantages, better cover, and basically everything that you don't want in a balanced game.-Maps don't switch sides after each round for some reason. For example, if we're getting pummelled on the U.S. side for one round we have to endure it for a second round instead of switching sides to the German team."

,Recommended,447820,32013361,Posted: 27 May,all,Alloyed Clavicle,"One of the first things I usually bring up when talking about FPS games with friends and other folks is the idea that I'm ""not a real big fan of shooters."" That is, of course, a highly general assertion. After spending more time in and around the genre, I learned that I'm really not a big fan of challenging solo campaigns, or the generally mediocre writing that goes into their story. What I do like are co-op modes. Left4Dead and Left4Dead2 are my old go to examples of this done well. In only a handful of weeks however, first Insurgency and now Day of Infamy have firmly supplanted them.When I was young, I was all about the Game Shark. Cheated like mad at everything I could. I ran custom versions of rules.ini in Red Alert, had an invulnerable team in Chrono Trigger, and spent a lot of time swimming on the shore of Cinnabar Island for Rare Candy duplication in Pokemon Red. For the longest time, I considered things like ""challenge"" and ""difficulty"" to be roadblocks to my fun.All of that changed recently. For the most part is has been tied to having a good core of people to team up with for cooperative play. That's a big help. Even without them, my experience so far with the DOI co-op servers has been almost universally positive.If I had to pick three words to describe Day of Infamy, they would be Brutal, Unforgiving,  and Indiscriminate. To date, I have not joined in on any of the PvP action the game offers, but I expect the real players to be all three of these at least as much as the boots, if not more so.There is a whole lot of chaos going on just about every moment in a typical co-op match. People are yelling, overlapping one another. Guns are firing everywhere, the Earth shakes with explosions as the roar of artillery drowns out everything else. Meanwhile the other team is still trying to kill you and is rather likely to succeed.Maps are varied, modes are many, and mistakes are used against you immediately. This game is hard, and I love it for that."

Day of Infamy is a semi-realistic WW2 Shooter that is reliant on Teamwork between Officers and Soldiers to get what you want, which is usually to clear the area of enemies, whilst taking objectives, whether your are securing the Bakery on Salerno, or destroying the Radio on Dog Red. The Weapons you have at your disposal are (mostly) historically accurate and effective when used properally, Flamethrowers are used at close range or for area denial. Sniper Rifles are ideal to killing Officers before they call an artillary stirke or just key targets in general. Sub Machine Guns allow for close to mid-range combat, and Carbines make it easier to take someone down in 1 shot to the chest or up, and of course, you have your trusty handguns as a backup. Friendly Fire is also enabled, so be careful that you know who's who. Overall. I got more then what I expected from NWI and vastly recommend this game to peers and strangers alike."

It plays like Insurgency, but with hints of Day of Defeat and it's exactly how I like it.The game is a bit bare-bones at the moment. Five maps at the time of this review that are still going through art passes. There are some bugs, but it does run rather smoothly and hasn't crashed on me yet. Balance is off for certain aspects, but will be sorted in time.The Officer needing a radio man to call in artillery is a wonderful game mechanic that inspires cooperation in the team. Smoke arty and smoke grenades are so important in this game, and I love it's inclusion. I wish there was a bit of a visual representation of where your arty is actually landing as it's not very clear and can sometimes cause accidental misfires that hurt your own team.Some sort of timer to let you know when arty is available to be fired again would also be welcomed. I'd love to be able to look at a wrist watch or something to keep within the immursion of the game world rather than a timer in the HUD, but something would be better than nothing.Ultimately, this game is in Early Access, but the devs have so much good will built up from how they run and develop for Insurgency, that I have full confidence when this game reaches version 1.0, it will be a phenominal game. After a month from it's intial release and just surpassing my 40th hour of gameplay, I am very satisfied with the game in it's current state and I'm looking forward to see how this game develops, as it is quickly becoming a favourite already."

World War II shooters had a major surgence of popularity in the early 2000's with timeless classics such as Day of Defeat, Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, and the original Battlefield 1942. World War II dominated the fps market and eventually we saw its demise from the battlefields of Europe to a more modern setting to the far fetched future. World War II seemed all but history both in the physical world and in the fps market. However thanks to extremely talented modders and developers we have seen World War II games rising up agin with the same formula as before and even some new ideas. Along comes this gem, Day of Infamy, which was originally a mod for Insurgency, which was a mod for Half Life and other Valve source engine games. I bought the game the day it was released into early access thinking: ""World War II Insurgency? Sure i'll give it a try.""

Officers can call in different types of support these range from CAS, Artillery and standard support such as ammo or smoke cover. While this might seem like a small change to the formula this support is the key to winning battles.Day of Infamy also uses many effects to immerse the player in the chaos of battle such as gore, suppression, lighting and partical effects, but it does in such a way that doesn't overburdens the player nor decrease FPS.The game also supports steamwork shop support meaning that maps and other mods will be easy download.Overall:While Day of Infamy might not reinvent the tactical shooter genre it brings enough the party to keeps things fresh and exciting the setting alone might be worth the purchase, while world war 2 shooters are now re emerging as a want in the shooter market most are re-imaginings of more arcadey games (Battalion 1944, Days of war) they are a long way off being finished.8.9/10"

Brought to us by the diligent hands of New World Interactive, Day of Infamy is a love letter to World War 2 fans everywhere.

I've been playing it since it was a mod and it has only gotten better over time. For twenty U.S. Dollars it, like Insurgency before it, has given me much more enjoyment and longevity than many 60 dollar tripple-A shooters. And of course, being a history buff and a WWII enthusiast, the game is a nice crossways between my hobbies of enjoying history and playing video games.Day of infamy provides challenging, yet simple, gameplay, which few games have mastered. I have hundreds of hours in Insurgency and intend to put many into Day of Infamy. Having said that, the game has a few shortcomings, mostly with its graphical glitches. Most of them are purely asthetic, but a few have interrupted game flow, some by rendering a few walls see-through and some blocking a portion of my view with a strange stretching glitch. The game does run on the aging source engine, but for the most part, assuming you have a decent computer or reduce some of the graphical settings, you should have no problems running Day of Infamy. I cannot endorse this game enough and am very excited to see where the Indie developer New World Interactive will take us next."

,Recommended,447820,30694517,Posted: 23 March,all,Vög,"Day of Infamy is an excellent tactical shooter in the vein of Insurgency and Red Orchestra. Looking back at it's roots, DoI feels like a strong evolution on Day of Defeat's formula. It's not just the Western Front setting, close quarters urban fighting but also the large focus on teamplay. The radio operator/officer mechanic is great and probably the biggest addition in gameplay from the baseline of Insurgency. A team with a good radioman and commanding officer can keep the bombs and shells falling on enemy positions, providing a huge advantage. It's really satisfying to pull off a well placed and timed carpet bombing strike. They nailed the atmosphere and the sound design is very immersive. The gore system is awesome at amping up the shock value of a high explosive kill and also gives the battlefield a horrific atmosphere. It's going to be cool to see what the modding community will do with this game. Definitely worth the buy if you were a fan of DoD, CoD 1 &2  or MoH Allied Assault back in the day."
,Recommended,447820,30707714,Posted: 24 March,all,w1zard,"amazing game. all the guns feel really good and the spawning system is the best i have ever seen in an online shooter because it makes your life matter.each team is given a certain amount of waves to either capture or defend an area, if you fail to capture/defend the area and expend all your waves, you lose. this is good for a few reasons, firstly, it makes your life actually matter. not killing the enemy is severely detrimental to your team as it comes down to who kills each other the most wins. because of the wave feature too, you could find yourself waiting upwards of a minute to respawn, possibly more, depending on the game mode. the point is, you want to die as little as possible, which adds realism because you're going to try not to just run in and get instantly shot, like you would in Day of Defeat.Clear successor to Day of Defeat and improves on it in every way possible.The game has an amazing gibs feature too, which is always nice.There are only a couple of ways this game could be better.One is if they added more fronts, such as Eastern front, African front, etc. Right now its limited to the western front and italian fronts. Though Italian troops do not appear in game (as far as I know)Two, and it's probably impossible due to source engine would be destructable enviornments.Highly recommended 9.5/10"

You will be hard pressed to find a game nowadays that canthrill you into a heart pounding dread, as you attempt to capture the last point being the finalremaining player on your team against multiple enemies.The height of tension reached in certain situations is only surpassed by the smug satisfactionthat can by achieved by incredible acts of valour and skill.If you want to play a game that gives you the chance to be a hero in front of a captive team of slain onlookers, this is the game for you.As with anything there is always room for critique, I would have hoped for another handful of maps on release - but you can rest assured that this type of content will be coming in the future.Also the game does buy into the modern cliché of progression and unlocks - but it does so in a measured and sensible way.I give Day of Infamy a big thumbs up."

76561198002053619,Recommended,447820,30765040,Posted: 26 March,all,Klavs,"Quite refreshing take on World War II close quarters combat.There is only infantry combat available. No tanks, no vehicles, etc.Character customisation is not as detailed as I was expecting: You have default unit and You can unlock other units within Your army for You to play. When You select a map to play You can change to play as a default unit (skin) or use any other unit You have. Different units will slightly alter Your appearance and that's all. Selected unit (skin) will not alter Your loadout options in any way (or at least I havn't seen that).You earn experience and rise Your rank as long as You play in multiplayer (not sure about coop). When You level up in rank You might be able to recieve that custom option to play with a skin of different unit later. Experience, rank and earned skins are only things that are persistent in this game. Anyhting else seems to reset to defaults before each battle.Your weapon and equipment selection is limited to Your ""supply points"". You start with 10 points before each battle and as You kill more enemies or accomplish mission objectives, You earn more supply points. You can use those points to alter Your loadout, when You respawn during battle. There are certain, rare weapons or item combinations that are not available to You unless You earn more supply points. This mechanic effectively represents that skilled warriors had a better chance to get rare equipment.Some items require zero supply points for Your class - like a binoculars for a team leader or radio for radioman while other classes might need to use supply points to add those items to their loadout.Squad leaders can call in artillery or air support, but only if there is a radioman (or any other unit with radio in a backpack slot) Leaders also can call for supply crates.You can pick up weapons on the battlefield but You are limited to one clip or magazine of ammo unless Your other weapon uses the very same ammunition. But if You run back to Your supply crate, You can replenish munition for You weapon as much as You like.You can not customize weapons You pick up on the battlefield. But when You choose a weapon in your class loadout You can add some extra features, like scope, sling, larger magazine and some other options. These options are fairly realistic and represent actual accessories.There are only few maps to play on but they are well made and each can be played in multiplayer, or against bots in single player (practice mode) or coop.Different class mechanics really encourage cooperation and teamwork.Another interesting feature that adds realistic feel to the game is that You, Your team mates and also Your enemies will speak a lot when they are in certain situation. This chatter can be heard by everyone who is nearby or behind the wall. That way You can tell that enemies are close. Enemy radio can be heard also, I believe if You are close enaugh to enemy radioman.Among all other WW2 FPS games this stands out with a bit aged but decent graphics and a set of gameplay mechanics that add quite a realistic feel to it."

,Recommended,447820,31733814,Posted: 13 May,all,Classy^^,"Day of Infamy is a very tricky game, it is after all a tactical shooter: one shot can and probably will kill you. Because of this it is rather slow paced and each kill you make feels very rewarding. However, the game mentions that teamwork is very rewarding which it really is but I don't see them implementing many features which really makes the players want to work together. Source Engine is known for its horrlbe audio codec system and it makes voice chatting in-game unpleasant. I am also missing a squad system; you cannot expect the whole team to cooperate, it is better to split it up in multiple squads and give each a small bonus if they move together for example, Rising Storm 2 does this and it is amazing; hope they will add something like this in a future update!"

If you are looking for a blend between Red Orchestra and Day of Defeat then Day of Infamy is the right game for you. The game provides a great balance between semi-realistic squad combat and fast paced play. As a result every match is exhilarating in it's own way.There is a real sense of role identity in the game. For example, the support class provides cover fire for advancing assault infantry. It is a magnificent thing when everyone works together.Major selling points:- Modern engine and a WW2 game- Legitimate squad tactics required, you will get punished for being a rambo.- Actively developed- Tons of realism units- Small active community'Negatives':The game is in beta and I imagine most issues are going to be worked out on full release.There are some balancing issues but it's hard to balance history. recent changes have fixed a lot of problems.

,Recommended,447820,30435272,Posted: 10 March,all,Khan,"This game was a challenge undertaken by New World Interactive, the developers of Insurgency. The background- this game was originally a mod for Insurgency. The developers decided to not only release what was in that mod as a new game, but decided to DRASTICALLY enhance it.Ironically enough, Day of Infamy has more features than its mother game Insurgency does. This includes an in-depth promotion system that rewards team based actions along with k/d, non-infantry type support like airplanes or artillery, unit abilities, and more.The game itself not only has the original Day of Infamy mod maps, but even more that were designed by the developers and the community.I believe that their regiment skin system is not as great as it could be, however they do not cheat you with them- and they are purely cosmetic items so DoI is kept far far away from ""pay to win"" mechanics.Just as mentioned in the last paragraph, there are no pay to win mechancs whatsoever. What you pay for the first time is what you get. As far as I am aware they have no intentions of releasing PAID DLC, in fact their previous game Insurgency only had FREE DLC and was updated regularly.Furthermore, Day of Infamy has been regularly updated: each time bringing much more content and fixing game performance issues.Conclusion:In these dark days of the gaming industry, it greatly pleases me to see companies like New World Interactive. They do not jump on the DLC bandwagons that many developers have fallen to, and they always deliver exactly what they promise (and even more typically). To be completely honest I would not have bought this game if it was not made by them, in Alpha it was quite horrid. Though I trusted them to fix it, and make it a masterpiece in their collection of releases- they absolutely delivered. Not only would I like to reccommend that you buy this game, but I would like to congratulate you for finding it."

The overall gameplay and the maps echo Day of Defeat the loudest. The actual weapon mechanics are different but more modern. In realism it stands between classic Call of Duty and ARMA. The maps are as big or slightly bigger than class Day of Defeat maps. There are no vehicles.

It needs a lot of polish and doesnt feel as smooth as most WWII type fps games, but it does hold promise.  It makes more of an emphasis on aiming rather than hip shooting.  The aiming is somewhat okay. For some rifles the view is severely hampered when it shouldnt be so limited. The time it take to look through the scope of a rifle when sniping is nice, no quick and fast zoom in and out, it is more akin to realistic time.You often dont get to see who killed you which can be good or bad depending on situation.Overall it is more like what you would experience as far as time goes.  An option to hold your breath and steady your shots would be nice. The recoil on the sniper rifle should be toned down some as it would normally kick back into you not off to the right like it does..I will give the game a positive review here aside. it has good promise ."

I think workshop maps would be good.There are always servers with 32/32 (or a few less) which means you can find an active game easily. There are also official servers which i believe are ones which start with NWI XXXX(Region) with some numerical sequences. A few servers like the 508 and 1st rangers have a killfeed unlike the officials and have more slots which is good, you also tend to have more cooperation through voice and team in custom servers and admins that can stop trolling."

Had no problem installing DOI, and only came across some minor glitches with the Mac version, none of which diminished the enjoyment of the game. At the moment I would rate it about an 8.5/10.Likes.Nice Maps.  The graphics are fine for this kind of game.  Plenty of servers, and so far always found people to play with.  The community has been very supportive, but just remember it is an objective based game, so if you don’t help out capturing objectives it may well be noticed and commented on.Dislikes.For me, going on the offensive was a lot more fun than trying to defend an area.  Attacking just seemed to play a whole lot smoother than holding positions.  By that I mean teams seemed to work much better together when they trying to take out an objective than when they were trying to defend a spot on the map.  This can make it rough when you are on a server, and everyone keeps voting for Entrenchment games.The practice mode is not much use for learning things like the maps, because the bots on your team are usually idiots who spend more time shooting each other than shooting the enemy!

DOD Source just didn't do the original DOD justice. It just wasn't the same. This game gave me the same feeling I would get in a brutal firefight in DOD! I knew right then they were on to something. The Devs are very involved and have done a terrific job of implementing things into the game gradually and seeing things change along the way was very exciting to say the least. The end product to me is superb. I recommend this game to anyone who loves immersive and challenging gameplay. You won't be disappointed. There is a small learning curve, but once you get up to speed it's amazing!"

Also you can't do everything on your own, you have to work together as a team in co-op. Without communication, it's harder to win the game. Instead of running around and killing people, you have to capture or defend your objective to get the team going. Which ever class you choose can determine what your role is in the game, for example, if you have the heavy machine gun class, you have to suppress fire, you can't just run around the map and start shooting people, the officer and radio are two of the most important people in the team and they how to stick together, and the sniper has to give cover for the infantry troops. Without this teamwork, it is hard to capture or defend the objective.Although the graphics are not great and there are still a few bugs, the gameplay is great and the community is friendly. I recommend this game for everyone especially if you love FPS and WW2 games."

,Recommended,447820,30474915,Posted: 12 March,all,Kerfefer,"Day of Infamy is a tactical shooter based on the previous success of Insurgency and the mod created for it, Day of Infamy. As compared with the Day of Infamy mod, the standalone version provides a much more immersive experience with more classes, more weapons, more maps, and a much, much better UI. The combat feels realistic, gritty and very smooth, no arcade style counter strafe headshots with the kar 98 as found with less realistic WW2 shooters. It doesn't feel clunky and grounded like ARMA and does not have the scale of Squad's game modes/maps but this game provides (In my opinion) a much more immersive experience. The battles are fairly small scale but they feel like they take place in a real war. Franchises like battlefield are often accused of ""dumbing down"" the combat and tactical experience in order to cater to a wider audience, this game however does not alter the gameplay at all to make the game more understandable, instead there is a tutorial section in the main menu, which has many very well made videos to help confused players understand the basics, and eventually the complex mechanics and tactics used by more experienced players. As for the gunplay, it is a very good blend of hitscan and recoil, the hitscan does not detract from the overall experience as the maps are too small for bullet drop to have a significant influence and suppression is a great mechanic that makes the player think about what they do and play as if their life depended on it. Recoil is not insane, but it is brutal and hipfire is accurate but has no crosshair, bullets don't always land it the center of the screen. When you shoot, you feel like you are shooting a firearm, shots always feel like they are going where they should, no RNG from what i can tell.This game is hard to describe without going into extreme detail, it's nothing like Day of Defeat and feels much more polished than its predecessor Insurgency. There are many great teamwork mechanics such as the commander class being able to call in artillery and other air to ground ordnance such as smoke barrages and stuka dive bombs, but ONLY if he has a radioman nearby to relay the request to command. This game is definitely not a solo experience, but that does not mean you have to have friend to play it with. Most players are friendly and always interested in working as a team. Features are intuitive and the game is not over-realistic to the point where the game is no longer fun.I'm not quite sure how to end this review as i feel like it was rather abrupt but i'll just say this, Day of Infamy is 100% worth the money."

Here's why this game gets a 10:It's of course really good, but also, it runs very well and has INNOVATIVE FEATURES, without which I cannot give a 10.Graphics: plenty good enough, you aren't getting BF1 level graphics, but OTOH you aren't getting BF1 level of system requirements. You also have gibs flying from explosions, dismemberment, etc.  Vivid and immersive, which is what counts.Sound: simply awesome. So real. Incredible. Takes your immersion to a new level, making the combat that much more visceral.Stability: Game runs very well.  There were some minor bugs upon release, but I can't find any, now that the game has been out a month.Gameplay: As realistic as you are going to get without getting boring (like ArmA), so that is simply perfect.Unique features: Just like in real WW2, there was only local communication.  Only radio-equipped soldiers (a full backpack-sized contraption weighing roughly 35 pounds) could talk remotely.So in DoI, your Voice chat is local, with enemies able to overhear what you say to your teammates if they are close enough.  Unless you are a radio carrier, in which case the other radio carrier can also hear you, which enables some interesting strategic and tactical options.Radios are used by officers, just like in real WW2, and the radioman should stick with his officer, which allows him to call in support under many forms, dependant on which army you are playing as.Overall this is a fantastic WW2 experience.  I cannot recommend this game enough.10 minus zero for anything not awesome = 10/10 final score."

I have discovered that I don't like military sims either, so I need to find a good middle ground between arcade and mil-sim.I think Day of Infamy might be the perfect fit for me.No quickscoping, yet you don't repeatedly get killed before you see anyone.Specific ProsWhile the game is infantry oriented, officers can order bombing runs and supply airdrops, making the game more intense and strategic.Each faction has different divisions and soldier types you can randomly unlock through playing (or microtransactions), which changes the character model of your soldier.

I would compare it to Red Orchestra Osfront 1941-1945, although I haven't played it, they seem to both be going for a realistic WWII experience. Anyways, here are some pros and cons i've found.Pros:-Realistic gameplay (no gamer tags for enemies or allies behind walls, one/two bullet kills, no indicator for kills, and more.)-Lots of different classes, which are all balanced pretty well.-Maps aren't as open as, say, battlefield, but they have branching points and simulate open world pretty well.-Because of the map design, there is room for lots of strategies, and different outcomes on the same map (except one).-Games where one team is winning by a lot can, and usually do, turn around (@Battlefield 1)Neutural:-Hardcore gameplayCons:-Only one bot difficulty, which is pretty easy-The Dog Red map is poorly made, and the defenders win 90% of the time.-Time to respawn gets annoying in some modes, which sometimes makes it a little boring.-Chat is small, and to see what people said earlier you need to open the console.9/10 game overall.

Of course, there are many other weapons that are rarely seen in any games but I'd love to see the italians in this game, with some new maps for each, imagine playing this game in the pacific, with the Japanese against the US, that would be so great.Note: It uses BattleEye anti-cheat which is a crappy program made by a bunch of brainless incompetents, it sucks that the developer of this game had to put that anti-cheat garbage in this game.There are way better anti-cheats around, and anit-cheats that doesn't ♥♥♥♥ up everything, making you wait 5 hours to launch your game just to see that it won't launch because of this crap.I seriously hope that the developer will think about it, to change the anti-cheat program for a better one.I hate cheaters and hackers, but I also hate not being able to play the game because of a crappy program that isn't worth crap, made up by a bunch of incompetents, seriously, just look at their prices, those who made BattleEye are one of the worse ever.Has a few problems but nothing big, such as achievements taking time to count.Has a few glitches but nothing big either, great game overall."

The customization is great, sound is top notch, and the gun-play and their animations are the best available.The one con I will say is that the map design is a little funky. Games like DODs, Ro2, etc; their map design made sense in either a historical or game-play sense. The maps here have odd avenues, strange overlooks, weird nooks and crannies. The kind of map design where you say, ""Who would build city streets and interiors of buildings this way?"" They're just not particularly realistic and don't make you feel ""in the moment"", as it were.

This has some slight changes comparing to Insurgency.You have no body armor, and your regeneration is limited. When your screen is red, means you are really hurt which regeneration only helps a bit. Medic you would need to fully recover.Theres ammo crate and health, which can help you recover and refill.Air support, though you can only use air support if you do the following requirements. Having a officer and a radioman is all you need, which they need to stick together (with the officer calling it).Like Insurgency, it has co op and multiplayer. Not alot of servers comparing to Insurgency though this game is new so its understandable. Still under beta at this moment.This game is more based on Day of Defeat. Just as Insurgency is close to being Counter-Strike. There are map(s?) that are similar to Day of Defeat.Of course, this game has realism.

And there are now flamethrowers!  a note to developers, the range needs to be increased, RO2 has the range to what seems is about right.A couple elements that would make it even better - more destuctive buildings, the ability to climb over objects, counter tops/rubble etc., and to be able to climb through any window that would be realistic to do so.  Other than that, if you liked DOD, you have to get this game, DOI can stand on its own for the improvements and game play, but you will find it to be awesome, new, yet familiar at the same time!Wish list: If there could be a Campaign mode, like RO 2, where each map was a battle in an overall Campaign for a city/strategic terrirtory/objective, with resources and reinforcements added or subtracted depending on battle outcome, that element also ties the maps together, making each map/battle even more important, that would be icing on the cake."

Good luck getting a Radioman since no one cares about teamwork in this game, and the game never forces anyone to pick a class. Most classes have a 2 player limit with one class having 3, but there is one class without ANY limit at all, which makes sure that Radioman will almost never be played since Radioman is inferior to the class without a player limit; atleast on paper. Truthfully, Radioman is ten times better since it enables the Officer to call in helpful support for the team. But that doesn't matter, people are selfish and would rather want a better gun to stay alive six seconds longer rather than help their team advance.There are a couple game modes where a person in your team has to retreat to a position far back in order to allow the dead teammates to respawn. Good luck ever getting anywhere in these gamemodes, half of your team will die 30 seconds after respawning, the other half will refuse to retreat until they're the last man alive, and then they're gonna get shot in the back every time while running in the open expecting not to get shot.This game has an extremely stupid design choice when it comes to VOIP, you can hear both your teammates and your enemies using voicechat, however, that is only if they are very close to you. This is stupid considering that most people using VOIP will be doing it through third-party software which means that whoever wants to actually make some friends in this game will not be able to hear other people most of the game since they have to be practically hugging the person to hear them. What makes this even more ridiculous is that the built-in voicelines have about five times longer hearing range than actual VOIP. So you can give out extremely vague and simplistic commands like ''Move Up'' to your entire team, but if you want to be more specific via VOIP then chances are only one person next to you is gonna hear it.Most of your achievements will break and never progress, some of your achievements will show up as 100% completed yet still locked. This issue would be extremely easy to fix, and the issue has existed for many many months, yet it has not been fixed.The game won't be tracking your XP through matches and thus never leveling you up.You will frequently be artillery bombed through walls and roofs even through three-story buildings.You will be seeing your rifle's scope, magazine, and sling, floating around your pistol.You will get extremely tired of the voice acting; every player of your team seems to have the same voice actor, and voicelines will be spammed frequently. Furthermore, there is no spam filter, someone could be spamming the voices intentionally every second for the entirety of a match.You will get annoyed with the settings menu, which rarely manages to save your settings. Your changes will randomly be reverted back after playing a couple of matches.These are just some of the many issues that plague this game. It is a promising game and it is quite fun for the first ten or so hours, but after that you'll probably regret your purchase when the bugs and issues start to become more obvious, and the fact that the developers keep releasing updates without addressing a single bug.Man, I wish I could leave a positive review. If you take a moment to think about all the issues I wrote above, all of them could be solved with very simple solutions. I guess I'll have to keep hoping.31st of July updateBugfix update was released, patch did not address any issues mentioned above; broken achievements are still an issue, weapon attachments are still bugging out, you can still get mortared through walls and roofs, the list goes on."

It doesn't feel even remotely as polished as Insurgency, even with reused assets. With the news of Sandstorm, suddenly all the bugs this game has (some of which are easy fixes) makes perfect sense. They have given up on this title and dedicated their resources to the next greatest title... to capitalize on the success of the Insurgency series. Getting blown up by air support when hidden in a bunker? No thanks. Getting straffed by an airplane that can shoot through concrete walls? Not worth my time. Getting shot by an enemy when you can only see the slightest sliver of the top of their head? No thank you. Getting blown up by a gernade that is miles away, while your own gernades 'tickle' the enemy? Do the developers even care to patch this game anymore?

Some issues I've had with it:1.  It lacks the ""Create Party"" functionality of Insurgency in the game, which was great.  Now, you're on your own to try to get into games with friends, I guess.2.  There is a button called ""Instant Action"", but what it actually provides is instant spectating.  Unless you're there for the start of the round (about a 50/50 shot a best), you have to sit and watch until someone on the team meets a victory objective to spawn teammates.  Usually this results in ""Instantly spectating an eventual loss without ever playing"".  Just spawn me already, we're playing against the AI, I'm sure they won't mind.3.  The maps get repetitive very quickly, and many assault maps (esp. Sicily) are apparently very difficult, as I've gotten to spectate losses many many times on this map.  If you're going to flame me about being the cause, that would be difficult, because I never got to actually play.4.  There is currently a nasty bug that crashes the game every time you leave a game and try to enter a new one.I will say, the defense style maps can be lots of fun.  They just need to do some work on this game before it will be worth much of my time.  Right now it's hard to play more than a half hour now and again, as it's just very frustrating.Insurgency is obviously the much better game, as things stand right now.  And though I assume this game will get there, it isn't there yet.EDIT:  I have changed my review to positive, as I've found out how to have fun with this.  You need to get some friends, and coordinate which server you join all at the same time (so everyone can actually play without spectating) and make sure it's ""entrenchment"" mode.  Stronghold mode (the attack mode) is still not balanced properly, and there's a whole lot of being killed by artillery and bots who snipe you from across the map.  Or else stand in front of you staring while you beat them with a shovel.  You experience both ends of the spectrum."

No armor nonsense.-Accurate weapon loadouts with limited customization for some weapons-Well-designed maps-Officers have ability to call artillery, but need a soldier with radio which requires teamworkCONS-Tiny selection of maps (so far)-Only 3 factions (US, British and German)-Not enough weapon variety (US lacks shotgun, but British have one.

From airstrikes to outfits, much has changed since this game has started out. It feels as if its a mix between Insurgency, Red Orchestra, and Day of Defeat, and it works well, like, REALLY well.There are 9 classes you can choose from the faction(Commonwealth, US Army, Wehrmacht) you are playing as, each with their own small passive ability.The game also contains a wide variety of weaponry.A major thing that was updated from Insurgency to this, is that the AI is MUCH better, now they will properly take cover, call down airstrikes(if there is a radioman and officer), and they can just generally ♥♥♥♥ your day up if youre not careful, and on top of that you no longer have armor like in Insurgency, so dying is much easier.A small thing that could be viewed as a negative point, is the inclusion of cosmetic microtransactions but at the same time they are incredibly easy to unlock, in two hours of gameplay alone I unlocked three of them and I was just playing PvAI. The cosmetic skins do actually look pretty decent too, from a handful of Canadian Regiments, to both the 12th Frontier Force Sikhs, and the 92nd Buffalo Soldiers.If youre a fan of World War II games, I would defintely say pick this one up.Good devs, good game.P.S. There is a mod for the game called Born to Kill on the workshop as well, its a Vietnam modification for the game much like Day of Infamy was a World War II mod for Insurgency, hell, who knows.. that could maybe even get its own standalone game sometime (Please!)Edit: I just wanted to add that this game has some of the best voice overs I've heard in a WWII game. The Scots, the Australians, and we Canucks sound hilariously authentic.Hilariously because I get a giggle out of everytime I hear the Canadians say Eh, Bud, or Friggin'. Sometimes its all in the same sentence, ex: Friggin' eh, Bud."

I bought a lot of WW2 games after having played the mod for 13 hours. A month later the guys announced the standalone game and I asked my dad for the game as birthday present. He bought it in early access and since then him and I have no regrets. The game has changed a lot since early access but it's enjoyable. The game has a great community with friendly players and  a lot of realism unit such as the ""First Ranger Batallion"". This game is fun even for a half hour before work or school shooting some facists. This game also has workshop support with custom game modes such as: ""Born to kill"" Vietnam mod and ""filthy few competitive mod"". Also the game has alot of sound mods making the game more realistic I love shooting a German that will scream for his momma. I recommend this game to anyone who loves tactical but also quick action.

,Recommended,447820,32025368,Posted: 28 May,all,TheJRCade,"This game is one of the best WWII team based shooters currently on the market with solid gameplay that feels like an upgraded version of Insurgency. The game thrives on you working as a team with your fellow players. In order to succeed, the most crucial part of your team is your officers and radiomen. Snipers help keep the enemy team from advancing quickly and support helps to slow down the enemy front. Other classes clean up the rest. How well these classes are used will determine how successful your team is. That is the fun of it... and also can cause some frustration if your team sucks.Positives:- Fantastic class system. Each role in the game is crucial to have a well functioning team. If any of the roles have an underskilled player in it, your team will feel it.- Gameplay can be both fast and slow depending on the game type.- Heavy emphasis on Teamplay and rewards it. (Especially an officer/radiomen team)- Fantastic Gunplay where each kill feels fulfilling.- Fantastic community that isn't cancerous at the moment and are fun to play with. Due to the small community you will run into the same people regularly.- Exisisting maps are great (But there is arent enough). There are some in the Workshop that players have created that developers really need to incorporate.- Consistantly updated on a regular basis. Team has fixed major bugs and has already added new guns to officers. NWI is constantly listening to the player base.Negatives:- NWI servers seem to be the only stable servers. Player owned servers are fun to play on, but you will experinece frequent crashes of the servers.- Lag spikes are rare, but will occur on certain maps.- Needs more maps.- The officers ability to call in an airstrike is crucial, but I wish you had a circle telling you exactly where it was going to strike. There are times where you point to an area that you wish to bomb and it bombs somewhere else resulting in multiple friendly fires.- For special operations, which is the gametype where you have a smaller team, they need to create smaller maps. Problem that is happening is you are given a small amount of recruitments and put on this large map with little cover. So what is happening is that is that it is easier to quickly dispose of the enemy before even going after an objective making each gametype within special operations a consistant game of team death match.Overall, I highly recommend the game."

But the more rounds I played the more I appreciated this game.  I see a lot of comparisons floating around, calling this a newer version of DoD or Red Orchestra.  Well I have about 300hrs combined between those games, and the gameplay in this isn't either one.  The game engine lends itself to CQB much better than R02, but the lethality is way too high to be a DOD remake.  This feels like a combination of hardcore mode COD2 and Insurgency.  My only complaint is most of the weapon sounds feel ported straight over from Insurgency, they need to add new authentic sounds in the future."

The AI is way better than on Insurgency. Insurgencys insurgents are so idiotic even when they are on hard... while the nazis/allies on Day of Infamy are intelligent and fun to kill.2. When you start cooking people with a flamethrower the screams are harrowing. But on Insurgency, when you throw molotovs and incendaries at the stupid zombie terrorists, they just walk through it with a brief ""Ow"", as if they are stepping on legos.3. Voice acting is very immersive. It's been helping my german as well. I finally know how to say ""grenade out""  and ""open fire"" , which is very helpful when I want my german friends to leave my house.Cons, I guess, they aren't that bad______1.

This game will crash and burn if theres no publicity. 350 players is not acceptable online.Matchmaking right now is not really a likelyhood unless you get lucky and manage to get into a full server. otherwise if your happy like me doing co op then it ain't a problem.

And in a last, feverish, desperate effort, we had secured the objective and stormed the apartments. I had not had time then to think of what I was doing. Of the lives I had stolen from their bodies... or of the lives of my friends that were stolen suddenly and without remorse from theirs, in the whip-like crack of rifle fire.It was only he and I, now. The officer of another squad that had bumbled into us in the middle of the run, confusing our assault. He had no idea of me, and I none of him. We breathed heavily now as if to prove to ourselves that we were alive, that we had made it. Yet we did not look at each other for the sake of those who had not. I tossed my machine-gun to the floor, exhausted. It had no bullets left anyway. And besides, I was sick of this war. I was sick of Hitler, sick of Europe. Sick of hatred and of loss. Too many had fallen, and in stupid and meaningless ways. Such blind chaos darkens the soul.Then, softly at first but grouding louder, a voice. A distant voice.

German shouts ring out in between bursts, muffled as my ears ring.Deep breath. I put a flare cartridge in the M2, finger on the trigger. Captain slaps my shoulder twice, the squads good to go.I swing around the corner and beeline for the stairs, my gait struggling to hold the weight of the fuel tank on my back.

Two steps up and I see grey uniforms. Four or five, can't tell. Doesn't really matter. MG's ring out, hailing on the beach. Gotta get rid of 'em.Rush up the last few steps, ignite the flare cartridge with my left hand on the front trigger. A Small ""fwoosh,"" I see red fire and white smoke.One of the Germans glaces over and spots me. He shouts and struggles to get his rifle at the ready. I open the valve with my right hand.Catch a second of white mist, gasoline fills my nose. The jet of white flies out towards the enemy, obsures my vision. Then I see orange and feel my eyebrows singe from heat. The room is on fire and a ghostly howl emanates from the fire. Black smoke pours out the slit in the bunker, I can feel the air rush from behind to fuel the hellish fire in front.Everything in front of me is aflame. I hold the valve open with an iron grip as more napalm is projected from the nozzle. The flare gives out and I ease off the valve. Suddenly the cool outside air hits my face and I breathe, only to inhale smoke. Instead of silence, the fire's roar gives way to men screaming. Horrifying screams.Five Germans writhe on the floor of the bunker, heaps of black charred flesh, molten cloth and gasoline fire. Gasps for breath haunt my soul to this day, the last cries for mercy of dying men, consumed in fire. A pistol rings out and I duck. Nothing on me stings, my buddies are fine too. One of the Germans took the easy way out. Captain shimmies in front and unloads four rounds into the others. They go limp, flames dancing on their corpses. I smell burnt pork.The guys behind shove me aside and move on ahead. I find myself just... standing there, looking on these poor men. No man should die that way. I come to as Jimmy knocks on my helmet.That was the worst day of my life, and it was far from over.Day of Infamy is one of the best WWII shooters I've played yet. The action is tight, fast paced, intense, and gritty. Every weapon gives the right feel- a bazooka feels like getting punched in the face, a flamethrower gives off the heat, an MG can suppress a whole nation, a bolt action is fast on the draw yet methodical. The AI is hard, unlike Insurgency, which keeps the challenge high and the action constant. If it's quiet, something is not right and you should watch yourself.While this game is small in scale, it doesn't fail to give the experience of a grunt in the thick of it."

You can smell the cordite coming from your monitor in the bombed out city.Biggest pokes at the devs are the following:1) The AI aim is wayyyy too good as of 7/30/16.  They are headshotting moving targets from range and close in with way too high a percentage.  You would expect a spray of bullets to take you out.  Not one single bullet.  At least have a clue you are being shot at like in Insurgecy.   The difficulty is jacked up about twice what you get on the Sernix (sp?) server in Insurgency.   Those are some of the most brutal servers.  They are a joke compared to the AI difficulty in Day of Infamy.  Just lower their accuracy a little.  Don't make it a cake walk, but aimbots are ragequit worthy.2) Spawnrate needs adjusted.  We took the bunker on the Scicily map, had the cap bar full with 3 guys inside and 3 outside, and the AI kept spawning on the roof of the bunker.   We never could get it to turn to ours.

76561197962141422,Recommended,447820,33259118,Posted: 4 July,all,Ironblood,"This game is as close to a faithful sequel to Day of Defeat as you're going to get, as well as Insurgency. Both titles are extremely entertaining in their own regard, and the depth of this game along with the visible effort of creating a unique interface makes this title stand on its own. Once you play a title like this, you can't really enjoy something like Counter Strike as much, so if you've spent a ton of money on skins, you probably shouldn't play this game. This game is not about memorizing spray patterns, most guns are bolt action - kills do not feel cheap in this game. This game is about staying alert and working as a team. There are more than 2 chokepoints, more than 2 corners to watch, and you are almost never in a totally secure position. You're probably going to die many times, even more than Insurgency since there are barely any aiming attachments. Most of the maps are extremely large, and quite detailed with many rooms for engagement. The class system is slightly closer to Team Fortress than it is to classic Insurgency, with each slot having an identity and playstyle rather than Insurgency's Sniper and Sniper-Lite. Not to mention commanders & radios, a rewarding (or frustrating) change of pace. There's a small bit of customization with different unlockable divisions - none of which require a microtransaction and do not effect gameplay. All around well-executed and this is probably the last great shooter we will get out of the source engine."

The very hardcore gameplay that rewards you for thinking about your moves and punishes you for playing as if it was COD. Lots of close calls with sighs of relief, and plenty of yelling when you die. This game is extremely fun and enjoyable."

As a noob with my MG42 i was only getting about 2-4 frags. After i observed the good players for a few hours and knew the key positions i was at about 23 frags in two rounds, but only if my team was helping me a little out e.g. knowing how the different roles are working. For example blocking side entrances, scouting. Sadly there will always be some bad players, like running into my stream of MG42 bullets wich could easily beeing avoided because you can hear this monster pretty good... and if your comrade drops down in the door way in front of you, you dont follow him blindlessly...Day of Infamy as well as Insurgency are not only very fast paced but also very tactical."

The vibe is a perfect blend of Day of Defeat, medal of honor with a dash of the original red orchestra yet it feels fresh and innovative like its predecessor. And as in Insurgency it is easy to die and it takes teamwork and some skill, tactical and gun-wise, to succeed. This makes for a rich and rewarding gameplay experience. Clever implementation of officer and radioman and artillery dynamics adds depth and breadth to the gameplay experience that has plenty of dramatic tension and cinematic flare.The graphics are dated but look good and the  lighting and art style, sound design and solid gameplay, cool physics and effects more than make up for any lacking in this departmentIn short, it's a fresh and fun experience with just the right amount of nostalgia for us gamers from the ww2 pc era and lots to offer newcomers who have yet to enjoy the this setting and brand of hardcore fps mayhem. Like a lot of good art it feels like an ode to the classics but expands on/rifs off of them intelligently and innovates in all the right areas.

Changing one graphical setting causes the whole game to freeze and the audio to loop. I have to force quit via task manager every time.

My CPU is crap as it's an AMD but it's still an 8350 and I have a slight OC on it at 4.4 so I shouldn't be struggling to get over 45fps.The issue is likely on my end since none of the reviews I see mention performance issues or instablity.

The only thing I don't like, and this isn't really the game's fault, is a good portion of the community, from my experience. This applies to a lot of other multiplayer semi-realistic games, but I notice a lot of those late 30's army wannabe rejects (who cant join the army irl and gotta take the game too seriously and have things their own way to meet the army experience they cant get) getting mad at the simple stuff. Shooting at an enemy and they walk around the corner at the wrong time in front of your gun and you hit them? ""I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥friendly, jackazz! Watch where you're shooting!"". Try to explain it to them that they walked out in front of you at the wrong time? Get TK'd instantly. Wise guy loser teens with attitudes and sad lives also be plaguing, mostly in co-op from my experience. (Yes. They find ways to be salty in CO-OP). Did you spawn right before an objective was captured as a radioman, and have to run a long way to get to the SL at the new objective and they die? Somehow you were just ""sitting in spawn, sniffing your own♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Try to explain it to them? You're apparently salty. But if you can deal with them, yeah it's a pretty good game."

A great deal of content is also available considering it's not a triple A title and currently (22/04/2017) the unlock system seems to be purely cosmetic too, which is not common in newer games, this means you can actually play the entire game right from the start.The only issue is optimisation I have encountered so far, but it seems to slightly improve with newer patches, but there could be problems on lower end systems, my game however runs at an ok framerate with most at max except for scope quality (medium) and 2x msaa instead of 8x."

It runs smoothly and the community is nice.The only issue i really see is the bolt action rifles. Being a rifleman in this game is currently not worth it, at all!! Reload speed is huge, the iron sights are quite ""meh"" in my opinion and the smgs have everything packed to the point that a rifleman is pretty much a deadweight on any team.I understand that DoI is not supposed to be a copy of DoD with better graphics, but the balance of bolt action rifles and the rest of the classes was perfect, and so why not bring it to this game aswell."

,Recommended,447820,31408722,Posted: 27 April,all,The Real Mr.Blue,"Do you like seeing your friends and brothers in arms turned into lifeless pulps of meat? Do you like the constant sound of gunfire as you charge through a storm of bullet coming from a bunker on D-Day? Do you enjoy turning whole groups of British soldiers into barbeque using a flame thrower? If so, this game is for you.I love this game, I've loved it ever since I downloaded the Insurgency mod on which this game was based. Each match is its own symphony, the beautiful crescendo of gunfire as the battle erupts. The thunder of artillery striking the battlefield like accents on a piece of music shocking you to the bone. The screams of soldiers, both friend and foe, as you bolt through the battlefield fill your ears.Now to the actual review, if you like Insurgency and WW2, buy this game. If you just like Insurgency but aren't fond of the WW2 theater I'd still consider this game a must have, the combat, like Insurgency's, is superb. I know this review was kinda crap but seriously. BUY. THIS. GAME. The devs are great, updates are constant and common (about once a month), the gameplay is superb (over 50 hours on a game with no singleplayer shows something about this games ability to hold interest, especially when the person has over 250 games) and it's generally just a blast. That's all I have to write about this game but I hope it helped in your decision somehow, also, If you do decide to purchase this glorious game, my opinion is that the support class is the best, most support guns (The BAR,FG42, and Bren) are all one shot kills. So yeah, I hope I helped in your decision somehow but honestly if you're even just slightly considering purchasing this game, do it, for $20 how much can you regret?"

The gameplay is pretty much Insurgency in WW2, which should be no surprise since it was a mod for Insurgency. However, there are some balance improvements that make it a more enjoyable experience. First, the maps are larger so ranged combat with machine guns and bolt action rifles is more viable.  SMGs are also no longer the powerhouse that they were in Insurgency. Maps are also more open while also having more cover and concealment, allowing for more opportunities to flank or close with your enemy.However, the map design also suffers from a maze-like structure that can make it confusing to navigate. For example, a map like Saint-Lo has many strange dead-ends that can slow you down from getting to the action.They also added an officer class that can call artillery. This allows you to break up defenses and can lead to some high-intensity matches, but also is highly imbalanced. Bombing runs on spawns are very common and can lead to a back-to-back team wipe. Obviously these are very frustrating. It also leads to a lot of random deaths, which can be seen as a pro if you want to feel like a helpless infantryman, but it also gets irritating after you get randomly blown up for the 100th time."

While not perfect it already does so much better than other FPS titles. The gripping realism of the damage model makes the game incredibly difficult but fun. Most weapons in the game are very lethal and you’ll be dead on the floor before you even realize what happened. Every single bullet could put you in your grave, you’ll have to use cover and play smart while talking with your team. There are no kill-cams or kill-feeds on screen so you’ll have to visually confirm each kill to be sure. You’ll have to manage your ammunition because you only know how many magazines that you possess, not the amount of rounds in each one so be careful and think twice if you should reload. In order to survive, you’ll have to play strategically and play the objective either directly or indirectly by performing your classes duties to better serve your team.There is one thing that irritates me to no end. The loading time between games when the server changes the map, this process can usually take a few minutes. What specifically irritates me is that some people load in before me and the game begins without me."

The game's main focus is on teamplay; no one works alone. The teams are made up of a number of players who each choose a role based on the team's needs and their personal playstyle, ranging from Officers to Snipers and even Flamethrowers.Pros:- Very realistic gameplay, no crosshairs, no bullet counters etc.- Heavy focus on team-based gameplay, each class relies on another to work properly- Localised voice chat, meaning only people nearby will hear you speak: realism at it's best- Unique loadout system, where points for purchasing equipment for your outfit (class) is earned by good performance- Decent graphics (this game is still a WIP)- Voiceover is limited (you WILL hear the same sentences several times), but good qualityCons:- Due to Early Access, this game still has some minor and major bugs that can affect gameplay experience- All the popular servers (from personal experience) are in the US (west coast I think), so if you don't live near there you may not get a good opportunity to experience the multiplayer (like me, I live in Australia)-  There's this one bug in particular where after leaving a match, and trying to join another, the game will crash sometimes.Final Rating: 8/10"

76561197986181055,Recommended,447820,33199688,Posted: 3 July,all,MrDirectX,"Firstly let me start by saying I have been playing various first person shooters for well over two decades, and have experienced the ""golden age"" of FPS releases during the late 90's early 2000's.  Let's start with the positive as these reason's are the selling point for purchasing this game.Weapon mechanics, and realism, these two factors alone are the icing on the cake for this game, as even titles like Battlefield, Call of Duty, Titan Fall, etc fail to live up to these expectations without turning into simulators like Arma, America's Army, or Squad.  Day of Infamy does not attempt to be a simulator, but nonetheless offers the best of both worlds in some regard with very respectable realism (recoil, suppression, and weapon mechanic's) while offering very fun gameplay.  Another positive is the reliance on teamwork (depending on the game type) required in order to accomplish the games objectives, meaning no one man can effectively win the game (except for the very rare cheater).Now for the bad (yes this game has some very nasty elements as well), yes no game is perfect and one shouldn't expect this from any title.  However there is several issue plaguing this particular title performance, optimization, and an aging graphics engine represent major items for consideration.  Disclosure:  I have been testing the game on various Operating Systems (Ubuntu/Linux Mint, and Windows) with very high end system specifications (Core i7 6800k @4.1 GHZ, GTX 1080 ti @2100 MHZ GPU Clock, 64 GB DDR4 @32000MHZ, and all apps/games are installed on SSD storage 6x Samsung 850's in a RAID 0 configuration).  Given the afformentioned system, the biggest drawback has to be the performance of this game despite the engine targeting this game being so dated.While I always achieve a locked 60 FPS using an unlocked frame rate seems to reflect various annoying FPS spikes on a variety of maps (my system's display is 1440p @140HZ ) regardless of the graphics settings.  This issue appears agnostic to the OS/drivers, and persists on both platforms (Linux/Windows), even on different hardware as well.  Given similar games such as Insurgency, and Counter Strike: Source do not experience this problem, I suspect the problem is with DOI.Finally, this game is a gem despite the performance optimization issues and I highly recommend anyone looking for an actual challenge in the FPS realm purchase DOI."

,Recommended,447820,25876878,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,CWürth,"Day of Infamy is a World War 2 FPS that focuses primarily on multiplayer squad based combat.  It is being developed by the same team that works on Insurgency, so if you are a fan of the latter you'll probably feel comfortable with this title.The game itself puts the German Wehrmacht against US and British Commonwealth troops in various locales such as Italy, Germany, France, and other similar western front areas of operation.  The gameplay feels very similar to Insurgency, with tight gun play and frantic close to mid-quarters combat.Weapons:The weapons are very well-presented and represent with a fair degree of accuracy as to what was available at the time, with varying strengths and weaknesses that go along with it.  What is available to you depends on the class & nation you align with.  At the time of writing, these classes & nations are fairly balanced, with only a few minor peeves that will be discussed below.Rifles:Germany, the US, and the Commonwealth both have standard bolt-action rifles for the rifleman class, while the standard US GI & German infantryman can opt to carry semi-automatic rifles at the cost of resupply points/weight.  The bolt-action rifles are ridiculously accurate and powerful, however they are fairly useless in close-quarters combat, requiring strategy and smart placement decisions.Automatics:Each nation also has a variety of automatic sub-machine guns/assault rifles that can be used in the Assault class.  While these do not allow you to ""focus"" closer than rifles, their close-quarters use is essential on many of the current maps.  Currently the most powerful/accurate of these is the German STG44, however the sheer rate of fire of the US Thompson puts it close behind.  The British Sten has a lower rate of fire, but less recoil.Explosives/Grenades:The US has the Bazooka, Germany the Panzerfaust, and the British the PIAT.  I never really cared for the RPGS & such in Insurgency, and they feel pretty much the same in Day of Infamy.  Sometimes they can come in handy, but I have not yet experienced a need for them.  The Commonwealth & US both have fragmentation grenades that seem to travel much further than the German stick grenade, though all three nations seem to be as effective in explosive proximity.Officers:Where Day of Infamy really shows itself apart from Insurgency is the effective use of Officers on the field.  The officer can call in artillery & smoke when in proximity to any soldier carrying a radio (which almost all classes can currently carry, though they are ""expensive"" in the weight/resupply).  An effect leader/officer in this game can really turn the tide or make it difficult to for the enemy to advance.  Storming positions that are being pounded by artillery feels intense!Graphics/Performance:Though it is still running and a very dated engine, upgrades have really helped keeping this game look very polished & running efficiently - with all options maxed out, even a moderate graphics card will rarely ever dip below 60FPS.  SLI/Crossfire users beware: there are bugs when using these options such as low fps until changing a graphics setting in each new map, and warped textures.  Turning this game to borderless easily fixes the issue, however you will not get the benefit of two cards in the mode.Peeves:There is very little to be unhappy about in Day of Infamy, though there are some issues that will hopefully be ironed out in time.  One of these is the Commonwealth Ithaca shotgun - you can be sure that if you are ever on a map against the Commonwealth, you will be killed by this.  The gun in it's current state is too powerful and reloads at a unrealistically fast rate; one shot and you are dead seemingly from any mid range.  Another issue is the use of machine guns: these guns take a little too long to deploy, and currently there are not many good positions to set up on the current rotation of maps.  If you are laying down suppressive fire, you will quickly be shot down as your tracers make you a huge target.""Teamwork""The game itself does not really reward team playing, and many matches easily turn into a free-for-all with no one taking over the Officer class or using it responsibly.  However, when you are on a good team with good officers - this game is absolutely satisfying.  It is good to see that classes are limited - you cannot have a team consisting of nothing but assault or sniper classes.  I believe that the developers are currently tweaking this, as updates over a short time have changed the quantity of each class allowed.Sound:As with Insurgency, the sound effects in this game are amazing.  There will be times on headphones that you will find yourself ducking as bullets wiz overhead or begin striking the cover around you.  The gun effects and explosions are particularly nice!Maps:The maps are really well designed with lots of options that will require teamwork to effectively take or defend positions.  I do hope that more maps will enter the rotation as time goes by.Gamemodes:There are currently a few different game modes, though most of them feel the same.  Go to point and attack or defend.  Take next point.  Fall back.  Etc.  The action never stops, however.Overall, this game is a blast to play when you are playing with good officers.  If you like frantic grit of Insurgency but want to step back into WW2, this game is an absolute must!9/10 in current state!"

The interface is clear, and the sights and sounds, along with the lethality of the weapons, make it an engrossing and tense experience.  When a group functions as a team and takes those cap zones it's satisfying thing to be a part of.  When an individual player stumbles into the rather steep learning curve of one shot kills it can be intimidating.  Going Rambo can work against the bots, sometimes, but mostly it gets you a seat as an observer until some kind soul who values cap zones more than kill counts springs you from Rambo/New Guy timeout.The maps in early access version are well done, but there's not an abundance of them, something that the Workshop or NWI will surely remedy.  Lots of game modes to try, with various ways to earn victory.There's a lot of historical detail. The weapons, effects, sounds and characters all combine for an authentic feel.  There's plenty of grognard nits to pick, including the abundance of some fairly rare weapons. Those who know that the M1 carbine didn't mount a bayonet during the period the game covers will find fault, and there are a few other quibbles, but hey, there was a Magic Marker in Saving Private Ryan and the general public didn't care then, either.In fact, this game is a lot like Saving Private Ryan:  It covers old ground, but does it in a way that makes it hard to ignore, because it's got an intensity that carries the day over any errors in detail and the familiar setting.Big thumbs up here."

Around 1k+ are playing the game and VOIP is used very oftern. If YOU use it then others will also take use of it. The first day aka release day the amount of new players was hight, expected and they didnt know what to do but it was not so bad.The 3rd day, one game was on Ortona (hope the spelling is right). I played as Wehrmacht and was on the last objective to capture before the radio.... I camped with an other player and we held out around 5+ min. Nobody could come downstairs and  the door was blocked by me with Karabiner 98kurz. He aimed to the stairs with his Fallschirmgewehr 42. The game was epic. Zero respawns left and no way to get to the radio. We killed more than 30 brits. Just epic and the server was populated not only by eastern europeans or americans. Finally a gaming experience where the ping of the other players were at a max of 150ms.If YOU want the best experience go to the community servers like the ""1st Ranger Btn 1#"" or the second server in EU because the mods take care of the teamplay and kick trolling players. Since the launch the other servers are equally teamplay-friendly.All in all DOI is like a mixture of Medal of Honor Allied Assault, Day of Defeat + Source, Call of Duty 1 + United Offensive and a less agrovating way of Red Orchestra 2 more like the first game, because the server population of the second game is just bad imo. The 3 or more servers I have played only had the same map over and over again and there was no way to push in contrast to DOF where the maps are so polished so that theres always a way to get at least a frontline war -> to play with 0 respawns.March 2017The servers are getting fuller and there are not only Americans and eastern europeans playing.Playing the game is great again and the gamemodes are better, much better than before.Now theres a chance to play a gamemode where the objectives are clear but you do not know where they are.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------January 2017Mainly played by Americans = no players in eu - and no teamwork like always which is also in other games---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Doesn't crash anymore but on the newest map the fps is dropping to often.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After December Update (Alpha to Beta phase)This game crashes now every 2nd game.Original ReviewDay of Infamy is a mixture of Day of Defeat, Medal of Honor Allied Assault and Return to Castle Wolfenstein Enemy Territory (and Insurgency + Red Orchestra).

I played the EA in early September of 2016 and the game has killed itself. I loved to play as the German's but now all i can do is rage because:-MP40 has no range and does little damage at that range (The MP40 in Insurgency does more damage and has more range...)-Two of their weapons are limited to the map (MG42 and StG44)-MG class no longer has an option of choosing the MG34 or MG42-Only 1 person (only a couple of maps let you have two) can have the StG44 or FG42The reason the StG44 got nerfed to only 1 is because it was ""too good"" which I will say that it was, but the Shotgun for the British was also ""too good."" What they did for the shotgun was:-Does less damage now-Less range-Still can be equiped by the same amout of people-Still quite goodWhat they did for the StG44 was:-Less damage-More recoil-Less range-only one person can have it (either the StG44 or the FG42, both the best guns the German's have)-Made the supply points needed to have it really highTL:DR: Germans got nerfed so hard since EA, Game is worse then Insurgency, Everyone that I know who has played the EA says this game is worse now, but everyone who didn't play the EA says this game is good."

,Recommended,447820,32098867,Posted: 31 May,all,Salt,"Why this game is the ♥♥♥♥ing best.In my opinion, this game is my favorite WWII, and my only favorite because of these reasons during my Alpha, Beta, and release gameplay.First reason, is because of the freaking air support, you can command an officer of a division within a certain military (Commonwealth, Wehrmacht, United States) and call in air support (there are many different types of air support, strafing, bombardment, air strikes, EVEN AIR DROPS!).YOU CAN FREAKING KILL PEOPLE WITH AIR DROPS BY THE WAY! Calling in air support for your team is very fun, you can see your opposing team just start running over to shelter as bombs start dropping above them, screaming for help, body parts everywhere.. Just... AMAZING.Anddd thenn the second reasons, I really like how the game is running on Source Engine, it's pretty great how it was a mod at first for another game NWI owns (Insurgency) but they advanced it further into an actual game, that's pretty freaking cool if you ask me Kamerade, oh sh*t, excuse me my german blood kicked in (I'm not actually German lol). The game has realistic damage compared to real life, just imagine getting multiple bullets everywhere on your body with an MP40 or MG42, the knees, arms, torso, then the head, and you're out. Also, one single shot in the a** cheeks with a rifle and you're out by the way, they even have historical units that *probably* exists still in the present! I also really like the recoil with the guns, it's very realistic, also when someone throws a grenade at you, YOU CAN THROW THEM BACK. I like doing this to fu*k with them, haha!Third reason, remember when I said the game is on Source Engine? Well, you can run the game like a gameboy, basically, what I'm saying is that you can play in low settings without no problem at all! Just lower your resolution, graphics, and you're set! Also, if you have no internet for some reason and some how downloaded the game, there is an offline mode to play against Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots, ;)!But..I don't think this game is done yet, there are small amounts of glitches, not that much though. Anyways, overall, it's fu**ing amazing!okay now im tired of typing in grammar in this review which *may*  have been edited or revised, i also had stuff in my mind that i was really excited to put but ended up forgetting, meh, whocares.bye now have fun cooking people alive with flamethrowers,shooting people in the azz cheeks and screaming in your mics"

They have different game modes from attack and defend to one where you fight over control points, pushing the other team (or getting pushed) further to your spawn. 8/10 in it's current state.

Anyways, if you experience the same I experienced written down there, then try verifying your cache before giving this game a bad review.""I have to try to connect to the same server 3 times, every time I start up the game, in order to play one match... Sorry, but no. This makes it unplayable for me and overally unejoyable.""Just verify your cache. And if that's not enough then verify your cache and launch the game. press alt+ctrl+delete and run task manager. Go to the details tab and put DoI's priority to high.Do that everytime you play it. It works for me.Hope it helps.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now onto the actual review:Day of Infamy is a standalone game of the famous(?) DoI mod from Insurgency, except with better visuals, improved graphics/guns and some features that weren't present in Insurgency or the DoI mod, such as more complex objectives and the ability to call in an airstrike. Not to mention that both sides can call in an airstrike, and yes, even bots in co-op can call in airstrikes.Not to mention that when the game leaves beta, players will be able to unlock other divisons, such as paratroopers. Definitely an improvement from Insurgency and it's DoI mod. It's a fun game to play and if you're into realistic games, give it a try.Pros:- Lots of improvements.- Better weapons and visuals compared to the DoI mod from Insurgency- Additional features.- In the near future there will be more divisions, allowing for a more versatile gameplay experience- More objectivesCons:- It needs some optimization.I give it a 8/10. It's a good game."

I got it during the summer sale, and let me tell you that the purchase was well worth it.Free updates, no micro-transactions, you need to rank up in order to get things in this game. Although you can still get stuff via the community market for Day of Infamy.The gameplay is just like Insurgency, but you have army units which can personalize your character, and the weaponry attachments are the same just like Insurgency as well. The guns feel realistic and the reload animations are amazingly animated in my opinion.One new thing in DOI unlike Insurgency is that the radioman and officer can call in support, which can include artillery, gun fire from airplanes, smoke, or ammunition drops. The planes can be seen from above which look awesome.You can play as the Commonwealth, Wermarcht, or the U.S. Army. There are many maps to play on and many objectives. You can play cooperatively or play in multiplayer with other people or bots. As I mentioned before, there is a ranking system unlike Insurgency, and it feels great ranking up and gaining new army units too.My system is getting a little old, but I can run this smoothly at 60 FPS without much frame drops, it's been built on the Source engine and I really like it. There are cool things like body gibs that tear apart from you when you explode, bloom, motion blur, realistic scopes, and grass physics that don't slow down my system at all.The only thing I dislike about the game is that the characters don't have facial animations when speaking. When you're spectating someone in third person, it looks funny when they use a voice line and there's no facial animations. But that won't affect the game in any way other than making it look funny sometimes.This game is good for a WWII FPS, feels like Insurgency, but just improved a bit. If you love WWII or Insurgency, you could give this a go."

76561198114130931,Recommended,447820,31916032,Posted: 23 May,all,My Sack Itches,"I figured I'd write a positive review for once.This game is well worth the twenty dollars. Combat is intense, and it has the feeling of pitched battles despite the 32 player count limit. Weapon variety is good and it does so without completely breaking historical accuracy (though FG42 on Crete bothers the hell out of me). It isn't Heroes and Generals where the starting German weapon is a ♥♥♥♥ing G43. Yeah if only they had enough of those to arm everyone in the Wehrmacht.The maps are well designed for the most part and suit gameplay well (Bastogne needs rebalancing. It is rare for the Germans to take the first objective). This is a game that does a lot with so little. It runs on source, an engine that is holding the game back I feel. Source does not support ballistics, bullet velocity, etc. Therefore, the shooting mechanics are hitscan. Normally this is a non issue. Engagement distance is pretty close most of the time, so bullet travel isn't a concern. Still, I beleive this game would benefit greatly from an added ballistics system. Again, this isn't the game's fault.On the topic of source engine, one would expect the game to look hideous because of the source engine, but thankfully it doesn't. Of course, it doesnt look like Battlefield or other AAA games but it doesn't look too shabby. Lighting is well done and weapon and character models look presentable.The major issue with this game is performance and stability. Make sure you have a good ♥♥♥♥ing processor or this game will♥♥♥♥♥♥itself every now and again. (Nothing less than quad core. Currently have i3 6100. Regretting everything about it). Of course, source games are CPU intensive so if you're playing a bunch of source games you should have a good processor. Still though, part of me feels this game could be better optimized.This game can also be crash happy at times. My crashes are infrequent but I get at least one every time a I play for extended periods. Others complain about it crashing on startup, crashing every few minutes..etc. So before you buy, be aware of this issue.All in all this is a great game that provides an authentic WW2 expereince (though not quite like Red Orchestra 2). Player base is small but dedicated. Finding servers has been no problem for me.One last thing. New World Interactive thinks putting ""nwi"" on the KAR98k receiver is cute. It isn't. Please put historically accurate production codes and dates on the receivers.7/10. Performance issues need to be addressed."

There's already decent map diversity, a solid and dedicated player base, and the game actually runs pretty smoothly.  New World isn't trying to pull a quick one on you- based on where the game is at already it seems like they genuinely intend on finishing it.TBH I've been trying to figure out all day exactly why the game is so enjoyable (purchased last night).

This has many cool realistic features that makes you feel like your in WW2. It also has fair and great map design to keep both team balance on either who wins or losses. Even the AI's in the COOP mode are challenging to fight as they act really smart when encountering plays, it feels like your actaully fighting a skillful player to be honest.On the bad side however, there isn't that many maps to play and it still feels like Insurgency for those who have played it or seen the gameplay of it. But this still gives you plenty of great game modes to choose and play from plus it's great new experience for those who haven't played Insurgency or wants to get the WW2 realistic feeling to it.So yes, I'm recommended for people to play this as these Devs are working their very best and hard work to listen what the people need and for everyone to support this game."

Best way to put it is simply that this is by far the best shooter I have ever played, best game I have ever played. I have never had such an enjoyable experience on a video game in my entire life. I was kind of in a slump with gaming, and was out of games until summer of 2016 came and this beauty came along. I can remember playing this as just an Insurgency mod and was very excited to hear that it was going to become its own game, and rightfully so. Best things about this game are the gameplay, audio, visuals, cinematic feel, music, and also the community for sure. New World Interactive has done a phenomenal job to utilize the Source engine in a way that has never been done. This isn't just some ""walk around and shoot"" game. The gameplay is like no other game out there, it's an intense, strategic, methodical style of playing that goes into this, and it is a sublime experience.In my honest opinion, I see no inherent flaws with the game, it is just perfect. A perfect game hidden in a schlockfest of shooters."

More content will be added as this is a early access game. The player base has risen and more stuff is added every update. So far I definitely recommend this game.Gameplay: The gameplay is very similar to the mod's but the introduction of new weapons like the flamethrower and the introduction of artillery, which will receive a point of it's own, makes it a little more intense and spices it up a little. Also there are a lot more weapons and a lot more attachments for them. 9/10Artillery: What I think is a major aspect of the gameplay is the new artillery feature which can only be ordered by a officer who needs to be next to a radio man. Most classes can be radio men however this takes up your backpack slot and 3 loadout points, so many people don't select the radio kit. Also some people can't grasp the fact you have to point your mouse at the point you want to fire it upon. There are strafing runs and carpet bombings too which makes the game even more intense.  9.5/10Graphics: It seems everyone talks about graphics these days, including myself, so the graphics are very good for source, the player models are similar to that of the mod's but with better eyes, and the weapon models are amazing so the graphics are pretty good for source. They seem to have improved since I started this review too. 8/10Atmosphere: This game has two atmospheres depending on the server you join,  either jokey or intense, which both are good as jokey breaks up the intensity of the gameplay up and intense makes it feel like your there. The communtity did drop off but is back with the new updates. 8.5/10Conclusion: This game is very good with its intense gameplay, fun community and general grittiness so I can't wait to see it out of early access, overall I would rate this 8.5/10."

If you have played the Mod before than this game will feel familiar to you as the core machanics of the game {the realism, controls, ect} have not changed. The guns are still very realistic and the damage model is still punishing {you dont walk off getting hit by a bullet to the head.} However this is NOT a re-skin of the Mod, in the sence that the Developers just took the mod and copy and pasted it into the game.Pros:The sound in this game is AMAZING and much better than in the mod, everything sounds great and realy makes you feel like your in battle.The graphics are much better. While the original mod was much darker and the models a little bland. The developers made the maps and models look much better, lighting is also improved and can really help show off this game.The maps are varried, some are very large and open while some are mostly close quarters house to house fighting.The develpoers added more weapons to the game than the original mod {including a whole new group to play as, the British.} Some new toys are the MG-34, Flamethrower, Rifle Grenade, and melee weapons.Cons:This game is still in Alpha so remeamber that there will be some bugs. However I expericned nothing that was game breaking.I have noticed that the kill counter doesnt allways record your kills {minor problem.}Conclusion:I cant even remeamber anything else, nothing was super buggy or game breaking. This game can use a touch up here and there but as far as games in Alpha go this is a amazing game and deffinetly worth every penny. 10/10"

However my largest concern at this stage is that, as it is currently, it is so unbalanced that it's nearly unplayable. The AI can 1 shot kill you (vs your 3 or more shots to kill them) is bad enough but that they are able to do it around corners and through hard cover takes the joy out of exploring the mod and experiencing it's current potential. After many years of the same old mechanics, cycling through the weapons needs to be updated as do reload times... It's a difficult descion to keep it or wait for it to become more developed but based on my experience with Insurgency I've decided to keep it and hope for the best.."

This is a must-buy for WW2 fans.Playing as an officer? you need a radioaman.. you cant call airstrikes without a radio! (unlike other famous games) I really like this feature in this game because its the only one that has it.Realistic & HardcoreThere is no armor, every shot hurts bad, one shot one kill just like in real life. Hardcore game, (you die alot xD) if you're new to fps shooters, try another game such as: cs:go, cod series, etc...You can play in 3 factions: Wehrmach, Commonwealth and the U.S ArmyUnits system! you can unlock different units for each faction with other faces/camofluages/voices which makes soldiers look unsimilar to each other, so you dont have a clone army. (unlike other games.. AGAIN)Historically Accurate!Some units and weapons cant be accessed in certain maps, for example: Crete 1941, in this map you cant get the STG44 (MP44) because it was made in 1943, same thing for units.Co-op ModeOther than multiplayer, you can play coop mode against AI, If you want an extreme challenge select COMMANDO difficulty and it will be harder than multiplayer.Weapons & MapsIt has alot of weapons and 11 maps, more are coming soon!You can apply attachments (Scope, extended mag, etc...)GraphicsGood but not amazing, dont forget that this game is on source engine, old engine.Great game with a good price (20$), never miss this game on a sale!"

It's much more fun that DoD Source and feels even better than Insurgency. The weapons all feel very accurate and true to the real life counterparts, especially the German MG42.Only problems so far is some performance chokes, particularly with lots of smoke around and explosions going off. For an early access title though I'm really excited to see how this will develop. It's most likely going to be mainly a multiplayer based game, but if you own Insurgency you get 15% off so I think it's easily worth that. Also it's worth noting that the AI definitely will need some work, it's acceptable but far from the Insurgency AI.Compared to Red Orchestra 2, it's much more fast paced and not nearly as much camping. If you like Insurgency but want an even more authentic feeling game, I would definitely recommend this."

The Coop and MP options are fun and daunting, although the map rotations and preferences get stale. The lack of a true campaign style SP hurt the game, but being a DoD copy, you can understand that. Also missing are Eastern Europe and Asia theatres. I of course would assume these can be wrapped up in an xpac DLC.I enjoy coop play mainly, the map types offered are Stronghold, Entrenchment and Raid. SH being a capture the points progression. Each capture will respawn those who died, so mobility and aggression win. With Entrench, its defend those capture points from waves of bots. Losing a point pushes the defenders back. Respawning is based off the player count left alive. Once enough people have died you can run back to ""resupply"". Raid is just 3 random objectives on any given map, they switch each round, and you must roam the maps to ""discover"" them. Not a fan of raid, since people get split up and picked apart most times, also not a fan of entrench. Mainly your game ends up waiting 5 min for people to die while you sit there bored. SH has the same thing, where the team is down to one man, who hides in a corner for 5 minutes because he is scared. Thankfully we have numerous vote options to take care of people or situations like that.The bots, these are a hit and miss. In one aspect, they camp wonderfully and are amazing at moving into areas and sweeping out people, they only take a second to lock onto you, and also react amazingly to sound. They arent smart, running into artillery strikes and piling over 20 dead comrades in a door because of a well placed MG. Its still better than most games. The creators tout a ""morale"" system. Bots would react to lost limbs, burnt corpses and other triggers that would cause them to flee or panic, If this exists i havent seen it. They will charge over burning and dead bodies with no issues, although the supression system does work in them. Supressed is a neat idea, having allies die nearby you, next to you, or just getting pinned down by enemy fire will cause a debuff of sorts, lowering your vision and hearing, as well as making gun waver more pronounced. It works well, but can be manipulated.In general this is a great game if what you want is a ww2 casual game. Nothing too elaborate or hard to figure out. Great mod support from the devs as well as interesting maps and guns, sounds could use a little work, but workshop takes care of that. Once you get the hang of the resupply and classes, and working in a team instead of Rambo you will find the game worth the money."

The team working is absolutely essential to win the round. The officer leads the dance with its loyal radioman without which the battle is lost. I have seen teams of players with awfull aim win the round just because the officer was working logically and the soldiers fighting constructively. The community has a great spirit, usually people are here to have fun instead of really winning.For the gameplay, I have spent many hours on DoD back in the day, and the spirit of that game is pretty much the same, with an additional realism to the battles (which DoD realy lacked). In-game, about 70% of the soldiers will fight with bolt-action rifles, which kind of regulates the pace of the battle : aim, shoot, hide, reload, aim, *head blows up*, wait for respawn. If you are bold you will your ennemies with the baionet, and then maybe die under a friendly artillery fire because you ran alone beyond the front line, whicih is anidvised since the front lines are very well defined by the topography and restricted areas.Overall it is a wonderfull good-looking game with a great gameplay dynamic involving team work and a lot of laughter with the teamates !"

,Recommended,447820,33741265,Posted: 23 July,all,Sgt. Ekholm,"This game is awesome! When there's a World War II FPS, I'm all for it! I love the asymmetrical setting and the WW2-era weaponry has always drawn me in the most. That being said, this game is brutally difficult; bullets kill you in 1 or 2 hits, there is no cross-hair, the UI is extremely minimal - you don't see your health nor is there regenerating health mechanic. Only way to heal is to either run to the spawn and resupply or hopefully your officer has called a supply drop which you can use as well.Did I say the game is brutally difficult? Yeah, some games I just spawn, follow my officer or other team-mates and hear this ""SCHWAP"" and next thing I'm dead by the sniper's bullet. :D But let me tell you, if your team actually plays together and plays the ♥♥♥♥ING OBJECTIVE (sometimes it infuriates me that people don't understand the concept of ""get on the goddamn point!""), it's truly a sight for the sore eyes! You advance as a group and you pay special attention to your officer who uses your radio to call in an smoke artillery, supply drop and whatever the else your team needs. You carefully work your way to the first objective (Invasion is my favourite gamemode) and eventually capture it - you hear ""good job"" on the VoIP and we start to advance the second objective.Stuff like that is awesome, I just wish it'd happened more often. Because sadly there isn't that many people playing the game (now that Dunkirk and Breville got added into map rotation I've seen a bit more players, but never saw 1k players online at the same time) it often turns out to ""♥♥♥♥ing noob"" call fests, where instead of providing some tips or tactic it just ends up being name-calling, negative attitude and sometimes outright toxic. But I guess this goes for FPS genre in general, but every now and then there's an awesome set of players playing together and voice chat is actually fun and informative... I just wish this would be the case a lot more often.Anyway, back to the game itself. Gunplay is awesome, classes feel different and the officer/radio coupling-up to call out airstrikes is awesome (game-winning, or losing if your team for some god awful reason don't chose them). M1 Garand goes PLING and tickles my nostalgia playing World at War back in the day. The map pool is relatively good, especially now that Dunkirk and Breville got instated - it's just that due to the voting system, you tend to see same maps over and over (Crete, Dog Red, Foy).The game's leveling system is mostly just cosmetic, as you randomly unlock units (different coat of arms and look for your guy) and you can only lock certain ones on certain ranks. They use common, uncommon and rare so it's RNG what you get. Awesome thing is, you get the access to all guns from the get-go - they are tied to classes and supply cost. The maps are mostly good in my eyes, they look pretty nice considering it's running on Source-engine. You can play both multiplayer or co-op, where you group up with a small number of people and play against an AI (which is relatively good). I play mostly multiplayer, but tried a bit of co-op as well and it was hella fun!Lastly, if you liked Insurgency you probably like this as well. I prefer Day of Infamy over Insurgency every day, World War II theatre is my thing! 19,99€ I spend on the game is/was worth every penny. GREAT GAME!"

There are about the same amount of automatic weapons on a team in Red Orchestra 2 which has teams of 32 while in RO 2 most people realistically have bolt action rifles.Overall i would say it is a good but not great fps and is a downgrade from insurgency and is a waterdowned run and gun version of Red Orchestra 2.

The brand-spanking-new dismemberment update also adds some extra grit and violence to the WW2 battlefield.  Fun to play competitively or in Co-op, but be warned, this game cheats...a lot...Also, the game is a little light on maps and weapons, but that's OK for now, as they keep adding in new stuff regularlyWhen you play co-op, especially when just playing an offline mission, the computer basically breaks its own rules.When you attack, the computer will spawn infinite defenders until you either win or (much more likely) get massacred...this means that your squad of 8-16 will get slowly ground down.  In one single round, I killed over 60 computer soldiers without having walked 20m away from my own spawn, and we never got within spitting distance of the objective.When you defend, the computer again sends you an insane amount of attackers, and although you can run back to get reinforcements, the amount of bots attacking basically prevents you from ever contesting the point, so be it by being wiped out or by losing the points, you'll lose unless perfectly co-ordinatedHowever all this aside, still a good game, might be worth a look"

,Recommended,447820,25105019,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,[50thGA.G] Cpt. Cullen,"Short summary at bottom.This game brings me back to the good old days when all you saw were World War 2 games, back before Call of duty and Medal of Honor went modern. Yes for a World War 2 buff like myself, it was the good old days!Now getting my bias feelings out of the way. I would like to say for an early access game it's pretty solid. I have only encountered five glitches, one being game breaking. The game breaking one being my weapon will start firing randomly without me even clicking the left mouse button. The times I have experienced this is after playing this game nonstop for hours. Which most don't do, and can easily be fixed by restarting the game. The second worst glitch of the five was the flamethrower sound when firing would continue until you respawn and fire it again, if you die firing it. The third glitch is again another flamethrower glitch, were the guy using the flamethrower looks like he's firing it when he's actually not. This becomes a vision problem for you if near them, but after they die or new round goes away. The last two was once no enemies spawned on co-op, and weird enviroment glitches; Example there was a tree that would spin round when moving around it, this is just funny and nothing that would ruin your gaming experience. All and all the experince with these glitches have been few and far between.My other problem with the game is the small opening rear sight on some of the guns, example being the M-1 Garand. This type of problem is a toss up to people though. In real life the rear sight for the Garand is a very small hole. Which in my opinion doesn't translate well because of the fact that in real life we have 2 eyes, and the tiny head adjustments we can make that can give us a better picture that a game can't give us when we fire at something. This problem can easily be fixed by a few workshop mods that make the rear sight opening bigger.Another problem for the game with me is the small amount of maps they have, and how small they are. But being an early access game, plus me being an Arma player, these things are expected.Other then these things the most frustrating thing about this game has been how good the AI is. Which isn't a problem with the game, unless your one who complains when you get shot because in your mind your the most MLG person ever, nothing can kill you and if something does it's the game being broken! The AI feels like your playing against actual players for the most part. They pre-fire sometimes around corners when they know your there. The gernade spam is sometimes real, and they duck when shot at. The only thing that makes it feel like AI is when you shoot at them they aren't moving back and forth while shooting at you.Hopefully this has helped someone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For an early access game this isn't all bad. There is only one gamebreaking glitch were you fire your weapon without pressing the left mouse button which can be easily fixed by restarting the game which doesn't take long at all. Other then this if your into games that teamwork is needed to give you a much better chance of success, and feeling like your in the action. Then this is the game for you."
,Recommended,447820,25356196,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,H.I. McDunnough,"The ultimate World War II game we never knew we neededI grew up with Day of Defeat and  Red Orchestra they were some of my favorite games as a kid.  When Insurgency came out a few years ago I fell in love with it the same way I did the classic games.  So, when I heard the Insurgency devs were essentially rebooting DoD I HAD to play it.  I haven't had this much fun in a WWII game since the early call of duty games.  Day of Infamy is like ARMA, CSGO, Insurgency, Call of Duty, and Insurgency all had a baby.  It is also quite different than Insurgency.  The mechanics are similar and the weapons and maps are obviously different and period correct.  They have also added Officers.  This new class can call in airstrikes along with the help of other squad mates with radios.  My only issue with the game is optimization.  It is in early access so it is to be expected, however much like Insurgency DoI pushes the capable but now very outdated Source engine to the MAX.  I have a beastly 1070 rig but the frame drops I get aren't on my end it is just the fact that Source can't handle all the fancy particle effects and textures the devs have added.  That being said, the framerate stays above 100 for me 65% of the time with semi-frequent dips to 50-60 in heavy battles with airstrikes.  I have heard the new Insurgency Sandstorm coming next year will utilize Unreal 4 engine.  I hope this will be transferred as well.  All in all if you enjoy fun and challenging FPS combat with a classic flair, look no further.EDIT:  The latest patch has fixed all optimization issues I had, excellent game.  Optimized more than Insurgency even!EDIT 2:  DAY OF INFAMY IS RELEASED!It was incredible to see the game evolve over the last few months.  I am so happy for New World Interactive.  So many games get stuck in Early Access forever.  They are a rare indie studio that puts so much time and effort into each of their releases.  The game is super optimized now and is officially out.  I really hope that DoI will get more attention now.  New World deserves it.Hands down the best use of 19.99 on Steam."

Having been swapping between ArmA III, BF4, Insurgency, and Company of Heroes 2 for entertainment the past few years, I have been waiting quite a while for a game that can bring factors of ArmA, BF, and Insurgency together. Day of Infamy has done this, and above all else has put the cherry on top by placing the setting in the both romantic and horrifying period of WWII. Everything feels right where it should be; the sounds, the animations, the gunfire, and the setting. The game itself is well-tailored to the audience it was created for.The first serious WWII FPS I completely remember playing through is CoD III, in 2006 on PS3. I can say Day of Infamy brings back nostalgia of the past while paving new and memorable times in the process. This is one for the history books. As my first review, I felt the need to congratulate the work of New World Interactive and proudly recommend this game to anyone interested in this nook of the gaming industry.It will be a great show to see how far New World Interactive can run with the torch."

I screamed out an enraged ""♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥!"" and as I reached for my second magazine, I watched another one of my mates burst into flames.It was as if I had locked eyes with the devil, thoughts of home rushed through my head as the flame turned and engulfed me.As the agonizing pain gripped my body, I heard a muffled voice call out, ""Command reports the enemy has captured Baker!"""

It is still in Beta and still a great shooter. Feels like a smaller scale version of rising Storm/ Red Orchestra 2 with some insurgency mechanics and its definitely worth picking up if you enjoy realistic shooters such as insurgency."

Avid PC gaming enthuist went nearly ecstatic when NWI announced the remake of the free mod ""Insurgency"". Problem was NWI didn't support the original supporters of the game. When it first released outside of beta and alpha it immediately went on sale for mere dollars or even cents. The end result was an infested semi-realistic modern combat shooter with COD players caring about one thing and one thing only: K/D. The end result was a game that saw one silly year of competitive play, and quickly followed by empty servers.I see the exact same thing happening with this game. People that picked up insurgency are just buying this game because it's NWI, and you see a lot of really ridiculous opinions of what this game should or shouldn't be. From weapon attachments to game modes, it feels as a general consensus more peopl want this to be a reskinned insurgency than an updated version of DOD. the reason people still play the original DOD is because it forces people to rely heavily upon working together, but right now DOI is nothing more than a modern shooter reskinned with better maps and more deadly weapons.Now on to the actual game. And I do want to emphasize this IS AN ALPHA RIGHT NOW, so all of this will probably change.The shotgun can kill someone in one hit from what feels like about 50 meters, and that is ok, because in real life that would be realistic. However once everyone figures this out everyone will be using this.The flamethrower, on the other hand feels to have about half or a third of what the real thing had, and it is extremely ineffective, leaves no burning particles for any time and honestly is no where near as scary as it should be for an entrenched position, as an MG, you should fear the flamethrower, but I've personally killed  every flamethrower that has attempted to flush me out because and MG 42 shoots and kills them faster than their flame can reach me and catch my clotches on fire. The flames also don't bend around corners quite as well as I would hope, making it not very useful for its intended purpose, however it is excellent at clearing trenches, or bunkers but just in a different fashion than what one would expect.The special weapons are quite overused, making me think some sort of lmitations should be set for how many there can be in a team. Personally I think germans should have more rifles, more MG's and more snipers, and only a select few MP-40's and STG 44's. On the other hand I think the Americans should have more M1 garands, less thompsons, and more m1a1 carbines. The british, pretty much should have a mix up of m1 garands enfield thompsons and Bren's as they had a pretty diverse group of weaponry for them. But I do not think the Lewis gun belongs in this game at all. It just didn't see as much use as what you see in videogames.So this is pretty much about as close to COD2 as you are gonna get without buying COD2. it's about the same weaponry diversity, and a little bigger size maps for the time being. I think with some tweaking this game can play more like what many would hope for which would be a reincarnation of a fun easy to learn WWII shooter such as DOD. where tactics and weapon placement plays the biggest role over who can twitch shoot the best.So right now I will suggest buying it, but just be careful, because as many of us were burned by insurgency, you might get burned if this game turns into a modern combat game lost in WWII."

Then, I found this game on NWI Pack. These first feelings about this game was amazing.What's good?The biggest plus in this game is detail attnetion. Firesupport reaction, smoke cough, amount of cartrigdes flys out as it supposed to be (M1 Garand and C96), reaction on burned teammates. Got wounded by flamethrower - your character will notice that in squad check-in. Uniform details are amazing - others players will see your division and rank on sleeves. Even dead animals - dead cows and dead fishes onPrimo VictoriaNormandy map.Some weapons are unavaliable in history cause (like StG 44 on 1940 year map).Atmosphere. Fighting againts krauts in rain, dirt, bodies everywhere, another MG starts shoot in your cover, bullets above your head. You feel hate againts your enemies. Firesupport sound effects are amazing, especially Stuka dive bomber.A lot of weapons.13 maps .Dunkirk update gave us2more maps.Firesupport. Want to bomb freakin' krauts? No problem. Wanna burn them with your white phosphorus artillery? No problem, you'll got it. Or maybe you wanna kill that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ in window with plane full of rockets? You just had to ask your favorite station boy.What's wrond?Game is very casual. Supression doesn't working, low recoil, auto weapons are not balanced, MG campers are everywhere.Also, there is not that much radio commands, 1-2 for each command. This is really annoying, you can even spam with ""Moving to obj."". Yeah, there is like 15 minutes of talking for 1 voice actor in total, but most of it you will hear in co-op. Insurgency had not this problem.Noobs are everywhere. There is no training camp mission, so you have to see how new players learning new stuff in game (ignoring main objective, teamkills, useless camping on respawn as sniper/mg, playing own game, especially as radioman - you will see this in 70% matches).NWI did great job, keep doing your free updates for game, I'm definitely gonna buy Insurgency: SandstormThanks God I didn't joked about Darude"

Go inside a building and throw a grenade, miss the throw and the nade bounces off the wall. We all have to run away outside. No one gets hit by my grenade, for a fact, not even me. Teammate NOOT NOOT shoots me in the head with garand and team kills me. I ask why. ""Well....you kind of deserved it, for poor leadership."" I say ""I see the Insurgency community hasn't changed."" I respawn. He is in the spawn, and throws a grenade at me. I run up to him and shoot him in the face and kill him. The grenade explodes in our spawn and thankfully doesn't hit anyone.He immediately cries and initiates a votekick and says that I ""teamkilled 2 people."" I TKed one person, the person who TKed me on purpose, him. I call him a c*nt, and get votekicked. I come back and play for another hour.Welcome to DoI, the Insurgency community is still full about 20% rude trolls who need to be euthanized, nothing has changed on that front since I wrote a review of Insurgency. They seem to stick to co-op though.As for DoI itself it has now moved from a mod for Insurgency to a standalone game and I really am not sure it's worth full price. Maybe a loyalty discount for Insurgency would have been nice. They've added many new weapons, far more classes, more maps, and you can now call in artillery strikes - as can the enemy, both human and AI in co-operative mode. The gun models have been improved since the mod and they even put in the Springfield model finally.The game works more or less pretty solidly - although there are a lot of bounding box / clipping issues that I don't remember being present in Insurgency. It's the same engine and basically the same game so it feels weird that beta has some of these issues. It has crashed on me one time so far, not sure why, but it has otherwise been stable.Most importantly, now you can run around with a bolt action and not feel like you're going to die from ISIS spam like when you would run around with an iron sight Mosin in Insurgency (if you were badass) and have to be extremely good to survive, and have a lot of luck.The only complaint I have is that rifle grenades have no way to be properly aimed and are a danger to your team until you learn the exact arc you need to aim at. And the kar is absolute trash - both the scoped and unscoped. They are severely inaccurate to the point where you can have your scope dead on someones chest and they are standing still, and it misses. Hopefully that will be sorted out. Achievements also do that weird thing from Insurgency where they don't pop up until the next match after you actually earned them."

If you have played Insurgency expect the same visual appeal. Audio is also on par with Insurgency.The visuals are very good for an aging engine and do the job quite well. Dynamic visuals such as explosions, smoke grenades, and even gunfire look very well placed in the game and can be quite spectacular at times.Sound is no different. Firearms for the most part give out a sound that is satisfactory for the type of firearm you are carrying. Some sounds I would like to see improved upon. Especially rifles and LMGs. But for the Early Access build they do the job well enough.Gameplay Mechanics.The gameplay is a lot like Insurgency and being in the same engine you will find it to be very much alike. However, things do tend to get more tense in using 70 year old firearms. Especially if you get tangled up into a firefight with your rifle. The game gives off an old Day of Defeat vibe. Pre-Steam. Pre-Source Day of Defeat that is. Which makes things very satisfying and brings me back. Movement controls are heavily editable in the options and the familiar moves such as sliding and leaning are all present.Gunplay needs some tweaking. More so in some departments than others. But most of the guns feel very good and the hits seem to register quite well. Again, referring to Insurgency for the mechanics here.Some things do bother me, however. Like being able to run around with an MG42 using it like an assault rifle. Hopefully this is addressed in the future and LMGs receive some tweaking depending on the type of firearm they are.There are currently three nations. United States. Commonwealth. Germany. They all play slightly different depending on the team as their weapons vary quite differently. Getting used to this simply requires hands on experience in the game.For now the gameplay is solid. The game modes are all fun. From the adversial battles to the COOP battles.Features.I have yet to explore all of the features in the game. But I have managed to play with most of the weapons. There is a large variety of weapons from the terrifying flamethrower to the standard issue rifle. Each class has a variety of weapons and while some classes use similar weapons - classes like the engineer can put a rifle grenade launcher onto their rifle. Etc. The addons to your weapons are a bit lackluster but with it being WW2 - there's not much you can really do considering.You also have the ability to use radios, chat locally over voice (the enemy can hear you also) as well as call in artillery. All of the standard weapons from the three nations you will expect to encounter are in the game. For Early Access there is plenty of weapons to use here.LMGs also can utilize bipods on ledges and while prone. Which is great!There are a handful of maps currently. The maps for the most part play pretty well. But there are a couple beach landing maps (Sicily and Dog Red) that get really difficult for the allies. D-Day and beach landings are always popular for this type of game and I understand it. But sometimes I wish for a bit more in terms of D-Day maps. Such as paratrooper engagements on land or the battles further inland directly after the invasion. With the Commonwealth ingame, I would love to see a Pegasus Bridge map.What I'd like to see in the Future.I am a historical reenactor and I love WW2 games. That being said I do have a few different views on how I would like to see the game progress in the future. Here's some suggestions.- Different animations for running.This is a big one for me that I think can reduce friendly fire incidents. Germans were trained very specific on how to carry their weapons on the move. In one hand at their side. Not only would this add some realism but could add in helping with indentifying enemy troops on the field.- Tweak LMG mechanics.LMGs are glorified assault rifles right now. I have handled and carried an MG42 on the field. They are heavy, bulky, and the recoil would not make this a viable option. I am not asking to take away hip fire completely - it just should be something considered for emergencies and not a viable tactic.- More nations as the game smooths out.Once the gameplay mechanics get smoothed out and things get rolling. It'd be amazing to see an Eastern Front addition or a Pacific Addition to the game.- Limit Classes and Weapons.Would love to see this perhaps as a server option. The rifle should be the standard issue weapon on the field. With other weapons holding a more specialized role.- German Engineers.Check out the German Pionier Assault Packs. Would love to see German engineer kits looking more like that to give a sense of realism!- Maps Beyond the Norm.Would love to see maps based on some of the lesser seen battles or perhaps maps of more generic nature. Such as a bocage style setting, German offensive maps. Etc.Conclusion:Day of Infamy brings back some solid Day of Defeat vibes with a taste of new age technology and ideas. A new WW2 shooter is very rare these days and with our current technology in the form of gaming engines we are far overdue for something great. While I would love to see a WW2 game based around combined arms (Infantry, Tanks, vehicles, etc) this squad based tactical shooter is solid and plays very well. I recommend supporting the early access.Also, if you have Insurgency already, they have decided to be completely awesome and give you a discount on Day of Infamy. Now that is cool."

I also recommend that as well :D), this game peaked my interest as a modern WWII shooter I have been long awaiting. As a comparison, I've played every mainstream Call of Duty and Battlefield since their originals, as well as the old Medal of Honor games on the PS2. The only hardcore-style FPS I've played is Verdun (and now obviously Insurgency).This was definitely a surprise.I'm obviously not used to this level of realism in a game. The slow reloads, both fellow and enemy soldiers yelling to each other constantly, and, of course, the instant deaths from one or two bullets immersed me unlike any other game, despite it's extremely recent early access release on Steam. I haven't played too many matches online to be perfectly honest, but I haven't been met with too many players using mics. Despite the lack of communication, however, it takes easy-to-learn game sense to understand when to pop your head up out of cover, when to rush or flank the enemy, or when to wait for your teammates to move forward towards the objective.Singleplayer is where I'm finding most of my joy in the game as of now. Sure you will find your common glitches and bugs as you always will in an early access game, and I have full confidence the developers will get on them as quick as they can. I can't wait for this to become a fully fledged game, and I highly recommend this to anyone who is remotely interested.Thanks for reading my first review :D"

In my 2 hours of playing I have:Stormed the beaches of NormandyDefended the beaches of NormandyHad an hour long talk with a dev that was in a multiplayer server at 3 A.M (very nice guy btw)Lived through the absolute horror that is warOk so first off, this game is amazing, so if you don't really care about specifics, just buy it now you most likley won't regret it. The devs interact with the community through actual in game play, which is amazing. Sure there are some FPS issues but it is an early alpha, and in talking with the dev he said over time it will be fixed. And for everyone that will write a review saying ""the maps are so one sided defence always wins"" - that is intentional. The game is set up for the defenders to have an advanage, thus making it harder to attack and feeling rewarded once you cap an objective. The dev also stated that in the alpha state the game is currently as balanced as they can get it, again be patient and things will be sorted out. Now onto the gameplay itself. All of the voice acting/overs are amazing and super immersive. Allies will yell voice lines depending on what they are doing (like getting shot, reloading, being suppressed etc.) Having shot many of the weapons in game in real life (M1 Garand, Sten, Kar98k, MP40, MG42/34, STG44, Thompson, and a few others) I must say the weapon sound effects and recoil patterns are very accurate.Overall I give the current alpha state a solid 8.5/10Very good gameplay overall with some few expected bugs and optimization issues. If you have a lower end PC I would wait for some more updates before buying if you want the best experience. I exceed reccomended requierments and I cruise at around 55-70 FPS on medium settings out of combat and 40-60 in combat."

For what it is and the price you pay, it is well worth a buy and look. The aesthetics are not bad and provide a really good glimpse at World War Two combat. Not to say that it is an exact copy of said combat, that's one hell of a tall order, but it gets it done in a fun and realistic way. The weapons are nearly exact models of their real life counterparts and are fairly damn close to fire rate, reload times, recoil, and even power. You get shot once by a bolt action rifle, you're dead. You get shot by with a submachine gun and are lucky to have lived or found cover, you feel the effects. Whether that be varied slower movement speed, fogginess in vision, or even your soldier starting to shout in fear of their life. Speaking of the character voicing, it is spot on. The American forces sound as WW2 soldiers would sound. Commonwealth Forces sound a bit funny at times by what they say, but realistic in accents for British, Australian, Indian, etcetera. Lastly and my personal favorite, the German Wehrmacht speak correct and fitting German. All around, this game provides excellent oppurtunity for any FPS fan to enjoy a game with a WW2 timeframe. It has its flaws, like a few incorrect uniforms, lack of maps and battles which would be great if added, and the occasional buggy AI if you're playing Co-Op. Overall though, it is a very creative game that doesn't hold your hand in combat and feels smooth. It has many great little details that are appreciated for being added in. Definitely worth a pick up for any WW2 combat enthusiast."

The game brings with it realistic damage scales (meaning 1-2 shots with any weapon will kill), bullets go through certain materials, suppression under fire, bullet travel time and scope sway. It's not like Team Fortess 2 or Counter-Strike, and is rather slow paced due to the mentioned realism it brings, as you are guaranteed to get killed running across a large field in seconds. Teamwork is at the game's core. Classes play a major role in capturing points and pushing forward. New additions to the game, are aerial strikes by way of radio calls, more distinguished classes, new weapons, units and armies, certain unlockable achievement weapons, flamethrowers and new maps.

On first sight, the graphics can look a bit dated, and I had to ask myself whether it was worth $20.  But once it went on sale for $11, I decided that I might as well try it out.  Let me tell you, I'm glad I did.Overview - Day of Infamy, in brief terms, is a tactical, cinematic, team oriented first-person shooter where map knowledge and cooperation really matter.  Bullet damage is realistic, so 1-2 shots from most weapons will end you.  There are nine different classes, each with an important role to play.  Officers, for example, can call in a variety of airstrikes.  However, they need to have a Radioman nearby to do so.  Radiomen also capture points faster than other classes.  Riflemen are best in close-medium range combat, wielding a bolt-action rifle.  Engineers are great for taking out objectives with the variety of explosives they have at their disposal.  I'm not going to get into every class, otherwise this review would turn into an essay.  There are 8 different game modes spanning across single-player, co-op, and multiplayer matches.  It worth noting that some game modes are not playable on some maps.Graphics | 6/10 - The graphics are the main reason that most people would turn a blind eye to this game.  In my opinion, the graphics suit the game.  But there isn't any denying that they do look dated, as the game runs on source engine, which is 13 years old now.  Needless to say, this game should run fine on most lower end gaming PC's.Gameplay | 9/10 - The gunplay in this game is simply amazing.  I have seen lots of people saying that it's really similar to insurgency.  While I personally have not played insurgency, I can assure you that it's as good as people say.  There are very few glitches worth noting.  Sometimes you will have trouble fitting through a door, but it’s not really a big deal.Single-Player | 8/10 - This game is primarily meant to be played online.  Needless to say, you can still have a lot of fun in the single-player, or ""Practice Mode"" as the game likes to call it.  You can play on any map on any game mode, change the amount of A.I. you fight, or the number of lives you have (depending on the game mode).  The bots are super smart and challenging to play against.Co-op | 9.5/10 - In my opinion, this is where the game really shines.  In co-op, you are tasked with either attacking, or defending a set of objectives with a group of people against A.I. opponents.  As I stated above, the bots are really challenging to play against, so you and the other players aren't going to be able to go on a killing spree.  Sure, you'll get more kills in co-op than in multiplayer, but it’s not a huge increase.  Most of the people I’ve played with have been nice and respectable.  The friendly fire can be a bit annoying for some of the tankier classes, such as the machinegunner and flamethrower, but it’s nothing to worry about.  Overall, a great experience.Multiplayer | ?/10 - I haven't really played this part of the game yet, so I don't think I am qualified to review it.  Once I do get around to playing a few matches, I will update this review.Other Things - The game has a progression system where you level up to different ranks.  You can unlock ""Units"" which are a set of uniforms that go to a specific faction.  There are also weapons skins/camo’s.  When you first start the game, I would recommend playing the single-player to get familiar with the maps.  As I stated above, map knowledge is really important.  Also, if you are looking for a game where you can go it alone, this isn't the game for you.  Teamwork is necessary if you are to succeed.Verdict - This game is worth the $20.  Hell, it’s almost as good as some of the AAA shooters, such as Battlefield 1.  The tactical, strategic gameplay, combined with the intense, cinematic moments make this game one to remember."

My first negative review.I'll start off by telling you that this game is awesome.  It has a ton of potential.PROS:-It's basically a remake of Day of Defeat, with very similar mechanics.-You can play as U.S., British, and German.-The buildings, character models, animations, sound fx, landscape are all beautifully done.-Gameplay is great, although some maps are slightly one-sided.-There is some work to be done on the movement (running/crouch/peek/setting bipod/getting stuck on corners), it still plays very nicely.CONS:-There is a severe shortage of players on servers.  Basically there is no online community (maybe 90 players MAX in regular game servers on any given night.)-The game is lacking content.  There are few maps, few game modes, and it gets very repetitive.-There is no ranking system.  There is no feature to track your stats at the moment, and everyone has the same access to weapons/attachments.And the final nail in the coffin for me:They unexpectedly added BattlEye as their mandatory anti-cheat software. There isn't even a cheating problem on this game yet.  I could go on about why I don't trust the invasive software, but I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not it's for you.Unless they make big changes to the game sometime soon, I won't be recommending this game to anyone."

Inexplicable it uses a jump instead of a climb/vault functionality....which is a bit old fashioned for a game.The graphics, are not great, but they get the job done.The sound is pretty ""Authentic"" in that they clearly sampled or got samples of the historic weapons being fired. But it's postiuonal sound in headphones is not great but also not bad.The co-op mode is not good. Maybe useful to warm up your aim, but its not good.The player base, in the week I've played has been becoming steadily more toxic, and if you're not a fan of completely unmoderated Screen names, you might need to give this game a skip.At times it does capture the feel of being a in a large battle and running through smoke and artillery fire. But after a while being killed by the incessant RNG that is artillery/air strikes gets old and tedious. Sometimes, if you're really unlucky you'll be inside a bunker when an airstirke kills you. Getting randomly shot through smoke, while realistic gets old after a while too. While the respawn cycle does sort of promote ""Tactical"" play, its not like ARMA levels of tactical.Inexplciably for an objective based game that involves a lot of brute force capture of objectives, it still tracks KdR....which in turn promotes a ""Selfish"" style of play. Seems unessecary.....but I gues that stat matters to a lot of players?The weapons do capture the feel of their real life counterparts. On the whole, the presentation is atmospheric. THe voice acting is better than you'd expect...though, once again, not great. The game also has a really great number of maps and modes for variety.I got it for 15 dollars and at that price point it feels alright. Depending on your love of WW2 or how much you like the  older style source shooter mechanics, this game might even be worth the full 20 dollars for you.I'm going to down vote this, not because I think you shouldn't buy it, but because I think as an FPS it will have a more niche appeal and that should be considered. Of course its future success will also depend on how much of a player base it retains. (since steam lacks a more a robust rating option.)I certainly intend to keep playing the game from time to time, but its way too frustrating to  become a ""main shooter""."

I have played since the mod, early access and through to retail. The gameplay has only gotten better with everything they've added and updated, there's a nice variety of maps and modes, definitely enough to keep you busy.Unfortunately at the moment I wouldn't recommend it. The game crashes a lot and much like Insurgency, the performance is not great. My system is far above the recommended specification and the FPS is all over the place.

It has great optimization and little demand as a result but they just don't hold up. I mean I can over look them but I really feel like I'm playing a Medal of Honor game in 2006. Especially when storming beaches and stuff. It's not a reason not to buy it and enjoy it but something to note. The sound effects are amazing though. First time I was taking cover in front of a tank and heard the spackle of enemy fire on the other side was great. Explosions are low and bassy. It's good stuff. The shooting and mechanics are still Insurgency like, which is perfect of course. I do wish, at least on recruit difficulty there was a kill cam though. I know people that worship these types of shooters hate those but I do think one of it's biggest cons (and pros at same time) is getting killed from who the hell knows where. It's especially common as all the levels have long sights lines (a pro) an awkward old school cover system (though you can still lean thankfully) and realistic bullet physics. With the realism and fast pace of the game, campers don't stay around too long. All in all it's exactly what I was hoping these devs would do with their next game. I just hope they achieve better geometry and particle effects with the engine as development moves along. Some tessellation would go a long way in helping make the buildings and debris look more real to fit with the mechanics of the game. It's an instant buy if you're into realistic, more tactical MP shooters. Especially at the fair, non greedy asking price. You also want be DLC ♥♥♥♥♥d or see microtransactions.

There a few issues to it but overall pretty much as good as Insurgency. Map design is killer as usual, bombardments are awesome in a frightening way, and the guns are pretty cool. On to the issues. The ragdolls are pretty awful, every bot dies in the same exact way. They go rigid with their arms out then fall awkwardly to the ground. Not a big issue but something I'd like to see fixed. The second issue is lack of customization. You pretty much get a vanilla gun and that's it. Only gun you can get a scope for is the sniper rifle. I know that scopes weren't really used as often back then, but using an M1 with only an ironsight feels like a waste. Not asking for modern sights or anything, just sights appropriate to the time period. I can run the game pretty well on my bad computer, I haven't encountered any major bugs, crashes, FPS drops etc. For an early access game it is very well done. Keep in mind the issues I have the game will probably be ironed out as the development progresses. If you're looking for a shooter solely focused on realism, an authentic WW2 game, or just a game to shoot up some bad guys, you'll probably have a good time with this game. This style of shooter isn't for everyone though, if you like fast paced action and fast paced games you will probably not have fun with this game. As I said the focus is realism so you will be moving slowly through buildings with your squad clearing them out, or holding a position for 10 minutes against an assault. Overally a very polished game for early access that if you think you will enjoy you probably will.♥♥♥♥♥♥Computer Rating a biased 8/10."

Notable gameplay features include:- Class based gameplay with limitations on amount of players per class (except for Rifleman). Much like the Rising Storm/Red Orchestra series.- Team Commander class must partner up with a Radioman (another class) to call for air support.- Flamethrowers.- Aiming deadzone when not aiming down a gun's sights (which means your fire is not directed toward the center of the screen when not aiming).- Deployable bi-pods.- Picture-in-picture scopes.$20 for this vs $60 for an AAA shooter like CoD: WWII with inferior mechanics, less content, less weapon variety, no modding and probably no dedicated servers, and black female Nazis... no brainer."

Another great part, in my opinion, is that there are no cross airs and no telling how much more shots you have in a clip. This really makes you feel like an actual soldier and also helps with not allowing single players to go out Rambo style killing all the enemy forces.

What has been lacking on the market in recent years is a good WW2 shooter. I am one of the oldies that remembers the original DOD pre source betas.If you like the COD and DOD then this game will be the next evolution, Yes there are bugs but even at this stage it seems quite stable after four hours play no issues. I like the solo mode as it give you a chance to get use to the maps, feel of the game and how the weapons react. But dont expect to win the enemy are very unforgiving.Multi player works well so far not been able to find a server in classic mode with players on it but there are a few in GRIT mode this to me is pretty much a standard game play so expect the odd TK!Game play is as important if not more important that the graphics and in my opinion this game delivers well on gameplay if you can look past the graphics and take a chance I dont think you will be disapointed.Is it worth the Early access price point?

The game play is very realistic and nothing like call of duty where everyone is rushing and dying and then respawning and doing the same exact thing.The sounds for Day of Infamy are very, very well done. The sounds of the characters yelling during the amazing sounds of artillery crashing into the ground, to the amazing gun sounds when shooting any gun.I would highly recommend this game to anyone.

I was an officer during the Normandy invasion of Dog Red sector on June 6th 1944. Bullets riddled the sand beneath me as I pulled the radioman to my side and grabbed the microphone from his waistband. ""This is Squad Lead! We need an IMMEDIATE smoke barrage on this location!"". I was sure they could hear the screams of dying soldiers over the static of the connection, yet they still responded with ""No can do, Squad Leader! Godspeed!"". That was it. I wasn't going to die here. Not now, when we'd come so far and lost so many men on the beach. I yelled out to the few surviving soldiers around me ""Alright men! Grab whatever utilities you can find! Grenades, smoke, ammunition, anything""! As they scrambled to loot their comrades corpses I peeked my head up over the sand shelf we were hiding in. I saw similar situations happening around me. Frantic soldiers desparately trying to maintain a push on our objective; the weapons cache. They all failed. I watched good men die as their leaders persuaded them to rush into hailstorms of lead. I was about to do the same to these men. I had to make the decision right there. Could we do it? We had no more reinforcements, and no reason to believe we could...but I felt it. I had hope. A tap on my shoulder and an artillery round blasting the dirt 10 feet away from me into the air brought me out of my shock. ""Ok, Squad Lead, we're all geared up..."" I took one last look at the private's scared eyes before ordering my men to run out of the trench and into the hail of gunfire for their country. I hoisted myself over the barbed wire with my gun drawn, machine guns laid down covering fire as we pushed up. The private who's eyes I had just locked with was gunned down in a flurry of bullets not 2 feet away from me. Time slowed. I knew I had to do something. We had reached the last point to rest before our final push to the cache. Gunfire threw up sand around my ringing ears, yet all I could hear was the pounding of my heart in my chest. I grabbed a grenade off my belt. Not today. Not like this. I dug my feet into the sand and pushed off, running at top speeds. I could feel bullets ripping through my arms, but I didn't care. I had to save these people. I pulled a grenade off of my belt with the stump of a hand I had left and pulled the pin before diving into the machine gun nest head first, grenade still firmly grasped in my palm."

These players are mostly in the US, I live in NZ so the game become pretty unplayable with the lag if I join a US server. Single player only offers so much fun.I really wish more people would play this game, it really is a fun WW2 shooter and I had a blast playing this game.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW.The dev's behind this game are the dev's behind Insurgency, one of my fave MP shooters.I would just like to say that, in its current state I am experiencing a few frame rate drops here and there (everything is on max) my system is pretty damn good as well, hopefully the dev's optimize the game more through future updates.DoI, like Insurgency, is a basic MP FPS. No killstreaks, just you, your weapon(s) and your team. Pure boots on the ground gameplay. This game is pretty much a mix of Insurgency, Day of Defeat and Counter Strike, it's somewhat realistic and the firefights can be fun and intense, especially when you get supressed.Definitley buy this game if you are a fan of Insurgency, or, if you want a WW2 multiplayer shooter. This game is only an alpha currently so it can be a tad glitchy. In 3 hours of playing the game it's crashed once and I have been unable to fire my gun properly or aim down the sights on two seperate occasions during firefights, which was frustrating, the voices and sound has glitched out a few times as well but came back with a few seconds.I do like that the game already has mod support and I am very excited that this game has a singleplayer mode (offline MP with bots basically). I live in NZ and I only enjoy playing with 32 players. in Insurgency, there are only 1-2 servers available for me to play on because all other servers are American or European, so my ping ends up being 400+ which is a nightmare, making the game unplayable sometimes, so I really am glad this game allows me to play in offline matches.Looking forward to see the final version of this game, I hope more people buy it in the near future."

It's intense, entertaining, and offers a kind of realism that i've never seen attempted in games. Rather than rely on the nausea goggle camera schemes of Arma the game offers a fluid feeling of movement and an aiming system that actually goes some ways towards emulating the feeling of holding a gun.The sound design is spot on barring some less than stellar voice deliveries. The actual gameplay is excellent, maps are built around objectives and chokepoints that encourage teamplay and communication, you can't just solo any part of the game, you need to work as a group to get it done.So based on this review you probably assume I love the game, and you'd be correct. So why am I giving it a ""not recommended"" score? Because the GNU/Linux version is f­ucking broken. It's downright unplayable and they've done nothing to fix that. I've tried every number of fixes and nothing will change the fact that your radial menu doesn't work and the performance is pre-alpha level.I say this as an original backer of the game and long time supporter of the project even back when it was a mod.FIX YOUR S­HIT."

RO2 is superior in every aspect of DOI.Pro's+Gun models and reload animations are really well done.+Class customization is good.+Team Play. The thing i really liked is that as a Radioman you have to be near a Commander otherwise he can't call artillery or supplydrops.Neutral~There are microtransactions but the good thing is that it is just cosmetics for example diffrent units like 101st Airborne or Fallschirmjäger. The skins are not immerse breaking like pink weapon skins or a clown mask which is really good and i wanna see these kinda cosmeticsts in other games. Alternatively you can unlock the units by leveling so that is well done.Con's-Didn't liked the gunplay at all.-Not really noob friendly.-The Performance is meh for a game that is running on the source engine and a PC like mine. I got microstutters without vsync being on. Maybe thats just me i cant speak for everyone.-Not many maps.I didn't got any Day of Defeat vibes from this even with the map Salerno which is a DOD map. Alot of people like this because of the nostalgia but i didn't.Overall it's not a bad game it's just i didn't liked it.

,Not Recommended,447820,31866438,Posted: 20 May,all,iliekP3aches,"ORIGINAL REVIEW: If you enjoy Insurgency you will probably enjoy DOI. It's rare to find a game that finds a good balance between realism and fun, but this does it for me. Sounds are top notch and gunplay is good. Weapons actually feel like they have power behind them. A couple of the maps feel a bit unbalanced, and there is an occasional lag problem for me, but otherwise I would very much recommend.EDITED:After a longer length of play time I have to add some cons to this. The game is still pretty buggy and poorly optimized. Lots of jitter, lag, and seemingly broken hit detection. Sometimes flames will catch instantly, sometimes you can hose a guy down and he'll manage to shoot you while using the flamethrower. Saw a guy take out three enemies with a single shotgun blast. Sometimes a nade will land next to you and you take it just fine while your ally far across the courtyard dies from it. I once even managed having my fuel tank shot, spewing flames everywhere and walked away fine from it.Basically what I'm trying to say is that often the game will sometimes just not work right and you'll be left with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths you don't feel are deserved as well as kills that are unsatisfying.Other cons are weapons. Insurgency has a good balance of weapons on each side, but DOI seems to just throw whatever seems cool. Some weapons are just utter♥♥♥♥♥♥or are redundant like the Commonwealth assault having 3 SMG choices. No one uses the Owens. You can run around and rambo with the MG42, but the other faction MGs are useless. Seriously, being a static MG is a death sentence. You're lucky if you get a couple kills before anyone, even an SMG kills you from across the map. Games like DOD and Red Orchestra managed to keep the arsenals balanced, but DOI doesn't seem to be able to do that.Another addition: Ping is everything. I notice that when I stay under 40 ping servers everything runs flawlessly. No seemingly BS deaths, often I come out the victor in an encounter. But as soon as I jump to 40-100 ping deaths routinely come. You'll get seen before you see the enemy, enemies will pop in, bullets will reg poorly, bunch of stuff like that. And considering that this game emphasizes pixel hunting and near instant kills it can be very frustrating. I'm changing my review to not recommended because of all the annoying issues."

76561197977820099,Recommended,447820,26329101,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Lizzard,"Once upon a time on a Windows 98 PC far, far away, there was a game called Half Life. A couple of years after this game matured, a small band of people joined forces and created a few maps and some new features they released as a mod. This is what they called ""Day of Defeat"" - a WWII era, ""Half Life"" mod.When Steam was created, the mod was transferred to the new platform and released as a stand-alone game and people began playing it by the hundreds. Then, as interest slowly waned, Source was created and the old game became an updated, stand-alone game on Source. Many people, however, were either still playing the original release, or didn't want to fork out money for a slightly nicer looking version of a free game they had been playing for years before.Now we have ""Day of Infamy"". This is not a ""Day of Defeat"" mod being sold as a separate game. This is, most definitely a game unto itself, built off the game, ""Insurgency"".This is a brutal, realistic, blood-soaked, team based WWII shooter. You'll realize just how brutal it is once you see your first German leg land next to your machine gun nest. Or the brain splatter on the wall behind the American you just sniped from a blown out, second story window.If you've played Day of Defeat, this is the game you should turn your attention to. If you've played any of the more modern combat games and felt they were lacking, this is the game you should be turning your attention towards.There is no ""easy"" mode. There is no auto-aim. There are no magical cross-hairs hovering on your screen. Every gun doesn't have 16x magnification. This isn't a ""Battlefield"" game.However, this isn't an ultra hard-core, tactical, squad-based alternative reality game like ""ARMA"". Concessions are made to make it enjoyable without giving in to the excessive realism crowd. Bullet drop is moot since the open areas aren't large enough to make a difference. If you can't jump an obstacle, you can't climb over it like other games. Reloading and animations don't take ages to complete. Walls don't crumble and fall down or can be shot through like in some newer games.Despite that, this game feels much more realistic than the others do and your ability to ""play the game"" rather than ""play the gimmicks"" offers a much more satisfying reward. That's not to say that it is without its flaws.The most obvious first impression will leave people with an ""Oh my God, what have I done?"" feel, so I'm going to lay it out for you now - the graphics are dated. We're talking about Half Life 2 era graphics in all of their DX 9.0c glory. They're on par with the original Mount & Blade, so they aren't bad, but they're a far cry from the modern norm.Bots are good... too good. Playing a round with bots is essentially playing a round with a bunch of head-shooting, wall-hackers. They make you feel like a human going up against an Agent in the Matrix and only dumb luck or a massive waste of ammunition and explosives will kill them.The game would also benefit hugely from being a true MMO style game that tracked stats and had some form of player progression. Not that logging in here and there to blow people's legs off isn't fun, but with so many titles out there these days that save a player's stats and progress, the lack of it in a game like this is noticeable. (And yes, I am fully aware that the original DoD didn't do this either)So now, for all of you thinking, ""Pffft. This guy only has 2 hours invested."" I will remind you that this game was released as ""Day of Defeat"" back in 2000. Upon its migration to Steam in 2004, I had 800+ hours racked up (tracked via my clan's server Web site). After its migration, I still had another 300+ hours. The core game to ""Day of Infamy"" is the same as ""Day of Defeat"", with some updates and modernization made to it. Any experience you had in one, will quickly transfer to the other.So enjoy! And I hope to see you in game so I can repaint a room with your blood and blow some limbs off your corpse!"

,Recommended,447820,24602841,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,Dr. Potato,"DISCLAIMER - THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY FOR COOP AS I DO NOT PLAY MULTIPLAYER.I have been craving a World War II setting FPS game for a very long time and I'm very happy to say that Day of Infamy does not disappoint.I rate this game at launch a solid 8/10.PROS-Gun variety- There are a lot more guns in this stand alone version of the game than there are in the DOI mod for Insurgency.Factions- Not only do you get to play as the U.S army, but you also get to play as the Commonwealth Army(British) and the Wehrmacht(German Army). Hopefully we get to see the Red Army and the Imperial Army sometime in the future.Maps- There are a total of six maps with three of them originally coming from the DOI mod.Graphics- Don't let the screenshots deter you away from the game. DOI is absolutely beautiful in-game. Looks ten times better than Insugency and I can't wait to see what other maps they are going to add in the future.Sounds- The game sounds are wonderful. All three factions are fully voice overed and have multiple phrases which put you right into the action. Hearing and seeing the bullets crack and whiz right you past you while you are pinned down trying to capture an objective definitely makes you panic and gives you an authentic WWII experience.CONS-No Party system- Lack of a party system to get all you friends together to join in a game at the same time is a downgrade. Friends and I have to either join a game together either through steam friends or through the server browser which can get confusing at times if they don't remember which server they clicked. Hopefully this is changed in a future patch.Weapon Customization- I know this is a WWII based game but it would have been nice for a few more customizations especially for the rifles, and bolt actions.(THIS HAS BEEN FIXED WITH THE AUGUST 5TH PATCH) Spawning- This is for the AI. The AI spawning is a little broken on some maps during certain objectives. For instance, on the map titled ""Comaccio"" with the game mode, ""Stronghold"" after you take objective ""B"" in the house where Objective ""D"" is the AI is constantly spawning on the first floor that building. This is where it is a little broken, if you are able to get yourself a flamethrower and are can get into the house before your team captures ""B"" you can stand on the staircase and spawn kill all of the AI with your flamethrower which makes the objective very easy to captureCONCLUSION-If you are looking for an authentic World War 2 FPS experience then look no further. Day of Infamy may be in Alpha and may have some bugs to fix but is overall one of the best games I have played this year.And, with New World Interactive's track record I know that they are just getting started on this gem of a game and are going to keep improving it and making it better and better just like they did with Insurgency."
,Recommended,447820,33332599,Posted: 6 July,all,Herman,"This is a game with 3 factions, US army, Commonwealth and Axis, it would be even better if this game included the USSR and Japan Empire infantries but it’s ok in my opinion. There are no hubs or anything to indicate if you killed enemy or not, you have to be cautious because you could kill accidentally your teammate, this is like playing hardcore Call of Duty, no indicators, no bullet counting, no name tags, only a map and a compass. I like it because it challenges you to really think and make decisions strategically, I always wanted to play something like this and I’m happy that I got this game. Most of the matches are about capturing a zone, but you are limited to die a number of times, if you waste your chances the opposition wins.Controls are pretty much like Call of Duty series, you can prone, crouch, aim and hold breath, sprint, etc. Each faction has 9 classes by default and you could modify the loadout depending on how much weight the soldier can carry. Weapons like: guns, submachine guns, heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, grenades, smoke grenades, sniper rifles, flamethrowers, etc. Also you can call bombers to bomb zones on the map.Pros:Simple and nice game for first person shooter.Control feeling is good.Many weapons and combinations to configure the load out.Immersive play style.Voice commands to alert your team.Very good voice acting.Cons:The menu interface is very buggy, it crashed me like 5 times and I had to remake the load out again.Configuring controls is complicated, not much explanation, not very intuitive.The texts of the interface are ridiculously tiny, maybe it was to give the game a retro style, but those are very minuscule.Graphics are not the best, but in my opinion I don’t mind about fancy graphics, just informing that if you max out the graphics is not like you will get the best, but still not bad."

It is very responsive. Also, the map detail and art assets are great, even though this is running on an older Source engine, the excellent sound and audio help create a level of immersion.Ultimately, this is an arcade semi-tactical shooter. The thing is the gameplay, while visceral, is not necessarily new. For me, the best game that matched this level of lethality and accessability really was Red Orchestra OstFront. This gets close, but doesn't have the same scope.Still, it has that 'classic' FPS feel from the older WWII CoD games, Wolfenstein, and Day of Defeat."

Definitely not a fan.Sometimes have to wait 2 minutes or more depending on how many people die.I feel it could use a little faster, maybe 30 seconds, 45 max when you aren't on the hardcore game types.Overall highly recommended for any WWII fan.

In the short, if you like the gameplay style of Insurgency, you will most likely enjoy this game.  This game is simply brilliant.  This game has a great community and active developers.  The game supports workshop mods, and there are many, many, many of them.  While most first person shooters are incredibly fast paced, run and gun, and hack and slash, Day of Infamy is different.  I have played multiple ""realistic"" shooters and they do not give the same feel as this game.    This game gives a feeling of sheer terror as you experience intense and lengthly firefights.  This is because of heavy weapon recoil, suppression, and iron sights.  I could go on forever, but that would make this a rubbish review.  I'll finish by mentioning a few more things.  This game has artillery barrages, P-51 mustang strafing runs, carpet bombings, Stuka divebomber er, dives.  You can even see the planes in the air as they rain death upon you.  This game has bayonet charges, weapon meele  functions, pistol whippings, radios and officers, flamethrowers, and much more.  Also, to finish this up, everything, I mean EVERYTHING you see in the Day of Infamy trailers can be done in the game.  I WOULD PAY $60 FOR THIS GAME AND BE HAPPY FOR WHAT I GET.  Cough up the bloody money and play a great game!"

,Not Recommended,447820,26336410,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,ragequitmaster,"Day of Infamy is the ""continuation"" of Day of Defeat (a popular WWII multiplayer game) developed by the creator of Insurgency. The game was originally a mod available for the latter mentioned, and became a full release soon after.My first impressions based on the first few hours are unfortunately mixed. Playerbase is extremely low. I can find a game most of the time in my region but only a few and often no proper pvp server. So, it is not exactly a 24/7 game. People say that with the full release more players will come, and I hope so.The current state of the game is good. There are occasional bugs, like misaligned accessories and a few weird animations but nothing game-breaking. Performance is okay on most of the maps, far better than Insurgency's. Gameplay is solid, a simplified Insurgency basically. There are less weapons and accessories, less options overall. Still, I really like how Infamy plays, it is closer to those multiplayer games which came out a decade ago then those top-tier 'ultra-immersive' casual modern products. As I do not like the mechanics of DoD (no iron sight for example) I am glad that the new game got a more refined system. I can still jump around and climb walls, but it is more restrained than CoD:UO/CoD2 was earlier. Those two are pretty much my favorite multiplayer games because of the freedom in movement. As they are pretty much dead for a while I have been looking for something similar for years now.While the gameplay is really good I just do not have the same fun with Infamy as with Insurgency or Red Orchestra 2. The main reasons are the style and quantity of game modes and maps. I do not like the flow of the matches. It is partly because of the game modes, but levels are also not necessarily well designed. They are big enough, but somehow that might be a problem here. The limitations of the source engine are quite glaring in 2016. The maximum player count is 32 for pvp matches, which is not enough. I rarely have that immersive feel of actual fight between two armies that is normal in RO2 for example. I dare say that matches are often boring. The whole game feels disjointed. Maybe a more traditional game mode like team deathmatch or search & destroy. Right now Infamy has 5 game modes (3 pvp and 2 co-op) which are quite similar. Unfortunately it is hard to see how the developer could fit any other type of game mode into their maps. They are designed in a way to support this checkpoint-like progression with long streets and interconnected buildings. I would like to see smaller, radially placed maps, with more options for close quarter combat. Basically I am talking about Carentan, Burgundy and Neuville-like levels with multiple points for possible engagement.In its current form and playerbase it is really hard to recommend Day of Infamy. It is nowhere near the complexity of Insurgency and I am concerned whether it will reach that height. I still believe however that NWI will step up their game and include more stuff before the final release. I think the amount of stuff on their roadmap is just not enough. This game feels like a side-project. Map creating contest is a great idea, but will there be people creating quality levels for this game if it is not going to be more popular or relevant for long enough? I will update my review from time to time as the game changes which it will hopefully do.Update about map contest: 12 maps are being tested at the moment. As far as I know none of them is completed yet. Based on what I saw there are about 3 or 4 which looks really good, one being particularly promising, called Brest. Brest is pretty much the type of map that I would like to see more of. There are servers for map testing purposes but I often see none of them or only in the US region. Offline testing with bots also works on maps with navmesh placed.Update: There is a problem with artilleries I think. I often die inside buildings even bunkers from one hit. I would say that it is quite overpowered or simply glitchy at the moment. Playerbase is still extremely low. Between 150 and 250 players online constantly. On a usual evening I have 2 servers in coop and about 1 pvp in my region (EU) with at least 50% of the max player count. I rarely find any test servers with people on it.Update 31/03/2017: For now I change my review to negative. I enjoyed Insurgency quite a lot and the early hours of DoI were good but right now something feels way off for me. Bot AI, crashes, changed game modes, achievement reset, and an boring flow overall spoils the game for me. I will wait for a few updates and check the game then write a new review for the final release.04/10/2017: Far beyond release the game did not get traction. Only a few hundred players, few added maps, same old boring game modes. New maps usually have stuttering issues. It is a real shame it came to this.MY OPINION: 7.0/10 (FAIR)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 7/10Gameplay: 7/10Sound: 8/10Replay Value: 6/10"

Things have been more redistributed agmonst classes and balances between the factions (Wehrmacht, Commonwealth and USA), and people are starting to understand the need for officers/radio communications and having actual teamwork in the game.What sucks mostly now is what the devs are doing and the playerbase.What the developers generally do is just port maps from DoD, which have been played time and time again, which really offers nothing new in the way of content. If you're a DoD veteran, you're gonna get bored of the map rotations quite quick. Even newer players do so. The array of maps is so short you could probably play all of them in a matter of 10 hours of gameplay. Even if these maps are ports, they're horribly bland. outside shots are beautifull, having wonderfull scenery, but as soon as you step foot in a building, you get absolutely underwhelmed by the dullness of the interiors. Not to mention, half the time you get stuck on geometry within the interiors or on random little bricks on the ground. Even if they are beautifull, they are chokeholded on the Source engine since they can only have 40 players max, and are stuck to narrow maps, allowing even for officers on the enemy team to carpet bomb your base repeatedly.Then to speak of the playerbase; it's a mixed bag.You have people who A) Know what they are doing and are good players. B) CoD-esqe noobs whom don't exactly know how a more advanced FPS game works in terms of teamplay, or C) Absolute trash players who can't shoot a gun to save their life, and D) ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates and hackers. Especially the hackers. I've noticed on a lot of private servers there's a growing number of hackers that the devs seem to hardly notice.Oh and admins? Hardly any to be seen. Even dedicated clans that say they hack, and never get banned. On the flip side, you'll encounter teammates that will scream into the mics to annoy you, or litterally brag on getting 50-4 because they hack or are Officers that can call down arty on clusters of noobs, or do other stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥to that calibre.So tl;dr: THe devs have made wonderfull advances on gameplay and balance, but have to really learn how to map design and weed out the playerbase of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players.

,Recommended,447820,24596220,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,CruiseCTRL,"What I think about DOIAfter playing for a few hours now, I can safely say that this game is a welcome addition to NWI's roster and a great community-born successor to DoD. The mechanics that are featured are very intriguing and leave up to interpretation how any one person may handle a situation. Overall, I am really happy with my purchase and can't wait to see how they shape the game from here.GameplayThe gameplay featured is one of the most fierce, team defining experiencing I've had. For the majority of my time so far, I played an Officer class. The Officer can call in airstrikes and smoke airstrikes. You, alone, cannot do this. Someone playing support that has a radio equipped must be in your proximity to send out calls to the artillery. If that individual has their baackup shot too much, then his radio is rendered useless. These little things make the game that much more exciting and engaging. The engineer class, anotherr which I played, has access to flamethrowers and RPGs. The flamethrowers in this game are extremely balanced and don't give you the immediate edge unless you are within 10-15 feet. So far, it seems like some maps need to be redone because it's near impossible to attack certain positions and always seems to have people losing on the attack no matter what. This isn't a problem too much as it only happens on two maps I've seen. Other than that, everything is very smooth and makes for a great team building experience.OverallI would rate this game, in the current state, a 9/10. I've had a lot of fun so far and I've only played around 3 hours. If you're looking for a definitive team experience based on DoD and feels like Insurgency, then get this game."

If you don't care or already understand and only want to know how good the game is, skip to the 2nd paragraph. Enjoy:The ""It's early access, of course it has problems!"" argument shouldn't be used to justify this game's problems. Here's why: Being in early access doesn't make the problems stop existing. If a developer wishes to charge the price of a full release for their game, I will treat it as if it's a full release. To reiterate, the quality of a product is not changed by the presence of an arbitrary ""Early Access"" label on its store page. I can't let myself recommend a game which is objectively worse than other products within its price range simply because of thepossibilitythat it could improve later. I'll recommend it when it does improve and has eclipsed its competitors in quality. Until then, I will not recommend bad games, and I will recommend good games- Early Access or not. Quality is quality: A good early access title is better than a bad full release, and a good full release is better than a bad early access title.Crashes at least once an hour at the very minimum. Pitiful hit registration (Most enemies have an area directly under the neck for about 6 to 8 inches down that quite literally won't register being shot) which is so bad that sometimes bullets simply never register as existing, essentially turning about 25% of your bullets into blanks and super unreliable bipod deployment on machine guns make for a game that is fun when it works, but is rarely workable enough to be fun. Similarly to Insurgency, enemy hitboxes will occasionally disappear if an enemy is in a dark area over ~40 meters from you, meaning that there are situations wherein you'll be shooting at a boogieman with a MG42 if you play on the larger maps. It's better than Insurgency in this regard, as enemies don't turn into specters of the night in EVERY interior area,  but it's still definitely a factor.Definitely wait for a sale. I don't regret my purchase, as the content is still updated enough and the playerbase is fairly steady (and the British voice actors are wonderful, think Chivalry-esque), but the neverending stream of bugs and lag is a big caveat if you want a game that will function reliably. I get easily frustrated when it comes to glitches, and my luck is so bad that I run into 3 or 4 big ones a round at a minimum, so I'm going to have to downvote it until either the price is reduced or the bugs are sent to the gulag. A few months ago I would've recommended Verdun over DoI, but that has changed seeing as Verdun has decayed in both quality and playerbase at a striking rate.tl;dr: Decent fun, very glitchy and unstable. If you're frustrated by dying to unavoidable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (like me, thus the downvote), be it invisible enemies with machine guns or glitches, avoid. If you don't mind that, wait for a sale. Only buy at full price if you have absolutely nothing else to do and refuse to play anything other than a first person shooter."

It's literally a reskin of DoD:S with Insurgency mechanics. So they are basically using an old graphics engine to target the dying/dead DoD:S crowd who are moving to other games, anyway, as DoD:S has grown so long in the tooth. Seems like a fool's errand in my opinion. I also see DoI as being considered a middle ground between DoD:S and Red Orchestra 2. However, in trying to compare it to both, one only realizes that it is neither one, which raises the question of: why should I buy it instead of one of those, then? Other than that, the developers have always been super-reactive to what the community wants. And the community is usually very nice and helpful in games, with lots of units to join and be part of."

Bought DoI without a second thought since another FPS from NWI couldn't possibly be bad, right?Well, kinda... I'm going to thumbs-up the game, but I am a little disappointed and I shall explain why.The good points can be summarised to this; it's Insurgency in WW2. This is great. 10/10 for concept/execution.The bad points however...For $20, this is sorely lacking in content. I understand that there will be updates in the future which address this, but I feel like I just spent $20 on a mod. If this was a $5 DLC for Insurgency and I had to buy another DLC to unlock a giant update of maps and weapons in the future for another $15, I'd feel much warmer about it. That said, I'd prefer to pay $20 now than wait a few months and have it all in one block. But, I'm not warm and fuzzy inside about this $20. This game is a quarter of what Insurgency was on release. This isn't ""The most fun you can have for $20."" - it doesn't echo Insurgency's legacy. I don't feel inclined to buy spare copies and hand them to my friends as I did previously with Insurgency. Insurgency was awesome and the pricetag was awesome. This is 1/4 of what Insurgency was on release and it costs more.So, I'm not stumbling over myself for a refund. I trust that in a year's time the community maps incorporated in and developer updates will turn this into another Insurgency. But... I can't help but feel NWI went from being my friend to trying to sell me meteor insurance... It's not the worst $20 ever, but this is a bit of a cash grab for something really unfinished, at least compared to your flagship title. This isn't who I thought you were NWI. :/"

Day of Infamy will ultimately become even more camp oriented as time goes on and people learn all the little cheap spots to ""prone n' peek.""Map selection is sparse, with more or less a half-dozen maps debuting at the time of this writing.  Server selection is also slim, with no more than four or so N.A. based servers having players at any given time.  I've seen player count range from upwards of 900, to 300 or so during the early hours of the morning.While a worthy effort, Day of Infamy is ulimately brought down by the ancient engine on which it's built upon, along with its unwillingness to risk anything new in terms of the tired tropes present in older shooters.Worth $20 only if you absolutely must have something to play for an hour or two at a time right now (or if you want to support the Insurgency devs), this title will be far more appealing and appropriately priced once the 50% or 66% discounts roll around."

For a game with not great graphics it is optimized poorly and uses up a ton of memory. If the bugs were fixed it'd be a thumbs up."
,Not Recommended,447820,31311006,Posted: 22 April,all,MoonKat,"Same Issues as InsurgencyJust like NWI's previous game, Insurgency, Day of Infamy is a half-done shooter. Insurgency has definately come a long way, the price makes me not hammer on it as harshly as you get a lot for the price. Day of Infamy however, lost the chance to be something unforseen and amazing.....Lack of WW2 shooters....You will see time and time again in reviews and the forums is ""the best tactical WW2 shooter"". I'm not going to begin to describe how ""tactical"" is such an over used word [usually used wrongly] but instead I will explain how the lack of WW2 shooters make this the best....and NWI knows it.Since the community, and me for that matter, have been so desperate for a new WW2 shooter a lot of the issues get overlooked or excused. The issues are as follows:-No custom servers. You either got to be a code monkey [and sometimes that doesn't even work] or pay to host your own server. LAN servers are easy enough, but after several updates for some reason the console commands for bots don't work as intended.-No tutorial map or firing range, just videos. A lot of people like to tell me ""offline with bots is your firing range"". My response? It can't be that hard to program a simple firing range so you can test fire weapons at various ranges. Insurgency had a training map, why can't this one?-A bit nit picky but, when you pick up a gernade off the ground your character completely puts his gun away to get it. A simple hand animation would be better than putting your gun on your back.-Balance. It's gotten better and worse at the same time. The commonwealth shotgun is an amazing weapon. I don't want it's firepower nerfed, just its range. I can pull off the longest shots with this thing. Truth be told, every weapon has a little issue. They fix one balance issue, break another.-Limitations of the source engine. Poor lighting, graphical bugs and the fact I can recognize borrowed assets from other source games kill the immersion. This also limits player counts, which means we will never have huge battles, but instead a not-so-amazing version of Day of Defeat.-Your character doesn’t shut up. If you are being stealthy and going behind the enemy. If you see an enemy your guy might go “ENEMY SPOTTED” and guess what? The other team will hear it.-Realistic gun mechanics on small maps. Yeah bolt action rifles are good and all but when 90% of the maps are close quarters if you miss one shot you are done because the other guy probably has a semi, full or a flamethrower.-Unoptimized as crap. This is partly source, partly devs being like “Get a good GPU breh, not our problem”-Small player base. I hate this issue for the sole purpose that the community likes to think it's because gamers are ""wanting too much"". They claim it's just because gamers find 20 bucks too much when the game has more content than -insert triple A game here-....but it doesn't....and that's the worst part.Oh the lack of content is definately the worst part. In one day you could see all this game has to offer. Even Call of Duty wasn’t that bad. NWI has nobody to compete with, so their lack of content doesn't bring much damage to their sales as it would if there was more WW2 shooters. I am inclined to conspire that this is why NWI doesn't try as hard to bring new content....there is no need, for their player base is here and they made their money. Until Call of Duty WWII comes....this is the newest and best WW2 shooter. With the Vietnam mod hitting workshop, I can't help but have flashbacks to the Day of Infamy mod for insurgency....they have moved on, Vietnam is next. Here is some examples of lack of content:-Maps. I hate lack of maps. Every shooter has this issue except a select few. To top of it off, servers have map voting and it's usually the same 3 maps: Crete, Dog Red and Foy. More maps would help this. The reason these 3 are chosen is due to the fact the other maps are kinda one sided. When Insurgency finally got maps, I stopped playing Sinjar so much because their was so many more good options.-Singleplayer. Only offline with bots is singleplayer. I know this is a multiplayer focused shooter, but what happens when the game dies? Oh well right?-Factions. Just Germans, Americans and Commonwealth. A dev once told me it was because the ""Eastern Front is overdone"". I would agree that games WITH ONLY eastern front is overdone. There is tons of games just about the Eastern Front, but you know what would be an amazing game? One with East, Pacific, Europe, Africa, Finland heck maybe even Alt-history? There would be so many more experiences to be had but NO we get to play D-Day 100 times. There is no Greeks, Japanese, French, Finnish, Russian, Chinese, Phillipino, NOTHING.-Day of Infamy title, no Japanese. I find this misleading. Like, FDR was referring to Pearl Harbor in the Day of Infamy speech right? Why name a game about this speech and have no Japanese?The goodJust like Insurgency the fanboys will downvote this no matter what [again if you own the game why are you reading this? Unless you are a dev, you have no buisness here] but I will attempt to do this game some good by pointing out the pros:+WW2 shooter in a world that lacks new WW2 shooters.+Mod support+Achievements can be gained offline with bots+Price is relatively good.+An attempt at realism with gun mechanics and sound+Classes are all specific in their roles I.E. Officer calls in air support from a Radioman's radio+If you look in the right places, this game had good graphicsI am going to not recommend still till more content is added and issues are fixed. Only buy if you need to cure that WW2 kick without going into the past. Be warned, player base is slightly dropping and I'm pretty sure the devs are moving on."

RO series and DoDs are unique and are classic examples of games that have identity.That is where DoI fails miserably.... it is the classic ginger of gaming and has very little in the way of a soul.Starting with the good points:Tactical feel (Commader/Radio) is a bit of a copy/ipdate from RO but does make a good team more visible...adds great mechanic to the game.Flamer Flame animation is world class and havent ever seen better in literally any game ive played or on any platform.Textures/authenticity of uniforms and hands are fantastic as are guns.Animations for reloading are standard but well crafted.Map design has obviously had a lot of thought put into it and I love the narrow streets and every house having a use type feel of the game.Bad Points:Player animations/Interaction with the world are just shocking for a game that has recently been released....... i.e. Proning parallel to a slope is common..... getting stuck on a two inch tall rock or piece of rubble....... wooden running looks more akin to the scene out of forest gump where he has leg straightening supports, straight back no physiological/anatomical look to the run/walk.Interaction with the environment is as simple as crouch jumping through a window no animations for someone to climb through a window and I can literally jump out of any window without fear of death while firing.When you run it doesnt feel like you are running there is no feeling of impetus or bobbing/head movement and I feel like I can shoot fairly accurately while going full pelt....Smoke animation ^^ Its as though its on a timer? one second the place is covered in thick smoke next... boom! its gone.Faces look like something out of 007 on N64... bit pedantic but crazy when they look so crap compared to uniforms.Ballistics...... there are none. Genuinely each gun feels the same.. have shot most and my god does a K98 feel different to a Garand lol.Recoil is laughable..... Spray and pray accurately is the call of the day.... Ive been quite successful with the mg doing just that. No Skill.All in all......... love what theyve tried to do, but anyone who says that its a replacement for DoDs hasnt played DoDs much.... even today I would (if player numbers are still about) rather play that game to this....On the other hand if you are a CS:GO player wanting a change of scenery might be worth a punt :P"

But there's too many issues to recommend this game right now:1. Load times are eternal. You'll be seeing a lot of ""Day of Infamy is not responding"" popups no matter what you do.2. Hit registration barely works at all. It's a LOT worse than Insurgency, CS:S, or any other Source game I've ever played. I don't know how they managed to make it so bad. You'll shoot a Kraut in the face at point-blank range and miss 3/5 shots even if he's not moving. Machineguns and flamethrowers are correspondingly overpowered because they don't suffer as much from the broken shooting mechanics.3. The maps are super, super small. It's really easy for carpet bombing or stuka strikes to wipe out half of your team.4. Most of the maps suffer from major spawncamping problems (how is this still an issue???)It's a pity, because I really like the music and sound direction. The core experience is still really really rough."

It is a nice concept and if it gets to where insurgency is at I will recommend the game. At this point the game is too buggy (Alpha). You will select a class and spawn and at sometimes one of the following will happen:1) Spawn with no model of your gun (fixed by switching weapons and switching back)2) Spawn with the camera being really out of wack ( again fixed by switching weapons)3) Spawn where you can't shoot or aim your weapon( Yet again fixed by switching weapons)4) Spawn with a class either the one you chose but with a different weapon or a completely different class)This doesn't always happen but if it happens once you must reboot the game or it will start happening many times in that session.PROS: Love the realism and if you wear great headphones you will feel like you are in the game and forget about the real world. Audio and visuals are the best thing about the current build. Fix the bugs and you have an amazing game

While I have not played Insurgency or the mod in question, I did research the content available. I wanted to also write a review, but felt the problems would be better off in a listed format over a flowery construction due to the issues and the content.Graphics are the least compelling aspect of this game and has some very minor texture quality. It is running on the Source Engine, but from what I have seen from other games on the engine (even the videos of Insurgency I watched) fells aged. Weapon designs for the most part are basic to the point of looking plastic. This is not so much a negative as a reference for people looking for something more graphical visual.Sound is spot on for weapon fire and voice acting is decent. There is an error with certain weapons that will continue to play their fire sound after death until you respawn and Fire the weapon again.Content is based around six maps with two difficulty settings (no friendly fire and showing kills vs friendly fire and no kill broadcasting). There are over 20 weapons and three factions that include the Commonwealth, US and Germans. Multiple classes are available and include select weapons based on class and faction to varying levels of balance. Artillery is also a feature that requires a Officer to have either a support or engineer with a radio to call down offensive (barrage) and defensive (smokescreen) attacks to help turn the tide of battle.Single player, multiplayer and co-op options are also available with three game types for multiplayer and co-op. Single player is extremely difficult due to design right now and requires a lot of work before it can be reliable. Co-op bolsters Entrenchment (hold points against AI), Patrol (patrols and eliminate enemies at points) and Stronghold (take points against AI). Multiplayer offers Frontline (capture all areas with each side holding two at start), Liberation (capture all areas starting with zero points) and Offensive (Entrenchment with enemy players).Combat is first person and has two failure states: run out of reinforcement waves or the objectives are completed by the opposite side. The UI is very limited by design and just include a magazine count and objective/timer status to retain as much realism as possible. Weapons do not reload automatically and there is no ammo counter for how many rounds you have in the chamber. Once you die, you must wait for a wave to activate in order to respawn. Based on some map design, rounds can be over in less than five minutes or continue on for fifteen. It really depends on how much your team is working together versus the lone wolf mentality that is common on some servers.It is unfortunate that several big issues are pulling down the experience and while it is in alpha, it is still important to take into effect. Hit box detection is a glaring occurrence with the major culprit being the artillery fire. More often than not a shell will kill you even if you are enclosed in a bunker or on the first floor of a two-story house. The penetration is unbelievable at this point, especially when you consider I have not died once to artillery out in the open. Flamethrowers (which recently got adjusted) also have a strange tendency to self-immolate from firing the flamethrower into the open. I know if you fire into a surface it can splash damage you, but it shouldn't be possible to fire into a open space and have it splash back. Weapons also have a range of reliability with many times seeing an entire clip being fired at a close range (or five snipe rounds into the same stationary target) without killing them. I say this understanding my terrible skill.Frame rate issues come and go as well as frequent loading screen freezes and game crashes. It is all probably due to the serious optimization issues this game is suffering from.Is the game fun? Frustratingly so. Will I continue to play it after posting this PSA? Not likely. The game can become increasingly dull over a couple of hours and I have the lack of map variety to blame for that. Insurgency currently has well more than triple the map amount with more weapons for half the price ($20 not on sale). The value for the price is just not worth it right now, especially with something as unreliable as hit box detection aggravating things. I will return in six months to see how well the game has progressed, but until then I suggest sticking to a cheaper alternative.This has been a EAW PSA."

Also, the Source engine does not let the project shine. There is no bullet drop and bullet travel time, which is why the game has no large and open maps. Rifles are relatively rare, because most classes are capable of carrying an SMG, which they do because of the small distances. Long respawn times and a generally unforgiving spawn system, while it brings a unique gameplay type, it makes the game very harsh for new players. Atmosphere and immersion-wise I found it quite rich and engulfing. If you are looking for a ""realistic"" WW2 game, then this will probably let you down, but if you just want a WW2 FPS that will keep you excited for a while, you may like it. Consider that it is on early access, which means there is work in progress."

This is the case when all of my predictions about this game were right.When I asked community ""Whats the difference between Day of Infamy andDay of Defeat\Insurgency"", they satrt explaining  something about atmosphere and historical accuracy, teamplay and so on.Total bull*hit.In fact, this is DoD. They even licensed some maps, brought some Insurgency mechanics... and thats it.Pros:Fancy menuand art design.Rare weapons, such as Fg.42 are here.Different unlockable camosof the famous divisions, according to maps(yes, it is prohibited to reconquer Bastogne in italian front camo, thats great)Cons(Spoiler-everything else):Low-scale battles.It was ok for Insurgency, because it fits modren combat style, CQC, bearded marines and you know, all this stuff. But for me, this 10vs 10 battles in WW2 setting look hilarious, and outdated, remembering DoD in 2008.Boring gameplay. Too fast to feel realism, too slow to be CS-like shooter.Ruined atmosphere. You dont feel WW2 because of previous reasons.France and Italy again. Yeah, damn me, again this villages, CAFE-RESTAURANTE, and fields. Boring as hell.Awful graphics- guys, it is 2017. I think making a game on 2004 year engine is a... scam or misrespect to players.Sound- on the same level. They even did not try, I guess. Placed fart instead of shooting for every gun. Airstrike sound is childish.Poor optimisation! Wow, stop, really? Yeah, squad system is not working properly in menus, long loading screens there, not in game(lol). For 2 hours of gameplay it even crashed once.The thing I can't understand is how this ""masterpiece"" got such a good revievs. Probably from old Day of Defeat fans and nostalgy.Dont believe propaganda - Its not a game about WW2.

The gameplay has the correct mixture, slow enough to be enjoyable but not boring yet fast enough to not be another generic twitch shooter. Some players will rush you but most will take their time to scout out an area and slowly move in and take it over.Due to the low server count I thought I would endure a few round at 250+ ping, unlike some games where you get a noticeable amount of rubber banding this game had none, even other players in the game were moving around smoothly (take note Valve, Counter Strike: Global Offensive still can't get this right).The game modes are pretty much the same as every other FPS game, you have to hold and defend set points on the map while others attack and vice versa.The map design is alright, some maps seem to tunnel off in to rooms, which lead on to more rooms as you look for an exit hoping that there isn't someone waiting around the corner with an SMG.Personally,I will be refunding this game until the playerbase expands in to something more than 2 - 3 full American servers."

It can be very confusing to figure out where the current front line is in a match at any given time. I spent ages pointing my gun from cover in the wrong direction because I couldn't tell from what angle the enemy was coming from. The game gives you little and poor feedback on the Map, the UI or audio ques. This is something red Orchestra 2 and Verdun do really well, changes to icons on the map, audio ques, big text telling you when an enemy has captured a point and you need to fall back before you're mobbed etc etc. If these UI and UX problems are solved I think this will be a fantastic game, but until then I'm getting a refund."

The wall clipping is terrible when you shoot a flamethrower out of the window and you die to your own flamethrower bouncing off of the window.

,Not Recommended,447820,24680791,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,[|||] Magnum Force,"Day of Infamy,One of many WW2 mods that has been put out as a standalone game.The thing is; is it worth all the fuzz about it?Frankly, that's not so easy to answer to be honest.See, we've got very solid WW2 shooters and let's say not so solid ones already. Day of Infamy is one of those that tries to be part of the solid ones, but doesn't really cut it. Not yet that is.The thing is that Day of Infamy seems to be putting most of the effort into gameplay and teamwork than graphics. Which, in my opinion, is a very good thing. especially with most new games nowadays doing just the opposite.So, why is it then that I just think of it as not being on the solid part of WW2 shooters.""What I see is not what I get""I see fairly accurate models of weapons (Not high poly, or high res), I see A.I. that seems to be knowing what to do and I see maps that look interesting. But, all of this is just what I hope to get, but isn't in the package.For instance. The German A.I. shouts ""Rauchgranate"" when they deploy a smoke grenade. *Buzz* Big error on the developers side. It's called ""Nebelkerze"", especially during WW2 and not smokegrenade. A grenade has a totally different meaning in the German language. But, then again, it's an error that could be easily fixed.On the other hand, the German voice(s) sound somehow not German all the way. There's a weird underlying accent that doesn't sound like a native German speaker. It could be a mxing issue, or they just didn't really care to get an adult Native German with military background experience.The MG42 is another thing that is way off the way it should be. There's no barrel swap, no correct ledging and if you really have to, hip firing the MG42 is not shown in the correct way either. Also, the fire rate and the sound of the MG42 are not what they should be. But, again, this could be easily fixed.A thing they do, which I like a lot, however is the fact that friendly A.I. will respond to your ammo request if they can, something which still hasn't been correctly implemented in a game like Red Orchestra or Rising Storm.The maps are also a yes and no situation for me. The reason is that they look nice (Not good,  and not beautiful) and there has been put some thought behind them, which is a good thing. They're fairly balanced and provide each side a good option to stage an attack or hold their ground. But, again, that's not how things are on the real battlefield and which brakes the atmosphere if the entire concept does try to give you this breeze of historical accuracy. The entire game tries its best, but falls flat on its face due to the factor that zero real warfare combat experience shows in any of the design factors.The things which are good however are the general fun factor, sound quality, graphics/texture quality and presentation.Those work really well and do provide all the ingredients for some nice gaming.That is, if you're able to overlook the general bad / cheap looking models that remind you of Enemy Territory a good 15 or so years ago.So, if you're really into ArmA / Iron Front simulation, or something like Red Orchestra / Rising storm then you'll feel kind of left behind with this game and a bit insulted from time to time.Especially when you see the loadouts and the way tactical positions / fortifications have been designed. (Loadouts where not always the same and especially during the end phase of the war; which some maps represent)But, if you (also) like games similar to Call of Duty: World at War, Call of Duty 2 and Wolfenstein Enemy Territory, then this is just as good.Gameplay in solo and Co-Op is fun, anything else is just your standard teenage testosteron marathon. Run and gun, spray and pray.Do I recommend Day of Infamy?No, I don't, because it can't get much more arcade like this and that's something I don't like when it comes down to WW2 shooters.So, for now it's a thumbs down, but if they somehow decide to make it more simulation like; they'll get a thumbs up.The bad thing however, is the fact that Insurgency itself started out as a mod and turned standalone a couple of years later, but still was / is as kiddie as it was in the beginning. The same goes for Day of Infamy if they don't live up to their store page description of being ""realistic"".All in all, Day of infamy is a game that could deliver if the team behind it where more grownup / mature in their execution. Something that reflects in this game. The game looks and feels unfinished, even rushed at moments, feels like a quick cash grab and is aimed towards an inmature audience.When it comes down to the workshop items you see how far it reflects. The items to obtian from the workshop are a many, but all of sub standard quality, although most things are better than the actual content provided by the game."

Even where the gameplay kind of redeems this (kind of?) it's still not as good as Insurgency. Feels like a Day of Defeat rip off, yet done worse and with last decade's graphics. The Game Engine also introduces stuttering into the mix. And this is without the random crashes, and long loading times. This game feels like 2007 all over again, not 2017.All the good content in the game like weapons and skins, are behind unlocks and paywalls. Maps felt generic and unbalanced. Small playerbase, though not as small as some newer games. Day of Defeat Source still has many more players than this surprisingly.In all honesty there are better shooters out there that does the same thing as this game but better. There's a reason why this is on sale for 50% off. Don't bother with this because you will likely end up disappointed like me."

When they made the test maps for this game in Insurgancy  I played them more so than the modern counter part.So I finally got this game and it is an unplayable laggy mess.For starters the load time took more than five minutes to load no matter how good my ping was.   Then when it finally loads up and I get to choose the class there is a long slow waiting period between each selection I make.   But when I finally get to play the game it gets really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The frame rate drops to an abismal rate when ever I pan the FP camera.  Then when I move it skips all over the place.  I was playing a server where I had a ping of 90. This shouldn't happen!This game is not technical challenge to my machiene or a strain to my internet connection.  There are no excuses for this kind of performance when so many other players are able to have great performance with this game on so-so computers.I am uninstalling this game from my machine until release date occurs.  Maybe by then all of this♥♥♥♥♥♥will be fixed.  But the state of this game now I would deem it unplayable.  I am very disappointed.

It's a poorly executed WWII port of Insurgency, which is actually a quite enjoyable game, so it's odd that it worked out so poorly.Guns are clunky, handling is poor, and shooting is less science and more art. Damage is equal across the board, meaning a little 9mm or .45 hits just as hard as a 7.92mm or .308, same goes for penetration power. SMG's are unrealistically powerful at all ranges, which is hilarious in a game going for ""realism"". Movement is slow and you can't vault cover, making navigation a chore, which is bad because the maps are decently large.Worst nail in the coffin for me was the absolutley garbage implementation of flamethrowers. Their ranges are anemic (10-15m as compared to IRL 30-40m ranges), their damage is garbage (People can still function like normal while being doused in liquid fire), and the splash/cone effect is nonexistent (Flamethrowers are infamous for their ability to fire around corners, over cover, and generally flood areas outside the main fuel stream with flames). Rising Storm/RS2 have some of the best flamethrower representations I've seen in a game, these pale in comparison. If you fire a flamthrower in to a room and hit the roof in RS/RS2, the stream hits the surface, diffuses, and causes the room to erupt in flames... You know, like a real flamethrower. In here, you hit a wall and you're lucky if you could ignite a pile of gasoline soaked paper an inch away.And yes, I am EXTREMELY salty about the garbage flamethrowers."

With the WW2 weapons and thier terrible iron sights sighting and killing your target at range, especially the germans with their black uniforms, is very difficult.  However the bots are just as accurate as they were in Insurgency, making things almost impossible on a wide open map.-There's a cool new artillery feature, but you need both an officer and a player willing ot give up some supply for a radio, good luck getting that to happen in a pub.  Also the bots can call arty in on you.-For some reason you now have AI teamates during co-op missions, which muddles the field and makes thigns feel less in control-Checkpoint, the most popular coop mode from Insurgency is gone, and the new Stronghold mode sounds like a good idea on paper, but fails in practice.  You have 2 points to choose between capturing, a great way to split up pubs.-The map designs leave a lot to be desired, out of all them I played only one had the multiple tight corners and street vs indoor combat you had in Insurgency.-There's one rainy forest map where it's so dark the ground is almost black, good luck finding krauts when they blend in almost perfectlyI'm not complaining about a challenging game, I like challegneing games and that's what's had me playing Insurgency's excellent co-op for >250 hours.

Most players will not not be using bolt action rifles as the maps are close quarters AND all player run speeds are ridiculously fast. Even Heavy Armor units and flamethrowers can outsprint a  55 yd 2016 Olympic Gold Medalist.Currently, this game is nothing more than a glorified Day of Defeat, with the odd claim that it's ""realistic"" and ""requires great teamwork"".   Neither are true. It's an arcade run and gun shooter with high recoil on the weapons.Occasionally, a squad lead will call in artillery through the radio of another teamate which will be blocked by the 80% indoors parts of the map. Hardly ""great teamwork"" worthy. Especially with all pubbies.Overall, stick to RO2/RS and wait for RS2 if you want a more tactical, realistic shooter.If you enjoy twitch shooters and want one with high recoil on your weapons, give it a shot then."

,Not Recommended,447820,33874316,Posted: 28 July,all,Shark Bait,"Purchased this game because I liked the immersive realism of Insurgency.Not much to like about this game. It's a Day of Defeat clone with Insurgency style weapons but isn't fun like Insurg.From what I've played so far (Coop) there's not that many players. The servers add ""Bots"" to your team, as well as the enemy team to increase the count.- The gameplay is counter-intuitive.- Spawn deaths.- Most of my early deaths happened just as I spawned in from explosions, bots shooting me through a small hole in a wall from half the map away or other stupid reasons  (and then I had to wait ages to spawn again to play)- Crazy lag.- On numerous occasions the game would lag out and take about 3-4 minutes to recover. Other players noticed and many would time-out.- No training / tutorial mission.- It is incredibly infuriating and frustrating, especially early on when you don't know how to do basic things. You'd think they'd have added a training mode or something.. but nope. If the game was a standard FPShooter then I'd let it pass.. but it's not.- Fanbois.- The player community are pretty stuck-up from what I could see. They consider it a game for ""big boys"" and basically told me to f-off whenever I pointed out how not-fun insta-dying at spawn is. It's ""realistic"" they say, like ordering a bombing run and the bombers appear overhead in 10 seconds. ""Realistic"" they say.- DLC is waste of money.- There are unlockables apparently but they require grinding. I see no difference between the classes that can be purchased, except for visual appearance.- Can't get basic equipment.- Most of the time you can't play a round with a pistol because you don't have enough points for a main gun and a secondary weapon. You need spend your points on things like ""slings"" for your gun. I kid you not.- Unimpressive / outdated architecture / gfx.- The levels didn't look very impressive. Small, limited areas. Think Insurgency with a lot --a lot-- more ways to move around. (Essentially a maze of buildings that have hallways that lead into other buildings. I mean.. how many buildings have you ever been in where they have a hallway leading into the neighbours house? I've never seen it before.. but it's ""Realistic"" apparently.)- Bad AI- These extra routes makes the world a bit more open, you're less likely to find yourself stuck in an area.. except what happens is that you end up running into enemies every time you turn a corner. It makes it pretty chaotic, one German soldier here.. another in another building over there.. Perhaps this is on purpose.. but it just makes it feel as though the enemy are just randomly moving about and not actually defending anything. (And adds to the annoyance and frustration when they headshot you in 2 milliseconds as you turn a corner.)There's a lot more I'm disappointed with in this game. Mostly though along with the sub-standard gameplay, the annoyance factor and the Fanbois have me wishing I had the money go towards a AAA game.Absolutelynotrecommended........░░░░░░░░.............░░░░░░....░████████░░..░░██████░..░███████████░█████████░███████░░░███░█████████░████░░░███░░░█░███░░░░█░███░░████████░░░█░░████░░████████████████░████████░░░███████████░░░░░░█████░░░░██░███████░░░░░███░░░░██░░██░░██░█████░░░██████████░████████░░░█████████░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░░░░░░████░░░░░██░░░░███░░░██░░░███░████░█████░░█░░░██░██░░░█░███░█████░███░░░░█░░░░███░░█░░░░░░█████░░░░░░░░░███░░░░░░░░███░████████░█████░████████████░████████████░░████░██████░░██████████░░███████░░░░░░░████████░░██████████░█████░███████████████████████████░███████████████████████████░████░░░░░░░░░██████████████░░███░▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▒▒░██░▒▒░░░░░░░▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒░██░▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░███░░░░░░░░▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒░███████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░████████████████████████░██████████████████████░░████████████████████░░███████████████████░░░███████████████░░▒▒░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▒▒░▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒░Lord Pepe approves this message"

At first i got what I expected, brutal bayonet and buttstroke combat, sense of impending doom as you hear the rotors of bomber planes followed by the whistle of bombs cutting through the air and about to land next to you, the roaring of at least 100 men charging with the intent to kill you and the inhumane use of flamethrowers.keep in mind I have almost 2 days worth of gameplay put into this game but it just feels like it was a poor transition from insurgency to DoI. Most notably for me was the map ""Dog Red"" which is what i think is supposed to be D-Day in this game. It seems silly to send a small squad of infantry to storm the beach and fight the other small squad of defending germans. The game advice given to you during loading screen will tell you to charge in and just keep rushing. The way the game actually plays is counterintuitive to this advice though. Which leaves supply drops (health, ammo and change loadout) closer to you your own capure points. but once you've gone into the enemy's side of the map you will have to run back to the start of the map, die, respawn with full loadout (and hopefully not have to wait too long) and god forbid the you have a cheese commander on your team that only calls in artillery!I'd bet the next game made will be based on the Vietnam war with the way they added body dismemberment to the game.

However as a player who really liked old MoH games, and wished that DoI would surpass those old games in their  category;+ by being better looking,+ having better combat system+ having absolutely cool looking/feeling gun recoil and gun hipfire system, compared to some older/other ww2 shooters i have played previously.+ Gun sounds and  explosion sounds/visuals actually gave me that adrealine rush feeling what i havent felt in couple of years while playing ww2 shooter.However... saying all this stuff might makes you wonder why i dont recommend this game at its current stage really not to anyone, reasons for that can be found quite literally after you enter the first match which is an shame really. So i listed down below all the reasons what i personally feel like what could easily cut this game's momentum so to say to raise to the current top of the ww2 shooters on the market.- First and the biggest reason  what i feel like made me thought about un-installing this game would the be fact that the game currently does not have any bigger games modes than 15 vs 15 maps, on an small scaled maps made for games such as CoD or CS-GO, this quite annyoingly scales the games potential to be WORLD WAR 2 shooter game, where one would expect full scale war hence the name, but in reality its nothing more than small skirmish fights only. But then again if that were to be possible you would need vehicles also on the game which of course never where on this one, but i also didnt expect to see them here.Second and if not as big reason for me as the first one ,then easily behind it.-The map design. Never have i ever been so dissapointed to an FPS- game having so BADLY made maps that makes me wonder why they even bothered to release this game on its own stand alone title to the market... The maps are made so badly that sometimes my soldier gets STUCK on certain doors or corners in certain rooms on certain maps, which of course makes me feel like that my soldier would not be so ''fit for duty''. This purely annoyed me, when i needed to get away from the enemy or get to the cap point fast, sometimes i could not. Thanks to this ''thing''  they put to the game.And im not finished there on maps, the next thing about map design on this game, is nothing more basic about them than how they are made for certain game modes... this was really annyoing. Realising that on some maps, enemies/your own team could  EASILY flank the opposing team by given spawn points, which of course made your team or the opposing team camp all the time on certain chokepoints. Since your or the enemy team had next to little chances to get to the objective by poorly made basic thing on every FPS game feature on the game...Oh and did i mention that if by any chance you happen to find yourself on enemy spawn point, just becouse you dont want to cross open area covered by enemy sniper/s  to get to the cap point. You cant shoot anyone there and they can shoot you? Yeah that one too.Well these are my top 2 reason why i didn't like this game, but i also dont want bother writing another wall of text so i just put down some honorably mentions;- There is no matchmaker on the game other than you manually choose an game on the server list which for EU player such as myself are filled by US servers, (and by filled i mean 5 :D )  so the options for me are either wait for those 2 servers what have EU ping have 31 players out of 32, so that i can join either one or join US server what has atleast 150 ping for me, if im lucky its 130.- You have unlimited sprint. Personally i dislike this option for ww2 shooter, it just does not feel right to sprint like captain america.- Quite small player base, i only saw at max 7 servers full on pvp 15 vs 15. Would have expected more on such game that looks so good on screenshots, and youtube gameplay videos... but i guess.- For some reason my soldier wants to speak to the radio or speak to himself like an crazy person on enemy lines, which makes it unique feature on the game but... i didnt like it too much.Well, im sure there are many other things good and bad what separates this game from other ww2 shooters at the moment, but as it so happens when you experience the hell what those baddies on ww2 deserved you really dont want to stay there anymore than 3.9 hours. At least i didn't.That being said i must admit that i may have shown too much  bad light on some features on this game, but in the end its nothing else than opinion from quite salt filled gamer, what isn't too rare to find thesedays. So lastly would i recommend this game to anyone? Sure. If by any chance you like close combat / CS, CoD game maps where the gun play good and fast as they come. Did i mention good looking and feeling? That too.Have a nice day, and ty for reading / giving part of your time for such review as this one! :)"

A game needs to be at least 7/10 for me to recommend.A few things I don't like are- The menu and UI is really hard to read and doesn't pop out so you end up looking around for what you need. That should be a easy fix I don't know why it seems so messy and unintuitive.- Low player population. Only like 300 people play...- Something about the player movement is terrible. It feels like your walking though 3 feet of water, constantly bump into doorways and other objects, it just feels sluggish. One way to describe it is how you move on Dayz. Some might say its ""realistic"" but it's not, a fit soldier shouldnt move like a uncoordinated morbidly obese person.- Too many maps based out of italy. a classic wwii shooter should be france, germany, and eastern europe.A few things I like are- The ""dismemberment"" update is really cool. More gore and blood is always nice in a shooter video game- The gun sounds are good, so are the player voice commands.- It runs great with full settings, even on a not so great computer- The dev team seems to be really interactive and involved in the game.Like I said, a lot of people will like this game, but for me I just can't recommend it based off the cons I listed."

76561198014050970,Not Recommended,447820,30772903,Posted: 27 March,all,Taco,"2017-07-22 EDIT: 4 months later the game got more guns & more buggs. They did seem to have fixed the invisible players bugg, so props for that one.TL;DR: Day of Infamy is poorly designed & buggy.I hate to say this, as I really liked Day of Defeat, but this clearly is not Day of Defeat. It's a frankenstein monster with pieces cobbled together from both Day of Defeat & Red Orchestra 2.Run & gun oriented rulesets don't play well with tactical mechanics. The worst part is the randomness coupled with long ""respawn timers"". Getting panzerfausted when capturing a small objective zone inside a building from accross half the map is not fun, but things like that happen frequently. The game features teamkilling AI, very difficult to avoid airstrikes (in case of strafe-run it shoots before you hear it) coupled with low playercounts per server, making each random kill hurt the entire team effort tremendously.It's not just that it meshes things that don't go together well, but Day of Infamy also have a lot of unique problems. There's still a fair amount of bugs, mostly visual, like people becoming invisible. The game stutters every single time a new sound plays unless you set the ""cl_forcepreload 1"" launch option. Half of the classes don't make any sense, with some objectively superior to others. The weapon sway is ridiculusly high, I've never seen such extreme weapon sway in any other game. The game is so bad at teaching new players how to play that most noobs are not just utterly useless, but sometimes even detrimental to the team, doing things like exploding & smoking teammates. I understand why they wanted to add the skins system, but the result of it is that khaki germans get teamkilled 50 times more than usual. The weapon loadout system is broken, as the same equipment have different costs for different classes, as well as you can't carry more than 1 type of engineer-only explosive, despite having 2 explosive slots, stunting player-choice, which is counter-productive.Day of Infamy have the same hip-fire system Red Orchestra 2 have, except it's boundaries have been increased dramatically, making hip-fire a stupid decision unless the enemy covers 80% of your screen (even with automatics).The damage system is 90s standard. You get hit, you lose health, until health reaches zero in which point you die. Red Orchestra 2 had a far different system designed with it's other mechanics in mind, which helped foster tactical game-play & made melee an actual option. Melee in Day of Infamy is like in Counter-Strike, except it's 2 hits to kill, but you can unload a pistol magazine into someone before they can hit you again. As a result, melee is never used unless all your weapons are out of ammo, even if the enemy is so close to you they block your movement.I love the flamethrowers in this game, they act like real ones, spewing out a cloud of fire at a short distance, not igniting anything else but people. They're used to spear-head attacks in close-quarters, often indoors, just like in WW2. They're also the only weapons you can effectively counter automatics with, as bolt-action is pretty bad all-around due to small maps & extreme weapon sway. There is also the case of the Einstoss, unless you know exactly where to aim it'll either do nothing or lit you on fire, I'd recommend all noobs to try it out.As I mentioned with at the segment with the flamethrowers, automatic weapons trump everything. Bren, BAR & STG are pretty much the best weapons in the game. They hit hard, they're accurate, fire rapidly & have large magazines. All SMGs & flamethrowers (minus Einstoss) come second, due to their inaccuracy. The problem here is that automatics are easy to get your hands on, so the majority of players choose them, as not doing so is in most circumstances an objectively bad dicision. In Day of Defeat the bolt-action rifles used to be among the best weapons if you were skilled enough, weapon sway & the hip-fire system make them very bad in majority of circumstance in Day of Infamy.For some reason if you hit fuel-dumps with rockets their explosive radius is larger, making it nearly impossible to destroy fuel-dumps with rockets without sacrificing half your team.All of the official co-op servers hosted by NWI are ""campaign"" servers. Campaign servers used to play a faction's missions in order, but now all it does is force you to play a specific faction. I assume this contributes a fair bit to poor player-retention between rounds, as there's no reason to stick to the server & if you want to play as a nother faction you must change server.There is fun to be had in this game, like when you get in a good team whom use teamwork, but it's flaws are so bad I would not recommend it to most people.If they had an actual creative vision with this game, it could've been amazing. Instead they seem to have just used Day of Defeat as a base concept & added mechanics they liked from Red Orchestra 2 assuming it would work. I would only recommend this game to people with a huge amount of patience & free time, whom are willing to put up with poor design decisions & a lot of waiting."

What I got was quite different. I never played the mod so I can't compare it just so you all know. DOI is a game set in the world war 2 era, that feels much more like an arcade game than a ""tactical shooter."" Maybe it's just my luck, but in every game I've played nobody uses tactics, it's run and gun and try to overwhealm the defending team to take an objective. Insurgency feels a lot slower and more tactical and precise. This game is more of a cluster of people running around, shooting like mad and overwhealming the defenders. From the reviews I assume this is like Day of Defeat with better graphics. Not to mention it didn't run very well until I put everything on low and threw in some startup commands.Pros:Decent GraphicsClasses are actually very nice, (Special classes ex. Flamethrower, communications)Decent sized mapsEasy controlsFair amount of weaponsCons:Not a realistic or tactical gameDoesn't run great until you tweak everythingNo teamowrkRun N' GunThe game is dead, 300 people is the most I've seen playRepetitive gameplayI really can't recommend this if you want a tactical game, if you like games like CoD then go ahead, this will be great.

Spotty controls (specifically the way that you aim some weapons, which really becomes a problem with weapons like the Karbiner where you fire one shot and have to hope that your gun hasn't hit that sweet spot where the reticle jumps around), airstrikes that will kill you through walls, very small player base compared to insurgency, even many of the maps have mediocre designs. Most maps in insurgency were relatively linear, but this games maps seem to be more open, meaning you'll be getting hit from behind far more. Even methods like supression are less effective considering the majority of the weapons you'll be using are bolt action rifles with very slow reload times."

This developer can not for the life of them make realistic AI, only perfect programs. That is not good at all because it takes away from what the games are meant to feel like.There should honestly be no singleplayer mode at all and no usage of bots at all. I would rather have multiplayer only than an insultingly garbage single player. I mean all these games are purely meant for multiplayer anyway and thats why  the singleplayer is tacked on.With multiplayer only, there will be more players in the online mode and there won't be any trashy single player to bring it down.This honestly is a great game and there can be some goofy moments too.

It has a variety of characters to pick from, each with their own role and playstyle. The game is also balanced. No weapons or loadout are better than each other and gives out the playstyle you want to play. But in my opnion, the game also has its bad points. First, there is almost no match making where the teams can be unbalanced in skill. This is partcially due to the lack of people playing the game. And because of this, most of the people of this game are looking for a realistic game are already very good at fps's, making it harder for new gamers to catch up. Second, it is a very frustrating game. If you die in the game, it ussually takes around a minute to respawn. This leaves you feeling hopeless because you can't do anything. The spawning waves is a good idea, but I think it may be too long of a wait time. Third, the maps are confusing. Trying to get around the map is extremely annoying. For instance, in Comacchio, there are so many buildings and trying go around or through them is complicated. This is due to the fact that you can't go straight into the point because you would get riddled with bullets, which is a good feature about the game. It takes a long time to traverse the map and can also be frustrating. This is only my opinion about the game, please do not take it personally."

The game feels very shoddy though, even with a good ping and high frame rates the game frequently stuttered and lagged. My frames were wildly fluctuating 50-80 FPS throughout the round. Textures are missing throughout the maps, hitboxes are goofy as hell.Weapons feel bad as well, and the semi auto weapons are ridiculous. I was able to hipfire a full magazine/clip/cylinder in  a second and half an incredibly tight grouping. Semi auto rifles are essentially fully automatic given the rate you can fire them.

,Recommended,447820,27762957,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,MissMajorMudkip,"So I made a Review back in November 2016, and for sure the game was barren a bit before but had an intresting idea; now in it's near final stages of main development for release it's probably one of the best World War II games out there as an FPS.I'm gonna be bringing up the points I made in my last review about Day of Infamy starting with the main gameplay mechanics.Simple stuff, you got a gun, you shoot the Allies or Axis. Easy right?Well, here you're in the grand tour of hell that makes history from being on Omaha Beach (Dog Red) or the main battlements ontop of Germany, and there are more places sure enough. You're a role that makes your team most viable to defeat the opposing side with force, using all the training you probably got before to do the one thing war offers, killing.But as gruesome as that may sounds, your soldier you play as has feelings too, senses the dead bodies of friends he once knew with sorrow and screams like a madman when he is shooting so many enemies. Is a rookie or sometimes a veteran who try pairing together to learn from what they've been drafted into. Day of Infamy serves that purpose by having multiple roles that specialize in destroying mankind.Automatic weaponry, semi-automatic weaponry, bolt-action rifles, pistols, and special equipment that can be used alongside an officer that can call in faction based fire support.The Americans get the basic ""Tom"" howitzer artillery and P-51 strafes. (Take note that all factions have Supply Drops, Smoke Barrages, and Carpet Bombers.)The Commonwealth (Including pretty much the British, Canadians, etc.) with howitzer artillery, Phospherous Barrages, and Typhoon Rocket Strike.The Axis (Germans) get the Panzerwerfer 42 Artillery Barrage and Stuka Dive Bomber.And as crazy how much this all sounds, the audio plays well with all these Officer support strikes including supression, gunfire, and the bits of music the game offers outside of battle.Overall, the game is better than what I actually inticipated in my last review and I am astonished at how World War II games are finally making a comeback in the genre. Definently pick it up today or even yet just buy it in a sale for true value."

What this game does is take the knowledge and experience, as well as some aspects of Insurgency, and utilise it in the WW2 setting.There is still the very objective based team matches, where each side has appropriate weapons and roles to their faction. Whilst its predecessor focused more on small scale urban skirmishes, this game has an emphasis on somewhat larger ground battles. Not much larger than Insurgency, but the maps often are much more open and since only four players on each team can even have optical attachments on their weapons it is not much of a problem.TL;DR - It's a fun game, if you liked Insurgency and if you are interested in the WW2 setting check out this game, it has some new and cool mechanics."

It strikes a fine balance between simulation and arcade games. The level of tension and lethality is palpable in each game, yet the pace of combat doesn't suffer for it, moving along briskly. Besides the radio and fire support mechanics, the game is easily accessible, while requiring a level of thoughtfullness. There is a level of focus I enjoy, in terms of the scope of the game, where the spotlight is on infantry fire-fights, and the attention on that core concept doesn't sprawl away or lose focus.There are many rough edges, and not alot of content. However, the bedrock that the developers have built the game on is solid. As a result, even though its very early in its growth towards a mature full fledged release, most problems need only nudges and prods in the right direction. There are very few of what I consider fundamental issues with the game.As a result, the shooting feels satisfying, the firearms have character, the elements to encourage team play are being chiseled into being. There is a unique rush to using each of the weapons, and a warm fuzzy feeling of fulfillment working together with a well-oiled team. Really the only principal mechanic that could use more work is movement, which feels slightly floatly and disconnected, something I associate with the source engine in general. Another, which I feel is being well addressed is the fire-support and radio mechanics.As an early access game, I think the developers have found a good balance between the frequency and girth of each update. I'm most impressed by how steadily the game has been balanced over time. I do have reservations about the quantity of the maps, but I think as the basic gameplay is polished, the rate that maps are made will increase. The developers do listen, intently, and feel quite active in their work, especially given their size.Is the game fun enough to warrant $20, as it is at the time of this writing? (11/27/2016) The short answer is yes.There is still alot of room for growth and as befitting it current early access state, needs lots of work. I wouldn't reccomend it if you're looking for a fully polished experience, but Day of Infamy is a real diamond in the rough, with very good polishers and cutters at the helm."

If you love WW2, and you love shooters, then do yourself a favor and pick this up. Though the graphics aren't cutting edge, it still his some quite gorgeous visuals. It`s quite visually appealing, and the maps truly put you in a WW2 atmosphere. The gameplay is comparable to Insurgency (as this did start off as an Insurgency mod), and you`ll find yourself using your team quite a lot. The gunplay is very fun and realistic, and the animations are quite nice as well. From what I`ve noticed so far, the dev team is active, and I can`t wait to see what they have in store for this game. Another thing to note is that this gmae supports workshop modding, which is always a plus. I'm a modder and mod user myself, and I love to see games impliment mods, as sometimes they offer things the devs can't or won't put in to the game. I can confidentially say I think this will be one of the few games that will make it out of early access one day.Pros & ConsPros:- Fun gameplay- Great animatinos/gunplay- Good maps- Growing modding community- Realistic and Team Based---Cons:- Though well made, the maps are limited atm- Limited customization- Limited game modesAll in all, this is a great game and I highly suggest you pick it up. Also, if the devs see this, some suggestions I have. More weapon customization, a few more game modes (Maybe convoy assault, bomb assault, hostage rescue missions, just some ideas) and more maps. Keep up the great work!EDIT: Post Dismemberment Update.This game just continues to improve. The devs keep impressing me more and more with every update. They're thinking of ways to make the game better that not even me as a game user would think of. Keep up the great work guys!Storytime: I'm going to post this here, just to show the cool little scenarios that can come out of this game.""Fire""fight: I was playing as the nazis on Salerno. I was a rifleman. I was holding the line at the water fountain, when I decided to try and flank the US. I ran into a bulding on my left, and pulled out my luger. As I snuck into the next room, I seen a US flametrooper standing there. Just as he turned around, I fired. He was mere feet in front of me, and his fuel tank erupted. He was engulfed in flames, and I was right there with him. I caught fire, and ran, but I didn't make it. I stumbled at the feet of my a teamate who had just entered the room. I died in flames, screaming, because of what I thought was a quick kill."

Though in short. The game has just improved, and has more content in it and updated visuals, and improved gameplay (mainly consists of changes maps).But my general opinion still stands. Its a great ♥♥♥♥ing game through and through.)I dont know, its a great ♥♥♥♥ing game. The  best thing you could do is to buy it, since the only real aspect thats lacking right now is the fairly small community (though its not hard to find a server). Though, dont go in expecting a experince like cod two or medal of honor. This is very much if DoD and Insurgency would have a child togheter. Also, it has dismemberment, which makes the already terrifying artillary, carpet bombings, strafes, and grenades, and all that, so much more terrifiying as you see your friend go flying as blood sprays everywhere, and their arms and feet fly through the air decorating the ground.It has enough content for now, for you to be able to spend, well atleast 70 hours. At least. It has a intresting ranking system, where you can actually see everyones rank on their uniforms. And, dude. Just as insurgency, this game can be modded, so you can download your own sights, your own weapon modules, characther models, music, voicelines (the stormtropper scream being my favorite, as you kill your enemies.)It all around a great game. If you want a immersive ww2 experince, this is certanly the game for you.Also, if you are coming in to this expecting DoD:S. But updated grafics, then you may be in for a bumby ride. Because the only real similarity between these two games gameplay wise. is probably just that both are focused on team play, and have short time-to-kill. But otherwise. They are completly mechanically different. Since day of infamy is much more to the milsim side of things. Than to the more arcadey side of things that DoD:S is a part of."

Insurgency has more servers and more players but it all depends on what you want. Modern or World war 2. Insurgency is mordern and Day of Infamy is world war 2. This game is early access and the devs I would say are an indie company. Their games need work with movement and the sounds and graphics. But overall this game is fun to play. Guns are accruate from what I can tell. Character Model skins for the Germans, Americans and British seem accurate as well. No this game isnt some crazy battlefield/call of duty copy cat. It is just a basic aim shoot and take cover. You die in 1 or 2 bullets you run out of ammo. And you have very limited customization. Its world war 2. I give it a 7/10 It needs lots and lots of work but remember these guys dont have EA money and can't just pop out a game in a month and be like IT LOOKS LIKE WITCHER 3 BUT WITH GUNS. Give it a chance and trust me you will enjoy this."

It's gives the perfect balance of tactical and fast-paced gameplay, with weapons that feel heavy and powerful, with bullets that hurt like ♥♥♥♥ when they hit you.  It makes team coordination so vitally important that you get excited to play a support role, knowing that assists contribute just as much to a victory as kills or caps.So, if you're down to play a game that requires both reflexes and intelligence, communication and intuition, patience and heroics, then buy this damn thing and join my squad."

I shifted from enjoying just the mechanics of the game (like most FPSs) to something deeper...The biggest reason to buy this game in my opinion is it's emphasis on the sheer hell that war is, even in a game. This game makes a competiton of the most terrifying tools of mankind and accurately reflects the pain they can cause. Every bullet carries with it a chance of dying, explosions are beyond powerful, tearing limbs off of soilders like a knife and wax paper. Chaos looms around every decision as you and your team frantically attempt to rout the enemy. And that's not even the best part...The sound of it all. From the screams of cooking men to the hard knock of a bullet crushing the side of a skull. Air support and bombardments silences men before they can even cry for help and deafen you with pillars of seemingly audible smoke. You will hear war, and I promise this game is the closest you can get to 1942, with the real brave and for some, the real unfortunate.P.S. As you die, the game keeps the camera locked to your first person view, and as long as you don't immediately skip-to-spawn, you (depending on your death) see your last moments. Sometimes you peacefully lay in a field, fading to black slowly. Sometimes the darkness is sudden, Sometimes you just  scream and twist in pain.its a lot to think about, considering some young men did the same thing and not behind a  computer screen."
,Recommended,447820,30679483,Posted: 22 March,all,GorgonPornstar,"Originally, I was very hesitant to buy this game for being so similar to Insurgency. I always thought ""Why pay for a game I already own if it's just skins and ambience?"" Eventually I ponied up the dough and got DoI. I have to say that I was thoroughly and pleasantly surprised. It's similar enough to Insurgency that veterans of it, like myself, can hop right in with little adjustment. However, DoI is different and unique enough to stand on its own two legs. Despite seeming slower paced with ancient weapons and gear, it is far more intense and visceral than its predecessor. Insurgency felt very dry with its constant 'advance under smoke' tactics. With DoI, that smoke just got targeted for a Stuka dive bomber while you're charging up the beaches of Normandy under withering machine gun fire. This game is just great, plays well, with solid co-op action in or out of the actual co-op game modes."
,Recommended,447820,30679514,Posted: 22 March,all,Boogieman,"Day of Infamy is a very well polished team based FPS. The mechanics are solid and skill is rewarded. The only problem I have with the game is that the games don't feel like they carry any impact. They're typically quick matches and the servers I've played on always repeat (back to back) the exact same game mode, map, team composition twice for every map. Not sure if that is the default server config, but they should at least swap the players to the opposite teams or something.It is a worthy successor to Day of Defeat, but inherits the same properties that ultimately made Day of Defeat relatively niche."

Day of Infamy brings back that feel and fun in a newer package with new features.  Co-op mode was a great surprise to me, offering great challenge and fun while offering different co-op modes.  I can think of many so called triple A games that didn't even offer that.  The balance between fast pace and tactics feels good in this game already.  There are some issues in hit box and map movement points but I have no doubt these will continue to be refined.  Graphics are solid  but this is the valve engine so do not expect the latest technology.  The audio is solid and the game has an overall appropriate gritty feel.  I'm having alot of fun right of the bat with this title and very impressed on the various game modes already offered (multiplayer, numerous co-op and singleplayer modes) at such a great price point.

It's not surprising considering it comes from the Dev's behind Insurgency and I have a stupid amount of hours on that game. Currently, I can't really pick any faults apart from the occasional snapping the AI does in the Co-op mode, the map selection is very small but that's understandable. The map Dog Red is the classic Normandy Invasion and probably one of my favourites, navigating your way off the beach is hell from all the MG42 and 38 fire.Overall, lot's of promise. Some decent content here and with some new coming soon. It's worth a buy, especially if you're an insurgency fan or a WWII fan."

I was a huge fan of Insurgency, due to the realism (of damage and weapon functionality), the great cover system, pretty solid graphics, weapon customization, an amazing cover system, and a huge emphasis on the importance of teamwork. This game is basically all of those great things about Insurgency but applied to some of the most iconic, and also regular, battle scenarios of World War 2.As a history major who is literally obsessed with WWII, this game is perfect for me. I enjoy the realism and the maps (whether its charging the beaches of normandy, crossing the snow-covered fields of Bastogne, or just fighting house-to-house through a European (French) town), and this game delivers at all times. The game takes time to get used to, and you learn quickly that you cannot play like an idiot. You have to work with your team, and you need to play the objective.10/10 for me, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for much more depth in a FPS than a game like CS or the absurd and stupid fast-pace types of combat in games like COD, etc. One or two shots and your dead. Always take cover, always throw smokes, always play the objective.By the way, the price is amazing. No better game for this price."

Also, please, please add Japanese army and more maps. This game being alpha stage is insane because it's really solid. I'm also impressed with the AI so far, just a little bit more ironing out to do. By the way, I think the flamethrower is insanely overpowered. It's literally instant death; you should be fine for the first one second. Overall, this game is really great, it's a shame only a handful of people play, but it's always possible to join a few servers. You guys need to start marketing this game.

Optimization could use work but as im typing this they have made some tweaks that have some major effects on performance which shows me that the team is listening to the community of this game. That being said the community is fairly small but healthy. You will find at least 10 completely full servers and then some mid ranges to choose from, which is nothing to complain about at all, but I know how some people like to base their purchase on these types of things. All in all if you enjoyed the raw style of gunplay in insurgency with the authenticity and map creativity of DoD along with very pleasing artillery shell sounds and all sounds together this early in dev is pretty impressive.

Additionally, artillery can only be called in by a lieutenant near a radioman.

Unfortuantely, this game doesn't deliver in the chat or mic spam but it isn't as bad as other games I have played.Day of Infamy does get the gun play, tactics, and feel of the game right.  I started out my very first game as the Whermacht, Germany's primary ground force during WW2.  As with Red Orchestra, I chose the machine gunner as I play best in support and room clearing when needed.  The feel of the MG42 and the MG34 were fantastic.  I enjoyed the meat gun feel as the Commonwealth troops dropped.  While I did poorly as expected in my first match, I had a good time and still came away with enough deaths by my meat gun to feel proud.The game runs on the source engine so a destructive environment isn't plausable, however, the sound effects are fairly fantastic and the atmosphere with the graphics and general mood of the soliders is top notch.  Most of the graphics for the weapons are still placeholders but they have the right feel for an EA game.  While the graphics may look a bit dated, they still are acceptable and can always improve.Radio commands, general commands, sound effects, controls, no HUD in Grit mode, and no way to tell how empty you are other than sort of keeping track makes this game one fun ride.  There is a classic mode that plays more arcade deathmatch but none of the servers are ever populated, and quite frankly, why would they be?  The game is all about realism in that you don't get a cross hair, a HUD, auto-aim, or anything else other than the number of mags or drums you have.  You have your iron sights or scope plus whatever else you choose for the class loadout.  Nothing to unlock which also adds to the game.  No more stupid ""play forever with this weapon"" to unlock another.  That's a dumb achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ idea that detracts from where these games came from.Overall, while it is still an EA game with only 4 game modes of capturing points and holding points, there is enough here to satisfy the FPS itch if you have one.  The community isn't huge but the game only came out about two weeks ago.  Once the game comes out of EA and gets more attention, we could have a good variant of Red Orchestra here.  The devs have a solid roadmap planned and patch the game as they can when bugs pop up.  Understand that it is an EA game and could easily go♥♥♥♥♥♥up as with any other EA game.  While I don't see that happening here, the big blue box warns you regardless.My vote, get the game.  It's not that much money and can fulfil hours of fun over the weeks to come.  It's probably going to be my new go to game since my strategy genre interest is starting to waine."

I couldn't see anything through the morning fog. Then I heard it, I heard it coming in the distance, I looked up slowly in fear that if I look away for too long I would be shot from the beach.It got louder as it got closer, a fighter plane, a fast one too. Coming straight for us, I yelled for to my men to take cover as it strafed our position. As I heard it fly away, I looked up after I knew it was gone. I look around, everyone in my bunker was fine, as for the poor men that were positioned on the side of the bunker near the sandbags, they didn't stand a chance. My men look in horror as they saw the dead and wounded lay there bleeding to death, some missing limbs or hands. I looked back at the beachhead I saw a flash ,  then I saw it coming towards us, a rocket! It hit the top of the bunker and somehow managed to ignite our flammentrooper's fuel tank.As my men start to panic the flames spread throughout the bunker room, killing the flammentrooper and 3 others, I can still hear it, their aganizing screaming for their mothers as they burn to death. In the confusion another rocket hit the bunker blowing a gaping hole into the bunker through the bottom. As the other squads try to counter the American advance, I try to call in support to help us stop the Americans from breaking through and overwhelming our bunker. But in vain I screamed, for our radioman was headshotted from a sniper on the beach. It was at this point I knew I had to make my last stand. I quickly pulled out my MP40 and sprayed at the incoming forces, after I ran out of ammo I panicked and pulled for my Luger rather than reloading. At that moment I was shot in the side from our left flank, I fire again till I also ran out of ammo in that magazine, and again I was hit. Only this time I fell on the ground, in pain crying out for help for my fellow comrades.As it starts to turn black, I could hear the Americans talking near me in the bunker, almost immediatly taking it after getting into it. Then before my eyes turned to darkness I saw the last thing I would ever see in my entire life , "" Git Gud Germans, you suck! ""Overall I rate 4 out of 5 burning Wehrmacht soldiers crying in agony, and a half of soon to be annexed Germany ( West Germany ).Edit: Its no longer in Early Access so it has a lot more players than it used to.

With the recent Beta release, the game is much more crisp and enjoyable.  I highly recommend this shooter, especially for those looking for more realism, tactics, and team-based play.  Many developers need to step-up like this when it comes to Early Access games.  I see some games still in the Early Access state that are two or three years old, and barely work, if at all.  This is unacceptable.  Versions of games that are that unpolished should be free.  This game on the other hand is one that I do not mind paying for, and I suggest you all do the same.  This is not like ARK, where they are releasing DLC content at cost before the base game isn't even out of Early Access.  This is a developer that cares, and it shows in their game.  Enjoy!"

I thought that since this game would seem to be much more improved than insurgency, I expected a variety of weapons, and maps, but I was wrong. Although there may be different factions providing different weapons, each faction has a very limited amount of weapons. This also is the same for attatchments, I understand that the game is based off world war, but i personally wouldve enjoyed the game to have more attatchments. On the other hand, I really love the character textures, they look very nice, and the cool thing is that you can unlock units(basically skins), I think that this is very unique and I personally love it. In my opinion, this game is in a way good and in a way bad, it sometimes gets boring, but at the same time, the unique gameplay style this game and insurgency has makes this game so fun which is why i refunded doom for this(doom was to boring for me)PS: I understand the game is going to add more, but this is how i feel about the game currentlyo...heres pros n cons for you lazy people who dont wanna read that paragraphPros-Improved texure/graphics from insurgency-Variety of classes-Awesome maps-Factions-Accurate world war weaponsCons-Lacking variety of weapons-Needs more multiplayer game modes-Barely any attatchments"

If you liked DOD:S, you'll enjoy Day of Infamy.If you don't know what Day of Defeat is, or have never played, that doesn't make Day of Infamy any less of a great game.

76561197995935948,Recommended,447820,33256467,Posted: 4 July,all,Shakespeare,Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat mod spawned Insurgency standalone which in turn has a mod called Day of Infamy. This is the standalone and highly expanded version of that mod. Game mechanics shared with the Day of Defeat games include timed spawn waves and capturing areas of the map as well as the World War Two theme. The game is always talked about as a spiritual successor to the Day of Defeat games but other than these similarities I think comparisons to either DOD game are unjustified and just plain wrong. It feels like the Source engine but with an added dose of realism so for fans of Valve's games it does well to scratch that itch without having to go and play ARMA or Red Orchestra or similar games with realism as the focus. Judged on its own terms this is a solid WW2 multiplayer team shooter with a lot of content. Be prepared to be stomped by veterans of this game. Easy to get kills once you understand the pace of the game and know the maps a bit.

My only gripe with the game is that because this is a somewhat-tactical shooter which requires you to compete for objectives, when you go down you have to wait to respawn.

This isnt your run of the mill run-and-gun shooter that you see other companies try and make, but rather a game where you might have to lay back and hold some suppressing fire before advancing through a giant wall of smoke.Also Dog Red has gotta be one of the most badass maps I've ever played."

I'm a history buff so world war 1 and 2 games like BF1, Verdun, RO2 and RS get me hot and bothered so when I saw this mod for Insurgency (back before it's standalone release and development) I instantly came. I've been waiting for a new ww2 shooter for the last few years ever since probably 2013 when I felt like we had given the era enough of a rest. It still took a few years but we have this incredible game. Now this is more of a tactical realism shooter with squad based loadouts and gear for whatever specialization you pick. So don't run into this game thinking it's CoD 2 with better graphics you'll have to wait for Battalion 1944 for that or buy days of war which got hit with a ♥♥♥♥♥torm and seems more like Day of Defeat to me. So in conclusion buy this game if you like ww2, tactical shooters, the M1 Garand clip ejection sound or are just looking for a game to play while Battalion 1944 finishes development this is the game you'll want."

Who's there? NOT F.D.RI used to be a grenadier like you, but then I took a .30 cal to the kneeWhat do you do when a volksgrenadier throws a stick grenade at you? PULL THE BEAD AND THROW IT BACKHonest reviewokay enough of the jokes. Day of Infamy is a tactical(sometimes) first person shooter. Although made on the aging source engine, as well as semi random lag spikes this game is a solid contender for the niche groups i.e (milsim,historical ect.).The sound is well done with colorful(explicit) quotes spouted out by soldiers in a variety of scenarios, nice gun sounds(more on that later), as well as dissapointing melee sounds(more on that later also).Graphicaly the game looks nice, although not the best looking game to come out in the recent period it looks suprisingly nice for a source game.Gunplay wise the guns are difficult to use in a full auto sense, although this adds to the fun and immersion as well as forcing players to play smarter, or bleed out on one of the many beaches, hamlets, fields, or chateau's of the western front. The guns also sound more like guns than playing with a multicolored pen in gradeschool.Melee wise the sound is a bit off with almost no difference between striking flesh and uniform as compared to striking the side of some poor abandoned truck. nontheless the melee weapons are challenging but fun to use awarding players with quick kills and PTSD.Model wise the soldiers look nice, yet generic. I expect this to change with the introduction of uniforms and soldier cosmetics.(nothing too over the top hopefuly). some of the props look like what you would expect from a sourcegame, but to my knowledge there is not really anything too appaling. The weapons look nice as well, higher quality than some of the propsBots. You cant ive with them, but you cant live without them either. Although called training fighting against the a.i is a challenge at first. They are good at what they do, as long as they wear the rondel of the opposing team. friendly bots on the other hand athough lively and making the world look alive, and on occasion lending a hand provide no large advantages overthe enemy. They will push you out of cover, botch grenade throws and sometimes kill you in horrible ways with fire. But they get the job done.(not really but if you are agressive the bots will be quite helpful in mopping up the survivors, granted you are still very vunrable and are probably better off using real tactics.)Violence is quite gratuitous in this game obviously with its attempted realism and gritty gameplay. Although bullets will leave bloody holes in characters regarless of being a sideways rucksack shot that actually never hit anything to cause them to bleed but this is able to be over looked. The gore suprised me by being more than low res random body parts, there is things like bones toes and otherthings that can be jutting from that jackboot that you just blew off. The blood splaters are nice looking but only apear in dismemberent or when something is directly behind the person who got shot. When hit by a nonlethal flamethrower shot nothing happens. It would be nice if they at least patted out the flames instead of just unflinchingly take it. On another note I find the flamethrower to be fun, powerful and very disturbing. every time someone uses a flamethrower and actually kills something they will start shaking on the ground convulsing with pain while screaming something awful, honestly this kinda freaks me out.Gameplay, the most important part. The gameplay is very balanced, with no team having a massive advantage(with exceptions). The gamemodes although kind of standard are still fun after all this time. my only complaint is the balancing in practice modebeing overwhelmingly against the player at times.FINAL VERDICTPROSnice soundssolid gunplaysolid gameplayviolence is well done (although it still gives me the chills)(NON GAME PRO) When you find people they usually are pretty nice.enemy botsNEUTRALmodels are generaly pretty good but the props and uniform blandness take it down a pegGraphics are not bad, but at the same time not great, although it still is a-ok by me for the sake of review its down hereCONSFriendly bots are more useless than a Hafthohlladung against Zimmerit.The melee sounds leave alot to be desired so for the time being its down here.(NON GAME CON) the servers are usually pretty empty or if they have people thry are the same kind of people that played day of defeat and scare away new players with their skills, although they generaly seem tho be nicer people.SCORINGSOUND-9GRAPHICS-7GAMEPLAY-8GUNPPLAY-10MELEE-5GORE-9OVERALL 48/6080% a B (much better than I did in Algerbra 2)IS IT WORTH IT?Like all things its a matter of opinion.

I don't think I need to go much into detail as to why, because most people have covered that. However, despite the fantastic gamepla, balancing and maps, I'm taking issue with how the developers are going forward with the game. I've been playing the game since it was a mod for insurgency and bought the game as soon as it was early acess, but the new class system has remove much of the customization that was previously possible, which sucks!! But the biggest gripe I have with the game is that graphics related bugs are rampant and not getting fixed. Infact, performance has noticable worsened over time (eg. 60 gps+ on high graphics on alpha was possible but now it crashes on high as soon as I join a server and even on medium I get 45-50 FPS). It is completely unacceptable that the stability of the game has worsened and made my game barely playable.

This definitely made me pretty miffed, as I'm a natural achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, but after waiting a while and starting to play the game again, it's only gotten better. The UI and the visuals are more polished, the guns have very responsive-feeling animations and sounds, the general audio design is wonderful, with screams and bullets going off constantly. This game is by far my favourite rendition of WWII in any media, and after release it's just gone up. One of the main problems for me though is how *sometimes* buggy the game can be. Often textures won't appear for me, I'll clip through walls and ragdolls will sometimes have major siezures. Nothing too gamebreaking, but it's definitely a bother. The only other real problem I have is the amount of people playing. I wish more people played this wonderful game, and cemented in FPS history. With insurgency and this, New World has really made a name for themselves, and both of the games, while very similar in some aspects, are masterful recreations of war scenarios. I'd recommend both this and insurgency any day."

When I saw this game it grabbed me, very simmilar to DoD (which is what it is based on) however it has alot of dramatic changes that alter the way the game works. For instance: I could never see why suppresive fire was any use, in this the defenders will be constantly putting down a base of fire onto you, stopping pushes but also retaliating fire (cause the in game effects of bullets landing neer you, obscures vision). Commanders, can call in artillery strikes and support as long as the radio opperator is around. The radio guy also allows team voice chat to be boosted to the area if your out of ear shot. I think what I love about this game is the fact that its exactly like the video and sometimes even better!I think what I am amazed by is that it is all this even as an early acces game. There arent many bugs with it now but despite that the devs still work on removing them.If your wondering about the price tag, well for what it is I would highly recomend it.

And in many regards, significantly so.For the Graphics Fiends, ""No,"" this title does not have bleeding-edge melt-your-graphics-card visuals, but it is VERY well done, nonetheless.  There are already a ton of mods that alter meshes and skins, and these can help buttress the graphics.Gameplay is where this title SHINES and stands HEADS  AND  SHOULDERS  ABOVE  its higher priced Big Title competitors.  Truly astounding.  If you loved ""Insurgency's"" gameplay, then you're certainly going to love ""Day of Infamy's"" efforts.I prefer to play single-player, and the bots are significantly better than ""Insurgency's.""  I hope that the development team rectifies that by importing ""Day of Infamy's"" bots into ""Insurgency.""  Yes indeed, PLEASE do this!:-DThey're quite smart, and can frequently surprise you.  The only AI issue that I feel needs addressing due to how the player can exploit it is that the AI rarely deploy grenades where the player's camping. - this is especially true if the player is at an elevated location.  Overwhelmingly, they'll rush in with guns blazing instead of tossing a frag/smoke grenade in first.  If New World Interactive can enhance this AI feature, they'll have truly fantastic AI in the game.One other AI adjustment that I will suggest: enemy AI are quite accurate shooting at someone with a flamethrower that's spewing flames in their direction.  When I'm on the receiving end of a flamethrower (terrifying!) I can't get a bead on the specialist because there is a LARGE  CLOUD  OF  FLAME  blocking my ability to see him.  So I suggest that they reduce the AI's ability to hit a target when their field of vision is filled by a billowing cloud of flaming death.The flamethrower is an amazing weapon to use in the game.  Its physics are incredible: the flame ""flows"" into openings believably.  It is quite a beast!  It's challenging to use too.  Don't use it too close to a wall - one will be very sorry if this is done.The number of game modes is large.  It extends the replayablilty enormously.  In fact, I want to see the additional game modes brought into ""Insurgency.""  Do you see a pattern here?  Yup!  Bring what ""Day of Infamy"" has into ""Insurgency."":-DFor those who are used to playing modern war via ""Insurgency,"" one needs to be prepared to handle weapons that fire much more slowly, that hold far fewer bullets, and that produce far more muzzle flash and recoil.  It's quite a hurdle, but one that SHOULD be there.  Stay patient, and within a couple of hours, you'll be in love with this title.There are a few interface bugs in the game as of June 27, 2017.  Mainly, one has to back out of the current ""Vote for Next Map"" screen to select a different map.  Also, occassionally bots will spawn with the enemy skin and with no weapons in their hands, but with the second spawn they're fine.8.75/10   A truly GREAT game and a fantastic deal at its listed price.If the AI gets a few adjustments and the two bugs removed, it'll be 10/10.Bravo New World Interactive!  Another masterpiece!Thank you for all of your hard work!"

,Recommended,447820,32923656,Posted: 28 June,all,ROZZ PURRRP,"8.9/10This game brings so much nostalgia it reminds me about my childhood with WWII FPS shooters. The game reminds me of Medal Of Honor: Frontline, Call Of Duty 2 Big Red One, Call Of Duty 3. It makes me want to go back to those days as a child playing on my PS2. The game is really well done and a more up-to date Day Of Defeat, with it's stunning Source graphics, blood & gore it's amazing. My favorite part of the game is that whenever a team mate is right in front of you they get blown up into pieces and your the only one who survived that attack and when you get blown up it feels ♥♥♥♥ing shocking but in a good way. But I feel like there's needs to be some improvements for future updates or DLC. The game needs a Soviet Faction and hopefully a Japanese or Italian faction in the game if possible. I also feel like there needs to be one more thing to be added with gore is heads exploding from rapid machine gun fire or explosives. The game needs to add a few more divisions/regiments for the 3 factions.Waffen SS - GermanyS.A.S - UK/British CommonwealthI'm not sure about the U.S. for now that's all I want from those 2 sidesAnyway the game is great and I could give it a 9 or  10/10 if these improvements happen in the near future."

76561198126613300,Not Recommended,447820,31987984,Posted: 26 May,all,Dimentia,"(the original review was written on march 25th, i haven't played since. And reason I am reposting it is because people were making blatent spam accounts to bring the review down since I apperantly ""don't like hardcore shooters"")The game is alot of fun in some areas. Gamemodes are (slightly) varied and it can be alot of fun for a hardcore shooter. BUT, there are many design choices that are simply unagreeable in my eyes. I will highlight the problems i have with the game here that make it unenjoyable.CLASSES:The class system is a nice touch, giving a limited amount of weapons as well as depth to your role. The problem comes from the OTHER factors to the class system. You'd not only need to be on the exact same map as your preffered faction to use your favourite weapons, but also need to hope the server you play on doesn't have a faction swap at the end of a round.example 1:You've been wrecking people as an officer on the american side of the Omaha Beach map. You've used your thompson to rack up a fair amount of kills as well as used the artillery strikes from your squadmates with radios to send in air strikes against the enemy. But then you are put onto the German side, and it turns to♥♥♥♥♥♥ The weapons the German side don't feel good. And doesn't exactly help you enjoy the game or contribute to the team. Yes there are weapons like the flamethrower which are copy-pasted through the game. But if you like automatics, you don't get a choice.example 2:You've just played on a map using the austraillian military. You've gotten decent kills with one of the guns and the next map is Omaha Beach (reason I reference this is cause it's the only map being played half the time). So you spawn in and expect to get the same loadout. WRONG, you've just been put on the U.S army and have new weapons which you don't know how recoil works, how to use it properly, or don't like the feel of the gun. TOO BAD! You need to use it as you have no other choice (other than to swap sides of course)RADIOS:The radio system is a nice mechanic. Either having people with the Radioman class or someone spending 3 supply points to get a radio to call airstrikes is a smart idea. The PROBLEM however is the communications link. Officers can't use these radios to talk to the troops, only radiomen themselves can. This also creates micspam issues as people can scream into the mic only to be muted, effectivley ruining the radios you have. It is a poor system I feel could be better.GAMEMODES:The main complaint of the game and I am no different. The gamemodes are all objective based so that means: no last man standing, no team deathmatch, not even CTF. Just (slightly) varied KOTH (King of the hill) modes. THis wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't as repetitive after only 3 hours (as of this review). Now, games like Overwatch did add last man standing/Team deathmatch modes in the future, and this game is new so it can be added. But variation is important for a shooter that has long XP bars and far as I can see expects to stick around for a LONG time.I do like playing the game, but these problems ruin it for me. When I get a game where I can just go american army and use guns I like. But the way the game's designed ruins it for me as is. And I can't reccomend it to my friends who play games similar in design to this but aren't this bad with game design in the areas I mentioned. There are minor things I didn't like such as no customization, but that didn't ruin gameplay. I focused only on the GAMEPLAY areas of this game. It just isn't worth it for me at this stage of the game. Until they fix the blatently poor game design choices I won't be playing much."

I love how the added content is free such as new maps and guns and units. The units are skins which can be unlocked through leveling up which I am fine with. The gunplay is good and just landing a shot with a bolt action rifle feels really rewarding, especially after somehow managing to survive a dual with a submachine gunner in close quarters. The addition of voice lines and ability to call in fire support via radio just adds to the experience which manages to differ itself from Insurgency(The sound of a Stuka dive bomber for example is really terrifying when you are on the receiving end), I also like how you can get cosmetics for your rifles after a certain number of headshots and kill which feels rewarding after you dedicated yourself to that one weapon.  My only complaint with this game is that sometimes the melee weapons won't register a hit when a enemy bot or player is prone when you are trying to bash their skulls with a shovel. Overall it is a great game and I am happy with my purchase."

The thing that sucks is that the player base is small, but don't let that info deter you from buying the game and here's why:*There's plenty of servers and 1 or 2 of those servers will be full or close to it!*I would say that this game is easily comparable to a hardcore FPS like Rising Storm 2*Customizeable characters and ranking up is fun. Not sure about loot drops yet. I haven't got the chance to play that much at all.*This game can be extremely difficult for some because of the realism, but I assure you, that if you hang awhile and practice, the game feels incredibly fun.*You will also get excited when you get a kill, last night, I killed a guy, reported it to my team and they even got excited, so the community with this game is super awesome.Like I said, my first impressions! 10/10"

The graphics are obviously outdated but the gameplay, bug-freeness and overall experience of the game more than make up for it.  The gameplay puts other AAA fps' to shame - It's realistic enough to immerse you ut not so much as to be boring and tedious.  As many others have said this is what happens when Insurgency sexes up Day of Defeat and many of the maps are actually recreations of DoD maps such as Avalanche and Donner.  No bullet sponges, no killcams, no hit icons, no kill notifications and teamwork is enforced by the gameplay mechanics - It's just plain awesome."

Day of Infamy clearly shows how much atention to detail ( don't know if that's two T's, LOL) the develepers put into this game. First, I think this is the only game that shows how to proberly use the Sten Mk. 2. Good Job. The only thing I request for this game (besides everything else from my review on Insurgency) is to carry some ammo for the Bren and MG42 even if you did not spawn with it. Fun Fact, every soldier from the Commonwealth was supposed to have two mags for the Bren. The same with the Nazis, except this time, ammo for the MG42. Don't do this for the BAR though, because the only people that carried BAR mags were the BAR operator and his assistant. Over all, great game and I really like. All most forgot, when playing on Solo mode, could the teammate AI me increased a little? I could not tell you how many times I have died from stupid teamates. Over all, great game.9.15/10P.S.

,Recommended,447820,34549994,Posted: 28 August,all,spidey,"Day of Infamy is a highly engaging World War II multiplayer FPS by New World Interactive, the makers of Insurgency. The game plays similarly to the aforementioned, but there are many new mechanics which improve the experience. For example, the multiplayer classes are unique and interesting; officers can call in artillery strikes, machinegunners mow down enemies with a storm of bullets, and flamethrower troops can fill whole rooms with liquid fire.Gunplay is smooth and satisfying, with hit detection that works impeccably. Because most weapons kill in one or two shots, combat is snappy and intense. Grenades and other explosives have a wide kill radius and help to break up stalemates on the objectives. The weapons in the game are straight from World War II and are modeled quite well. The smoke grenades look very good compared to many other games (CS:GO for example) and using them properly is key to winning games. Voice acting in the game is amazing, and hearing a German officer yell for artillery or an American rifleman curse when reloading really adds to the immersion.Map design is, in my opinion, miles ahead of Insurgency. Not only do the maps feel more ""realistic"" in their design but they are also well balanced and fun to play, with plenty of room to maneuver. There are a variety of objective-based game modes, each with a different pacing and overall feel.The main drawbacks of this game are lackluster graphics and occasional technical issues, but in my opinion none of this detracts from the amazing gameplay experience.In conclusion: if you like Insurgency, multiplayer shooters, or World War II games in general, Day of Infamy should be considered essential. If you don't usually enjoy those things, Day of Infamy just might change your mind."

,Recommended,447820,34064295,Posted: 6 August,all,MountainJew,"Wanted this for D-Day (dog red). It didn't disappoint. It's pretty hyper realistic in the combat style, if you get shot you die. But this doesn't take away from the game play.My only dislike is the Radio operators. If you're a captain and you need to call in an airstrike you need a Radio man near you and sometimes idiot players spawn as that class and run off into battle. On more than one occassion the only two Radio men you get run off together, die and stay dead till your next wave spawn leaving you without any way of commanding your artillery or planes.I don't get the wave limits either, sometimes you have an equal amount of waved and other times you have less VS more so the opposing team will always win if they have more waves.I'm not so keen on the other maps as I only came on to play D Day, would be good to find a  D Day only server.Also there's loads of mods to add to the game, was surprised to see they have a vietnam varient.Its worth the price, fun game despite my little complaints. I still like this game alot. It feels like a WW2 Verdun in some aspects. You can't just run around shooting, you need to think about what you're doing. It's also strikingly close to Hereos & Generals except no pay to play rubbish and no vehicles and you can change class mid game. Also all classes are unlocked, no real leveling system, you do get to unlock other factions of each power though. As Commonwealth you can play as British then unlock Scottish and other regiments which is cool, it's very historically accurate."

Granted maps aren't as grand as Red Orchestra, infantry combat is still very much enjoyable. With a decent selection of maps, a hand full of team oriented game modes and a price tag of $20.00 USD I can definitely say it's worth the buy.I give this game a peronal score of 8/10. It's not perfect and I wish it had more features, but it hits all the right spots in my book for an intense, team-based tactical infantry combat shooter without the ultra realism of a mil-sim.

,Recommended,447820,34085970,Posted: 7 August,all,NitroStarman,"Great game. So far the community that plays in co-op are nice and helpful. Haven't tried PvP yet.Bots can be random in their inteligence during battle. One enemy bot could be completely oblivious to you while others are watching their corners and windows like hawks, all in the same match.The gore is pretty good, too. Wished it was a bit more, like when a bomb or artillery shell directly hits someone, they just be blown to unrecognizable pieces. They still get blown to bits, just not as much as I like :)Teamwork is key. One bullet can be your end. Each class contributes to the team, even if it seems like just different loadouts. Machine gunners can lay suppresive fire while Assault goes in. Or the Officer and Radio man duo calling in support, which could be a supply drop, smoke artillery, artillery, bombers, or strafing run.Also, beware of Flamethrowers. One flamer can wipe an entire squad, either by him shooting flames or someone shooting his canisters."

WW2 will forever be a better setting for videogames for the variety and intricacy of the conflict. Having an array of bolt and automatic rifles, SMGs and light machine guns in settings ranging from crete to germany is just more diverse than automatic assault rifles with scopes shooting at each other in grey-brown-yellow desertsand concrete buildings.The detail is also very nice,like soldiers tapping thompson magazines to seat the first round,rifles needing to load blank cartridges to fire rifle grenades or connecting a wire from a rocket to the battery of the bazooka for reloading."

There's never a dull moment as battles can change tide at any moment. It mainly focuses on teamplay and pushing up on objectives to win which games like Call of Duty don't really give much merrit to. The intricate graphical detail, great weapon sound, weapon handling and well blended game mechanics keep you interested and gives a feeling of accomplishment after winning a match. The unfixed aiming deadzone of weapons can be a bit hard to get used to but when you do you never want anything else as it and the incredible atmosphere in-game gives you a feeling of unpresidented control over your caracter and is on my top 10 most immersive and fun games in my library."

Maps are cool, with varied amounts of open spaces, tight trenches and blown out buildings.I do wish the game looked a little better, but the gameplay is solid so I don't notice the low res textures too much.If you want a hardcore, somewhat tactical WW2 shooter, this is your game!"
,Recommended,447820,34221431,Posted: 13 August,all,zayuck,"This game, as you have probably seen from other reviews, is basically Insurgency WW2, and it's fun. There are multiple divisions in each army (basically skins for your character) and there are classes to chose from within the armies. They're the same with every army besides the obvious different weapons. The matches consist of capturing control points and advancing/wiping out the enemy's respawn waves. The damage model is relatively realistic, and gun sounds are phenomenal.To properly win the game you need to have an officer who knows what they're doing, which can be difficult because the player base is relatively small. (e.g. you'll join a game with 5 riflemen, 0 officers) A lot of teamwork is required to win, the officers have to have radiomen follow them around to call in airstrikes and resupplies, MG's for suppressive fire, etc.There are some elements of the game that favor the patient players who hold defensive angles, which can be frustating when you're on the offensive trying to rush in to a tightly-held point just to get mowed down again and again. The 'cover' is also not cover; Bullets will come flying through cement and brick and kill you instantly.The UI is also a little dated and clunky, some sounds are disproportionately loud (artillery/bombers), movement can feel glitchy, and the bullet penetration is a tad ridiculous.BUT this game is still like 8/10 and I would pick it up on sale if I were you."

And all of that at a cool $20? If what I just described sounds even remotely enjoyable to you, you're doing yourself a disservice by not purchasing this game immediately.It's winter 1944, and boy is it winter. The incessant biting chill that envelops each day, not to mention the unbearable cold of the night, has us all questioning how much longer we can keep up this war. I lay prone next to the humble machinegun nest we dug out last week, little more than some tree branches and packed earth covering a hole, and intermittently scan the shrubs and trees of the woodland ahead of us between the clouds of condensed gas that plume out in front of me with each breath.""Someone bring me the f**king radio!"" I hear from behind me. Did our officer see movement? My finger taps the trigger guard of my M1 Garand nervously as I squint and furiously study each piece of foliage ahead of me, ensuring it's not Jerry in disguise. And that's when it starts.The low, dull booms of impending doom sounding off in the distance. Seconds later, shells rain down on us one after another, belching out large plumes of smoke that completely obscure our surroundings. I can no longer see the machinegun nest, even though it's immediately to my left. In fact I cannot see more than a few feet in front of me. I cough and choke on the smoke, my finger trembling on the trigger as I hear gun fire open up. Our machine guns belch to life as bullets report above my head seemingly from all directions. I know the forest is alive with muzzleflashes ahead of me but I can't see anything through the smoke. A sudden explosion from a German grenade to my right blasts through a group of us held up in a ravine. There are screams as blood and limbs are launched into the air and scatter across the snow, staining it red. Another explosion rocks the top of the machine gun nest to my left, sending a shower of snow and earth on top of me and stunning me. My ears ring and I can't hear anything anymore. My eyes sting from the bitter smoke. All I can do is lay still and pray that with a little luck, I can still aim true.Suddenly I see a dark clothed figure appear out of the smoke ahead of me, running as fast as he can toward the mg nest. As if my body goes through the motions automatically, I take aim and fire two shots, stopping him in his tracks. Then another, from my right, emerging from the smoke, disoriented. He meets a similar fate. More explosions. Ceaseless machine gun fire. Men screaming, shooting, being blown apart, cowering in their foxholes. It's deafening. Another figure emerges from the smoke ahead of me. I take aim and squeeze off a few more rounds, dropping him just as he crests the top of the embankment. Surely I only have one round left in the clip. I don't dare reload. I don't dare move.Finally the smoke begins to clear. For the first time, I can see the bodies layed out all around me in a circle, both friend and foe, the smoldering blast marks from grenades, and the bloody body parts ripped apart by shrapnel. I marvel at the fact that I'm still alive. When I look up again I notice two germans are running back toward the treeline. I take aim at the one on the right, hold my breath, and squeeze off my last round. The clip is ejected with a 'PING' and he falls to the ground. Our machine gunner cuts down the other. And then all is quiet again. We did it. We f**king did it. Seemingly against all odds, we defended that objective and kept the Germans from advancing into the town of Foy.And that's exactly what happened last night while I was playing this game. 11/10 buy it now."

Day of Infamy is a fast paced game with alot of action and can't forget to mention the amount of Bombs and Artillery that gets dropped in a match. I want to list some Cons for people to be aware of. Firstly, the game has many bugs that I am hoping will get fixed, Secondly it does not have a very large player base, and last but not least this game does not have a whole lot of maps, but I would like to think they will add more in the future. Overall I really enjoy this game and can see myself playing it for some time. I would love to see the Soviets added to Day of Infamy."
76561197996544094,Recommended,447820,35009433,Posted: 16 September,all,Kathuc,"I like what you gotOverview: Day of Infamy is a team- & classbased realistic fps set in WW2. You will battle across multiple interesting maps reminding me heavily of the good old Call of Duty 1&2 multiplayer days playing on Caretan. There's a Dog Red map set in Normandy which look a lot like Omaha Beach from the movie Saving Private Ryan and the devs just recently released a Dunkirk map. Speaking of, they're the same people that created Insurgency but I haven't played that yet, so far. That said, the gameplay is very similar to Rising Storm 2 Vietnam, which I've also been playing and enjoying a lot lately. However the game is a trimmed down on the scope, there's a maximum of about 30 max. I believe, and the maps are generally more close quarters combat, with a few open areas here and there. I'll keep it short and simple from here on.Pros:Intense, and fast paced combatGreat feeling gunplayGood classbalance, though highly relying on proper teamplayAwesome voicework and sound effects, that'll give your battlecraving heart eargasmsRealistic kills with proper goreNicely varied mapsLoadout system (Pick 10  with a chance to increase the space by 1 with every 5 kills and objective captures) is skillbasedNeutral:Graphics are definitely dated, running on Source Engine, but it's not trying to be AAARelatively high skill curve if you've had no experience with more realistic hardcore shooters (can be a Con for you)As far as I could tell there's only cosmetic unlockablesCon:Playerbase is quite small it seems (Max. 800 players online is what I've seen with downtimes of 260)Therefore playing on a server with higher ping just isn't fun in a game which is about splitsecond reactionsVerdict:I got the game for 20$ after playing Rising Storm 2 for a while, because I wanted a change in setting and I was more than pleasantly surprised. For me it was worth it, because I've been a fan of shooters for a long time. Like I mentioned earlier it reminds me of the good old days of Cod 1/2, Medal of Honor and Battlefield 1941, but in a more realistic fashion to the gunplay, which really makes the game insanely intense at times. Knowing you're the last man standing in your team and it's up to you to potentially sneakly backdoor capture an objective could decide the game in or against your favor. Everything except for the graphics is top notch, and I really enjoyed the similarity in the class based system to RS 2 Vietnam with a Commander, who in this case specifically needs a radioman by his side to call in artillery barrages or smoke further expanding the focus on teamplay.So if you're a fan of realistic hardcore fps, with a fairly nice community and a potentially steep skillcure I recommend you grab this game now, before there's no one left to play with.Otherwise if you're just curious, maybe wait until the next sail or price cut to 10-15$, but like I said don't wait too long, I think this game might only have a few years left running.But still overall,I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT!!!"

Never ever had I needed to think thrice before pressing R in a heated battle when both my primary and secondary weapons are empty. AND THAT'S JUST THE ONLINE COOP MODE.Graphics are substanstial for an FPS game that's heavily focused on raw gameplay (ala Insurgency).Unfortunately, there are still minor framerate drops in the servers (despite <20 ping) and some animations are broken from time to time. In-game ambient lighting can be confusing at times when trying to differentiate between being in critical health or 'is that just the sunset bouncing off the walls?'.Overall, it's definitely the FPS game to play if you seek a challenge of all sorts."

,Recommended,447820,35503357,Posted: 5 October,all,[STD(g)]xXMLGROBERTXx,"Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally persued when he refuses to sulley the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honour.★★★★★It could be argued that Francis Ford Coppola's film of Mario Puzo's bestseller, at once an art movie and a commercial blockbuster, marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino).The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts, while Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch represents everything about old Hollywood that Coppola aspired to. The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton). This is a film that has entered popular culture: even if you've never seen it, you know the lines (""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes""), and some of the scenes (the horse's head). But there's more to it than moments imprinted on the psyche.With a period setting evoked by amber-tinted photography and Nino Rota's elegantly decadent score, The Godfather has dated a lot less than most films of the early 70s. It paces itself deliberately, making its moments of action and horror more telling for the leisurely paths it weaves between them. With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless."

It is easily worth 20€ if you are looking for:- an atmospheric and very immersive WW2 experience (excellent sound design, voice acting, character- and level-art)- ""classic"" multiplayer fps mechanics (class system, no weapon unlocks or kill-streaks)- game-play focused around teamwork (officer and radioman air support call-in)- diversity in maps, weapons, game-modes (singleplayer, co-op, multiplayer)- a ranking system that rewards progression with division unlocks (cosmetic only)- a well established game engine (smooth controls, runs well on older PC's)To me, this feels and plays like what DoD: Source could have been, if it had had developers that cared for their product and community like NWI does.

Period. The gameplay is fantastic and encourages teamplay through many very good design decisions. In Stronghold, you don't respawn until your team gets an objective done. This is such good design in comparison to a respawn timer. Same with Entrenchment: A player has to fall back to respawn team mates. The Gunplay is superb and encounters are usually fast and deadly in closed spaces. And coop is just great. The Bots are a massive improvement compared to Insurgency, and they are deadly, which i find especially important to have in a shooter without SP.Graphics:The graphics are...""not up to date"" explains it best. They are good for what it is, which is a Source-Engine based game. The FX are actually fantastic, but the Assets and Textures just lack in many places. Don't buy this for the graphics.Sound:One word: Outstanding in every aspect.Community:Small but so nice. Especially in coop, there is such a good atmosphere. Really helpful and acknowledging.Verdict:If you want a WW2 Shooter with tactical gameplay and mostly one hit kills, go for it. It is just worth the damn money and i love to see how a Studio actually cares about the ♥♥♥♥ing gameplay in a MP Shooter.If you don't care for coop and want bigger maps, buy RO2If you don't care for gameplay and want better graphics (which is totally fine) go for BF1 or COD WW2 instead."

This game keeps it down to Earth. Most of the time the player base is dedicated to winning the match, rather than just run around aimlessly. This title seems to attract a more mature crowd. It has a few different game modes that I think are fun. At the end of rounds the players use a vote system to select from a large list of different maps, and game modes on those maps.Don't expect to put an ACOG scope on your Garand, and paint it pink with canabis plants all over it. This game keeps to the real deal, the guns feel great, they perform as their real world counter parts do, and the game has a great rewarding system for leveling your soldier.Your soldier is your player profile that has stats and lets you level up. The in-game menu lets you pick from different soldier classes, and battalions. For example you can be the allies, and pick the Canadians, or Wermacht the German Fallschirmjager.It feels good to get an achievement on Steam for kills with the K98k. It feels even better when you get a cool veteran skin for the weapon in game at the same time.It also has a command element with the officer class. If you feel like being a leader of the team, you really can do it. You will have to command the team, and call in support bombardments, and airstrikes to help cover your team! It even requires a player to play as a radioman class to follow you into battle, and use his radio for the support calls.I have put a good amount of hours into this game, and I am greatly satisfied with it!"
