,Recommended,447890,24039165,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Piragon,Cat on a Diet is a dark and powerful period piece about the horrors ever present in consumerist lifestyles. Our protagonist has become so consumed with his own gluttony he is barely even capable of movement besides what is needed to reach new areas of the house to find substance. As a cruel uncaring God it's your goal in this narrative to roll his corpulent body into trash bins filled with cookies. Even though this will eventually lead to his painful and slow death we are unable to do anything about it. Perhaps in the end we are just the will of destruction working with and within this feline and thus creating a strange twisted relationship that neither one of us are capable of stopping.4/5 would recommend

Next to collecting the muffins and trying to get into the cookie jar, there are some cracks in the wall with hiddenThe story is cute with the few panels before every new section explaining what happened. The graphics seems to be quite easy that doesn't put much stress on the computer, the only complaind I have is that you either shut down all sounds and all music or then have them on; there's no slider or anything to decide if it's too loud or not.There's not much I can say about the game, I enjoyed it.Overall, I'd say the price is better if it were around 1 euro, but I got it with a coupon for 50 cent so I'm satisfied."

The cat is cute, the graphics are quite nice for a game like this, and while completing the levels isn't usually hard (with a few exceptions), the two additional challenges you get on each level (complete the level with a given amount of clicks, and get all the floating muffins around the map) are hard enough to entertain you for a while.If nothing else, get it on sale - it is almost free that way."

Getting 3 stars on a lot of levels is down to prayer, and that is not what I want from  a cutesy casual game about a fat cat eating cookies. I paid $0.50 cents for this game, and in its current state, I feel like I paid too much.The final straw for this game is that it is actually impossible. Level 8 of the Attic has a bug related to your screen resolution. I didn't even know that was possible. The game also doesn't allow you to change its resolution. The ""options"" page is a joke. I'm not going to bother finding a workaround on an otherwise easy puzzle just so I can get to another bugged out one a few levels later.I have spent 2 hours fighting this game. I don't want to spend any longer.Other misc complaints:-Takes ages to close out the game on fullscreen-Music is unspeakably annoying, never seems to change-Levels played were very easy if not bugged? This may be because I was unable to progress very far.-Power-ups are garbage, nearly no use at all-Costumes have to be equipped every new sessionI might occassionally retry this game if I see there's a patch, as I enjoy similar games. But as-is, I recommend you skip this one."

My cat does nothing like in them Youtube walkthroughs even though I do the exact same clicks at the exact same time?(?????)"
