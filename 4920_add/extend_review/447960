I couldn't even get the 3 dummies into the dumpster.Next day it took me a while to get the controls down, but once you do!  I'm doing DEATH SPINS.I laugh at scooping up zombies.  The ragdolls are hilarious.LOVE this game"

The dev does warn to wait for July for a proper VR tutorial and update, and the discount will remain until after that is added.Controls aren't very clear either, it tells you what two buttons do, but not anything else, so its a little trial and error. I had no clue how or if there was a way to restart the game without closing and reopening it when my excavator was destroyed.Kinda fun and amusing so far, though all there is in VR right now is controlling the excavator and smashing zombies with it before they start damaging your rig, unless I need to go through a ton of waves to progress.For a buck, or even the full 2 bucks it is without the discount, its amusing enough for me."

76561198127168330,Recommended,447960,23424633,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,justun_love,I got the game this morning and I have found 3 issues. I cant record gameplay. I am playing on a vive and it is comming through the vive but the monitor picture is black. I would like to show people some gameplay! You cant see the menu in the vive at all or on the screen. The game wont launch normally unless you launch it twice meaning it wont play as a normal game unless i launch it while in vr mode(way to change settings)...it seems to shut down the vr version and start the normal pc version.  Game looks awesome just want to share!

If you're looking for a decent zombie game for your Vive that ins't just another wave based shooter then you need to add this to your library.
,Recommended,447960,23426066,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,Moosedodger,"For a buck I've killed zombies with a big shovel.  I can live with that for a buck. Now if I were to dream, this would move around.  It makes sense to have to dig something up, and maybe bury some zombies.   Is there something giant in size to fight with my giant scoop? Of course if my machine breaks down due to excessive zombie gnawing on my treads then I should have to get out and make some repairs, maybe bash a few zombies, maybe climb onto my excavator and bash some zombies. I could drive my excavator onto a flatbed truck that hauls me to another area...  Have fun developing."

Not a massive amount to it at the moment but I look forward to seeing how it grows in time.   For the money it is well worth checking out"
,Not Recommended,447960,23491483,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,Decompiled,Within seconds I felt like vomitting. The controls are horrible and of course having the player inside a spinning platform is going to make them feel ill. I am very surprised this game doesn't have more negative reviews.0/5
,Recommended,447960,33101318,Posted: 1 July,all,[IHC] Yenski,"I wish there was a way to explain this without seeming rude.  I just didn't like the game that much.  It did however, deliver on what it was attempting to be.  The dev lost a bunch of money on it due to the low price and people not understanding VR, so I feel compelled to give this a thumbs up still.PROS-fun-dev is involved-VR support-affordableCONS-limited playability-somewhat wonky controlsIDIOTS-if you get motion sickness, it isn't the game!-if a game says VR, you need a VR system to play it"

There was no story whatsoever. & there were only 3 differen't version of zombies?  I know this game is still in early development but so far it's just bad. The game itself started out strong. Waking up, having no clue whats happening around you.  But once you step inside that excavator, thats when they game went down hill for me. There are only 4 modes. tutorial, clean up, survival, and head up. You would think each mode would have a differen't setting. Nope..... Same place and similar objectives. Maybe my problems was I don't have a HTC vive xD, but to leave this review on a good note. The MUSIC in the main menu was awesome!. Here is a quick gameplay.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8XzNMnDs1o"
,Not Recommended,447960,23440062,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,Zoid,Not a great VR game for those prone to motion sickness. I can play vive optimized games for hours with no issues but this made me ill within a few seconds. If you could control the movment of the machine with your head that would solve it.

And then its very cheap, id say worth it, you will surely be able to have a few hours of fun :)Gameplayhttps://youtu.be/oV9OveR5rF4"

,Recommended,447960,23671758,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,Zizi Thrush,"I'm recommending only as it has a reasonable price, I think it's a good few minutes of fun here or there. It's not amazingly dynamic gameplay, but it's an interesting enough twist to justify its existence in the oversaturated zombie game market. One word of caution is that if you get motion sickness, I might avoid it. I typically don't, but this is one of 2 games that's managed to make my eyes hurt and my stomach turn a bit. However, the little bits of fun that can be gleaned for the price is worth it."
