,Recommended,448000,21855105,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"Anyone being used to Sparkle knows that you need to eat nutriments so that your little sparkle can grow into a powerful organism that can be herbivore, carnivore or omnivore. So, you were used to the green, blue or red elements floating, with medusaes to eat or any other species wanting to challenge you. Besides, some levels were huge as you needed to use vortex to reach another level.That's Sparkle 2 Evo and Sparkle 3 Genesis.Erase everything you've learned because Sparkle ZERO, despite belonging to the same series, just wants you to grow a sparkle, without any tutorial and learning about the commands, that will be the predator of everyone. No more carnivore, herbivore or omnivore, no more faster sparkle or with a better range of absorption or with a better defense. However, everything else is still there: micro-elements that will grow your sparkle, jellyfishes still floating, other species still there to annoy you (bumpers that will send you far away of your food, parasites stealing it, etc.) and vortex to use if you want to evolve.You don't have missions anymore, you're just eating, growing in a deep blue sea, with white stuff all around. You still have that sixth sense that will guide you to the nutriments but now, your little one can also sense vortex or enemies and show the way to them, which is good because as usual, the minimap on your right corner isn't really clear. I've seen it because I recognize the symbol for a vortex. Now, on the map, you can also see species wandering around.I don't know how many layers exist because I finished the game before checking if I was at the end or not. I largerly preferred the ancient system of levels and missions, mainly because you can come back to them and keep growing in beautiful landscapes.I finished the game in 95 minutes, where the others took me more time to do it. I was kinda disappointed that I couldn't control anymore the evolution of my little sparkle thanks to the DNA manipulation and that I couldn't see my level, so that I didn't know if I was nearing level 50 or not. I managed to reach it quickly because I've cleaned every floor - in other words, I've eaten all elements presents and defeated every enemy.Sparkle ZERO has still a relaxing soundtrack, at least, the new developers didn't remove that good feature.I was under the impression that Sparkle ZERO was in reality the first game in the series, if I didn't check before if it was the case. Apparenlty, it's not. For me, it's a huge step behind compared to Genesis and Evo and for the new player, without any indication about the commands, it will seem impossible to use a vortex. I only managed to do it because I remembered more or less how it was for the other games.So, should I recommend it or not? I must say that the game is avoiding a thumb down because I still enjoyed the challenge, despite all the missing features that I liked. But if you want to try one of the Sparkle game, I would point you to Evo and Genesis."

A controller is recommended to play this game but not absolutely necessary. You control a sea-dwelling creature called a sparkle. The only thing you need to do is swim around and eat everything you can. The more you eat, the larger your sparkle becomes. When you reach the maximum size (level 50), the game ends.Your sparkle will look different depending on the type of food you eat the most. Unlike the other Sparkle games, there is no color to differentiate the types of food, and no tutorial or explanation of the mechanics, so I'm not sure how you're supposed to know what to eat to become the type of creature you prefer. I ended up just devouring everything and suppose I became an average sparkle, the 'omnivore' of 'Sparkle 2 Evo'.'Sparkle ZERO' is not a colorful game like the other Sparkle games. Look at the screenshots. It's practically a game in black & white. The music is rather weird: it came and went as if someone was slowly turning the volume of my speakers all the way down and then back up to where it was, and repeated this the whole time.Steam tells me I played the game for 87 minutes. In that time, I finished the game and got all the achievements. So it's a very short experience. It didn't need to be any longer, because the last 10 minutes or so I was getting bored with it already and just kept playing until the game ended, to get that last achievement to pop.I noticed two technical issues, as well:- when using a controller: after you opened any of the menu options and go back to the main menu, you can't navigate anymore (pressing 'up' or 'down' on the controller does nothing), so you have to use the mouse to navigate the menu;- when the game ends, the screen becomes white and freezes like that. You need to force a shutdown of the game by using the task bar (or maybe alt + F4 works too, I didn't try).I don't think I'll be recommending this game. I bought it for only 99 cents and enjoyed it for what is was, but it's way too short for its full price and 'Sparkle 2 Evo' is a better alternative because it's more colorful and more varied. If you like this sort of game and can buy it heavily discounted, it'll bring you about an hour and a half of fun and an easy 100% achievements, but that's it. I see no reason to play this game twice."

,Recommended,448000,21881202,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,Otter Chaos,"I reviewed Sparkle 2 and Sparkle 3, so I may as well review Sparkle, um, 0.  I'm not sure if this is meant as a reboot or maybe a tribute to Ringu, but for whatever reason, the new Sparkle game has a lower number.  Pedantic musings aside, I really liked Sparkle 2, and reviewed it as the best jellyfish eating simulator available.  The Sparkle games have held that title since Pac-Man, even though when asked if the creatures in Pac-Man were jellyfish, Toru Iwatani replied “I’m surprised that you made the reference to a jellyfish. The assumption must be from the transparency in their design and also their characteristics.”  You notice that he did not deny that the enemies in Pac-Man were jellyfish, so I'll just stick with that theory.Anyhoo, Sparkle 0.  The game is lovely.  Sparkle games always are.  This time around I get a sort of cyberspace cyberpunk cyberjellyfisheating vibe from the graphics.  It's you against the world, and you gotta bag and tag em chummer.  Sorry.  All that cyber talk brought out the Shadowrun in me.  Yeah, remember when Shadowrun was cool?  Hmm, maybe it never was, but I liked it.  I used to read the books, back when books were a thing.So, what was I saying?  Right!  Sparkle!  Back on track!  My reviews have been gettings so narrow that maybe like three people will even get the references.  I'm starting to feel like Dennis Miller.  So it goes.So the graphics are nice, as always.  The gameplay is more like Sparkle 2, very chill, no real danger, just eat jellyfish and pretty much any other creature you meet, with the ultimate goal of evolving your creature to become more bigger and such.  This process has been stripped down to the point that there are no longer evolutionary trees, and you just eat and grow without having any input, as if you were Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.  This may be a pretty big step backward in the series, but at least you don't have the spikey tunnels that plagued Sparkle 3.Overall, I still suggest Sparle 2 Evo as the best in the series, and I hope they return to the variety that game had to offer, but Sparkle 0 is still a good game.  Just a bit less so than fans of the series might have hoped."

There is no real goal to the game other than to evolve interesting creatures and store images of them in the gallery.Gamers looking for a game with a goal like the prior Sparkle releases would certainly be disappointed by this game, which is evident by many of the comments. I, however, love a truly casual/mindless game from time to time where I can just let my mind wander. This is an ideal relaxation/distraction game, no stress, just enjoyable music and creation.

Sorry devs.Time to give this a real review, now that I've beaten the game. I'll start with the pros;- Simple gameplay- Nice atmosphere/ beautiful graphics- Eat ****, get bigger; really fun to watchNow the cons....so many cons.....- No tutorial, not even a simple menu to show basic commands. Took me 5 minutes trying to get through my first portal before I gave up and googled it. For those wondering, it's the ""R"" key or scroll the mouse wheel down.- Bumpers. F***ing BUMPERS. They exist just to ruin your day. They make you want to strangle whatever idiot thought it would be a good idea to make these.  I don't mind a challenge, but those F******* BUMPERS.  I would suggest the devs balance these so they're not as aggresive, just my opinion.- Eating speed. Everytime you eat a little cube your sparkle's mouth closes for a second and he can't eat, then it opens and... you get it (except when eating enemy remains, those are how it should be). Now this alone wouldn't be annoying, but the devs made these little lines of cubes everywhere for you to follow that lead to cube fields or enemies. Problem is, your 'sparkle' moves juuuuust fast enough and eats juuuuuust slow enough that you have to hesitate at every cube i.e you can't just swim through the line to your objective and gobble the cubes as you go. It gets old....fast.- It's bland. While the atmosphere is nice there's really nothing to do but eat cubes and attack the 2 types of enemies. Bland.- Enemies die too easily, everything is a 2 hit kill. Jellyfish (?), 2 hits. Giant sparkle as big as you, 2 hits. It would be better if the other sparkles got more health the bigger they got, more of a real challenge.- No replayability. Once you've seen the first level, that IS the whole game. Once you've beaten it you have no reason to play it again.- It's short. Completed it in roughly 1 hour, I think. (play time is higher because I let it idle for a while)"

Takes about an hour to beat the whole game if you've played Sparkle before--I ended up leaving the game running another hour to harvest the bonus trading cards. It's minimalist on the details and gameplay, but very relaxing for the eyes and ears. This installment does not have the option to customize the evolution of your sparkle's DNA like in Evo and Genisis. 6.5/10"

Now, with that said, I enjoyed the little over an hour I spent getting all the achievements. I would highly recommend using a controller and a very nice big screen to play this on. The music and visuals really make for cathartic and almost rythmic gameplay. This may not apply to everyone, but I have the goosebumps while playing this game due to the millipede-like creatures. Overall, this is a great ""coffee table"" game for people to play, but I wouldn't say it's worth more than what I payed."

Easy and fast 100% achis.Very simple, very short.  If you like driving around and eating everything you come across as a single player game, this game might be for you.  Controls literally (and entirely) consist of ""hold left mouse button and steer"" with occasional attempts to find a way through annoying indesctuctible items.  I can't imagine why they made it controller compatible, but hey, it'll appeal to some hairless apes.I have to give a solid :thumb: to this game if you can get it in a bundle, but you'll spend more time idling out the cards than you will getting all the achievements and ""winning"" the game by becoming the biggest sparkle(""...or ARE you...?"" - which is literally the endgame text before a persistent whitescreen fades in.Forever.Further, the ESC menu is also pure white, and now can't be navigated, so you have to ALT+TAB out to kill the app.Yep, that's three intentional spoilers... but you read them anyway, and now know how it all ends, you poor sap.With that as the ""Ultimate"" commentary, this game just ain't worth the price tag of $5, and bears *nothing* even remotely similar to the satisfying organism development guidance that Sparkle2 held.Pros- fast 100% achievements- inoffensive and relaxing ""stoned"" ambiance- minor puzzle solving (i.e. ""hit things twice so you can eat the parts they break into,"" and ""some things can't be eaten"")Cons- fast 100% achievements means extra time spent idling cards, if you care about that- inoffensive ""stoned"" ambiance isn't something interesting past the first 5 minutes.  Also, it's not metal... boooo!- minor puzzle solving (i.e. ""your neighbor's annoying illiterate kid with Down's Syndrome can probably figure it out with one finger up his nose"")pure 5/10 - effort was put in, but nothing special was achieved... you get the trophy for showing up MMEU."

It had goals and progress.This game feels rather pointles and boring with minimized variety of what to do in game.Graphic looks like random fractals. I mean, not like specially modeled but like randomly generated orderless staff.There is same blue design for all following levels (devs said so on forum). Without even bits of scenery levels feel empty and one-dimensional.I don't like blur and chromatic aberration effects (they are nauseating and cause motion sickness) and there is no way to turn it off completely. Not to mention they are just a cheap way to hide lack of details which used way too frequently in many recent games.(Not sure what ""Tilt blur"" change, all cubes, creature tail and other objects still blurred, even if you uncheck it from options menu)White screen flashes (when you switch between menu entries) not a good solution when you play the game with mostly dark screens.After 10 minutes of gameplay I had half of achievements (it may hint you on how small this game really is).Note: time played is 15 minutes, three levels (I couldn't play it more because of above mentioned effects), the rest is idling for cards."

I think they called it Sparkle ZERO because of its zero replayability.You swim around and collect resources like in the other ones, but there is only a single kind to collect so its not like the earlier  ones where you evolved differently depending on which things you ate. Its all the same. There is no real difference between gaining levels beyond a chime noise, a sparkle of light and your character  becoming slightly larger.

I was expecting very little and yet got disappointed.The graphics are not goodThe music is badThe sounds are anything but specialThere is no story, no purpose, no evolution, no tutorial, no achievement tracking, NADA.All you do is swim meninglessly until the game lies to you ""You're the ONE, the biggest SPARKLE"".Why lie? Two seconds before I met a bigger SPARKLE I couldn't consume, gaining a level would have at best set me to the  same level as that SPARKLE.Oh, bugs. Even at the very end. When the game was supposed to congratulate me on getting to the end ... it bugs: screen turns white, you can hear sounds bu can't aything. Had to force close the game ..."

The only thing you need to do is to swim around and eat. That´s easy to figure out. To proceed to the next level you need to pass through those ""Vortexes"", but nobody tells you how and that variates with your operating system and software version, as far as I know. Then you are confrontated with new types of so called ""enemies"", which can´t do any harm to you. And yes, continue eating to grow and ""evolve"" randomized, which only increases your size and changes your look. All in all I don´t really get the exact meaning of this game, the concept is neither anything innovative nor anything interesting, it feels like the developers wanted you to figure that out by yourself, since there is no explanation or anything like a tutorial. There is the option of taking photos and store them inside the in-game gallery, but there isn´t even any point behind that, except of getting an achievement, but, as with all the others that happens absolutely random without you even knowing about. No, not even the achievements make this game better, they are more like ""decoration"" you unlock automatically while playing. The sounddesign isn´t bad, but more confusing than usefull. If you now wonder how I can still recommend Sparkle ZERO, read on:THE GRAPHICS ARE SIMPLY THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.By that I don´t mean the quality, I mean the general design. Everything in this game, including settings and main menu are simply pure epicness. That´s basically the only reason allowing you to keep playing, despite the boring uselessness of Sparkle ZERO´s gameplay this is still an experience.Fact: Sparkle ZERO is bad at beeing a game, but instead this is one of the most epic looking ""screenshots-generators"" the world has ever seen. So if you wanna play a game, look elsewhere. If you want to create an epic, futuristic, SciFi-like and unreal desktop wallpaper, get it in the next mass sale, like I did.Thanks for wasting you time reading this!Final score:1/53/1036/100"

If you don't own any sparkle games, get Sparkle Evo or Evo 2 instead. If you already have those and liked them, you might get this and genesis for completing your series. Recommending to people who actually know and like the gamestyle. Not recommending it to people who's new to it. You almost won't miss anything."

,Not Recommended,448000,35510296,Posted: 5 October,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Clicker - FastAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Outcompeted. Showcase-grade barebones unity engine feeling twitch reaction game about eating pellets in an open environment. Audio assets cut off and start again randomly.Feels like a unity engine demo. Has this 4X/Space vibe to it because of the sound effects, color palette, wormholes, and odd components that make up the creatures. Went through about three or four wormholes. Nothing was a threat. Eating pellets was boring. Game didnt seem to know how to grow me past a point and just started overwriting previous features to elongate the body like a snake. Was rather disappointing. Movement often feels clunky as you grow which does not feel like a reward. Going to a wormhole is supposed to zoom you out and have you deal with larger creatures but the game just spawns more of the same stuff which defeats the purpose. Either go play Insaniquarium if you want a small fish eaten by big fish game or go play Spore if you want a proper life simulation. This has Xbox360 pad support but you still need KBM to navigate menus which defeats the purpose. After four levels the game would not let me progress through wormholes anymore. Combat and pellet navigation was super repetitive. Removed for declutter."
