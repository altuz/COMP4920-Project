76561198219434583,Recommended,448020,22786830,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,AhGooseTeen,"*Edit*Changed review to positive. The developer listened to the community's complaints/feedback, and has made updates to the game that make it more ejoyable and playable. I got a few good scares out of the game so far (I'm a big baby though, so you might not find it scary), and to me, it has been worth the $5. The addition of hints made a MASSIVE difference, and progress is now attainable. My only negative is that you might find the enemy models to be comical after the initial fright of them popping up.Thank you to the developers for listening!*End Edit*I really want to like this game, but I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down for right now (which, judging by other negative reviews, looks like bots or something are going to rate this as unhelpful, but whatever). If you want to grab this game, here is what to expect:I found that this game is really lacking direction. It is so hard to figure out what to do next. I've been muddling around for 45 minutes and have made very little progress. It seems like you have to work your butt off to get to the scary part. The game looks very promising. Gearing up to defend yourself at night sounds like fun, but the developer needs to either make it easier to get to that point, or give some direction in game. I will edit this review based on future updates/sessions of the game. Here is the first 45 minutes of gameplay condensed down to 10 if you want to take a look.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF0qUPNC2ME"

It's a nice idea in theory, your car crashes (conveniently directly outside a house). So you take a look inside and find..... nothing. A banana in the fridge, a load of pictures to throw around and a key to the garage is about it. Do a couple more things and you'll end up turning all the lights off and then die, because of some little goblin thing(?) restart and survive because screw that little goblin!The issues in this game are that the atmosphere is far too thin. There's no explanation of why you're doing what you're doing, you drive like a crazed granny on liquor, opening anything is more of a puzzle than a smooth contextual click because the reticule and the cursor don't seem to match up.Each time I've played, it just felt like more of a chore than a fun romp through a story. Even if it were drip-fed through notes, ANY context would have been good. The best part of the game is the box kitty."

It might get better as the game goes on, but I didn't buy it planning to invest in slogging through a weak opening to get to the end.Specifically, a lot of the little improvements I expect from an indie game with weak (retro?...ish) graphics weren't there. There were a ton of cubbards and doors with nothing behind them, but there were also plenty that inexplicably didn't open. Some that did open were very hard to open because of the controls and height of the in game character (ie you have to target the handle, and can't crouch as far as I could tell. No controls guide, probably to support the minimalist aesthetic). I found a ladder that I could pick up, but after that all I could do was set it down.This game just didn't feel like enough was put into the house, which as far as I can tell is the key set-piece for the game."

It is bugged, tips are stupidly not helpful though they kinda make atmosphere a little bit, hitbox for objects is so ♥♥♥♥ing small I was desperately clicking my mouse to the point I thought it broke.Horror bits were predictible and almost all of them were bugged. I was laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off when that creature in pond was waiting for me to return to the shore.

76561198039267002,Not Recommended,448020,26501367,"Posted: 9 November, 2016",all,MegaDoom,"This is one of the worst horror games I have ever played.The game has no story, and the game asks you to perform tasks with no reason why. For example, the game asks you to find a way to turn the power on, and that kind of makes sense, but why do I have to turn all the lights off? So a jumpscare can come at me? That is poor level design.The monsters are some of the most pathetic I have ever encountered in my life. There is this witch that is the color white all over and has absolutely no texture. Her animation is robotic and parts of her body clip through the floor. The fact that she looks so hideous (in a bad way) eliminates all fear from the game. There is a swamp monster sticking his head out of the water that you can clearly see, before he jumps out and tries to chase you. Was it really that hard for the developer to stick the monster just an extra few feet under water?The game even stoops to freaking you out with pictures that look like were downloaded from Google images.It tries to scare you by having random unexpected jumpscares occuring throughout the game, yet without any tension build up, the scary encounters are an absolute joke. The game goes the Silent Hill route by having surreal encounters like a giant baby walking in the woods, but do not think for a second that it does this game any justice, because the game grabs random elements from other horror games and just throws them in here, and there is no consistency.The environment is big yet not worth exploring. There is little of interest, the levels are drab and boring and look like trees and bushes were just pasted on without attention to detail. There is a dog, yet there is no owner. The fridge just has one banana in it. You can pick up picture frames, yet there is no reason to do so unless you want to drop them on the floor. The person who made this has no level design expertise.To be fair, the only reason I bought this game was because it was on sale for 74 cents on Steam. I have had scarier experiences playing free horror games, and they are much more well done and executed than this game.Bottom line: I want my 74 cents back."

Don't waste your money. Share is an interesting game to be sure. There are details placed in the environment that will make you look twice...but the atmosphere is not immersive, the goals make little sense, and it is easy to find yourself wandering in circles, wondering if you missed the content that is supposed to make this game awsome. This is a short, clumsy, lackluster experience with a little quarkyness on the side. You'll spend 14 minutes with dead face, trying to find the windmill, then 25 cumulative seconds saying ""The f*ck just happened?"""

This game.What it really done to me is to be explained as a strange and psychtrophic mix of non-understandable story and endless swithcing of the lights.I mean - WHAT?No adecuate clues, no real storyline, no good textures at all. You know, even though it is just an indie horror and it is about to bring you not the story or graphics, but I can barely understand why the developers didn`t just sit with this game for a littlt more (developing it) and brought it here to the sheer public.. That`s strange at least.Well, summing up this mess: scary moments here and there, no story, strange creatures and no real idea. But for a first try in developing games... Well, should be fine.But what I think is that they take the money not for the game, but just for the hours and hours of job that they`ve spent developing this contraption. Not really worth it.Но ХФМ сё равно ТОРТ! Так что рекомендую, ахахаха!"

Also, this does not fix the technical issues outside of the car, so most of my review is still valid. Another complaint I had about the game, since the dev seems to be listening to reviews: make the clickable space for interacting with objects larger. I hate having to move my cursor to a very specific tiny point on an object to interact with it.This was a game I got in the spirit of, ""♥♥♥♥ it, I'm feeling adventurous, why not spend 5$ on a game that has no reviews (in my language) and that literally just came out?"" If this game taught me anything, it's that being ""adventurous"" is overrated. This game sucks. I honestly couldn't even make it past the beginning because of 2 reasons: 1, two of the tools that i think I needed to progress just glitched away through the ground. I had just picked up the axe and was just trying it in vain on every single thing to see if SOMETHING would happen. Something did happen when I used it next to a window: it glitched INTO the window. Couldn't pick it back up so I got a crowbar and the same thing happened except with the ground. The second reason is that godforsaken cat. He just keeps mewing and mewing and the first 2 times he mews you think, oh how cute. The next 2000 times while you're trying to figure out what to do next is annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Animations are♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you jump your hands stick out like some clay model and when you pick things up you look the same. The only redeeming factor of this game is that the car controls at the very beginning aren't complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ but that doesn't matter since that part ends really quickly. Requested a refund, don't waste your time here unless you have a fetish for poorly designed games."
