That's right im talking about WASD keys. There is nothing. You have given ONE movement / move key which is RIGHT Mouse button, lol? and LEFT mouse button for shooting, that's right! It's so stressful to run away and at the same time trying to aim properly and shoot without getting cought or killed. You just can't spam your LMB to shoot, no you actually have to aim your coursor on zombies to shoot them.Okay, back to WASD disscusion on forums, so that thread was started back in March and there still isn't any reply back from Dev whatsoever. So yea.If you still want to get this game, i suggest you to do more research on it.A Fine investment!JK"
,Not Recommended,448070,25974813,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Sam,"This game is painful to play.To start, the controls are absolutely goofy. You right click to move and left click to attack. your inventory and such is on E and Q so you would assume you are able to use wasd. That is not the case. This weird control scheme makes it almost impossible to kite the enemies that you are fighting against.The enemies are all pretty much the same and you are given 3 equally useless characters which you can play as.First character: goofy pistol lady who's special ability make her shoot faster. She sucksSecond Character: goofy melee guy who is impossible to play as because though he does do damage, you need to be next to an enemy to kill them (obviously since he is melee). This wouldnt be a problem but there is a delay when you left click which makes it so you are inevitably going to take damage every time you attack people.Third character is the most viable because he is actually usable.On top of the garbo gameplay, when you first load the game up, your eardrums are blown out by generic metal music which is extremely loud.2/10 at least they tried. At least the trading cards were cheap :)"

The problem is, when either him or I am starting a multiplayer, the name of our games pops up but when me or my friend clicking join to server the same happens: The server is either full or offline it says. WHY? So we cannot join eachother in the multiplayer mode, and the server list is totally empty. Is there a way to change the ports or something?"
,Recommended,448070,23899922,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Dark_Wolf901,"I'll start saying that the price is fine considering the general offer. It has achievements and trading cards wich is a very good thing.The game is an arena shooter and your goal is to survive all 10 levels of each match, there will be regular enemies and some bosses that can be pretty difficult to take down. After completing a level you gain a point that can be spent on ammo, water, food, or health whose levels must be checked in order to keep your fighter alive. There are three characters available: a guy armed with a sniper rifle, a girl armed with two pistols and a close-combat guy armed with an axe.It can be played in single or in multiplayer with other two people. The latter option is recommended even if there aren't many people to play it online, it's better to have a friend to play with.The graphic is not too bad considering the price.The soundtrack features a death metal theme that fits perfectly with the game's atmosphere but gets repetitive being the only song you can listen to.Sadly I have to make and important complaint: the movement system doesn't allow you to use WASD, but forces you to move the character by pressing the right click button of the mouse and moving it in the direction you want to go. This should absolutely be fixed. The mouse should be used only to aim and shoot at enemies.There are way better games available but I'll recommend it for the trading cards and the achievements."

,Recommended,448070,29734445,Posted: 5 February,all,Paul Atreides,"Red Risk is a very solid little game, in which you fight as a modern gladiator (up to 3 players on coop) against infected and (heavily) mutated creatures.You might struggle with the controls at first, but will find out after a while that they actually make sense. Kite (drag along) your character with the right mouse button, and fire or hit with the left (target must be in range). No need to click that much, just keep the left button down and aim at the closest enemy. Reload your gun with R (not in the manual). Space bar for some extra fighting power.(I highly recommend Jason and his axe to start with. Again, keep the left mouse button down and aim always and only at the closest incoming monster. Do not re-click, he will do all by himself. Use Space for a 360 spin all 3 seconds. Don't run when you are surrounded, just aim.)The game is easy and casual, one tournament takes about 15 minutes. Find friends in the forum for coop! Select different characters, higher difficulties and other maps for new challenges!The graphics are sweet, with some unique ideas, but of course, don't expect it to be a 50 USD game!Also search the Community Market. Red Risk has some cool items there. Look at the cards for steam leveling.Have fun !!"

,Not Recommended,448070,24228325,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,Hitzugy.J.Pax,"I personally can't recommend this game for the following reasons:- ""Microblast Games"" developers design a bipolar controls: Left Click to strike/shoot and Right Click to movea. If you are playing as Jason (the melee character), it is an advantageb. but if you are playing the ranged characters you just will lose much time of target and run.- The enemies sometimes hit you by only shake hands. The animations of their attacks are just bad.- You can be pushed out the arena, but not enemies. They alway have the Final Fantasy Auto-Float magic activated.- The history is poor, the abstract said ""Fight for freedom or money"", but at the endnothing happens- I know is a low cost game, we can't expect to much, but when you literallycompellest the players to spend 72 hours to obtain the 3 Steam trading cardsyou have my displeasure,cause you could beat this game with all achievements maximum in 4 hours.PRO's- Fulfilled the meaning of hell (b*tches, pole dancers, demons, zombies, a red world without mercy)- Interesting survival additions as starve and thirst percent (%) more realistic to me.- The heavy Soundtrack help much to feel the world-end experience.- Each character have a special movement.Nothing else to add, if this game would have been at least character customization (weapons, accessories, skills) the game would be more acceptable and would not have many annoying users giving thumbs down."

I don't bother saving these when I write them, so here's the condensed pros/cons and overall rating.Pros:-Good concept.-Awesome monsters, creatures and overall solid graphics.-Multiplayer would be awesome...-Easy to pick up and play.-It's not technically broken and glitches are few (i.e. it'll run, it saved my progress, didn't crash, etc.)Cons:-Many unfinished ideas (thirst/hunger system, empty inventory screen, etc.)-No strategy involved.  Enemies just run at you and are easy.  Sheer numbers disguised as ""challenge.""  Their attacks are all melee or cheap status FX like poison, stun, etc. from which there is no cure from because there's no inventory system even though it has a button!-Terrible controls.  It's an action hack n' slash with hack n' slash RPG controls (left mouse to attack/right mouse to click and move).-Huge delay in when you can attack enemies.  You have to target them individually, again like a hack n' slash RPG.  The combat is generally slow, slow, slow.-Every arena seems to have the same 10 waves of enemies.-Only 2 moves per playable character.-For my money, the projectile characters are weak, unbalanced, slow to reload and useless.  If there was multiplayer I could see there being strategy or fun in choosing them but not in single.-Zero variety in gameplay which gets boring FAST.-Level up system is worthless (your health caps at 200 a few levels in).-Game seems to be a month old and NOBODY is playing multiplayer it seems.  That should have warned me.-Though the 4.99 budget tag seems tempting, I got more content out of the 99 cent Reveal the Deep than this game.Overall:  3/10This game is POOR and because my review wouldn't post here for whatever reason, someone deleted it in the discussions.  Obviously the developer.  I feel ripped off even for 4.99.  There's no variety, no strategy, every arena is more or less the same with just different graphics, no moves, no inventory, no point to most of the gameplay decisions etc.  Where this game could really shine is in multiplayer but a month after it's out and nobody is playing.  As a single-player game I'll slash through it for a bit just because I spent the money but even Gauntlet and Hunter: The Reckoning seem like tactical marvels when compared to Red Risk.  You won't even need to manage thirst/hunger because you'll find enough pick-ups to do so.  Even if there were a few items like a room clearing bomb or some once and done abilities it would have upped the fun quotient.  You hack through an arena, earn enough points to enter the next slightly different looking one and fight (thus far) the exact sames waves as the arena before.  I mean...it feels like there was minimal effort put into making the game which is a shame because even though the monsters are mindless, they are pretty cool looking (especially the bosses).Even diehard hack n' slash fans should avoid this one.  Without the ability for 2-3 player co-op you're going to get bored fast.  I'm going to at least try to get another arena in (I've earned 500 points thus far in the second one), but if things don't change after that this is getting uninstalled.  I should pursue a refund like I did with Kidnapped (which I couldn't even finish due to glitches and got my money back), but I'll play this some more begrudingly and consider it a lesson learned.  It's a real letdown as the premise of this game reads like a modern day Smash TV which is one of my favorite shoot 'em ups of all time!  This game isn't even a 1/12th the game that the Smash TVs were!"

It's downright awful and an immediate regret. I bought it because it was cheap and I was looking to see if I could find a gem as I often do on Steam. I read the reviews and figured if this many people like it, how bad can it be? It can be really bad, trust me.It's not even the graphics or subpar animations that bother me, it's simply the core gameplay itself. Terrible controls,  every enemy I've ecountered so far will only attack you by melee, and it doesn't even look appealing when they do so. With the sniper rifle, you have to press ""R"" EVERY time you shoot to reload.There was even an enemy that would constantly stun you, so if you were to play with the melee character you'd have to constantly run away and heal, though the monster stunning you can catch up to you with each stun, no matter how far you run away.This brings me to another point: each character only has one weapon. If you were expecting different and better guns any character can use, you'll be just as disappointed as me.This game was clearly meant to be multiplayer but I wouldn't dream of convincing a friend to waste his money on this.I did like the way the enemies actually looked, but that's about all the good I can say for this game."

Oh yeah, you also have XP (that affects nothing, except the # of your level), each character has a unique power-up (boring as hell), and there are new enemies each wave, but honestly -- you won't even notice all of that behind the controls.Game is really hard even on the easiest difficulty. Not because it has some mechanics that'll make you work around them for days, no. Simply because the controls are messed up beyond any rational point, and because enemies are so poorly balanced -- you'll encounter a mob that'll keep stunning you, making it nearly impossible to complete the level with anyone, except one of the characters.I can write a few more flaws (like really boring sound effects and music), but honestly -- this game isn't worth $1 dev's asking for it.
