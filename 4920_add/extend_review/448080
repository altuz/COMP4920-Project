If you do own an XBOX ONE, though, get it there unless it's on sale for a lower price here."

,Recommended,448080,27873764,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,Pike,"A really simple game to get working. You can have up to eight players (on phone, pc, tablet - all at the same time). You just need one copy of the game and access to internet. A real hit for parties and lazy evenings in. Cheap at the price i'd say. :-)One tip if you can: Hook up your main pc to a television with an hdmi cable (or some such). Get the narrator and the questions up on the big screen and everyone else can sit round on their devices to play. We even had one of them answering questions from upstairs whilst they were looking for something.Also, prepare yourself for learning a lot of random useless information."

Even parents.The game gets more fun and difficult the more players playing at a time (up to 8)The game also gets more fun the more drunk you and your friends are.11/10 would lie and♥♥♥♥♥♥myself again.
,Recommended,448080,28670032,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Holocene - Moving House,"Fibbage is a really fun family/friends game where you main objective is to make up false answers to questions. Players score points if the other players choose your answer and also you score if you manage to actually select the correct answer/definition. Bare in mind all players require a smart phone or something like an ipad to play and an internet connection. The only down side I can really say is it is just one game that'll last 10-15mins. So playing a few times is fun but may get a little repetative if you kept playing over and over.Overall a fun little party game to play with friends or family, worth buying."

76561198006030173,Recommended,448080,30926998,Posted: 3 April,all,Alfonzilator,"Awesome!! This game is everything you need for a small get together. I love the Jackbox games and this one definitely doesn't dissapoint. The cons are the exhaustable questions so you start to see the same ones coming up over time. Also if you live in a country other than America where the internet is usually faster than the speed of light, it does have some issues when you are playing 8 players. People get kicked or can't even get on the server, that may just be a China problem though."

,Recommended,448080,29214390,Posted: 12 January,all,PandaJerk007,"How to play:(game for 3-8 people)-	An unusual fact is given to the players, but a key part of it is left blank.-	Each player thinks of a believeable word or phase to fill in that blank.-	The correct answer to complete the fact, as well as everyone’s guesses, are all displayed as a multiple-choice quiz.-	You have to try and figure out which answer completes the fact, and not be tricked by the other realistic answers.Positives:-	The game is easy to setup and understand.-	The gameplay stirs up everyone's creative juices.-	The game is a sure-fire way to get people talking and laughing.Negatives:-	I honestly can't think of any.Overall:You WILL enjoy Fibbage XL if you play it with family or friends. It could even be a good ice breaker to get to know new people.Instead of buying Fibbage XL bundled in a ""Jackbox Party Pack"", I’d recommend getting it separate. Simply because it’s cheaper that way and it already offers so much gameplay."

Me and my friends played 2 rounds and they were all great. I recommend this game if you have friends that would play it with you, because it's tons of fun and you dont know what questions or answers you might see.Pros ++Funny questions+Up to 8 players per round+Can have an audience to like answers if you use Twitch ( I think? )+Good game to joke around withCons --Other players can't see who won, how many points they have, or anything besides entering a lie and choosing a lie/truth.-Other players cant even see whos lie they chose, leading the person who owns the game to say whos lie they chose if they REALLY wanna know"

,Recommended,448080,35409873,Posted: 2 October,all,mimsiegrew,"Entertaining party game that adapts well to the group playing it. Being able to play using your phone/device gives it great accessibility without the need to have hundreds of controllers. Limited playability due to cycling through all of the questions eventually, but that's the nature of these games. Would highly recommend."
