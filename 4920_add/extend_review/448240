,Not Recommended,448240,25264078,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,Abstrakt Dre',"If you're one of the developers reading reviews, please read my ideas on how to improve upon this game and perhaps make a bit more money, because sadly, it hurts me to say with all the potential this game has; the repeditive deathmatch-style ""WORMS ATTACK"" gameplay kills it short... I feel very confident that my concepts can fix the terribly boring aspects of the action gameplay.OVERALL=7/10 -""Yes. oddly enough, this is still a negative review""._Review & Word to the Developers_--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I barely know where to start.. Okay, I seriously LOVE/HATE this game.Like at the same time..LOVE THE IDEA, Suuuuuuuuuper original! But, I have my issues with it.Now as I break it down for you on the GREAT and the UGLY, keep in mind that the game is in BETA!!! And probably will be for the next year over.**(And to all the negative reviewers jumping-the-gun over $6 saying this game is crap because no one plays online, you should go read the definition of BETA testing and take some notes. 99% of the negative reviews are mostly about the **BETA** multiplayer servers anyways.. Like, give the developers a break bro they heard you all the first hundred times about the servers. Give them some time and give the players time to buy the game. All in due time my friend. :D )**lol.Okay, so Hybrid Animals is a really GREAT start with the system in which you can fuse and create your own creatures (LOVE IT), and as I see it, if the game as a whole is done right- I believe it carries the potential to start it's own evolution-based genre for future indie titles.Additionally I honestly believe that what the developers decide to do with the mess that is Hybrid Animals action style gameplay from here on out will decide the success of their company in the long term as a whole- the total money, big or small that they will make (and their product's popularity) from Hybrid Animals will accurately reflect the quality of their final product = knowing the Steam community, it serves as the perfect representation of the effect their future choices in developing the gameplay have and how the final product will sale.I gave this game a 7 of ten only because the hybriding system deserves that much, at the very least.-The originality of the hybriding system is it's main fun & major selling point. It's just plain addictive combining animals over and over and over and over again; It's definitely a similar addictive gameplay to how Pokemon is addictive due to the evolving factor.-But Hybrid Animals also *definitely* deserves those 3 missing points. The gameplay is just a flat out disappointment. I fear that the developers may not take advantage of the originality and accomidate it accordingly with gameplay that takes absolute full advantage of the very addicting creating and hybriding aspect that is this game's greatest selling point.-My biggest fear is that the developers will stick with their seemingly quick-to-finish crap gameplay, **In which mimics every cheap-indie-multiplayer-steam-shooter-that-everyone-wants-a-refund-for-because-they-thought-it-would-be-cool-but-ended-up-hating (Screencheat) genre of games perfectly (I'd be willing to bet that everyone reading this has bought atleast one or two of those crap TrickYouForYourCreditCard games).Please, PLEASE AbstractGames, do not take the {insanely CLICHE} route that the gameplay currently holds and leave us 6 dollars short with a final product that has the only selling point of interest being the hybriding system, because this game has TOO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE A GREAT INVESTMENT AND A GREAT GAME! Because the action sucks so bad that it kills any and ALL potential the concept has earned thus far.-If you're wondering what's so bad about it. For the hour that I got to play, I noticed that the (actual) action gameplay looks alot like that boring ScreenCheat deathmatch style game that I believe EVERYONE got to download for free. Well, the action in this great concept of a game is, depressing to say but sadly; JUST LIKE SCREENCHEAT! OH GOD WHY THE TERRIBLE CLICHE OF CALL OF DUTY DEATHMATCH IN AN EVOLUTION BASED ANIMAL BREADING GAME??! Like F.R., Your animal needs to find a gun and shoot the other player/NPC to death in super repeditive 10-minutes-of-just-straight-respawning action.. I think I speak for everyone that played Screencheat when I say ""Screencheat sucked, Like top 5 worst of all time sucked"".If these are animals then they should fight like animals in gameplay, not like f****ng soldiers in Call Of Duty. to make it more addicting, they should consider an RPG style upgrade/level-up system involving experience points that unlock additional and new ATTACKS (claw/bite/sting/fire breath, etc) and TRAITS (Tolerance to poison based attacks, etc) and paternal/maternal genetic PERKS (example= attacks involving stingers unlocked due to mother being part Wasp, etc..) from breeding 2 of your favorite creations together as a newer stronger animal in Story mode/Online, etc so we can level up our favorite creations and get competitive online or whatever.-maybe add a store or in-game salesmen who you can spend points/money with to buy compatibility-based equipment, armour, and melee style weapons for compatible animals (sword= humanoid animals only, metal claw gloves= four-legged animals only).Those are just some ideas that I am confident gaming consumers (and I myself) would love! -by judging on the common sense of the latest gaming trends such as Fallout 4, or Far Cry or WatchDogs or whatever, I think it would definitely be the coolest route to go about the game. I mean basically every best selling game of late = rpg elements are found alongside the great concepts those games are build on (like fusing the animals to create custom characters here in Hybrid Animals), you just have to look under their huge piles of money to find them lol.I'm just saying, I LOVE THE INDIE GAMES INDUSTRY! I just really don't want to see the one I'm actually pretty excited for *FLOP* like the heavy majority of them.Hopefully you all can turn the con's around from making this game fine with settling at being just another ""okay"" Indie game, to making it a ""GEM"" (THAT I COULD EASILY DROP $15-$20+ -rather than just 6) that I wont have to delete and ask for a refund over later.Thanks for your time-AbstraktDre."

Breeding two animals and making a new one that is never the same if you did it again is crazy, but fun! However, despite the creative idea and the intelligent algorithms, the game is not very optimized for gameplay. You can't choose a custom mouse sensitivity, you can't choose a level of graphics (ex. low, medium, or high), and the FPS feels choppy even if it is high. Also, 9/10 times I try to play, no one is hosting, and no one even bothers trying to host! I sure hope the developer makes ""official"" servers that are always online.The developer says he will make it for optimized for gameplay, and I do hope so. It's a fun idea that is just a joy to play with, but until the game is optimized, I highly suggest waiting!"

76561198074888203,Recommended,448240,23892097,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,OKAMARI NO SUZOKI,"(Please forgive my grammar, I'm not a native English speaker)So, Hybrid Animals. For as long as I remember, I always liked games that let you create. So when I saw this game on YouTube (thank you Game Grumps), I couldn't help but to be amazed by it. So I bought it, I downloaded it and it seems I already spent 12 hours on it.So, I think the best way to start is the core mechanic : merging 2 animals to create a new one. Even in Early Access, the game has a lot to offer : salmon, T-Rex, turtle, bat, ant, etc. You can choose between 57 ""animals"" (I'm using quotation marks because some of them aren't actually animals (looking at you fork, guitar, cheeseburger)) and probably more once the game is out of Early Access. In the end, the hybrids do look pretty good. You can still use previously created hybrids to make new ones, too bad the game forgets about your hybrids as soon as you close it. The fact that stats only last for 24 is a great idea, as it prevents using an overpowered creature over and over.If you aren't satisfied with the roster, you can still create new animals via the Creature Lab. But only if you are patient enough. Most of my time on that game was dedicated to that part, and I only made 2 animals out of it. The interface is not hard to use once you get used to it, but it takes a lot of your time. I feel I could have saved much more time if there was a Copy/Paste button for (a selection of) limbs, a RGB slider for individual limbs, the ability to resize the blocks by clicking on their edge... But that's nothing compared to the animation part, because once you made your little creature, it's time to animate it ! And let me tell you it's the most time-consuming part out of the creating process. I didn't even animate my animals as it was too hard too do. Hopefully the interface will be a bit more user-friendly in the next updates. And by the way, unless you change the folder of the animals you made, you can't use them in Experiment mode.Next is the multiplayer mode, which will soon be renamed ""Rumble Pit"". The modes are a lot of fun with real players, even if it's hard to find games in my time zone. And I have to admit that even if I don't like online shooters (and that I'm not good at them), the idea of my own creature fighting others makes me enjoy these modes. I only wish the bots were a lot easier to kill. They perfectly aim for you, know exactly where you are, and even spawnkill. I hope to play the other minigames seen in the trailer soon !So, even with everything bad I listed here, why do I think it's a good game ? Because it's fun. I like merging 2 animals into a new one, I like using my hybrids to fight others, I like creating new animals. And from what the developer said, I can only get hyped for what's to come : Wilderness mode, Workshop support, more animals, unlockables, map editor, new online modes... There'll be so much to do in th next updates ! If the developer fixes some bugs and makes the interface a bit easier to use, then I'm sure it'll be a great game when it'll finally come out."

,Recommended,448240,22888897,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,The Chaos Kitten,"A fairly fun game, Hybrid animals combines a fun generator with a large selection of different game modes. While I find the creature generation system excedingly fun, with a huge amount of possible combinations as well as custom parent creatures able to be made, I find the gamemodes pretty shallow and lacking. The Deathmatch mode has a DOOM-lite aspect to it, with many creature zipping about the map with powerups and weapons found on the battlefield.  Also, the servers appear to have some problems, with some closing after the game is finished, DCing, etc. Overall, it may be best to wait for the game to be fleshed out further, but if you wish for a variety of games and a fun, more or less unique character creation system, this is a decent game to get. 8.5/10"

The charm of this game obviously comes from the creature creation system and then breeding them together with other creatures. The breeding works perfectly fine, not so much the creation system. I tried making a hot dog creature using this, it feelt clunky not being able to directly drag each piece where I wanted it to be. In addition to that there was no way to actually make any piece of the body symmetrical for some reason, meaning I couldn't create arms or legs (if I had wanted to). Even once I completeled the hot dog I had a major issue with the animation, it kept freaking out even though I edited it frame by frame for those brief frames. It just seems that there is leftover animation that never goes away from the monkey base creature that is given to the character. I thought I could fix this with creating a neutral block piece that was just a white chest base, but there was still a lot of leftover animation somehow"

In the android version you breed 2 animals to get your own, you get a power and you get to wander around, collect resources and build stuff. In this version, it's more multiplayer based, but you get to keep your hybrids.Why would they make the android version different from the PC version? Between the two, the Android version feels better.My recommendation is to play the Android version unless you want to create your own creature and keep that and play with friends.Can I actually recommend this game?Not for PC."

No one plays it you can sit online for a long time waiting for a game. Yes its possible to play with bots but thats kind of boring whats the point of playing alone."

Ive had it for the longest time, it never gets old, endless possibilites, you could even combine them all if you have the patience! I just wished there was more animals, like weasels, bandicoots, lizards etc."

I think that many people who see this game doesn't think it's worth the money and ignores it. I haven't played a lot of the game yet, but i think its pretty good so far."
