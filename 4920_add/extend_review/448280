If you don't have VR you cant play the game.... I myself dont have a VR device, so i had to refund the game.. I wish they would make it more easier to see if its a VR only game etc in the future on steam. Anyways cant really review the game so this is more of an warning to others who dont have VR who want to play this game.edit: They updated store page with a tiny ""vr only"" in the description."

Game has maybe a couple hours of content and only 4 jobs. As soon as i complained about not having enough content on the forums the devs wrongfully banned me. I have asked them for an explanation to my ban and they just ignored it. I refunded it and am only going to buy it if it goes on sale for an actually reasonable price and when the devs start to act like proffesionals and can handle a negative review."

Great for exploring and trying new things for the experienced VR player, and overwhelmingly awesome and easy to play for the first-timer. Everyone who plays VR at my house plays this one over and over. It's one of the truly great VR games on the market right now.I highly recommend this game, and I always will recommend this game. Buy it! You won't be let down, I promise.Highlights: Despite the YouTube community loving the office worker job, my favorites were convenience store clerk and gourmet chef. That being said, office worker and auto mechanic are an absolute blast to play as well."

It is fun for a very short time before becoming boring. I think it's WAY too expensive for what it is. It would be 100% worth it at $10 and probably still a good buy at $15, but paying $30 for this is ridiculous. Wait for it to go on sale or find a friend that has it to try it out before shelling out so much cash.EDIT: In case anyone is wondering, I played all four jobs. I finished the office and convienience store jobs, but was bored of the auto mechanic and chef jobs before completing them. I stand by my review and my opinion of not recommending the game. No replayability. My only regret is not requesting a refund in time."

I played two of the four jobs which barely take around 30 minutes each to complete, and I had seen the other two jobs on Youtube, so I felt like I had pretty much experienced everything. I felt no attraction to replaying the game, and like many other VR games, you complete it too quickly to feel like the price tag was deserving. I can see why this game has such good reviews, seeing as most people received this free with their Vive purchase, but this game is definitely not worth $30. I would highly recommend it if the price was dropped to $15 or $10, which I can see happening in the near future."

I've done everything I wanted to do, at just under 4 hours clocked at time of review. Not much replayability.Only 4 jobs to do, and once you finish storyline for them it leaves you in a ""do what you want"" mode that unfortunately had very little else to do.Take the Diner Chef job for example. When you finish, you can keep playing in the kitchen and make food, but with nobody to serve it to, there isn't much point. During the course of the story I experimented and did everything that came to mind to mess with things. When it ended, having exhausted all the options, why keep playing?The other 3 jobs are the same way.After finishing all 4 jobs, you do unlock some modifiers, but I'd already finished them. Watching other people play is about the only thing left."

,Recommended,448280,28879730,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Yung Idol,"I've seen people complain about the price point of this game which held me back from purchasing the first day I received my Vive. Yesterday after realizing this game was probably not going on sale for Steam's Winter Sale I gave in, and wow am I glad I did.Yes, the core gameisfairly short (I played through all 4 scenarios in about 2 hours), however, the game isEXTREMELYpolished and well done, something that is hard to find for VR right now.Having to shovel through all theMy first Unity game with stock assets and scripts that I'm selling on Steam for $15.00games, loading up Job Simulator and jumping into the Office Worker scenario warmed my heart.I really don't have anything bad to say about this game, so here's some of the reasons I love it:The sounds, visuals and gameplay elements are extremely well done. For example, removing a tire from a car also causes the tire to deflate. You see the air coming out, you see the rubber on the tire shrink ad you feel the haptic feedback of the tire shrinking. You fill a cup up with gas, water, coffee, or whatever. You pour it on your ""face"" and you hear the drinking sounds.To go along with my first point, the attention to detail is astounding. You see things in the scenarios and think ""Surely they didn't think of this"" and yes, they did. You take a cup of water in the Cooking scenario and pour Sriracha sauce and yes, it turns red. You take a headlight in the Auto Repair scenario and pour anti-freeze on it, yes it turns blue. Etc, etc.The voice acting, humor and witty references in the game are great and really make the game.To add to the replayability of the game, once you've finished all 4 scenarios you get add-on cartriges (Think a Game Shark for the old consoles) which can add 3 variables to each scenario, such as low gravity.Overall, this is absolutely one game that every Vive ower should own and even though the main playthrough time IS about 2 hours, that definitely does not make the game overpriced due to the amount of polish that was put into this game. It is worth every penny spent and once you've played it, you will realize this.Great game and I hope this dev is working on something new for VR in 2017!"

Once you've completed it you're done, but I'd assume they are going to add more later.It rewards creativity and hilarity.  I filled someone's cup with Gasoline and Hot Sauce when they asked for a drink, and I gave someone a Pepto Bismol burned hotdog that I dropped on the floor, and enlarged, while visibly scanning it 28 times in front of their face before they gladly paid.GREAT for streamers, as well.

,Recommended,448280,31941192,Posted: 24 May,all,ColeTrain1034,"This was actually one of the first games I ever played on VR at a friends house. Now, a few months later, with my own headset, I've finally played through the whole thing and have a full opinion.I think it's important to note that the only real reason to play this game is for its humor. Yes, the interactivity is fun and creative in many cases, but it's not necessarily a strategic or thought-provoking game. That said, I think it's still totally worth the purchase. If you're willing to put aside expectations and just play this game for what it is, you'll be immersed in a hilarious and creative interpretation of the future, that is excellent at showcasing what VR technology is about to newcomers. I think this is the perfect game to introduce VR to your mom or dad, or inexperienced players.I have to admit, I think some levels were designed and thought through better than others. Maybe it's just due to the sheer length of them, but the auto mechanic and gourmet chef levels caught my interest a bit more than the office worker and store clerk levels. It really just doesn't feel like there's as much to do in the two latter levels.Either way, I definitely recommend getting this game. The replayability is definitely more prevalent than it is in other VR games out now, and there are some extra bonus modes at the end that unlock after you complete all four jobs."

This stands out as an amazing masterpiece... as a tutorial you would see in the store. But absolutely not something you should pay for. There are free VR titles that do the exact same thing, for far less. For example, The Lab from Steam is infinitely more enjoyable and actually has replay value, and it's free.The biggest issue with this, is that it set a precident that most VR games will be this.

Sure, you can interact with the world but you can do nothing to change the scripted experience.  There are 4 game modes each with about 30 mins of game time and no replay value.  I played one of the modes (convenience store clerk) and didn't try any of the others, I didn't have any desire to.As a VR experience I must admit it's pretty good, and it'd be a great demo for stores that sell the Vive, but $30 for 2 hours of scripted gameplay is not worth it, imo.EDIT: I'm changing my review from a ""no"" to a ""yes"", but in actuality it's a ""maybe"".  My kids are really enjoying this game, a lot, no matter how I feel about it.  They're spending more time in each mode than I did, getting up to an hour of playtime from each one.  That still amounts to only about 4 hours of playtime for $30, but that's not much different than any other title I've rated positive so far.However, I am getting tired of spending $20 - $30 for just a few hours of gameplay."

Since as now; hyper-realistic products are continuously missing the mark, because of a reason or another (maybe shooters are the only genre that seems to translate easily in VR), this game/Experience, takes the toon graphic and blocky elements, which can be seen as negative, and make them a positive. You never take yourself serious in this game, and neither does the game.You start in the lobby, where you can choose one of the 4 profession: office worker, food stand worker, mechanic or clerk in a convenience store. Each one is interesting on its own, and they are fundamentally playing differently; although the common elements are there, to give continuity.The graphic is colorful and blocky; so it gives you very little sickness when looking around for some reason. Also it is fast enough to allow you to play at a decent framerate, even on weaker GPU.The sound are awesome and hilarious at time. The robot voices are all monotone and flat, exactly like you would expect from a robot; and the interaction with the oculus controllers is pretty good.Kids love this game; especially because you can do whatever you want while playing; there is no wrongdoing, even if you trash the place or scan 100 times a product for a customer. IT is the ideal game to show to kids and to give to people that never played a VR game; it is guaranteed that they will enjoy it.The game itself is not much of a game; you have tasks; you complete them doing certain actions and move on. You can play each job as many times as you want, starting from the beginning or just loading it and do crazy things; replayability is very limited once you get over the novelty; so you may end up showing it only to people visitng or to kids.The only negative I found is the horrible management of the play space. I had issues to find a decent setup for a week; since for some reasons, the game at launch does not care about your position, even if you reset it; so I end up with the 2 cameras facing me. and when the game launch, I have to face my right. I did try to re-calibrate the sensors, the device, reset the app and everything else you may think... no luck; the view is stuck in whatever the app wants to use.Glad that they did add a ""kids"" mode, so the height of things is reduced, allowing young ones to actually play the game (before I had no luck to see my kids to play the game, since they could not reach the ""tickets"" that start a specific task).Overall, it is an interesting product; won't call it a game, but more like a fun experience; and a time-consuming experience for kids, if you want to keep them busy.

Many people have multiple jobs (e.g., parent, homemaker, and employee). A person can begin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, or becoming a parent. The duration of a job may range from temporary (e.g., hourly odd jobs) to a lifetime (e.g., judges).An activity that requires a person's mental or physical effort is work (as in ""a day's work""). If a person is trained for a certain type of job, they may have a profession. Typically, a job would be a subset of someone's career. The two may differ in that one usually retires from their career, versus resignation or termination from a job."

I recommend playing only one level a night, which will make the game take longer to get through.  After you complete the levels, there isn't much replay value, except to mess around in the jobs.  However, I can see coming back to this game in a year or so and playing again.  Also, it's a great game to show family and friends who aren't gamers, but who want to know what VR is about.  I think Job Simulator would be good for people with children, as it's an easy and fun VR game for them.  It might even be instructive too, helping them to figure out the job tasks and relating them to the real world!"

The fact that the robots often don’t quite grasp how things actually were makes for funny cutscenes.Further, all the jobs contain a lot of loving detail and (to me) unexpected humour. As an example, as a car mechanic, one of your tasks is to sabotage a customer’s car as per SlzBot’s (Sleaze-Bot, your boss) instructions.I spent a few hours in this and haven’t yet explored all jobs there are.

Its literally a job simulator, except you have cartooney graphics, and some robot things talking to you, which by the way never made me laugh or even smile and i find I have a pretty good sense of humor.I have 2 friends play it with me because they were thinking of buying the game, and each of them, once having finished 1 job, ffound no desire to continue playing.Which leads to the reason I dont reccomend this game. The game has no replayability, like, every sequence of the job is the same, and theres really not all that much to the game as it is. Its just pick this up, pull that, put it inside this, turn that etc. The lab has a similar game that is far funner and polished, and its free.If this game was free I would reccomend it, simply as a tech demo, nifty experience that youll play and never touch again, but maybe youll laugh or have a chuckle. But this game is 30 dollars. For 30 dollars you could buy so many better VR games, that you will actually play again, and will make you feel emotion. Hell, there are a handful of games that are better than this and theyre free.In my opinion the most fun you could have with this game is to watch Conan playing it.

76561197978600652,Recommended,448280,28759863,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Hyomoto,"I feel like VR is at a threshold right now.  It feels like we get a lot of Atari 2600-style games, silly 'experiences' and short arcade games, that dominate the landscape.  It's all more expensive than  traditional gaming, both the cost of hardware and short-lifespant of content, and seems easy to largely write it off altogether  right now.  Yet, Job Simulator may be VR experience only as replayable as you can find first-timers to play it: it is THE first-time experience to try—especially if you have Oculus Touch.  It not only teases a better VR future, but also a delicious taste of the type of experience that only VR can provide.To be brief, Job Simulator is a fully physical and up-to-room-scale experience where you pretend to do work poorly.  It's nothing more than a toy, but it's so well polished and chock full of silly interactions that I hope it becomes the hallmark of VR games to come and if you are just trying out VR, there's no better place to start than here.For the record, I originally purchased this on Oculus Home.  My Steam purchase is specifically to see how Oculus Touch works with SteamVR.  The Home version does not seem to support the larger room-scale setups but this one will.  In a way it should be telling I was willing to buy it twice.  Also, Touch support is fantastic in this version, so it also demonstrates that SteamVR can handle those controllers if the developer so chooses."

The jokes poke fun at all-but-too-true quirks of employment with some references to iconic movies/ pop culture on the side. The graphics are easy on the eyes with little to no glitching. The develpers update new content regularly to improve on the working spaces and environment. They added some dance-worthy, humerous music too! As with most VR games, the only thing I would have to say is I wish there was more content."

A tad short but gives a feeling of what VR can do and is a blast to have your friends try out.After about 2 hours of play I feel like I've just about played everything in it. It's not entirely my cup of tea to just goof around but I can see it being great for the younger crowd.Want to throw a slushie at somebody? do it up!Want to cook a crazy meal? Go ahead!
,Recommended,448280,31062743,Posted: 10 April,all,FriendCalledFive,"This would be an easy recommendation if it cost about $15-20 as basically it is a 2 hour experience, so bear that in mind. I bought it for 25% off and it was still too much IMO.It is split into 4 chapters which take about 25 mins each to complete:Office - this is the standout level in the game, it has the most stuff to do, attention to detail and fantastic humour. Easily a 9/10.Restaurant - I enjoyed this one the least, it was the closest to a job that had very forced jokes and excuses for things to do, it could have been a lot better. 5/10.Shop - I quite enjoyed this one, it makes you feel like a naughty kid running a convenience store. 7/10.Garage - This had some neat ideas, but fell a bit short of humour and attention to detail. You do some bad stuff to some cars and it would be nice if the ramifications were seen as the car drives out. 6/10.Overall I liked the game a lot, it is a great VR showcase and I will be showing the office level to my friends, but as a value proposition it leaves a lot to be desired."

It is a great 'tutorial' for VR for both players AND developers.  Certain design concepts, like having real world levers  and buttons combined with impossible machines to save space make for an intuitive and comfortable experience.  Later additions like shorter human mode show that the developers care about all of their users.  I see some reviews stating that this game costs too much, but as a developer myself, I see the love and time that has been poured into this experience. The experience is also full of easter eggs that my kids find more readily than I do. :)"
