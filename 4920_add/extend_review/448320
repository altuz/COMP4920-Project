,Not Recommended,448320,32642103,Posted: 22 June,all,Rakku,Looked great at first with a strong first impression but fell flat after 30 minutes.There's too much struggle with little reward. Progression is shallow and uninteresting.There isn't much to this game as it leaves much to be desired.
,Recommended,448320,31263213,Posted: 20 April,all,Clyde,"Gib me that.I'm not really a big fan of 2D sidescrolling co-op games such as Broforce or Castle Crashers, but this one attracted me the most.Unlike the games above, here I can understand what's happening on the screen when it's full of enemies, and where my character is. I also liked the smoothness of gameplay and overall mechanics.It's a basic horde shooter, but it's a solid one, made with heart, not with corporate greed.What gibes?You got two kinds of dodge jump - Max Payne style and a somersault. Different guns really feel different, although I'd say shotguns are still the most powerful weapons overall.The enemies are standart zombies, with couple of special ones and 6 unique Bosses with different abilities, which are fun to beat.There are also several fun mini-games to farm coins and just relax (except endless Mayhem), which are cool, but the Surfing one gets repetitive really fast.Skill tree has all the essential Perks you might want, and when you're done with that, the Buff tree will open, to invest points in every character's stats. You also have hats and facegear which provide you with various bonuses.The artwork is colorful and enjoyable, the animations are well done. Humour and blood are tied together nicely and aren't distracting.Gib me mooooore!But.There's one major problem with GIBZ right now - it's incredibly short, unfortunately.As soon as you're packed with cool stuff and your character brings hell to every encounter, it ends.It has a complete story, but it's way too short. We beat the game in one sitting, in 3-4 hours, without rushing.So, to sum it up, it's a really fun co-op shoot-em-up for its incredibly low price, it just needs more content.I'll be waiting for a big update to hit, and then I'll gladly replay it again, on higher difficulty.Sorry for those horrible gib puns."

,Not Recommended,448320,31897592,Posted: 22 May,all,SuperJakendo,"I bought this game and gave it a chance by playing it with my cousins and a friend. We played it more or less all the way through, but honestly I don't think reaching the end would really be worth it. We made it to (I think) the final boss but then it glitched out and we couldn't progress. We stopped there and I immediately decided to refund this game.This game feels like a flash game you'd find somewhere on the internet. Seriously everything in this game is just so...lacking and repetitive. The random encounters are annoying, some weapons are CLEARLY better than others, the mini-games are a chore and are boring, and the bosses just drag on and on. At some point all four of us had the automatic rifle and I swear the only thing we heard was non-stop loud gunfire, which was really irritating to the ears. This game is not worth $8 and there are so many other couch co-op games out there that beat this one by a long shot."

Zombies? Here are they. Upgrades? Yeye. Tons of enemies to be killed? Hell, yeah!If you don't want to think, but really want to rest while shooting thousand or two of zombies - this is definetelly your game.And since it's just EA and already so sweet, imagine what can it become.So, deserved 10thousands zombiesof 10.Buy it instantly, don't miss a moment."

You can also change the color of your shirt making it so you can change your look even more. The gameplay is vary arcade fun like and how you get into battles is like pokemon where you go around the world and get in a battle. There are diffrent bad guys other than zombies like chickens werewolfs magggots and more. The games gets sort of hard in the third area which keeps it fun if you want something more hard. The game is a bit short but hey it is early access so you can't blame them. The mini games are great like zombie surfing where you surf on the ground on a zombie which is a great idea and very fun to do. There are some bugs like when you enter out of a area you go to the corner of the map making you walk all the way back but the game is early access so no duh there are some bugs. So I say this game is 10 OUT OF 10 !!!!!!!

,Not Recommended,448320,23197513,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,DaReaper95,"I really wanted to like this game but I just can't.I definitely think it's a great concept, the co-op shooting of zombies in arcade fasion is simple and addictive in principal, and my brother and cousin were more than excited to jump in with me.The bugs I can understand, it's early access. But even with the bugs we beat the content that was there in under 2 hours, and even on hard, it was all pretty simple.Once you've beaten each of the generic and uninspired bosses, you're left with little to do. The ""Minigames"" like Zombiesurfing and Gattling defense aren't very much fun.Zombie surfing plays like a chore, with you trying to avoid boxes on a far too slow moving screen with slightly unresponsive movement controls.Gattling defense has you using a Gattling gun that overheats to hold of waves of zombies, but by the time I figured out how to use it, everything was already killed off by my brother and cousin who were wielding machineguns in their hands.With more guns, a more in depth upgrade system, and more content, I'd be inclined to change my mind, but as the game stands and with the devs calling the game ""Almost finished"" I just can't, in good conscious recommend this to anyone. The idea of it is more satisfying than the experience."
76561198053653124,Recommended,448320,30510814,Posted: 14 March,all,Agrias Oaks,"GIBZ is a fun and user friendly game. It feels similar to Castle Crashers when played with a friend or two! It's truly a joy to play.At the surface GIBZ is a simple game, it feels like something you'd find onNewgrounds.comor other browser based game sites. It is pretty to look at, easy to get into, runs smoothly, and offers a much deeper gameplay than expected. GIBZ is a side scrolling beat'em up. You have a melee weapon, a side arm, and a primary gun.You level up as you play and purchase new upgrades for survivability, melee, mini games, and guns. You can equip hats and facial gear such as glasses, masks, scarfs, etc.. The gear you put on (hats and masks) offer bonus stats, such as bonus side arm damage, faster healing, faster reload speed.As for weapons, there is no real way to know what's better per se. I had 3 or 4 melee weapons 4 side arms, a rifle, an assault rifle, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle. As for the primary weapons (rifle, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle) I noticed a difference in fire rate/fire type. (i.e. Spread on shotgun, rapid fire and poor accuracy on the assault rifle) however, the sniper and the rifle seemed exactly the same to me. Both did reasonable damage, both had great accuracy, both had good range...I actually wasn't able to tell which one was better. As for melee weapons, I had a bat, a board, and a pipe...I didn't know what was different about them. They felt the EXACT same. For side arms, I had a crossbow that fired slow but accurate, a pistol that was semi auto (as fast as I could click), a revolver (also semi automatic), and an uzi (automatic with poor accuracy). I couldn't tell the difference between the revolver or the pistol. There are no stats on the weapons from what I can see, so I didn't see a point in using the revolver over the pistol or vice versa. Same with the melee weapons and the primary. There is no way to know what one is preferred or better.I ended up refunding the game, it simply isn't my cup of tea. However, the game is good for what it is. The price tag is good for what you get. As for replayability, I wouldn't know. As for longevity, I wouldn't know. The multiplayer experience is a blast. Even though I refunded it, I DEFINITELY recommend it, especially if you have a friend or two to play with."

For some reason, the game only launches on Steam Link once. Once you close out, future launches of Gibz on the steam link wind up crashing Steam on the host PC. My second complaint is that it's not clear in the beginning that you have to create the characters before you can assign a controller to them. It would make more sense if you could pick up a controller on a fresh install of the game and say ""create character"" on that controller, rather than having to create the character through the game then assign a controller to it. Aside for this, seems pretty good so far. Props to the dev!"
