There's not even any rhyme or reason as to WHY it could be crashing sometimes; it's just doing it because it has a burning passion for crashing and it's not going to let you or its parents or the town mayor tell it otherwise. It crashes at the start menu. It crashes at the loading screens. It crashes if you try and record it. It crashes when you enter a room. Let me tell you, ifCase #8could crash while it was crashing, it'd be all over that. There are people kept in padded cells and fed on a pole that are more stable than this game.Which is kind of a shame because, honestly,Case #8isn't a horrible game. 'Good' might be stretching it but it's at least average, bundles together a handful of decent scares and is fairly priced. From what I managed to play, there's nothing in the way of combat with the game wheeling out some basic puzzles and item collecting instead as you progress around the prison, gathering the odd piece of scattered lore here and there. It's pasted together in FPS Creator which might well be the source of its problems as this definitely isn't the first time a game from there has been spat out riddled with mystifying bugs.Obviously, I can't recommend something this ridiculously broken at the moment, regardless of the game's quality. It's possible to shoulder your way through a lot of the crashes by reloading or relaunching but I reached a point after the third stage where it refused to pass the loading screen five times in a row and, with the gaming backlog I'm sure we all share, I had to ask myself whether it was worth the strife to persist with it. I settled on a 'no'.Whatever joy I managed to squeeze out of this crashaholic is below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l1PWCaeW3M"

Maybe it'll be fixed in the future.No explanation of controls leading to lots of guessing.No clear explanation (or indication) if a door is locked or needs power or is unlocked.You're a prisoner in an underground prisoner put in isolation. You were sent to prison for murdering your family. I guess you are innocent? You are told all this in some fairly clunky text.Level design looks okay from what little I saw before the crash.I'd wait on this one folks. Maybe the developers will fix it and make it a bit more stable.

76561198007688772,Not Recommended,448350,21933076,"Posted: 19 March, 2016",all,Aargh,"Unplayably broken.At first I wasn't able to run the game at all. After giving the program admin privileges it finally started, showing me immediately the main menu. There's no logo, no title screen, nothing. Weird. And in the menu I've discovered the game doesn't allow you to change anything - not even screen resolution or mouse sensitivity.  That is absolutely unacceptable.The game itself looks surprisingly nice for a low-budget title and the puzzles in the first level were quite entertaining. However, the game keeps crashing, for example when accessing the video terminal. This is pretty bad because it doesn't save your position in the middle of the level so the crash means you have to start over from the beginning.And then I reached the elevator, the game saved... and crashed again. And since then the loaded position crashed every single time, preventing me from ever seeing level 2.It's a shame because the game looked promising. Right now I'm asking for a refund but if the game gets fixed, let me know and I may update the review."

The puzzles are random non-sense and don't always work like they should. I ran into a wall literally, and fell out of the map. The game feels and looks half done and half♥♥♥♥♥made. I have never wanted my money back with any game I didn't like after purchasing but this is the first. Hostel creators or object in the game have large hit boxes and are unnecessarily hard to get past. I just don't like this game...I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. If you do end up buying this game then just don't go over two hours so you can get your money back."

If you ignore that there isn't a lot happening at once, it can be enjoyable. Every puzzle leads to another and you feel so involved in what you're doing and every single time they tried to scare me, they got me off guard! So If you're looking for something to spook you from time to time to keep you on your toes, I suggest this game!"

The game does crash between loading screens and you will need to close and restart game but do not worry it autosaves.  Worth it for a few bucks.Here is a short clip i found on the net:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyA0ZEKqqA&feature=youtu.be
,Not Recommended,448350,23163182,"Posted: 23 May, 2016",all,Torkool,"Honestly the game is kind of interesting, but not really worth the price.The graphics were nice, and the atmosphere was great, but the world still felt blocky, so adding more static objects or something to make it feel real and not square would be awesome. The walking felt really slow, but considering the first part of the game is set in a small area, it makes some sense if they want the game to play a tad longer, but even the running was barely faster than that and felt way too slow for a game. The puzzles I played were pretty bland, lack-luckster, and had been done countless times since the 90's, nothing really special there, although I didn't get the full experience as the game keeps crashing when loading the 2nd area. Sound effects were great, but the lack of music made it awkward. No, not tense, or suspensful. Awkward, and kind of distracting from the whole atmostphere.The writing seems bland, un-motivated, and very simplistic. It's kind of obvious they were going off of nothing here, which isn't inherently bad, but it really didn't have anything special going for it. Bland ""puzzles"", bland writing, no music, and decent at best graphics didn't really give this game much to stand on.Honestly, not a bad game at all, the devs are off to a good start, but it doesn't seem polished yet. I can't say it doesn't feel complete, as I didn't get a chance to finish the game, but the part I HAVE played, the beginning, wasn't very polished, and the beginning is where you want the majority of your polish, since it's the first thing the player gets to experience for your game, and will form A LOT of assumtions and expectations for the rest of your game, so it's important to set that tone and atmosphere correctly, but who knows? Maybe it has better puzzles once you beat the beginning in 10 minutes!Overall has the potential to be a cool game, but right no it's not worth the money unless it's you have some extra steam-cash laying around. I think the developers have potential, FOR SURE! They just need to work on polishing their skills a little more and maybe communicating with others in their field to gather opinions and playtesters to REALLY polish the game and make it a solid $20 experience rather than a half-baked $4 one. Maybe do some more research as to the deep, intricate analysis of video games. Games aren't as simple as just making them, there is A LOT of thought that must go into all aspects of games, and that's something I personally find enjoyable to educate myself about, and is a necessity for any budding game-developer. Good luck to the devs and their future endeavours, and if you decide to buy the game, I hope you can actually load all parts of it!EDIT: As a side note, there are no options in the game either. No brightness, no volume, no resolution, nothing. Just ""New Game"", ""Load Game"", and ""Exit"". Don't expect anything else."

I played your game today for about 40minutes or so and I sadly had to stop playing it and you'll see once my video that I made of your game goes up tomorrow at 4pm on my youtube channel.I'll start of by saying I had mixed feelings about the game. I liked it in someways and disliked it in other ways.Positives :1. Good Scares2. Good ambiance noises3. Nice graphicsNegatives:1. Game crashes after every loading screen.2.There are some glitches in the game where my character cant move.3. I was confused about the laser guns and why nothing was happenig when all of the beams were on? I was wandering for a good 15minutes or so trying to figure out what I was missing and couldnt find anything.4. The character's slow paced walk is too slow for my liking, even pressing the shift button down doesn't make the character go that much quicker.I didn't want a bad experience on this game. infact I was very much extied to try this out and have a good outcome..sadly this didn't happen. I can only be honest with my opinions from the experience I've had. I think personally the game needs more work and the glitche's and crashing needs to be resolved in order for people to have a better experience.If the crashing and the glitches get resolved then yes, I maycome back to this and try again. However, while the game has these issues I cannot recommend it at all."

There are no moments when I thought that maybe this isn’t the right song for this part, and overall, the sound definitely made the experience better.Gameplay: 4/10 - This is just a puzzle game with multiple areas to go through. Obviously, most horror games are going to be like this, but most horror games try to lead the player to the scary situations, whereas this one doesn’t.Atmosphere: 6/10 - The sound really bumped this score up, but also the lighting in the game is phenomenal. It really plays to the idea that there isn’t a lot of power being directed to the prison, so a lot of areas are lit very poorly. Just the combination of the sound and lighting really made it feel scary.Scares: 1/10 - There really aren’t any scares. Simple as that.Do I recommend it? Yes. The game is very enjoyable outside of the regular crashes, and for $4, and 1-2 hours of gameplay is pretty decent."

Still, I am actually impressed with what this developer did with FPS Creator to make this horror game.  While a lot of the game is cheesy, and the scares are nothing but flagrant jump scares, it's still kind of an interesting game to play.  ..It made me want to beat it, but I got stuck near what I believe is the end of the game.  You can watch the above video to see where I got stuck.Keep in mind before you buy it, that it is far from perfect, very far from a AAA game or even a $15 indie horror game.  This is a $4, beat it in a hour or two (with zero replayability) game.  And right now, it's likely to crash when it loads in new sections of the game story and you'll have to restart the game and load it from where it just saved before the crash.Still, for some reason.. I like this game for some reason.  Maybe it feels like the developer wasn't just looking for an easy buck and they put some heart into this little horror adventure game, I dunno.  It's not a masterpiece, and it's nothing to write home about.. but it's interesting and compelling enough, at least to me, to be worth it's asking price."

,Recommended,448350,25358687,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,Xanatos357,"Honestly, I kind of enjoyed this game despite a few minor problems. Reading the other reviews, I expected this game to be barely playable and crash left and right, but to my surprise, it only crashed 3 times for me. I am by no mean giving it a pass for its technical issues. The developer should honestly fix these problems, but the chances of that seem highly unlikely at this point. I will say that the game only seemed to crash when loading between levels, so it wasn't that bad because I didn't lose any progress, but it was an annoyance.Now let's get to the actual game. You are prisoner #8 who was imprisoned for murdering his family and when your cell door opens mysteriously, your goal is to now escape. Your prison seems to be abandoned with the exception of some creature things that pop up in jump scares. There is no combat in the game, but there are a few sequences that can instant kill you and make you restart the entire level since there is no checkpointing. This was only a problem for me in one level where I kept dying to the""master hand""and had to replay the same part three times.Summary-Overall, the game did have a creepy atmosphere and some of the scares really did get to          me.-Decent Atmosphere and the scares were pretty good; some were kind of predictable.-The game looks decent, graphics-wise, though there does seem to be a bright shine off of  some of the environment which did obstruct my view on one of the lockpicking mini games.-The game is $3, and I beat it in a little under an hour, so I'll let you decide if that's worth it or not-Don't expect too much from the story, it's present, but doesn't add much. Though I should note the the game ends saying ""To be continued"", so I don't know if there is another part coming or not.-Some technical problems, including the punctual crash that always happens loading between levels"
