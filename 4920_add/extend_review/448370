,Recommended,448370,22519307,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,b0rk3d [GB],"This game is actually very fun. It's a chaotic shooter that doesn't take it's self too seriously. If you enjoy mindlessly blowing things up and killing folks as they run towards your MG fire, this game is undoubtedly for you. It reminds me very much of some of the older arcade games I used to play, which adds a nice nostalgia value. It has a skill tree to follow and that is basically the key to your long term survival in game, it adds some replayablitiy but im sure it will get old when complete.As for the people whinging because you're killing islamic state fighters in a fictional future setting, who cares? It could be any historical or fictional enemy running towards you and it wouldn't detract from the fun.For £5.50 (or cheaper in the sales) this game is great and in my opinion worth every penny."

,Recommended,448370,22521607,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,Chubzdoomer,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ03EudTMQwIS Defense is a modern take on the old Beach Head games that were popular in arcades all around the world.  The premise is simple:  Man an MG nest and destroy everything that comes your way.  You have two weapons at your disposal--an MG and a rocket launcher--and numerous support abilities, ranging from supply drops to air strikes, that you can activate once you've attained enough kills.Although the gameplay is rather simplistic, it's also highly replayable.  There are several ""hooks"" to keep you coming back like persistent skill trees, unlockable levels, leaderboards, and end-level statistics that show how many enemies you've killed, vehicles you've destroyed, and whether or not you survived longer than your previous best time.Graphically, IS Defense is pretty impressive.  Thanks to epic explosions and ragdoll physics, blowing up incoming landing craft and technical trucks never gets old.  There are also lots of graphics options to tweak, including a much-needed FOV slider.  Best of all, the game performs quite well on my rig even in the later stages of invasions in which all hell is breaking loose (i7 4700, 8 GB RAM, GTX 970).Overall, if you're looking for a simple, yet fun shooter chock full of explosions and carnage, IS Defense is a no-brainer for 8 bucks.  If you enjoyed the Beach Head games, I'd go as far as to say it's a must-buy."

A generation ago, this would have been a coin-op game. No, it does not have overly sophisticated graphics or anything; it just delivers on its premise, offering a few minutes of pure mayhem when you have a half hour of downtime to spare.The only thing everyone obsesses on is the fact that the enemies are IS (aka ISIS or Daesh). I do not understand why this is controversial. If this same game had Nazis as enemies instead, it would have had zero controversy. Hundreds of games (and movies) feature Nazis as convenient, easily disposed of cannonfodder that the heroes may slaughter without guilt. Why is it different with IS, when these guys are equally as irredeemablly evil as the Waffen SS? You are tasked with holding off the worst of the worst of the worst that humanity currently has to offer. There is literally no force on earth more evil than ISIS at this time, is there?

,Recommended,448370,22768675,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,EdenStarGazer,"An intensive shooter in stationary locales that takes current events into the realm of tomorrow’s newspapers; IS Defense is a mesmerizing bullet arcade.The music is fantastic and adrenaline charging. Add to that the sound effects and voices of enemy terrorists and you are sure to find this game something you will come back for more and more. The opening movie is laced with video & news shorts from today’s news, and weaves out the projected path of IS threat in the European world. It really makes you think about what is happening around you.I’ve only had the game a short time, but since many are interested in this game, I wanted to do the review now and lend support to this awesome game. The graphics are great. The premise is simple enough. And, the firepower is great! The card art is something worth collecting as well.I often say I’m not into fps games, though shooting is something that I can do fairly decently in games. I just normally don’t enjoy heavy combat elements. This one is intense, and you are stationary, making it probably more intensive, as far as fire power goes. You literally mow the waves of incoming enemies down as the suicide bombers attempt to reach you. With the perfect defensive position, your job is to shoot and reload. That’s it. The first level has you on the beach, as waves of pontoon boats are followed by ships with pickups. They all attempt to land a force on the beach and sweep past you. You hear the screams of the terrorists as they wage what they see as a “holy war.” And, you are reminded that war is not always a choice.The game reminds me of the words of George Orwell, “People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.” If you are like me, you don’t like blaming a group of people nor a religion, nor other non-germane causes for the evil that takes place. But, the IS is not a religion. It is a terrorist group that is as much a problem for the Muslim community as for the rest of the world. If you don’t see the difference between IS and the Islamic faith, then this game may not be for you. Another word of caution; the shooting is intensive. I usually need frequent breaks when playing shooters like this.The game is simple, straightforward, and offers many leveling up rewards for the gamer who likes “bullet-hell” type games. The main difference is you are behind the bullets for much of the game.I recommend IS Defense for teens and adults interested in current world events and defending their homeland from terrorists."

The ragdoll and where you shoot people and how it affects them is spot on, I have my body count turned to unlimited and vehicles destroyed all stay there, it creates a real battlefield, which I think is nice. The graphics are really good for a $5 game, its an arcade style shooter as many have said. The upgrades help, but even then the game is still challenging. Blasting away waves of terrorists till you get overwhelmed. The terrorists act smartly (sometimes). What I mean by this is if you have shot the people out of a vehicle, other troops will try to man the turret or the driver seat and use it against you, instead of leaving it a husk. You can cause damage to buildings when you upgrade your MG. When you shoot at hummers, the gunner never dies unless the vehicle blows up, that is my main issue with this game TRUST ME ITS ANNOYING AS HELL AND DOESN'T QUITE MAKE SENSE, other than that, its well made, the AI has some brains, though sometimes your soldiers will be standing in a line and get plowed by an enemy truck like a bunch of idiots, or run and cover next to a flaming vehicle.

The game has more depth than I expected (you have to time your calls for supply / health drops and infantry support if you want to survive and you get promotion points to upgrade your health, weapons or support options).The graphics are fantastic (game is running on the Unreal Engine) so killing those barbaric goat loving Islamic State imbeciles never felt and looked as good as in IS Defense. As a bonus sometimes the slow motion bullet-time effect activates. Same goes for the audio: it's loud, raw and has a lot of umpf and makes the situation you find yourself in far more intense!IS Defense is not an expensive game (around € 5), there are only 4 maps in the base game,  however it's so much fun a DLC and/or more maps and scenarios would be most welcome, especially since the game comes with support for MODs!If you like the On-Rails Shooter genre this game is an absolute must have!10/10 stars.

And a million times: YES!Delivered by the developers of the probably most controversial game ""Hatred"" comes their newest work: IS Defense.So what is it about? In case you haven't noticed already, the game is set in a unreal (yet scaringly possible) future where ISIS has taken over north Africa and is starting an offensive against Europe. Your job is to stop them, one Bullet at a time...(TL;DR in the end)First things first, I don't like rail shooters. I don't like them at all. But this game does not feel like a rail shooter, more like a first-person tower defense, and it's totally AWESOME!PLOT:Your only task in the game is to pop some Jihadists. How? It's up to you.Unlike other railshooters (even though I won't count IS Defense as one) you don't just click with your cursor across the screen, instead you're placed on a stationary fortificated hill with a Machine gun (unlimited ammo, but magazine size of 200 shots) and a Bazooka (you start with 6 shots, you get more via supply drops, I'll get to them later), which can turn around 360 degrees.Along with your weapons, you are given a variety of point streaks (Supply drop, Infantry support, Artillery support, Air support and Helicopter support). They are all feeding from the same score pool, that means if you call in a support, you will maybe not be able to call in a different one.While you're mowing down the islamist invaders, you gain XP, which gives your character level ups. At each level up you get one point, which can be spent in your skill tree (4 branches: Player, Machine gun, Rockets, support), which works like most other skill trees (get the lower skills to unlock higher ones, the higher ones cost more points).MAPS:The game is really hard in the beginning, but the more games you play, the stronger your character gets, the easier the game gets. Then you unlock the next map, which is harder and requires you to rank up higher to beat it etc.I've only played the first 2 maps yet and I have to say that the developers did great work with them. I was expecting the maps to be the same with just a different look, but they aren't. While the first map is an open beach, the second map is a harbor. Where the first map was feeling hard first because of the wide field the enemies were approaching from, you will miss this wide open field in the second map. The enemies rush out of several buildings, stand on the roofs and rush around the corner with their armored cars (yes, they don't just have Toyotas with Machine guns).ENEMIES:The enemies vary from regular infantry, infantry with rocket launchers, suicide bombers, Toyotas and armored cars (at least I have seen so far)Watch out for the suicide bombers tho. They're easy to spot (red clothing, suicide belt and running directly at you without a gun continously shouting in Arabic) as long as all is chilled, but when the whole screen is full of enemies, you suddenly see a Kebab infront of your face and the game is over. Regular infantry will also throw grenades when they come close to you and run away when they're on fire. The enemy vehicles try to (and WILL) run over your infantry, watch out for them. When you shoot the driver of a Toyota while the car is in motion, the car will go loose, may run over people, crash into a building, drive into the ocean and die or just turn in circles until it explodes from the fire.All in all, the AI is perfect.POINT STREAKS:Supply drops: A dropship will drop a crate with either health or rockets into the combat zone. Shoot the crate to get it. Upgrades increase the crate number or the contents itself (like 100% health regen).My suggestion: stockpile your crates so you can shoot the health boxes when you need them instead of calling a drop when you're low at health and die.Infantry support: My favourite one so far. This steak calls in a group of friendly soldiers (marked with a blue diamond) to fight the enemies. Not only do they help you get more kills, they also distract the enimes from you, giving you more time to fight more enemies, reload, etc.My suggestion: Use as much as possible.Artillery support: Covers the combat zone with Artillery. Impacts are random and they might (and WILL) hit your allies too. Also the standard one is really short.My suggestion: Upgrade to the longer lasting artillery and when you use it, call in the infantry after the shelling is over.Air support: Call in jets that nuke (not really) the combat zone. More effective but more expensive than artillery.My suggestion: Use it when you can affort it.Helicopter support: Calls in an attack helicopter that attacks anything hostile on the combat zone. Destroys Toyotas in the blink of a second and really takes some weight off your shoulders.My suggestion: Use it when there's heavy enemy activity.GRAPHICS/AMBIENTThe graphics are great, as you would expect it from a 2016 game. The game is running great on High-Ultra settings for me, only having massive lags sometimes when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan but it only lasts a short moment and continues fluently afterwards.The explosions are realistic, shells are flying across the screen, blood, gore and corpses everywhere (you can set the body count in the options, I suggest ""unlimited"" for the ultimae Kebab removal experience. The vehicles behave very realistic (like stated in the ""enemies"" section). The game is really packing and you wil feel the adrenaline rush through your body while you're defending Europe from the terrorist invaders.MODSI tested no mods so far because the mod support just came in, but I expect some great stuff from you guys.TL;DRThis is the ultimate fast-paced first-person kebab remover game in the world. Get it. GET IT NOW!"

So great fun.I did have some problems with the realism though.  For a start, none of the enemy shout ""Allan's Snackbar!"" as they advance.Secondly, the enemy did not run away when faced with armed opposition.  That is normally what happens with this particular enemy.  They are only brave when up against civilians, children, hostages, and unarmed soldiers who are tied up.  When they see anyone else they flee in terror.It would have added extra realism if, not only did they flee, but they dressed up (badly) as women, being too dim to work out that women don't have beards and their disguise is fooling nobody.Apart from that it's great fun and I recommend it."

I never played it until today because frankly I wasn't expecting much.I was wrong.This game is actually pretty damn good. Obviously it's not an in-depth immersive experience but for what it is it is genuinely a hell of a lot of fun. The skill tree and special abilities really make the gameplay more involved than just 'aim-shoot-repeat'. Some of the abilities are milestones that make the game 10x easier (increased fire rate, no reload etc.). Personally I find it a shame that they allowed 360 movement to become unlocked as it kind of removes the entire Q/E yaw functionality but it does allow for more brutal, fast-paced meat-grinding which is pretty much this game's selling point.While I would have liked some humor in the mix to spice up the enjoyment factor, for example suicide bombers shouting ""Allahu akbar!"" as they ran at you, I understand that this may have wound up with some offended parties.All in all a surprising little gem that delivers some solid fun while not trying to be anything more than it is.

Runs pretty well while looking pretty good and comes with a decent amount of replayabilty even before the built in modding capabilties.Writing a review before the inevitable ♥♥♥♥♥torm some of the game media website are bound to stur up.Its obvious the dev team choose what on the outside looking in would be a 'controversial' topic. Thing is ISIS is a ♥♥♥♥ing abhorrent terrorist organization and perhaps the most pressing threat to the first world/western civilization making them an obvious antagonistic force not just off their own 'power' or ability but much of the sympathy they seem to be getting from people within the very nations they would sooner see burned to the ground. If media outlets are shilling this game out as racist or islamaphobic just remember that nearly 10 years back CoD4 did about the same thing over the course of its campaign and is still lauded as perhaps the last 'good' call of duty.The game plays well, for a 5 dollar game on steam you could definitely get much worse, less polished, and typically perpetually stuck in 'early access' game. Compared to those IS defense is a godsend.Its a waved based survival ""rail shooter"" stressing the rail of course as you never actually move from your spot however you do pivot in a full 360 degree area most of the action dealing with the front line and usually needing the pivot for flanks within the game to deal with enemies behind you. I havent yet gotten too far in but while you'll tend to die pretty quickly the game is clearly about getting your skill trees upgraded in order to progress further.The visuals considering what the game is and how much its costs are incredibly obviously not The BEST™ but are pretty goddamn good something that combined with the gameplay within leaves me hoping they manage in some VR integration in the future or a VR rerelease perhaps if I indulge in the VR wave in the future I'd pick this is up again in a heart beat.All in all you get a really good Game for Buck ratio you get three stages to progress through and built in Mod support so if the modding scene takes off even a little bit the game will likely have more replayability then it has any reasonable right to have as a $8 game."

After a certain amount of kills, you gain a skill point to invest into a progressive skill tree that will remain upgraded for your future runs. There are only 4 maps in the entire game that are locked from play until you reach a certain amount of total kills for that specific map. I noticed that there is a workshop for this game, but ever since launch, there is only one entry on the workshop with no additional entries from anybody else so basically it's like the workshop doesn't exist. Is it any good? Yeah, it's pretty good as one of those games where if you're having a bad day for whatever reason, you can boot this up and just have a blast, kind of like how games like Stardew Valley or Slime Ranchers relieves some stress I had prior to playing a session, only IS Defense is a more violent alternative.Now get out there, mount that LMG, shoot some terrorists, and most importantly, make Lord Tachanka proud. {-}7"

Germans, Russians, Koreans, whatever enemy the US has at any given moment are usually fair game in, uh, games.What we have here is basically an arcade shooter. It is a sort of tower defense where you act as a lone tower with a few abilities at your command, as well as an RPG element with a talent tree that will help health regeneration, give troops more health, and more rocket ammo. There’s a lot more but that’s just an example.You start with a beach level where you have to kill 2,000 terrorists. Sounds like a lot, and I died only 300 enemies in… the first time. Turns out all the experience and talents you earn are cumulative. When I ‘failed’ the second time It added my ~700 kills to the previous 300 and then I was at ~1000 or so into unlocking the second map.You have several weapons in your arsenal including five different active abilities that “Charge up” as you kill enemies. The level 1 is a supply drop and the level 2 summons a few ground troops that I find are actually extremely helpful. After summoning about three groups of them I pushed fairly far into one game.I will admit, the game feels good. I can understand how some people may find it boring but I find the explosions satisfying and I like watching the evolution from a peaceful beachfront to a horrifying warzone.The game has more depth than readily apparent. There’s a sort of resource management to a degree. The skills you get work in tiers. For example, if I used the Tier 3 ability (Artillery bombardment), That bar would tank down to the first tier ability (The supply drop). The more you save, the more powerful supports you receive, culminating on an attack chopper that sticks around for a couple minutes to give you some much needed breathing room.And the supply drops don’t go away when they drop, you have to shoot the large boxes to benefit from them. So if the support drops a health, you can leave it there for emergencies. So you have to balance your support out; Sometimes I call for a supply drop but don’t do anything with the health boxes it drops until later on.You also have to worry about suicide bombers so you can’t just ignore all the ground troopers and focus on vehicles.The whole game is a unique balancing act of quick decision making “Should I do this… or this?” This is impressive for very simple mechanics.Not something you’d spend all day on but it’s a neat little sprint to see just how far you can get, and if you can beat your last high score (Which you probably can considering you probably have a couple new skills in your arsenal)."

You also have a skill tree allowing you to upgrade and cause even more carnage. This is an arcade classic with a bit of a new twist and pretty decent graphics.Now for the political part.

No different than say if they made it defending new york from a nazi invasion or Red Dawn as a turret defense.If you really want to ignore this fun game and rally for its removal because you think being against ISIS is racist or islamaphobic then you should also rally for the KKK and Nazi symbolism to be socially accepteptable.Long story short this is a fun game, no matter who the enemy is.

You get endless waves of enemies until you die, but it gets easier or at least to where you can live longer without dieing as you unlock talent/skill point abilities. For instance, i only was able to kill 50 terrorists before being over run when starting out, about an hour later I was killing 200-300, right now i'm killing 700-1000s at a time without dieing.There are fully destructable environments, you can shoot anything and destroy it, vehicles, walls, everything. It's pretty amazing for the price, the graphics are pretty good, I give it a 10/10 for the price. Glad I picked this one up, it's really fun. I almost gave up on it in the first hour because like I said it was too hard and I felt like an idiot dying so easily, but I realize there's no way to really win, it's endless waves and you'll be over run eventually they dont run out of terrorists, but lasting longer made it fun, it gets utterly chaotic at about 6-7 minutes in, everything destroyed, you can't even tell what's going on hardly anymore how cluttered the screen is how many explosions are going on, it's amazing fun.

,Recommended,448370,22536459,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,{PK} LOGiK,"It's short, longer than the amount of time I'd like to spend on a date prior to going back to the bedroom though and certainly cheaper than said date which is great.It's simple, not in a bad way, similar to the kind of girl you meet in a bar who has a few badly done tattoos that are just visible enough to prevent her from getting a job without being sufficient for her to be an alternative model - she's a simple girl but that's what you want in that situation.It's fun, really fun. Great stress relief. Much like the result of meeting that girl in a bar but with violence as the fun instead of bedroom entertainment. Again, while it's short, it also lasts longer than I do in the bedroom and I don't have to deal with waking up thinking ""what the ♥♥♥♥ did I do last night"" afterwards.So onto a better review (skip to the bottom if you just want pros and cons). You can forget there being a storyline at all. You're a big♥♥♥♥♥machine gun with unlimited ammo (though you have to reload until you unlock the chain feed skill) and you have to mow down things attacking you, you also have a rocket launcher attached but this has limited ammo, the machine gun does not. These things attacking are infantymen, trucks and humvees which can attack from 360 degrees and have a range of armour values (the humvees being the most heavily armoured, infantry having no armour and die with a single bullet as far as I can tell). There are 3 maps which can be viewed as easy, medium and hard. The difficulty level is not linear, the second map is a little more challenging than the first, the third map is immensely more challenging than the second.The enemy design is pretty basic, the humvees look like stolen US military ones, the white trucks look like the beat up toyotas you might find on the sands of the middle East. I do like the touch of them flying IS flags, it's nice to be mowing down hundreds of enemies and feel like you're doing the world some good. There are also small boats and large transporters which carry enemies and can be destroyed prior to landing, though the transporters require 2 or 3 rockets for destruction (but they carry around 6 soldiers and 1 or 2 vehicles)The graphics are surprisingly nice, solid framerate too, I guess Unreal 3 is to thank for that. The level designs are pretty good, fair. I like the second map the most as it's a good mix between open areas and covered corners that the enemy can attack from. The first map is far too open and gives a lot of chance to destroy enemies before they can attack you as it's a beach and the third map is a little chaotic as enemies seem to come from literally everywhere and have cover until they are relatively close.There are a series of skills to unlock. You can make the gun more powerful and accurate, you can make your rockets more powerful, you can boost your survivability/health and you can increase your ""assistance"" power. The assistance is a perk system where within each map you earn experience that can be spent on CPU help in the form of:supply drops; health crates and rocket crates,infanty support; a group of soldiers who shoot at the enemy with you,artillery support; random sustained explosions knocking out enemies around you for a while,air support; a group of jets bomb the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the map andhelicopter support; a chopper hovers around the map shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥for you.The downside is, the difficulty level seems to be tied to the number of skills you have unlocked and to how many forms of assistance you request in each map, or maybe it's simply rated against the XP you're earning in the map. I might be wrong on this but I lasted longest when I had fewest unlocks though.I also found that the rocket launcher is a bit of a gimmick, due to the limited ammo and my resistance to wasting experience points on supply crates, I found I didn't use it much as the actual power of the rockets is negligible compared to the fully upgraded gun.It would be far improved by the rockets slowly respawning as you play every 30 seconds or so rather than requiring supply crates, or even having that as one of the skill options.The CPU support also kills the infantry you request when using artillery or airstrikes, to the point some airstikes wipe out all my infantry. Helicopters do not stack, you can only have one at a time. Infantry does stack, but I'm not sure what the limit is. The infantry also tends to run very far out and it's easy to mow them down with enemies once they've expanded away from your area too much. This can be pretty annoying as by 2-3 minutes in each map, CPU support becomes necessary. The helicopter and airstrikes can save your♥♥♥♥♥ while the infantry often take a lot of the heat off you by eliminating the smaller targets.You can unlock all the improvements and defeat the map challenges (certain kills and vehicle kills per map) within about 3.5 hours. Considering the game costs as much as about 2 beers here which might last 1 hour at a push with a bunch of friends talking rather than drinking, I'd say that equates to pretty damn good value for money! I'm 4.4 hours in as of writing this and I've killed 16000 enemies - there's an achievement for 30000 which looks like it might be the most difficult achievement in game, along side the last 20 minutes on each map - I think my top survival is about 11 or 12m.So:Pros:+Explosions+Killing Terrorists+Stress Relief+Surprisingly good graphics for the money (thanks, Unreal 3)+Entertainment+Value for money (playtime vs cost)Cons:-Only 3 maps-Not much replay value outside of stress relief-Inability to turn off improvements once unlocked despite increasing difficulty-Unpredictable and non-linear increase in difficulty level during play-Fairly short gametime before ""completion""Summary:Buy it, it's cheap and fun, you wont regret it. There's also a potential for mods in the future (hopefully more maps) so that should extend it some in the end!"

They are great platform to either fully utilize a good idea or even tell a rolling story. The latter would be Blue Estate. That uses the rails to progress the story and uses camera angles and movements to challenge the player. The former - the use of this as a platform to build a simple-form game around - like IS Defense, is very easy to get wrong. Everyone who plays an on-rails shooter always thinks ""I could make this"". No you cant. Your ideas are probably terrible. IS Defense has a very simple ""active"" tasks setup. You shoot, call in infantry, supplies, air strikes, et al. But its done in a progression system so you need to use certain tactics sparingly and at the right times. Under the action is a character upgrade system that is simple; Upgrades are noticeably helpful upon re-entering the game. If you dont buy this game then you love ISIS.

,Recommended,448370,35363184,Posted: 30 September,all,SockDog,"Firstly, let's forget the theme. You're going to be mowing down digital humans for fun, it's hardly important what clothes they're wearing so chill your triggers.Secondly, it's a puddle deep turret shooter with some progressive persistent unlocks. So enter only those who want a violent alternative to minesweeper.That said lets get onto some observations.The persistent unlocks offer something to strive for, of course that also means once you've unlocked some of the juicier items you're left chasing scores and leaderboard positions. These do highlight your friends which is kind of neat but you can only see this while playing, can't see an option to do it from the menu which is a bit odd.As the developer of Hatred I did expect a bit more gore but alas you'll need to settle for some nice explosion effects. Reality is you'll rarely see or have time to appreciate any of the human/bullet relationship detail.Grind. Each map unlocks after achieving a cumulative enemy and vehicle kill target. This means you'll be playing the same map many times before you can move onto similar gameplay over a new canvas. The lack of variety therefore is a bit of a negative, the positive being you're not going to see all the maps in less than 4 hours and well you'll be earning xp to unlock those persistent skill upgrades.As noted by other reviewers, some of those upgrades remove a lot of the hinderances the game starts off with such as needing to reload or operate the rotation of the turret via keys. Judge yourself whether you feel this sucks although it should be said you don't have to upgrade those skills (but you can't deactivate one you've purchased!).Levels play out randomly which can impact your run and I question to some degree how leaderboards would be totally reflective of people's skill when RNG could influence the result but bah, it's a silly game so why worry about that.An annoyance I found most impacting of my fun was the attacks from the sides. While it's neat you are forced to change your focus to a new area of the maps it's also often done while you're also being attacked from the front. There are some support powers you could call in at this time but it again leaves you somewhat open to RNG on how much damage you'll be unable to avoid.On the whole. I'd reccommend this if you want some dumb brainless fun with some challenge (and a sprinkle of RNG). Workshop support is in there (although I see only two entries as of writing) so there may be some additional longevity or at least eye candy in the future. Get it cheap and I think this is a good one for a quick blast now and again."

,Recommended,448370,33073016,Posted: 1 July,all,RaNgeR,"A simple, action-packed, stationary-FPS,IS Defenseis all about destroying waves of ISIS fighters. Why? Because who gives a flying f**k about ISIS anyways? :DHere is my review for the game:BackgroundYou operate a stationary position armed with a machine gun and a rocket launcher. Your mission is simple: Defending your position from endless waves of ISIS fighters, attacking you with ground troops (suicide bombersincluded), fast-attack vehicles armed with machine guns, as well as Zodiac boats and landing crafts which deploy enemies in missions with beachheads.While defending your position, continuously killing enemies grants you Skill Points, with them you can upgrade you skills, from weapons to reinforcements and fire support.Also, you get the option to call in 5 different assets:1.Cargo Plane [b/] - a C-130 randomly drops 2 crates of either extra health or extra rockets, sometimes both of them.2.Infantry Support- a squad of 8 riflemen to assist you with the fighting. You can call the infantry squads as many times as you like. Friendly fire is on, so don't kill your own guys :P3.Artillery- fire mission of artillery shells dropping on the battlefield for a short period of time.4.Airstrike- ultimately the best asset against large presence of enemies which you can't fend off, a group of 3 F-16s will drop bombs across the battlefield.5.Attack Helicopter- an Apache attack helicopter is deployed above the battlefield, killing the enemies from anywhere they come.The game includes 4 missions with each one is unlocked by killing a specific amount of ground troops and vehicles in the previous mission in order to advance.The GoodIf you really want some anger relief, this is one of the games that actually does that. With the amount of endless action and enemy waves, also being ISIS... Just sit back, relax, have a cold drink, a snack, and never raise your finger from the fire button.The NeutralWhile the game is described by the developers as a side-project, don't expect to get aCall of Duty-style fast-paced gameplay or a NASA-super-computer graphics and effects. Though released in 2016, the graphics and special effects are mediocre, but not alarming enough to make you regret it. It's not the graphics that you should worry about!The BadWhile I really like this game, after buying it during the Steam Summer Sale in -50% for just 2.99$, I played for about 3.5 hours straight and completed every mission and unlocking every upgrade. The game is relatively short, also not very much challenging as soon as you completely upgrade you skills.Something else that disappointing me is the minimally variety of enemies to kill. No, I didn't expect a building-sized MECHs, but maybe some tanks, APCs, etc. Your own support is also minimally attractive. After calling-in the infantry squads a few times, I expected to get also some friendly vehicles to add a little more taste to the battlefield. The helicopter wasn't enough for me, to be honest... :(The game would also be great if it had cooperative feature. What is better than killing ISIS with your friends?Final Verdict Score:7.5/10Personally I wasn't disappointedentirelyfrom the game. I will keep playing it, as well as recommend it to other people.

The maps become harder as you go.Edit: Took me about 5-6 hours to get ""game completed"" and all unlocks.

I had the same reaction as most people when this game was announced, why make a game out of the ****ty turret section that most people hate in shooters?  Well, if the turret sections in shooters were anywhere near as good as this, maybe most people wouldn't hate them?  This is just mindless killing fun and what boils down to survival mode (you're eventually going to get overwhelmed, it's a matter of surviving as long as you can and killing as many enemies as possible), but it's executed really well.  You're in a motorized turret that can turn 360 degrees.  Wave after wave of terrorists are coming at you and you mow them down.  You have a machine gun and a rocket launcher.  you gain experience and can spend skill points for upgrades (faster moving bullets, incendiary rockets, more health, etc.)  You can call in supply drops, infantry help, artilery support, air strikes, an helicopter support.It's a simple game that's well executed and a good bit of fun.

An on-rails wave survival  turret shooter.---- Plot ----In a politically-fictional setting, the year is 2020, ISIS controls all of the Middle East and the North African region through their conquest of world domination. They're next major step? The invasion of Europe.You are put into the boots of a NATO stationary machine-gun operator whose task is to stop the assault by any means given.---- Weapons and Skills ----You're only given two weapons here, a M240 Bravo (at least I think it is) and a rocket launcher. At first starting out, your weapons are fairly weak. Over time, when you start leveling and gaining skill points, your two weapons can take out ememies and vehicles with ease with the upgrades you can earn.With skills points you can make your MG shoot faster and deal damage harder, etc. Give your rockets the option to shoot incendiary rockets, bigger blast radius, reload faster, etc. Better support help like ""Special Forces"" which gives your infantry more health, make your chopper fire rockets. There are quite a bit of skills to put to use here.---- Enemies ----ISIS, duh, but in three varieties. Basic rifleman that will shoot at you. Suiciders that will rush your pillbox in an attempt to kill you. Technicals and stolen Hummvees with LMGs on them that deal little damage if you tackle one. In pairs or more, they'll shred your health if you not careful.---- Support ----Supply Drops - refills your health or rocketsInfantry - helps handle ground targetsArtillery Shelling - handles ground and vehicle targetsAirstrikes (my favorite) - drops bomb payloads onto ground targets and vehicle targets like artillery, but more damageand lastly, Chopper - does everything the others can do.Each one can be upgraded in some way with skill points earned.---- Overall ----This game reminds me of Boom Beach, and other rail shooters. Great game to spend time playing to see how far you can last against wave upon wave of fighters. If you unlock all the skills and plan accordingly, you'll be almost unkillable. This game was a side project for the devs and lasts maybe 2-3 hours ..ish and for $8. All in all, I had fun and some memories of the old rail shooters I've played."

But the game looks pretty/runs great on my machine, the reinforcement/support system is nice, and blowing up the little boats is REALLY satisfying. My advice is upgrade your machine gun as it makes the game way more fun when you a) don't have to reload every five seconds and b) can actually blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of things instead of pouring ammo into a truck and waiting years for it to finally blow up.8/10, simple game without much variety but really, really fun.P.S. I guess some people could view this game as offensive. But it's not like you're mowing down innocent Muslims and the game is telling you that Muslims are bad or something. The game makes it very clear that you're fighting ISIS only and if you think it's offensive to make a game about mowing down ISIS terrorists I think you need to adjust your definition of ""offensive.""

Worth more than a similarly priced fast food combo meal.It's a simple yet challenging static defense game, which plays like it belongs in an old school arcade.  No, it's not a rail shooter.  This train ain't going anywhere unfortunately.Pros:Kill Islamic State.  'nuff said.Pretty graphics, lots of fire and explosions.  The smoke, mist, and vegetation obscuring the battlefield give it a realistic feel that makes you question if the daeshbags are coming.  (get UAV skill to end this problem)Gets challenging and strategic.  You have to deal with flanking attacks, and balance your supply, infantry, artillery, airstrike, and chopper support.  Decisions have to be made very quickly.The real time leaders board that updates as you play.  Good call.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cons:Too short.  There's only three levels.AI is stooopid, even considering that they're daeshbags.  Drivers will run over their own infantry, and crash into things.  Vehicles don't move intelligently, they seem to just follow a set path and smash through anything in the way.  Enemy and friendly infantry make no use of cover and concealment or even keeping one's head down.There's only a few enemy types I've seen so far.  Infantry, suicide bombers, trucks, humvees, and the three different landing boats.  When you play your first game you'll see all of them.  Nothing new to see through game progression except the two other maps.Debris piles up and clutters the battlefield pretty badly.  This is a good feature sometimes, but annoying when an enemy truck parks behind a pile of blown up vehicles and can't be hit.  Also messes with enemy vehicle pathing.  It looks silly when infantry are standing on top of a wrecked truck engulfed in flames and don't even notice.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Wishlist:More maps.More enemy types.  Tanks, rocketeers, car bombs, armored personnel carriers, etc.  Make advanced infantry that throw grenades if they get too close.Make it an actual rail shooter.  Do convoy security.  Have to protect the friendly vehicles in the convoy until they get to their destination.  You could string along the missions and incorporate a light storyline instead of making them all a fight to the death.  Ideally this entire game would be just an added survival mode feature while a campaign mode made the bulk of the game.I hope you incorporate such into sequels/expansions."

There isn't a lot to it, structure-wise: you have three levels and four skill trees, and you use a machine gun, rocket launcher, and five different support abilities to destroy waves of attacking soldiers and vehicles. It's very reminiscent of classic arcade games, both in its structure and in its difficulty.Its simplicity works in its favor, given how the game progresses. You aren't just completing a stage by defeating X waves of enemies and moving on to the next; your objective is to last as long as possible against an increasingly intense assault, with your eventual score ranked according to both your number of kills and the length of time you spent alive. At the beginning of the game, you're going to die early and often, but as you play, you rack up skill points which you can invest into persistent upgrades across attempts.As you unlock increasingly powerful abilities, you find yourself able to last just a little bit longer each time, and there's a real element of challenge involved in learning how and when to use your support abilities as well as what to prioritize and when. The real challenge of the game is not to finish all three maps (which will happen pretty much no matter what, as ""finishing"" a map is as simple as racking up a certain number of kills across your playthroughs), but to push yourself to see how long you can last. And you will eventually lose: like the recently released Devil Daggers, ""winning"" just means getting further than anyone else before you bite it.My main criticism is a lack of enemy variety: there are normal old soldiers, suicide bombers, technicals, humvees, and three types of landing craft (pontoons, and small and large troop carriers). I'd have liked to see more, different types of soldiers (engineers, grenadiers, machinegunners) or enemy air units.

This is not an excellent game. It's a mediocre one. Do you like games where you stay in one spot and fight off endless waves of enemies until you ultimately die and get your score tallied up? Then you'll probably be okay with this one. Otherwise, you should probably pass. Even for people who enjoy the gameplay, they might find it somewhat stale after a while. In my case, I played it for about three hours. Two of those hours were spent dying over and over again until I finally unlocked all the perks. The entire third hour was spent on the ""desert"" level, gunning down the same waves ad nauseam and realizing, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm effectively invincible. This is as hard as it's going to get. I won't lose unless I actively sabotage myself and self-impose challenges (i.e. conveniently missing all the supply boxes, forgetting to call in infantry, etc.)I look forward to seeing what kind of new life is infused into this game through its mod support, but the vanilla game, as it stands, is ultimately bland and forgettable.

,Not Recommended,448370,35174846,Posted: 24 September,all,Tartrazine,"actually VERY politically correct (really!), and boring after an hourYes, the guys who made Hatred (the awful game about a spree shooter who actually has to KICK most people to death to save his few bullets for the cops) ripped off that old Beachhead arcade game where you fire from a stationary turret at invading soldiers landing on the beach, except the enemies are members of Islamic State so the game is SUPER edgy and politically incorrect, right? Wrong.IS Defense does exactly two ""edgy"" things - there are suicide bomber enemies (and not weird scifi ones like in R6 Siege) and some enemies carry ISIS' flag. That's IT. The opening movie mentions the real life fact that ISIS *renamed* their organization to ""Islamic State"" (i.e. note the crucial distinction that the devs are just saying what ""IS"" stands for, and do NOT actually identify IS as Islamic, even though they factually are) and they declared a caliphate. In the ridiculous dystopian future of the game (which is set in 2020) IS has taken over all of northern Africa, but it takes pains to claim that the locals were all forced to support IS (i.e. there is no mention of Muslims voluntarily joining IS).The guys you're shooting are never identified as Muslims.I'm pretty sure the words ""jihad"" and ""Allah"" are never used!You never even get a good look at the enemy soldiers' faces.There is no gore - the only satisfying kill is when you blow up a truck (which takes a STUPID number of bullets) and the jihadists all go flying as ragdolls.The enemies never ululate (that high-pitched trilling ""la la la la!"" noise that terrorists like to do)You don't get to rescue gays that IS was going to execute.I'm pretty sure you never get to kill any camels. (Even Metal Slug had camels!)There's tons of upgrades (which you NEED to grind for to have any chance of beating the later levels) but nothing offensive - you don't get to upgrade to bacon bullets to do extra damage. You can buy bacon bullets in REAL LIFE, but not in a game about killing thousands of Islamists. Lame."

It's a fun kind of arcade shooter, look around and shoot enemies until you get overrun and last longer by calling in support. the upgrades make it much more enjoyable as you level up, such as no reloading, quicker supports, better infantry support, etc. i would reccomend this just for the feel. only downside is it gets repetative so i (personally) play it in short bursts."

While shallow at first glance, the game has some element of strategy when you combine the 'kill streaks' whereby you enhance your shooting prowess with ground infantry, supply drops and even air strikes to even the odds.  There are leaderboards and a persistent 'character' upgrade path.Great graphics, simple yet addictive gameplay with a small price tag."

For those of us who love games, but don't have  every waking hour to dedicate to them it is so satisfying to be able to pick up and play such an exciting, challenging, and accessible title. Incredibly well done!I would LOVE to see other versions of this made for, say, The American Revolution, or Medieval Battles, or Space Battles etc.... I haven't yet checked out the mods so there may be some great things there too.BRAVO to your team and please keep up the great work!"

Good for an afternoon of letting off steam. Graphics are crappy but who cares when the whole game is about shooting scum from a fixed position with all the support you can think of.

Good story and interesting predictions. Let 'em have it! Maybe DLC in the future could recognise the Kurds in their efforts.

Since there are not so many games in this genre nowadays, this may be the best one of them.BTW, The achievments are quite hard to obtain and some are even bugged for me.If you are in the mood of no-brain shooting terrorists for a  couple of hours, get IS defense."

It was absolutely stupid, but did take some strategy. Nothing like mowing down terrorist A-Holes!"

,Recommended,448370,35233671,Posted: 26 September,all,munchiesnOOb,"This is EASILY the most engaging, refreshing take on a railshooter/defense type game. Its like those old Palisade Guardian games (there are also a few like that but modern) I used to play on flash game sites, only actually good. This game feels so good and enjoyable regardless of its simplicity.The fact that this game is on sale right now for 3 bucks is insane. It is worth WAY more than its usual sale price of 6 bucks, considering the apparent effort and love that was put into the game.There is absolutely no reason for this NOT to be in your library."

,Recommended,448370,35468662,Posted: 4 October,all,Stoney (No Strat),"If you have a problem with the concept behind this game, you might be a cuck.It's nothing special really, simple game mechanics. Almost seems like a Flash game from Newgrounds, but how long would it stay up in that scenario. At least this proves Steam hasn't gone SJW like other companies. They still have the supreme capitilist mindset of ""If there's a crowd that buys it, we sell it"". Fuq ISIS. Fuq Communism."
