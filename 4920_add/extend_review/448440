,Recommended,448440,23017970,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,Rainer,"This little charming hidden gem of a quirkily adventure (accomplished by a one-person development team) deserves a closer look/review. The puzzle (and character/dialogue) design is interesting and funny, but can get very challenging (tricky/illogical) at the end. Although, some puzzles can be skipped.The game offers you to switch between characters and take different approaches on how to solve puzzles/on how to proceed on the main “quest/topic”. The integrated hint/help systems provides additional guidance and support. The general behavior of the game is very slow paced and you need to be patient.The main topic is to reveal the secret behind a bizarre series of earthquake. This keeps you busy for 4-5 hours! (It is somehow influenced by “Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned”) If you do like the classic/retro approach, it is for you."

The game doesn't have much of a plot other then that. The game is very slow paced. You can't run so the entire time you are forced to watch your character walk like a ♥♥♥♥ing turtle. The game is very tedious.... but overall. The game is interesting. Even though I somewhat hate the game, it draws me in to play more and see how it ends. So in my opinion, it is worth 3 dollars. But if you don't have any patience..... like me. STAY AWAY! lol The graphics are nothing special. Reminds me of Resident Evil 2. the audio sucks, at one point it sounded like the Demonic music spewing out of my speakers.

No horror, no blood, no zombies, no vampires, no trashy things : nothing that will hurt your feelings. It's almost family-friendly BUT not in a way that you'll feel like you're playing a children game, far from it. At least it's not violent nor gore.Admittedly it's not realisitic all the way (especially in the end), but it's a game, it's not meant to be a hundred percent plausible and the main idea remains interesting, even though certain aspects of the plot lack some depth. But given the price it's okay and it doesn't take the fun away.Nice graphics, although sometimes animation is a bit awkward. It's still totally playable and enjoyable.The music is fine and appropriate. Pay attention to it, sometimes it changes a bit to signify you did what you were supposed to.It's a well-balanced adventure game : not too easy and not too difficult. Puzzles are solvable but the solution isn't given.There are not too many back and forth in the different areas. Sure you'll have to visit some places twice or more but not in a way that makes you crazy.You can play the whole story as the male or as the female character, or you can switch between them along the way. That gives replayability to the game. The characters don't have the same puzzles to solve in order to make progress in the inquiry.  That way you can ""skip"" something you're stuck in.If you like ""side quest"", not that there is properly one, there are hidden objects to find in the game. Those are not necessary to complete the game but you will need to find (most of) them if you're going for the 100% Achievement.Last but not least. Maybe since it's not a big production , the dev might answer nicely to your relevant observation/question.Given the price and the size of the team I'd give a mark of 8/10. (Don't mind the amount of hours I spent on it, I've done many playthroughs with both characters to write a guide).It's not expensive so give it a try. If you hesitate then wait until it's on sale. Go for it !"
76561198376317844,Recommended,448440,33867862,Posted: 28 July,all,humblehero14,"First of all, I personally don’t recommend this game due to many flaws I had to go through; however, I will give this game a blue thumbs up for putting a lot of effort in the game.  There are still some redeemable qualities to the game.Here are a few flaws that needs pointing out:The “how to play” menu should be available to view if you have an option screen.  I remember my first playthrough (after restarting five minutes in) that I accidentally skipped the “how to play” box.  When I tried to look for it in the settings or the main menu, it is nowhere to be found.  I realize I couldn’t figure out what each cursor meant especially when the pictures are so small to understand.  I had to restart to learn it again.Another issue the dialogue “cut-scenes”.  I believe it is best that we can pause and click after each dialogue.  I feel that the dialogue moves too fast at times and I don’t have enough time to process what they are saying.Another problem is the cursor, specifically the “walking arrow”.  I believe the developer should remove the default arrow.  There are a couple of areas where you only need the default arrow but that should be enabled on the other cursors.  Any item or person that can be clicked, the avatar will walk towards them anyways.  I understand the changing cursors for different dialogue or action purposes but the default cursor should be removed.  If not that, maybe change the setup in your engine.  Sometimes when I forgot to change the cursor, the avatar just walks to the object or person. Sadly, the avatar is now blocking the object or person and starts talking about himself/herself.  At first, it was funny, now it’s annoying.There is a small bug I experience after I leave to the community hub.  After I leave the hub, dialogues tend to go extremely fast out of nowhere.  I’m not sure what causes it.Here are some positives of this game:The game is still pretty cheap and there is a good length before finishing it.The story is bordering passable.  You can feel bored with the whole story or actually feel interested.  The story is different than other games I’ve played so that’s a plus.  I personally thought it was alright but slowly got bored over time.The engine’s graphics won’t blow anyone away but it does feel different than your typical engine such as Unity, Cry Engine, Unreal Engine 4, and RPG Makers.You can play between two different characters and have two different experiences.  I believe this is the developers own unique touch to the game.At the end of it, I believe the developer(s) tries hard to put as much effort in the game to make it quality.  There are several hit and misses that really needs a makeover such as the cursor.  Again, thumbs up for a hard effort but not as recommended; however, if the consumers are curious, they can still try the game out.  The price isn’t expensive."

,Recommended,448440,26415327,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,ed209,"Well.. pushing quality-control under the carpet since this is a one-man effort, I will mention that some of the backdrops are nice. Animation & cutscenes are.. well they add to the humor xD  The 'alternate character' method works at first but kind of snowballs into cluster-♥♥♥♥ mode toward the end. One of the most annoying problems is your character getting in the way of objects you are trying to manipulate with. Clearly it is not without faults (lol), but I will recommend as the story itself is interesting enough and I found many parts to be very funny indeed ;D"

It should be point and click, the action should depend on what you are clicking on, if it's a person then talk, if it's a place or not nearby then walk, if it's actionable then perfom action. Another very annoying thing is the characters have hitboxes 5x bigger than they are so if you click action anywhere near them you get a sarky comment.There are better ways of wasting time than this game, I wouldn't play it if it were free."

If you were born before the 80's you will remember some classic adventures that were so hard because there was only one way to solve a problem and that way did not make sense at all!So here you will find yourself stuck in situations that you have to click specific things in a specific order, otherwise the game does not understand what you are trying to do.I don't mind the broken translation, or the lack of speech of the characters, or the weird story that doesn't make any sense at times (actually most of the time!)... but locking the gameplay in such a manner is just a killer.I got it on a special... I tried to play it and like it... I really did... but even for a few cents I feel like it is just taking space on my HD.."

,Not Recommended,448440,29554987,Posted: 28 January,all,Bodomi,"This game looked like it was really worth it. It looked like it had a decent story and hours ofcontent.It looked like the price of the game(0.18¢, 75% discount)would be justified. It wasn't worth it and I wish I got my 18 cents back and my time back.First of all, let's get the options menu out of the way... yea. It's not there....there is no options menu except for a master volume slider, V-Sync on/off and a brightness slider.The resolution of the game is terrible, you can see the grains. It feels like I'm watching a YouTube video in fullscreen on 360p or something.To give you a hint on how terrible the game is, graphics wise, the game was developed and released in 2016 yet the game can't run at a higer resolution than 720p and the game doesn't include a graphics menu... just...why?Also, opening the Steam in-game overlay will completely brake the game and put in 2 permanent black bars.It's just bad.The English subtitles looks like it's been put into Google Translate. Some words make no sense, words are in the wrong places and some words just don't belong.There is no voice acting, either.The story doesn't make any sense, I'm not gonna sit here for an hour going intensely into the details of it but yea, it just doesn't make any sense.I mean... I guess I might be a little harsh on the story, it wasn't absolutely terrible, but I was constantly reminding myself:but... this doesn't make sense...Sometimes when you click to move somewhere you just instantly teleport there which makes no sense either.I don't know if it's a feature or a bug, but it strangely feels like it's a feature in the game, as if the developers thought it was a good mechanic to just let you teleport around.I guess you can look at it as a move of generosity; they are trying to help you in wasting the least amount of time possible on the game.The game is also filled with bugs, like getting stuck inside doors.Conclusion.I'd rather burn a 100$ note than spend 18 cents on this terriblegame. I'm serious.This game reminds of mussels, the food.You just can't do anything to make mussels good. Mussels are disgusting, horrible. They are just bad, like this game."

Therefore you may encounter bad animations, lack of voice acting (huge downside for PnC game!), terrible spots at translation. But if you really like point and click games, and you don't mind poor graphics - it might be pleasant for you to play it.Please note thatgame was made by one person(to be accurate there is also the person that was responsible for music).The nice surprise is that there are 2 protagonists - you may beat game with switching between them, but it is not necessary.If not - you should avoid this game.
