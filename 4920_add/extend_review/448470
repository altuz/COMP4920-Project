,Not Recommended,448470,23515134,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,past,"this is a puzzle game based around the game of life. im not going to go into what the game of life is exactly because the developer doesn't bother himself (just links to wikipedia from the game), so why should i? but, if you wanted an implementation of game of life to goof around with, buying this for a dollar is fine i guess.as a ""game"" though there's not a whole lot to it. the strategy aspect is more trial and error, or ""spam click until i win."" the game allows you to place points on the grid mid-simulation, but doesnt let you go frame-by-frame in the simulation to accompany this, so if you were actually sitting down and doing the math and trying to figure this out, it seems like there's a need to rely on randomly getting the right frame by spamming pause. or maybe the point is to set it all up beforehand and hitting play and watching the game unfold is more the point, in which case why allow you to put down new life mid-game? the game doesn't really have its priorities straight and the fact that instead of explaining the intention the developer just opens the wikipedia page for conway's game of life in the steam browser is quite frankly insulting.every menu button makes the same extremely high pitched squeak sound which is grating and started giving me a headache after 20 minutes so i stopped playing. on top of that, the whole game runs in 4:3 with black bars on the sides (who has a 4:3 monitor in this day and age), windowed mode didn't work, and the graphics are this muddy mix of a microscope and a CRT screen that just is unappealing and unnecessary. it actually has graphics styled more like a horror game which is ironic considering you'd probably go mad if you played this for longer than an hour. to top it off, even the achievements have this pretentious, ""edgy"" vibe to them and none of the six achievements tell you what you need to do, they're just ""colors are the spice of life"" or ""a doctor gave a man six months to live, but he couldnt pay his bill so he gave him another six months."" how hard is it to just have achievements that actually tell you what you need to do?if you're a HUGE math nerd and love the game of life and actually have the time and ability to sit down and plan out every single point you put down on the grid, go for it, you'll probably have a lot of fun. or if you want something cool to put on your (4:3) monitor and just leave up, you can get some really cool patterns in the simulation mode that morph and change dynamically. i have nothing against the game of life itself, it's awesome, but THIS game is really really mediocre and will probably give you a headache, so this is a thumbs down from me."

In the 1970 's british math guy Conway created this algorithom pattern game dealing with the simulation of cellular automation.  WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN ????!!!! Basically you have a blank screen and you use patterns and diffrent cell combinations to create and destroy life/cells. There is rules and help/simulations with a link to Wikipedia... that I actually think you need to AT LEAST glance over so you have an idea what is going on. There is basically the rule of life or rule of 3. IF there is more than 3, then your cells overpopulated and die. IF there is less than 3, than your cells cant populate and you die. SO, click on the screen and see what happens and click click and watch. ALOT. One click you are winning and close to the blank screen or the life/dead cells you are trying to get rid of are almost done, then BOOM life exploads forth as you tighten your grip on your mouse and start all over. The music is kinda hypnotic and soothing, but the game itself even though called relaxing.. isnt really. Have fun and actually learn a real science math concept. Life is hard. and Life finds a way and yeah your mind goes to all the awesome quotes about life while you do reliaze, its not as easy as it seems."

Navigating menus has never been this annoying and I'm not invested enough into Game of Life as a concept. Can't really recommend this one."
,Not Recommended,448470,30528402,Posted: 15 March,all,BG,"I know it is based on Conway's game of life bla bla bla, but Conway's is a set of mathmatics rules, it is not a game.What Bacteria does is exaclty the same thing, so it can not be called a game.By the way, calling it Bacteria deviates the concept here. This has nothing to do with bacteria.Frustating."

All you can do is place a glider headed in roughly the right direction and hope for the best. You might as well just go play the actual Game of Life with some nice music playing in the background.

They really need to do more than complain about the how-to-play wiki link. Maybe read the information there? Having played the original game back in the 70s the link was mostly a refresher for me.This game is about how ""life"" achieves ballance. There are two modes, hard and very hard. In hard mode you are attempting to get equilibriam; no births, no deaths. In very hard you are attempting to get the number of ""cells"" down to a specific number.The interface is straight forward. Right side has menu, run/pause, and speed. Left side has the buttons for adding cells. There is add one, and three patterns. The three patterns are designed to ""crawl"" across the play area by following the growth/death rules.It can take a bit to understand how this all works together. It can also take a bit of time to actually achieve the goals for each level. But a bit of persiveriance and you will be able to work it out. After all this is a puzzle game."

The game does not explain itself. I had no clue what the heck I was doing! Just watch my game play video below and laugh at my incompetence.https://youtu.be/RmsP9z0bWGIThe video reveals what you will be experiencing at 1080p first time launching.

I agree with them, what I don't understand is why they thought this and then gave e positive score to this game. When I play a puzzle game Ineedto know what I'm doing, or at least what I should achieve, that's the heart of puzzle gameplay!This game leaves you alone, it gives you no clue, it just shows you some levels, you start one of them, and you have to figure out what your goal is. This first step is actually easy: there are theseunstableshapes on the screen and you have to stabilize them.How?Here it gets tricky. You have to design other figures in a shape so they can move towards the unstable ones and stabilize them.How?I honestly don't entirely know. What happens felt random to me, but I'm sure there are patterns you can recognize and use to complete the levels, I'm also sure the game isn't compelling enough to persuade me to make an effort to fully understand how it works.I think this is always a mistake: when you design a game that asks people to struggle in order to understand how it works you will always lose the interest of those who aren't dazzled by the game from the start, meanwhile what are the benefits of this design choice? I can't find a convincing one, maybe deceiving the player so she won't immediately notice the gaps of the game?I love puzzle games based on logic but what is a total deal breaker here is that you have tothrowthe shapes you create from one side of the screen to the other one in order to hit the shapes you have to stabilize. To do this you have to guess the right trajectory and cross your fingers, and logic here pretty much dies, because you will always loose cause ofbad aim.So go play bowling, at least it's honest about what it asks you to do.ConclusionsA bowling game disguised as something smarter which doesn't gives you any clue about what to do in order to keep hiding its true identity.A lot of people won't say this is a bad game cause they feel stupid doing so.How can I say I don't like this just because I didn't understand this? People will think I'm stupid! I will say I love this, because smart people love smart things!Duh!So, if you think you are cool when you struggle understanding step by step boring things other people don't understand, you will love this game, otherwiseskip it."

,Not Recommended,448470,35160215,Posted: 23 September,all,"BootRecords, M.Sc.","So, I bought this game out of, more or less, scientific curiosity, as back when I was studying I also took a course on cellular automata, which are basically a generalisation of Conway's Game of Life (i.e. 'games' based on the same principles, but with different rule sets). I was curious as to how one would game-ify this principle, as Game of Life (and CAs in general) tend towards chaotic behaviour, that is behaviour that is technically strictly deterministic, but happens at a scale that to humans it must seem almost completely random.And as you may guess, so is this game. Don't get me wrong - it's a very decent Game of Life simulation, but gamification on a highly chaotic system just doesn't work. Your best bet when trying to play this game is to set the difficulty to easy (as that lets you manipulate the whole ""board"") and then add single cells to the complex structures (or take a few away) and watch the levels collapse on themselves. The higher difficulty levels, in which you have to rely on ""gliders"" (specific cell configurations that result in a moving mass of basically stable size) to help you clear the board, are basically just click-and-pray, unless you really love the underlying computational model and spend a few hours to find a proper solution starting from the limited starting space you have.So yeah, as a game, I can't recommend Bacteria. If you always wanted a decent simulator for Conway's Game of Life, however, feel free to spend that Euro. I don't regret buying it, but I certainly won't recommend it for the ""game"" part."

I didn't expected much from this game and i didin't get too much from it.Game is simply boring. At easy - it is too easy, at hard it is too random. It is only good if you want too turn of thinking and just watch some moving and changing pixels. It has some relaxing music.And all of this is ok for this low price.Overall: 2/10"
