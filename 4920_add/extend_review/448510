,Recommended,448510,32648410,Posted: 22 June,all,dollfacedan,"Best Multiplayer game in years.  When 4 people get together and cook as a team, nothing feels more rewarding beating your own high score as a group and not failing any orders in that round.  It's main campaign is co-op based, with you and up to 3 more players prepping ingredients, cutting, cooking, stewing, serving, and washing dishes.  THe levels can be plain, with interesting bottlenecks in the kitchen design, to surreal and bizarre, like hanuted houses that siwtch the stations around, or cooking and serving between 2 moving trucks on a highway.Steam Link integration is superb, allowing for some of the best Couch co-op I've played in years.  The rules and controls are extremely easy, but incredibly difficult to master as a cohesive team, but very fun and rewarding as a group experience.  No wars would exist, racism would end, injustice stamped out, if everyone in the world played Overcooked.A must have game."

It's a shame we didn't have a reason to try to get that level of perfection out of all of the levels.We played mostly as 2 player but we did try 4 player once, it was much easier to achieve a perfect 3 start result.9/10"

Playing single player is certainly possible, but it's clearly not designed for it.I was planning on refunding it but I figure the devs could use the money to work on online multiplayer, which it sorely needs.

While this feature would be nice to have eventually, I would rather see more content and even tighter gameplay because this game is suited to be a local co-op game. There is no greater feeling than to be right there with your fellow chefs, as your kitchen quickly turns into a loud, cooking frenzy.Pro'sSimple, Easy to learn controlsPlenty of Unique and enjoyably characters to play asThe levels get progressively harder at a nice paceI loved that the game never taught you aboutdashing and swearing, it was something we discovered for ourselvesCon'sThe single-player is pretty devastatingly hard because you have to control two different characters by switching between them. I do not suggest playing this game by yourself, it's better to grab a friend.I wish that there was a way to pick which part of the kitchen you spawn in from the level screen, currently it is based on the player order, but there were times where we wanted to swap stations in order to perform better, and that would have required us to swap controllers. (Some kitchens are partitioned, and there is no in-game way to get to the other side)Sometimes fires spread too quickly to extinguish, and based on the layout of the counters, it is extremely difficult to completely put out the flames which led to games where 1 person had to constantly man the extinguisher and we end up failing the level anyways. However, this is not too much of a concern because recent gameplay makes me think this mechanic was tweaked, and if not, it makes our group even more vigilant about watching the cooking ingredients.Overall, I really love this game, and I am looking forward to seeing more content from the developers."

Had heard good things about Overcooked so downloaded and was glad I did.I played with younger family members who are 5, 13 and 16 and they all enjoyed it.

I am reluctant because I have things to do but once you pick that controller up you can't put it down.  ""Only 20 points off getting the 3 stars.  Let's do it again""  and again and again and then the wife comes in from work.  ""why is the kitchen a tip?  Could you not have put the bins out?  Why are you both in your underpants and vests""?  and then the son starts ""dad im starving.  I havent ate all day""  I reply ""me neither.  We havent moved off this chair all day""  That is overcooked guys.Best co-op game I have played.  A real emphasis on teamwork.Only negative I would say about the game is that some of the levels are crazy difficult to get 3 stars on.  To the point of actually not possible.  We are onto level 5-2 now.  Probably near completion but not sure we will be able to complete it as you need a certain amount of stars to progress to the next level and some we simply can't do.Other than the campaign there is also a versus mode.  This is very enjoyable too.  You go head to head.  2 chefs each to control by switching them with LB.  You compete against eachother to see who can get the most points (orders completed)  Some real tension and excitement with this game mode as well.I think if they added multiplayer instead of local then this game be a 10/10.  Since they havent done this I give it a 9.5/10."

Online multiplayer is non-existent and single player requires you to control two chefs at once. No adding NPCs to help you, no allowing you to dial down (or up) the difficulty at will, and you can only progress by getting certain numbers of stars per level--your only options are to get lucky with simple orders or grind until you're blue in the face, otherwise you're stuck.Thumbs up if you have another friend with a controller/keyboard!

Me and my sister, who played the whole game 3 staring till the last level,had to restart the last level at least 20 times. The timing is important on it, which is the longest level, lasting 12 minutes and has the stupid unskippable cutscence at the startOne weird thing about the difficulty is that the points required to get 3 stars is actually easier with the fewer people. Soloing them was insanely easy, 2 players is easy still, even if one isn't that goodbut with 4, you need to all be great, because the requirement scales more and is harder to get.My only gripe of the game, was it's hard to grab and put things on the correct countertop, and can ruin some runs of a levelMy Score:APrice:$14Completed in:20 hours(less if not going for all 3 stars)Games similar:Cook, Serve, Delicious!Keep Talking and Nobody ExplodesThe Jackbox Party PackStikbold!

,Recommended,448510,29552899,Posted: 28 January,all,SuperChutney,"Overcooked is one of the most enjoyable local multiplayer games I've ever played with friends and family. It's not a game for everyone, as the mechanics lend themselves to creating a gameplay experience that can be stressful or frustrating at times, and it's not perfect, but it comes together into an engaging multiplayer game that's easy to learn and difficult to master, and feels brilliant when you manage to work as a team to reach the three star ranking.The basic premise (""cook well together to win!"") immediately makes it more accessible for a 'non-gamer' audience than the themes of many other local multiplayer games. It's simple too: chop the ingredients, cook them, plate them up, send them out, and wash the dirty dishes when they come back. Easy to explain, though considerably less easy in practice. What if you only have one chopping board? What if you can only access your stove top at certain times? What if the only way you pass ingredients to each other is along a conveyer belt with a gaping-wide bin of bottomless dimensions waiting at the end?There's about 30 levels in the base game, which do an excellent job of teaching you the basics before ramping up to scenarios that seem impossible at first glance. Though some levels are more easily three-starred than others, most levels you'll need to try more than onces to figure out the gimmicks, how to work around them, and how to make the process efficient enough to reach the three star threshold. This game structure accommodates players of different skill levels well: chuck your less confident players on ingredient-fetching duty or get them in charge of washing dishes, and they'll be playing just as vital a role as anybody else. Both the free Xmas-themed and the paid jungle-themed DLCs add several more levels once you've see everything the main campaign has to offer.Another aspect contributing to its pick-up-and-play nature are the bite-sized levels, most taking no more than a few minutes. Though the tasks may sound monotonous and repetitive, in my experience this was rarely the case. There's an ebb and flow to the tempo over each level: you might start off going well and pushing out orders only to realise that now all your plates are dirty and your pots are all over the place and your next ticket is very close to expiring, which slaps you with a point penalty. Or you spend the first half of the level always waiting on mushrooms because they're situated far from the chopping boards and then find you've prepared too many and you're literally drowning in mushrooms that are rolling all over the floor because SOMEBODY chopped too many instead of getting that onion soup ready and you TOLD them you were too busy with the dishes to help-All together it comes to a fun, frantic and frequently-chaotic experience that many people will find enjoyable but some people will not. Best played with two or three friends that don't mind taking and giving orders, but also don't get too upset when somebody accidently leaves the soup on for too long or adds the wrong ingredient to the burger that was about to go out.Because that will happen. A lot.Some considerations and flaws it would be remiss of me not to mention:- The star ratings on each level seem to favour lower player counts, with some four-player ratings being very difficult to achieve.- The controls (specifically, the picking up and putting down of items) can be very picky, which may be an intentional choice to punish sloppy controlling, but it can be very frustrating to new players when combined with the time pressure.- There is a vs. mode, but other than that, once you three-star all the levels there's really nothing else for you to do with the game.- Since the vs. mode has little in the way of luck or random variance, the more skilled player is going to win everytime.- The game can be played single player, but really loses a lot of the appeal of the game without teaming up with anybody else.- No online multiplayer, folks!"

So keep that in mind if you're looking at this game.This game will keep you on the edge of your seat with its fast paced chaotic play style. I would reccomend getting this game if you have atleast one other dedicated player to join you. The game builds on simple concepts so it's easy to learn to play but takes about an hour to get the feel of it and even then the high paced nature of it will either enthrall you or frustrate the hell out of you. If you can keep track of multiple things at once, running around trying to get dishes ready while simultaneously giving out commands to your friends playing with you, you will love this. If you're an anxious person this game might not be for you.In short, if you have people to play with who are willing to sit down for a while and get good, and play with you for entire game, then it's great. If you're looking to just take up time and play a quick game with someone who has never played, well just don't expect to beat any highscores, or any of the difficult levels, which depending on your skill level may be the vast majority of the game.The DLCs are also great, adding new recipes, characters, and maps."

,Recommended,448510,25364395,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,[ARX]AnthonyPS,"Overcooked is a Shared/Split Screen Co-Op cooking game made by Ghost Town Games. Its gameplay focuses on the co-op element and I can say this game is definitely a 'hardcore' co-op. This game requires an intense coordination with your 'cookmates', quick reaction, time management, and a huge amount of focus.GameplaySkip this paragraph if you don't care about the storyHere's a bit of a lore to give you the idea of what's going on. Don't worry, these are all the intro of the game so they're not spoilers. Set in a ""not so distant future"", the world was coming to an end and a massive spaghetti meatballs monster is crushing the world. In order to survive, you need to cook onion and tomato salads to satisfy those delicious apocalyptic creatures. After you and your cookmates failed horribly, the Onion King sent you back to the past to train your cooking skills and save the world in the future.You will now work in multiple different so-called kitchens in different environments, offering different challenges and foods to cook. Gameplay in general is 2-4 people playing as chefs, running around weirdly designed kitchens where they need to cook different types of foods to get enough money and achieve three stars. The kitchens are specially and well-designed by the devs to ensure you will coordinate with your friends. Some kitchen can be completely separated every several seconds, some kitchens only have one-person walkway, some kitchens have obstacles in them that will prevent you from moving around, some kitchens have mouses that will steal your food, etc.In these specially designed kitchens, you need to cook different kind of foods like burgers and soups. The most common way to cook is: Take the ingredient - Boil/Fry the ingredients - Put it on a plate - Serve - Wash Dishes - Repeat. It may seems easy, but the kitchen and the overwhelming orders will create complete chaos (chaotic fun) if you don't coordinate well.The main advantage of the gameplay is its 'reach'. Everyone can play this game as long as they are able to use a keyboard or a controller. To clarify my point, games like CSGO, Battlefield, Need For Speed, Dark Souls, and almost every game out there only attracts a very specific demography - male young adults. Co-Op Games like Overcooked, Gang Beasts, Monopoly, etc that successfuly created a friendly and fun co-op experience for all genders and ages are pretty uncommon to find these days. I saw several other reviews that gives this game a thumbs up because of 'My wife likes it' or 'My 7 years olds have a lot of fun with Overcooked' or ' My girlfriend loves this game' or other similar reasons. This is what makes this game so good - it has a co-op based gameplay that is fun for everyone and can be used to strengthen their players' bond with others. I personally also feel this benefit - I play this game with my sister who's not a gamer (she only plays PokemonGO and Reign) and she never plays any co-op or MP games with me before, yet we had a lot of fun playing Overcooked for hours.'Bad' PartsBut, I do have some things that I don't like from Overcooked. It's all of those splitting-kitchens, like the earthquake kitchen or the food truck kitchen. First of all, we thought it might be an interesting challenge to have the kitchen split every several seconds. But then, we realized there's really almost nothing to do when the kitchen separates. The intense yellings like 'I NEED MY TOMATOES NOW' or 'WHERE'S THE LETTUCE BURGERS OMFG IT'S ON FIRE' completely died out as soon as the kitchen splits. All we can do is chop stuff and wait until the kitchen's back. Or the worst part - wait until we can extinguish the other half part of the kitchen that's completely on fire. We both felt that it's a bit of a design 'flaw' - although it's not necessarily is - since it really 'killed' the co-op moments.ConclusionOvercooked is definitely one of the best split screen co-op games out there. You can enjoy it with your family, with your friends, with your soulmates or whoever. I highly recommend this game if you have some fun people to play with.Thank you for reading!"

The singleplayer content is effectively a watered down version of the multiplayer, and not worth the price.The multiplayer though, that's a whole other story. This is one of the best examples of a simple concept done to perfection. Top down cooperative cooking. Seems simple enough. But these developers know esactly how to push that concept to it's absolute limit. What starts out as simple salads and soups being prepared in ergonomic kitchens quickly ramps up into fun and unique challenges. Soon, you'll be passing burgers between speeding trucks, fighting an army of rats for soup ingredients, and dodging fireballs while carrying burritos from station to station.Each new map means a whole new system for your team, and the pace is just hectic enough to be a meaty challenge without being impossible. Once you get a system nailed down; and you and your friends are working like a well oiled machine, that's when this game come into it's own.The style, the gameplay, the performance is all nailed down and poolished to a mirror shine.

And every single time the assigned jobs are completely disregarded and our master scheme becomes completely irrelevant as the game uses every trick up its sleeve against you, whether it be moving your counters or placing you in a moving van,  your well-coordinated plan will most definitely devolve into a choatic mess creating shouting match against everybody like a low budget ""Hell's Kitchen"", except everybody thinks that their Gordon Ramsay and that everybody else is the Idiot Sandwich.However, the campaign is quite short, that is if you don't plan to 3 star everything, around 30% of it's difficulty can be attributed to it's rather clunky controls. Also, and this is a minor nit-pick, it's can be difficult to spot your cook amongst the haze of confusion because the only visual indication of who's controlling which character is the appearance you chose, which is mostly obscured by their toque.It's incredibly simple to learn and alot of fun with friends, however I urge you to NOT buy this game if you don't have any friends to play this with, as the single player is incredibly boring, and remember, two's a company, three's a crowd, and four's a thrilling frenzied clutter of anarchy and mayhem."

The days I spent in the 90s playing games like Goldeneye with other kids in neighboorhood were some of the best times of my childhood, but today, couch gaming like this just isn't an option for me, like it or not.I saw let's plays of this game and thought it looked really neat. Figured I'd throw in some support and bought it for myself and some friends in the hopes that it would get online later if it did well and unfortunatley that is not the case.If online ever comes, this review will change, but it doesn't really look that way with how long it's been. Not smart. This game could have been a much bigger thing if you'd made it more accessable."

This involves cleaning and grabbing a dish, picking up and preparing ingredients, not burning stuff (and if you do, putting out the fire), putting them together and then serving them.The difficulty lies within how fast you prepare these dishes and how the level is set up. Sometimes you don't have everything on ""your side"" so you need to hand each other ingredients or done meals to get the job done.Additionally, some levels come with environmental hazards which kill you and force you to wait a few seconds before respawning. Each level also has its own set of recipes which need to be cooked.You can play together with up to two players per controller, each holding one side and having one stick to use each, meaning you only need two controllers minimum for four players.The main story took about 10h to beat with three stars on every level (2 players). Alternatively, you can compete with each other in a face-off match and see who can cook more meals in the same time."

If, however, you can get at least one other person to play with (you can even share the keyboard, if you don't have controllers), this game really shines.One big caveat, though: I got 100% of everything in 6 hours, so don't come in expecting a long game."

Oddly my fascination with cooking doesn't come from watching real chefs work, or the food itself. Instead it comes from watching mobster movies. For some reason most of them had a part where an old Italian dudes cooked. I don't know, they just made it look cool. After burning regular rice, chicken breast, eating uncooked oatmeal, etc, I can confirm there is no chef in me. And now I relay on wife to keep me alive.Overcooked doesn't particularly concentrate on the cooking itself, but rather on coordination to get the food ready on time. You will be given a set of meals to prepare and serve. You start by receiving the order, prepare the ingredients, cooking them, and finally arrange them for service. You'll also handle washing the dishes, and in case of overcooking fires will breakout and you'll have to extinguish them.The whole process in itself starts simple by giving you easy orders of Onion soup or Tomato soup, but in no time you'll be cooking burgers. You will have to cook the burger, cut the tomatoes and lettuces, put it all in a bun, and serve it in a sandwich. The first difficulty comes when playing co-op is who will do which part to run the process as fast as possible. The need for coordination could test your relationship with the other player, as it tested my marriage.The developers up the difficulty, brilliantly, with terrific level design. Some levels will have rats stealing any unattended food, floors made of ice, another level where the whole kitchen is on two moving trucks on a highway. The trucks move away from each every couple of minutes, splitting the kitchen in two. The level design is terrific and varied keeping the experience fresh.The narrative part, which is odd for it to have one to start with, is really well done. You're a cook in the Onion Kingdom, which was invaded by a horrific monstrosity that will destroy the kingdom if not fed enough food, in a short time. You start the game by cooking for the monster, then beaten by the fact that you're not good enough. At that time the Onion King save you and travel back in time so you would have enough time to travel the world, and sharpen your cooking skills, so when the day comes you will be ready.The biggest problem with the game is that it doesn't support online co-op. I get the idea that the experience is so much better as a couch co-op, but still why not provide a practical option.Overall Overcooked is a simple game, with simple mechanics and graphics, put together to shape a smart, funny, couch co-op experience that will test your patience, and relationships, especially with your significant other.8/10"

It requires careful strategy with your partners, but can often become frustrating for your partner or yourself. Allowing to play with controllers and keyboards (or splitting one into two pads) really allows you to bring in a lot of players. The versus mode is a bit different with longer cutting time, so the transition from campaign to versus can get some getting used to. I did not notice any significant bugs in the game.

If you think you want to play it by yourself, skip it, it's impossible to play solo.This is a great Co-Op game, really pulls you in and everyone has a blast playing it. It is a great party game to bust out whenever you have some bored friends over and looking to play a fun game for minutes to hours at a time. There are three small problems with it:1. The campaign is pretty short, even for this type of game. Two friends and I beat the game in 3-4 hour sitting, with a fair amount of pauses for breaks. Then one friend and I went back and got all three stars in every level in another hour or so. Which brings me to my next point...2. This is a game for a 2 or 4 person group. I had two friends with me, and it was near impossible to get three stars in a three player game, as the amount of points you need nearly doubles from two people to three. You can get to the boss with three people, but don't expect to 100% this with a three man party or BY YOURSELF.3. THIS IS NOT A SINGLE PLAYER GAME. You may get about half way through, if you are really good, but you will not get enough stars to get anywhere close to the final stages. Period. The game trys to let you play two characters with one controller, but the amount of focus you have to put into what you are doing simply stops any single person in their tracks, and at some points in a stage you have to be looking at two completely different corners of your screen at the same time to be effectively managing your kitchen.

It can be played only in couch coop, using keyboard and/or controller. The keyboard controls are fine, but I recommend using a controller.I played through the campaing of the game in 2p coop in around 4 hours. The levels are split into five different themes, each with their own gimmick. The levels in each theme are varied and well designed. They are all designed in such a way as to try to mess up your ability to cook effectively, so finding the best way to divide the workload in each level is a large part of completing them.Besides the campaign there is a competetive game mode which you unlock the levels for by playing through the campaign. The levels 9 available here brings the total number of level up to 35, which is fine if the competetive mode is something you and whoever you play with enjoy. If not, then the 26 levels of the campaign feels like a bit too few.The lack of campaign levels is really my only problem with this game. The gameplay is great fun, and the more the merrier.The music of the game reminds me of Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, and Generic-90'something-Family-Film.

The main reason I'm writing this review though, is to give props to the keyboard + controller support. The game has built in DS4 support and there's zero hassle to go into a local multiplayer game using a combination of keyboard and controllers. I just realized this is not a trivial thing to make possible, because I tried playing other multiplayer games and it is maddening to get this to work with most of them.As far as the game itself, it's fun to frantically run around grabbing ingredients, chopping them up, etc. while screaming at your friend(s) to PLEASE GET ME ANOTHER POTATO AND OH NO WE'RE OUT OF PLATES PLEASE CLEAN SOME! While it can get tough, it's not too hard to go through the levels. If you want to get 3 stars on all of them though, that's a different story."

First, the negatives: the controls are a bit slippery, the levels become unneededly convoluted, and the ""recipes"" are a bit dull.  That all being said, this game is a pretty solid local co-op title.  By forcing the player to communicate the room will quickly turn into sounding like an Applebee's kitchen with players yelling things at each other like ""I said LETTUCE AND TOMATO NOT JUST LETTUCE!!"" or ""put the damn mushrooms in the pot!...okay it's on fire now.""  The challenges are mostly fun, stressfull, and feel achievable if the players work together.  Single player has you alternate between 2 characters which ends up sapping most of the magic from the game; this, and the lack of online multiplayer cause significant issues with long-term playability.   The look is very Animal Crossing meets Fisher Price Little people and gets the job done for a silly line-cook sim.  Future incararnations would do good to include online team 4v4, tighten up the controls and either improve or do-away-with the little ""story"" they attempted to crowbar in.

Feels great now! Finally, I have absolutely no problem recommending this game. My daughter and I can now play local co-op without having to quit in complete frustration over our characters just walking off on their own while we are having a great time doing a run. Nothing ruins a game quicker than bad controls, and this game no longer suffers from that issue. Thank you, Devs!(ORIGINAL REVIEW)I'd really love to recommend this game, but given the absolutely horrible control for this game with the most common controller used (360), I just can't. To make this even more frustrating, this is basically a game made primarily for couch co op. Why would a game of this type not have addressed this issue already? Get on the boards and you'll see legions with the same issues with controls. Mystifying. Nothing appears to be being done to address this issue. This game also requires precise movement and your character will just walk off in its own direction throughout the entire session on all controllers being used simultaneously. There are no dead zone options to adjust this available in-game. Such a huge disappointment, because it's such a fun game...absolutely ruined by horrible controls and apparent horrible support. Don't buy until this gets addressed. I'm skeptical that anything is currently being done to address this. Again, hugely disappointing."

The objective is to make your movements worth every second of the time that you are given to complete as many orders as you can. Chop, cook (to the right temperature), plate and serve al while your kitchen moves, shifts order, rats steal your vegetables and general mayhem happens. You will cook in the desert, on the road, in the middle of busy street and even on an iceberg.Also, you may play vs. stages that you unlock once you clear stages and you may also get achivements. Most are easy to gather but completionists will definitely appreciate the challenge of completing all of the stages with 3 stars.There's even a cat character to choose among other unlockable characters.Great music and simple, animated graphics.Bottom line: This game is a very fun, family, light-hearted game.

If you toss all those ingredients in a pot, season it with a LOT of chaos and the dish is ready to be served: An addictive product of chaos, challenge and pure enjoyment and entertainment for everybody!You basically have a kitchen, a handfull ingredients and cooking devices depending on the stage and sometimes special events that affect the layout of the stage during a level which causes even more chaos. The key is countering the chaos with everyone having a certain role of task to get everything done in time for the customers to serve the finished food, and that's exactly what makes the game worth playing. You can yell at each other - meant friendly ofc - and try out different tactics to get a level done.You learn different recipes that you have to master at finishing quick and safe on every occasion, and environmental disorders that might or might not happen. There's even a little story wrapped around the game, but is not worth mentioning beyond this sole fact. There are a handfull of characters to pic as an playing avatar, most of which are cute and nice little avatars, which add a bit costumization but nothing for the gameplay.What I can't stress enough is that you really should view this as a coop-only gaming experience, this is nothing for solo play. The good thing is, that you can split a controller or keyboard into two halfs, so two people can play with only one input-device.It was one of the few games where I got not only a friend of mine, but also my sister and little brothers to all play along simoultaniously and which resulted into the previously mentioned lack of arrangement, and everyone was screaming at each other while the kitchen started to burn and the customers not getting their orders in time! Hilarious time I had with this game. Unfortunally there is just one overpriced DLC, hopefully more content will come in the near future (even if it doesn't seam that way at the moment). Even more life-extending for this game could be an online feature it really misses, and a modding and workshop option would be a dream, that is unlikely to happen sadly..Still the most important fact is that you have at least one other person to play this game with, otherwhise this game looses all its taste as the above mentioned recipe just lacks something!!"

After playing it, however, I can say that I CANNOT recommend this game... enough.  The game is just flat out fun and a blast to play.  When you start a new level and you only get that 1 star (if you make it), you instantly end the round and have a session of strategy with your co-op partners as to who needs to be doing what and where they need to be doing it, so you can brake that score and get into a higher score / star level.The game is an absolute blast.What I have found even more amazing is that it is not just the playing of the game that grants you enjoyment, but there have been many others that have enjoyed just WATCHING the players play the game and they are laughing harder than the ones that are working in the kitchen.  From the standard:  ""I need a plate!  I need a plate! SOMEONE BRING ME A PLATE!!!!"" panic moments, to the odd ""Um, why is there an uncooked burger patty on the ground!??!"" or 'You just THREW AWAY A PERFECTLY GOOD BURGER IN THE TRASH!"", this game will test your friendships and keep you in stitches the entire time.If you like co-op couch games and have three friends to spare, look no further than this little gem. :D"

It's good that we have a healthy relationship and thick skin with each other, because there has been lots of yelling and face-palming between the both of us as we play. I feel the game is best in short spurts (pick it up for 20-40 minutes and then out it down for a while) but it's always fun to come back to.Competitive mode is more fun than I expected, as my daughter figured out she could gain an edge by blocking me from crucial kitchen equipment and I showed her how much it helped me to steal ingredients from her conveyor belt. Competitive mode has less yelling ""No, don't go there. Bring the lettuce over here!"" and more yelling ""Ahh!  Get away from my cutting board!'My daughter was disappointed that at the start of the game only one of the four available characters is female. But soon after we unlocked the cat and she has been using it since.With the game being so cheap and fun (with a nice level of polish) I actually would like to see some DLC from the developers. I'd gladly pay more for more recipes and levels, though we've come nowhere near to exhausting (or even seeing) the content already in the game.TLDR; Fun for all ages. Challenging and stressful in a good way. Great controller support. Loads of replay value."

Each level throws your previous plan out the window (which I like) while still allowing certain players to stick with certain roles. I work in hospitality so it is satisfying to assign players roles and watch everyone work together as a well oiled machine.Only critisism would be that local co-op only limits play time when you don't have a couple of friends to play with. This is not a loss for the game, however it limits the amount of time I will play it. I would also say that there are some frustrating quirks in the game such as food getting stuck on corners of benches and plates getting fused into the sink.

Haven't tried it single player but I can't imagine it's anywhere near as good. The whole point of this game is trying to organise 2-4 people in to some sort of coherent team under intense pressure, with fun and silly mechanics making everything harder.The funniest moments are when everything goes wrong, when the kitchen's on fire and someone falls to their death holding the only fire extinguisher and everyone's running around panicking and no one knows what to do. When you're screaming for someone to bring you lettuce to get the last burger out so you can get 3 stars and they put it on the wrong plate and then someone tries to help and picks up the thing you're trying to complete and everything falls apart. When you try to put the soup in a bowl and end up just throwing it straight in the bin because you're rushing. Then at the end you start the level again because you KNOW you can do it better.Played about 9 hours over a couple days and finished the campaign, but haven't 3 starred everything yet, to give you an idea of play time. Hope they add some extra levels at some point!Pros:Audio and Visuals are good.Runs well.Great gameplay and level design.Just the right level of challenging, you will fail some while you learn the mechanics, but once you and your team get a good system in place you'll do better than you thought you could.Easily learnable / understandable for non-gamers or children.Good variety of levels and foods.Cons:No deadzone settings for controllers, this really needs to be added. (In the mean time google Durazno if you're having problems)No online play. Depending on how well the developers could make it work, this should definitely be added. They are limiting their market by making it local co-op only, though locally would still definitely be the best way to play.Maybe a little short, though it is only £13, depends on your sense of value I suppose!Anyway, definitely recommended if you can gather a few friends for a silly, shouty, frustrating and, most of all, fun team building exercise."

This game requires organisation and cooperation to not have your kitchen go up in flames.GAMEPLAY - 9/10 CHAOSI went into this game doubtful that I would do well as all of the Let's Players I have watched fail epically as they try to make soup and other things. Gameplay wise the controls are simple and easy to come to grips with, but the platforming was much to be desired for, specific stages screwed you over with moving platforms which didn't handle right. Could have been better, otherwise the actual mechanics are great. Nothing feels quite as acomplishing than learning how to create dishes and learn how to plan your strategy without even realising you are getting getter.GRAPHICS - 7/10 SIMPLISTICNot much to say about the graphics, it is pretty basic but it doesn't need to be flashy because the other elements of the game is what counts!SOUND - 9/10 CHOP, CHOP, CHOP!Empathising on what I said earlier, the gameplay and sound rather go together, as you're copping tomatoes and sizziling burgers it feels natural and pleasing to the ears. The music is also awesome as when time is running out it speeds up, creating a sense of urgency and a heads up to get♥♥♥♥♥♥done.MULTIPLAYER - 10/10 WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE?!I played this whole game with one other person and we had a blast, she really enjoyed being able to play as a team in a light-hearted game environment, we laughed a whole damn lot and high fived everytime we pursused that 3 star rating on each stage. If you don't have anyone to play with go make a friend and force them to play this game and then instantly lose friendship over hot soup. The core of the game basically says work together or die together, it's where the fun lies, communicating with team mates and helping each other with information.VERDICT - 10/10 BUY THIS GAMESummed up it's worth the money! :D The completion side of the game is fufilling and we still have cheap DLC to buy, epicness all round!"

The goal of my review is simply to clarify what this game is, and what it isn't. The bottom line is thatOvercookedis a solid arcade action title, that unfortunatley lacks any kind of kitchen management and thus was not what I was expecting.Overcookedis a frantic arcade romp best played with two or more players.If you are expectingDiner Dash, you should first watch some LetsPlays because I think you will be disapointed. I wanted kitchen micromanagement, upgrades, menus, and food preparation - and what I got was mostly arcade style food preparation with some truly wild levels/scenerios.Yeah, it's cute and works well, but it's also pretty one-dimensional and is probably best only really played at parties.I personally think they could have added in more of the management parts and the game would have only benefitted. Why not have a clear-cut day length and goal for how much money you make? Why not have overhead costs in the campaign mode, and quality-of-life upgrades that can be bought for the kitchen? I guess that just wasn't the game they wanted to make.Pros:+Definitely fun with friends in a party setting+Minimal controls are great and work well; there are some clever settings for getting four players to play with only two controllersCons:-The story is forgettable and should have been just left out-Beyond the arcade action in the kitchen, there is little else-The world map looks impressive, yet has little function-The zany levels with kitchens being cracked in half are cute but not what I was really looking forIf you play a lot of party games, this should be in your collection - on the other hand if you are interested in games likeCook, Serve DeliciousorDiner Dash, I'd think twice before taking the plunge withOvercooked.It's just a different thing, really."

As amusing as this sometimes can be, I haven't gotten very far because of it. I also hope that one day I will be able to play online with my friends. Getting everyone to my house at once for a game is a pain sometimes with conflicting schedules. Other than those issues, great game. If I can figure out how to stop it from forcing me to choose a second character it would be an AMAZING GAME. I'd reccommend it to anyone."

I was playing with my girlfriend as a co-op experience and the first section of the game is amazing. It presents a good challenge, and simple mechanics that all come together to make a fun game.The part I enjoyed, and what I feel they should have emphasised for difficulty is the cooking. Burgers require various toppings and orders are varied; fish and chip plates vary as well as numerous types of soup. When orders are coming quick, and you're trying to keep ontop of chopping veggies/meats, cooking, washing dishes and taking out orders on time... this is where the game excels. They needed to just do levels with more variety and combinations of food to increase the difficulty; but instead they decided to keep the food relatively simple and focus on one or two items per level and make the level difficult to navigate.The game goes downhill when tables start moving, you're on moving trucks, conveyor belts and various other things that don't let partners work as a team - but it decides for you what you'll be doing in each level. This went too far for me when one of the levels was pitch black and you are using flashlights to navigate a confusing kitchen area. This isn't fun. What was fun; was the hectic nature of quick ordering, cooking food, and trying to get your order out on time. They needed to introduce different food types on normal kitchen environments to increase difficulty. So basically; give me a level where I need to do fish & chips, burgers, soups, steak & fries, salads etc etc... that would be a lot to keep ontop of but in a good way.It's a simple game that was over complicated in a bad way. They increase difficulty in the wrong way and went away from what was fun about the game. I really wish I could recommend the game. If it's on sale for a cheaper price and you are fine to play just the first few hours where the gameplay is strong; that's the best part of the whole thing. As it is; I've quit on the dark level and just found that it isn't fun anymore."

Even with a group however, we've only been able to get to the 35th level or so, it is insanely hard, to the point where one night it ruined everyones mood and we just stopped playing and haven't been back since. An ENTIRE group had this response. The game does a lot to be fun, and the early levels are a BLAST worth tons of laughs. However the later levels are very much designed for players to hurt each others gameplay, choke points and levels that alter in real time seem like fun concepts in the videos, but in actual execution you tend to get really annoyed with the people you're playing with because without being telepathically linked you simply cannot know what every other player is thinking and attempting to do at all times. Still, if you can nab this on a big sale like I did, the two hours of frustration free starter levels are still worth it for a group. We mainly just play this now when new people come over and replay the starting levels. It's a shame that the game kind of ruins its self past that point, but we're still getting our monies worth."

I know you've explained that it is hard and a time consuming process but for PC I can not see the purpose of releasing the game without it. It is in very few occasions that people have the possibility to connect four players on one PC (compared to consoles). I think you should have released this game for the console first and maybe added a multiplayer afterwards with a release on PC.

Given the right parameters, the game could be exceptional but the requirments that need to be met aren't exactly accessible.Even though this game is listed as a single-player game and technically offers a single-player experience, the single-player mode is horrible. When playing single-player mode, you have two chefs which you control and have to switch between by pressing the shift button. This makes the game basically impossible as it takes you two to three times longer to do any task (that is if you can even master playing with the wonky control mapping) and there are no adjustments to make the game more practical for a single-player. It's definitely a co-op game only but like others have said, unless you have multiple controllers or (PC) computers and people in your house that's not exactly viable either. They really should have opened this game up to online multiplayer. Also, I have both Mac and PC but all my friends seem to only have Mac with exception of a few... But they don't live close enough to play so... I basically bought a game I can't really play. I thought I'd at least be able to play single-player but it's just so badly done there's really no point in playing.Pros:-Cute game-Great in co-op modeCons:-Not easily accessible (Mac users, online multiplayer)-Not even a half-hearted attempt seemed given to single-player mode functionality-Keyboard controls are horrid (no option to remap controls unfortunately)-Would need multiple computers and/or controllers in 1 house to play-Too expensive for a game with such limitations on its play"

What I did not know is that it is hard as hell.But not a good hard as hell, but a bad hard as hell:  The controls are too loose.Like, you'll be moving along, you'll aim left, but there is no sharp left, everything is fuzzy and 3d, though there are only actually 4 axises, the game fudges them all, so nothing is precise or contextual.I also bought it to play with my kids.  I thought it would be cute and fun, and instead was stressful and hard to play without sounding mean.  Like, I don't think a cooking game should be all just rush rush rush all the time.  Think about tomato sauce, or some other sauces, you don't cook them in 10 minutes.  YOu stew them in 60 minutes.  I'm not saying that that is critical, but everything also cooks at the same rate, and its all at high.Meh, just doesn't even feel like cooking, feels like a desperate tetris game where you have one arm chopped off, and you've got glaucoma and a 400ms response time like you're drunk at the same time.And the controls don't mention that there's a B button for dashing.  That's never mentioned 0_0.  Wasn't until we were 11 levels in that we discovered we could dash.Tears and sadness, can't really recommend because of the controls and the way they handle.

You can't remap controls, trying to play with a keyboard is incredibly awkward because the use item keys are bound to ctrl and space. My hand doesn't rest comfortably on my keyboard for those keys. This could be forgivable, but the game also doesn't save progress properly, which is really frustrating when you discover you need to restart the game from the beginning every time you play it.

The game is designed require communication and teamwork, which makes for escalating shouting matchesa and maybe the occasional gameplay. It's cleverly designed to force you to work together to win, unlike some games whose co-op modes seem a little shoehorned just for the sake of it.If you have the necessary hardware (including friends) to host a couch gaming session, this game will not disappoint. The best thing about it is its accessbility. Casual gamers can easily relate to the cute visuals and simple, familiar Diner Dash-like game mechanics. Hardcore gamers and senior management on the other hand will appreciate the level of coordination and planning that is required in order to earn 3 stars in the co-op campaign levels.That last comment is coming from someone who has spent around 200 hours playing Overwatch - a highly competitive game that has an optional co-op mode depending on whom you play with.If you are keen on couch gaming on PC, this is an esssential.10/10 if you are into casual couch gaming.##############Key Strengths:############### Accesible gameplay# Cute, stylized visuals# Cleverly designed co-op# Fun, frantic teamwork###############Things to Note:###############AS OF 14 SEP 2016:# Local Multiplayer only.

,Recommended,448510,27374256,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Kasiir,"Equal parts fun and ""make you hate your friends"" managerial nightmare.Overcooked makes for an excellent couch coop where you and your friends try to manage a kitchen and push out as many correct orders as possible within a limited time frame.  While simple enough at the start, the levels quickly grow in complexity as the shapes of the kitchens become more obtuse and the hazards (like rats stealing your ingredients or counters sliding and changing the shape of the map) become increasingly difficult to circumvent.  Deft coordination and communication is necessary to manage the kitchen with 3 or 4 players in these situations, but such cooperation does not come easily.  It can take more than a few tries to get the best rating on every level, which if your friends aren't all on the same page, can make for a frustrating affair.  The light hearted visual style and storyline makes it hard to get mad at the game, but the same can't always be said for your friends...  Luckily, there's built in ""swearing"" and ""punch"" buttons in the game, so they've got you covered as far as venting those frustrations.The game is at its best when you have 3 or 4 people, in my opinion, as much of the resource management puzzle solving is oversimplified with only 1 or 2 playing (although, that can be helpful if you're trying to get better ratings on hard levels).  That said, it can be difficult to gather so many people and controllers locally at times and the game does not currently include online play, so bear that in mind before purchasing.  The game is also fairly short, but like Portal, the experience is unique enough that I think it more than justifies its pricetag.Even with it shortfalls, Overcooked is a refreshing and excellent addition to the couch coop collection and easily earns my recommendation."

I don't know whether that was intentional or a mistake but single player just isn't fun to play and I wouldn't want single player users to have a negative experience to this genuinely fun and chaotic game.I am well aware that this is a party game and the point is to play this game with friends, however not everybody has access to teammate that are in the same room as them, so if you could please adjust single player I would greatly appreciate it tackling this game solo as well as multiplayer.Thank you for this great game!"

Check.Intense? Check.Cute visual? Check.Total chaos? Check.Easy to get into? Check.(this last bit is important so I can rope my less-nerdy friends into it)I was intrigued by the premise (co-op cooking sounds awesome) and the cutesy visual, so me and a colleague of mine decided to give it a try and soon we were totally immersed in the game, yelling at each other. Later on we invited even more friends and more yellings ensued. We played it with 2, 3, and 4 persons and most of the game levels managed to balance itself just fine, so kudos to the developer for that.Another thing to note is the amount of variety provided in the game. I was pretty surprised that each level presented a (mostly) different kind of mechanics that require you to rethink your approach. I still remember the first time we meet the level with the earthquake, we're pretty much in shock when we realized what a mess the level will be.Now, if only more developers created this kind of game.

Lack of online multiplayer makes progressing in the story difficult, as it either takes you forever and a half to get all your friends together enough times to beat it, or you have to go through the campaign single handedly controlling two chefs. The singleplayer controls are not very intuitive and can at times be frustrating, however the game does scale down what's needed to pass the levels if you are playing on your own, which is nice. The graphics are adorable and the game runs very smoothly, would be a 10/10 game if not for the couch-coop only."

Its simple design and gameplay allows for new players to easily step in and have a good time whilst it has a depth that envelops you and moulds you into a better player. The curve of gameplay is suprisingly well ballanced and although you may fail several kitchens when you first encounter them, you always feel like success was just an order or two away.I played this game entirely through coop and loved every second. It will amaze you how fast you can go from being bumbeling and disorentated to playing like a well oiled machine.The only downsides is that the game is incredibly short. Completeing all the achievements (Which includes 3 staring every kitchen) took me and my girlfriend 17 hours playing at quite a lesuirely pace.In short, Its a classic fun game that will challenge and appeal to most players both casual and hardcore. The gameplay is very satifying and the games style is adorable and amusing, But I would say that if you are not into classic ""party"" type games the challenge this game is offering may be not what you're looking for. This game is perfect to drop in and out of but will leave you wanting another fix sooner than you may think. Although a few more levels wouldn't go amiss."

The four of us old enough to play (me, my wife, my 11-year-old and my 4-year-old) have been playing regularly, almost nightly, for the last few weeks. There has been shouting, hurt feelings, blood and tears shed (okay maybe that's an exaggeration), and yet we keep coming back to it. Why? Because in the end, when we finally 3-star that level we've been working on for an hour, the sense of accomplishment we feel as a family is like a drug. We did it! We finally worked together and cooked the hell out of those burgers/burritos/fish&chips! I have to give it to Overcooked, when a pre-schooler can contribute to a game just as much as a  veteran 30-something gamer, they've put together something special.

,Recommended,448510,32164867,Posted: 3 June,all,SketchyGalore,"One of the best couch co-op games I've ever played.Overcooked is an example of a simple idea, brilliantly executed. It takes the familiar concept of a time management game, turns it into a challenging co-op experience, and adds tons of creative twists on the formula.Each level feels like a frantic impossible task at first, then comes together in a satisfying way once you and your friends figure out the best strategy. Better yet, none of the ""gimmicks"" in the levels outstay their welcome, and each of the games several dozen levels introduces something new to deal with.The game isn't without a few hiccups, though. The controls can be a little finicky at times, resulting in (thankfully rare) moments of frustration when you burn something because you can't drop the thing in your hands, or can't get something to land on the right section of a counter. I also had a few issuses specifically on the first and last level of the game with FPS drops (game ran otherwise fine on my semi-old gaming laptop) and audio normalization (I know that meatball's supposed to be loud, but geeze!)But, all in all, Overcooked is amazing. I'm hoping I can leave it on the shelf long enough to forget how to play all the levels, so I can play it again with other friends and enjoy honing my onion choping skills all over again!"
,Recommended,448510,32155290,Posted: 3 June,all,Katosepe,"Check out myself and TB playing through this game on our YouTube channel. Last Boss Gaming:https://youtu.be/TpWKFpWE5dg?list=PL7UoB5kOlDbsMVBbDmuWzKVMrQEgjDsO1Overcooked is a game intended for local co-op. If you don't have a buddy or three to sit down with and play through a game, I'd pass by Overcooked. If you do, though, this game is one of the best you can get. Each level places you in a kitchen with its own bizarre layout and rules. They are easy to understand but tough to master. You and your buddies will have to figure out the best way to cook up the requested meals, serve them, and wash the dishes to get the highest score possible on each level.The gameplay gets chaotic very quickly but levels are bite-sized, usually only lasting 3 minutes, so it never feels TOO stressful. While you are unlikely to ever fail levels completely (you have to basically never complete anything to fail), the game uses a three star system to encourage repeat playthroughs. To unlock new levels, you have to have enough stars on the previous levels. If your goal is just to blaze through the game as fast as possible, this may get annoying at times, particularly near the end when you need quite a few stars to progress, but mastering levels never took too long for us and was always a blast.The whole thing is wrapped up in an amazingly crazy story about an onion king training you to save the world from a giant meatball monster who wants to eat everything, and that's just the first few minutes of the game! Overall, if you have some friends who you can get together to play this, I highly recommend it. If not or if short, stressful bursts of gameplay aren't your thing, maybe join TB and I in our channel for our playthrough!"

My PC was a damn good PC but just under spec for video card in regards to VR so i bought a brand new PC last month and still the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Requested refund about 5 weeks after purchase but they said no.  It took 5 weeks cause i made an honest effort to make sure the issue wasn't my fault which it wasn't but whoever makes refund decisions didn't care.  Now i tried today to uninstall and reinstall but it says ""Update Required"" except when I click download it says ""Content Is Locked"".  So far this is my worst game purchase ever and I buy games more then anybody i know.  E.T. for Atari was better than this cause at least that worked.EDIT:  I was just going to delete the above portion but instead will edit it to be totally honest.  I had issues with the game but i did NOT contact Team 17 about it.  I DID contact Steam for help and they were no help at all.  I eventually fixed my problem somehow and I wish I knew how but I don't.  I think this game is very fun and enjoyable as a co-op experience.  it is mostly about managing space and working together as a team.  Team 17 makes some very good games so I am thrilled that I fixed this one.  I am a cooking game fan and also own Cook, Serve, Delicous as well as Dead Hungry for VR.  This game seperates itself from other cooking games but being a co-op game.  Cook, Serve, Delicious has a 2 player aspect but it is not as fleshed out as this and not quite as good.  I recommend this game for purchase"
,Recommended,448510,31363416,Posted: 25 April,all,RetroMaster,"EDIT: Singleplayer is♥♥♥♥♥♥ You play alone as 2 cooks where you can switch between them at any time. The cutting if ingredients takes much longer than in multiplayer and the levels are equally as hard. Very sad for such a nice game. Create a good singleplayer mode and it will be a perfect game for me!Perfect party game!!!Very good local multiplayer game. Play as up to 4 players, everyone selects a cook and off you go. Set in a kitchen with hazards that get harder every level. You start with the task to cook a soup. All you have is a Stove, a cooking board with a knife and a chest of supplies (Tomatoes, onion, potatos etc.). After you get your first task you have to coordinate together to cook the meal and send it out. While the one player provides the supplies and washes the dirty plates, the other player has to cut and throw the food into the pot on the stove. After it finished cooking you put it on a plate and send it out. BUT CAREFUL! Don't let your food overcook or a big fire will break out wich you have to put down first.Later in the game the levels get significantly harder. Moving tables, flying fireballs and moving ice platforms are just some of the hazards. Coordinate with your team to complete the levels and cook for the FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER, which is your endboss.You can also play this game in Singleplayer but you have to control 2 cooks which is not as fun as it is in multiplayer.Pros:+ Very fun local multiplayer+ Nice animations+ Nice gamepace+ ChallengingCons:- Can be frustrating at some points (gitgut m8)- some little bugs- DLC is not worth the money atm (4,99 for 6 levels)"

It is MUCH more fun if you have people to play with, and WAY MORE fun if they are not naturally good at video games. Just played with my girlfriend, who has played close to 0 hours of video games her whole life, and 15 minutes after starting, I was laughing hard enough for tears as we botched our plans and occasionally lit the kitchen on fire, but we never gave up.. okay, we gave up a couple times and restarted.We plan to put more hours into it tomorrow night."

,Recommended,448510,33882265,Posted: 29 July,all,Rusty,"A fantastically fun and chaotic cooking game. With friends!Overcooked has simple-to-learn controls and mechanics makes it easy to introduce new players into your kitchen; the trick is to work together to orders done quickly.Levels come in the form of different kitchens throughout the game's campaign, versus mode, and additional DLC.With 30+ kitchens, each have their own layout, menu, ingredients, and hazards that must be navigated through, and each kitchen can be played solo or cooperatively.This game was designed with co-op in mind at it's core. It currently only supports local co-op, so invite some friends over and have a ball.Keyboard and game pads are supported, but game pads are recommended (we used PS4 and X360 controllers). The game has a ""split-control"" option that puts full control of two characters on one controller, effectively cutting the number of controls required in half.In terms of single player, there isn't much to offer; you switch controls between two characters while still performing the same number of tasks as a team of chefs. Game time is slowed in this mode to give some wiggle room, but things get overwhelming quickly.Still enjoyable if you're looking for the challenge.(As an additional challenge, use the split-control option to map a second whole character to your controller, then control two chefs in real time.)Having played (and still playing) many hours with friends in two, three, and four player configurations, this is an easy title to recommend."
,Recommended,448510,33866826,Posted: 28 July,all,infestedchris,"The game is designed to stress test your multihandling skills and it does this well. You use 2 cooks at the same time, the levels are some what ""split"" or ""divided"" by tables obsticles and levels that change on the go. As you manuver around the  kitchen, the level will shift and change as you prepare the food and cook the food. This gives the game an added challenge. What makes this even more fun is when you have a friend to play with you to take control of that 2nd cook. The only down fall of this game is that it does not have online multiplayer. This is a big let down because of the nature of how this game is made. Multiplayer is made for this game, because the single player campaign, all though good, can be repatitive and stressful to complete the harder missions. Having a buddy there makes the game flow like a spring river. When a plan comes together and it is executed well. It makes the reward much more satisfying."

Playing this with my friend had been a blast, and would recommen to everybody(ONLY IN CO-OP!!!). The characters are ridicoulus, they look very hilarious. The maps are well desinged, obiously, some of them is harder.Only negative aspect is, that you shall get the two dlcs for the maximum enjoyment rate, but it's only 5 plus euros, worth every cent.Overall, this game is amazing, essential on lan- or couch parties. Worth every cent. 10/10"

76561197975255570,Recommended,448510,34361331,Posted: 19 August,all,oversoul,"A pure split screen couch co-op game. Some thoughts:- I personally love this game. I'll state that first.- I've had mixed success with it. I've now played it with 6ish different groups, and it has about a 50% batting average for whether it was a good experience or not.. It can get very intense, and one individual's small mistakes can doom everyones efforts. Some will not enjoy this.- But... For the groups who do enjoy the intense teamwork needed to run a tight kitchen, there are few better co-op games. When everyone clicks together and the completed plates flow out of the kitchen like melted butter, there is hardly a better feeling and it's high fives all around.- Bottom line: this game is a must own for any serious couch co-oper. Highly recommended."

,Recommended,448510,34499047,Posted: 26 August,all,himirocu,"I would say anyone who has company that is into video games, this is a great buy. The game can be played solo but the fun is getting some friends together and figure out how to get around the roadblock placed in the game (things like slower/faster cooking time or rats that take your stuff). One of the few local co-op team game. There is a versus mode but you still focus on teamwork with your partner."

,Recommended,448510,35141490,Posted: 22 September,all,Miss_duckie,"This is the most chaotic team building cooking game. Imagine you have a resturant and for no good reason, it gets split in half every now and again. Do you and all your team mates end up on one side with all the ingredients but no way to cook them? Or are you cooking everything but can't get any more? With a time limit and a goal of 3 stars its very fun to try to bring organization to the chaos to reach the 3 stars. The different types of worlds are great and the difficulties presented end up being more fun then frustrating.Con to the game: playing by yourself is almost impossible. It is very difficult due to needing to controll 2 cooks with one controller, just switching back and forth."

,Recommended,448510,35038812,Posted: 17 September,all,OneManPosse,"This is probably the worst single-player game ever made, but it wasn't designed for that.  Don't buy Overcooked unless you have friends and plenty of controllers.  If you fit that bill, then you'd be a complete fool to let this one pass you by.  Overcooked is insanely fun with friends; the more the merrier.  It's much, much harder than it looks, but in a good way.  It's not so much frustrating as hysterical; you'll laugh yourselves silly at each other's blunders, and when the kitchen fire breaks out, the ordeal turns into a riotous panic.If you're playing alone, you'd best stay away from this one.  But if you have a few friends, it really doesn't get any better."

Tons of casual and light harted fun even with people who aren't that experienced with playing games. I played this with my GF, friends and family. Game is a huge hit with everyone. Some of the maps can be very frustrating at times not because its punishable but because of how the game decides to punish you. A few questionable map designs and a kind of draggy last match on the campaign  but all in all its pretty fun. Overcooked is a great couch co-op game for everyone."
76561198007429738,Recommended,448510,35271419,Posted: 28 September,all,Malachor,"A ridiculous teambuilding exercise that will probably end in flames.In all seriousness, this game is a lot of fun and a great party game. The more people you can play with, the crazier it gets. Overcooked is local multiplayer only, but it allows you to share controls so two people can share a controller or a keyboard, (I've never tried sharing like that, but I'm sure it only adds to the insanity the game cultivates and it means that the minimum hardware you need for four players is a keyboard and a controller)."
