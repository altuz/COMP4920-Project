,Not Recommended,448540,21929832,"Posted: 19 March, 2016",all,Marlyonama,"Don't be fooled by the trailer and screenshots believing this to be the real deal, because it's not. Theres no story nor are there gameplay mechanics. The entire game is spent wandering aimlessly in a maze until you either run out of oxygen or a monkey kills you with jump scares in one hit.This game also experiences major frame rate drops with ocassional bugs depending on the computer your playing on. That is especially true if your using screen capture software, mine froze up several times. The sound and music is way too loud and there's no in-game option to adjust the volume. Speaking of the lack of options, it has the worst UI i've ever seen for a game menu, theres no save feature, no adjustments, or anything basic that all other computer games have. Stay away from this game, it's a glorifyed prototype and nothing more."
,Not Recommended,448540,23253092,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,CorvusCorax,"To be honest, I did not expect to find a game that is on par with Cargo 3 and Devil's Share in quick succession, yet, I managed to do so. Interestingly, of all 3 this is the one that can be considered the ""best"" as it does not have any floating enemies nor does it give you the impression of being able to make progress while keeping the gameplay very repetitive.Here you do not make any progress. You start out at the very same place in a barely lit maze all the time without any hints as to what happened to you and why you are there. Cargo 3 at least tried to include a ""cutscene"" by including some artwork telling you some basic background story that made you think the devs had spent a decent amount of time with the development. What TL gives you is exactly what the store page synopsis says - no more, no less.While the videos showcase a monkey (in fact, most of the gameplay videos on YouTube have this antagonist) during the 20 minutes or so I spent with TL I only encountered the so-called ""Doctor"" and his ""Wife"". While they look decent their one-hit kill makes the game very irritating and next to impossible to complete (if there's a chance to do any walkthroughs here, that is), yet, the dev (in one of his most recent updates) claims the difficulty is now perfect. Now, this one-hit kill practically consists of a scary voice / sound effect coupled with the close-up view of the antagonist's face who suddenly turns away and is on to his / her business. I guess what they want to say is ""Tag, you're it!"" instead of killing you - either this or another famous playground game is used here: Hide & Seek.You are given a couple of minutes ""free roam"" when there's a sudden music change indicating your dearest friends started coming to look for you. This also means that they will definitely find you - the AI is programmed in a way that it will find you regardless of what you do. Except for one thing - if you hide behind two machines they cannot go into the same narrow space so you're pretty much safe - until your oxygen runs out. If you run this chemical element leaves your body even faster - thank god you can find generators that fill you up quickly.As for weapons: the game gives you flashbangs but using them blinds not only the ""couple"" but also yourself. The effect is a reddish something that can easily make you dizzy. Talk about nausea: since you run out of O2 the sensation of unease and discomfort is just perfect! You also have a torchlight but it runs out of battery very quickly. Quicker than in any other game in video game history. It's a shame as the game is extremely dark.There are some other machines that can be interacted with but I forgot what those were and why I should even be bothered by them. In fact, I had a hard time forgetting about the main menu that pretty much gives all the info you need without any options to offer any changes in audio or graphics. I know it's a Unity engine game and prior to launch you have that pop-up for the changes but what purpose does it serve if you can play the game only on ""fantastic"" quality? So, you only have the ""New Game"" option with also the controls and in-game tips and instructions but written in an English language that will make all grammar nazis stay true to their beliefs. Oh, and there's no pause - hitting esc brings you back to this screen which has constant, irritating music that you (guess what?) cannot turn down or off.Terror Lab offers a short-lived gaming experience with cheap jumpscares and the fact that the developer is constantly trying to let you know that your opinion matters and will shape the game makes you pose the question: Why isn't this still in Early Access? GenomGames may be an ambitious indie developer / publisher company but the fact that they  have released 3 games so far in half a year or so (all with pretty much identical quality / approach) does not bode well.PS: While the great number of positive reviews is not necessarily bad (everybody's entitled to their opinion) what is alarming is that they are too short, far from being factual and there's an odd similarity of their command of English to that of the game's main menu."

Not particularly good, not bad. I don't like that you actually have to turn off the music in game so that you can here the monkey moving.Atmopshere: 6/10 - The graphics and sound do work well together.Gameplay; 2/10 - It's very stale and get's boring very quickly.Scares: 4/10 - The scares are very easy to see, and are very repetitive.Do I suggest this game?: In the games current state, no.

Not only does the game not let me turn down the video quality, but it starts in a 2008 style launcher, giving me little to no customization of the game. Upon entering the game itself, the menu at the start had no choice for any options at all, not even audio (which♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my ears upon launch). Once i finally loaded the game after what seemed like countless screens beforehand, the game actually looked very nice. This however, was just a cover up for a horribly designed piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Taking my first step in the game i knew that the game was going to be dogshit. There was a simulated headbob that was quite unrealistic to real life since i am not a bobblehead. Next, like every other scary game, the lights sudden ""go out"". This is quite unoriginal and i expected nothing less from a 3 dollar dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ The ""scary"" aspect of the game wasn't even scary at all. I encountered the antagonist twice, and neither times did he scare me but I could have assumed this due to the fact that the main enemy of the game is an unevolved primate. All in all, this is the biggest waste of 3 dollars. I would ahve much rather given the money to a prostitue for a hug. Thanks Bernard Nicolas, for making me realize there is something worse than the holocaust. My warmest reguards, BigWeinerJenkins."

,Not Recommended,448540,24273986,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,Yaridovich,"5/10It's... Eh. I'm really on the verge between recommending and not recommending it. I've decided to mark it as not recommended because there isn't really much content and the game's challenge level is mostly a test of patience. As you can see from how many hours I've played this game, it's a test I myself could not endure.I would have recommended this if it was a free game or extremely cheap. While it's not really an expensive game, I can't recommend it at its current price. If you really want to play this, I'd recommend waiting for a discount.Basically, you'll be in a randomly generated area, walking around, finding generators to reset and flashbangs, waiting for a countdown to end so your memory returns, while also having an oxygen meter going (and I haven't really found out how to recover oxygen, I'm assuming it has to do with resetting generators). You'll be trying to avoid three monsters - you know the monkey is nearby because of a blipping sound it makes and you can use flashbangs to slow down the doctor and his wife. Your flashlight depletes quickly - it recharges automatically when it's off, but you'll need it on quite often. And the oxygen meter depletes more quickly when you're running.And that's about it. You just keep avoiding these three monsters, trying to maintain your oxygen level and waiting for the countdown to end. If one of the monsters catch you, it's game over.It's decently scary because you never know when one of the monsters is going to just jump at your face, but there really isn't much content besides what has been mentioned.It seems like the game's being constantly updated, so who knows - maybe in the future things might change and I might be able to recommend it. Not at its current state, however.Also, for some reason, this game causes a very bad coil whine on my PC - no idea why. I've had coil whine from other games before, but so far this has been the worst."
,Not Recommended,448540,33725288,Posted: 22 July,all,Kunovega,"I paid 50 cents for this on sale, which is the only reason I'm not asking for a refund on it.If you pay less than $1 it's an interesting gimmick game, I suppose. But I can't really recommend it, and it's most definately not worth anything close to the $4 regular asking price.This is a walking simulator with jump scares, that's it. The story is one sentence long and you read it off the main menu.You spawn into the game with no memory of who you are, or why you are there, or what's going on. And: there's no way to ever find out.You wander around  a lab in the dark with a broken flashlight that barely works (and only for a few seconds at a time). You pray to find a few flashbang grenades. There's no other weapons.It has an interesting atmosphere to it, but it's a rather small one map game with nothing to actually... do.It seems to want to be a stealth game, but the stealth mechanics are limited to ""you see the enemy first and avoid their line of sight"".If you don't avoid their line of sight, you can flashbang them (if you've found any) or ... they touch you and you die. The end. No lives, no tips, no progress, just dead and start over.Basically this feels like it might have been a tech demo built to show the start of an idea that was never finished. Or just a weekend project by a student game developer learning to use unity assets.If you happen to get it on sale or just want to support the developer who made it (an independant who has made a few other decent games), then more power to you. But it's really hard to recomend this as a game when it feels barely started, let alone complete."

76561198190009994,Recommended,448540,24172370,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,maxattack,"OK, so this game is a bit different, however a great attempt at horror. First things first: VOLUME SETTINGS. I almoast lost my eardrums to this game. Second, the enemies need to be a bit more obvious and have a more sophisticated AI. It seems they always know where you are no matter where you hide. Leading to the third thing, have some dedicated hiding spots that can be accessed by F, which should already be the interact key instead of enter.The hiding spots can be in those lockers so ofen found in the area. I don't know, even make the crouch key useful so we can use stealth. Next, Instead of having all the enemies together in one game (which is VERY overwhelming.) Try making maybe.... say three more monsters and only having one of the six (counting the doctor and his wife.) in the game per playthrough, selected randomly. The last thing I would like to say though, is to have the auto save feature bumped down to every two minutes. Although the game needs improvments, I find it an interesting concept that should really be polished, but would make a really good horror experience."

,Recommended,448540,22228226,"Posted: 3 April, 2016",all,CrapChinStrap,"A nice little jump scare game!When it originally released, it had an unconventional 'on the rails' style of gameplay where you could only move backwards and forwards, whilst trying to fend off a rabid mokey with a flashbang grenade. This was unique and interesting, but also felt very limiting and ultimately the game grew tiresome fairly quick.The game creator took all feedback on board, and promptly worked on improving the game. It only took him a few days, and so i decided to come back and try out the newly updated version of the game.Now it is an atmospheric free roaming survival game, where you have to keep moving in order to not only avoid the rabid monkey, and a zombie-looking doctor, but to refresh the generator and oxygen supply....because if either of them run out, you arent going to survive for long at all.I can't wait to see what further improvements are made to this game, and will definately be playing again in the future!You can check out my Youtube Channel Playthroughs of both the Original and the new versions here:Playthrough Ep#1 - *Pre-Update, old on the rails gameplay*:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYdnjDxO0PUPlaythrough Ep#2 -  *Post-Update, new free roam gameplay*:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExfM33cVGCU"

It takes some getting used to at first in order to get the basic mechanics down and get a technique.

,Recommended,448540,21900479,"Posted: 18 March, 2016",all,wademasquerade,"I have very mixed feelings on this game, so I guess I will just give a list of pros and cons:PROS- GREAT atmosphere. The ""breathing"" effect that the lights have truly create a sense of panic and dread. The sound is great, going from total eerie silence to droning, wooshy, ""something's wrong"" queues.- Very scary. Monkeys are terrifying to begin with to me personally, so to have a 6 foot tall one with red eyes jumping out of nowhere is an♥♥♥♥♥♥clencher for certain.- Visuals (lighting, smoke, etc.) are nice.CONS- Some textures are seriously buggy, and it takes away from the immersion.- That Tocatta and Fugue in the main menu totally doesn't fit rest of the game whatsoever, and I'd suggest something a little more subtle.- While hand-holding is never good, an objective being made clear would be cool.- I experienced a major bug 2 or 3 times where after flashbanging the enemy, my character would be stuck in place, causing me to lose from loss of oxygen. I don't know if there's something I could have done that's not apparent to me, but it seems like something is off there, and it's a total game breaker.In short, it's a great idea for a game, and the atmosphere and premise are right. All it needs is a little tweaking here and there and it could be great! Right now, it's a little broken, which is understandable of a brand new release.Here's my Let's Play! :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99ppATlTNPs"
