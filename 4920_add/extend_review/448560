For example, the one about dice says to click on an adjecent die to ""move"" in that direction. However, the puzzle fails to even tell you what the objective of the puzzle is. I spent ten minutes randomly clicking on dice until I passed (somehow). On two-player boards, the AI plays ridiculously well (and you always play first), so you spend the entire board playing defensively against a tough opponent.Overall, the game isn't fun."

The best exemple to describe this is like ""Take the Tic-Tact-Toe game, write some code that make the AI invincible an then present the game as challenging"". Unfortunately Mind Games starts from a very good and simple ideea but fails to deliver something that is both fun and difficult at the same time. The main complaints are:- For quite a few puzzles the objective is not clearly stated (ex. for Nim levels, it doesn't say what are the conditions for winning - I had to google Nim in order to figure it out)- The AI is ridiculously difficult for the firts levels- The ""Skip"" button is a joke (really?!!!)- It was that hard to provide a way to revisit previous levels? Or it was intentionaly ?Sorry for bad gramma etcThe conclusion: the game should have been polished a litlle bit before release and the description is misleading"
76561198042646749,Recommended,448560,23089524,"Posted: 19 May, 2016",all,kris.aalst,"'Mind Games' is a collection of several brain teasers. You will recognize some of them, while others may be new to you. Look at the screenshots to get an idea of the kind of problems you will be solving. I think most of them are fun, but some are just frustrating. Yeah, I'm looking at you, ""swap the bishops"".Yes, I clicked the button to recommend this game, but just barely. 'Mind Games' has a lot of problems. To be blunt, for the most part it comes across as pretty amateurish:- There is no in-game menu whatsoever. No basic options e.g. for graphics and sound, but also no menu that shows your progress or that allows you to go back to previous puzzles you may want to replay because you liked them. You have three buttons in-game: one to exit mind games, one to show the instructions for the current level on the screen and one to reset the current level. There is also no hint system or another way to progress in 'Mind Games' when you're stuck at one particular level. Well, because there is an achievement for skipping a level I went looking for the way to do that. Turns out the 'hint' you see in the second screenshot on this product page, i.e. ""You can skip the level by pressing left-top reset button 100 times"" is no joke. Not very user-friendly, is it?- The whole audio track is just copied from the game 'The 7th Guest' (also available on Steam). I can't help but wonder if this is even legal, but that's not up to me to look into. But more to the point, 'The 7th Guest' was set in a haunted mansion so the creepy sounds, the ominous music and the maniacal laughter fit that atmosphere. But in 'Mind Games', where you're just solving brain teasers, it feels completely out of place.- The instructions you get for each brain teaser are written in very bad English. Sometimes this causes you to have no clue at all what you're supposed to do and you'll need to figure it out by trial and error, or by looking up the solution on the net, which spoils the fun, of course. 'Mind games' adresses the player as 'my friend', just like in those terrible e-mails you get when buying something from the countries er... 'on the eastern side of the planet' (Russia, India, China, ...). They don't understand the western side of the globe thinks it's weird to call any and all strangers ""my friend"".- Some of the Steam Achievements are bugged. E.g. there are some achievements that require you to complete 40, 100 and 200 levels, but the counters for those 3 achievements is stuck at 6 for me and, according to the discussions forum, for a number of other players, too. According to the same forum, other achievements used to be bugged but were fixed, so maybe the current bugged achievements will get fixed in the near future, as well.So there you have it. If you like challenging brain teasers and find 'Mind Games' on sale, you have little to lose by buying it. But 'Mind Games' really needs some more work to stop it from sticking out like a sore thumb in the huge selection of puzzle games Steam has to offer. Most notably it needs original and better suited music and sound effects, an in-game menu with at least some basic options and a native English speaker to rewrite the instructions which are hard to understand as they are right now."

Wiki and youtube are your friends for this...  I cannot in good conscience recommend this game!Hardest puzzles are the tile picture ones, and the marble one... ofc they're the ones you need to solve for achievements, and the ones with no guides!  I lucked out on pic-tiles, but Marble Puzzle eluded me until a friend suggested a link that helped!For those who go ahead and get this game, for the Marble Puzzle at end, this link is very very extremely helpful:https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/hungarian-rings-sliding-puzzle/Now that it's 100%'ed, never playing this game again!"

They're good for a cheap diversion. It doesn't actually have a level selection screen (at least i haven't found any). Since there seem to be at least 200 puzzles organized into several types, that is quite weird.The game runs well on my old Windows XP computer."

You're basically waiting for the AI to make a mistake in its move, there's no actual way to beat it other than by chance.It's quite ridiculous. Not ridiculously hard, just ridiculous."
,Not Recommended,448560,28132454,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,BluePaw,"I'm indifferent about this game... there's a lot of puzzles, even the start of the game is a puzzle of it's own. There are plenty to solve, and get difficult as you keep playing and solving more, and a few are a mix of other games (Minesweeper + Battleship, for example) however...You don't have control of what puzzle to do, there's no hints of how to solve a puzzle, and skipping is a bit tedious to do (have to reset 100 times to skip one puzzle) which is to encourage you to solve the puzzle instead of trying to skip it.This is more for people seeking a challenge for their mind, not for beginners. Sadly there's no guides to help you out; you're pretty much on your own and any friends who can help you. Achievement hunters beware.There are technical issues too: Every music track is a different theme than the other (and don't loop), you can't go into window mode (even by alt+enter), can't adjust the audio levels in-game, and alt-tabbing in and out can be rather annoying (alt-tabbing in starts a new track and may cause audio overlapping).The quality of the game is mediocre, but the puzzles are difficult and may be frustrating to solve.I'd highly wait for a sale for this game, and wouldn't put it at the top of your wishlist either.Overall: If you're looking for a challenge in puzzles, get this during a sale and no other puzzle game on your wishlist, otherwise avoid.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish."

The downside here is that you have to solve them in order, one at a time.  You can skip one if you're having difficulty or just don't happen to like it, but you have to click a certain spot 100 times.  There is no way of returning to a previously solved puzzle.  It would be so much more fun if you could just pick any  puzzle you feel like doing.  Nevertheless, I recommend Mind Games for the puzzles and the good price."
,Not Recommended,448560,29018935,Posted: 4 January,all,neizod,"the puzzle is either too easy (since you encounter it thousand times like sudoku), or very hard (not your favorite one like magic squeare domino puzzle). that's happen because of scattering puzzles all around, you get to play a sudoku puzzle first, then you're forced to play another puzzle of domino...this is very bad for warpping your mind around one puzzle, once you starts to get acquaintance with some puzzle (and develope some techniques), you then force to stop learning it (and maybe forget it) and play another!so why not just present us one type of puzzle at a time? says, you let me play sudoku for 10 straight levels, then show me another type of puzzle.the quality of ui / programming also pose problems here, likes:- bgm is annoying and not repeatable. so when one track stop, another track comes in and change your mood dramatically.- sometimes, bgm just dead. (then why not make a game w/ no bgm at all? so i can select play my fav youtube playlist in background!)- there is no hint at all! not even a simple warnning like when you play sudoku and accidently put same numbers in a single row. this is not good design aspect for computer-based puzzle game.- and there's also no puzzle tracking/memo, for example, a sudoku puzzle without stat counting that how many number you've put there? so you've to recount it every time you curious have you been crossed out this number?i see the only type of person who would appriciated this game: who've mastered (or nearly mastered) all type of puzzles presented in this game. -- it makes you feel nostalgic.for others who need to play some puzzle game: just buy a game with one and only type of the puzzle that you want to play, you'll build skills on that puzzle more peacefully."

I was mistaken. You don't choose what puzzles you play, the game picks for you. You complete one puzzle to be handed another puzzle with slight description of what the goal is to complete it. It's hard to even skip puzzles and you cannot return to past puzzles without losing your progress.Now, don't get me wrong, I adore challenging puzzles. I just was sadly mistaken about how the puzzles are arranged in this game. I'm the kind of person that likes to pick the type of puzzles I want to do, not have the game pick for me after every puzzle I complete. Some may love this game and I'm happy they do, but this one isn't for me."

However, the experience on the PC is seriously lacking: no menu, no windowed-mode, no level select... There's a pseudo ""skip level"" feature, but it's quite non-intuitive. At least there are some nice achievements... but even those were buggy until recently.Bottom line: i can only recommend the Android version, instead of this one. Though i still hope i will be able to change this review after some major improvements are introduced.PS Their statement in the game description, that ""Only one out of ten people can solve the first puzzle!""... seems completely made up."

I would recommend ignoring the negative reviews, more than a few of which seem to think the early Nim puzzle is impossibly hard.  If you think you would like the sorts of puzzles shown in the screenshots, you will like this game.  If you think peg solitaire is too hard or want totally original puzzles, I'd keep looking.There are a few negatives in fact that there appears to be no way to play in a window and that you can't select a puzzle to play but must play them in order.  Also there are some poor translations in the rules for the puzzles."

There might be an actual pattern, but that doesn't matter, because it can be solved with random clicking.Then the first game pops up. It's a nim logic game, but you wouldn't know that because it has no explanations; no rules, no how-to, just a screen with coins(?) on it. When you figure out you take the coins you select, you notice the computer opponent takes the same number of coins you take in a different row. Naturally, under these conditions you lose very game. There's no real option to skip this game, there's no chance to alter the rules or more importantly, who goes first. It's like you're ten again, you've gone to visit a rich friend who has all the best games. The friend decides what to play, who goes first and has house rules. You don't like it, tough.Mind Games' biggest failing is a lack of fair play which leads to no fun."

They will tax your brain and demand your logic.The game falls down with its interface; there is no ability to go back to a previous puzzle, or have another go at one that you skipped. If you get stuck on a puzzle, you are left with the choice of skipping it (and thus never solving it, unless you start a New Game), looking up the solution on the internet or giving up on the whole game.This is a shame, because it is a fun bag of HARD puzzles, and would benefit from a much more friendly presentation."
