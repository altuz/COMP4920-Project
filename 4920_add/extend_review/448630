,Not Recommended,448630,33921599,Posted: 30 July,all,S0YxSauCe,This is the worst zombie theme game i ever played in the world. Whatever the fk genre this game is. Period. You press shoot they never shoot. You click move they runaway instead. You called that a game mechanic? what a joke. This game is literally unplayable. Screenshot never works only shows black screen. Luckily the dev is even too stupid to fix and patch bug and exploit of this game making it easier to achieve all the achievements with that horrible control and unplayable gameplay. Thats the good news. No I don't recommend this game ever.

I would like to see the developer add at least steam workshop with a map editor so the community can create custom maps, later on add randomized maps, multiplayer and so on. But would I recommend the game? I would, it costs less than a burger and you have a small game that will keep you busy for some time and besides you would support the develop to develop the game further or if not create a better version."

,Not Recommended,448630,31307787,Posted: 22 April,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Casual - Puzzle - VisualAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Flash-Grade Game.You control a few units RTS style and have to kill zombies - and whoever they infect - then you can control the zombies and try to evade the little shooty units. Only about a dozen levels, the concept is okay, but this belongs on a website for free and holds very little entertainment value. It becomes very much a chore very fast, but if you really want to strategize and take this game seriously it can provide a challenge."
,Not Recommended,448630,25809799,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,H3LLxR4Z3R,Pros:-noneCons:-poor graphics-confusing controls with unresponsive units-game opens/closes after every level or restart-no replayability because its not fun-not worth price-difficulty settings make no sensenotes:In what country/universe do police wear green shirts and pink hats?The game practically plays itself at the first setting but then there's no beating it on the second or third settings.
,Not Recommended,448630,24142413,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,jrbviwiz,"*sigh* It's just really annoying... Your police have the worst pathfinding AI, they just walk straight toward the target. Hell, the zombies are better at navigating than these guys (especially when a zombie is chasing them. Hell, then the zombie can even run faster than your guys too...) Also the zombies have way too much health for 1 guy to have any hope of killing them (The Shinning level is impossible...)Not worth $2, if you really want it though wait for a sale (I got it during summer sale in the top-down bundle for really cheap)."

,Recommended,448630,24240299,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,Itohiro,"Good strategy game to pass time. It could be better, but I had fun playing it. Worth buying when on sale.Pros:- Fun- Good difficultyCons:- No tutorial- Menu is not user friendly- Characters are very similar, so it's hard to distinguish initially- Cops have the same velocity or are slower than the zombies, and have extremelly low damage. Quite frustrating, indeedBy the way, I think it would be good to add the option to assign group of characters to hotkeys."
