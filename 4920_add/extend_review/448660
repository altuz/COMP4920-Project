This makes ""What's Under Your Blanket!?"" look like an amazing game.The graphics are ugly. Pixel art isn't automatically good.Everything is ""Lol, so random xD"", that it just hurts.Pressing ""Esc"" closes the game immediately.The gameplay boils down to ""avoid♥♥♥♥♥♥ throw♥♥♥♥♥♥ wait for the timer to run out"".The achievements are really grindy. (I 100%d this game due to a known exploit, which the devs never fixed)If 14 cents is too much for a game, then consider how good the game is.Don't support these people. Just don't. They don't deserve it.Overall:2/10The reason why it's not a 1 is because it technically works."

Your ultimate aim is to try and reward the entertainer with over $1,000 bucks. This is obtainable by collecting score multipliers which appear in the form of falling money bundles with a rainbow attached.While the game never takes itself seriously with grown out loud jokes like free dlc will be available apr1, there's nothing really hilarious or funny about this game. It just seems like a teenage desperate attempt to get his work noticed using goofball ideas. Other than 10 easy achievements the game is 'empty' in meaningful content, which probably perfectly mirrors the developers personality.The only positive thing about the game is that it works, which is not at all comforting in comparison to this games biggest negative which is that the game developer is still developing. Please go back to Macca's and do something meaningful like make me breakfast.https://youtu.be/biTpZCX0gDc"

,Not Recommended,448660,31064659,Posted: 10 April,all,A.,"Oh look, another bad game with negative review all over it,  I tried the game and here's the result.- The gameplay is very repetitive, There is 6 character that you can choose from and there's 6 level. Each level has 2 minute and your objective is to fill up the meter by spamming your money to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you dodge incoming objects and get multiplier to fill up the meter even faster. Each level is just the same with different prositute and backdrops, it's very boring.- There is no level selection. When I need to take a break, I press the pause button in which case, the ESC button but instead of pausing the game, it will exit the game completely. When I reopen the game again, I can see my trophies but my level has not been saved and I need to redo it all over because there is no level selection.- There is no option so I have to mute it manually.- There is a bug when you completed a character at the final level, you will get the achievement for that specific character but assume that you didn't exit the game yet, choose another character and just press play. You will automatically play the last level and when you completed it, you will get the achievement for that specific character. It's kinda buggy but at least you will 100% the game even faster for now.- Trading card is good I guess?? You can make some money out of it.In conclusion, don't buy this game unless you are an achievement hunter I guess."

Do not forget to dodge the worm coming from the ground, he is a multiplier stealer.About the 'scenario', you are just a dude who throws money to a strip-teaser ( do not expect to see something sexy uh ). The game does not need proper explanations.If you came for the achievements, those are easy to get : at first score normally with your first character ( total of 6 ), get the related achievements such as 'score more than 1000 points' etc. One is bugged and  gets unlocked after the first level.Then once you are back to the menu, launch the game with another character, let the game open for 2 minutes ( duration of a level ) and easy achievement.You can also play Gabe Newell.

As my car overturned on the highway, all I can remember is being dragged out onto the lonely road, then darkness. As I open my eyes, I notice surroundings that are unfamiliar to me. It is dim in the room, but I can make out a few shapes in the shadows. I try to move my arms and legs, but cannot. I struggle for a few moments, before giving up and taking note of how cold it is. I try to call out for help, but my mouth is gagged with some kind of cloth. Suddenly, the lights turn on. I look down to realize that I am dressed like a mime from the stomach down, but the bra I am wearing is not mine. I look up and see organs lining the wall, and... Is that a head? Oh my god, I have to get out, I have to get out, I...Oh, thank god, another person! He toddles up to me in a strange fashion before screaming at me to start dancing. Fearfully, I comply. The strange figure, though he is a few feet away, smells awful, his shirt streaked in what I hope isn't feces, his clothing in tatters, dirt caking his skin. His mouth cracks into a smile, his teeth missing. He reaches into his pocket, and I cringe in pain as he starts throwing change at me. The coins bounce off of my skin, leaving small welts, tears streaming from my face. The stranger moves back and forth, as if avoiding some object I cannot see, before ducking, getting back up, and starting over again. Flinching as the coins pelt me, the stranger takes this for agreement, and throws more coins at me. I fear I may die here.2/10."

Well good news is that I did get 3 trading cards. While I knew that the gave was repetitive with only changing graphics, I was still dissappointed by the gameplay. There's not really any explanation of what is flying at you or what to avoid and what to try to catch, what the percent bar at the bottom indicates, or even why bother ducking when the bullets fly over your head. Also from my limited time playing, I do not know if there's a plot, because if so, I did not understand it at all."

This game is all about throwing your money at a woman, dancing on a pole, and avoiding items that are falling from the sky.What your throwing away if you play this game is your time and your fingers from all dat clicking.2. If you think this is one of those cheap tycoon games... Your wrong. You throw money at a woman, you trying to break your right mouse button (because of all the clicking), also trying to get over that %100 (I don't know why they made it)3. APRIL 1ST! WE'RE RELEASING DLC! No... It's over april 1st, and they haven't  yet released DLC. The button on the home screen says 'April 1st', when you click it, it won't do anything. Maybe next year? Next april? Okay, yeah.4. (This isn't a problem) They have as their icon GameMaker: Studio. So, they coded it with GameMaker: Studio? Okay....5. Why the crap is this on a stage? Do people just love a person throwing money at a woman, and why do people throw items on the stage? Are they saying 'SCREW YOU!' 'GET OFF THE STAGE'So, I don't recommend buying this, unless if you want to farm trading cards.... But, the gameplay is bad. 8 bit graphics. But, they lied to us about the DLC!!!

You play with all characters, complete ALL LEVELS , get all the achievements - for 3 of the achievements you must score more than 1000 points - to get Gold, 500 - Silver i think it was - more than 100 for bronze - easy as cake. When you get Bronze, Silver, Gold - you get the achievement for completing with all trophies. So yeah, the game is quite good :D sometimes you may rage a little when you get hit more than 10 times and you also when you GET the money - you must collect fying MONEY, cause you double up your throw of the money - you can make it up to 5x which is quite good, that way you can make 2-3k in no time if you don`t get hit by throwing objects, you must be carefull of one SHOT of bullets - could be 1 or 3 shots, you must bend so you don`t get hit and lose your streaks, there is one little thing like a snake with head of a person, that takes one of your streaks for the money, which is kinda lame, sometimes you can predicts it, sometimes you cannot.  c.c SO YEAH, the game is VERY FUN!Would recommend this game !!!

Now time to try and see if I can get 100 hours. 8/10This game really does tug at your heart strings, the woman doesn't love you, but the cash you throw at her. Those hearts are fake, and so is her love for me. You're paying for premium entertainment, throwing hundreds of dollars away, but she won't even say thank you? You'd expect a lady-of-the-night to atleast have some manners."

Although, oddly enough, my number of silver medals was reset to 1 after that particular update; but not to worry.Kudos to the developer for fixing the broken achievement issue."

I know that when you look at the price of this game and you see money being thrown at a pixelated stripper, you automatically think ""this game is a total joke"".. or perhaps that this game is ""cheap garbage""!It's actually pretty darn fun! ..until you play two or three 'two-minute' games and your forefinger starts to get sore from clicking your left mouse button a few thousand times, lol.Watch my Video Review Right here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s8pZjqbFBMSo you get to choose from a wild assortment of characters before you play by just clicking your character (not shown in my video), and then you must dodge all the dog poop, safes, chickens and other debris being thrown down at you, as well as bullets being shot at you which you must duck under to avoid.  All the while, you are on a two-minute timer to get as much love from that stripper as you can, so you are in a mad dash to hurl cash at her by spamming your left mouse button as fast as possible!  It's actually pretty damn fun for a few minutes at a time, until your forefinger gets numb and/or sore, hehe.The best thing about this game is that if you play this game enough, your mouse-using forefinger just might get as big and defined as which-ever arm you use to fap with!  :-PI gave this game a 69% score trying to judge it fairly in my video, seems like a pretty fitting score.. most of it comes from a higher then expected ""value"" score.  The game surpised me, it really did.  I figured for sure when i bought it that it would be getting a really low score and I'd be leaving a negative review and requesting an 83 cent refund.. but I've decided to keep the game!  I think it will be fun to ""throw some dough at a ho"" from time to time!  :-)  ..In all seriousness, it's not bad."

,Not Recommended,448660,35459349,Posted: 3 October,all,Razonix,"There's really not much to say about this one. What is about? You take control over this dude who's on the stage in front of someone who's dancing, and your main goal is to toss as much money as possible into them (by clicking). While you're trying to do that, you have to avoid random stuff falling from above, bullets coming from the sideways and also this annoying worm from below, everything with your keyboard, while also collecting some value multipliers to make the ordeal easier on your fingers. Depending on how much money you give, you receive a trophy, which only counts for the sake of achievements. The ""story mode"", only has a different background for every level and some other minor changes, and that's it. You can also get to select some different characters to control, and each one of them have their own ""unique level"", but that's pretty much it. I won't say anything about the graphics, because it's usually the last thing that concerns me (fun factor tops everything, after all). As for the music and sound effects, they're simply as basic as possible. I won't deny that there're some positive aspects about this game though: There're trading cards, it's really easy to obtain all the achievements, and the price is low (especially when it's on sale). Overall, if you're looking for a game to have fun, then skip it without thinking twice. If you're only interested in those secondary stuff that I've just described, then knock yourself out."
