,Not Recommended,448780,32797345,Posted: 25 June,all,DiMono,"This is a visual novel that's translated from Russian to English. The translation is ...spotty... as far as quality goes. There are 21 chapters, and the choices you make directly affect what happens in the game. You control which characters live long enough to see the end of it.If you can look past the questionable English translation, the story itself is really quite good. The characters are compelling, the story structure is solid, and there are enough surprises to keep you engaged for the entire ~4 hour runtime. I originally got this at 90% off so that I could flip the trading cards for a few cents profit, but I ended up playing the game through to completion, and I think it was a good choice. Even though there are some random QTEs in it that don't really serve the format.I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but I'm not recommending the game. The reason for that is that at the end of the closing credits, my last mouse click took me to a browser window with one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t survey websites. This is underhanded and despicable behaviour to end a game with, and I will not under any circumstances recommend a game by any developer with the gall to do it.Good game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t business practice. ♥♥♥♥ right off."

,Recommended,448780,32993843,Posted: 29 June,all,LadyLeah,"For $0.06 (equivalent) and with cards? Why not?I decided to actually play it because I was curious about its price/review ratio. I'm a fast reader so I finished my playthrough in under 2 hours (anything more was because I was waiting for the last card to drop).Not sure if there are multiple endings in this game (I got the one whereOleg, Nikolai, and Sergey saved the world and lived to talk about it) but I don't think I'll play another round of this just to figure that out.The story is interesting for a one-time playthrough but the English version has a lot of grammatical errors (and this coming from a non-native speaker).All in all, pretty good value for its price. Recommended if you like Visual Novels and can forgive grammatical mistakes.My Rating: 7/10"
,Recommended,448780,28889529,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Tycho,"ATTENTION!The following paragraph was written after finishing five out of twenty one chapters. To view the review after completing the game, scroll down. There will be spoilers which you may see by hovering over the black bars with your mouse.I've only played up to the fifth chapter (To the first sex scene, and then my mom walked into the room), and I can freely say this game isn't worth 0,22€ I've paid for it. It's worth much more!The story is very interesting, the music is greatly darkening the atmosphere (almost♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself at some point lmao), and the art is just fantastic!Besides the few gramatical errors that the devs are working on, I'd rate this game 9,5/10.And Idon't even likevisual novels.One thing I've forgotten to mention is that this game contains QTEs, or Quick Time Events.Most of the people who play this game might find thisveryannoying, but worry not my fellow Visual Novel readers! QTEs are a rare occurence, and as such there were maybe 10 of them in total.So, without further ado, let's get to..The final review!Short Summary: Your name is Oleg. You boarded a train to Moscow, but around sixty kilometers 'til Moscow, the train suddenly stops and people start dying everywhere around you. You suspect the pink mist that suddenly appeared over the sky.A Visual Novel with very interesting art. People are very realistically drawn, and might I add that some of them look absolutely fabulous (Nicolay and Irene, I'm talking about you!)There actually is one sex scene, so be careful not to repeat my mistake and watch it while your mom is entering the room..The game has actually 21 chapter, so if you finished in, perhaps, 2 hours, then you've made the wrong choice and wouldn't last two minutes in a real apocalypse.Even though it gives you the illusion of choice, usually it's either ""the right choice or the end"".Do not get me wrong, there really are some game-altering choices in it.Perhaps letting that girl Oleg had sex with go to the store? I haven't really tried stopping her from doing so.The game is very depressing throughout the whole playthrough, and I hate to admit that I almost cried at some points.Alexander Petrovich's death had hit me like a truck. I just couldn't believe it - the leader of our group, probably the sole reason we were alive, shot down by a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥criminal?I still regret making some choices, but I refused to go back a few chapters and re-do them. I'll probably never play this game again, as it'd destroy the feelings I have about it.Those were the most well-spent 6-7 hours I've had for the last few years.Thank you, game devs, for this wonderful piece of art.Thank you, for making my life a more tolerable experience.I think I'll go to my room and cry for a bit now."

The game is also filled with QTEs, which will simply end the game if failed. There's two types: press some number of WASD keys shown on random parts of the screen, or alternate tapping Q and E for a period of time. The Q and E ones fail almost immediately."
,Not Recommended,448780,32477153,Posted: 16 June,all,CorvusCorax,"Recent years have seen the release of dozens of visual novels. Among them you can also find kinetic novels - these are generally shorter and give us no option to do any interactions. An interaction here means simply picking one of several (or at least two) choices. These determine the path on which we continue the story. This usually means that based on the choices we make during a playthrough several endings can be achieved (achievements are obtained accordingly).Most of these have an anime theme since they are released by Japanese developers / publishers. The 60th Km is a different one as this comes from a Russian studio. I have already reviewed their awful FPS game titled Red Lake - I decided to give them another chance simply considering a different genre was chosen here.Visual novels usually have an interesting story, great characters and lots of texts to read. 60th Km is a very short visual novel that includes quite many grammatical / spelling errors (this is noticeable even on the store page), a simplistic story with way too many stereotypical characters (I simply believe alcoholism and violence are unnecessarily included in all these tales concerning Russia). Another thing that was - in my opinion - a bad choice is the inclusion of quick time events. These either require you to pick one from the WASD keys or keep pressing either Q or E to win a fight with someone. This is not needed here - it isn't a genre where this makes sense.This is a very short visual novel that tries to do something different but ultimately fails to achieve it. I felt the world realistic - since the anime versions are usually set in a fantasy-like universe - but too simple to be able to attain immersion. I believe this should be skipped and if you are new to visual / kinetic novels try one of the many Japanese classics out there."

There are noises, perfectly fitting into the situation for example.Everything seems harmonic sometimes and can change rapidly into something horrible: Thanks to the good soundtracks.But what I really like about this game (so far) is its story and the multiple-choice-principle.Somehow it is easy to identify yourself with the charcter, maybe because of the multiple-choice-principle.The only thing I do not like at all are the ""Quick-Time-Events"".They are just... not good.If you fail on some scenes, your game failed and thats it.And if you are someone like I am and forget to save the game before heading to a quick-time-event, you can repeat suuuch a long part of the game (if you are unlucky).But, nonetheless, the game is great for its price.It is sad, that the developers do not seem to have produced such a good-rated game again..."

Even at that price I'm struggling to find reasons (besides trading cards) to buy this game.The post-apocalyptic mystery setting could've been interesting, but the dialogue and the situations are not very believable from the get go, and the writing gets especially cringy in the ""romance"" sections. Overall spotty English translation doesn't help either, and to give you a taste, here are some memorable gems:""He is dead""""Nice""-""I understood that I had fainted. My organism hadn't born the tension.""-""there was a fire in the middle of the carriage. It was so big that some of the seats got inflamed.""Graphics range from mediocre digital drawings to stock photos to some combination of the two, and there isn't much in the way of cohesion in the game's artistic style.The game is also filled with QTEs, which will simply end the game if failed. There's two types: press some number of WASD keys shown on random parts of the screen, or alternate tapping Q and E for a period of time. The Q and E ones fail almost immediately, so you pretty much have to know ahead of time if there's this type of QTE coming - which is probably why this game has manual saving.All in all, if you're out to get money out of some trading cards, knock yourself out. Other then that, I struggle to find any reason for recommendation."

That's probably a bigger problem for native English speakers, I'm so used to broken English that I don't let it bother me.

,Recommended,448780,30736447,Posted: 25 March,all,dambuk1,"Weeeeell... that was interesting.First, the bad parts: ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grammar of the english translation and some technical issues here and there. It can get pretty annoying if you are a grammar nazi, but in my case i got immersed in the story enough to stop noticing the errors. Technical issues are mostly occasional lags, and even then happen only if your processor is using a lot of power for other things.The most annoying feature are quick time events... i mean really? In a visual novel? And they are an instant game over without explaining what happened?Thankfully, the story is very well constructed, and the game was cheaper than a potato(it cost 0,09 euro at the time that i bought it), so it's very hard to complain.The postapocalyptic(or present-apocalyptic, since the apocalypse starts during the game) setting is crafted pretty well, though not without plot holes.The characters are neat, the art style is average... not much to say here.The biggest appeal of this visual novel is trying to figure out, together with our characters what's going on and wondering where it'll all lead.Overall, it's yet another proof that a bunch of slavs with a budget of a six pack of vodka can craft a better game than big studios who keep ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out ""Sakura PLEASEJUSTKILLMEALREADY"" titles, without even trying to do a good job."

First, there are MANY grammar and syntax errors, but for me the worst offender are the low quality pictures used for certain scenes of the game. It truly seems like a screenshot from a 240p youtube video.HOWEVER, those are the bad aspects of the game. There are good ones too: if you bought this on sale, the three trading cards you get from the game are worth twice as much as what you paid. The story is original and the soundtrack is good. And the choices you make have a decent impact on the course of the story, but not so much the ending."

But is a great story. Would make a nice movie I say. Music is awesome. Very humble regarding the visuals, but it was made with creativity and good taste. It was interesting enough to not let go till I finished it. So, if you're looking for a game, look elsewhere. If you like a good story about survival and extintion, go ahead and get this.Edit: Just finished the DLC 80-Km. It is really short and adds basically nothing. Maybe is a bridge to a future development, but kinda disappointing, even if cheaper than a bag of crisps. No reason to buy this, stick to the main game I would suggest."

,Not Recommended,448780,33132197,Posted: 2 July,all,MajesticSe7en,"For a genre that relies heavily on story, you'd expect the story to at least be followable...The text quality, which is very bad, detracts from the experience heavily. From what I have read, the original Russian version is also erroneous, which adds to my opinion of the game being just plain lazy.The art style is heavily inconsistent, which is visible from the screenshots on the store page. Drawn characters are accompanied by real images, which occasionaly have artsy filters over them.There is very little interaction at all, and the QTEs are just annoying. Any choices you make when prompted do not matter, and I have experienced this even while playing for a short time.Examples that I have experienced:-One character asks you which character you think is responsible for their situation. He will attack the WRONG CHARACTER, and is forgotten about a few chapters later, despite being dangerous-No matter what you do when your character is hallucinating (run, stay still, or pull out a gun), your character is still described as pulling out a gun on your friend. The ""choice"" only minorly changes text-In the part where Marina is kidnapped, if you say no to going to rescue her, you will have to go anyway. If this isn't bad enough, considering the game tells you that you have the choice to save who you want, your character will speak as if he was the one to discover her, despite not being the one leaving-The romance with Marina, despite me blowing her off each time on the train, our characters both apparently care about each otherAll other choices only matter for the current moment, never being brought up again. One of the best interactions in the game is a quiz of sorts, to make sure you were paying attention to the characters. Too bad it only happens once, and has no connection to the rest of the story...Ultimately I would not recommend this game. Even at a discount price it is simply not worth your time."

However, after some chapters, the story becomes redundant and the many typos become a problem as it is sometimes hard to understand clearly what is being said.In my opinion, the game had potential but it became a bit dull because of the characters lacking some depths. They all ""are hiding something"" but it turns out, you don't even want to know what exactly. There are way better visual novel games out there but if you are not too demanding, it might do the job for you."

Characters don't show any emotion or reason to be there. Spoiler alert you can't go out because of pink fog and coincidently there is a man with gas masks. There was no need for him there and if he was transporting new prototype gas masks then wouldn't he do it in private transport. At one point you have the option to see a nude girl for no reason. No context just there. Majority of the gameplay is reading the story. This game basically is a miediocre book with a small amount of options which most of the time don't change the story or it's just a matter of whether someone dies or not. Refunded. I always try and hit the 2 hour mark with games and I  would say that I'm usually quite generous when it comes to reviews. And this game claims to have full english support but I oftenly encountered spelling/grammar mistakes. And don't get me started on the save system. Not only is there no autosave the screen is a mess.

There were also some things which as a non-Russian person I didn't really understand, but they didn't detract from the game.Honestly I only recommend this game if you can get it for 10 cents.

,Not Recommended,448780,33328624,Posted: 6 July,all,MiauTheWorld,"Well, I'm gonna try to say the worst in the best way I can. I really don't understand how there are good recomendations for this game, unfortunately. I won't play this ever again. Thankfully I bought this on the Summer Sale and it costed only 20 cents.- Terrible HUD/Game Interface in general. Menus are not ""simple"", they are poor. Lacking a better layout, sfxs and such.- Considering this is a Visual Adventure Game, reading is the most important thing. But, there were a lot of problems with the text: Bad margins, font choice, size, typos, grammar erros, bad spelling or just sentences that feel weird. The Quick Time Events (having to push buttons quickly) are a nice approach, but they feel boring.- Like someone said in another review, the character design really look like people from WikiHow. I don't blame the devs for not knowing how to draw, since this is perfectly understandable, but since they were mixing drawn characters and photos, why not just use photos instead? I think that would have had a better result- The story is not that bad, but the storytelling has a lot of fails and the plot sounds childish sometimes... The idea of the fog being able to enter buildings and stores but not being able to enter > specifically < moving veicles is so convenient that is not even plausible. Even the sex scene feels weird and out of place. But the thriller was fine, I guess, I kept playing until the end.- The OST could be more diverse. There are a lot of times that plot suggests suspense and thriller but the music just don't match the mood, or even the opposite - the scene is calm, but the music is tense.Well, even with this negative review, I really hope the devs can learn with their mistakes and make better games in the future! Making games is not easy and simple, and takes a lot of time and effort! :)"

The story was quite interesting and full of suspense. I was not a big fan of those ""hit the keys shown on the screen"" sections. They took away from the immersion and were unessary. Luckily there are only a few of those sections. The game contains quite a few spelling and grammar mistakes but I'd argue it even adds to the Russian vibe of the story."

Non sono sicuro ma ho l'impressione che a seconda delle scelte che si effettuano durante il gioco, possa cambiare il finale ma è solo una mia impressione.Comprato a 0.09€ in saldo, è stata una sorpresa perchè non pensavo fosse cosi coinvolgente.Dura circa 2-3 ore.Sconsigliato a chi si annoia a leggere dialoghi in inglese per il 90% del gioco senza dover interagire con mouse/tastiera."

Jokes aside, this game is a must havePROS+ Good story+ Olga+ very mysterious that you are interested at the very start+ Bad♥♥♥♥♥grumpy man who gaves you his gun+ awesome+ boobsCONS- Some characters are not necessary and just a fillers (they even beat the fillers of naruto anime)- If the user finds an action or action interactive part, pressing w,a,s,d,q and, e won't do good- Marina JoyceVerdict: If a fan of apocalyptic novels or just for the sake of mystery♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is so damn good, wish this game was a triple A game so it can have a better engine to promise us.Rate: 8.5/10"

With the standard price being 90p, I'm thought the game would be decent at the most. But I was wrong. The game is, surprisingly, a very good game. The ending is decent. I haven't tried out the DLC. Would recommend."

I'm all for a good story, and the storyline seemed like it was gong places, I just prefer games that are alot more interactive. Rather than clicking through a novel, and hitting random key combinations. It's all just photos with words.Again, it's not my style at all."

Think about reading a short story, with background music, and the ability to interact with the story affecting the outcome of the same. The translation is still far from perfect, but it’s a work in progress by the devs.Overall:[spoiler♥♥♥♥♥♥BLYAD[/spoiler]/10Recommended. :)"

With the bombs n' stuff.""Well here it is. Boom your stranded in a train and very confused. And you'll probaby cause someone's death. No contact with the outside world. Who will live and who will perish?

The translation was a noble effort (IE, not very good, though intelligible), and it only took a very little mental gymnastics to get the story. The sheer number of branching storypaths are awesome. I'm looking forward to playing some of their other games (which I got in the bundle).Bravo, guys."

I didn't expect a lot from it, but it's way better than i thought it would be. The English translation is really poor and sometimes barely understandable, but still, the story and the characters are way more interesting than some of the AAA point-n-click games (*khm*TWD S3*khm*)."

76561198271097277,Not Recommended,448780,34090896,Posted: 7 August,all,TheQuestion42,Rate: 5/10I'll be honest: I like the game mechanics and  the theme of this game; it's also good that in-game choices do matter to the story because it makes this replayable. But the writing is very loose. For instance: characters are not developed and that makes their choices and personalities look random. On more that one moment the game took me out of the story because the inner logic of it all wasn't set all that well.

,Recommended,448780,34060165,Posted: 6 August,all,my girl like mastrubate to me,"This game is just like a book, with own decisions and background music.It`s a story, but you can decide which way you want to go, which makes this game really intresting.I played it one time now, but I think I will play it another time, to see, what i can do else in there.As I said, that this game is like a book, most of the time you will spend to read the story. But it's still intersting and the background music make it even better.I really recommend this game to people, who loves storys and likes reading.A negative side I need to say, that the english translation isn't really good. You can understand everything, but there are often mistakes made while the translation and the writing.All in all the 'game' is really good for it's price."
,Recommended,448780,35014865,Posted: 16 September,all,tenchimuyo1990,"I was hesitant when i started the game. It came with mixed reviews and the English translation was not perfect by any means.I got over the translation quickly and found myself glued to the screen to find out more of the pink fog mystery and to find out more from the other characters.A runthrough took me 4.5 hours and I didn't feel swindled.*notes*The art is a mix of photographs with drawn humans and objects.The music i didn't feel was amazing, but wasn't offensive.There are multiple ways for the story to end other than the random deaths throughout the game.There are a few interactive events which involve clicking certain keys.Multiple choices in the game which can result in death of the main character, other characters, different dialogue and the games ending.Glad to have played it, will probably pick up the DLC"

,Recommended,448780,35249963,Posted: 27 September,all,Arrowdance,"I finished the game, and I made a blind gameplay in my YT channel:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo3Hag02Z5GY998nDWtn7gxN7c49DeKHuAnd well,  this is my review (SPOILERS ALTERT):I got this one in Steam Summer Sale, I was looking for interesting games, and I found this one. The reviews made me interested to get it, and it was very cheap, so yeah!The animation and the interface of the game is very simple, and when I was playing it, the story started to grow  on me. And the cool thing I love about this, every choice you make, the story could change around you.At first, you control a guy called Oleg(you'll know his name until the chapter 3), so you follow him in his adventures with all people inside the train that got stuck in the 60th kilometer before they arrive to Moscow. Your decisions will form his personality and how the other character will interact around him. You could get very interesting scenes in some points,for example: A russian song from a band called Second B (it's the first time I played a visual novel with a song in it), some sex scenes hahaha (I didn't expect to get the 1st one, I thought it'd be a romantic moment or something, you could tell in my blind gameplayand also, your decisions could change the fate of some of the characters,for example: In the part when Marina ask you to let her go hiking or not, she could die if you choose the wrong one, and if she lives, Alexey and Olga will have something. heheAlso, you will have to press buttons in the keyboard in some points, for example, to open doors, runnning, etc. You will just need the WASDEQ buttons.In the middle of the gameplay, you'll control a guy called Sergey Vitalievich.You will play as him in the chapters 8th and 11th, and you could see this guy, on the contrary with Oleg, you'll never see how he looks. His story happens with some people inside a bus. I remember the explotions scared me lol.Anyway, you will control him just in those chapters, because our hero is Oleg. His story is a bit similar, but short.You will return to play as Oleg, and finished the game with him.Now the ending:The ending is a bit weak,  I didn't expect it, you could tell in my blind gameplay, but the part when Oleg was fighting against his hallucinations and reality, was very interesting and deep. Of course, he wasted time to stop the pink fog, but when he had to fight and believe it was just his imagination to do not get crazy or something was very interesting for me. The final part when Sergey, Nicolay and Oleg gave up because they thought they couldn't stop it, it was sad for me, I thought I messed up the gameplay, but I was happy when I realized they did it! And the text just telling you what happen to all the world after the pink fog disappeard, it was pretty simple, I didn't expect that, I wanted to know what happen to our friends in the bus and the train, anyway.The story and the characters are very well made, to be honest, some parts made me feel concerned and also I felt bad when some of the characters died.Like Alexander Petrovich, I felt bad for his death, but you can make him survive, I'll upload a bonus episode in my channel about that.IMO, the story could be a very good plot for a movie or tv series. It'd be awesome.The music is nice. After I finished the game, I was looking for the soundtrack, and I realized they used free music, for example: Ether - Silent Partner (the main theme), Huma-Huma - Nevada City, The Bluest Star - The 126ers (Marina's theme song lol), etc.The animations are very regular, but well, what do you expect? For the price is acceptable. And I think they used like 2 different kind of animations. You'll notice this when you reach to the 2nd part of the gameplay, for example in the story of Sergey.There are some parts that were bad translated, even when they named the end of some chapters. For example, when I finished the chapter 20th, the translation it says ""The end of the twelfth chapter"".There are some bugs I notice. For example:In the part when Oleg and his friends arrived to the bus where Sergey and friends were, Olga will ask you to go to fidn those guys in gas mask, if you refuse, she'll go with Alexander, and when he returned in the chapter ""The Rescue"", he will tell you that they kidnapped her, he will ask you to go with him to rescue her, if you go with him, for a strange reason, Oleg will return to the bus and tell people inside that Olga got kinapped. lol In my bonus episode I'll show you that part.In conclusion, this visual novel is pretty good. The story, the characters and this cool thing that every option you choose, it could change the story and the fate of some of the characters, it made it awesome. I'd love to play it in the future. I highly recommend it to play it. If you love visual novels with interesting plot, this is for you! Thanks to the guys of Talentplace for creating this cool game. I hope they will fix the bugs in this game and I wish them the best for their future projects!"
