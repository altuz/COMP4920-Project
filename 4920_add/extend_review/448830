,Not Recommended,448830,21711123,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Reading Rambo,"I like the idea of a program like this, but this is poorly executed. The sounds loop with very little variation after a few seconds of playing, there's a lot of definitely-not-ASMR sounds in here (and very few conventional ASMR sounds), and there's very little ability to customize the sounds to something that resembles ASMR. This project has potential, but until it reaches that potential, this program is not worth the money."

I like the idea of this program, but it's lacking at the moment. There needs to be far more options for the actual ASMR sounds. I would even go so far as to say that the sounds that are not ASMR-y should be removed (fire alarm, for example, is just annoying).Perhaps if there were more scratching sounds, tapping sounds, kissing, mouth sounds, some sk-sk or ks-ks, rubbing sounds (rubbing the mic, etc.), buzzing sounds like hair clippers/trimmers, low humming sounds like an AC unit or something, stuff like that.Again, I like the concept, and I do recommend it, but it could use more sounds before I'm going to say it's actually good."
,Not Recommended,448830,24309719,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,TheTopMostDog,"For the people not fully understanding what this is, it's simply a digital sound looper and mixer with some built in sounds.Sadly, I think you're better off looking into free ones on the android store. Look for ""relaxation sounds"" or ""mood sounds"". The one I use is called Relax Melodies.This one has a few good sounds, but most are unrelated to relaxation and, to be frank, are quite obnoxious. The UI is about as advanced as my middle-school web design and the sliders for pitch and speed simply don't work properly- and even if they did, they don't really have a place in the design, as it just warps sounds to the point of irritation. Is this for making music or for relaxing sounds? Pick one and stick to it, or seperate the two and have two projects.I will not be refunding as I see the potential this has (just look at how popular rainymood is) and I would like to see where it goes.For the developer:I think you need to invest in some quality nature sounds and incorporate good, faded loops.Improve on the UI by utilizing drag and drop and let us link things in a chain to create a type of playlist; multiple chains playing consecutively and looping at different times would produce a more natural sounding experience.Add a tutorial for people just opening it (I understand HELP is there, but it just feels cheap).Setting up some pre-made saves would help show off what you can actually do with your software, too. You could have one of them present on the screen when you open the software for the first time. Edit: The intro music, if you leave it at the title screen, is a good example of something that should be on the board when you first enter the software."

I expected too much. There are very odd and not calming sounds on here such as barking dogs, sirens, loud bass, screaming, etc. The sounds that are calming have noticeable loops that disrupt the experience. I'm sure this could be a good program for some, but it wasn't for me."

,Not Recommended,448830,28982046,Posted: 3 January,all,Bodomi,"I mean... I get it, but I don't.Instead of being a game, this is a program for whatever reason.It is a simulator, if anything.It is a...program... where you select different sounds, individually change their volume, pitch and speed.Once you're done you save that and you can load it and play it.That's it.Also, why does the list of sounds include screaming noises, baby crying etc...?These are not ASMR sounds.And as for the actual ASMR sounds that are in the game, I mean program, there are barely any.It needs a larger library of sounds.I get what it's supposed to do, and I guess it does it; I.E induce ASMR.But you can just search forTapping ASMR, for example, on YouTube and get a thousands times more content for a thousand times less effort.Not worth the money or effort.*Oh, and the opening screen of the game includes seizure inducing flashing colours.Great for ASMR.Just thought I'd let you know."

It's full of potential, but none of it is tapped.After I took a sound from 1,001 Sony Sound Effects and rendered it as an ogg in the programs custom sound folder with SpectraLayers, I found the ASMR program loaded the file once I ran the program again. However, my college teacher used Vegas Pro for his audio editing for his radio show for years, and those same 1,001 Sony Sound Effects load into Vegas Pro without conversion, so... my flip just flopped.  This software... is full of potential, but without proper and convenient export and import options, it just isn't as good as a cheap sound effects pack from Sony and a multitrack audio editor of choice, which may simply be the free Audacity."
,Recommended,448830,21784149,"Posted: 12 March, 2016",all,baby shiba,"Eh, there's a lot of room for improvement. It's not terrible, but a lot of the sounds here definitely do not fit for ASMR, such as the car horn, the scream (?), and others (Though I suppose they can be useful for other creative needs).Now, I feel the sounds are useful for general relaxation, but for the purpose of ASMR specifically, very few do the trick. This software does have quite a lot of potential though. I'd like to see it developed further, as I really do like the overall concept here."

,Recommended,448830,22349056,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,SlaterDies,"Pretty cool idea. Some of the worst UX. When you click + the node goes directly under the plus... would be best to have it surface in the center. Right-click deletes sound... so don't accidentally do that. You'll confuse nodes with sounds. Save, Help, and Load are click for show/hide. After playing with UI, you'll get used to the weirdness... none the less idea is very cool. With a UX/UI update this thing could be a huge hit. The animal in the center has a white halo around the image because someone barely knows how to use Photoshop. All that being said, it's pretty amazing."

I was left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed by the inability to exit out of menues, the odd choices of samples and no way to share my experience. And then I realized...This is one of the best horror experiences ever and it is hilarious and fantastic. This thing lets you create a waking nightmare. I only wish I could share my creations.The save menu is wonderfully stupid and underthought. I had to scroll down to find my save files, they were saved in unnumbered slots. Diabolically thrilling.We need to start a community sharing the triggers this awfully fantasic game offers."

This.In all honesty is a pretty awesome program but wish they had more sounds or ways to import your own or ways to create your own. For about $3 it's not bad; I've spent more on worse.
