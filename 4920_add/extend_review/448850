Thats all I needed. Actually going through the training level is all I needed. This game is EXACTLY what I wanted in a Descent game. Such a simple formula, which I've never seen perfectly replicated by any other publisher. After nearly 20 years of waiting.......... all I can say is it felt like I went straight back in time to 1996. Descent 2 was one of the first PC games I ever played, I loved it then and still love it now. I hoped that Descent Underground would be able to bring back that feeling of nostalgia but they have failed. When I saw that the original creators were involed in this.....what seems as a spiritual successor to the Descent series, well all I can say is that I've been sitting in front of my PC waiting for this to unlock early access. I don't regret waiting. First time ever I haven't regretted paying for early access to a game, even though it is just one demo level. You can tell straight away that this game has the original creators fingerprints all over it.Pros:The fluidity of movement (if you're Descent fanboy like me you muscle memory will kick in split seconds),the electronic soundtrack (which you think wouldn't be an influence but for me its a big deal),gameplay itself hasn't change from the originals which makes it so good.Visuals are pristine,AI, holy sh*t! first time I actually felt like I was being hunted. Very few games I've played where I  actually had to flee for my life.Cons: (there are some which are minor, really not worth mentioningIs there a guidebot?Thats it, if you've read this far my question to you is, why are you still reading and not purchased? And this is coming from someone who is firmly opposed against purchasing early access, DLC, season pass which are blatant cash grabs.To the creators, you made a mid 30's gamer feel like a teenager again. I'm home! Thank you very much! :)P.S. I come back from time to time to see if there is any updates which there has been. So I played the second or third level. Yep, did nearly jump out of my seat when I pretty much flew straight into a trap. And another addition to the game which brought a smaile to my face: When exiting it has a little cutscene like the original Descent of you flying out of an exploding tunnel. HAHAHA nice work boys. I'd laugh if your character is called defender of material. THIS IS DESCENT 4"

After playing for 30 minutes, all I can say is THANK YOU. I can't wait to get a real joystick and relive the good times.This game feels so much like Descent, but looks like you would expect it to look for a modern game. I'm already wanting some good ol' PVP and PVE with a map as fun as all the Minerva maps from back in the day."

The pumping adrenaline, frantic manuevers, blazing guns, and devilishly clever and aggresive AI.The first time I fired up Overload and peered into those dark caverns, desparately trying to discern where that evil throbbing was coming from, I was instantly transported back to those suspensful moments in the first two games.Returning veterans will find familiar yet fresh enemies, weapons, and upgrades. Newcomers will find a slick and addictive zero-G dogfighter, though you may need to take some dramamine on your first ride."

I remember installing the free multiplayer demo on my high school network drive and completely derailing entire class periods in our ""Computers"" class. Absolutely beautifully re-created. You can tell that the devs love the game, and want to hold to its original spirit while adding balanced improvements. Levels, weapons, soundtrack, and even settings thus far are all a joy. I love that more difficult game modes do not just dial up the enemy armor 500% and triple wave density. Soo excited for the final release, but thrilled that the devs are making meaningful ~monthly releases. I honestly haven't knowingly experienced a single bug, outside of one black screen launch, which was easily recovered from with the super-thoughtful launch option for recovery. If anyone is on the fence about re-living their gaming adolescence in HD, just do it, and I'll see you in there once multiplayer opens up!"

,Recommended,448850,32738762,Posted: 24 June,all,Svenski,"I only needed to play this game for about 15 minutes before my muscle memory was back from 1995.  Plays and feels EXACTLY the same as legacy Descent 1/2, except much more streamlined features and absolutely BEAUTIFUL and CLEAN graphics and interface.  The weapons are definite improvements over the original descent designs while being somewhat familiar in feel.  You can tell they've tapped into modern computing power which enabled some more advanced mechanics and visuals.  THIS is how video games were meant to be played.  Nobody to this day has made a combat game like Descent EXCEPT for this team, and this title perfectly brings back the complete smooth 3-dimensional control combat mechanics.The biggest CON for this title at the moment is the utter lack of multiplayer PVP (local LAN support especially important for those 90's Descent fanboys out there).  I read that they are promising a multiplayer expansion in 2018.  I can't wait.  But I guess that gives me plenty of time to grind through the single player content up to the highest difficulty.Good luck dev's, stay vigilent, keep up the excellent work.-CCBB"

As it stands, it is an excellent successor of Descent.The game plays just like the original: Navigate 3D environments in a space ship, collect items and weapons to progress, blast robots to bits, and then blast the reactor to bits... oh, and escape, or you'll also be blown to bits.The individual robots are very smart, especially in the challenge mode. They'll go and cut you off while you are running through a tight corridor, hunt you in packs, approach you from behind and grab you... The fights are really tense, especially on higher difficulties.The graphics and the overall design is a win as well. The environments are detailed enough to be attractive, but simple enough to be navigated. The levels look distinct from each other, but a little bit of ""same"" feeling *may* be there, perhaps after a quite while of play time. I connect this issue to the state of the game right now, as there are not much levels yet... and these levels are very well played, I never felt bored in repeated playthroughs. In fact, their pace is so frantic, especially on higher difficulty challenge levels, that one doesn't think about graphics that much.The individual robots can be recognized at a glance, and the damage system is ok (maybe you can dismember the bots, without destroying them? Imagine a bot, which has one arm destroyed and is also on fire, doing a kamikaze...). They feel quite different from each other: the little pesky ones, the big bad rocket platforms, the maniacal Shredder with its charge attack and distinct scream (which will be in my nightmares, along with a certain bot from the first Descent. You know which &%+ Wheeezer I'm talking about.). Excellent work.The weapons are designed well so far, and they are very fun to use. They have distinct strengths and weaknesses, making them situational weapons: There is the starting laser, dealing low/moderate damage with moderate firing rate, a few shotgun-like guns using matter or energy for close quarters, a charging weapon that deals high damage with low refire, dumbfire missiles, homing missiles, missile pods that fire tons of missiles very rapidly, mines that are excellent for shooting around that corner, and that big one going with an extra-large kaboom. And there is yet to come (I'm sure they will be great and tested well, without being TOO annoying, right? RIGHT?? I'm looking at YOU, designer of those !&% HOMING FLASH MISSILES!!! My EYES man, HAVE MERCY! - Good programming, by the way). You can try each of them in challenge mode, where you are dealt with different weapons each time you start a new game...Speaking of weapons, you can also ""Bump"" into the robots, like a melee attack. You can finish off weakly arnored bots like this. You can also use this to gain an additional boost as you are boosting. One thing, however, this bumping ""locks"" into the nearby enemies, which isn't good if you are trying to dodge them - you get smashed right into them instead, sometimes with additional bots surrounding you. I'd like an option at the very least, to turn this locking feature off, we can smash our way without it.One thing I noticed that the environment doesn't get damaged...  Granted, we're in early access, so this aspect might be added later. Still, I looked for destroyable screens everywhere...The interface is great, you can tell your ship's status at a glance. Only a minor alteration I'd suggest, maybe a bit larger fonts, especially for the central armor counter near the reticle... It is somewhat hard to read :)EDIT, 20.03.2017: Re-reading this, I realize I forgot a major part out: The sound and the music, and both are over the top. The sound design is fantastic: the weapons sound deadly, and the robots sound even deadlier. The only nuisance was the automap on/off effect, it sounded a little too close to an actual robot hunting you...But the most shining thing in this game is the music, with the one in the 4th challenge map (Centrifuge) being my favorite. In fact, I played that challenge map over and over, just to keep listening it :).Overall, the minds behind the game are putting up an excellent job. It is expected, since it is a team of veterans, the creators of the original game(s), as well as great mission sets for those games. I'm confident that they will keep up the good work, and I cannot wait for the rest of this game's development... especially THAT level editor!I recommend this game with confidence in this team. Godspeed, Revival productions!................................................STILL READING??? WTF ARE YOU DOING, GO GET THIS GAME!!!"
76561197997521492,Recommended,448850,33858418,Posted: 28 July,all,Personicus,"After having racked up almost 130 hrs of Overload game time since around mid-April, I thought I'd take the plunge and provide a few lines and share the love for this title. I'm not, and never was, a ""Triple-D"" (Devout-Descent-Disciple) - I admired the concept, but simply didn't fall in love with 6DOF back in the 90's.There are enough reviews from ""Triple-D's"" here on Steam as well as the Overload forums, that virtually everything positive about Overload has already been said - so what can I add as an apparent ""pagan""?For those gamers that perhaps have either never indulged in a 6DOF affair, or have dipped their toes in, but found the temprature somewhat uncomfortable, Overload is a breath of fresh air - because it works flawlessly and is absolutely accessible in a very minimalistic way ! When it comes to gaming that involves wreaking explosive havoc on any form of enemy by means of an impressive incendiary arsenal, there are some critical factors that must be in place to hook me and keep me coming back for more: minimal time spent in config/setup menus, pitch-perfect and responsive controls, ambience and immersion (art-style, sound, lighting), simple and compelling gameplay. I was having fun with Overload within 10 minutes in much the same way that ID games captivated me back in the 90's - all of the ingredients were there!Challenge mode alone is currently worth the price of admission, although the MP component (available in 2018?) will hopefully provide a few game modes similar to UT3 (i.e. bot matches) thereby providing eons of fun for years to come.Again, for anyone relatively new to this genre, but with a love of FPS's, this won't disappoint, especially given the support  for various control devices ! You certainly don't need to be a ""Triple-D"" or a flight-sim genius to enjoy this high octane, easily accessible, addictive arcade shooter and at this point, it's hard to pinpoint any significant negative aspects of the game.UPDATE 08 SEP:There have been a few build releases in the interim adding new weapons (timebomb), new CM maps (Blizzard - probably one of the best thus far) and overall game balance adjustments (some good, some not so good) . Overall, still highly recommended, although it's likely that a truly well balanced and well honed CM mode won't be seen until much further along in the dev cycle."
,Recommended,448850,30489364,Posted: 13 March,all,[LB] blaknite,"A faithful recreation of Descent with VR to boot.I'd played the demo a while back and was eagerly awaiting this to launch on early access. Now that it has I'm quite happy with what I see so far. As with anything you jump on board with this early it's lacking content but the game itself seems quite polished.So what's the bad? Mouse sensitivity was way too extreme for me, I had to set it all the way down to get anything remotely playable. Was glad to see my expected keyboard/mouse binds were all in the familiar places though.What's the good? Holy hell was the the intense VR experience that 10 year old me dreamed of when he heard the original Descent had VR back in the 90s. Explosions in your face, rockets and lazers flying everywhere. It's epic! I was afraid I would get mad motion sickness from it but I pulled up reasonably well. Not for those susceptable to VR sickness though.Overall this is one I'll be watching closely throughout it's early access period waiting for a full campaign to land."

I do.Some context -  I'm an old gamer. I'm an Elite Dangerous early backer (to recapture Elite from back in the BBC micro days). I also backed ""Descent Underground"" for the same reasons - nostalgia - for the days when low-ping-bast*rds and modems were a thing.A while ago I re-bought all of the original Descent (1/2/3)  series (ty GoG) hoping to enjoy the replays. - Sadly, in my eyes, those games are just too dated on modern hardware.This version, by the original Descent crew, has entirely captured the original feel, and If I'm being honest, more so than the similarly named 'Descent Underground"".I'm looking forward to the full version and wondering what mutli-player is going to feel like.Come on guys, you kinda/sorta have the mass-driver, now bring on the MegaMissile. quad lasers, fusion cannon and lets not forget the vauss..

I ended up purchasing the game as soon as I played through the demo level for the first time.  Twas love at first play.The controls feel great.  The level design is great (from what i've seen so far).  The map design is great (seriously, this is how you make a player map).  The sound effects are great.  The music is great.  The enemy design is awesome.  The weapons feel really meaty and fun to use.  The game overall just FEELS good, ya know?  Doesnt hurt that it runs flawlessly on my rig.  Maybe I'm hitting the nostalgia feelings hard, but I am in love with this already.  Can't wait to see where the devs take it.*update*  controls - I just purchased a HOTAS setup the other day and this game works beautifully with it.  There is no going back to m+kb after having experienced this game with a HOTAS.  Thats not to say the m+kb contols arent phenomenal, they are, but wow is this game a blast with a joystick and throttle.   This is probably the best EA purchase I've made.  The game is brilliant.** Now playing with dual joysticks.  EXCELLENT.*****Thought I should comment on the dev's.  These guys are awesome.  Consistent and reliable communication.  Meaningful monthly updates!  It is so great to see this in the mass of lost EA titles nowadays.  I have complete confidence in this team and this game.  It is an absolute joy."

It's simply incredile. Smooth controls, lots of input options, well polished UI's for VR, an immersive feel, good enemy AI (much more mature that two other current 6dof shooters I've tried; those being Sublevel Zero and Descent Underground) and a far more ""complete"" feel to the single player experience.I'm hoping this project continues, because I do look forward to playing a long, grueling solo campaign through as many levels as you can toss at me. Titan enemies (bosses) in large arenas could also be a plus to the current level-end ""destroy the core"" type mechanic.So far, excellent. I truly hope this project comes to completion, because the core elements are there, and they work better than any other games in this category.Here's a first impressions video I made using the HTC VIVE:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJeIXHCy5CEI plan on trying it in the Rift sometime soon as well."

Personally, I feel they nailed the physics of the ship. The missiles look and feel great. Flares and lighting are so nice. It's super satisfying to destroy enemy robots in the way they react to the weapons etc. Played it just under an hour in VR(vive) with next to no tech problems. Just click play.. and play.

76561198115693013,Recommended,448850,31200416,Posted: 17 April,all,Grandpa Badass,"This is Descent as it is supposed to be. Overload catches 100% of the original gameplay and atmosphere: Flying through narrow and dark tunnels, caverns and rooms, peering around corners, always looking out for bots which may sneak up at you and suddenly firing at you.A nice selection of weapons and missiles closely resembled to their original Descent counterparts. Same goes for power-ups and game mechanics: flares, the way doors open, flight control, etc; everything is just plain Descent but with more modern and polished graphics.Since this is Early Access, not all content is yet available. The single player campaign is still worked on, you just get one level from it (as of April 18th), however, more content is added constantly. Just check out the timeline of the devs.With multiplayer being implemented (announced after game release) and level editor in the works this game has so much potential. Overload is THE Descent of the 21st Century. :)PS: I am playing on Linux.It's just amazing."

It is a really good fit, but initially it made me want to vomit.  6DOF control and locomotion style control is crazy hard on your brain, but once you realize there is no floor it gets better.  Great, infact.The six degrees of freedom in this game combine with using an HMD make for some really sick gameplay.  Circle strafing and shooting in 3D while scoping out your next target coming in from your top right is spectacular.  The levels are quite complicated to navigate but there is a 3D map and also a guide you can follow, if you want to do that.  When I had the default graphics settings the game ran pretty poorly in VR but once i turned off ambient occlusion it ran much higher, 90fps.If you were a fan of the originals, you'll probably enjoy this. Early access, and says it will be releasing early 2018.  Pretty cool right now, but will be even better later."

This game has come so far in such little time, really looking forward to the finished product. Keep up the good work!Word of warning: Sadly I fell into the trap of purchasing Descent Underground under the impression it was the real deal only to find out I got a bit excited and impulse purchased before doing my research! Yeah my bad XD1 : It plays like a generic 6DOF game, just not Descent2 : Its created by a team that licenced the name and even had the cheek to include original Descent footage in there launch trailer to trick buyers as if they contributed! (This has since been removed but still, it’s a dirty tactic that’s obviously caused them some shade)So my conclusion, this is the spiritual successor to Descent in every sense of the word!If you are an old school fan get a copy now!If you purchased Underground aswell, my commiserations (it could still turn out ok if the devs stop farting around with multiplayer & you ignore the name and just treat it like a generic 6DOF game”"

Overload gets the old Descent feeling way better. That's for several reasons:Overload's gameplay is way more fun. The action takes place mostly in close combat, where navigation is key without the game being too hectic. Your weapons have this Ooomph that just feels right. Also the weapons have a good variety (I love the Creeper mines and the Driller cannon!). Enemy's have good recognizable silhouettes and an already pretty good variety. Although the levels are small in this Early Access version, they are well structured and despite one section in the demo level that's labyrinth-like have a clear layout where it's hard to lose track.The graphics are great. Yeah, they are more simple than in other games, but that's for the better in this kind of genre. When your action is fast paced and your orientation is difficult because of the six degrees of freedom, it is best to keep the visuals simple to not overexert the eyes (as Descent Underground does). It has style and atmosphere and serves the gameplay - and for me that's far more important than fancy shaders and trillions of polygons on screen.My only cons thus far:- I encountered several crashes- there is only one single player level- there are only four challenge levels- there is no multiplayerSo only buy this, if you want to support the devs, not if you want to have a complete game to play. It's far from finished. But I'm pretty damn sure the finished game (announced for fall 2017 as far as I know) will be awesome!"

While many of the weapons look a bit different they have the same feel and you can clearly tell which weapons they were influenced by.  A few things like the pickup sound are even near direct clones of Descent.  The only available level to play at the time of writing this, while short, is exactly the same feeling, twitchiness and exploration combined with combat against robots.  This will remain a very positive review if they finish this off and keep the same feeling."

It's pure and untainted Descent action with a nostalgic yet refreshed facelift. Flight physics feel great great, atmosphere is vastly improved, subtle destruction upon damaged robots is a nice touch, the robots are legit scary looking, and they sound more manacing than ever. The soundtrack by Dan Wentz is great and is exactly what Descent always needed; looking forward to purchasing or downloading the music.Don't tell Interplay, but I'm definitely casually calling this Descent 4."

The art direction  and implementation is phenomenal, it looks exactly how descent would look if it were made today (which it is, it's Overload).  The sound and music are fantastic, the enemies are super fun to duke it out with, the visuals are shiny in exactly the right way, and the movement is spot on.  Game is limited at the moment but if the campaign follows the trend set by the outpost demo level this will be one hell of a revival for 6DoF games."

I play with a 3 axis joystick for turning anda keyboard for sliding, you have the option to map a key for slide toggle whichlets you slide left-right and up-down with the joystick just like the original Descenthad (this feature is sadly missing in Descent: Underground).In short:This game is the spiritual successor of Descent."

Its like I was deaf before. :-)I cannot believe the quality of audio while playing this game, aside from the panic, stress, ""HOLY MOSES Where did THAT come from"" and ""Dammit!"" as I spin in yet another golden  starburst of defeat.The noise of this game is astounding. From the weapons to the crunch of metal impacts to their death-grunts. Horroble creature noises as if something was alive in the shell of the exploding Robot and this wierd really spooky gutteral throat-splutter. Creepy.The craft are gorgeous to look at and their controls are veryr ealistic. Enough drift to feel youre flying and hovering and enough manouvrability to swing in and out of obstacles.The environments are thoughtfully created.  We've all seen digital worlds from laboratories to sunny wastelands but this is a kind of mixture of rocky tunneling as well made by ""something burrowing!!!"" and hi tech arenas.Only one thing I would like included. I enjoy the surprise of these Bots springing out at me and the ""heart leap"" as they appear and blast me to hell BUT..... I would like them to hum, whine, whirr or clatter as they ambled about chasing me. Not just whine deafeningly with a circular saw chiseling off my shields.If you remember Descent of olde, this is just like that only better. All the good points emphasised.If you dont know what Descent was because you're too young.... you're in for a mean surprise.It's already money well spent and it isn't finished yet.I hold my breath because I think an ultimate Challenge is going to be playing online against people across the world.THAT  I await with impatience.Neil Armstrong."

Made by the same loving team that made the original games, their only goal is exactly what any game devloper's of long-lasting games, and any fans of such, should be - to make the old games live again, but better.

,Recommended,448850,34477549,Posted: 25 August,all,Suukorak,"A smooth, streamlined 6DoF shooter with a history long predating its development.From the people who made Descent so many years ago, a modernization of the same mechanics (without the same title, for legal reasons). Even the weapons are mostly the same concept. That's not to say that the game isn't original or inventive; there are plenty of things unique to it as well (time bombs, creepers, the overload powerup). The game simply draws from an older inspiration, and is therefore better thought-out, and has even picked up some of the old community surrounding Descent.The ship is a joy to control, and all the weapons and so on are intuitive and responsive. The game has an easy setting on which you can demolish hundreds of enemies, but it can also get very challenging if you set it that way. The atmosphere can vary from map to map, but it tends to be a little dark and somber. Not a horror game, but dark nonetheless. A lot like its predecessor, Descent.As it currently stands, the game has three story-mode (read: campaign, there is no real story) levels, and an infinite survival sort of ""challenge mode"" with eight or nine maps. The challenge mode can get a little repetitive in my opinion, but it takes a while. Updates have been regular and never fail to introduce something new and interesting. The game also has the ability to give you a good deal of statistical information on your own performance (if that interests you)."

The game feels like a descent game and if you enjoyed that aspect of the original games then you will love his game. I do have a few dislikes however, firstly the robots look too similar and there is no message like in the original descents about how these robots operate. There is also the problem of the spawners spawning way no many enimies for a player on a harder difficulty than rookie to deal with. Of cause you have to remember hat this game IS in development and many of these issues may be felt with. I feel like this game has huge potential and can fit the gap made by the 'descent underground' game that is now beginning to look like a cash grab.

,Recommended,448850,30510338,Posted: 14 March,all,ShadesMaster,"5/5OVERLOAD represents a return to form for REVIVAL Productions, composed of those who created a series of games that served as Overloads' spiritual predecessor - The DESCENT series of games. Overload taps into the best of each Descent title, and the team more than manages to create a new experience (the rights to the Descent name and content are, shall we say - messy) that is fully their own (notwithstanding their publishing deal with EA).Games such as the new DOOM combine conteporary trimmings with oft-overlooked aspects that made games of yesteryear historical gems. Overload does this in spades in honoring Descent, with fast-paced gameplay, winding levels, and a plethora of weapons and enemies that are uniquely distinct and NOT generic. Wyverns are elusive critters, while bladed 'Shredders' charge at you with alarming regularity. Most bots go down easily, though in Challenge mode you'll encounter rarer 'Super' versions of these robots - an RPG convention that fits in well with Overload's action to keep you on your toes. Well, your WINGS - you're flying after all!The levels are beautifully crafted, and even the few environments we've seen thus far feature much in the way of variety, while tying the game together as a whole thematically. I can't wait to see what other locales we'll visit - acid, ice, and even overgrown batthegrounds are all ripe for possibility. In traiditonal single-player sense, you're required to find a reactor, destory and thus 'overload' it and the mine, and escape with your life out of the exit. A tried and true callback to the original Descent games that never gets old since each reactor encounter has different, alternate and increasingly tough challenges and puzzles per map to ensure things remain changed up.If you're a fan of FPS, flight sims, and even RPG's, you'll wanna check out Overload. And you're going to enjoy the ride."

For everyone else, go check out Overload Teaser 2.0. It's free!  And, prepare for war! Hope to see you in the mines, materiel defenders :) The only thing I will miss as far as content when the full version launches is if they do not add a guide bot, and, also, I will miss the voice of the lady that did the pre-insertion mission briefings in the Playstation versions, Descent, and Descent Maximum, if they do not add any voice talent to that effect."
