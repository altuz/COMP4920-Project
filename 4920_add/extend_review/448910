It's also hard to find elegant strategy games that are easy to learn and unfold their depth by the combination of relatively straight-forward rules. Axes and Acres delivers on both fronts!The game resembles an economic solitaire board game, but uses the digital format to take full advantage of randomization (map, cards, goals, dice) to keep every playthrough fresh. All of the randomness happens before the player is making decisions though and can be mitigated in various ways, so it never feels unfair but more like a set of conditions you have to make the best out of every turn.On top of that, the game uses a ranking system to dynamically adjust the difficulty to the player's skill every match. It's a feature far too few single-player games use.All in all this is, so far, probably the most interesting game I've played this year."

If you are successful you move on to the next phase where you keep all the infrastructure you have built, but the actions which give you Victory Points change. After you beat all three phases you win the map and increase one rank.Each rank you go up increases the number of Victory Points required to beat the next map, however if you lose two maps in a row your rank decreases by one. This does a really good job of making sure things never get too hard or too easy for you."

I don't have much experience with puzzle games but in my unqualified opinion (take it with a grain of salt), I'd say it's an instant classic that ranks up there with the likes of Tetris.  It has the added bonus of having brilliant yet simple mechanics that could easily be converted into a tabletop game.  I suppose it's not the prettiest game to look at and might repell people who are hung up on aesthetics, but it has a style of it's own and it's definitely worth trying out.  Some of the rules are a little muddy due to the simplified and sometimes cryptic UI, but you'll pick them up fast enough after going through the tutorial.  Totally compelling and original game, highly recommended!"

You build a little town, making your build choices differently based on variations in the layout of the terrain and the victory point conditions that vary in each play-through. It is consistent enough to appeal to (former) chess player in me, but random enough to be exciting and new each time. Random cards and ""dice"" (types of ""people"" you can use each turn to take various actions) keep it exciting, forcing tactical adjustments every turn, but largely without upsetting your larger strategy.It has its limits. Once you have really mastered it (I am 5th on the leaderboards) it is pretty much done. You cannot play it 20 totally different ways for 10 years like the best Civ-type games of all time. But the subtleties of tactics and strategy are absolutely fantastic to figure out along the way despite what look like incredibly simple mechanics. So it is an wonderful puzzle game wrapped in a tactical game that is wrapped in a builder game. While I am pretty much done with it, it will stay in my memory as one of the best games I have ever played."

76561198006668383,Recommended,448910,25236377,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,Iniyari,"Axes and Acres ReviewThe review below, and others, can be found in my Announcements page(http://www.mercedesmace.com/announcements/game-review-axes-and-acres)This is the second game (Steam, Apr 2016) by a small indie developer, BrainGoodGames.(http://www.braingoodgames.com). They had a great hit with Militia (on Steam Dec 2015),  and just released a new game (Skyboats, Steam Aug 2016). I'm a bit behind the Steam  release schedule; I only got around to picking up A&A this month. In the past two weeks,  I've put 46 hours into A&A, and can strongly recommend it.For the record, I would recommend Militia as well. Although they're both turn-based  strategy (TBS) games, they each have a different vibe. Militia feels like the kind of  game an RTS player would like, whereas A&A feels more like a base-/city-builder. If you  preferred Dawn of War 2 to Dawn of War 1, then Militia's probably your game. But for fans  of Caesar, Pharaoh, Stronghold--games in which dealing with your city's growth and  development is the critical task, and dealing with armed invaders is only a passing  concern--A&A is definitely for you.Building on the square-grid based, minimalistic art style of Militia, Axes and Acres is a  solid turn-based game with randomly generated villages and objectives during each round  of play. When a new round begins, three sets of sub-objectives are rolled, representing  three distinct phases of play. I believe the developers (BGG) refer to these as early,  mid, and late game phases. With the update near the end of August, victory points  required for the completion of each phase have been rebalanced to ensure equal strategic  difficulty during each phase. Complete all three phases, and you move up in difficulty.  Fail twice at a difficulty level, and you drop down to the previous level.Militia felt more like a game of chess or checkers: the board is the same size each time,  and each piece moves and attacks in well-defined ways. A&A expands on this model in  several ways. Each 'Peasant' in your village is represented by a d6. You begin each round  with six peasants; reproducing to grow your population is a critical strategic point. While each Peasant die has the same faces (two Work, two Build, one Gather, one Reproduce which I like to call 'Heal'), the dice are rolled at the beginning of each of your turns, so your strategy in in part dictated by the faces that you roll each turn. Placing a die onto the board requires Food, one of three resources you must manage during each round. Do you spend this turn focusing on food gathering? Building? Gathering other resources? Your strategic decisions are made based on the number of VPs you need, how many turns you have left in each phase, and unexpected opportunities or hindrances provided by which faces your dice roll each turn.Managing your resources in A&A actually feels a lot like Star Ruler 2--there exist a multitude of ways to transform one into another. At the beginning of a round, you start with five 'Motivation' cards. Building the higher-tier buildings in your village can provide you the opportunity to gain more cards. So it turns out that you have two additional resources: 'Moves' and 'Cards'. Six resources total: three literal (food, wood, stone), and three strategic (dice/people, moves, and cards). Like a card-building game, you want to keep your card stack strategically lean, because you must spend all of the cards in your stack before the stack reshuffles. Many cards give you two opportunities to use them, to use dice, and to interact with your board and other resources. But if you need to kill rampaging barbarians, having a glut of build cards won't help you!At those advanced buildings, you have opportunities to train your peasants (and other dice) to become more advanced positions: woodsman (two gather faces, one wild), priest (three crusade faces, one wild), mason (three build faces, one wild, one stone), actor (always rolls wild, can be deployed as work, gather, heal, build, or crusade), and noble (two VP faces). Some phase objectives award you VPs for having two advanced peasants. Or perhaps your strategy requires more build faces than you've been rolling. In the later difficulty levels, the number of VPs required to finish the third phase become so high that you may just want to build a castle and convert your peasants to nobility, and brute force your way to victory.Being used to playing 4X and Grand Strat games, the simplicity of A&A's interface put me off initially, but I warmed to it. I also thought that I'd eventually tire of the gameplay loop--it's a game of raw mechanics, not much story, not much customization, only a handful of buildings. I likened it to Star Ruler 2 earlier; I'd say that the two games have a lot in common: tightly intertwined mechanics, adoption of new strategic elements when the current situation demands it. I have found the mechanics compelling enough to keep me playing all month--my intrinsic motivation has become enthralled with the experience A&A provides!Axes and Acres could just as easily be a solo board/dice game--BGG should probably consider kickstarting a hardcopy version.  :)  The use of the computer medium is less important for A&A than it was for Militia. However, the user interface, while simplistic, is not explicitly designed for mobile/touch devices. It could probably make use of keybindings, but it does give you hover-over information, and uses both left- and right-click commands.I give A&A a solid recommendation to fans of strategy mechanics, minimalistic interfaces, and/or somewhat casual strategy themed games! I'm looking forward to reviewing BGG's newest game!"

It's enjoyable for the same reason minesweeper is enjoyable, it's a lightweight little brain game which doesn't take a ton of time to play, and is pretty variable. Build your tiny society and protect it from marauding barbarians as you try to complete randomly spawned objectives, completing these objectives awards you with VP which must be accumulated in a certain quantity before the turn timer is up. Success moves you to the next phase of the map with new VP conditions, while failure means that it's time to start over from a new map. Simple, enjoyable, and relaxing. My only complaint is that the tutorial could be a bit more animated / well written but you'll get a rough idea of how to play from it."

You manage food, wood, and stone resources to deploy dice, construct buildings and other actions to gain enough Victory Points to win and progress to a harder rank.Careful management of your resources is needed, and using your dice as a resource is part of the fairly steep learning curve. You start with 6 dice and spend them not only for their face value (building, gathering, working, and reproducing more dice), but also one die to ""confirm"" each action, and one die to move 2 spaces. You also use cards to perform actions more efficiently to save on dice.Graphics are clean and well done. Music is relaxing and sound effects sparse in a good way.Recommended for strategy gamers with patience for the learning curve.Long Review------------------------Axes and Acres' menu is very simple. You have some tutorial levels, a teaching video I didn't watch, ""Play"" mode, and an options menu with some basic sound and display options.(The tutorial has been improved in V1.01, but I have not tested it yet.)V1.00's tutorial may be very confusing and frustrating even for seasoned strategy gamers as myself. I had to restart some tutorial levels several times just to pass them, and I still didn't really get the game's basic mechanics when finished.The main mode of the game, ""Play"" mode, starts you out as rank 1 and will progress you 1-2 levels on a win, and decrease your rank on I believe two losses in a row. This flow is actually very nice, and has kept me playing for hours trying to get better at the game and achieve a higher rank. Maps are procedurally generated.Axes and Acres is a strategy game with some very concrete, step-by-step thinking involved. Careful management of your resources is needed to succeed, and using your dice as a resource is part of the fairly steep learning curve. You manage food, wood, and stone resources to deploy dice, construct buildings and other actions to gain enough Victory Points to win and progress to a harder rank.Your objective is to achieve a certain amount of Victory Points (VP) in a certain amount of turns. VP are gained through completing the phase objective on the top of your screen (ex build a road, have 4 houses, hunt an animal, kill a barbarian). Harder ranks require more VP relative to the amount of turns given. Each game has three phases with a VP threshold required to meet phase two and three. When the phase changes, an event happens (positive event on lower difficulties, negative on higher ones) and your three phase objectives change as well.You start with 6 dice and spend them not only for their face value (building, gathering, working, and reproducing more dice), but also one die to ""confirm"" each action, and one die to move 2 spaces. You can't save up extra moves gained this way, though dice left over at the end of your turn do add 1 move to a pool you can use anytime. You also use up to 3 cards a turn to perform actions more efficiently to save on dice. This detailed management may seem tedious to many players, but after playing this fun game a while you will get used to it, and is all part of the strategy and fun of Axes and Acres. :)The player starts out a match with just two houses by a river. They must expand their infrastructure over the course of the game to gain enough VP in time. Axes and Acres features 15 buildings that will let your dice navigate the map, collect resources easier, ""upgrade"" your dice, generate powerful cards to your deck, and more! It takes hours to realize the potential of buildings and their effects.Graphics are nice and simple, with a large and clean interface. Don't confuse simple with lazy — the graphics are very well done and all fit a cohesive art style. The music is doable, there's two or so acoustic-y tracks that play and serve as some good background music, though about half of the time I like to listen to my own. Sound effects are simple but nicely done, nothing over-the-top or annoying and fit in well with the relaxing atmosphere (minus the stressful thinking involved :P) and minimalist style of the game.Overall, I would recommend Axes and Acres for those with the time and patience to learn the game. There is great fun to be had for those that enjoy step-by-step thinking and setting both short and long-term goals for a level."

It takes a while to fully understand it (watch the tutorial video's but certainly Tom Chick's video for more info) because the game lacks a good tutorial or manual and the user interface is a bit too minimalistic, but once you get it, you'll love it!Update: the tutorial has been completely redone. I have not tried it but others say it is much better now. The developer is really active around this and his other games, he talks to his players and listens.The game has a leveling system, when you win, your level rises and the next challenge will be harder. I have seen this in more games before, but I have never seen it work so perfectly as in this game. This game really seems to perfectly know what to do to make it just that bit harder for you the next time you play it. Every playthrough, if I won, it was at the last or before last turn. Although it's a turn based game, I was on the edge of my seat because you think: oh no... I'll never make it.But by carefully planning and thinking out strategies, not clicking before you have completely thought it through, you will make it.It doesn't have AAA graphics, it doesn't even have a good user interface and a good manual, but give it an hour to watch the video's and do a couple of playthoughs, and you'll see that it's all worth it!

Most of the actions you take drive you towards earning victory points, and you must earn a fixed amount of points before a turn limit expires to win.Like most board games, you're going to need to spend a little bit of time just getting to understand the systems. You might spend a couple of matches feeling a bit confused and frustrated, but if you go through the tutorials and stick with it for just a little bit, you'll find a tremendously rewarding little gem of a game waiting for you on the other side.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to cozy up under a blanket and enjoy a few more rounds of this wonderful game."

The idea is based around making the best of each situation, using the given tiles on board, the dices you throw each turn and the individual goals for each level. It will award people who are good in planing ahead and are a little creative. Brain-wise I found it pretty demanding. There is an interactive tutorial and a link to a You-Tube video explaining some concepts to get you started. You will still have to do some trial- and error though, but I did like this exploring side of the game, trying to learn the mechanisms by yourself and how things work together.The further you will get, the more it will count to make the best out of every single move, as the goals become quickly quite demanding.The developer seems to be a nice guy and is interested in feeback, so I'm sure the next update isn't gonna be far.Some negativ issues as well:- I have encounterd once some graphical glitches in the tutorial missions and only there. I was not able to reproduce it. So probably it was some very rare event. I have contacted the developer about it already and he will look into it.- It's strictly English only. That might be a problem to some.- The music won't set you on fire probably.- I can't say if the game will become repetitive after 15-20 hours. Right now it's very exiting and I can't wait to give it another try.Deutsch:Ich habe bisher nur wenig Zeit mit dem Spiel verbracht, allerdings gefällt es mir bisher, so dass ich mich entschlossen habe eine kleine Empfehlung auszusprechen.Das Spiel wird sicherlich insbesondere Freunden abstrakter Brettspiele, Puzzelspiele und Solitärspiele zusagen. Es geht im Prinzip darum, aus dem Würfelglück, in Kombination mit den Begebenheiten auf dem Spielplan und den gesetzten Zielen eine individuelle Strategie zu erarbeiten. Gefördert werden die Fähigkeiten Planung und (ein wenig) Kreativität. Nach so einem Level, dampft einem ganz schön der Kopf. Das interaktives Tutorial bereitet einen in drei Stufen auf das Spiel vor, ein You-Tube Video gibt es auch dazu. Danach kann man loslegen, muss aber am Anfang mit einigem an ""trial and error"" rechnen. Ich selber fand es aber spannend mich mit den Details der Spielmechanik vertraut zu machen und wie alles zusammenspielt.Je länger ich das Spiel spiele, umso mehr offenbart sich mir die Tiefe des Spiels. Es geht ums optimieren jedes Zuges. Über einzelne Levels wird der Spieler in immer anspruchsvollere Ziele herangeführt.Der Entwickler ist sehr engagiert und ich bin mir sicher das nächste Update kommt bald.Negative Aspekte seien auch erwähnt:- Im Moment habe ich vereinzelte Grafik-Bugs festgestellt, bei denen die Wüfel auf dem Spielplan nicht richtig dargestellt werden. Allerdings konnte ich es nicht mehr reproduzieren. Kann also sein, dass es eine Ausnahme war. Der Entwickler ist auf jeden Fall informiert und interessiert.-EDIT: Bisher stellten sich die Grafik-Bugs nur im Tutorial dar. Im Spiel selber keine Bugs bisher festgestellt.- Die Musik ist relativ eintöniges gedudel (zumindest für meinen Geschmack), ich habe schnell die Mute-Taste betätigt.- Alles ist auf Englisch, dies mag für manche ein negativ Punkt sein- Bisher unklar ist, ob das Spiel nach 10-15 Stunden anfangen könnte sehr repetetiv zu werden.

With static images, I would expect better visuels, but in the end - thats not what the game is about. Its part puzzle, part risk/reward management. Rolling dice each turn to determin your options, then resolving those options in the most efficient way possible. You must keep your food flowing, or you will be unable to do much with your dice, but you also have to think about defense, while at the same time upgrading your dice to gain more control over the random elements.Each time you win, you play the same game again, but with fewer turns to reach your goal. The path to victory changes a bit each time, as does a few bonuses. The map also changes, but I find this to be of minor importance, as I love building roads.After a few games it gets a bit boring and repetative, but this only lasts a few hours, as I find myself draw back to this simple, yet well crafted game.There are so many ways that this game could be expanded, with new challenges, more variety between missions and unique challenges.

After that watching a couple of longer how to videos made the rules clear.You aren't playing against an AI, you are challenging the rules of the game. I wasn't sure I would like that but it turns out to be great. No worry about poor computer AI or a cheating AI.

The goals for this game are clear, but sadly it's not as intuitive as I thought it would be, and the scarce and rushed documentation doesn't really help.However, if you're the patient type (or the explorer type), once you've gone past the trial and error stage, you can have a lot of fun with it. The challenge curve as you go through the levels is perfect. It makes you think and plan ahead, and the random elements of the game actually make it more fun instead of more punishing.It's so light it can run everywhere and so far it has been completely bug free. It could stand to be a little cheaper though.Overall, a very good game. If you can pick it up with a small discount, do not even doubt it."

Instead, you are given a tutorial that does not explain anything, only orders you to do certain action (that is NOT the way I want to learn about games), and lengthy tutorial video that of course cannot be consulted when you want to explore a particular feature of the game.This would not be such a problem in case of an established genre like point and click adventures that are simple enough to pick up and play. However, this particular game has very unusual conventions, even grasping what exactly are actions available to players and what are their use and impact on the game. For example, you spend workers to move other workers. How the heck you should ""discover"" this peculiar mechanic without a proper manual?The interface is a haphazard mixture of buttons of various sizes, with vague descriptions like ""Build 3"". Build 3 what? Compare this to games like Renowned Exploreres that create a set of distinctive symbols representing knowledge, renown, supplies, etc, that simplify the understanding of the game quite a lot. Yes, there are tooltips, but they are very inconsistent in the way they provide information.Axes and Acres may be even a very good game, but I will never know. Fearing that I will not have enough time to decide if I like it due to the necessary battle with  the interface and lack of explicit explanation of the game fundamental principles, I have requested a refund."

I read all the help on the icons (basic and advanced), but still doesn't work.I can play normally on regular game, but I need the tutorial to be able to understand what's going on at all!"
