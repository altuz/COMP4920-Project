I bought it because of the 'Hack it!' contest, but its not worth it.The first part I had to restart because I couldn't move. The second part there was talking for a few minutes, then I had to restart AGAIN because I couldn't move. When I finally find a terminal, I can't get out of it in ANY way, without restarting.In current state, do NOT buy. It's broken and missing ALOT of things."
,Not Recommended,448940,23658369,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,Spelmyst,"Currently it's broken.As others have stated, I got stuck in the terminal and had to quit the game to get out.There is no way to replay the radio conversations and read what they're talking about. Which would be useful, because the guy tells you a login and password, but if you're not ready with a screen shot you'll miss it and not be able to see it again.Perhaps I'll revisit this game later, if they decide to patch it with a number of fixes and updates."

,Not Recommended,448940,24151233,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Ashes,"This is the game currently: You walk through a few halls, go to a terminal, type login & password information (see the discussion forums), then alter some text. If that's what you look for in a game, then by all means buy it!The publisher/developer states ""at the moment this is an intervention pilot version. Anti-game or a game-contest with a great challenge"".  In other (English) words, this isnotthe actual game that 'Envoy 2' is supposed to be..  it's not evenremotelylike 'Envoy' which itself is a 2D shmup.  Also, the developer onthatgame was ""NCE Software Games"".  Here it's the same as the publisher.. so will it actually be anything similar to Envoy when this ""intervention pilot version"" is replaced? (IF it's replaced)  Who knows! The fact is, right now it's not an actual game.  Oh, and it's not an Early Access title either..Thanks Valve!  As always we can count on you for protecting us from scams like this!*Note: in-game time was less than 15 mins; idle time was 2+ hrs idling for trading cards"

SCIFI WALKSIMAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Had a good hook and a decent engine but the execution is severely botched with technical issues, bad map design, debatable choice of long foreign dialogue with subtitles. Game had good resolutions support, really liked the ambiant track. Too bad.Not much to say. The game starts abruptly but hooks you in quick. Russian voice over is unintelligible to my ears but I can still appreciate the inflexions and tone and the subtitles were doing decent enough a job. Liked that they did not try to make it pointlessly gritty. Early plot hook is having to evade a facility populated by a cowardly survivalist ex employee and a crazed expert systems in charge of the defense grid. I went through a few corridors populated by lasers. All the corridors led to dead ends. Eventually as I was backtracking trying to figure out whats wrong I clipped through areas of the floor I shouldnt have have been able to trapping me. The game seems to feature no save game option either. The audiovisuals were okay but there was a lot of motion blur. The same metal corridors get old quick and the interactivity was far and few between. Removed for declutter."
