You run your character through different maze-like levels where you can find items and you have to dodge monsters and get to the exit.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did and now they have added 3 more achievements!  Only takes a little while to play, but well worth the 49 cents I paid for it."

Guide Lily through a deranged nightmare cellar that would make the town fire marshall weep inconsolably, all in search of her stray teddy bear.Controls could be a little slow in responding some times, but it's not a platformer, and you're not really supposed to be running around all crazy when you might stumble into a hungry cellar monster. Overally, it was inexpensively entertaining."

,Not Recommended,449060,22134004,"Posted: 29 March, 2016",all,genoforprez,"I bought this game mostly because it looks extremely charming and I was kinda digging the atmosphere in the trailers and screens, but once I started actually playing the game, it quickly became apparent that it was not for me.Strike One:The controls. I am not a fan. This is not a game where you control the character freely, as in many top-down games such as old school zelda and console RPGs. Instead the character moves from square to square on a grid. If you just tap left, the character will move left one entire square. This isn't necessarily a problem in games that have reasonably-sized grid squares, but the grid squares in this game are so incredibly enormous that it only feels awkward.Strike Two:The gameplay is pretty dull. It basically amounts to putting the player in a maze with a locked exit. You have to find the key and escape, but when you pick up the key a thing will chase you, so if you don't reach the exit fast enough you will die and have to start over again. It's not very exciting gameplay, but the thing that really killed it for me is that there are, for example, tiles that you can only cross over once and then they crumble and can't be crossed again, so if you mess up once, you botched the entire level and just have to suicide or restart.Strike Three:I played several levels and it was literally that exact same thing in every room. The scenery didn't change and the gameplay did not get more interesting. I was hoping the game would be a little bit more of an exploration/adventure type of game, but the gameplay is more like an old Atari game, and not really in a good way.I love that pixel art, though!Verdict:7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs."

Don't let it fool you though as there are some tense moments and enough challenge to make you mad and keep coming back until you get it right. Impressive for such a small game.

I bought this for my friend's daughter to play when she came over and I needed to attend to something else for a bit. She's had quite a bit of fun with it, and after watching her play I had to try it! Now I feel the need to go after the achievements.Simple, entertaining, and I like the strange jelly bean monsters. Great way to pass some time."

,Recommended,449060,28775536,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Jakobs413,"This game is amazing. It has a neat story line of a little girl trying to find her teddy bear. Just, keep in mind what lurks in their oddly large cellar. I mean.. Who has a cellar that dense with odd creatures roaming the depths?! No wonder I am missing some clothes from the washer...Oh, sorry, off-track.Anyways! The story is really gripping as it seems (at least for me) to make you want to find the teddy bear. Just, when you find him, be careful of our not so fluffy friend that is trying to stop you. Though, the ending is actually quite scary!I am extremely happy to note that this is a family friendly game, and there is nothing bad about it, besides the rush of adrenaline when the deep music plays and our wanna-be fluffy friend chases you. The ending might spook little ones, but it will not be very bad. It will just make them wonder what is really in their cellar at home...""Teddy.. Where did my Teddy go... Mom? Dad? Oh.. They must have left. I need to find that Teddy before I go to bed.."" *And the adventure of your own child ensues*I will not spoil the suspense of what the girl finds out in the end, but I can assure you... It is creepy."

The style of this game kind of reminds me of The Binding of Isaac.Pros:CheapFunChallenging at timesNice art designCons:Same music all the timeNo clue as to how far in the game you are (no level number or name)This review was written after a little bit of time spent on the game.

76561198066292282,Not Recommended,449060,22015377,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,Great White Drake,"Art design is well thought out, and the music, while repetitive, fits the game quite well.The main problem with the game though is that it's incredibly repetitive. Same music track every level, similar level design, and little to interact with gives a sense that while it is well made and interesting in the first few levels, it starts becoming boring very quickly. It eventually comes down to you getting lost in a rather uninteresting environment, having to look for both key and door before progressing. One mistep and it's back to the beginning with you, having you restart your trek all over again. That and whenever you DO die, it plays the sad trumpet sound, completely breaking whatever immersion the game had been giving you.It's good that it's only a bit over a dollar, but that doesn't mean that there can't be cheap games that are also fun to play. Different level designs, different monsters, and new music tracks (including an actual game over sound that fits a horror style arcade game), would really go a long way with this one. A good horror game to start you 6 year old with, maybe, but being not scary enough to fit the horror theme and not interesting enough to play without it doesn't give this game much replayability.Good for maybe an hour or so, but it still left me somewhat disappointed."

Achievements exist, if you care about that kind of thing.  ;-)Not a whole lot of storyline, but I still found it fun for the short amount of time it took to get the game beat.  Upon beating you unlock a time-based difficulty version of the game."

,Recommended,449060,35354386,Posted: 30 September,all,D3r0z,"My Review about ""Cellar""Honestly, I bought this game for level and achievements, not to play it. I know, these games aren't really good and you may don't like them, but the story who is behind of this game is amazing. Not anybody can come with a great ideea for a game, and not anybody can make it alive.As you probably already know, on Steam you can find a lot of cheap games, but really bad games: without graphics, without gameplay, without ideeas.Yes, this game may be called a ""phone game"", that kind of a game who are downloaded by kids from google play when they don't have something better to do, then they're finishing and uninstalling it, but the ideea is still great. As I said, I think there was some work, so the game deserves some appreciation.The story is awesome, graphics are casual, but awesome for this price, and if you think the game is bad, compare it with other games at this price, you'll see the difference. And yes, the game is short, but you're not finishing it after first 50-100 fails.I would like say thank you for this game. :)"

Obviously it is the utmost importance that the lost teddy is retrieved, so the girl heads down to the basement. Your objective on each level is to pick up a key and then make a run for the door, while avoiding the monsters and hazardous pipes (they should really call a plumber). If you die, you restart from the beginning of the level.The graphics and music are charmingly simple. The gameplay is basically a memory game, pick up the key after you discover a path to the door and remember that route. It is very, very short - I beat it in 14 minutes; but it is the price of a can of Coke. I really can't fault it on that.If you want 15 minutes of entertainment, buy this game."

For the gameplay it's simple to tell, you walk through labyrinths and try to collect all the toys. If you collect the key, the monster will appear and chasing you. If it catches you, you die instantly. Some of the achievemnts can make you get stucked, like the ""diggy diggy hole"" one. There are also a few bugs, where the monster glitches outside the map. The hitboxes sometimes detect death situations, where there wasn't one. Mabye it's because of the huge blocks the game uses. I guess it also affects the controls a bit, because sometimes the game reacts too late on your input. What I really liked was the artstyle and the atmosphere. I also like that some achievements really challenge you and are not that simple to get. :) (\ô/)"
