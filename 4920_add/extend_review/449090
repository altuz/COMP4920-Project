,Not Recommended,449090,22412361,"Posted: 14 April, 2016",all,Sieg,"Worst car park everI expected very little, I got very little. Admittedly I'm a big fan of the zombie genre, so at the asking price I figured why not give it a go? Even at the low asking price, I can't recommend Zombie Parking. The main reason is evident after 10 minutes of gameplay; repetitive and dull. The novelty quickly wears off as you realise you've done 20 laps around the same parking lot and shot the same generic zombie model a hundred times already. There is little variety in the zombie models, and most times you'll see several of the same model on screen at once.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665317063I guess blue vest and black shorts is in high demand in this neighbourhood.. Also, it is incredibly difficult to die, heck you're almost surprised when you get hit. The zombies inevitably form a small horde, a couple will break off from the pack because they're a little faster, and when you gun one down another will crawl out from a vent somewhere in the parking lot. The only scenario I can imagine a player genuinely getting killed is if they were to somehow get trapped in a corner or by a car by a group of zombies, but this never looked likely whilst I played. In my first session, I got 500,000 points (which is good, right...? Who knows), and unlocked 25/35 achievements before finally succumbing to boredom and switching it off. There was no skill involved whatsoever, just sheer persistence in resisting the urge to exit the game.I would argue the game actually gets worse the longer you play. The zombies don't get faster, more dangerous or more intelligent, but they do turn into bullet sponges. This made a dull game incredibly tedious as you would often run out of ammo, then have to do a lap around the parking lot before being able to collect ammo (which would drop in the same spot every 45 seconds or so). Later in the game, after collecting ammo, it was pointless firing into the horde because each pickup contains one clip, meaning you would take out just 2 or 3 zombies before having to wait for more ammo. I found it was better to pick up a few clips before taking more zombies out, increasing the chain combo and increasing the chance that they would drop ammo too. This is pretty much the only tactical decision I felt I made the entire time playing the game. I should also note that whilst the game runs fine, and there doesn't seem to be any real bugs, I felt like I was using a paint gun when bullets hit a zombie. This was way more noticable later in the game when they turn into bullet sponges.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665311797At the price, Zombie Parking could prove to be a decent purchase (if not overwhleming) if a few changes were made to make it less generic. For example, the zombies: they're either shamblers or shamblers with a little spring in ther step. Players don't really have anything to fear, or anything to be tactical about. Try mixing it up a bit!Fat zombies: slow, bullet sponges, block the players off and does more damageChainsaw zombie: fast, can kill the player in just a few hitsCrawler: fast, low health, can crawl on walls and ceilingYeah they're generic zombie types and we've seen them in countless games, but they would mix things up a bit and make things more challenging. There could also be some variety with the guns, shotgun short range, rifle medium range, far from inspiring. Plus the shotgun is about as useful as a water pistol later in the game. Also, I personally think health and armour should be a bit less available to players, they respawn every 45 seconds or so and as I said, it's surprising when you even get hit.Overall, even at the price, even for zombie fanatics, I just cannot recommend Zombie Parking as it is. It just simply doesn't offer enough. Plus Steam has new sales running every few days, and even at the low cost, you will be able to find something for the same price worth losing hours in."

It's literally just a 3rd person survival horde game with nothing unique. I understand it's an Indie game probably made by 1 person but if you're going to make a game and charge people money (even though it wasn't much) at least put something unique into the game. But at the same time it was pretty fun for the first 10 mins, trying to get a really high score, which was quite easy to do aswell."

For just under a buck....you run around a parking garage....and you gun down zombies until you get bored. You have two weapons to choose from....a shotgun and an AK....and you never have to worry about running out of ammunition since it's so plentiful. There are only two character models for the zombies....male and female....and that....coupled with the near empty parking garage itself....makes for a dull experience. There are a handful of powerups to help you out and numerous achievements to get....but there's nothing that will make you want to invest any real time into the game. The only positive remark that I can give the game....is that aside from the occasional slow down....I didn't experience any kind of bugs or crashes.
,Recommended,449090,22423399,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Redbeard,"Zombie Parking is small zombie killing game. Worth playing for a bit of shooting fun.You are in a car park with a whole lot of zombies, who are constantly coming out of the vents and from under the walls.At your spawn area is a row of four items - armour, health, shotgun shells, and rifle bullets - which keep on respawning (although, after you have collected them, you have to wait a while for them to respawn).The entire game is played in a one-level car park, so there's not a lot of scenery to explore.The defence weaponry consists of a shotgun and a rifle. You start with some limited ammunition, but you can get more from the spawn area and zombie drops.Killing zombies will cause a number of them to drop ammunition, armour, and health - as well as some rarer drops, such as double damage and infinity ammunition (the latter is poorly named, as it doesn't last forever).When you do a few headshots, a red bar appears, and - while it is up - this is your chance to score a lot of points with zombie kills.I thought that the hardest achievement for Zombie Parking would be to get 1,000,000 kills in one game - but it turned out that getting the armour and health achievements took longer, as - if you are playing the game properly - you hardly ever get hit by the zombies at all; not if you are careful, anyway; so, to get those two particular achievements, you basically have to allow yourself to be hit so that you can fill up again on armour and health.At one point, when going for the 1,000,000 kill achievement, I was fighting zombies near a wall and somehow the game glitched, and I found myself outside of the car park building and was unable to get back in again - I was not happy. But it only happened once (mind you, I tried to keep away from the walls after that).It took 3 hours and 10 minutes to get 100% of the achievements for this game - but you should be able to do it a lot quicker if 1) you don't walk through a wall by accident, and 2) you allow yourself to be hit a lot, so that you can keep filling up on armour and health.Zombie Parking is fun little zombie killing game. It's a cheap buy, so you can expect to get what you pay for; but it's fine for what it is. Play it for a short while and then shelve it - you should get your money's worth out of it.I only have three small criticisms of the game:1) The setup implies that you can change the key bindings, but - as far as I could see - the bindings can't be changed (it would be preferable if they could be altered by players to suit themselves).2) It would have been better if it had a melee weapon, in addition to the two firearms.3) You can't save your game. It is quite easy to get massive scores in this game, but it's limited by how much time you want to spend playing it at any one time - so, it would be good if you could save your game and then continue it another day (as the game doesn't have levels, game saves are not highly needed, but it would be useful.On balance, I would recommend this game.Sure, it's based upon a small map (the car park) and it's repetitive (you just run around a lot and shoot), but for $1 you shouldn't be expecting a massive and amazing game.The graphics, ambience, and gameplay look fine.Play it for a bit of shooting fun - that's what it's all about."
,Recommended,449090,30214320,Posted: 26 February,all,Jeath (Spoon Ninja),This is a simple yet fun Zombie game. Great for killing a few hours or just getting a bit of frustration out. As the name suggests its set in an underground carpark and its the only stage. You have a shotgun and an assault rifle and just kill zombies till they kill you. It's nothng new but a nice Zombie grinder the achievents arn't out of reach and you can get alot of them quickly with just a few taking some effort. Ammo and health drops appear as well as some power ups so you can play as long as your skill/patience will allow. If you like to slaughter Zombie's for no good reason then this is the game for you.

You have two weapons available; an AK47 and a shotgun. You can pick up multiple power ups and some which replenish your health, for example.I guess the dev's point was to try their abilities with the UE4 engine instead of making an actual game. For that purpose and the price point, it is okay."
,Recommended,449090,22420005,"Posted: 14 April, 2016",all,BamaKaPow,"I picked up the game while it was on sale so I got it for less than $1. Honestly, I didn't expect much. But, I actually enjoyed playing it. Probably more than I should have. It's so simple to play it's ridiculous. You are in a parking garage with zombies and you shoot them with either your shotgun or automatic rifle. When they die, the zombies drop loot like health replenishers, shields and other items, some I don't even know what they are for. One actually dropped a white skull that killed all zombies when I picked it up. If it had cost more than $1 I'd have trouble recommending it but at only $1 I think it's worth it.Pros:It's a simple, easy to play game that doesn't take a lot of thought to play. It plays well using the Unreal engine. The longer you play, the more difficult it gets. You can shoot gas cans and blow a lot of zombies up at one time.Cons:Since you're only killing zombies and running around a parking garage it can boring petty quickly. There are no additional levels or difficulty settings. The zombie models and movements are limited and redundant.Recommendation:For only $1, or less, I'd say grab it, fire it up and let your frustrations out by the mindless killing of a few hundred zombies.Here's a video of my gameplay if you're interested:https://youtu.be/QronjlG8hag"

There's only one map, two weapons, and assortment of powerups and his and her zombies (only two modles.)  The game is so simple, that the hardest acheivements were the two for recharging your shield and health.  Some of the glitches in this game are almost features - such as the fact that occasionally the unlimited ammo powerup just stays on.  And glitch is almost meta:  If you play long enough without dying, the zombies dwindle away to nothing, leaving you nothing to do but quit...almost as if it's saying that if the hero in these games were to ever rid the world of zombies, there's nothing left to live for.So why do I still recommend it?  Because for 89 cents, I got 3 hours of play time and some pity laughs, and that was totally worth it."
