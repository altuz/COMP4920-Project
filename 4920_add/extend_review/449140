Very simple premise, easy to get into.  Yet difficult to master.It exemplifies the concept of simplicity.  The developers are definitely onto something great here.Would be nice to have a focused set of gameplay types, but I've been rocking out playing the campaign and pvp battles."
76561198226729772,Recommended,449140,29690911,Posted: 4 February,all,Breakh,"Its a decent game. The campaign is also the tutorial. I spent almost a year playing it.Pro1_Get to build your own ship.2_Ai System for the ships.3_There's multiple player mode. 3v3/ 2v2/ 1v1.4_Moderator are usually on5_Regular  updates.6_Balance weapons.7_Its Free.Con1_Theres essentially one game mode.Which is one team vs another team in captureing points/flags.2_Matching making isnt balanced. It gets decided by the host.For example if the host has a full 3 pros  on their team, the host can let 3 new players in the opposite team.Basically a slaughter fest.3_Match Making is also very messy due to the multiple lobby that is generate but often stays on even when there isnt players in them.4_The last one is managble but when the theres too many ship in play during a 3v3 crashes often.Heres some way they can fix the game.1_Make sure each player finishes campaign before they can play multiplayer mode.2_Revamp the match making system to 10 lobby max. So people always run into another player.3_Add in another game mode.4_Limit the amount of ship that can be build for 3v3 so you guys can managed the server stress level.I rate this game 7/10 at the momment. I know the dev can do better but i know its also just a  project currently."
76561197971872842,Recommended,449140,30053361,Posted: 20 February,all,Riph,"I'd describe Istrolid an an RTS puzzle game.  Why puzzle game?  Because the campaign is a long series of themed brawls, where the AI comes at you with very specific, themed fleets.  What do you do against the fleet that's all fighters?  Bring flak.  How do you beat the slowpoke turtle guy?  Outrange him with artillery.  Things get *way* more complicated from there.  You have infinite retries and can spend as much time rejiggering your fleet as you like.  I spend more time configuring ships than I do fighting them.This is some of the best free entertainment I've ever had.  Try it!"

,Not Recommended,449140,29403179,Posted: 21 January,all,habibi,"Ok. Let me speak from experience here. The game isn't going to go anywhere with toxic, braindead mods who think stalking is ok as long as they don't see the stalker doing the stalking. The game itself is good, but sooner or later you HAVE to be involved with the community one point or another and that's what truely makes or breaks such a game.Pros-cool spaceships-make ships however you want them-cool communityCons-absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥mods-20x20 grid restriction (although it's a minor inconvenience)"

,Not Recommended,449140,29799661,Posted: 9 February,all,Phoenix Zix,"I don't recommend this game.For several reasons.1.This is a potential game. But it is an online game.You need to register and log in just for the singleplayer.This might not be an apparante fault,but consider once the server's closed, you can't play forever, and we'd have no way knowing when they will close it.And once that's happened your ships are lost forever.I can't play knowing my playability is in other's hand.I used to host a private Minecraft Bukket server and i had to stop it. Those who played on it were very sad. I don't want it to all happen again.2.The game lacks long-term playability. When you've beaten all the ships you actually wins this game. I mean , for example ,look up Reassembly.It's the same genere but it is an open-world where you can get all kinds of encounters and play for domination. YOU ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. But Istrolid simply lets you win/lose a game without much of the bigger picture.3.This game's players seems to utilize specially-crafted ships for purpose of defeating others.While i admire their creativity, I might also suggest that this approach forces others to develop counter approach vehicles that's equally massive. In the end itis a game of LET'S BUILD THE TITAN AND BE DONE WITH IT. This game's design deprives the players of the freedom to play their style4.Graphics.The battles are dull without much excitement(graphically). Like Starsector, when you have a Paragon(Tri-Tachyon BB)and fire everything at another BB IT LOOKS GORGEOUSE. Watch some vids and get an impression and you will see how these two games compare. Also see Reassemby. When you fight fights in Reassembly you get an impression of really in space----engines smoking,plasma flying,missiles shooting everywhere--which istrolid lacks in all respective.5.Plausiability.Why the HELL would anyone want to put two ships and destroy eachother? And how are they manufactued? IS there a way resource is collected? And do people really die in these battles? These are all questions that requires answering. in other words the game lacks in background.Other games lets you fill in the blanks(ie,Reassembly)but i feel hard-pressed to fill in the blanks when i have so cartoonic starships flying around.6.Physics. How are those ships turned without an RCS and what does those damn wings do and why are there no repulse when i fire those damn cannons?why does my bullet lacks stopping power? amd why am i slowing down in mid space?(Okay i have to admit that except point 1 i could have got along with all those problems.)So in all my advice is look around and see if there's other games in this genere you like and compare before you start serious playing. BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THE BEST GAME OF this GENERE IMHO.Unless the devs give us the server files.InThatCase i will certainly reconsider my review.EDIT:Oh FOGOT ABOUT THE DAMN PAID DLC.DAMN EXPENSIVE AND WHAT, JUST FOR ROTATING BLOCKS?MIGHT AS WELL BUY REASSEMBLY."

76561197968008140,Recommended,449140,23947040,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,CryptoKnight,"Amazing game. Bought the ""DLC"" just to support the developers."
,Recommended,449140,29590615,Posted: 30 January,all,h3.,"This game shouldn't be free. I had great fun playing this and subsequently bought the dlc regardless of what it was. A shame you can't build bigger ships and just have capital ship battles with a couple of fighters. If you like ship constructing games where you can change everything you will enjoy this. I personally had a great time pretty much designing entire new fleets for every level once the first easier half of the campaign was cleared. Good progression though, starts out easy enough then gets complex fast. Enjoyable, would pay money for this any day."

76561198041743521,Recommended,449140,29447748,Posted: 23 January,all,Bart,"Tired of a nonsense units in RTS games? You always had better idea what a great ship should be like? Design your own (!!!) nonsense ships (so now you have nobody else to blame beside yourself!) from hundreds available parts and throw them to battle! Great idea nicely made. This game is simple but wonderful with a huge multiplayer potential. While designing your ships you will have to take into consideration many factors so design a ""perfect"" ship is simply not possible. Factors to take into consideration:- total mass of the ship- maneuverability (how fast ship turns)- speed (type of engine)- energy generated and stored- type of mount and type of turret- armor (type, weigh)- additional support or extending systemsYou can design own fighters, med size ships, huge powerfully armored heavy cruisers (with many 360 degrees mounts, many weapon systems and more energy creating potential than Fukushima!), special class of ships such as mobile artillery (or anti cruiser artillery - basically just mount with a powerful artillery cannon, basic engine, basic armor, basic energy generator etc.). It's all up to YOU - you're the designer."
,Recommended,449140,29419620,Posted: 22 January,all,Yaddah,"This game is awesome! If you love games where you can customize your units, guns, vehicles and/or characters to fit your personal superior strategy, then Istrolid is the game for you! In this RTS you can create almost anything and test it vs AI or other players. You can even create your fully AI controlled fleets with 10 custom ships that each fulfill a specific role!Because of this huge diversity, it can be hard to get the hang of this game and figure out what combinations are good and what's bad. Istrolid still needs more elements to ease new players into this complex game. But if you have a curious and creative mind and enjoy spending time to discover optimal ship builds, then the campaign should suffice as a tutorial.Great game! No reason not to give it a try!"
