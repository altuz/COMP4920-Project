,Recommended,449210,33120696,Posted: 2 July,all,CaioKen,"Not the most complex or balanced fighting game out there, but has a ton of charm in it. The characters are well-known stereotypes from police and detective movies, and the causes of each fight are so dumb that made me laugh sometimes.However, Verdict Guilty is HELLA FUN!! The story mode have some objectives to make it more interesting, but still is fairly easy, so even a beginner can finish it without frustration, but not without a little challenge. Each character has a gimmick on their throws and a ""gun"", which adds some depth to the combat, but most of the gameplay remembers Street Fighter 2; so spacing is key to victory.A cheap/fun fighting game and a good choice for a few hours of entertainment."

I laughed like crazy when the cpu was basically utilizing the same cheap stuff that I was doing so being broken had to be intentional on their part. Weird glitches in training where pressing start won't bring up the movelist, but will send you back to character selection. Doesn't really matter. This game is definitely worth picking up even if you might not play it for long."

Fixed bugs and controls were improved! Thank you very much!The atmosphere and the soundtrack are really amazing too. 11/10 guys, you did another good game."

Minor complaint - you cannot rebind your controller.Otherwise, you're in for a crazy story mode with cut scenes, training, survival, and of course, arcade and vs. 8 characters split between cops and crooks, as well as ""clones"" who appear as separate NPCs in story mode. Good backgrounds and funky music.Well worth the asking price!"

I've played many 2D fighting games and I think if you are interested in buying this game you have the previous experiences about 2D fighting games. So, lets cut to the chase. What's the difference between this game and others?Well, you will feel the impact of every kick, punch and bullets. Which is very rare among this kind of retro like genre.Like other 2D fighters, Characters are interesting, story mode is good, music is cool and I think it has its particular 16 bit charm to its graphics.So, if you are broke like me, but still want to enjoy games like Takken or street fighter, buy it."
76561198009316076,Recommended,449210,32301436,Posted: 9 June,all,The Matlock,"For the price of $3.29, Verdict Guilty is an awesome 2D fighter that is worth the time of anyone who enjoys this sort of game. As the screenshots and trailer show, it has a very old school 16-bit style that is just enjoyable to look at, while the music is impressive as well and stands out pretty good on its own.The actual game itself is rather simple. The roster of playable character is only eight, consisting of a subway cop, traffic cop, detective, government agent, terrorist, yakuza, convict, and bank robber. The moves are relatively simple, with simple quarter circle forward or backwards, and towards towards motions, and combos that are simply 3 buttons long. No special meters, no super attacks, etc. It sounds boring but there is actually a semi-deep level of skill involved when it comes to mastering the characters.Now because it was most likely not designed for a large audience, and the lack of online play, not all of the characters are equal. For instance, the subway cop Siu has a combo that simply mashing 'B' over and over and it's ridiculously powerful, to the point I got to round 4 of survival using only that move. Then you have Minso the traffic cop, whose tazer special is super powerful and can be chained three times very easily resulting in near decimation of your opponents health. Not to mention Jae, the Yakuza, whose gun can be fired and reloaded by simply holding and releasing ""X"" and hits multiple times. The other characters fall somewhere in the middle, with the detective being the worst in my opinion.One thing I find that makes the game stand out is the Story Mode. It's unique for each character, going from ridiculous (Minso is trying to find her dog) to heartbreaking (Jae confronts his Yakuza brother about the fate of their father). Most of them result in a battle against Sang, a corrupt politician who is the de facto bad guy of the game, with the occasional battle with a corrupt cop Sabu (sadly neither are playable). A couple of the Story Mode battles end differently however.The Story Mode actually acts like a mini tutorial, as the first battle only allows you use of basic attacks, and subsequent battles only letting you do damage with one attack or combo. There are also some varied ideas, such as surviving against an invincible opponent for a period of time, winning before the time runs out, winning with reduced health, and getting a Wasted/Detained victory (basically get a KO within a few seconds of a throw in the last round)It also handles the idea of mirror matches in an intriguing manner. In Versus Mode or Arcade mode if you end up having to fight your own character, rather then it just be a pallette swap you actually fight a different character with the same moves. For instance, Si'u faces his father Dai-su, Jae faces his brother Sapporo, and Minso faces her fellow detective Mia. What's even more interesting is that in the Story Mode these are actual separate characters who play a role in the story. I thought this was a nice touch.Achievements are relatively simple, simply asking you to clear each Story Mode, win Arcade Mode once, get to 4 wins in Survival, and get a 10 second victory and a 7 hit combo in Arcade Mode. You do have Local Versus in here as well if you wanna hook this up to your TV and play a friend. Beating Arcade Mode unlocks 'Duel' mode where you fight everyone in the game in a single-hit KO tournment, Turbo Mode (self explanatory) and ""Master"" mode (which I haven't the balls to attempt).I got seven hours out of my purchase so I got essentially double what I paid, so I'm satisfied. If you like the sounds of it then go join the fight."
,Recommended,449210,33633712,Posted: 18 July,all,Chemical Taint,"Best game purchase I have made in a long time. I have had no interest in recent fighting games but seeing the 90's arcade style of art and game play, that was dripping out of Verdict Guilty, I had to try it out. The handcuff feature makes the game so incredibly fun and it adds an interesting dynamic to the game, beyond the standard kicks and punches. I also appreciate that the special moves are also pretty easy to learn and I don't need a graphing calculator to plot out some combos. Some people might shy away from the lack of online multiplayer but there is local multiplayer, and leaderboards if you're into that kind of thing. I will note that the game is kind of easy (certainly not a complaint) and I was able to tear through most of the story modes and arcade modes in a couple of hours. My only complain is that some of the pixel art is kind of inconsistant and a few of the characters look extremely cross-eyed."

Lots of stages where you have to beat the opponent using a limited move set so there is some puzzle elements to the smackdown taking place on the screen.Real fight game enthusiasts will not get much from this but for the low price it's not that bad to check out. Couch game potential on the other hand is very good. Simplicity and art style that is the devs trademark supports that.

Yes, the game is unbalanced and repetitive, but it's also simple, cheap and short enough to pick it up and have some fun after your daily routine.The story mode is incredibly wacky (for real, there'saliensalongsidea police corruption crisisin a futuristic South Korea) and while the characters and events have almost no development (everything is basically an excuse for getting into a fight), each one has a different and clear motivation for doing what they are doing. The ending of every one of them are cute with the proper amount of poetic justice you would expect. Gameplay-wise is some kind of challenge mode where you can only win each match doing specific things: hitting the enemy with X attack, surviving until time runs out, etc.If you're a fan of retro games, buy it! It costs like $0.74 when it goes on sale, if three bucks isn't cheap enough for you."

There are 8 characters (Including the token women from the 90's) who are divided between the police force and the villians. also there is a final bossThe game recreates well the feeling of those unpolished fighting games from he 90's, it has orthopedic movement and the hitboxes/hitstuns are at times weird, but there are some mechanics that could be interesting for some- All the characters had a movement that spend bullets.- Characters can only do 1 throw per round, that being said, the throws are special moves: The police characters can handcuff you for 3 seconds, in this state you can't block or do moves but you cant move. The villians set a bomb on your body that will explode after 15 seconds.I can't see myself playing this that much since it doesn't had online mode, but for $2.24 I think that is an ok game that could get you some laughs while playing on versus. Also even though the artwork isn't my taste at all, I liked the police setting and the use of pixel art that recreates well those games from the 90's (even though not like the masterpieces from SNK or Capcom)"

I've bought the previous game from this dev, Super Trench Attack, and the artstyle is similar. The characters are vibrant and unique, there are some very intesting mechanics especially with the bullet/fireball mechanic. It is a WIP but the developer so far has shown he is willing to accept feedback and has already taken alot of good advice under consideration.

It does not offer anything in terms of a learning curve so if you expect some kind of skill progression you won't find it here. I kinda see it as a funny cartoon rather than a fighting game.If you playing story mode you will have to do objectives like only using a specific move. That may be kinda annoying but you can play arcade instead which is just regular fighting. The concept of the game is pretty funny and I enjoyed playing though cheesy story arks.It is pretty obvious that this game is just making fun of Street Fighter 2. It plays like it is 20 years old but I would pay $5 for the laughs and nostalgia it gave me.One of my first games for SEGA genesis was Fighting Masters which was a fighting game with literally 1 button combat (sounds awful right but I liked it). Sure Verdict Guilty is a bad fighting game by today's standards but it is intentionally made that way to give you that feeling of playing the obscure fighting game.Practice mode is not very good because it is the same as playing a regular match. The funny part is that it takes about 15 seconds for you to learn a character anyway. So if you looking for games like SkullGirls that are serious 2D fighting games this is not it.For the most part, combat comes down to spamming. Each character has 1 combo and 2-3 moves which is what you would usually see in most fighting games back then. Still, they all have a small story which is amusing to play through.Music and pixel art are pretty good so for $1-3 you can't really complain. I really like stage backgrounds because they are done in Street Fighter style with a lot of detail.Verdict: 7/10This is an intentionally bad fighting game that is making fun of retro fighting games. You can't compare it to modern games because it is not trying to be that. Perhaps the idea of this game is just to make you laugh so do not take it too seriously. Personally, I think the concept of this game and story arks of the characters are hilarious."
,Not Recommended,449210,23839116,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,RUNNING ★ WILD,"This game feels alot like 16-bit console fighting games than an actual arcade fighting game like Street Fighter II, it reminds me alot of Eternal Champions. From what I played, it just feels very jerky and limited, not any real depth here. I tried out the Training Mode and it's not even a real training mode. The in-game menu's are really bad too, I could not figure out how to configure my controller, so I ended up having to play with punches on the bottom and kicks on top. The controls are not very responsive, often I have to mash just to get a special move to come out and far as I could tell combo's are extremely limited beyond linking a jump normal into a standing normal, and maybe a special move if you are lucky. Very basic and primitive stuff.Overall, not much of a fighting game, but I wasn't expecting much for $3 either. It has a neat art style, but the gameplay is just not there. The arcade mode CPU AI is super easy to beat, until you get to the final boss who just gimmicks you with his seemingly random invincibility frames and his arrests. He even seems to be able to land arrests on you while you jump. Also his bullets are ridicuolous, they do so much chip damage. I had to pretty much abuse the dog call with Minso to beat him, because going in was way too risky, especially with that flamethrower of his. Don't even bother trying to risk arresting and detaining him, it ain't happening!"

The name ""Verdict Guilty - 유죄 평결"" alone was enough to pique my curiosity.I purchase the game, dive into the options, and go into training mode to test out characters, and get a feel for the game's mechanics.I used a PS4 controller, and switched to keyboard controls on occasion. A simple 4 button fighter with a block and grab mechanics. The grab is what really stands out. As you can handcuff your opponent, or ""dizzy"" for maximum damage potential. There are projectiles too: guns, grenades, vials, and animals. The only downside to thew mechanics are moves requiring you to ""hold"" a button/key in order for your fighter to a execute a move. I feel it is a second too long and stresses the button i'm pressing on.The Story mode stages have ""objectives"" akin to Soul Edge (if I recall correctly) where you have to follow certain conditions to progress in a fighter's story arc. You are also taught combo strings and special attacks along the way. 8+ stages to clear per fighter.Arcade, Survival, and Training mode are as expected of fighting games. While the three hidden modes unlocked after beating arcade mode for the first time freshen up the gameplay experience.The fighters themselves are very fun and have their own combo strings and special moves to make them unique. At the moment, there is no way to play as the pallet swap versions of the fighters you encounter in story mode. A nitpick to the roaster is the lack of female fighters. If additional fighters are ever explored, I can envision a female forensic scientist, and female pimp (1 officer, 1 criminal respectively [feel free to use these ideas if you are reading Dev ;j]).There is no online mode, however, your scores for each mode can be seen by others via the options menu (Stylized in a very arcade fashion).Achievements for the game are very reasonable, easy, and fun to go for. I had the hardest time with the 7-hit combo achievement, with a peek at the forums, I was able to achieve it with ease.I love the game so much, I bought the steam trading cards to craft the game's badge, tweeted this game out to Cheap A s s Gamer, and potentially gifting keys to my friends and favorite Let's Players. This is an excellent single player experience that is severely underrated in its multiplayer."

Only, imagine if SNK was a Korean company instead of Japanese. And well, the problem with analogies is they're always inadequate as descriptors.Verdict Guilty is awesome because it takes place in a futuristic cyberpunk version of Seoul. You have a broad selection of colourful characters: an upstanding cop, his alcoholic counterpart, a terrorist cult-follower, a corrupt politician, so on so forth.This game has some real game mechanic innovations, though. Each character can subdue his opponent with either handcuffs or a timed bomb. And each one get access to a projectile that he must re-load.To me, this is my #1 game of 2016 because it would have been my #1 game of 1992. You see, I waited two years for a decent port of Street Fighter II, and what was eventually released was a mess. The screenshots looked nice, but one you loaded it onto your machine, the controls and framerate ruined everything. Boy, developer Hi Tech Expressions reallys screwed the pooch on the PC port -- I was not a happy boy.So you see, my 11-year-old self would have loved Verdict Guilty.

The pixel art is honestly pretty good and something to appreciate as someone who's trying to improve in the medium, it's a good benchmark that isn't top-of-the-line gorgeous but gets the job done and shows love and effort put in. Character designs are a bit silly but overall fitting of the concept, background art fills the scene nicely and has some movement to it so the game feels active and not just slapdashed together. I love that there's a dedicated handcuff button; sure it's just a grab move with a short effect afterwards but it's great to suddenly handcuff your enemy in the middle of a match and just wail them down.Hardcore fighting game fans will probably find it laughable and people who don't care for fighting games will, well, not care, but if you appreciate the genre and aren't too concerned with balance or competitive play it might be a fun romp with a friend who's also not super amazing at 'em.

Nothing has materially changed in the fighting component, which was my big gripe originally.With the update the AI is slightly less stupid, but you can win the entire game by spamming a single F+F+A attack.  Perhaps as a two player game this could be fun, but certainly this is not a viable single player experience.  If you don't care that much about the actual fighting portion, you might be ok.If you have any kind of competency with real fighting games, give this one a pass.Original reviewThis game gets everything right... except the game play.The controls are sloppy and unpredictable, and the AI is a moron that literally plays like a 4 year old that only rushes directly at you while mashing buttons.The only reason I'm not requesting my $0.65 back on the Steam Refund is because I love Retro Army games like STA and Death's Hangover and I want to support them.  I wasn't even going to buy this because I didn't think the game was going to be all that great anyways but I spotted it on -90% so I bought it.  I consider it a gamble I lost.I'm sorry but this game outside of the amazing aesthetics and presentation is a lump of steaming dog mess and I refuse to play it period.  I'll idle for cards but the gameplay is relentlessly horrendous and nothing will make me subject myself to this.  Take away the graphics and it plays like a student-made beat-em-up."

Unfortunately there is only a single player mode with no difficulty settings so I beat it in about 20 minutes without knowing my character's moves. The controls feel a little clunky and the get up animations are a bit deceptive."

,Not Recommended,449210,34400042,Posted: 21 August,all,Peksi Sarvinen,"This cops & robbers themed 2D fighter is shallow as a pool and about as wide as one as well. The fighting mechanics are stunningly simplistic, to a point where brawlers from the 90's, such as the Streets of Rage series, offer a far more enjoyable experience. Hell, the game offers achievements for precisely two fighting related things: getting a four hit combo and winning a fight in 10 seconds. That should be an ample summary of what the combat is like. The only interesting thing on display here was the handcuff mechanic for the coppers, and the sticky bomb mechanic for the robbers (or at least the one robber I played). What that, or the ""Wasted"" mechanic did however, I haven't the foggiest. Probably has to do with the story mode, but the gameplay isn't interesting enough for me to spend any more time with the game, so I suppose I'll never find out. Ultimately, it wouldn't make the combat any less shallow, so it doesn't matter.It's not that it's a bad game. It's well made and has that nice retro aesthetic. It's just that I've seen mobile games with more depth, and in a fighting game the gameplay needs to come first, and everything else third. I played through the arcade mode once and that was enough for me. Half of that would've sufficed, but I powered through in hopes of seeing something more, but I found nothing that would ever have me come back to this again. Doesn't matter if it costs 3€. You can get better stuff for that money, and if you're looking for a cops & robbers game with fighting, I think I'll stick with recommending Streets of Rage 1, which sounds, looks and plays better."

However, this game is a nightmare for non-keyboard players. While it does support X-Input you can't remap the buttons. The controls on my fightstick are by default messed up, making the game difficult to play. Also, the training mode is very misleading, most training modes allow you to practice your moves on a training dummy who's AI by default doesn't move, in most games you can change the AI settings but in this game you just fight the same AI over and over again. Super disappointed."

It dose nothing to hide that it's a SF2 clone, that's the whole point.While the balance is questionable at best, there's a strange hint of originality involved. It's Story Mode is certainly a more modern-like mode, with you fighting a lot of NPCs instead of the main roster (In most cases these are head swaps) and having to fight with certain rules (For example, having to handcuff the opponent to damage them.For the $3 price point, I'd say it's worth it.

People complained about Street Fighter 2 having delay on its home console ports; I don’t know why you would bother simulating that now, especially since this game is obviously running full speed at all times.Aside from that small gripe, generic fighter with a good art style and decent characters.  The whole game is unbalanced and has quirky(read: no one asked for this and not sure why you would have them anyway) choices across the board.  Having to win 2 rounds for every survival match compared to your opponents 1, boss battles that clearly take and deal more damage than you, odd choices for win conditions…This game is just average in most places, having significant problems in small, specific areas.  Don’t really feel like the cheap price of $3 without a sale is really worth it.

After my attempt at beating the game with a 3rd character I uninstalled it. Completely broken boss with♥♥♥♥♥♥poor design. Geese Howard is walk in a park compared to this. Akuma? Seth? Shao Khan? Mike Tyson? Nothing on this mess. End of Deathbringer? Better design than this. Jinpachi? NANCY? Easy as 3.14. WWE 2K14 ""Beat the Streak"" Undertaker? Might as well be the Brooklyn Brawler in comparison.His damage output is so high that even when you block you're still taking what would be normal damage against anyone else and that's about the least of problems. On top of being entirely broken you either have to win with an arrest throw as a cop or win within 39 seconds as a criminal, which BTW if you lose round 1 by time over you lose BOTH rounds. Took about 30-45 minutes each to beat the boss first two times, one of those was on a 2nd run too becaue I also quit out of frustration on a ""survive for 60 seconds"" fight, only managing it the second time because I believe the timer was lowered. Story mode is made up of limiting gimmicks instead of actual fights.Absolute 100% frustrating, broken (mechcanically, it's fine technically), unplayable, awful game. Not worth 89 cents. I had a better time with Clay Fighter 63 and 1/3, Ballz 3D and even Shaq Fu. Rise of the Robots 2 is still worse though. But congrats on 2nd place. I hate to be so harsh because the developer seems like nice folk on the forum, made multiple improvements (it used to be even worse, especially the controls) and the game does have a nice art style but despite efforts it's nothing but a frustrating, unfun, awful experience. I guess if you need to get angry on cue this will sure do it but I can't recommend it otherwise."

I got it on a good sale for .59 cents and even at full price its not a bad deal, I know I dropped way more quarters than that into Street Fighter 2 arcade games when I was a kid.Arcade mode I found to be pretty easy, I beat it in a little under half an hr.Survival mode I found more challenging since you only have 1 life and its not best out of 3 rounds.Story mode is kinda cool also for something a little different. Each match has conditions you have to meet to win rather than just  free for all beat em up. You start out only using  punches and kicks on the first guy, then you might have to utilize a combo or one of your special attacks to do damage on another, or you have to try and avoid the enemy  until the time runs out for example.There is no native Linux port so I had to play it through WINE. Any of the issues I describe in this next paragraph are only in relation to that. Windows users most likely won't have any of these issues!My only disappoint was  a limitation in WINE which doesn't allow me to use my X-Box controller to play it. This problem is across the board and not unique to this game though.This kind of game is made for playing on a controller, but its still playable on a  keyboard.I also had a few random crashes which seemed to coincide with getting trading card drops.All my cards for this  game have dropped now, so I am curious if there will be anymore crashes going forward. I will update this review if I still have random crashes. Otherwise, performance in WINE was good."
