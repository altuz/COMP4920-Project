,Recommended,449300,23385740,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,mhaeric,"I have easily put at least 1000 hours into Master of Magic over the years since I first opened the huge purple box with an eye on it almost 20 years ago. Likely far more. The Prima strategy guide was my bible. Since then, I've been looking for a game that is worthy of being called a sequel or successor to that game, but have had no luck.Until now.A single player turn-based 4x strategy game, most similar in style to the Age of Wonders series, it focuses on empire building by building cities through expansion and conquering. You take on the persona of a Sorcerer Lord vying for complete control over all the planes of existence. There is a detailed character creation process which lets you decide your Sorceror Lord's abilities and spell knowledge, and this has a huge impact on your game's playstyle. Unlike most empire games, your persona takes a very active role in shaping your empire, making the spells you know a very large part of the focus of the game. There are two possible win conditions: defeat your foes by completely destroying their cities, or cast the ultimate magic spell granting you dominion over everything.Things I loved from Master of Magic that are still here:- A huge variety of spells with a lot of customization for your wizard. This makes every game you create play very differently.- The feel of the game is the same. I realize this is subjective, but it really does feel like I'm playing a game in the same series made by the same developers. The pacing feels the same. The variety of customization options, while greatly expanded, feel like they're a natural extension of the original options. The controls are very familiar. Other games I've played that have tried to modernize Master of Magic have failed at this.- Combat is just as strategic and varied. I can't tell you how many hours I spent poring over the strategy guide figuring out to-hit and damage numbers.- The surveyor tool. This thing is just amazing.- Tool tips. For everything. This was a HUGE deal 20 years ago when this game first came out, and still is to this day.Things they've added that improve the game:- Customization. They added the concept of grouping spells by effect in addition to element, so now if you want to create a Destruction wizard or a Summoning wizard then you can. You can also mix and match elements with effects, so if you really like buffing your units with spells, but also want to be able burn your foes to a crisp then you can put spellbooks into both Augmentation and Fire to get lots of both types of spells, especially fire based augmentation spells. The level of customization this opens up is huge.- Additional planes of existence. Gone are the simple days of Arcana and Myrror. Now, every game can have from 1 to 7 planes of existence. Anything from the prime plane much like our own, to elemental planes of fire or air, to paradise or corruption. Each plane can be separately customized with the type of land mass and it's overall size making the size of your world potentially massive in scale. If you want a short quick game then choose a single plane with a smallish land mass. Want an epic, seemingly endless, plane-spanning battle? Then choose all 7 planes with large landmasses and settle in for the long haul.- UI elements. Most of the UI elements are pretty similar to the original game, which for some means that they'll likely feel a bit dated. There are, however, some more modern elements that have been added which players of the original game will really notice. Most notable of these are the spell storage and favourites features, the auto-explore setting for armies, and the city build queue.Things I miss from the original game:- A visual representation of your city in the city window. It was really cool how you could see all the buildings you created show up in your cityscape as you built them. It certainly made cities feel more dynamic as opposed to a list of numbers and stats.- Spell animations. There are spell animations in Planar Conquest, and the battle ones so far are pretty good. The overland ones, however, are not that great. For example, most of the city spells that I cast while out of combat end up having their visual effect hidden beneath the surrounding objects and terrain. The only one I've seen that is visually very apparent is the Strands of Power enchantment.- All of the information windows we used to be able to call up. Primarily the historian and astrologer windows which showed the relative strengths between you and your opponents. Also, I can't find a way to view your enemy wizard's stats yet like you used to be able to do in the diplomacy window.All in all, from the perspective of someone who is a huge Master of Magic fan, this game hits all the right buttons. I definitely recommend it."
76561198031150417,Not Recommended,449300,26731510,"Posted: 21 November, 2016",all,benw_h,"This is a game that is far more obviously the child of Master of Magic than many recent games have claimed. The ideas, rules, races and structure of the game could all happily have sat in the classic MoM - a fantasy based 4x game with a hugely nostalgic following, and rightly so. What that game did so wel - endless discovery even after dozens of hours, multiple ways to play, a huge depth of content - it really was a joy to play even years after all the graphics had become terribly dated.So Planar Conquest, by sticking so closely to the model has every reason to be a highly enjoyable game. Yet it isn't. In reality there is no one thing that makes it fall over - each individual element, from discoveries to make, races to play and spells to cast is there, yet the sum of it all is so very curiously flat. The UI is pretty aweful and very 'sticky' - by which I mean everything moves about in such a reluctant fashion, as if it needs a push. On top of this the unit icons are all way to complex for the size they are, making them all largely indistinguishable after hours of play, and then when combat comes (which is probably the best feature) it becomes hard to care about your units because they all look rather indistinct (even once you have learned how to move the combat map around, which is of course not the same as in the strategic map) and are even more slow about responding to clicks, that in the end every battle becomes a chore. Autoresolve, for once, reflects fairly reasonably the results you'd get by doing the combat yourself, but apart from the risk of the occasional catastrophic loss of the hero, what is the point of skipping what should/might be the best part of the experience?Ultimately it's hard to recommend this game even to die hard MoM fans.What's it worth? £5 / $7"
76561198006786190,Not Recommended,449300,25593373,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,Roberlord,"This is a game that I really want to like, however I find it hard to do so.  To me, it seems like all of the pieces of a great game are there:1) Different races, different armies2) Detailed casting system3) The ability to expand across the map and utilize resources that you find4) Building cities and managing resources in a Civ like mannerSo why the negative review?  The issues is pulling all these things together.  A game is no fun if the AI can't use each of these things equal or better than human players.  For example, The undead declared war on me and we fight back and forth until they send a large army in to siege one of my cities.  They should have won, they had stronger/higher tier armies, a good mix of healers, melee and ranged.  The problem was they had no siege equipment/spells so once their archers were out of arrows, they just sat there waiting for me to open my gates.  Why attack a city with walls if you have not way to take the walls down?  Its small unpolished things like this that makes me lose interest fast.This could be a great game, but there has to be greater attention to gameplay, how fun it is, and the details of how individual compentents work together before I could recommend it.I played the original Master of Magic back in the 90's...and on release it had plenty of issues too.  It was a great game once they fixed thier problems and remains one of my favorite to this day.  The same could be true here if they could fix some of the issues that break this game."
76561198006917383,Recommended,449300,23313603,"Posted: 31 May, 2016",all,King Doom,"So, where to start? by talking about a different game, that makes perfect sense.Originally there was Master of Magic, and being how it was a very popular game some twenty odd years later people got around to making a sequel, and that happened to be Worlds of Magic. Worlds of Magic was not an amazing game. It wasn't exactly buggy, but it was blatantly half finished. Menus didn't work, scrollbars didn't exist, the entire thing chugged along like a fat man trying to roll up a hill.Now we have Planar Conquest, made by the same people who decided to come back for another go. Frankly, the difference between the two games is actually quite scary. The first thing I noticed in Planar Conquest is the fact it goes like a stabbed rat. (For those of you who don't speak South End that means it is very, VERY fast.) My PC isn't exactly modern. Or fast. Or working.  It was forged by Ur-Dwarves from slabs of hand mined Obsidian in the before times. On a good day I can claim that 'it isn't completely on fire'. Planar Conquest however, everythings fast. Starts up, loads saves, processes turns, everything. Compared to Worlds of Magic which ran so slowly windows spent a lot of time convinced it had stopped responding, the difference is incredible. I'm genuinely including some sort of fell sorcery in the list of possible ways they could have gotten it working so well. Quite possibly the machine they used to compile the code for this game is powered by the still beating heart of a forsaken child or something, it's genuinely amazing.What does it look like? well, better than its predecessor. Graphics are clearer and easier to make out, it's much simpler to tell what is on the map now, and it also allows you to double click on visible features to see what is inside them and what rewards are possible. Actually, we'll just move onto the game menu's because yeah, everything I just said goes for them to. Clear, responsive, easy to use and navigate, it's all nicer. There's more stuff in the city screen, but that's because they sorted everything into its own section which works better. I also haven't seen anything with missing or broken descriptions yet, something that Worlds of Magic had a great deal of. I'm not going to check because I don't want to spend eight months loading the damn thing, but you could frequently expect to see fleets of UNIT_BOAT_GAL_01 or something floating by. Not so here. Everything has its own name and suchlike.What happens when you actually play though? well, the neutral AI seems much more agressive now - I've had to fight off several armies attacking my city, so no leaving it undefended for hundreds of turns like in a certain other game. I'm not far enough in to have met another Sorceror Lord yet, so I can't say what that'll be like unfortunately. I'll update when I do.Are there bugs? Well, the first time I fired the game up a pair of hero units and a cannon I hired vanished into the aether, but that hasn't happened again so fingers crossed that was one of those one in a million bugs and not a 'don't play till it gets fixed one' I haven't run into anything else yet. Oh, and the game has no problems if you tab out to do something else for a bit, like check the interwebnets. Or write a Steam Review.Would I reccomend this game? I'm going to cautiously say yes, and then go play some more. Hopefully the only change I get to make later is to remove the word 'cautiously'."
76561198014736047,Not Recommended,449300,33960326,Posted: 1 August,all,Alex,"A remake of a reboot, Planar Conquest is the second attempt by Wasteland Interactive to recreate the cult hit Master of Magic (1994) by the now defunct MicroProse/Simtex. So, did they get it right this time? The short answer is “no.”The game attempts a lot: 4X strategy (according to their website, “the best 4X strategy”), tactical battles, hero units, seven planes to explore and conquer, as well as many spells to aid your campaign; however, for all but the most dedicated fan, the game falls short of being good by a reasonable standard. The game lacks the balance and polish of what's available in comparable titles of the genre. Your quest to conquer the known worlds will be thwarted by poor balance, numerous bugs, the most unidiomatic UI I’ve seen in this type of game, and an AI that lacks command of the tools it has at hand.The AI and UI, for the modern gamer, are perhaps the most glaring errors. The AI lacks the ability to use/understand the spells it has at its disposal. Instead of improving this, the developers chose to just have the AI launch barrages of units against you, which results in many tedious battles in the form of busy work instead of challenge. While there is an “autocombat” feature, the computer doesn’t calculate player unit enchantments properly and makes poor decisions; so, at least through the halfway point, you’ll need to manually manage battles, even against weaker opponents. Likewise, any battle involving naval ships is forced to autocombat and it’s clear in these unseen battles that the program is incomplete. You may attack a ship with clearly superior odds, only to find the battle ends in a draw. In turn, the UI seems to be designed to make the player click and scroll as much as possible. Perhaps in an effort to make the game a little longer. The game feels like a port designed for mobile platforms because it clearly is. You see, you may have a dozen or more enchantments on dozens of units. Rather than have simple icons with hover-over and/or right-clickable tooltips/descriptions to maximize the display of information, the developers opted for a list format, so you can only see — at best — a half dozen enchantments at a time. Such inconveniences are mirrored throughout the game. Don’t even get me started on pathfinding…The developers have ignored the many advances and standards developed in 4X games since the time of of Master of Magic; and, still, that game does some things better than this release, such as use smaller icons for spell descriptions and spell management for the AI, which is sad considering this game was released over 20 years later and is, according to the developer, “the best 4X strategy.”While at the time of this review the game has been released under its current title (previously Worlds of Magic [by the way, if those forums exist you can see I called Wasteland Interactive would end up re-titling the game because of the negative press, a common trend in my industry after a catastrophic product failure, which ""WoM"" was indeed]) for over a year, the bug count is extraordinarily high. Some bugs are obvious. For example, certain spells will remain on the battle screen indefinitely even though their effect is over after the cast. There’s an unnoted unit cap and, rather than not allowing more units, the program will see fit to replace your older units with the new ones without notification. It’s pretty frustrating to put time and effort into developing a hero unit only to have him replaced without notice. This error is backwards compatible through save states, so you can’t reload and stop unit production to stop your units from vanishing. If you pay attention, you’ll also notice many spells don’t work as described and there are numerous errors in spell descriptions and some descriptions don’t match one another when displayed multiple places in-game adding an untended element of confusion. While updates still come — infrequently — a brief look at the update log shows the developers prioritizing the addition of more language support and expansion of platforms rather than fixing the game by squashing bugs and improving lacking elements. So, they’d rather expand their market than actually take a good hard look at the aspects of the game that don’t work properly. Whether this is out of desperation or poor instincts, it obviously doesn’t fix what’s broken and it’s simply stupid to expand the market of a product in the state of Planar Conquest.The spell effects are lack-luster. While Master of Magic has certainly aged, it’s clear in playing that game that a lot of love went into it. Here, it’s pretty clear the designer in charge of spell effects spent as little time as possible in Adobe After Effects or a similar program and used the ol’ copy and paste instead of, say, creativity. A few spells are marginally flashy, but most are copies with a different color scheme. Being familiar with such programs, I see cheap tricks used here rather than time, love, and dedication. In fact, while simple, Master of Magic threw in a little animation window when you learned a new spell, summoned a creature or hero, and had a pretty cool intro. You’ll see a simple intro here, which isn’t very interesting, but you won’t see any of the other stuff. You’d think “the best 4X strategy” would have such things, but no.There is a dedicated small fan-base that does enjoy the game despite its flaws. Many people, including myself, have awaited a good derivative to Master of Magic; which, in my opinion, hasn’t come. Still, this is the closest thing. Unfortunately, for all but the most desperate, or forgiving this game falls short of the mark. You’ll see people posting things like “Master of Magic had bugs when it was released;” which is true, but this is a telling statement and certainly doesn’t excuse the flaws and bugs within this game, especially when reviewing the priorities of the developers in their patches. If you’re really desperate to try it out, wait a few weeks and you can probably catch it on sale for around $5.00 (USD) as the game is frequently on sale, despite its usual $20 price tag.Whether due to laziness or a lack of skill on the part of the development team, this game falls short of being a good — or truly complete — successor to Master of Magic; however, on the positive, limited modding support was added in the last patch. If that continues, perhaps dedicated community members will take up the torch that the Wasteland Interactive team has dropped. Until then, this game is below average when compared to similar games released today. Regardless, it’s certainly not “the best 4X strategy.” Not by a bloody long shot.**/5"

This is basically the same game without the bugs and crashes. When I saw it was being released on May 30th I couldn't wait to finally play the game I bought a year ago without the annoying crashes and bugs. I can say, I was not disappointed. The game runs quite smooth. Of course there's room for improvement but it provides a good gameplay experience. Too bad my exam period is starting now :'("

Has a very nice Dungeons and Dragons feel. Have had no crashes and the controls and UI aren't too bad. Not great but that's prolly because it can be played on a tablet also.I am playing with the grey elves and there is a nice unit and spell selection. It does have that only one more turn feel so far. AI seems pretty good so far also.

76561197989776377,Recommended,449300,24541576,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Dunhart,"A faithful recreation of Master of Magic. Could have left a few aspects of the old game out of this one, though.Like the slightly unintuitive controls. A fun drinking game: play literally ANY other turn-based strategy game out there before trying this one and take a shot everytime you accidentally move your current unit stack while trying to select the next one. Splitting stacks is also way more complicated than it needs to be.Or the bugs, like getting stuck in an endless combat or AI's turn. Your people apparently have trouble remembering what they're supposed to do as well because everytime I look the townsfolk I've assigned to research have reverted to doing labour.Speaking of the AI, it's laughably juvenile; Diplomacy is even a bigger joke than it was in MoM and the AI players have no discernible ""personality"" and will instead immediately go for you, and apparently ONLY you, at the earliest chance. Sometimes before you even get to meet them, as in both of the games I've played so far I've had AI players I hadn't met yet start casting offensive global enchantments like Armageddon specifically targeting my plane of origin while none of the other players had any presence there.And the magic interface that shows said enchantments is a complete mess. In MoM, when a player cast a global enchantment you were treated to a snazzy notification with theme music. In this game they scoop by unnoticed without any animation and your first sign of trouble usually comes well after the fact. And stupidly, the magic section groups ALL active spells together so trying to find the world-shattering spells from all the +1d4 to acid damage unit enchantments the AI apparently throws away like candy (with what mana income one might ask) becomes an annoying chore.---Still, it's the closest one can get to Master of Magic so on nostalgia alone, I give it a thumbs up."
,Recommended,449300,24799265,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,devnull,"I have waited patiently for this game to become ready for prime-time.  Despite many bugs and a truly absymal initial release (of the predecessor game Worlds of Magic a couple years ago), I've managed to put hundreds of hours into this game (and it's predecessor).  Obviously, I think it's a great game.   Many have tried to make a good successor to Master of Magic, but none have truly succeeded at capturing the feel of MoM.  Age of Wonders came the closest, but not until Planar Conquest has the vision truly been realized, imho.  If you're looking for a worthy successor to MoM, this is the game.My only real complaints with the game are slight balance issues.  Ranged attacks are a bit too important - and thus grey elves are much easier to start with than any other race, imo.  However, any race is playable after a while as things even out once you start getting cities of all the races, getting good summons, higher-powered troops, etc.I also wish heroes were a bit more powerful early on.  While they can be great with good equipment and levels, they start off pretty weak.  Honestly, though, that's probably a personal preference issue rather than an issue with the game itself.Anyway, I love this game and really congratulate the devs with sticking with the initial release woes of Worlds of Magic and continuing to improve the game to the point where it's really a very good game.  The devs have been actively working on this game for years and at this point, the level of polish truly shows.   Despite it's rocky start, this game really has become one of my favorites of all time."

Recommended on sale and only to the fans of fantasy strategies.Review 5/10:Planar Conquest is the same type of 4x as Endless legend, Fallen Enchantress, Warlock - Master of the Arcane and so forth.While the game looks good on screenshots and has many positive reviews, there are certain things that are not obvious before you start playing, which ultimately contribute to this game being rather annoying.Graphics: 6/10At first, the colourful graphics can be inviting.However, this is just a paint over a dirt wall. There are things done well, but there are plenty which aren't.Major issues in this game are as follows:- camera angle. Looks like 45 degrees to the right and 55 degrees towards the ground. This makes navigating map and minimap really annoying. You can't change the angle, so this is how you have to play.- the above on huge map settings with all 8 planes turned on makes the game very difficult to navigate and it is easy to get lost. Recommend medium map size for starters- UI. It is both colourful and clunky, both empty and crowded at the same time. Some informations are not present where you would expect it (like hero class and abilities in equipment screen), some is duplicated (like skill tier of your character which is next to skill bar, aparently people can no longer count to 9).- The above makes both navigating the game and reading important information really straining in the beginning. Takes time to get used to.- Different planes have too little variety to it. Forests are made of trees usually, grass is green etc. There are no spectacular differences, like some obsidian hill on the plane of Earth.- also units graphics are messy and subject to cell shading, which makes them look as cartoon dolls against the map.Sound: 4/10Absolutelly atrocious. Music is terrible and unit sounds are just as bad. Also it seems hit and death sounds are shared between all units, so your orcs die screaming just as your humans.I give it +4 because there are no VA inside of the game, which considering how bad sound is, is actually a good thing.Gameplay: 5/10Well, you play as one of the archmages trying to conquer the world. Not bad, but here are the problems:- factions have very little difference to them. Apart from graphics and rather low unit selection, they differ in production and unrest per population as well as growth speed.- *Terribly* imbalanced. Some higher tier units cost so much in terms of production and upkeep but can be totally inferior towards summons/lower tier units. The same goes to buildings, their upkeep costs are so immense it is easy to run into negative balance.- Overall mechanics is cr4ppy as well. You will constantly run out of gold and mana, because, guess what, even tho mana is used for everything (upkeep, summoning, crafting, buffing units), but there is NO BUILDING which would generate mana!- There is this property, called ""Power"" which you gain every turn and it is spent on research, mana generation and Spellcraft. Research helps you to discover new spells (there are no units/buildings upgrades to research!). Mana generation generates certain amount of mana each turn, but the amounts you get versus the amount you need for a single battle (to casts spells for example) or buffs upkeep is ridiculous.- You can build siphons on power nodes to improve the above, but nodes are guarded by monsters that are often many levels above your units and can one-hit kill them. You can win the battle by using spells, but you need mana to cast them, you need power to get more mana etc. This creates vicious cirlcle.- Heroes can wear equipment. However game uses no ""enhancement slots"", but instead you can put all enhancements on an item. Which sounds cools, but the cost increases exponentially with every new enhancement. This makes it possible to order crafting of an item costing absurd amount of mana and taking thousands of turns to complete.- There are no real solutions to the above problems. Either you spam cities and select a few to be centres of your unit production and spam cheap units, sacrificing them in the process of exploration, or you simply don't play this game. Buffing units is cool and stuff, but mana upkeep is way too tall for creating even a single super-unit, so buffs are usually reserved for heroes.- Speaking of heroes, they are random and you can't really order a hero, unless you use ""Heroism"" buff which cost 12 mana per turn in upkeep.- Level cap. There is some insane level cap in this game. Your units are capped at level 10, your heroes at level 15. Why the fukk is it even the case? Your mage hero starts at level 5 and gains skill/spell every two levels. Why is that? Why you even have to choose between getting spell or skill?- There are no ways to improve your units outside buffs, except for very few and very rare resources like mithril or adamantium.Bonus from them is local (per city) which means that if during map generation you will have a single tile of it in the desert, this city will never be able to produce good units quickly.- There are almost no ways to teach heroes particular skills or spells, except for few random events after killing guardians.- At maximum, there are only 8 players on the map.- World features that you fought so hard to liberate from guardians do nothing for a city. Having a Fountain of Youth does not increase happines or population growth for example.- You are limited to 6 heroes tops and they do not provide any bonuses to the cities.There are also outstanding bugs in this game, like achievements not unlocking, or assigned population reseting to default farmer occupation.Conclusion:With nonsensical game mechanics and annoying map, this isn't game that will give you enough fun to keep you entertained for long.If really wanting to play it, wait for sale of at least -50%."

The gameplay, UI, mechanics etc.. all take a bit of time to get used to, but I was able to get into it and didn't find it too difficult - though I have only played with a premade Lord, and on one of the lower difficulties.It seems like this game is a marathon, not a short walk in the park with very extensive and detailed custom options, and multiple plains to play around with. If you're a fan of 4x games with D&D flavour and mechanics, and you're prepared to give this game the time to shine, then I recommend you give it a go.What this game currently lacks IMHO are more detailed  diplomacy interactions - interaction with other lords is almost non-existant in the few hours I've had with the game.  Maybe a bit of civilization style interaction wouldn't go astray.  It also lacks flavour and lore text and context.  Still it is a charming game none the less."

Mostly, it's about bugs. I haven't seen any critical ones, but there are a lot of small and annoying ones. And AI is just non-existent.

They even have a premade wizard named R'jak because of course they do. If you never played Master of Magic, it's the granddaddy of fantasy 4x strategy games. Like Civ before it, it pretty much invented it's own genre and games like Fallen Enchantress and Worlds of Magic have been trying to ape it ever since but never quite getting there. After I play it a few more hours I will update this with a more in depth review. So far my recommendation is if you are looking for modern Master of Magic this may just be as close as you are going to get. If you have no idea what in the world I have been babbling about for this entire lengthy paragraph then you should give it a go if you enjoyed games like fallen enchantress (Or if you didn't because, as I said earlier, it never quite got there)."

Their first stab didn't go over so well so I waited once I heard they were making Planar Conquest and I am really enjoying it now. The races are interesting and the units are too. It takes a bit to get started (at least it did for me) but now things are in full swing and I'm enjoying the city management and conquering the natives while I prepare to invade the planes. Looking forward to many hours on this one.

Anyone familiar with Simtex's 1996 masterpiece will be able to start up a game and play with virtually no learning curve.The most significant change to game play is produced by expansion from two planar levels to eight and the subsequent potential for games with more geographic scope and terrain variety than the original. The graphics are colorfully reminiscent of MoM's VGA splendor and roughly on a par with state-of-the-art circa Civ III. Points have to be taken away for poor animations. Best not to zoom in too close on the action. The music is pleasant, unobtrusive and won't impale itself into your brain even after many hours of game play.As often happens with remakes, while the mechanics match the original, some of the animal spirit is lacking. At the end of an epic game of MoM, I felt like I'd just fashioned my own Tolkienesque trilogy. At the end of a game of Planar Conquest, I think, ""Well, that was enjoyable."" Which, to give it due credit, is a lot better than the thoughts running through my mind with a lot of other 4x games.One big caveat is the possibility of serious lag on some machines. I played on an all-in-one touch screen that met all the system requirements with no problems. However on a desktop that substantially exceeded the recommended hardware standards, the lag, disappearing mouse pointer and recurring need to restart the game were maddening.I rate the game a good fit for MoM diehards, a reasonably enjoyable game for fans of turn-based 4x and a quick refund if your system experiences an allergic reaction to the best efforts of the game's programming wizards"

YES Planar Conquest is a faithful conversion to modern times.PC remains rather close to the original MoM and although the setup of planes and races is different, players who played MoM will imediately recognize the architecture and balance in city and unit design. Spellbooks are different too. But very close to the original ideas. And other changes as well, but well... Civ4 was quite different from Civ1 and Civ2, right? The way to go would be to build yourself a horseman, set out and explore.MOM is the only game to have been on my hard drive for 20 years - where it will remain - but I do see a few reasons to adopt the new game:-PC is a solid 4x4-game which draws its inspiration from all the right sources-AI in the original MoM is over 20 years old and frankly just monstrous-After 20 years I grew very tired of enemy wizards spamming massive fireballs at my heroes. Doesn't happen here.-(not all important, but really) PC looks goodAlso 2 reasons not to:-The manual and game info are lacking. Also no good wikia yet. The lack of info is sometimes frustrating.-PC doesn't feel really finished yet. Could use more polish. I could elaborate, but it would be a list of small detail. The game is stable. After 15 hours no game crashes, but the game does seem to leak memory, causing it to slow down and for me to restart every -+3 hours. The devs seem active though, so I am confident that most will be fixed.All in all... thumbs up and smile.I will go and build myself another horseman."

Also some of these thought and ideas will end up in the suggestion forum.At the games current state I give it a 4.7 out of 10 But I truly think it has the potential to be a solid 8/10 game.First I would like to say a few things I enjoy about the game.I love the amount of spells and customization options with the spell trees and discipline.The amount of planes and the benefits or negatives each plane has as well as all the options to customize the planes as well. I enjoy that the races are all different flavor to each Ive been playing undead more then the other races.The amount of dewlings, forts , node, towers, gateways, inns. Etc etc. An they each give different things based on the structure. Ie not 100% random I know that if I go after a Druid Stonehedge looking thing(forgot the name) I will get a discipline.Love the different Resources available on the world map and how most are unique to each plane.Now what I find wrong with the game.First the way this game play I feel like its still very much in BETA. Bugs, Crashing, locking up, stuff not working like it should. Have to restart multiple time in a 2 hour session because of battles locking up, not finishing, spells not working etc. I strategic battle almost every fight so I have to do so many redo fight it get old real quick most of the time I end my game after a crash and wait a few weeks hoping they have patched it an fixed issues. In fact im currently writing this review 30 mins earlier than I planned because of the game crashing on me.Need more races though I like the current races but its the one area I feel needs more expansion. We have loads of spells but 8 races only.The UI is an absolute mess please allow user created UI or Throw out what you got and redo it.Spells section I like filter by circle but we need filters for Enchantments(city, unit or global). If a spell has no target maybe a reason why? Also need when sorting by a-z if I click it again it should sort z-a. Same with mana sort least mana then click again sort most mana.We need more info why things interact, why cant this be cast? Why does this not work properly, Etc. A conquestpiea would be great at this point. A list of all spells and the effects. It does not good to see the AI has cast all these enchantment but I have ZERO idea what any of them do.Heroes I only use for spells casting I have seen a decent Melee Hero that I would risk in battle to fight up close with any unit. Hate the items for heroes just so much junk I would rather fewer items and more powerful than 20 plus items that just are in the way.Xp Need an Indicator as to when a Hero or unit has stop gaining XP. Maybe even a why but right now the few games I have played is different for each unit and hero. Some seem to top out at level 20 some level 12 some level 10 Im not really sure Because there is ZERO info about it. And if they cant level anymore why even give them half a bar of XP. One they top out. Make the bar solid and say Max level.Sorcerer Lords should not be able to cast the return spell in one turn that means going after a sorcerer tower is just absolutely pointless.Mini map is a mess, It angled funny not any kinda flow to it. Also add a mini map always on option to the settings. As well has a battle log always open option In settings.ALLOW me TO TURN OFF Spell ANIMATIONS. Also in the log please note who cast the spell then on what unit cast (coordinates are fine as long as I understand them Ie letters and numbers on a grid in battle map).The terrain not sure how much food or power or production they produce, IE plains, swamp, dessert, and tundra to name a few I highlight them with the surveyor and they just say what they are not the individual stats they have.I'm sure I'm missing tons of thoughts I've been having about the game in the last few days but these are defiantly the biggest issues.UI, Bugs, more Info of how everything interacts and more graphical options and settings. Then it will be a 8/10 game. I will admit my computer is on the lower end of the power needed for the game so that might be where some of my bugs are coming from but still lots of bugs.Also as most other are saying the game is just Clunky"

I like Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes or AOW3  much better but this game has a lot of potential. This is the first time I have given a thumbs up to a mobile port, yes it was a computer game first but then ported to mobile and now ported back.PROS - Many different spells, items, styles of play. If you like this genre then you should think this is at least decent. The different races play very differently. I find the game to be pretty difficult which is usually nice. It has good replay value since most of the races are so different and there are endless spell/trait combos for your Lord. Heroes are nice and neat to get but the regular high end units are better until you can get your heroes all decked out in good gear. The heroes allso seem to have a wide variety of classes, skills and spells which is nice that they aren\'t just a few cookie cutter guys with different names. AD&D based spells and monsters.CONS - It needs polish. Many little things like errors in the game manual, example is one trait that says it gives units a +25% exp bonus when in game it says +5%, some graphics need to be reworked, example the summon spirit spell summons a spirit that looks like it\'s a pencil outline with blue color added, The AI seems to cheat, example an AI lord can have many cities, armies etc much faster than possible even if you play the same Lord on the same settings and try it yourself, that shows on even the easiest settings. Lack of options - yes there are a zillion Lord setup options but the game world and oponents there are not so many and even though the devs are actively involved and fixing bugs etc. they consider the game fully complete and I don't think that it is. The planes options when starting a game, you can only pick a maximum of one of each plane, what if you wanted a game with 3 paradise and 3 negative planes to make it life vs. death kind of thing, it's not happening, no settings to make the neutrals more or less aggressive, world events more or less common, can\'t disable spell trading so the AI's can sit there and trade ack and forth with each other to far out do your research. There are many popups which is great but they need more detail and more of them. I click on some funky shrub on the map and it shows a figure and an up arrow, I have no idea what exactly that means and there\'s nothing anywhere explaining it. Do I need to build a town there or just have it in my borders? Borders don\'t expand. There is no campaign of any kind, it\'s a skirmish game only. No options that I can see for your camera, if you have 5 scouts set to auto the camera will zoom all over following each one, maybe I don\'t care what the scoucts are doing and I just want them clearing away the fog, No option for the camera speed, set 5 scouts to explore and you'll have a headache from the camera ripping around to follow them, that's even with fast movement turned off. No option to set unit behaviors, like scout for exp chests or scout for mana/gold and leave the exp chests, can't tell the scouts to auto interact when they find unguarded locations or to even always fight like an agressive mode.So that's it. I think it\'s ok and I'll play it some more. I think that it could be a great game though with some more work. Even if they just polish up the little things and then do a DLC to add more options/content then it could be great. It is good enough that I can give it a thumbs up."

No quests or linear paths in this one like many of the others in this genre.  I personally like the graphics, animations in battle are ok (and fairly quick which is nice after a while).  The interface is fairly unobtrusive but there is a lot of info hidden at your fingertips (once you get used to how to find it).   Down the road, I'll figure out the hot-keys to move around the menus, but for now, I find the interface fairly usable... a little slow for me now, but I didn't read the manual and I am ok with that.   There is a good deal of help functionality currently (and I understand they are working on more/improving tool tips which will be nice).Technically, no crashes for me (W10 machine) and no noticable or major bugs to slow me down.   Game turns seem to move quickly (although I am only playing 2 plane, normal sized maps currently).The original goal (and why I purchased this game) of a updated MOM is actually fairly well realized at least early in the game.

I’ve currently played for 10.7 hours.The game is set in a fantasy universe in which there are seven different planes of existence. These are: earth, air, fire, water, death (called Shadow), life (called Paradise), and prime (fantasy equivalent to reality). Each plane is different in terms of fertility, terrain, resources, etc. They are represented in the game as maps (yes, you can travel between them). On these maps you build cities, explore new lands, research new spells (of which there are about 300), raise armies, conquer other cities, and so on. When your Sorcerer Lord gains enough Fame he can start recruiting heroes. They come in seven different classes with different sets of skills, spells and abilities.Who's the Sorcerer Lord you ask? He/she is you, the player. You can either pick a premade one, or you can customize one to your liking (starting spells, spell circle specialization, traits, name and portrait). Your enemies are, as you probably have guessed, other Sorcerer Lords. Defeat them all, and victory is yours. You can also win by researching and casting the “Spell of Domination”. You also get to pick what race you want to rule over: Dwarves, High Men, Grey Elves, Dark Elves, Draconians, Unhallowed (the undead), Orcs and Myrodants (humanoid insects).Some pieces of the soundtrack are quite beautiful and the art style is colourful (i.e. cartoon-like).

,Recommended,449300,30959483,Posted: 5 April,all,Rafael M.,"Inspired by Master of Magic, Planar Conquest is one of the most fun 4X games I've played, and I honestly don't understand why it has so many negative reviews. Gameplay consists in managing your city, founding and / or conquering new cities as you explore the map, research new spells, hunt for loot and engage in tactical battles. You can win by defeating all opponents or casting the Spell of Domination. For those unfamiliar with Master of Magic, this game is similiar to Civilization, but with battles like the classic Heroes of Might and Magic games of the 90's. The game use the d20 system of tabletop RPGs for calculating hits, critical hits, etc. Planar Conquest, which is practically a modern remake of Master of Magic, brings some improvements such as seven planes (Prime, Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Paradise, The Negative Plane) rather than two planes of Master of Magic (Arcanus and Myrror). All maps are procedurally generated, which ensures that each match is unique.With eight different races and 20 different sorcerer lords to choose, plus the ability to customize your own, Planar Conquest ensures an almost endless possibilities of play styles. Although the race's choice is the most striking, as each brings a different playstyle and unique units, you also need to choose a mage that fits the strategy you want to achieve. Wizards are what will grant you access to a certain type of spell initially (fire, water, and earth, for example), but it's also possible to learn spells out of your tree of abilities, although it will depend on luck. Spells to be researched are generated randomly. Even for those who are starting, I recommend the customization of your sorcerer lord, because those that are premade are all quite weak if compared to the ones you can create.Since I mentioned the beginners, I will address the elephant in the room. Planar Conquest doesn't a tutorial. It has only windows texts explaining each part of the interface. The learning curve will depend a lot on your previous experience with 4X games, but even so, this isn't a difficult game to learn because it's one of the ""easy to learn and hard to master"" games. If possible, play another game of this genre (I recommend Civilization and Warlock) before trying Planar Conquest; Not only because it will be easier to learn it, but also because the Artificial Intelligence (AI) cheats, and developers make it clear that even in the easiest difficulty AI already begins with a number of advantages, so if you know already how to play a 4X, your life in this game will be much easier. From the moment you learn AI's behavior in battles, everything gets easier, and you'll be able to do well to the middle difficulty (Wizard). In the others more difficult than Wizard, the cheating is so much that you need to play with much caution. But after all, AI almost always doesn't play with the same rules as human players, and this is even common in strategy games; The difference here is that developers admit it.Graphically, Planar Conquest is very nice and has a rather light cartoon style. And speaking in lightness, this game is exceptional when it comes to optimization. It's fast to start, fast to load a save and even faster to calculate turns, in addition to running well even with a ton of elements on the screen, unlike other titles like Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes and Endless Legend, who suffer with fps drops even in more robust systems. The soundtrack is very nice, but there are few tracks, and few of them are memorable, but it's the animation of the 3D models and in the sound effects that you perceive the quality drop, compared to the rest of the game. The sound effects are bursting and sometimes even unintentionally hilarious, like the ""death cry"" of humans and elves. The animations on the world map and the dimensional planes are good, but in battle they have an absurd delay, and in some cases it is even difficult to see if the enemy unit was hit or not. Even after months of improvements and constant refinements, these are some details that I would like to see improved soon.Finally, even with some caveats, I recommend Planar Conquest, as it is fun, very addictive and has a high replayability. Animations and sound effects are very annoying when you start playing, but over time it's possible to ignore a bit these details. This is a game that will be extremely interesting to anyone who likes Warlock and would like to see a deeper and more strategic battle system, and is as well one of the cheapest 4X games on the market today, with a great value for the money.Pros* Optimized engine* Game inspired by Master of Magic, but with a series of improvements* Excellent variety of content* Very fun and addictive* Affordable price for this kind of game (4X)Cons* Sound effects of dubious taste and even unintentionally hilarious* Animations with delay during battles* Lack of tutorial, which is bad for beginners in the 4X genre"

YOU MUST BE A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF WIZARD TO APPRECIATE THIS GAME IN FULL!  WAIT AWHILE UNTIL THEY FIX IT!  THE UI IS CURRENTLY VERY COUNTER-INTUITIVE!  DO NOT TRY TO BE HARRY POTTER JUST YET!====================================================================================I would give this game high marks in pretty much everything except UI design.  What really grinds my gears is that your mouse doesn\'t function like you\'re used to.  In previous genre names like warcraft 3, your mouse would work like this:http://classic.battle.net/war3/basics/specialcommands.shtmlessentially making most selection functions limited to the left click, while interacting functions work with the right click.I\'m sure many Americans like myself were exposed to the strategy genre through this game and other gateway games like it.  But this is so extremely different, it makes basic interaction with this game a terrible headache.I don\'t want to have to click a unit a second time to unselect it, I\'m conditioned to just clicking the next unit I want to control![/b][/u]I want more tooltips and cues like a changing cursor to show me what will happen when I left or right click, or target an enemy in the battle mode.  It just doesn\'t feel smooth enough to make me want to play too long, even though I really want to!I think the devs hit the nail on the head with everything else, but because I can\'t sit down for long periods of time wrestling with the UI or trying to figure out the nuances without being able to reconfigure anything or even see what my mouse clicks are going to end up doing.  I think the most telling evidence of this lack of foresight is that the input subscreen of the options menu doesn\'t show your mouse, just your keyboard!  They themselves can\'t figure out how a mouse is supposed to handle commands!Basically this whole game seems to have no bugs or staleness.  It offers a bunch of things to the 4x genre, but wildly deviates in more fields than it needs to.  I\'m too tired to take another whack at it, so i\'m just gonna leave this here for now."

My below caution to potential buyers remains. But again, this game is fun and I'm confident it will be all it promises to be. Would recommend.6/11/2016I like this game. I have about 65 hours already. The reason I'm not recommending this game is because it is beta/EA quality at the moment, *but* it's supposed to be finished. The game has *tons* of bugs. Some are ignorable and cosmetic. For example, incorrect tooltips and classic floating point number errors that get displayed as such(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems). Other bugs, however, interrupt the game. And they are bugs that, at the moment, I can't work around. Many bugs appear upon save/reload. Other bugs take place when heros level up. Other bugs when you switch between planes. These bugs result in units getting messed up in regards to stats and spell effects or the UI becomes unusable. At times, the only solution has been to restart. Now, even AAA games have bugs. Example: Civ:BE had this annoying bug with the airplane attack animation. What makes me consider this EA/beta quality though is that *every* game I play has some bug manifest. Something goes wrong. If it's something I can live with or fix by reloading/restarting the game, I keep playing. If not, I start a new game.If this game were EA, I would totally forgive its current quality. But this game was released as a finished product. It is not finished. If you buy the game expecting it to be finished, you will be disappointed. If you are ok buying the game with an EA mindset, then I totally recommend this game. It *is* lots of fun. And it will be super-fun once all these sqirrelly problems are solved."

I grew up with it, and despite all of its endless flaws, was truly a great game that genuinely earned its position as one of the legends. All the units, races, spells, enemies, cities and more are exactly like they used to be or better. Planar Conquest does not claim to be the successor of Master of Magic, it legitimately is the successor, rights and all.This is Master of Magic 2! This game is a faithful, creative, and impressive remake of that legendary game.Anyone that has played and enjoyed Master of Magic needs to buy and play this game! I can say that with conviction, the nostalgia is uncanny. Some of the reviews I've read state that the game has not advanced much in the way of graphics. I'm not sure what these people are looking for, but it's not Master of Magic. Claiming that some game made in the 90's had some kind of superb graphics is a little farce. The other main complaint I see is that recent games do the impression of the original better than this does; this is a fallacy as well. The fact that all 4X games duplicate what MoM did over 20 years ago pays hommage to its success and does NOT prove, in any way, that it is better. In fact, this only shows that MoM was ahead of its time when it comes to the stucture 4X games are held to.Wastelands Interactive has an amazing development team. We as a community report bugs and glitches and they fix them accordingly. They listen and implement what they can, when they can. Every hotfix/update that comes out vastly improves the experience. The game is continuously being improved, but my main point here is this: It is a very fun, stable, and rewarding game already. In fact, some of the bugs right now can be exploited which adds to the fun before they are fixed!A note on tutorials. They don't have one. For new players I can see this is a set-back. For inexperienced 4X players, a total put-off. I urge these people to still buy the game. Just because you've never skydived or played put-put golf doesn't mean you should never skydive or go play put-put. The solution here is to rely on the community until the issue as a whole can be resolved. There is talk in the forums to get the first guide published soon to make sure the new players aren't overwhelmed, regardless of AI difficulty. They have YouTube videos out that cover all the basics otherwise.It's only going to get better from here. Future content has been promised. My wife will divorce me if they get multi-player running and you all will be doomed. Continued support is a certainty. This is it, this is what we've been waiting for."

But tbh it became more a chore than enjoyable. Once you work out how to play, you realise the AI is terrible both at strategic level and at battle level.On the campaign map it frequently just sits lots of armies next to its cities doing nothing for most of the gameThe good points include the vast variety of interesting spells of different magical schools that can be used in battles or on the campaign map; the interesting system for gaining magical skills and spells ; and the many different kinds of resources that give different benefits to cities ;  plus the many adventure locations that give different bonuses, loot or effects, and the variety of creatures in them.You can cast spells in battle, or on the campaign map on your own or enemy cities or armies or heroes or units. This includes enchantments like giving a unit extra damage from fire or cold, or electricity, or poisoin, or lots of other things - or all of them together to make a unit or hero deadly in battle.The wide variety of special abilities and weaknesses that different units have, and the variety of skills and equipment (including magical equipment) different heroes can get are also great.Late in the game you can also craft customised magical items for your heroes. Earlier on you get some from clearing out adventure locations , or can buy them for gold from inns.You can also customise your wizard lord, choosing from different positive traits, magical skills and even negative traits that are disadvantages but give you extra points to spend on advantages.On top of that there are big differences between the different 'planes' or worlds involved. They differ in both appearance and how you can move armies about, as well as in the kinds of adventure locations and neutral forces you'll find in them.These include paradise (a mostly forest plane with lots of food) , prime (mixed terrain), air ( a series of floating islands of land that you need to find either flying units or spells that let your forces fly to cross between). There are several others including a death plane, a fire plain, water plane etc.Various portals and magical nodes let you travel back and forth between different planes - though they also let computer players do the same to invade your plane.The different fantasy races you can choose from each have interesting benefits from some terrain types and bonuses per citizen of that race (e.g elves benefit most from forest, have slower population growth, but provide a bit of power per 1,000 people in each of your cities each turn ; while dwarves benefit most from hills and mountains).There are many design flaws too though.The game interface has improved a but from patches, but still takes a bit of getting used to and can be annoying until you work out how to do things with it,The AI is ok at the strategic level of choosing where to attack and with what and what units to recruit, but not so good at the battle level, where e.g powerful units that are fast moving and gfood in melee stand and cast buff spells on themselves and other units for half the battle even hwile you're shooting them and hitting them with spells with an army of nothing but casters and archers who they would destroy in melee.(though for some reason it sometimes splits its armies into two or three understrength armies instead of one full one)The battle level is a bit biased in favour of archery and spells rather than melee too - though with the right spells that might be possible to chane (including enchanting units on the campaign map with permanent bonuses from spells)The economic system for cities could do with being fixed. Most of the buildings that get you percentage bonuses to a city's gold income have such a high upkeep in gold per turn that they will give you no real benefit at all, unless you build pretty much nothing except them AND wait until your city is at or near maximum population.This is less than ideal - as is one of the most basic buildings required to build most others - the Bulders' Hall - requiring 6 gold upkeep a turn.I did manage to get a bank and merchant's guild and high income from my capital in one game - but my captital was the ONLY city i could do that in.This problem is helped a bit by the option of setting cities to create trade goods, which turns all their Production into gold income. But you can't build any other building or recruit any unit while doing that with a city.You can still make a lot of gold from having some cities set to make trade goods - and in this game gold is not the most important resource - magical power is. But it's still annoying.Second, the AI has a serious tendency to spam armies at you from the middle of a game on, on any difficulty setting from the second easiest up. And if you think you'd like to speed the game up by setting production to be faster, that will result in doubling the amount of armies spammed at you.The builders' hall upkeep cost is supposedly meant to stop city spam (too many cities) and so army spam too. It completely fails to do this while making the economic system partly broken.The difficulty settings  don't allow you to separate how aggressive the AI is from how much it gets in the way of resources,Then there's the annoyance with difficulty getting heroes you want and which are appropriate to the fantasy race you're playing. You can do this by hiring heroes from inns (easiest and cheapest way - though there will be few available and little choice at any one time - so you sometimes have to wait a lot of turns to get ones you want - and the inns may not be anywhere near your capital or cities.Another options is researching the Summon Hero or Summon Champion spells (which you can also get if you're very lucky from clearing out adventure locations of creatures in battles for them). Researching them will generally take a long time though. So you may go for a lot of the game before you can get a hero. It would be nice if you could choose one at the start.Finally you also have a chance of getting an offer from a hero to serve you if you get enough fame , which you can get by clearing out adventure locations, and/or by beating enemy armies in battles.I did manage to get heroes i wanted in every game - but it took a bit too long to get them.Worse than this is the random map setup for Wizard difficulty (medium difficulty) and up - in which maybe one time in several dozen you'll get a capital with the right terrain for your faction all round it and some good resources, plus decent opportunities for expansion.There is not such a problem at the easiest settings - Adept and Mageling - on them you usually seem to get terrain and resources suitable to your faction at least on your starting plane.The worst thing of all though is that there is a Spell of Dominion which human and AI players can research. If any AI player manages to research and cast this spell before you defeat them, you lose the campaing instantly even if you were far into it and otherwise doing well.There are some spells you can learn to block it from doing so, but they require a lot of research points to get. There should really be an option to turn Spell of Dominion off when starting a new game - but currently there isn't one.EDIT - Even worse than this in my last game 363 turns in , the game just ended and gave me a results screen after i ended my turn , with absolutely no explanation of how i lost, or how some AI player won.Overall still a good game - but spent far too much time having to reload or wait more turns, or start new game over and over again to get a decent starting setup, and then to get the heroes i wanted."

You can only set the number, which caused many games of mine to have only 3 or 4 of the races, out of the 8 total, even though there were a total of 8 players, including myself.

The UI relies heavily on leftclicks instead of the normal leftclick/rightclick combination. It's not bad but you'll need a bit to get used to it.

However, due to the mostly negative comments, I chose not to buy Worlds of Magic. I watched some lets and play, but other than that I have been ""flying blind"" as they say in German ^^.Short version:Will I be disappointed if I loved most of the stuff about Master of Magic and are looking for a successor?Yes, you will. It does not even come close to the experience of MoM.Can I still enjoy the game?Sure you can. Just as much as you can love your wife, even if you are still sad about it not working out with Mila Kunis (or whatever girl you idealized in high school). It's just different.Details:Planar Conquest picks up on the basic idea of MoM- Different Races- Conquer the world- Be your own sorcerer- Explore like crazy!Pros in Planar Conquest:- Much more combinations of abilities and spellbooks. This is very important for long time enjoyment- Different Worlds (or Planes), also very nice- You need to use your head a lot more in order to maximize your value. Making sure that you abuse your food cap (if you are capped you raise the taxes, until your food becomes critical)- Better Unit Pre-Battle-Placment- Different Terrain, different amount of movement points required. This makes it kinda challenging. But fun challenging.Cons in Planar Conquest:- No Tutorial. It's 2016. A Tutorial can be expected. Sure their is the 80 pages manual, but I am a Millenial...- ""What the hell is this♥♥♥♥♥♥"" - This is the question I asked myself over and over. You are creating a new sorcerer and see ""hellhound"" and ""gargoyle"" summoning spells. You see what the spell costs (as for every other spell), but not the stats of the summon. This continiues ingame, in the spell book. Maybe I am just overseeing it, but it would seem like an easy enough task to add those information.- Scrolling thru the map, using your mouse, is a job that cannot be done, if you are using two screens. I play on the right screen, and need to use the keyboard to move to the left.- Movement system. It's not a problem, just really annoying and needs some time to get used to: if your unit used all the movement point, you cannot simply doubleclick on another unit and give it command, no just told your unit (the one which cannot move anymore), that you want to fuse armies. There is an easy button in the left corner, but if you are anything like me, it are the little things that annoy you ;)- RNG event. First game. Very excited. I just started research on an awesome fire spell. It was so awesome that it took 28 turns to study it. However, one or two rounds later my peeps found a scroll and resarch was immediatelly resolved. Now, for me, this is the bad kind of RNG. Make it like 10% extra research power for 3 turns or something like that.- Exploring is boring. But you have to do it, because there are treasures everywhere, waiting for you to pick them up. Just spend one point in cartographer and be done with it ;)In summary: it is a challenging game, that could be heavily improved with a few fixes. Seeing how this it the ""second try"" - I doubt their are gonna be massive fixes.If you are looking for a game like MoM: do not buy. You wil be disappointed.If you look for a mix of MoM and Might & Magic , but without and interesting backstory / side story, you can invest the money and see for yourself. If you have a limited budget as far as game are concerned, go back to MoM and do not buy."

,Recommended,449300,29202571,Posted: 12 January,all,Thewizardlord,"A true Master of Magic successor but with poorer UISeePlanar Conquest as a MOM sequelfor a long review.Update 24th July 2017It's has been 14 months since the PC version launch and the creators of PC continue to slowly improve the game. As I write this in July 2017, they released a major update with mouse interaction allowing the more traditional left click to select unit, right click to move to square system as opposed to the original left click to select and move. This was a huge problem and it's now fixed. Some modding has also been added amd there is no sign the patches are stopping. I'm impressed! This game is slowly inching towards greatness and the UI might even become decent if they keep this up.If you are a person who is a fan of the classic Master of Magic, and suffered through claimed spiritual successors like Age of Wonders series and Elemental/Fallen enchantress/Legendary Heroes without finding satisfaction, Planar Conquest is the game you should at least try (even if on a sale)It's the most faithful translation of the original MOM game mechanics you will ever find. Insane number of spells with diverse effects? (300+) check. Mechanic of dividing power between research spells/skill/mana? Check. Crafting of items? Check. Super customizable wizard setup? Check. You not only get to select the equivalent of ""Spell books"" and ""Retorts"" in MOM but also negative ""Retorts"" (they are called disciplines) like Butcher (+100% additional loss in population when conquering cities) or Ascetic (you cannot store more than 1,000 gold), that gain you picks/points to add abilities.The similarity goes down to the level of spell names and effects. MOM old main stays like web, doombolt, Time stop they are all there.It also expands the original game with up to the ability to play with 7 planes. You can customize almost every aspect of the game, from size of lands, whether you get one land mass, a few or many. You can have double movement by default or speed up the game further by speeding up to 4x the speed of researching, crafting and building city improvements.In the spirit of bigger is better, you can have up to 6 opponents (instead of 4), there are 12 spell circles consisting of ""effect circles"" - Destruction, biomancy, protection, augmentation, Summoning, Mentalism) and 6 ""elemental circles"" (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Life, Death) and you buy spell books or ranks in these 12 circles (you can even get Life and Death if you like unlike in MOM).Most spells fall into 2 circles, so for example, a spell like Guardian wind that protects units from all mundane missiles is both a Protection as well as a Air spell at Level 4. So if you have either Protection 4, Air 4 or Protection 2 & Air 2 and other combos you get access to that spell via research.Spells are in 9 tiers instead of the more descriptive common, uncommon, rare, very rare.The only area where PC is outdone in terms of choices is in the races you can control. In MOM you had 9 Arcana races (e.g High men, High elves, Halflings) and 5 Myrrans races (e.g dark elves, dwarves). In Planar conquest you get to pick only 8 races. But you do get the classic ones Human, Elves, dwarves, Orcs, insects etc and one unique undead type race.Turn based tactical combat is pretty much MOM style, except with the mechanic of getting backstabbed if you move away from another unit, or if you cast a spell or fire a missle weapon when next to a enemy unit.Another modern mechanic is attempts to counter city spam with soft limits.Add D20 mechanics with Armour class, Savings throw to Fortitude / Reflex / Will Saving Throws which on paper sounds good and you have a modern remake of MOM.Main weaknessesDespite how much it plays like MOM, there are plenty of disappointed MOM fans who dislike this game. Why?Firstly the UI is poor, but patches which have continued over 15 months have slowly improved this.Poor UI also includes lack of notifications when needed (remember to check the logs each turn or miss out that expensive sword you were crafting was finished turns ago for example), unable to easily dismiss unit enchantments because you can't dismiss them from the unit screen and yet the global enchantment screen doesnt tell you which units are the unit enchantment tied to!The game is also surprising bland due to lack of cut scenes (e.g when banishing a rival wizard, when a spell is researched or global spell is cast) . Cast a spell in overland or in tactical combat and you get boring effects if you are lucky, or in some cases nothing leaving you to wonder if the spell was cast.ConclusionDespite all these flaws, this MOM fan has been hooked by this game.The current game I’m playing is a 9 ranks Protection spell circle Sorcerer lord. I selected all 9 tiers for school of protection (there's also life school in game but protection works better) , got Protection mastery as well as Mentor (start with hero), enchanter (cast research enchantments city/unit/global -20℅), Warlord (units can reach 2 levels higher). I think I also got artificer (forge items -25%), alchemist (same as mom)I added negative disciplines (retorts in mom speak) such as Ascetic (max 1k gold), butcher (1k population more killed after conquering city), Tyrant (10% more unrest) and Heretic (50% less power generation from Shrine etc).The strategy is simple, crank out items for my starring hero, cast a ton of protection spells on it and go to town. Spells like Circle of Protection (+5 AC, +10 mundane resistance which blocks 10 points of mundane damage) makes my hero nearly immune to any damage by normal units whose weapons are not enhanced by elements or magic. Very powerful units that do a lot of mundane damage can still overload a mundane resist of 10 by doing more than 10 damage, but load up items that add to that and problem is solved.I'm having a blast!For people expecting modern innovative game mechanics should stay clear.

76561198083147679,Not Recommended,449300,28902429,Posted: 1 January,all,SinWithin,"This game was a huge disappointment as it promised to deliver something unique and failed abysmally. As a big fan of 4x4 turn based strategy I'm always looking for a game that has something new or unique to bring to the table, because otherwise, why bother you know. Here follows the break down of where this game, and I can only assume its predecessor MoM, went wrong.The seven worlds - This was the main selling point for me, as no other game offers this. I mean wow, seven planes of existence, what a cool idea, what a breeding ground for creative and imaginative creatures/terrain/resources and methods of play. What a wasted opportunity. Basing the worlds on the elements was a complete cop out, so boring, especially when the intercatable map 'features' boasted by the game remain the same regardless of what plane your on, as do the creatures you meet. The resources differ a little but not enough for my taste, not nearly enough plane specific attention to detail to really show case this games one and only unqiue aspect. The mechanics of each plane are pretty much identical, save for food, which is a pretty boring mechanic to hinge an entire plane of existence on. And that really is it. The Corrputed plane has no food at all sure, and the air/water planes are slightly more difficult to get around in, but thats it. Everything else this game has, others have and have done better, so losing out on this, well, ranks it below every other game out there.The Combat - Reading other reviews it seems that this was suppossed to be the focus of the game, but you wouldn't know it playing the game. Units take ages to recruit into an army (the game should have allowed you to recruit multiple units in a city per turn) and they die in moments, meaning you spend eons building up and manuouvering armies only to have them wiped out in 10 mins of game play. This would be ok if the statecraft or world exploration was more interesting/in depth, but they are not. In battle the maps are a lack lustre grid format seen in countless other games with no interesting or tactic altering terrain, so bland as hell. The units are not overly imaginative, pretty basic, and the graphics of the battles, while far from awful, are pretty far from spectacular as well. If fighting was the focus of this game, it was a swing and a miss.The Races - Prosiac beyond imagining. The standard fantasy options, save for the ant people, and certainly not a selling point. Dull, dull, dull.The Spells - The game boasts an admittedly huge number of spells, but don't get too excited, as most you will have already seen in every other fantasy strategy you have ever played. Add to the fact that the Sorcerer Lord system (faction leader managment) means that 90% - 60% will be permamantly locked off to you from the word go greatly reduces the value of all these spells. While it does encourage re-playability to see all of them, that only works on games that are interesting. This one is a chore. Better to have reduced the amount of spells and put all that effort into improving/expanding another aspect of the game, such as the worlds or the races.Magical Equiptment - You can make magical stuff for your hero's, just like many other games. So again, not really bringing anything to the table here.City Building - Dull, really dull. You can't visually see city improvements, which is a pity, you can't build upgrades for individual resource points, the building available to you are woefully standard, and there are maybe 3 race specific buildings. If you play strategy games because you want to lord over a wonderful fantasy kingdom where various cities/provinces develope a character of their own, don't bother with this game. Everywhere and every city will be pretty much like everywhere else, except spread over 7 maps, making it even more tedious to attempt to conquer. If over there is exactly like over here, why bother going over there. And don't be fooled by the appearance of the plane changing, once you get over the visual change you rapidly see the mechanics of every city run much the same, reagrdless of race/plane/resources available to that city.Summation: Nostalgia appears to be the only reason this game was made, and it shows. Maybe the features of this game were unique in the hey day of MoM but no more. Its dull, tired and lacking in imagination. Its so generic its almost a parody, it promises things upon which it does not deliver and its combat focus could be best describes as a waste of time.I have only to thank the Strategy Gods that I bought it in the Steam sale so didn't waste much money on it.PS - if anyone does know of any actually interesting (by which I mean unique) turn based fantasy out there let me know, i'm getting desperate."

I had average expectation for this game, but considering they converted the same game play as the Original MOM, I thought it could not be that bad. But unfortunately, to my own surprise, it's one of the WORST 4X games I have ever played.It's hard to point out why, but I'll try. First it's extremely long and boring. There is simply no excitement like the original MOM game. Second the interface in cluncky. I always get confused with the behavior of left and right click buttons. Also the interface is slow, it takes a lot of time to accomplish things compared to MOM. The isometric maps does not help too.The map is bland and boring even if there are multiple places to explore. Yes the graphics are not very good, but as a board game player, I can deal with low quality graphics. MOM did not have better graphics. But the boring game does not hide that issue.As for the combat system, well it works ok. The spells like many other ""magic 4X games wanna be"" are bland, similar (Ice Arrow, Fire Arrow, Acid Arrow, you get the idea) and not that interesting. In MOM, the variety of the spell made each of them awesome even if the spell was more cool by it's description than effective in gameplay.So I was very disapointed. Warlock was actually more exciting than this game even if Warlock was far from perfect. It seems the best way to make a MOM successor is to do it myself (It's not going to happen soon)----- Update -----At the developpers demand, I tried to put more time on it. First the gameplay is extremely slow so I decided to use the smallest possible map, with minimal land mass and only 1 realms. Then I  set the speed to x4 to get reasonable building times like (4 turn instead of 20 turns for a building).It makes the work less dauting, I won't have to spend 3 years of gameplay to colonise the map. Because yes, I only have 2 cities right now and it's a pain to manage. Imagine 30 cities. I am always in shortage of good with little buildings that would boost gold. And I build a fishery to get some food and gold which ended up giving nothing. So the cities are hard to manage.I also have theses nodes that I could try to capture. Now with my selected army, when threath is considered low, I get defeated miserably. I managed to send almost 16 units in a low threath node to lose all but 1 units which had 1 hair left of HP. To finally capture a node with a Magic spirit, that takes 4 turns (other delays that makes the game slow), and finally get +2 mana per turn. 20 turns of work for 2 mana. I don't want to imagine the neccessary army size for capturing an higher threath node.So it's hard to convince me to play again, especially when this game is making my laptop heat a lot while not bringing anything better than the original 8 bit game. In overall, it could be sumarised as : Spells that lacks of abusiveness, game that is slow to execute which in the end does not make it addictive at all."

Since the hot-fix patch, turn loading time have been reduced (on my machine by over 70-80%) making the game not only more playable but now enjoyable as well.

,Not Recommended,449300,29234997,Posted: 13 January,all,Cognitive,"This is an RPG-strategy game, the Fallen Enchantress kind of game.You pick a race, a lord (your own abilities), customize the map, and start off with one city and a few units.You send the little army around exploring the world, pick up chests and find valuable resources on the map.In your city you decide what to build, with only the most simple buildings available at first.For spells you decide which new spell to research, and may cast spells if you have enough mana.One thing that annoys me considerably is that combat is awfully flawed.Auto-combat doesn't work well at all. The game says the battle will be easy, but you keep losing every single unit.Manual combat is not easy to handle either, because you can't move and attack in the same turn, and you can't decide which angle to attack from.Sometimes units are able to attack several times in one turn, other times not.Sometimes units are standing directly on top of eachother, or don't move to where you told them to.Also every now and then the enemy units don't move at all, they just stand still at their spawn spot until you kill them.It feels like a lousy joke.Information in the game is also too limited. Like sometimes you win ""Fame"", but there's no information on what Fame is, what it does, how it's a good thing.The game does have things I like, but all in all it feels like playing a lesser(poorer) version of Fallen Enchantress."

Even though the graphics are nice to look at, the game has its issues (see the detailed review from Sir Evans for example).

Not bad, but here are the problems:- factions have very little difference to them. Apart from graphics and rather low unit selection, they differ in production and unrest per population as well as growth speed.- *Terribly* imbalanced. Some higher tier units cost so much in terms of production and upkeep but can be totally inferior towards summons/lower tier units. The same goes to buildings, their upkeep costs are so immense it is easy to run into negative balance.- Overall mechanics is cr4ppy as well. You will constantly run out of gold and mana, because, guess what, even tho mana is used for everything (upkeep, summoning, crafting, buffing units), but there is NO BUILDING which would generate mana!- There is this property, called ""Power"" which you gain every turn and it is spent on research, mana generation and Spellcraft. Research helps you to discover new spells (there are no units/buildings upgrades to research!). Mana generation generates certain amount of mana each turn, but the amounts you get versus the amount you need for a single battle (to casts spells for example) or buffs upkeep is ridiculous.- You can build siphons on power nodes to improve the above, but nodes are guarded by monsters that are often many levels above your units and can one-hit kill them. You can win the battle by using spells, but you need mana to cast them, you need power to get more mana etc. This creates vicious cirlcle.- Heroes can wear equipment. However game uses no ""enhancement slots"", but instead you can put all enhancements on an item. Which sounds cools, but the cost increases exponentially with every new enhancement. This makes it possible to order crafting of an item costing absurd amount of mana and taking thousands of turns to complete.- There are no real solutions to the above problems. Either you spam cities and select a few to be centres of your unit production and spam cheap units, sacrificing them in the process of exploration, or you simply don't play this game. Buffing units is cool and stuff, but mana upkeep is way too tall for creating even a single super-unit, so buffs are usually reserved for heroes.- Speaking of heroes, they are random and you can't really order a hero, unless you use ""Heroism"" buff which cost 12 mana per turn in upkeep.- Level cap. There is some insane level cap in this game. Your units are capped at level 10, your heroes at level 15. Why the fukk is it even the case? Your mage hero starts at level 5 and gains skill/spell every two levels. Why is that? Why you even have to choose between getting spell or skill?- There are no ways to improve your units outside buffs, except for very few and very rare resources like mithril or adamantium.Bonus from them is local (per city) which means that if during map generation you will have a single tile of it in the desert, this city will never be able to produce good units quickly.- There are almost no ways to teach heroes particular skills or spells, except for few random events after killing guardians.- At maximum, there are only 8 players on the map.- World features that you fought so hard to liberate from guardians do nothing for a city. Having a Fountain of Youth does not increase happines or population growth for example.- You are limited to 6 heroes tops and they do not provide any bonuses to the cities."""

The programming includes one of the worst random number generators since the generic RAND function in the 1970s FORTRAN IV compiler. It also crashes about every 30 turns, so save often. The game seriously needs play balancing. Even on the easiest setting, none of the features are beatable with less than 12 top level troops. Random events gang up to a ludicrous degree after the 100th turn. Until it is play balanced, it is only suitable for the very seriously masochistic, i.e. those who get immense gratification from unwinnable games. I would love to recommend this game as it has some very promising features, but until it makes it out of alpha and gets some play balancing, I just can not. Other less irritating issues include choosing armies, (always right-click to release previous army before choosing a new army or you will have armies going everywhere except where you want them to go, and a mini-map that constantly disappears with every screen change.

It has a lot of similarities, and some really big differences.What I like about this game:It has a lot of replay value: I did 1 play through so far, and I didn't get nearly all the spells researched. I didn't play as every unit type, and I didn't get through collecting all the heroes.It feels similar to MoM in a lot of ways: Conquering or razing cities when you sack them, wizards trying to forge alliances, fame, transmutation, raising armies, building cities, hiring heroes, the spell of mastery, etc. You'll even recognize a lot of the unit names if you played MoM.The play world can be absolutely immense! There are several planes in this game, and each can be large and host multiple cities. This can prove to be very challenging if you are trying to conquer entire planes later in the game.Item Crafting: Like the original game, you can create custom items for your heroes to wear. It allows you to fully equip heroes, and to build them how you'd like. Pairing item bonuses with the skills learned through leveling the heroes can be extremely rewarding. Although it isn't as robust as the original system, it does add a lot of customization options for your heroes.What I don't really like:This game doesn't have an many races as the original. One of the parts I enjoyed most about the original game was how diverse each race was. This has some aspects of diversity, but once you've taken over a handful of cities, you've pretty much had a chance rule over all of them.Tax rate gets set for all cities. While this can be great for managing cities in large numbers - 25+ or so - it also makes it difficult to manage funds when taking cities. You may want to set taxes higher in some established cities to produce more gold, and lower it in newly taken cities to lower unrest. It's not enough to make me dislike the game, but it can be annoying if you sack 4 or 5 cities in a round.Loading errors! The absolute worst part of the game that I've experienced so far is the graphical errors on loading. You may make mistakes, and need to return to previous parts of the game. Sometimes when you load a game, the troops and terrain load fine, but no structures or cities can be seen. Typically it's fixed by returning to the main menu and loading the same save again. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it is annoying if you need to reload a game 2 or 3 times to be able to play.Initially leveling heroes is quite difficult, and they aren't as dominant as heroes in the original game. I loved having 6 heroes in MoM with ranged attacks that could crush an enemy army in 2-3 turns. The heros get fairly strong in later stages of this game, however the demi-gods of old can't be found here.If I were to rate MoM 10 out of 10, this game would get a 6 out of 10. Without the comparison this is somewhere between a 7 and an 8. I will play again, but it isn't as enjoyable as the it's ancestor. I purchased this game on sale for about $5.

I do recommend Mageling level to start.There are still some rare game ending bugs and tactical combat issues with some units hidden within battlefield structures.Other suggestions:A hall of fame and scoring recording would be nice.I would like to save customized Sorceror Lords.Allow custom quick start parameters and randomization parametersCustome Races, Heroes, and Itemst needs an Awareness spell too.Finally thanks for making this game. I went from playing this to the update of Master of Orion, which also has its issues, and back again. Nostalgic heaven. Next I would love to see a reboot of Wizardry and Might & Magic, but there are a number of similar games out like them recently for the first time in years."

This is a game they tried to save from a previous failure – which is  a double failure!  The concept is good, and the graphics are medium, and combat is good… but to survive you have to know the tricks – which basically means a poor balanced game such that you have to use trainers or go on line and learn all the tricks in order to enjoy.

It is apparently an overhaul of World of Magic, which I never played.  The manual and tooltips are uniformly poorly written and vague.  For example, the game states that each farmer in a city's population produces 2 food.  My city has a 40% food bonus and 3 farmers, but its food production is valued at 5.86.  There is no instruction on reconciling these numbers.  The designers obviously thought numbers were very important (they're flung about everywhere in the UI), but made no attempt to let the player see how these numbers are derived or precisely what they do.  The manual is filled with redundant, uninformative descriptions.  Actual, useful information is hidden or missing from it.  The city screen is an array of tabs and pictures that fail to suggest what is most important and to make it easily accessible.Symbolism, where present, is often misused.  Take the spell ""Bone Aura"".  The graphic is of a human ribcage.  What does that suggest?  Does it detect bone disease?  Maybe it buffs skeleton warriors?  Nope.  It raises your resistance to piercing damage.  Who'd have guessed?  The game is filled with these - names and references that give no suggestion as to the underlying effect or principle.  You can assign a unit to ""Autoscout"", meaning it will move around the map and uncover new areas for you.  Well, there is no ""scout"" command, so why call it Autoscout?  Why not just Scout?  Autoscout is for science fiction.  More likely, it is a programmer designation used during development, and nobody on staff had an eye toward the game's presentation.  Technical terms became game terms, giving the setting a distinctly software-developer-ish ambience.Planar Conquest does not understand symbolism or imagination or artistry.  It is not meant to be a fun game; rather, it is meant to be a technically precise game.  Unfortunately, the UI does not explain itself the way, for example, Civ 4's did.  Sorely missing is the ability to right-click in order to close or cancel dialogs and movements.Rewinding to Master of Magic, an old game indeed:  You move onto a dungeon tile.  It's a tense moment.  Will it be treasure or death?  A cheap, MIDI organ sting plays.  A heavily pixellated graphic unfolds.  It is Brax The Dwarf!  We see a gung-ho, bearded adventurer bellowing something.  He is tough!  He is short!  He is possibly drunk!  He is Brax!  He is YOURS!  Woohoo!  That is what made MoM a great game - it pulled rabbits out of hats and  made itself comically melodramatic.  As well, it provided good 4x play.Planar Conquest is a slew of technical details (often carelessly hidden from the player), but it has no beating heart.  It makes no statement.  It just is.Update:  Not 24 hours after I wrote this, the devs made some progress on two of the issues I was critical of - missing numbers and right clicks.  Not solved, but definitely progress.  They obviously are working for improvement.  The game is absolutely playable.  I still do not recommend the game due to its failure to understand of symbols and themes, reflected in almost all its aspects.  A game with no spirit cannot possibly be a spiritual successor to anything."

God, has it been that long. So it is interesting that I choose to write my first review centered on this game... interesting to me anyway.I suppose allot of that has to do with my desire over the years to see a successful remake of MoM... starting with the graphics which were most in need of repair. Sadly, this is not it (and I am one of the not so proud owners of Worlds of Magic). And while there are many successful fantasy/strategy games available... each with its own flaws, but playable and enjoyable all of the same... this game is not that either.For me there are a number of deal breakers starting with the graphics which are at best subpar and removes any experience of emersion. Moreover the interface is clunky and it is easy to select and move the wrong units. And while it may well be there is a game hidden somewhere under the hood, the lack of feed back makes this a difficult thing to discover, and given what I have already written the discovery process a labor that is in my opinion not worth the effort.Finally, as this is the company's second attempt to remake this game, and given the aborted effort of the first, I would not hold out hope that the flaws, which are serious and run deep, will be given more than a cursory make over.My advice is to save your money as there are many more worthy efforts already existent including the original MoM."

I returned this game after playing it for almost 2 hours. I've played every 4x game over the last 20 years, and there are too many good ones out there to put up with this horrid interface.  Main problems with the interafce:1. Unit selection / movement.  Believe it or not, once you select a unit, it stays selected until you click it again. This leads to the notorious unintended movement annoyance so many others described.  Also, you LEFT CLICK to move instead of right clicking (99% of these types of games right-click).  This terrible movement interface means you are clicking twice as much to move. It may seem trivial, but in a game that lasts hundreds of turns, that means that you will be clicking THOUSANDS of times more than you need to.  This is a major interface design error, and shows that the designers either don't care about end users, or they are not very good at UI design.2. No audio feedback.  Isn't it nice to hear clicks and other sounds when you use an interface? Isn't it nice to have audio notifications when things happen?  Yes, it is.  Alas, no such audio in this game!  Dead silence because the designers don't think you deserve it ;)   Note: I turned the music off (I always do), so maybe there's a bug here.)3. Battle interface.  I'm sure there must be rants online about the woefully inadequate tactical interface.  Would you like to know if a unit will range attack or melee? Too bad!  They all look the same on the board, and there's no way to tell until you make the actual attack.  And there's no way to make a melee unit attack from a certain angle so there's room for other units to get in there.The ""manual"" (cough cough) says that there's a way to tell if it's ranged or not, but I could never find it in the actual game.I never played the original version of this game from the '90s, so maybe all these poor design decisions are leftover from then. But I think it's the ""we don't care about users"" attitude from the current designers.  They let you know immediately that they do not value your time when you first start the game because YOU CANNOT SKIP THE BORING INTRO! Yes, folks, that's right -- these designers have decided that your wants and needs are irrelevant.  They are going to force a bad experience on you whether you want it or not.  Just that annoyance would be minor, but it's emblematic of the attitude which permates this game. And that attitude is: we are going to make you do things the hard way, withhold information, and p.s. we don't care about your time.And while these remarks may seem ad hominem, I believe that designers need to held responsible for their decisions."

With that said, the only downfall of this game is the AI difficulty.  Even on the lower difficulty, I get my face smashed in after about 30 minutes played.Let's begin by talking about the good:Loads customization to create your Sorcerer Lord with.  With many different circles of magic to choose from as well as traits, you can be sure that it will suit your style of play.Many different types of creatures.  Lots of times games do not put in enough different types of monsters, but not this game.  There are over 150 units to recruit and magical creatures to summon!Each map is procedurally generated.  Any time you start over or even visit the next plane, you can be sure that it will be much different than the last time you have played.Easy to understand city management.  Immediate feedback if you try to add another builder or sage and take away from your farmer pool.   Enchantments both positive and negative are listed for you to see on the right side of the panel.Fighting is not overly complicated and is easy to understand.  You can even cast magic on the battlefield to help turn the tide or save your men.Huge worlds to explore with many neutral camps to fight when you're not taking on an enemy AI mage.Now let's talk about what's wrong with the game:Actually there isn't much wrong with the game at all except for this one glaring thing:The AI controlled units are currently much too difficult to play against even on the lower difficulty settings.  They have me backed up into my main base after trying to expand with my settlers and I do not dare leave to defend my base as the AI will pounce on your weakness the moment you are 1 step too far away to help.It's not very fun when AI units are moving around your cities very easily and you're helpless to stop them.In one example, I was able to defend my cities from attack for 2 hours straight as wave after wave of enemies were literally throwing themselves at my defenders.  Little by little I was chipped away and since I continued to take losses, I couldn't do much else but build military units - this truly became quite a grind.  However they eventually were able to take my cities because their units became stronger and stronger until the point where even my main stack was overwhelmed. Again this is on the ""mageling"" (easier) level.https://youtu.be/hS6RKTY_DL8If you're thinking about buying this game and have decided to play this.  Be sure to put this on the lowest difficulty setting.  Get ready for loads of frustration as this is not how I remembered Master of Magic being."
