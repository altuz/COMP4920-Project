,Not Recommended,449440,28915884,Posted: 1 January,all,Matrix,"I know that the developer put his heart and soul into this game, but it's really just a raw game.I just literally died because - ... I dunno why! mew mew mew and puff - game over. And I have to restart the level from the very start. I just don't have time for this kind of 'ghostly' trial and error.The tutorial is still lacking some vital information. Like what that rabbit can build. I just see the icons, but I don't know what to expect from them if I spend all my ducks a.k.a. money on them.There should be a simple guide for all that stuff or something in-game that the players could read about. This would make this game much more player-friendly and inviting to play.There is no option to turn off the music but still to be able to hear the sfx of everything else.There are no checkpoints and levels are quite big, and if you die like me - from unknown reasons - you have to do the same stuff all over again...It's not that type of game where the process itself is fun no matter if you die or not. I would have loved if this game had the same level/checkpoint system as ""12 is Better Than 6"" game.Can't recommend this game even when it's on a -90% sale price."
,Not Recommended,449440,28921184,Posted: 1 January,all,Fuzzy Crumpet Nuggets 257,Literally nothing in this game makes sense. I have no idea what's going on. The confusing tutorial explains nothing and the plot and or goals are not explained either. It's like one big acid trip some cartoonist threw together. I don't get it. Was only 49C but I might as well have flushed two quarters down the toilet.

And has this NES game vibes all over it for some reason. It was not a great game but it was challenging and the maker of it didn't go tyrannical of what he was trying to do. And it has some interesting music like a hybrid of 8-bit, electro and some guitar.Even though I cursed a lot to maker of this game, thank you for your efforts ... c*nt."

,Recommended,449440,25298277,"Posted: 1 September, 2016",all,Shark^,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

,Recommended,449440,25152545,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Slayr117,"The big elk is one of the most unique top-down shooters i have played.The enemies are weird and funny, the mechanics are very unique for a top-down shooter, such as using a bunny friend to build buildings that can give you various things such as ammo and health, and other mechanics like a unique way you earn money (using hegdehogs).The game can be frusterating in that if you die in a zone there are no checkpoints or saves and you have to start at the beginning of said zone, but that is what makes the game fun becasue it forces you to think fast and quickly figure out what you need to do when thrown into completely new situations with different mechanics.Overall this is a very fun and unique top-down shooter that I think everyone should give a chance."
,Recommended,449440,34680637,Posted: 2 September,all,ed209,"Frantic overhead shooter with decent pixel graphics and a notable soundtrack. Quirky design that works pretty well. The total lack of documentation means discovering what each object does for yourself (a good thing in this case). Overall I liked it a lot, though it's not without cons; keyboard takes some getting used to - analog controller support would have been very welcome.. non-integer full screen scaling looks rough at times & some occasional bugs such as backpack key not working, stuck loading screen etc."
