I've only played a couple of games, but have seen no major bugs or glitches yet. Similar to Memoir '44, but the cards make it feel more like Heroes of Normandie, or even  Warbands:Bushido (both games I like by-the-way). For $18 dollars it seems a good value. What I'd like to see is the tanks on the cover, and multi-player...maybe in a future DLC.In fact I'd like to see more Commands & Colors games, Napoleon, Ancients, ACW, ARW, Medieval...I'd probably buy them all!I was wary of buying a product from Hexwar as they've recieved some pretty poor reviews for past  games, but now I've bought both The Great War and 1775 Rebellion and have been pleased with the direction this company seems to be taking."

From the visual dice rolls to the perfect implementation of cards for giving commands to the movement and combat of units everything feels spot on perfect. Even artillery is handled with tabletop excellence with setting up one's target on a different screen before giving the order to fire into enemy trenches or the open battlefield.Oh and did i mention the very boardgame centric rich visuals of intro screens and gameplay giving one flashbacks of opening freshly purchased wargame boxes with that smell that says minty new.Music is very well done adding a sense of tension and heroic conflict as one can just imagine infantry rushing the open ground in hopes of not being taken down by a fuselage of enemy fire or a artillery barrage.COMMAND & COLORS: THE GREAT WAR a exhilarating tabletop experience with the guiding intuitive hand of modern technology as your game master and host. Hexwar Games has truly delivered a priceless masterpiece with the amusing price of what we would probably have paid at a gaming shop.COMMAND & COLORS: THE GREAT WAR, BUY IT! PLAY IT! and enjoy the rare taste of wargaming excellence."
,Recommended,449460,29374869,Posted: 20 January,all,bdgza,"I have only played the Intro I scenario against the AI (General) so far. I did not encounter any card play bugs, or any (serious) bugs at all. There were a few minor things that might have been glitches, but they did not affect gameplay. Every function is pretty clear from the interface without having to read a manual. I was able to enjoyably play The Great War. I am familiar with the rules of the board game, and that may affect the learning curve. I am recommending this game based on the promise of online multiplayer being added in a future update, as I feel that is really needed for a game like this."
76561197968515916,Recommended,449460,29386359,Posted: 20 January,all,WereChihuahua,"As a long time fan of all of Richard Borg's Command & Colors games this one is a real pleasure to play for me. The lingering deficiencies of the system have been addressed by HQ tokens and some clever command cards with variable activations. So no more whining about how you only lost because you didn't draw the card you needed. Plan ahead, manage your hand and strike where and when the time is right. Good digital adaption from HexWar.Since it's developed in Unity I hope that eventually it comes to mobile devices too. I like this very much better than the digital version Days of Wonder made of the original C&C game, Memoir '44."
76561197993328106,Recommended,449460,29378404,Posted: 20 January,all,CopperHawk27,"I have only played the first scenario and so far the game is a great rendition of the Command and Colors system.  I have almost all of the Command and Colors: Ancients series board game exbansions and know the system pretty well, but found that it helped to go find the rules online for how to play The Great War.  The game has pop up windows that explain what is going on, but reading the actual rules for the board game helped me figure out all of the changes that it has from the system I'm used to playing.  If you have played any Command and Colors games, you should be able to get started in this game right away and it has some unique mechanis that really help give it a trench warfare feel as you try to manage your hand to get the advantage needed to make a breakthrough while avoiding the attrition from the enemy."

76561198035021318,Recommended,449460,29590859,Posted: 30 January,all,jim,"Although my preference is for Ancients and Napoleonics, this is a very impressive port of the board game.Nice graphics and a decent UI.Would prefer the virtual dice not to bounce all over the shop but to be more contained so as to be easier to read.The AI is pretty good but, ocaisionally, moves units to less than optimal positions.Not sure if it is a bug but the 'Box Barrage' combat card can always be played even when it is not applicable to the Command card being played and, in those circumstances, that combat card is wasted.Overall, very pleased and a good omen for the GMT games due out later this year."
76561198069730977,Recommended,449460,29508815,Posted: 26 January,all,TJD,"I love the C&C game system, having played the Ancients variety on Vassal quite a lot, so I'm totally biased.  This game is terrific fun to play, fast, clean, and really engaging. Lots of novelty and replayability given the variability of the card and dice system. WWI is not really my thing but this game makes even the Somme entertaining."

,Recommended,449460,29420593,Posted: 22 January,all,Alexander,"Though it has some bugs and a bit poor UI design that needs some work, it's a nice adaptation of the original board game. Dev should check what the dev of Twilight Struggle or armello did on their games. They really diid a great job on UI design and presented the cards, figures, dice roll animation and so on in such a decent, satisfying way."

76561198023829842,Recommended,449460,29740142,Posted: 6 February,all,Abwehrschlacht,"Excellent game, a really good conversion from the original board game. I have a few suggestions for future patches: Could I suggest that the soldiers in the units are given a bit more individuallity? All four doing exactly the same looks a bit weird. Secondly, the game ends quite abruptly, is there a way of being able to go back to see the final on-board situation? And lastly, the sceond menu screen needs a little bit more thought, the start menu needs to be a bit more apparent.Other than that, great game, well worth the spends!"
,Recommended,449460,29578552,Posted: 29 January,all,misternizz,"So far, pretty great!  For some reason the tutorials are killers, but my first ten games, I have annihilated the AI opponent.  I look forward playing this versus a human.. I suspect the AI isn't the smartest, but it captures the look and feel of the boardgame perfectly.. I should know, I JUST got it for Christmas (the board game that is).  Love this game, I don't regret the purchase at all. Bring on the tank expansions, fellers!"
76561198023247903,Recommended,449460,29594592,Posted: 30 January,all,crazzygibbon,"When I first started playing this game it was a wee bit confusing, lots of cards and dice rolling around, however a bit of persistance was well worth it. This is a great turn based game (good if like me you cant be chained to the computer constantly while you are playing)  where your stratagy is chanelled by the cards available. There is a bit of luck too and I even found the button to turn off the dice graphics if you like a clearer view of the trenches. If you like turn based games this is a fun challange without beeing too frustrating and I would recommend it."
,Recommended,449460,29620512,Posted: 31 January,all,SgtKelso,I would definitely recommend this game.  It captures the feel of the board game and is actually a good way to learn it.  The bugs seem to have been worked out for the most part by the patch 1.2.

,Recommended,449460,29385144,Posted: 20 January,all,Samael,"hmm.. i havent ragequited so far, so good comp roll vs. bad player rolls isnt that much of a factor until now. thats always my worst fear with C&C games.. like it pretty good so far.but i just encountered some strange card bugs as it seems.. hadnt those in intro 1 (or didnt notice) but intro 2 just ignored my infantry assault commandcard.. and a one of the cc cards (battle fury i think) didnt work either. not sure if its more of a ""sometimes"" thing or if its an persistent issue, time will tell.the thing that anoyed me the most so far, was the sometimes strange behavior of the dice.. terrain and units sometimes stop them suddenly (seriously, no boardgamer would roll dice into the midst of the set up stuff... we'll use a free space to roll.). sometimes they seem to still roll, but the comp picks sides already. i'd like a separate area for the animated dice, or an option to turn the rolling animation off.still feels a bit wonky at times, but at least the comp wasnt spared from strange happenings. i'm sure that will be sorted out over time.overall i like it so far and look forward for the tank expansion stuff.."
,Recommended,449460,29435566,Posted: 22 January,all,HeavyEyes,"My old review is below.  In pretty short order the game has been patched which has made some of my critques obsolete.  That's pretty awesome.I now recommend The Great War, but primarily to people who are already familiar with a Richard Borg game. If you aren't, go try Memoir '44 on Steam (the reviews are bad, but the game is free to start - try it) and if you like that, then come back and try this.  The core game mechanisms are similar, but with M44 you don't have to buy before you try.---I expect that my review will change to positive, but for now I can't recommend it - it needs some work.  I'm a long-time Richard Borg fan, have owned and played many of his games including Memoir '44, BattleCry, C&C: Ancients, as well as BattleLore.  Here are a few of my observations, things that need some attention:- there's a lot of icons on the main screen but no quick / easy way to know what they do.  No mouse-over popup or anything?- some unique colour coding schemes between Allied and German forces would be beneficial.  More than just tiny icons.- view scrolling with the keyboard is really slow.- the cards that the player is presented with at the bottom of the screen could stand to be bigger so you can easily read what they say at a glance.- if it's in the options it's not set to default : it would be good if the view automatically centered on the units that are taking actions or moving.  It's easy to miss things happening and that kind of sucks.- it's hard to tell what I'm supposed to be doing and when.  For example, at the end of my turn, there's no UI indicating that it's the end of my turn and I need to click on something.  Some UI clues as to what the player should be doing at any given time would be very useful.- the cards themselves.  The text is grey on a kind of cream background.  Would be awesome if the text was black - it'd be so much easier to see and read.- is the audio off?  I adjusted my settings and find that the music isn't balanced well with the sfx.  Music is much louder.- the dice fly everywhere and sometimes away from what where the player's viewpoint is and the screen doesn't snap to the result.  Why? As mentioned above, the keyboard view movement is slow.Generally the game feels like it has been focusing on style before substance.  Take a look at Memoir '44 online, that is a great implementation of a Richard Borg game (aside from the P2P approach).  I like the graphics upgrade here but I don't like how the graphics seem to be putting actual gameplay in the backseat.  It feels like so much of the emphasis is on the dice roll, how amazing it looks (and hey, it looks great), but the real beauty of a Richard Borg system shouldn't be the graphics but the gameplay.   And if you want to make it all about the graphics, then throw some realism here - I mean, grass-covered no-mans-land? What?  Trench warefare was known to be a boggy, muddy mess.Speaking of which, why only trench warfare?  I hope and expect to see some expansions (I don't want to pay more money) where we're seeing some of the many other kinds of battles in WWI - the battle of the Marne, Serbia, Turkey, Russia - there's a lot of opporutnity for some interesting tilesets and challenges that aren't just trenches.Anyway, I like the game and it has a lot of promise.  The devs seem to be responsive and genuinely interested in making this title better.  I've shared some ideas and I look forward to where this can go, but for now, I can't recommend it - espcially to people who are new to a Richard Borg game or this style of game in general."
76561198044128520,Recommended,449460,29687750,Posted: 4 February,all,cayugabooks,"A like the game. There is a steep learning curve, though, more frustrating than fun. Some of the scenarios from one side or the other are doomed to fail. There are some bugs in it even after the second update ... to be expected. AI is a bit too strong in my opinion. There needs to be an undone button for moving. Accidentally hitting a hex can be devastating."
76561198333990769,Recommended,449460,30670930,Posted: 22 March,all,kgeggum,"Overall I have been enjoying C&C: TGW so far. AI seems to be much improved since lauch, if anything it helps me improve my tactics for the board game. A few things, being able to accepet retreat (flag) results as in the board game is critical to postioning for big card plays. I understand that this would slow the digital game experience down alot and might not be possible. I hope we get the Tank Expansion for the digital version of the game, how fun that would be."
,Recommended,449460,29381867,Posted: 20 January,all,charlescab,Interface isnt very good. Music is lack luster. I love the game though. Will be good to have an option to setting up the board!
,Not Recommended,449460,29446764,Posted: 23 January,all,Minister Sinister,"I'm enjoying it but it's quite buggy.  The UI has loads of glitches and I've had a couple of unusual situations where the game logic breaks (such as a unit moving, then playing the card to send them back to their original space, but in the interval the AI has moved another unit into that space, so the game breaks and you have to quit).It's not too bad overall but I can't recommend it for the price until they fix some of the many bugs.  It looks like the developers are doing some patches, so hopefully I'll be able to change this to a thumbs up soon."
76561198085202338,Recommended,449460,34285467,Posted: 16 August,all,Katczinsky,"Will you prove to be a lion or a donkey?  COMMANDS AND COLORS: GREAT WAR puts you in the driver's seat for tactical-operational level combat in the trenches of the Western Front during World War I, playing as either British/Commonwealth or Germans, from the Battle of Loos in Autumn 1915 through the Somme in Summer 1916 and Vimy Ridge in April 1917.  The turn-based action takes place on a hex-grid map with unique terrain for each scenario, using an unspecified game scale -- probably platoon/section -- in which both ranged and close combat occurs, including off-map artillery and four unit types:  infantry, bombers, machine guns and mortars.  Navigate barbed wire, occupy craters blown by your artillery and miners, and claw at enemy trenches as you ""bite and hold.""  Win by acquiring Objective Medals for occupying enemy terrain, destroying enemy units, exiting units off the enemy's edge of the map, or using the right cards.  Play by utilizing HQ Tokens, Command Cards and Combat Cards, which limit your choices while providing unique capabilities to your units.  Success depends on the luck of the draw and combat dice throws, but more importantly, your ability to construct a winning strategy for the battle at hand using your available resources.   Mindlessly charging the enemy quickly results in defeat.  Victory requires identifying your strengths and executing your battle plan step-by-step in response to your enemy's maneuvers and the HQ tokens and cards you acquire.  The result is a game in which you must think and re-think your plan as the battle develops, often frustrated by your inability to use all the resources theoretically at your disposal.As an amateur Great War historian, I like this game a lot, especially because it puts you at the infantry battalion level of decision-making, dynamically responding to an ever-changing battle front using a range of options limited by factors beyond your control.  In every scenario you occupy the front trenches, facing enough unknowns that you will have to forge a bespoke method in order to accomplish your objectives.  Re-playability is high and there are variable AI controls.  Recommended!"

Selecting a unit should explain its range and number of dice rolled, however, currently it does not. Tutorial information is paraghs of fluff, that explain the design decisions and then proceeds to give very little detail on what the things are.The one upside is the game quickly put me out of my missory when it crashed. Did not even make it through the first turn. It may get better but i couldn't find out.Come back in a couple of weeks.Edit: 23 Jan 2017: Devs have responded here to interface concerns, and interface is a personal thing so we will see where it goes. Im sure if you know the game well it is sufficent.Also I do have an in progress ticket going re crashing issue and the devs have been very responsive. So that certainly is a good thing. They mentioned a patch will probably come out in a week or so...I can recommend the game, just not the present build."

It's the second time I buy a Hexwar game and second time I'm disappointed by the quality of the product (the firts was Nuts! Battle of the Bulge) The question is: Not enough time/persons for playtesting before scheduled release? I know that this year more Commands and colors game are coming: Come on HexWar! Let's improve!

76561198024944562,Not Recommended,449460,32692800,Posted: 23 June,all,RangerRobAZ,"The graphics are passable for a board game. The controls are clunky and feel slow. Things like unit and terrain information is only accessible via a hover and not at all times (like when moving the unit). The graphics also make it hard to see at a glance what units are on the board. The cards are not easily read.Overall it could be a much better game if the UI was refined a bit. As it is, I find it too cumbersome to deal with, so I will be deleting it."

The game starts with a gray screen after 2 seconds of showing the actual game starter page. If I remember the start game button location I could play the game for a few times and it seemed fun. But I could never repeat to start the game this way again. I contacted support but their help was minimal and communication has been very brief and stalled at the time I am writing this. However, was I inspired to get the original board game and its tank expansion, which are a blast to play. Would I recommend to buy the pc version that does not even allow for multiplayer yet? - That would be a big:  NO!! Stay away from this and buy the board game if you can get a copy that is!"

But I was not sure about a computer version and much less how it would work in a WW1 setting. But as I have an interest in WW1 I took the plunge.I am very glad I did. A well thought out and challenging game.The variety of tactics and decisions you are presented with are well thought out.I was surprised that WW1 tactics are so well represented. Assault over no mans land into wire could lose you the battle.Edging up trenches is costly.Use mortars to blast away the wire, rush troops into a gap, and then support them, if you do that you might pull it off.Excellant game!"
