,Not Recommended,449530,24796090,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,a baby duck,"I really wanted to like this game. It's silly, it has a Tommy Wiseau pigeon, and it costs $1. But some things are just broken.The entire game consists of flying left or right and pressing space to poop on things. Sometimes the things move, and sometimes there is wind, so your poop moves. The dialogue between levels is in broken English that is usually understandable if you take an extra second or two. All of that is fine. It's funny, simple, and endearing.The problem is the one difficulty mechanic (admittedly I didn't get very far) is wind. Wind makes your poop move, and wind changes direction, except it doesn't. Currently there's a wind indicator that shows you whether wind is blowing left or right. Wind always blows right, even if the indicator says it's blowing left.Also apparently it's just a browser game, because every time I hit F12 to take a screenshot (the default keybind in Steam) a Chrome debugger window pops up over the game.On one hand it's $1 and it's entertaining enough that I kind of don't care. On the other hand I just paid $1 for a browser game with one mechanic that doesn't even work."

Which means that you'll have to restart multiple times to complete a single level. The soundtrack is pretty good and the English translation is impressive!7/10"
,Not Recommended,449530,24842006,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,Jacq,"It's cute and funny. The art is great and the broken English is endearing. The 2nd or 3rd level after the tutorial the difficulty spikes and it becomes all but impossible.The problem is that the game wants perfection while having random failure coded into it. You're given very little room for error (12 bullets for 10 targets, for example - oh but there's a sob story about a little baby squab starving so actually it's 10 bullets for 10 targets). You are a moving object (a pigeon) trying to hit moving objects (people), Your bullets (poos) are affected by wind, which blows either left or right (you're told which direction at least). The degree to which your bullets are affected by wind is based on the direction your pigeon is flying, and the poo's own weight - heavy poos fall faster and are pushed by wind less, while little poos fly all over the place.The problem is that the weight of a poop is completely random and unknowable to the player, so ultimately whether a shot hit or misses comes down to luck. You can try to mitigate the RNG in various ways, like lining up your shots perfectly, or trying to aim for ""clumps"" of pedestrians in the hope a randomly heavy poop will hit someone you weren't aiming for, but ultimately it stopped being fun the 50th time I had to reload a level becuase a shot was randomly a different weight and went flying off in a direction I wasn't aiming.If the game were more forgiving with ammo, or more consistent with firing, I'd have recommended it. As it is, I ragequit after about 25 minutes (steam didn't record my playtime for some reason?). It's worth a buck for the story and art alone, but the gameplay stops being fun very quickly."

,Not Recommended,449530,34040710,Posted: 5 August,all,tenshi_a,"Not a very good game.It's cheap, it's full of memes, it's simple and frustrating and boring.All you do is push left and right to move the bird left and right. It's simple, no physics, left and right. And you push a button to fire, which goes diagonally left or diagonally right depending on the wind.You have a quota of walking people and stationary vehicles to crap on.You also have a very limited amount of poo. And if you miss, or hit the wrong things so you can't win a level, the game doesn't tell you you're in an unwinnable situation, it waits until you've used up all your bullets then tells you. Also it doesn't show you what your quota is on-screen so you can count them off.So it's frustrating. And simple. And not very good.Do yourself a favour and find a C64 emulator and a copy of Potty Pigeon. It was a much better game. It's probably 30 years old now, but was a much better, much more featureful, arcade game than this. The music was better too.This game... I have limited ammo and I don't give enough ♥♥♥♥♥ to carry on playing."

Sound effects are okay.+Gameplay: Ok so first of all this game has a nonlinear structure with multiple endings. You face the story of pigeons hard times, full of various memes with a Russian flavoring on top. Hard difficulty is hard because of the random winds, normal difficulty is still hard but beatable comparing to the hard one. Anyway, this game is pretty challenging.+Steamcards - make the game nearly free to play if you take into account the low price.+Steam achievements.-Game bugs here and there and you see the developers fixing their game at least twice a day with all those patches, I guess it's the early release problems, which will be gone later.Tl:DR - it is a good buy, the game is cheap, challenging and has a nice story."

,Recommended,449530,25462192,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Xpliciit,I bought this game with a coupon i received for crafting steam badges and i think despite its broken english text/grammar i would genuinely recommend the game to anyone.There are a decent amount of story missions in the game that branches off into three separate stories. They are all very well thought out despite the main goal being to pidgeon poo over everything. The missions are not all the same and vary a little with mechanics which held my interest for longer. Missions are also relatively challenging too when taking into consideration limited 'ammo' and wind speed/direction.

,Recommended,449530,34340113,Posted: 18 August,all,ICEBEARAID,"You know, I bought this game for sixty-six cents and I gotta say, it's pretty hard to get into it in the beginning. The mechanics of the game were basic: spacebar to poop and left/right to fly. The whole gist of it seemed loud and clear, poop on whatever you needed to poop on. The missions were difficult to beat due to having little room for mistakes, but after getting the hang of aiming and advancing through the game, I was surprised on how well the story plot went. Going from defecating for random birds to defecating for greater purposes of birdkind --at least when you reached a certain point of the game.The gameplay is difficult at first but pretty simple, and the depth of it is as good as it can with a bunch of pigeons (they do have a lot of character in them). The dialogue and references is amusing, and the missions are a challenge to play. I'd say the game is worth what I've bought it for. If I were to buy it at the original price I probably wouldn't have thought so otherwise. Besides that, if you like pigeons and activism, go ahead and get the game."

Very basic (but kind of addicting) gameplay with a charming cast of pidgeons bent on ""spreading their message"" to the humans of the world with some well-placed ""shells"". There's actually very little room for error, so I found myself restarting the levels quite a few times after the intro levels. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, and helps make up for the visuals. Sound was simple, but not annoying. Overall, a well-rounded game for the price, and something easy to unwind with."

,Not Recommended,449530,33856866,Posted: 28 July,all,Slice'N'Dice,"Got the game on a discount coupon for next to nothing as the pidgeon pooping on people intreagued me. If I had to pay full price, I would have not bothered.First impressions, I didn't expect much. The game opened in full screen and OMG, memories of the old 8 bit games (blocky) came to mind but as soon as the game was scaled down in window mode, it looked better. Next thing that struck me was the option to set your preferred language (English or Russian), a nice touch if it wasn't for the poor English but it's good enough to understand what the developer intended to get across. This can be excused as his knowledge of English is far superior to my understanding of Russian ;PThe game itself doesn't seem too bad. You fly from one side of the screen to the other dropping poop on cars and people.  Brings new meaning to the pidgeons ""coo"" which probably translates into our version of ""kewl"" when you get a hit. Pidgeons do have a sense of humour then ;)The game can pass the time when nothing else appeals but even though it has a bit of adult humour, it's more suited for entertaining the young kids due to the easy play style.The game has 15 achievements, all hidden until you unlock them during play. I will be interesting to see what they all are and whether they actaually are worth including!I can't recommend it at the current full price. It simply is too much. I would say 4/10."

Is it as frantic and crazy as the trailer implies? Not really. Basicly if the idea of moving around (just left or right) as pidgeon and crapping on targets (moving or fixed) sounds fun or resonable to you, ok, get it, because that's the game. it's fine for what it is, but that's really it. Just know beforehand that it is actually a bit more difficult than I make it sound. I mean,The art is fairly acceptable, this game features a tyler durden, tommy weassou and a zombie faux walter white pidgeon. Ravaging about a quasi communist revoltion of shorts, I'm honestly pretty shure there isn't a point in the middle of all of this, it's just the frist though the developer came up and ran with. Unfortunately the english is often broken and that distracts the reader from following the plot and story points.It also features some short of electronica as soundtrack, not my thing, but it's mostly fine for short bursts. As far as I'm concerned they all needed a bunch more bars in the compositions to make them tolerable from more than 15 min. The game does rotate them everytime you retry a map, but it doesn't fix the issue."
