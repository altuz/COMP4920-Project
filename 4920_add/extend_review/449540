I was considering recording this myself, but after the first 10 minutes of playing I realized this isn't something I would want on my channel. Don't get me wrong, potty humor is funny time to time but this doesn't have 'finesse' I guess you could say. I am not convinced they worked that hard on this, and the camera angles are verrrryy misleading..freeze the trailer at 15 seconds (if the trailer is the same as when I wrote this) and that is your gameplay camera angle (static 2.5d with side scrolling people.) This is the kind of thing that should be a free internet game as the dev creates a portfolio, not moneygrabbing off steam..."

The fact that you could poop on people is the only thing that the game had to offer and they take that away from you the second you start. The game is full of glitches and it's funny for about 5 minutes of the 30 minutes you could possibly play to get all the achievements and delete the game.There is 3 stages in the game. In each stage you will start by dropping a few turds here and there and as you progress you will unleash destructive bowel movements upon the unsuspecting population of characters that barely resemble human beings. You have a small variety in these destructive bowel movements such as firework liquid diarrhea and Mexican food landslide crap.Overall it's just not worth the $1"

Lots of orientalism and loaded with veeery racist depictions of Chinese people. I'm talking 1800s cartoon depictions. Straight-up looks like yellowface. Ignorant, borderline racist jokes as achievments. They have an achievment called ""geisha facial"" when geisha are... not Chinese. New York is depicted in a modern setting where people wear suits and drive taxis but in Bejing everyone is wearing ancient costumes, bamboo hats,  the old guys all have fu-man-chu, and people are pulling around hay carts.I get it, not all games have to be ""PC"" but this really bummed me out. Wanted to play a fun game where I throw poop on people. Was not expecting racism and orientalism in a game based on such a silly, absurd concept. Very disappointing.

What sounds like a pun of a 5 yo turns in a poopthrowing fest in the 3 capitals just formally known for daily poop rain. No matter the way you think of disgust you have to sh*t on ppl to gain many points. I wonder how Steam's extended language control didn't stop this game from the very beginning. It should be funny and challenging. But it's not. Most time you struggle of lack of precise controls. A thick diameter skylight shows your first impact/bounce zone. Then you have to estimate the flight time and bouncing curve. Your charater is honestly said a buttface. If you land a couple of hits new upgrades will be unlocked. Until you release the supersh*t bomb in the end or the 1min shower of brown soup. That's how I ever imagined a sh*tstorm.

I thought this game would be fun to entertain my nephew with when he was old enough to play a video game. However even he woud be bored with this kind of repetatvie game play. Sure poop is funny, anyone can appreciate a good poop/fart joke. The game is kind of glitchy as well. The numbers and people will start to phase into just blocks of color. For example when you see your score sometimes instead of numbers, you'll see red blocks on your screen.I'd say it's worth what you pay considering you only get three levels.

One minor issue may be the audio levels. The volume in this game starts off pretty high and only gets higher when you start to build up a combo. The graphics and gameplay are amazing. This game is actually so beautifully crafted that after beating all three levels I was sad and wanted more. There is an impeccable amount of replayability in this game. The ""To-Poo Lists"" add a nice challenge and give you a sense of acomplishment once you complete them. To sum it up, buy this game. You will not regret it.

,Not Recommended,449540,23991600,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,racism is correct,"Okay, let's get real here: A lot of people say ""oh, poop? Haha yeah sure I like it as much as the next person, nothing weird about me or anything ha ha, poop is 'dope' and 'rad'"" or whatever, just so they can sound ""cool"" and fit in and whatnot. I can't blame them for being poop poseurs but I can't respect them for it either.I'm not like that. I really do love poop, and pooping, and basically anything involving poop and pooping. I don't just love poop - I♥♥♥♥♥♥poop, and yes, I deliberately did a cuss there just so everyone reading this review will know that I truly heart heart heart heart poop. I name my poops. I talk to my poops. I clap when I poop. Hell, sometimes I even do the wave. I reminisce about my poops. I'm not afraid to admit it - if I could marry poop I almost certainly would, but my heart would be torn between wanting to marry poop and wanting to marry the process of taking a poop, which I love every bit as much as I do the actual poops it results in. Girls are nice, but poop is far better, and when I proclaim that ""b­itches ain't sh­it"", I mean it - and I mean it in a very, very different way than Eminem (or, as he was known at that time, ""Vanilla Ice"") did when he coined that phrase.So if a game has ""poop"" in the title, involves pooping, and even lets you choose where to poop, it really, really has a long way to go before I'll give it a thumbs-down.And yet here we are.The trailer is deceptive - each of the game's stages is a static screen, with no ability to pan or rotate in any direction. Since the ""object"" of the game is to barf poop at specific targets, which can be anywhere along the game's z-plane, this can be remarkably frustrating - imagine trying to line up a headshot when you're forced into a top-down perspective.While the trailer makes the game look like a ""chaos simulator sandbox"", sort of vaguely along the lines of Goat Simulator or, for those of you who have heard of it, Demolition Inc, there's barely any actual chaos to be found here - people run around aimlessly once you hit them with poop, but you're not going to get to poop on a waiter who then runs into a bicyclist who swerves into a car which plows into a tree and blah blah blah. ""Combos"" just mean hitting targets with poop and not missing in-between (and with the game's crummy camera angle, missing is a lot easier than it sounds).All you get are three stages, each with its own ""special weapon"": New York is a giant ball of poop that explodes into hundreds of little turds, Beijing is pretty much the same thing except it's a firework so it explodes in mid-air, and Paris allows you to shoot a constant stream of turds, sort of like a flamethrower of diarrhea. You play a stage repeatedly, unlocking the same things in each one (higher poop capacity, highest poop capacity, double targets, quadruple targets, special weapon). If you can hit two things in a row, you get dubstep. If you miss a shot, the dubstep goes away. Once it's over, you get your score and can restart. There's no leaderboards and all of the targets feel the same - they either move across the screen or they're a trash can or something that stays in place, and if they move across the screen, they'll start running around if you barf a turd on them and eventually fall down.The music (all two songs worth) is great and this game could actually be somewhat fun if there was a bit more variety in the experience, and if the camera could be moved around to better line up shots. Instead, the devs took the low road, making a handful of ~Youtube Celebrities~ (i.e. texture swaps of the player character) in the hopes Total Biscuit or the like will give them a shout-out, then quickly moving on to - pardon me - fart out a sequel, which grafts on a bad rhythm game framework but uses the same basic ""as­s""ets.""Bottom"" line: You're paying money - sure, not a *lot* of money, but money nonetheless - for something that's indistinguishable from hundreds if not thousands of games on Newgrounds.A proud fecal maniac like myself giving this game a thumbs-down is like some dude in a Cloud Strife costume giving a Final Fantasy VII port a thumbs-down, except instead of crying because Aeris died, I'm just a bit miffed that I never got to see her bowels evacuate post-mortem."

I played 41 minutes and have completed it, achievements and all.You are tasked with pooping on everything you can below you, with a to-do list, aptly named the ""to-poo"" list, of targets to achieve. That's it. You start with 5 poops and as you complete tasks on your ""to-poo"" list, you unlock more poops, more targets, and a special ability to help rain stinky devastation upon your unsuspecting, long necked, targets.That's it. That's the game.For anyone who cares, the achievements are easy, the game is easy, and for the low low price of (at time of writing) 79p, it's a nice little time waster.I wouldn't say it's addictive, or that I will go back to play it again (the game offers you the option to reset your saved data so you can complete your ""to-poo"" list over and over), but I enjoyed my 41 minutes with it, and can happily recommend whoever is reading this buy a copy for themselves."

You're looking at probably about an hour of entertainment (if you want to complete everything) for $1.  The To-Poo List was fun to try to figure out.   The high score achievements were not daunting because they are cumulative.   Although there are only three levels, I enjoyed the variety they provided.  One thing I would have liked is if the thumping fun combo music had the local flavor.  Regardless, it is definitely an incentive not to miss a combo so you don't lose the music.  There isn't much in the workshop right now except for an amazing Donald Dump character with the slogan ""Make pooping great again.""  That is definitely worth checking out.  I'd recommend this if you're looking for something unique with a bit of a challenge, but that you can also 100% pretty easily in a single sitting."

You have to manage your money, and make sure that, when you get out a loan from the bank, you have enough money to pay it back, or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you, and they will complete jobs for you, but you have to pay them a wage, plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills, that make them be better at certian things, like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance, or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials, so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.You can always do 'Quick Jobs', and these are when the employer provides the truck, and you just go where they tell you. This is fun, but it starts to get boring, only doing short deliverys, so you can buy a truck, so that you can go further distances, and get more money.To conclude, I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator, or any simulator game should give this game a try, because it is a great way to unwind after a long day, and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game, I happen to disagree."

My first playthrough I was a little confused on what needed to be done since the game starts you out with only 1 level that you can play. The other 2 are locked until you get the powerup to unlock the next level. I played through it and enjoyed it at first. Then I closed the game and came back a few hours later to see everything was deleted. Then I read the text at the bottom that says kinda ""Logging out will reset the game"" somewhat in that context. So ok... that's not a bad thing, Then I went to select a character and I had to go outside of the game to subscribe to one. They have no effect on the game besides cosmetic (unless I missed something). I understand this game is meant to be a joke, but I like joke games that are fun playthrough after playthrough. This one had no strategy, no save functionality and no character stats page. I enjoyed it the first playthough, but there isn't enough content to justify even buying this game.3/10 graphics2/10 audio"

Play that title instead for your scatophilic casual shooting game needs.Angle-based timing shooter where you catapult poo on bypassers for highscore. Aiming is done with a pillar of light with a center point. Camera is not vertical or horizontal and stands at this improvised isometric perspective that shifts from level to level. On some levels bypassers get too close to the camera to be able to aim at them as you cannot see the floor for aiming. You can unlock special abilities which helps to do higher score by completing in-game achievements. Unlocks are limited, levels are repetitive. Making combos make music get louder and camera shake for a trippier feel. Would be amusing if rest of mechanics allowed to consistently get good and achieve that but thats not the case here."

As other people have said, getting achievements is very easy but that doesn't bother me as they extend the lifespan of the game, if only by a little bit.What I like most is the music that starts building in both volume and complexity when you begin getting your combo meter going, but abruptly stops if you screw up. It makes you want to keep your combo going and is a brilliant (if simple) use of sound design.Half an hour of immature humour for 99 cents is what you're getting.If you enjoyed Goat Simulator, or PAIN on PS3, you'll probably like this as the general idea is the same - cause havoc at different locales, get your combo meter up, indulge your inner ten-year-old.8/10 would poop on long-necked weirdos again."

There is three stages including the starting one and to progress through them you have to complete all the objectives in the right hand corner. The objectives can range from getting a high score to crapping in a certain thing. All the stages have a basic crap and one that is unique to that stage. There is a bomb crap, a firework crap, and diarrhea. The game is fun for a little bit but gets repititive within 10-15 minutes. The hit detection could also be improved as there was a lot of times where shots that should have hit the targets missed. For a free game though, it's decent and I recommend giving it a try"

I got at least an hour worth of flinging poo at people and collected ALL the achievments on the To-Poo List. I'd say it's fairly priced for a silly time killer. It has a some small bugs here and there but for less than a $1 ... I'm willing to over look it. Got a lot of laughs out of it too, which if I hadn't I may not have enjoyed it as much.

Or fire our rear thrusters and clip a trouser yam onto the streets of a big city? I know I have.  Now that dream is realized.Creating intestinal street sculpture has never been so fulfilling.  At the end of a long work day, releasing chocolate hostages is truly a joy.  I could murder a mud bunny right now just thinking about it.There are no log jams here, just the simple pleasure or dropping a lawn sausage into someone's food, onto their head, into a baby carriage, and so on.   It's true that repeated bombardments might leave you a little sore, and it can get a wee bit repetitive, but this game has more ""poo"" than Hundred Acre Wood... and I'll get behind that any day.

No, for real.The aim of the game is to complete your 'to poo list' and achieve combos and high scores via pooping on people. These tasks are really easy to do and some require trick shots that insist on bouncing the poop at an angle to get it in the bin - Jesus Christ why am I reviewing this... I could be doing something better with my life but nope, I spent $0.89 on a game about pooping on people and play through it and unlock all the damn achievements for it...I really need to re-evaluate my life...There are 3 stages, city based levels which include New York, Beijing, and Paris. You must navigate your protaganists aim and poop at your targets in order to achieve objectives on your list, completing these in a variety of ways and earning combos. There's really not much to it, but its simplicity is fine.I'd recommend this game to fans of the indie genre, it's a neat little title (even if that title is a bit cr@p...) at a miniscule price and offers around 20-30 minutes of game time, complete with very easy to obtain achievements. I'd recommend playing this game with a friend or if you're a gaming YouTuber who wants some humours content, definitely a title to grab for it's hilarity.Verdict: 5/10 for being a very simple indie game that doesn't really offer a huge amount of content but scores extra points based on a completely different and weirdly unique idea, as well as it's dirty potty humour. So if you've got the time and money, dive right into this sh!tstorm :)"

You stand on top of buildings and drop poop on unsuspecting passersby. That might sound like it could get dull, and the game does have a lifespan, but there's a surprising amount to be discovered. There is a huge amount of different trick shots and animations to discover. Certain characters react to the poop differently and you can bounce the poop off of awnings. If you poop on a certain number of people, you unlock little perks, such as more people walking around, or alternate poop weapons. As you only have a finite number of poops per session, you have to replay the level a few times to unlock things. The alternate poop weapons are pretty powerful and allow you to really begin upping your score, but they sacrifice accuracy, so specific outcomes might be harder to predict. Even though you unlock things through the number of people you poop on, the true goal is to get the highest score you can. The fact that you have to replay the levels to achieve the number of people pooped on does lengthen the game, but it does make the early stages a bit slow, and the game truly hits its stride when you've got the maximum people walking around. That said, it is important to start slowly so you can learn each area, so it's not too bad of a progression.The game's biggest asset is its charm. The graphical style is cute and hilarious. I love the weird, springy-haired guy who drops the poop, and the random citizens are equally memorable. I love the sound it makes when you poop. The visual style on the menus is clean and slick looking. The ragdoll physics add to the chaos in so many ways that even the developer might not have foreseen. One time I pooped on a guy and he ran out into the street and got hit by a car, only to have his body flung over the buildings. There were several moments where I had genuine, gut laughter from either the physics, the animations, or some secret thing that the game snuck into a level. It's crude stuff, but the game never feels mean-spirited and it lets you in on the joke. On that level, I definitely reccomend this game for its entertainment value.The game's biggest failings are in its technical merits. The framerate is choppy and the game feels a bit unoptimized. My PC can max out most games at 60fps, so I should have no problem running a game like this. It does seem to smooth out after playing for a few rounds, but there's no reason for a game like this to lag. The other big issue is that there is not controller support. You have to aim with WASD and this feels a bit too clunky and imprecise to always get the exact shot I'm going for. Most of the time it's not too much of an issue, but it does hold the game back a bit. In a game like this where movement is part of the challenge, it would probably be too easy if you could aim with the mouse, but I think analogue stick movement would be the perfect middleground. I also think the camera on the New York level might benefit from being pulled out a bit, as when you try to aim into the extreme foreground, you can't see where you're actually aiming. The China level does rectify this however.There's Poop in My Soupisn't perfect, but for 89 cents it is a funny and charming way to kill a few minutes. The game's biggest issues seem like they could easily be solved with a patch or two, and I hope the developer will keep working on this. It has issues, but I like it."

I'm almost 21 for pete's sake, so if I can laugh at it, then that shows how satly the lot of you are. I'm sure it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. If it got a greenlight, then it must mean it's worth a play. Yeah I'd say otherwise if it was $5-10 or even more for this game.But either way. Very good/funny game for the price.
