The game has humor and is somewhat challenging. Plus the remaster edition (christmas DLC) has nice music. It's perfect as an intro to the Shoot 'Em up genre.

,Recommended,449550,25408342,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,Lumina,"Despite what my game time on it on steam would say I have spent hundreds of hours throughout the years playing the non remastered version.Even though it is a simple game it is very fun snd able to get you hooked and determined to beat it, after all, who wants to get beaten by chickens?They changed the music from the non remastered one which is a shame as I thought it was better but it takes nothing away from the game,You are able to play co-op on it via the same computer so can also also be a good way for you and a friend/family member to have fun gaming together as not many games let you co-op via the same computer, a definite good buy; even if you are just wanting to pass some time, the price for the fun you can get from it makes it good value."

And you can mute it too! 7/10Playability: Works fine with pad as well as keyboard, no gfx lags no sound lags, all good. Even when screen is full of chicken n eggs. 10/10Good pricing (4€) 12/10Overall 9/10.5 point deduction for me now having the strange urge to buy chicken wings..."
,Recommended,449550,22635416,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,FlourMaker99,The nostalgia trip is real with this game - makes me feel like the 7 year old that I once was. Also a great fill-in for when you're out of ideas for gaming. A classic that will stand the test of time.

76561198068088731,Not Recommended,449550,32852061,Posted: 27 June,all,Quake_Enhanced,"♥♥♥♥ this game. It is very unforgiving when you play at veteran. I reached Mars (very hard might I add), and when I start the level again and again, It only leaves me with only two upgrades, and I need 7 to 8 shots each to kill a single freaking chicken. Oh, and did I say it's very easy to die? Yes it is. This is the most unforgiving game I have, too bad I wasted two euros on this, might as well still pirate it for all I care. The other games, however, are far superior and managed to beat them even on Veteran because they are B.A.L.A.N.C.E.D.Get this only to say:""Hey, I own Chicken Invaders 2!"""
,Not Recommended,449550,31352424,Posted: 25 April,all,CSMES,"- Too little content... 30 min each playthrough(progress can be saved)- Too simple...-  Liked it a bit, though.Bought it since I have played it somewhere else.* Well, might recommendable for people who are new to these kind of games.Could actually be challenging for them.But if anything, just go for the latest versions firsrt.There's practically no stories to follow.**Nah, screw my last review, just go for the latest versions first.They're better in everything for everyone.- 110 waves of invader-styled chickens shooting.- Few types of weapons, and enemies patterns.- The only really hard stage is the final, otherwise are not even so worth a challenge,(Well, you could challenge yourself like collect all items or no power ups but meh...)- I hear no in-game musics. I even checked the option (that is uncheck mute).- Control is hard and kind of funny (well, the game is old).- One of the games where manual firing is much faster that autofiring.- By the way, you cannot get to the bottom most of the screen.You'll totally see what you missed floating slowly right on your back.* The sequel has much more content. (More graphics too, of course.)Also played that one. Considering to buy it on Steam with discount.The gameplay is no so different, but it gives you more to do."

,Recommended,449550,32806954,Posted: 26 June,all,Hamburg,"Was inlove with the game as a kid, I spent hours upon hours, without knowing it was the Demo version. Nostalgic. Though, after playing TBOI and Gungeon and other bullet hell games, took me one run to finish the game. Thought it would have a bit more variety in the weapon upgrades but seems like getting to max weapon isnt hard. Btw, if anyone has problems with quick flashes and lights, do not use the Laser weapon(The Yellow One)."
,Recommended,449550,29100831,Posted: 7 January,all,LoneLion,"A really entertaining game which brings a lot of memories from my childhood, still remember playing it for the first time in my neighbor's old PC. So I thought I would buy it here on Steam for some nostalgia, since it's so cheap. No idea why they would change the magnificent original music sounds from the game, but it's still nice that they decided to leave the original, as they call it, ""chiptune"" music, since it is much better, and sounds less generic than the ""orchestral"" one, IMHO.If you just wanna kill some time, this is the perfect game for you, it is fairly easy to beat once you get the hang of it, but it's really lots of fun."
