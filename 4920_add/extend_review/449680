In this game you will fight Adolf Gutler,The Illuminati, and other creatures.Release Date: 25 Mar, 2016The GameplayThe games difficulty lies in the fact that movement is relatively sensitive, and touching an enemy will cause death. There are no lives in the game so it is an instant restart upon death. The bullets shoot out of the front of the plane in the center, so you cannot just sit on one side and shoot, because you risk getting your plane clipped.The bosses in the game are relatively easy. Shooting the boss 10 times will cause it to recede and fall back. It is not as gratifying as seeing a big explosion, but it works the best with the 8 bit graphics due to the constant gameplay.The graphics are styled in an 8-bit fashion. It is all very blocky, and simplistic. The colors palate is limited with most levels using three colors in general.All in AllSAMOLIOTIKis a really nice Casual Game!8/10 From MeSweep"

The controls are okay, there is no variation in enemies or even bosses as all normal enemies just come vertically down the screen, nothing fires at you. The bosses are a bit different in the stay on screen until destroy and wobble about trying to back you into a corner with the normal enemies that keep coming during the boss fights. Each stage will have a new shaped enemy and boss but the all behave the same way throughout the game, so there is little variation.There are a few different bonuses to pick up - allowing you to fly faster, shooter faster or triple shot, etc., but apart from that there is no real depth here, and nothing really to recommend it unless you are easily amused by the memes/randomness thrown at you."

I would love to see more shmups where you can move as fast as your mouse does. The last two levels are *so good* if you're in the flow.That said, the first three levels are slower (read: worse), the game is mega repetitive, sometimes levels are unbeatable because some counters seem to glitch up, and the game force closes after the fourth level, so the authors put a ""get to the final level right away"" option in the main menu. Yeah…IF the game didn't glitch up this badly, I'd recommend it without a second thought (although it's still a very specific type of a short game). But it does! On the other hand, if you want a lovely, really short dash of mouse-shmupping nonsense, this mightn't bother you."

Random power-up items drop and they do different things. For example, one can make you shoot three bullets at a time instead of 1, or another power up can speed you up.The bosses are pretty easy to defeat, since you dont really need to ""kill it"", you just shoot it a few times and it will fly away (at least what I've seen so far).The controls are easy, you just move your mouse to move your plane and mouse1 to shoot.Comments:I like this game because its pretty relaxing (unless you rage a lot for small things ex. Dying).There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing I couldn't handle. An example of a bug is after I die, I can still move the plane around (though I can't see it) and shoot (I could hear the shooting sound).Since I got this game for sale due to getting a coupon from crafting a badge, it was much worth the price that I pair for, which I think is about 30 cents or something.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys relaxing / easy games.The music is also quite nice as well.I used a macro that clicks infinitely so that I dont have to hold or click to shoot. This just allows me to worry about moving my mouse and not having to worry about clicking. (For anyone that wants an easier way to play an already easy game)"
,Recommended,449680,22822641,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,JacquesLeSauve,"SAMOLITOLOK... SIMILOTIKOK... SALITOLILOL... SUKALO... whatever the hell this thing is called, is a plane fly-y, shoot-y, weave-y, meme-y game that's out for you to play on your computer machine contraption right now. Use the mouse to control a silhouetted plane as it flies upwards, while trying your best to either shoot or avoid various other silhouetted shapes moving downwards. Hit a certain amount to reach a boss, shoot it, move on to a different ""stage""/background colour with different shapes coming at you, and don't crash into anything or you'll reset to the start. Do this over a small handful of stages, unlock all the achievements, have the game automatically shut down on you, move on with your life.It's a short game, clocking in at anything from 10 minutes to possibly half an hour, depending on your skill level or patience, the only other complications being some pick-ups that will have brief, temporary effects of either giving you a multi-shot, speeding you up, or sending out a row of projectiles to clear the screen. There have been a couple of updates to add two new stages and bosses to the game, bringing the total to 5 at the moment, but there may be more in future. It has a certain appeal to its super basic visual style, and the music is actually pretty good. But for better or worse, that's all there is to the game. I think the more interesting discussion here may be about products and their value or worth.I may have only gotten 20 minute's worth of play out of this with its current content (the rest of my play time being for card drops) but for only 99 cents, I'm not actually going to complain about that. Some people feel hard done by the game because of this and feel it should be free, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Trying to view this from a creative perspective, had I spent any decent amount of time and effort putting something together with sincere intentions of entertaining people, then I wouldn't feel the price was too unreasonable. Sure, what it's worth to you, only you can say - maybe you'll love the game, maybe you won't - but I think it's fair. I mean, if you can afford a device to play this on, the electricity to power it, the bill for your internet access to download it, and however many other things that might come into play, are you really going to complain about something as trivial as 99 cents and say you were ripped off because you only got half an hour's worth of content that someone else put some work into? I'm sure we've all wasted more money on worse things than this and barely thought twice about it. Like I said, value is pretty subjective and the worth of anything will vary from person to person, but I still think this is justified in this case.So, while I'm not exactly in love with the game or anything, I was still entertained and enjoyed my time with it and hope there will be more updates to come. Get it on sale, at full price, or not at all, it's your choice, and either way you're not wrong in which you prefer, but if you do get it at least don't make the same mistake I did and do yourself a favour - don't play this in the dark sitting really close to the screen. I don't think my eyes will ever be the same again."

After you make it, Vladimir can see your talent and says: ""Igor, you need destroy evil evil very evil capitalism of the usa."" So you start destroying the economy of the us without knowing what's coming...Then you face the base of evil capitalism. Illuminati himself comes to fight you. If you find vodka you might get enough force to actually survive his capitalism. After that, you realize Mr Putin had a power trip and he is now trying to invade the whole world since the us of a isn't an ennemy anymore. So he sends you on a mission to kill the evil egyptian beetles until you get to the master of egypt. The cat thing. (sphinx?) The cat thing is the most intense boss in the game because in 2029 the capitalists egyptians have control of most of the world. So the cat thing shall die. If you manage to do it, you will quickly realize that the world has gone to chaos. Putin, by sending you, Igor the elite soldier, actually destroyed the world, even the good ones.This game is a good way to actually reflect on life itself.
