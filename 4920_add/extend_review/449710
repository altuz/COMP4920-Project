This is a fun, well-made game where the core mechanic is to precisely control your little soldiers to maximize efficiency. There are many goals to balance: accuracy, power, ammunition, equipment repair, soldier health, and targetting.It doesn't make sense to criticize this game for requiring the user to use the mouse too quickly because YOU CAN PAUSE THE GAME. Pausing is important because there will be hard decisions to make and you have limited time.It also doesn't make sense to criticize the game for ""Nazi undertones"". I like the post-apocalyptic, Orwellian theme."

All this piece of garbage actually does is make me appreciate the FTL team even more, because these guys don't seem to have any idea what they're doing.This game is not permadeath (in fact, you have to go out of your way to restart the game), but it penalizes failure by denying you medals which make the game easier. So... you'll need to restart a bunch.You can't see the enemy fortress before you start a level, so the only way to design your fortress to deal with the enemy is... to fail, which penalizes you.Until recently, the game awarded you money for victory (more money if you beat your enemy by boarding their fortress). You use this money to unlock/upgrade room types, and then pay again to add multiple rooms. You probably see the pattern already: Yes, of course you have no way of knowing if you've researched or purchased 'the wrong stuff'. Too bad. There's no sell button, so if you've made enough mistakes, you have to restart. The game's since added an 'Easy' mode which does away with money. This certainly helps. Curiously, they didn't add a 'sell' button like most people asked for. In fact, they've made very few changes to the main game at all, implying they think this stupid design is perfectly okay.So... what's the big deal with restarting? There are 100 levels. Most people seem to need to restart by level 30 or so.Redcon is frustration-based gameplay. It starts off fun, then quickly develops dysfunctions that anyone can see. They're so glaring and obvious that I can only conclude the developers simply didn't (and continue not to) care. Do yourself a favor and stay away."
,Recommended,449710,22598761,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,CommissarBRO,"Take the core concepts of FTL (room management, single item selection and movement, upgrades and customization) and apply it to a post-apocalyptic world who's warfare tech has stagnated to forts and artillery (and the occasional laser...). The game is pretty fun and quickly becomes frantic in the later portions of the game. At first I was disappointed because I thought the game didn't have any customization (the first 3-4 missions doesn't allow you to customize your fort) but once I realized that you actually can, the game became much more fun.The actual gameplay itself is simple. You target the enemy fort using your own guns and try to blow it up. Forts have ""rooms"" or emplacements that can be target to disable guns or utilities like med bay etc etc. You have Operators who repair the rooms and man the rooms which provide passive bonuses to the item they are manning. Operators are limited so try not to let them die. You win when you bring down your enemy's health bar to zero. Later stages of the game gets particularly difficult. Guns have different special abilities like stun or shred etc etc. And you can get some serious firepower in the later stages as well. Still a really hard game.In summation, it takes the things that made FTL fun and applies it to artillery and forts. Works really well and for 5.99, it's not a bad price. Definitely recommend this one.Gameplay Footage:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D-59L5v4Ro"

The bigger your base grows the more micromanagement is required. But thats no problem since you can pause the game at any time to issue orders.

,Recommended,449710,22622101,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,Xisi,"Very fun game with plenty of strategic depth.1. Equipment selection. (There is a limited number of equipment slots available.) Do you go for maximum offense or countermeasures to prevent them from striking you? Heavy hitting artilery that's slow or rapid fire rounds? You'll also have to contend with munitions and power.2. Equipment placement. Decide which equipment to protect since equipment in the back ranks are very difficult to hit (accuracy is a big factor).3. Decide which stations to man (You have limited number of soldiers). Stations that are maned have special bonuses, such as reduced reload time, or improved accuracy.4. Actively move soldiers to stations where they are needed (ie. put out fires, repair damaged stations, or to recover health in a medical bay.5. Decide which high-value target to take down. Do you focus fire? Or simultaneously strike multiple targets?6. Micro managing each weapon's fire is available should the need arise. Since countermeasures have a cooldown, it is possible to send out a coordinated strike.Based on game completion percentage of 21% for 5 hours, there's around 20-25 solid gameplay here. Highly recommended."
76561198006235277,Recommended,449710,23341308,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Fimbulvinter,"TL;DR: REDCON is a static artillery shooter that has shades of classic Worms, and FTL: Faster than Light thrown in. Combat is real time but with the ability to pause time to issue orders to soldiers and weapon batteries all at once. Core gameplay mechanics are polished and strategy goes far deeper than simply trying to shell your opponent into submission. Worth checking out when on special.Long review:PROS:1; A wide assortment of weapons for you to choose from. Do you want rockets, siege mortars, standard artillery pieces, high end energy weapons? How about incendiary or poison shells? Somewhere you'll find a perfect complement of weapons to suit your playstyle.2; Deep tactical gameplay. You'll always have to check your threat list and retarget your weapons in order to get maximum effect. Should you go after the heavy siege weapons or the power reactors? Knock out their munitions factories to slow down their rate of fire, or just destroy the guns themselves?3; The art style is polished and well developed. Characters on the splash screens are well detailed, and watching as your in game soldiers do a celebration dance when they survive a mission is a joy to behold.CONS:1; No tutorial or significant tooltip help menus mean you can spend a significant amount of time flailing about in the early game not quite sure what to do with each of the resources you have to manage. No ability to sell old weapons means you have to be incredibly frugal about buying new weapons right from the start.2; The control scheme feels somewhat restrictive. There is no ability to bind weapons or soldiers to hotkeys for rapid access, nor is there any way to click and drag to select multiple guns. Each weapon has to be targeted individually and it can be easy to overlook one and leave it firing on an already destroyed room.3; No multiplayer. Easily this games biggest flaw is the lack of any kind or multiplayer, be it split screen, Local Area Network, or full internet matchmaking. The game is already set up into a two player split. Having a separate multiplayer mode where you get to progress your fort from a simple two room tower into a gigantic behemoth bristling with large caliber guns and tailored specifically to your whims would help extend this game's effective lifespan. As is stands, there is little to bring you back after you finish the storyline.REDCON takes multiple cues from other games in similar genres. Most notably, it takes combat cues from games such as FTL: Faster than Light. Your objective in each mission is to destroy or otherwise subjugate an enemy stronghold using the weapons mounted on your own stronghold. Aside from simply picking targets, you have to manage the internal workings of your own base in real time, assigning soldiers to repair damaged systems or to man the various guns or support utilities. Manning weapons gives you boosts such as bonus accuracy or fire rates, while utilities give bonuses such as extra power or improved reaction times on point defences. You'll never have enough soldiers to man everything, so you have to prioritise what you need in each moment.Tactical strategies will soon emerge in your play style. Fire one shell to distract that point defence drone only to follow up with a full volley from all your other guns. Or maybe you could launch a flashbang stun shell, only to rapidly follow it up with a neurotoxin shell and watch as the enemy quickly chokes and dies, leaving their fort ripe for the taking.The enemy A.I. tends to be a little precognisant at times, being able to know which rooms you are targeting and moving personnel out just in the nick of time, even when they don't have a functional radar system to warn them. It can get annoying when you just have one more soldier left to take care of, but you just can't nail him.Money is tight right off the bat. There currently is no means of salvaging or selling off old weapons once you have bought them. Those old, outdated light artillery pieces you started off with but are no longer using will just have to stay in storage forever while that fancy mark III sniper cannon mocks you with its long range bombardment abilities. If you spend foolishly in the early game, you will find the mid and late game periods harder than they have to be when you can't afford to buy upgrades or new weapon systems.Overall, REDCON is enjoyable and has enough content to keep you occupied for 10-15 hours or so as you progress through the core storyline. Once you are done with that though, there really isn't anything left to do as the lack of multiplayer or skirmish matchups limit replay value. REDCON is quite adequately priced for the content that you get. It plays well, the music is fitting to the situation, and nothing beats nailing that final shot on the enemy's foolishly exposed nuclear reactor. If you enjoyed FTL, you'll get some enjoyment out of this."

Two opposing towers covered in turrets shelling each other across the landscape whilst little men rush around manning and repairing things.  One must weigh up sacrifing available ammunution for more power and helpful utility rooms.  But there's a huge problem.Without prior knowledge of stages it's very easy to work oneself into a position where one doesn't have enough cash to then extricate oneself.  Turrets can't be sold and stages can't be replayed so expect to be frustrated as earlier decisions come back to bite you.If you don't google the solutions you'll need to restart the entire game often.Worse yet the game doesn't really progress.  You'll either find youself in the afore mentioned downword spiral of bankruptcy or discover that the enemy weapons and towers upgrade at the same pace as yours; I seldom felt that I was making headway.The men, what should have made REDCON an exciting and new experience, have no AI whatsoever.  They will cheerfully stand in flames, toxins or under falling shells.  They won't run to repair rooms near to them nor leave inactive turrets.Orders can be given whilst the game is paused but here-in lies the tedium.  I spent far more time paused than I did playing.  And I found myself going through the same motions again and again, stage after stage.  Pause, swap injured man for uninjured man.  Unpause.  Pause, click through all turrets to find out which is firing on what and re-assign targets.  Unpause.  Repeat.The graphics are pretty - what you see in the screenshots is what you get.  The music is a bit mediocre and there isn't enough of it cover the tens of hours of time you'd need to invest to complete this game.The story is forgettable and can be summend up as Fat Adolf Hitler vs Evil Kaiser Wilhelm.  The only piece that really engaged me was early on, I was ordered to attack a defenseless hospital tower and I decided I wasn't going to.  Unfortunately that wasn't a win condition.In short REDCON has an addicitve quality to it that is bad, it gives the feeling that there must be something more in the next tower or turret or layout and if you just tried that little bit harder you'd find it.  But there never is.  It's a one trick pony stretched far to thin."

76561198007216853,Not Recommended,449710,22708925,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,Scriboergosum,"This game has a lot going for it, like the artistic style, nice graphics, an Orwellian/1984 theme, great sound (I especially like the sounds the larger guns make) and the basic idea of two forts going at it with a variety of weapons and defenses is cool and not done to death.But in the end a game will stand or fall by its gameplay, and this is where REDCON fails. The game is a terrible grind that ends up being mostly about tedious micromanagement of getting men out of or into a room at just the right split second, manually telling 6-10 guns to fire, one at a time, after having told each of those very same guns which specific target to fire at... one at a time... Add to this an absurd amount of levels (at least 100) and an economic system that grants you a little money for completing each level, but doesn't let you replay levels or sell back guns or upgrades once bought, and you've got the perfect recipe for frustration.You'll reach a level where certain weapons are obviously better (there's a slight rock-paper-scissors mechanism to weapons vs. defenses), but you won't be able to use those weapons, since you haven't invested in them earlier and haven't the money to do so now. No matter which weapons you chose to focus on (small guns, large guns, missiles, lasers, ICBMs), you can't have them all and they will all be clearly better for some of the entirely too many stages. So to beat the levels your particular purchases aren't suited for, you'll just have to micromanage even more than usual.This is made worse by the defenses being annoyingly effective, so much so that even 15-20 projectiles of various size will get shot out of the air easily by 2-3 defensive lasers on your opponents fort, unless they all arrive within about a second of each other. That means telling the guns that have a faster reload to not fire while waiting for the slower guns, then when all are ready, you pause the game and tell them to fire one by one while paused and pray that enough get through to take down your target. If not, you can be sure that any damage done will be repaired by your enemy's soldiers before your next salvo is ready.And speaking of the soldiers, while the enemy soldiers will often jump out of a room at the very last second, right before a large shell hits that would have painted the walls with their innards, your own troopers do nothing unless you tell them to. There is no way to automate them beyond having them work at whatever station they find themselves at. They will automatically repair their station if it is damaged, but even that is not necessarily an advantage, as you'd sometimes prefer the gravely wounded trooper to just get healed by the Aid Station room rather than spend the next minute repairing it while a gust of wind could end his life.The already excessive grind of the game is in this way an many others made worse by the mechanics. You can't easily control guns and soldiers, so you have to compensate by micromanaging so much you feel like you're doing your taxes rather than playing a game. In the end, while wanting to like this game so much, it just wasn't enjoyable to me for more than a minute or two before it turned a chore again. It's like a gocart where the engine stops every 30 seconds. It promises fun, but you end up fighting what was supposed to be the source of your entertainment."

You start out a level by selecting a variety of Fort layouts, drop in the weapons and equipment you have purchased previously into the varied slots (rooms) within the layout, and then go toe to toe with the next enemy Fort in a long campaign of such levels. This is achieved through inspired layouts, the smart use of crewing rooms (that increase their effectiveness), and choosing to obliterate enemy rooms and troops in an order chosen by you, before they do the same to you.As you progress you can spend your hard earned money on purchasing new weapon technologies as they unlock through the game, or even upgrade your existing weaponry/equipment as this comes available, making your new layouts even more powerful than those use before. But this is where this games single biggest issue begins. Money...Although you are encouraged to customise your layout, and by extension try new things as they unlock, if you do so, and aren't fortunate enough to use your money on the right weapon/equipment at the right time, try and experiement with builds, or vary your strategy from time to time, you will eventually find yourself up against a fort that you cannot defeat, not matter how many times you try. This is because you ran out of money... with no way to ever make more.Your only option left to you? Hard reboot and start from the very beginning again, regardless of how far you got before. Yes, you could be one of the lucky ones whose personal strategy happened to be one of the few that gets you through to the end, but more likely one of the ones who has to start from the very beginning a time or two until you realise you are severely punished if you attempt to go down various paths.It is an issue that has a simple fix, one of many suggested by the community, but has yet to occur or be acknowledged. If any were to be adopted, I would change my recommedation in an instant."

If you believe in the 1 buck should equal 1 hour of play time for a game to be worth it, this game is VERY worth it.You're basically a Nazi commander in a dystopian future and it is your job to eradicate the very last country that stands in the way of a Nazi dominated world. You get to command fortresses with huge ridiculous guns, cannons and lazers. Pound the enemy till they drop by using a healthy arsenal of various weapons. Rearrange them in different ways to get different setups that may or may not be able to beat your enemy.Only con is that your enemy unlocks new stuff faster than you do. But then again, maybe that is deliberate so that you get to figure out a weapon's weakness before you can use it yourself."

You need to carefully choose where to focus your assault to win the long game.A lot of rounds will quickly turn into a war of attrition, with units repairing and healing themselves, so its critical you pick and choose your targets carefully.The combat is similar to FTL (Faster Than Light) in that you target specific rooms, and wait for your weapons to charge. There is also the ability to pause the game to plan these attacks, just like FTL.The graphics are very nice to look at, and I like the clever differences in the opposing sides that give a reference to how large the battle field really is.In summary, if you like Worms, Tank Wars, or FTL, you will no doubt love this game.

The game design is really original and well thought, which is probably why I spent so much time on it. The problem is that you get nowhere near enough credits to buy the stuff you need to win further levels. At some point you will get stuck at a level which is obviously made to win using item X or Y which you do not have, you cannot purchase it because you are broke, and the only way to earn money is by winning games. Knowing that, I had to start the campaign from scratch and remember ahead the kind of items I would need to go forward. Would have been cool to be able to replay previous missions to earn more credits, for example. Nuclear strikes don't help at all, you may go one level further but do not earn credits.Playing so long to get stuck at half-campaign and needing to restart from scratch to buy the stuff needed to see the end of the game?

Absolutely.Similar to FTL's combat, you customize your fortress and target the rooms in the enemy fort. The story is fairly simple but near the end I did find myself surprisingly engaged. Its pretty fun once you iron out a general strategy. However, the difficulty curve getting there can be very frustrating. But once you get it down, its possible to keep the same fortress layout for multiple missions upgrading your rooms where necessary. Honestly I found myself quite addicted to the gameplay very early in.Personally I've never been wanting for more credits to buy things, but I suppose if your trying to experiment with different weapons and layouts its something to keep in mind - you can't sell it back. Though once you get farther into the game you should already been familiar with enemy weapons to understand what they are about.A big problem with the game would be how it controls. You'll need to check the guide to find out about the non-remappable keybinds. Clicking on the troops in your fort can get very annoying especially when you have a bunch crammed together. You also can't preset troop locations or default weapon modes before the start of battle. So at the beginning of every mission you may find yourself pausing to re-allocate each trooper and setting multiple weapons. There's also no way to define a weapon group, so if you have say a bunch of mortars you like to aim a particular target you'll need to set each weapon individually. It can get very annoying if you need to sweep through the enemy fort. Expect to micro-mange a lot - lots of pausing. The enemy AI can be tricky at times in regards to how it moves its troops around - sometimes they seem clairvoyant when you target your weapons at them, in spite of destroying the Early Warning Radar. Still there's a strategy for that too.Apart of the challenge is that fact that you go into each mission blind. You can't see the enemy fort layout beforehand. But with the right set of skills you can still prevail. My advice would be not to fret over the mission streak and highscore. You can focus on those once you iron out your strategy. Especially in regards to those challenge missions. Basically your given a prebuilt fort and you have to destroy the enemy fort. These are more like puzzles that require a particular strategy to succeed, expect to retry a couple of times.All in all I'd say its worth a purchase if your looking for a fun base command game in the vein of FTL.TLDR, GIT GUD YOU FILTHY CAUSAL"

Have to say: this game is not for everyone. I'm on a winning-streak of 10 and counting on my first play, while others whine how it was too hard. I am missing freeplay and multiplayer. Otherwise it's a neat little game. It is not too easy and that's a good thing! You have to take a close look at the enemy and need to find weaknesses in their defense and think how to crack them best, it's by no means brainless point and click. Simple minded people might miss the myriad of strategic possibilities this game brings.It also has a puzzle-like feel to it sometimes as different enemy castles call for different specifications of your own stronghold.It is not for:-people who want or need a lot of handholding (first few missions are tutorial-style afterwards you're on your own)-people who want an easy game a 6-year-old could enjoy (seems to be the case with quite a lot of people)-people who look for a shooter-game that doesn't require a lot of thoughtIt is for:-people who like strategy games in general and would look to add another casual titel with enough depth and funny little animations to their collection-people who like a challenge-people who don't play long sessions but want a fun game for the coffee-break at workPeople who liked FTL will like this too. The gameplay with lots of pause for strategic arrangements is similar. For this price it's ok although makes a bit small impression as there is only campaign-mode. If you don't own FTL yet i'd recommend to spend the money on that one first though, this one has better graphics while FTL had a little more depth and content, but it's not really a clone.The broadest content in this is weapons, rooms, layouts for your stronghold. It comes short in game-modes and musical variety.All-in-all it's not the worst game i ever bought. I expect to get 10 to 20 hours of decent gameplay out of it at least, so it's a casual titel.On sale, below 5 bucks price it's definately a 'buy'. For this 6-bucks-price it's an 'okay' in my book.edit: after being a few more missions in it gets really hard, but that's ok. I see this as one of those titles you repeat coming back to for an occasional 20 minutes play. So it's a 'casual game done right'.So in conclusion: if you are specifically looking for a casual 'cofffee-break-game' this is a good buy because it does serve that type of player really well imo. After your initial 2 or 3 hours gameplay it's the ideal casual game.If you expect an ultra-adictive game for upwards of 200 hours gameplay and long sessions this isn't it. This is just a cute little game and actually better than most 'small games' out there.edit 2: more missions in; the game isn't really hard at all. Challenging, yes. Too hard, no."

In some sense its a tower defense game, where you have to keep your own fortress intact and mange your troops, but on that same aspect, it has elements of FTL in that your fortress carries over to other battles, and your choice for weapons and other upgrades sticks with you.While you may be expecting a casual game to waste the hours with, and you can easily jump in and out, the tactical depth and finding that winning combo to get past that one irritating level bring enough depth to keep even a toughened stratergist occupied.Currently I'm at about 38% complated for 9 hours of gameplay. Going by that I've got at least another 10-15 hours to go. So £5 for 25 hours of gameplay? You really can't complain at that.My only real complaint is that a campaign map would have been nice so you can pick and choose your battles and what equipment you can find and aquire. Other then that though there is very little wrong with this game, though a more indepth tutorial as to how certain weapons work would have been nice. As would be a sandbox mode which the dev's have said they're going to work towards adding.Overall, its a solid 4 out of 5 gamescore. The lost point is for the added mode and complexity that could add to the games lifespan an fun.Ignore the negative reviews. Most of them are complaining about this game being a mobile/flash port and for symbology they claim looks Nazi in origin... Both of which don't bear anything towards the gameplay."
,Recommended,449710,24235075,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,SCarterE,"An addictive and frustrating game.  There's a bunch of minor UI and control issues that can be rather frustrating.  For example, if you quit a mission before taking any damage, you can reconfigure your fort without breaking a win streak, but the game never tells you.  However, underneath the problems is a game that combines puzzle and RPG ideas in a compelling way.  You have to command a fort at several levels, starting with the basic load out of structures that determines your capabilities all the way down to commanding soldiers to abandon a burning room.  The FTL comparisons are apt, but where FTL demands decisive victory and makes attrition your worst enemy, Redcon wants you to embrace the grind.  Soldiers on both sides are surprisingly hard to kill and good at repairs.  Sometimes you'll find the weak point and blow up rooms faster than the enemy can keep up, but often you'll end up in patterns of attack and counterattack that seem like stalemates until someone's lifebar gives out.  Where the game most resembles FTL is its selection of weapons, except this game has more emphasis on fire, but the battles are a little more nuanced.  One example is the mortars, which have an entirely different trajectory than other guns.  As a result, they may have different accuracy ratings versus different targets, and sometimes they can bypass enemy defense turrets just because the turrets can't rotate fast enough to change targets when they're focused gunfire from the front.  Another example is the art of catching the enemy off guard.  A mortar loaded with shrapnel will annilhate a soldier it lands on, but they have a split second to dodge.  However, some quick shots from a less powerful gun might put the hurt on them before they can leave, and you might even be able to drop your shrapnel on the location that they escape to, if your coordination is tight enough.  This game's biggest barrier aside from its UI issues is the difficulty, but, like a lot of difficult games, the difficulty curve flattens out once you get towards the middle of the game because your options go up dramatically.  At any rate, for this price it's a better single player experience than any Worms game."

,Recommended,449710,22823889,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,cracatoa,"This is a pretty fun game with an interesting concept.  I've seen some reviewers suggest adding trenches or something else not ""mortar related"", and I think that's a bad idea.  That would take away from the uniqueness of this game, which is perhaps the best part of it.The worst part is a pretty glaring problem:  none of the guns are balanced very well.  You can beat the game with the very first gun by getting lots of them.  Shields are poorly executed, as they are a poor mix of how much damage and how many hits they can take.  The best strategy to get past them is to synch up a lot of smaller guns to fire at the same time.  Large guns are very powerful, and perhaps the best balanced weapons in the game.  Rockets, on the other hand, are nearly worthless.   Mortar Cannons are always powerful and especially useful for taking out enemy personnel, and lasers are great for penetrating shields, although the first iteration of these weapons is grossly underpowered and shoots far too slowly to have worth.The campaign is very long, and it does have a bit of a roguelike element to it.  Medals carry over from game to game, making it slightly easier, but not much.  As far as I can tell, there are only 6 medals which can all be acquired within 2 playthroughs very easily.Tutorial wise, there may as well be none.  While it explains extremely basic concepts, like how to fire and what a few weapons are good for, it does very little to explain actual game concepts like scoring, the fact that it is roguelike in regard to the medals, or that the perks and nothing else will carry over.The campaign is extremely long, so you're going to get your $6 out of it, if you enjoy the other aspects of it.I give this game a pretty solid 7/10."

I learned to pause at critical moments, but usually don't have to for most of a round.   You get different ammunitions and firing modes for most towers.  You can have some pretty cool designs for your fortress.  I lol'd @ ""fuhror"" and the pseudo Roman Empire stuff.Starts off a bit slow, and you get some disadvantages to the AI.  While the ideas are good, the story can use some work.  Weak starting towers with little variety to the tutorial, so the wonder wears off quick and leads into a grind mindframe.  LACK of a freeplay mode.  I'd say semi-casual game, because it takes a bit more strategy and planning than a laid back strategy game.Overall, it is a good experience, and I'm not dissapointed in the six bucks I spent."

This roguelike with no background or immersive feeling is very dull and uninteresting, you can only expect so much out of it. and I see no replay value because it does not retain anything except medals that you have gained from the previous campaign. FTL had loads of ships with different playstyles, this has only a few of those fortresses with identical structure everytime, thus nothing to hope for on the second run. So overall this is far from a good game, and please stay away unless you are an absolute fanatic about shelling people.Why you should stay away:For lovers of immersive backgrounds, there are barely anything in detail about it.For those who like games with lots of weapons, there are nothing really special, weapons are almost identical to what we have today, and the balancing is really off. Missiles are too slow and vulnerable, with low damage as well as slow reload speeds; lasers are only good at disrupting shield operations. Fast firing cannons are the most effective, with backup from larger cannons to take out key rooms. Basically, if you go for a combination of fast cannons, sniper cannons and have the right targeting order, there is no way you are going to lose, with other weapons you simply cannot do that.For upgrade game lovers, there are no choice of upgrade routes, there is only one route you can follow, and that is only an increase in stats, meaning no unique abilities at the top tier."

Dodging most of my attacks (troops and even buildings (cmon its a damn building how are you missing 70% of the time).It gets old fast and one battle can last over 20-30+ minutes of doing nothing but trying to kill the enemies soldiers who dodge every incoming shell. It gets old and you can go from having knocked out almost all of the enemy's guns to the AI having repaired them all 30 seconds later because you used Anti-personnel rounds which the enemy dodges anyway.
