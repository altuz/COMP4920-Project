Which is always good in a puzzle game."

At one point I re-enacted the old movie trope of taking my glasses off and biting the temple piece although I could probably write a thesis on lucid dreaming now. I deserve candy after beating this.
76561197971417681,Recommended,449730,32987099,Posted: 29 June,all,Anacro,"This is a great game if you like to search wikipedia and other websites whilst learning things.  It's basically an ARG and typically works like like this...You're given some pictures and text and audio, from there you have to work out the answer from the clues, the letters to the answer are shown in a circle of sorts.  Those given letters are not enough to work out the answer as there are lots of combinations, you have to search websites. There are other types of clues as well.Typically you'll be searching wikipedia, but also searching websites that have been made specifically for the game, you'll be logging into fake websites digging deeper for information and emailing fake people which in turn gets you more info you might be looking for.The puzzle difficulty varies, sometimes you'll find the answer quite quickly, other times it may take you a while, but you'll be learning stuff you never knew about.If it all becomes to frustrating, then there are 5 hints per day you can use, I usually find the first couple of hints don't help that much, but once you get to the 3rd hint things may seem a bit clearer, by the time you've used the 5th hint you should be on the right track but no gaurantee. There's also the Alice and Smith forum where you can get more nudges if need be, however they tend not to give the answers which is good, just a friendly nudge.I'm about half way through the game and have to say I'm really enjoying it, frustrates me at times but when you do finally get the answer it's great.I breifly played their other game the Blackwatchmen, which I had fun with and one I'll go back to after this sometime, it's just Ahnayro has that handy hint system which has been invaluable."
76561198110483386,Recommended,449730,30815773,Posted: 29 March,all,TarjaS,"This is the first time I'm playing a game like this and it's really fun. It's not easy - I have needed hints and quite a bit of help from the forums - but I have managed to solve the first two tables. Usually I would leave something this difficult unfinished, but this game is much too interesting for that, so I'll keep going. Fortunately, the limited number of hints is reset every day, so you just need to wait until the next day to continue, if you get totally stuck. And even without using hints, taking a break and letting your subconscious work on the puzzles is probably a good idea. This game is not for everyone, but if you like hard puzzles and searching for obscure information in the web, you'll probably like it."
,Not Recommended,449730,32554488,Posted: 18 June,all,Pogo,"Homework Simulator(TLDR Version:1. It's not their fault I'm not big on ARGs, but I wouldn't have bought it if that had been clearer. Billing this as a puzzle game feels disingenuous.2. The clues are so vague that you are often forced to spend limited hints or ask other players for answers.3. Gorgeous sights and sounds.End of TLDR)NOTE: I havenotplayed The Black Watchmen. My understanding is that the games are connected, but nothing suggested that there was any sort of prerequisite.I was already aware of Black Watchmen when this game showed up in my recommendations, and I knew that Black Watchmen is an ARG that encourages collaboration with other players. I knew that wasn't the kind of game I would enjoy, so I was relieved to see that Ahnayro is tagged as a single-player puzzle game.Except it's actually an ARG that encourages collaboration with other players. So there's that.I played through the first few nodes, wondering when the puzzles were going to be introduced, and I eventually realized that the word ""puzzle"" was being used to refer to the content I was already playing. The closest comparison I can make is a crossword. In each segment, you're given a text-based clue, often obtuse, accompanied by a few images. The solution must then be spelled out by selecting from a collection of letter clusters, almost like a combination lock.It's unlikely that you'll figure out the answer just by looking at the letters; either you already know the very specific piece of trivia, of you're off to Google and Wikipedia. Maybe you grab a keyword from the clue, or maybe you take a screenshot and do a reverse image search. Each unsolved answer has a number of hints that you can unlock (they tell you increasingly-specific things for you to go web-search), but the player is only allowed 5 total hints per calendar day, so getting stuck is a near certainty, especially on clues with little or no text at all.In-game content is presented as ""The Dream World"" while ""The Waking World"" refers to everything outside the game software: your web searches, the game's official forum, and the fictional content housed in real web pages that were developed for the ARG component.I don't know whether I finished the game or not. I have all the achievements, and I was given some text exposition about a particular character, but nothing to really indicate that it was over from a gameplay standpoint. There's nothing left for me to interact with on the main board, but maybe I just missed something.The sounds and visuals are very well-done. The music is nice, and the vocal work is good. I picked up a mispronounced word and a sentence that was read twice in a row, but that's pretty forgivable considering I wasn't expecting fully recorded narration in the first place.I don't really think that the ARG aspect is broadcast strongly enough on the store page. It's my own fault that I didn't notice the single above-the-fold mention, but I was focusing on the multiple mentions of puzzles.Fun is subjective, and I'm sure plenty of people really love ARGs. I have never been happy about games hijacking my web browser, and at least this game's external social media component doesn't actually require player registration. I personally don't get why the content and lore couldn't all be housed within the confines of the game, so I just have to assume that it's ARG for ARG's sake, and that the novelty of taking the game outside the software is what drives the experience for fans.That said, there is a lot of craftsmanship here, and I do appreciate the amount of work and planning that went into creating this game. If ARGs are your thing, you'll probably have a good time with it, and if you've played and enjoyed The Black Watchmen, the odds are even more in your favor."
,Recommended,449730,31607085,Posted: 7 May,all,Manatierchen,"I stubled upon Ahnayro by accident and it sounded intriguing, so I bought it - and I loved it! It's research-based, so it shows you combinations of pictures, words (or short texts) and audio and you have to do research in the ""real world"" (aka Google) to find out what connects them. Some riddles are easier (which does not mean easy) and some are really tricky. Of course there's a story behind all that as well, but to be honest I was more interested in the riddles. I was surprised how much I learned from all the research, so you're getting educated while having fun. Yay!The only thing that bothered me a little was that for the research you kinda need to have a second monitor or a second pc next to you. Otherwise you need to switch a lot between browser and game which can be annoying.Also, it could have been longer - I would definitely keep playing!"

The system is somewhat vague at first but once you get used to it you'll soon find yourself browsing the internet (the Waking World as it is called in-game)  to connect items, symbols, events and places. The story that slowly unfolds is certainly fun for those who enjoy playing Freudian and Jungian games."

,Recommended,449730,31110174,Posted: 12 April,all,rknight,"Fantastic, eerie, and thought-provoking.  In another review, someone complained that the 'puzzles' are more like research, and this is completely true, and it's also why I love the game.  Most of the answers are a few web searches away, provided you figure out the right questions to ask, and then fuzz up your brain a bit to recognize the hints they're dangling in front of you.  The light dawns, you go 'Aha!', and then the puzzle that once seemed really hard now feels totally fair.   Recommended for folks that like the dustier areas of the library."
,Recommended,449730,33099330,Posted: 1 July,all,synthanatos,"Here is the game: diving into ""tables"" and sub-tables on a weird pocketwatch-looking ""artifact,"" you are presented with 3-5 images and a short text fragment. The fragment is an ambiguous clue to a word which can be entered into a ""sigil"" to solve the puzzle; resolving the ambiguity requires both identifying the images and figuring out what links them together. Google, especially reverse image search, will be your friend.I'll be honest: if the idea of ""doing research for fun"" seems absolutely horrible, then this game won't redeem it for you, but if it sounds like a good time, then it's a FANTASTIC purchase (especially at the sale price). If you're the sort of person who regularly falls down wikipedia holes for hours on end, you're going to have a great time. Some of the puzzles are a little... iffy (I actually agree wholeheartedly with the analysis in the RPS review), but on the whole I really enjoyed my time with Ahnayro. It is Super Not For Everybody, but if you've read the description, understood the concept and still think you might like it, it absolutely delivers on that promise."

,Recommended,449730,33358402,Posted: 7 July,all,sophie9709,"What is real anyway?This game is not for the faint hearted or the superstitious. It is an ARG that blends fiction with reality so well I sometimes had to step back to reassess what is real and what is not. There are fake websites to explore, passwords to find, and even blogs to read. Which organisations are real and which ones are made up? Are any of the things mentioned have a real life basis? What is supernatural and what is more grounded? Because of the whole disorienting nature of the game I would recommend playing it late at night when your mind is more susceptible to mind screws. The game's creepy nature is at its strongest then.But that I admit is not the focal point of the game. The point is to research. Lots of it. Working out what the clue is telling you, researching for the keyword, and inputting it. It is like an intense version of crosswords except the words are esoteric and you have some help with the spelling. Some of the puzzles link up with previous answers being clues to the next ones. Other times you have to divine (yes, that is a verb, fight me) the answer from reading fictional documents. The puzzles are not just limited to the game itself. As said before you need to find passwords for the fake websites linked to the game. They not only provide clues to the puzzles but also the plot itself.Ah yes, the plot. Easily the hardest puzzle of the game. What on Earth is going on? I was left with more questions than answers but I think it is not necessarily the game's fault. For one this game is a spinoff of another game The Black Watchman, which I have not played yet. For another like all good puzzle games this one never did give up its secrets so easily. I might understand more in a few day's time after some musing. All I know is that sleep clinics are creepy.The presentation of the game itself is gorgeous, The well-polished steampunk aesthetic is bolstered by vintage photographs and nice colour schemes. The voice acting is beautiful. The symbols are a nice touch and I like how responsive the game is. Every action has a reaction and you know what is going on.Overall, this puzzle game got me to question reality and amazed me in how immesive it was. I think the game has also made me smarter, considering I now know waaayyyy more about spiritualism, ghosts, and death than your average person."

At the same time, it's still a single-player game, theoretically solvable by a single person (at least the core of it).

While I wasn't given a free copy of this game, I have played through the demo and liked what I saw enough to purchase the game. My steam play time does NOT reflect the time put into this game. I had to get this out as soon as I could.Hey, you! Do you like researching obscure topics, complex puzzles or staring at your computer with pursed lips for what feels like eternity? Then I have the game for you! Ahnayro is a game based around the dreams of you, the player. After the system clock on your computer hits 7 PM, anything goes. Be prepared to listen, google, cry and most importantly, think.The devs REQUIRE you to google things, you will find yourself learning things. Things that will make you think. Things that will make you shudder. Things that were never meant for human thoughts. (As a side note, in A&S's main game The Black Watchmen, I found myself in a massive rabbit hole after finishing off a mission about some cultists. There is some good reading related to these games.)The community around here is great. The people on the forums and IRC may seem like a strange lot but I promise you they won't bite. If you neex help, feel free to ask! Just don't go expecting to get a straight forward answer! I was once given a hint in the form of a limerick by a drunk person.My one warning is for people who don't think they are any good at complex puzzles.
