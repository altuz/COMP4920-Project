Why cant I just beat the pulp out of any female guard instead of sending the male guards at them?3: The daughter of Darkness herself is hand drawn and so is all of the death screesn and SCPs, But why are all of the scientists just cropped out Anime Characters? I don't think a lot of time was put into this game considering there is no setting to change the resolution or any other setting at all.This was fun to play but there were too many flaws to call it an SCP game."

,Recommended,449820,22299887,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,Erbkaiser,"Daughter of Shadows is a puzzle sidescroller that takes inspiration from various SCPs, from the well-known Wiki.As a girl who can mind control any men and then use these men as extra health, use them to operate computer terminals, or to kill women who SCP-029 cannot otherwise affect, your goal is to find two keys and unlock the main facility to be able to escape.The game uses randomly generated rooms so you will not always encounter the same things.The main draw is the many SCPs included. While there are certainly inaccuracies in how they are depicted and how they act, the game does more right than wrong here. You will need to know about most of them, or have the Wiki open to check, to get the full experience though.Downsides are obviously the production values. It is a low budget game with not so pretty art and almost no sound. There is no background music and the sound effects all seem very stock.Recommended for its low price and connections to SCP lore, but if you're not interested in the SCP project then this has llittle to offer that other games can't do better."

As a fellow indie dev however, I understand how hard it is to bring something you love to life. This just isn't a good product of that love.

76561198042175534,Recommended,449820,22245698,"Posted: 4 April, 2016",all,Badman Johnny,"Daughter of Shadows: An SCP Breach Event is a 2D (2-dimensional) sidescroller where you play as SCP-029, the Daughter of Shadows/Darkness/Night, which can bend men to her will, a core feature of the game. The game starts off with the SCP Foundation having a power outage and you escape your cell as a result of SCP-106 who brings you to his dimension (he is seen in the popular SCP Containment Breach game).Objective:The main objective is escape the facility. There are several familiar SCPs that serve as enemies such as SCP-173 who will snap your neck (most recognizable in SCP: Containment Breach),a bengal cat and several more, as well as regular SCP guards who will try to take you down. You must gather minions to protect you and those can only be men as that is her power. Essentially it's a survival game, as it's a SCP free-for-all, yet you are the only one that really wants to leave. You'll need to get 2 keycards and activate the emergency power to escape which is randomized on every run. A familiar SCP will also be able to help you escape if you encounter it during a lucky run.Controls:You move using A for moving left and D for moving right. W is for going through doors and accessing interactive things such as PCs, signs, etc. S is for sending out your thugs to attack whatever is in front of you. H is for healing if you meet the SCP that can do that. Spacebar is possessing men to act as human shields and your main source of attack.Graphics:Simple, yet good enough to recognize the setting and NPCs.Game Mechanics:The spawn locations are randomized on each run (you start from beginning every time you die), but room layout can be similar for the rooms every time (some slight changes may occur). The SCPs that you encounter will also be randomized on each run as well.Tutorial is straight-forward that teaches the main mechanic of possession/mind-control.Con:The only major con that people may find annoying is that you have to go through the tutorial every time you restart, although it takes only like 1 minute if you skip all the talking.tl;drGood sidescrolling rogue-like SCP game with many achievements that places you into the role of an SCP trying to escape.Score:9/10Nice little indie game with a familiar setting and solid gameplay for a $1.09 CDN. I don't regret the purchase at all! I actually got it for $0.65 (40% sale) which is a steal."
,Recommended,449820,22248908,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,Marybelle,"2D sidescroller with a certain random element as far as I can tell. It functions alright and provides rather little content (finished it easily within like half an hour or so?) but it certainly does have replay value.Assets look sometimes crude and sometimes out of place as if they were taken from something else, but that said, everything is really FINE for this price tag. No game breaking bugs or anything I could see.It would be nice if you could skip the intro a la the game ""SCP Containment Breach"" but it really isn't a huge deal.Most of your favorite SCPs will be there (mostly from the Series I as far as I can tell) and trying to kill you just as you could wish for, and it is fun to wander around the (admittedly tiny) complex to find some that you haven't seen yet in previous playthroughs. Most of the more dangerous and active ones will start hounding you outside of their containment areas after being encountered initially (except SCP-106 who is there from the start) and there's actually different death screens for each of those that are capable of killing you (although the variety isn't huge by any means).The difficulty is a bit sporadic since you can potentially die in one hit, or instantly from some of the more dangerous SCPs, that is also fine and to be expected.All in all I like the game, but I have to say that SCP-029 here doesn't look anything like you would imagine from the description, and despite being supposedly a formidable threat just by herself, capable of ""using any object as a weapon"" and apparently possessing dexterity and physical reactions four times higher than an average human; here, she is reduced to being completely defenseless, relying on her converted zombie-like underlings that function as a blend of body armor, ammunition and access cards (it'll make sense once you played it), resulting in the hilarious situations when the enemies can sort of shoot themselves if you convert them while their slow moving bullet was in mid flight towards you.Even idle, stationary scientists (non-combatants) are capable of killing you if you repeatedly walk into them (or just once while immersed in light), which I found a bit silly.tl;dr - The game is functional and pretty enough to look at, gives you some insight in the SCP foundation and allows you to play as a dangerous Keter-type SCP yourself and find out how she interacts with other SCPs. At this price, I'd certainly recommend it, even more so if you can get a discount.Sincerely,- SCP-1715"
,Recommended,449820,29539246,Posted: 28 January,all,High Impact Sniper Rifle,"If you ever wanted to play SCP: Containment Breach but you found it too scary or hard (like me, lol), this is a game for you. You play as an SCP who is trying to escape, has limited means of defense and (for some reason) the whole facility is trying to kill you.You will explore, run, dominate, kill, run, hack and steal to be able to get out. All packed in beautiful black, white and grey color combination, weird sounds and controls that will make you question your life decisions. :3This is not AAA game, but I don't care. I liked it and I think many SCP fans would too if they would try it. And for 1€ it's not unbearable investment even if you'd later find out that it's not your cup of tea.And a one more point; without the DLC the game feels so plain and empty, as you miss on a lot of SCPs, that it basically forces you to buy it to make playing interesting."

It's ugly, the gameplay is repetitive and controls are hit-or-miss. It reads like a bad Flash game from the early 2000's."

,Not Recommended,449820,22348857,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,FlyingSockCat,"The graphics are worse than if you drew them in MS Paint.They somehow screwed up SCP-173's, the most iconic SCP's, model.Every time you die, you restart from the begining. This wouldn't be bad if you didn't have to go through the intro cutscene each time.There is pretty much no sound except bad background music.You CAN skip almost all of the game, and pretty much everything is uneccessary to completing the game if the map generates that way.This game assumes you have read 2000+ SCP articles because a good number of the SCPs are not explained in game.I beat the game in 22 minutes, minus waiting through the intro cutscene many times, and minus trying to find out if I could up the graphics.Even for a buck, this is not worth it.If you are an SCP fan, just play Containment Breach, it's much better and free."

I don't expect them to be very long at that price, but something they all had was a save feature.Its like a flash game from early newgrounds, I feel it was a first attempt at a game that... shouldn't really go on steam. I don't want to be too harsh because it feels like there was a lot of effort put into making it and I'm sure there's parts that the developer is proud of, the possessing males is a cool idea along with playing as one of the SCP creatures-I can't get very far in the game as the hitboxes for doors seem to be completely off, I can only enter them by spamming w and walking around the area the door is in. Perhaps the game runs on the canvas system and the ancors for the colliders are messed up...?I would really like to like this game xD"

,Not Recommended,449820,22724691,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,LonM,"Don't go near this game. Even if it's cheap.The graphics in this game are the worst I've ever seen. Even at maximum settings they are blurred beyond recognition.The sound in this game isn't great either. Throughout I can hear the music, yes, but there's also this wierd hissing/humming/screechign sound which sounds like bad audio compression.The gameplay itself isn't fun. The place is a labyrinth, I get that. That's fine: lots to explore. But you have no map, and each time you 'die' you have to restart the game. This means you have to go through the intro sequence, making you likely to forget where you were in the first place anyway.The controls aren't great either. A lot of the time any of the controls other than A and D feel unresponsive.As far as the story goes, the whole SCP thing is fine, but this game doesn't really add much to it. You have some of the contained objects that you can encounter and so on, but it doesn't really feel any more impressive than just reading text about them on the SCP wiki.A lot of people talk about 'bad joke' games on steam. This goes beyond even that."
,Not Recommended,449820,34204452,Posted: 12 August,all,The Cancer Man,"The graphics are extremely pixalated, it wouldn't be a problem but you can see where they took an image they made and cut, copy, and pasted which makes it worse than it really is. The tutorial teaches you next to nothing on how to play the game, the keys blend so well into the background I had to teach myself how to enter doors with ""w"" and while on the topic of entering doors you have to be exactly on the tiniest invisible marker on the door to enter to go to the next room. Be ready to learn to memorize everything because there's no save feature so if you die no matter where you are it's time to start completely over. The story is non existant, it's supposed to be someone's take on a character they made for the S.C.P. universe but it should have stayed that way, just someones story, not all stories are meant to become more than just that, best example of when I'm buying this is The Dark Tower, if you've read the books and seen the movie then you'll know what I mean."

,Not Recommended,449820,31048996,Posted: 9 April,all,Paleknight,"It's better than Youth Drainers, but crappy and not very fun nor exciting. It looks more like it should be on newgrounds to be honest. Controls are stiff even when trying to get into doors. Enemies that require you to look at them while trying to escape is a problem too specially in one room. Because of that room to get a security card praying that there is no fast moving statue chasing you from below. Otherwise your only option is to restart the game or lose pretty much almost all your health attempting to get away. Not sure how many other rooms do this, but I am pretty sure there are a few others. Not to mention nice using an image from a hentai game by the way."
