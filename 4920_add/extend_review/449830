For me if this game was only MLE I'd not buy it I admit but if you combine it with MLU and MLA it makes sense and enriches the other two stories.A porn game;This was the other biggest complaint people seem to have.When it was released the ML series was classed as Eroge which is basicaly otaku for a VN with porno scenes in it.If you look up at the screen shots you will see pictures of the 'flight' suits that are revealing for no other reason than fan service and people seem to blast that too.Problem is. Fan service will exist in most forms of anime/VN/LN its just a thing.Why hate on a game's story simply because you see boobs?Do boobs ofend you? If it does why are you bothering with the review section? Its clear they are in the game.The steam version is the all ages version so all sex scenes are removed but as a person who has read sex scenes I can tell you they were shoe horned into the game only to appeal to the pervy otakus back in 2001 when it was EXPECTED to have those types of scenes, Fate stay night another famous VN which has since had succsesful anime ALSO had these types of scenes.As a side note for people who are waiting for the 18+ patch take my advice when I say the sex scenes are pretty bad and just put into it 'because' if you really want porn there are plenty of free sites I am sure you know about already.TLDR; The game is not about sex. It has sexual content with the 18+ patch that will come eventualy but its not worth caring about. People bashing the sexual content in this game are prudes. If you are prude avoid and gtfo.StoryOf all things some sites bash the story.As a person who has finished the series I will say that for me out of all the games I have played over the past 24 years (alot) and as a person who focuses on story driven games when Im going single player-This is the best story of them all.It has to be due to the games nature but this story is amazing.It will make you FEEL something about what is going on.If you have a soul you WILL cry at certain points.You will think about it will you study or are at work, you won't be able to wait to know what happens next and after its all over and you clear MLA you will feel like you just walked through hell and came out alive with all the good and bad feelings to go with that.For me story wise you would have to get into some serious novels to get anything better.I am talking about enjoyment factor and the idea of caring about what is going on in this game.If you are a person who enjoys anime in general then you need to read this, it is your duty.If you enjoy Sci Fi and are no put off by any of the other content you have seen so far then you have to read this.If you enjoy a bit of romance in your action story then you have to read this.If you are a weeb, i guess you have already read this and if not you are a slacker.If you like mecha this ♥♥♥♥♥ on any other mecha story out there.If you like reading and don't mind anime themed stuff then read this.If you get offended at any of the screen shots I guess you have to pass but thats your issue really and its you who will miss out simply because you can't see past the cover.9999/10"
76561198006890984,Recommended,449830,24436575,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,LordLucifer,"So. By Now you've seen all the reviews from all the people who have played it before. Every single one basically has the same message, put out in different terms. But you're there wondering, okay, I'm a noob, I don't know VN, or any of this stuff, and I've never played Muv-Luv. Where's my voice so I can make an educated decision?I'm that voice.Heads up, I've been aware of VN's but never been able to get them or figure any way of making them work, so the closest I've gotten to this kind of game is my love for anime/manga/manhwa. That, and reading some reviews and getting the genre shift spoiled for me is as far as I had knowledge wise heading in.First thing's first. I loved Muv-Luv Extra. I loved the characters. The humor made me laugh. I enjoyed the world. I enjoyed the different routes I played. I enjoyed the harem aspect. I enjoyed working to find one route/girl to pick and seeing where it went. I enjoyed the cartoons/journal drawings. I think Meiya is best girl, but ayamine is most interesting. I liked the mutual violence between Sumika and the MC. I was happy playing that game. I do not agree with other's who say that that Extra is trash. Even without playing Alternative, maybe because I haven't played a thousand other games just like Extra, I had a blast. Do I believe Alternative is the best ever, and ties in and builds up the other two? A hundred thousand times yes. I was looking for forshadowing but couldn't really find or feel any, so if they are as intertwined as promised my mind is really blown.Why am I so confident that Alternative is everything they are promising us it is?Unlimited is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. If Extra made me happy, Unlimited got me pumped. The  production values went through the roof, and there were so many cooooooooollll moments and plot stuff. It was like if you liked Code Geass, but you got to sit in it and read it and enjoy it in immersion at your own pace. And it felt like this was only the first half of season one. Meaning I could kinda sense I still had like 2 or 3 wild balls to the walls arcs to go. I don't think I'll be dissapointed in the payoff.Let's be clear though. This was not meaningless build up just for Alternative. Even if I die before Alternative is released or it goes dark, I won't be sad for my time or money. 9.5/10. Great story. Great Fun. Making Steam great again, and I hope we get more awesome Visual Novels in the months and years to come. What a great genre."

,Recommended,449830,34537880,Posted: 27 August,all,Murikov,"«The first 20+ hours of the game are spent in light hearted atmosphere where the player gets to interact with standard anime girls. Even the beginning of Muv-Luv: Alternative is a power trip where the supersoldier protagonist breezes through basic training and displays his superior piloting skills (mecha otakuness pays off in the end). AND THEN IT GRABS YOU BY THE HAIR, PULLS YOU UP AND STARTS F***ING YOU IN YOUR FACE.»- Anonymous board user describing his experience with the Muv-Luv trilogyMuv-Luvis massive, by all means.What on the first glance looks like a generic high-school-romance visual novel in fact turns into a dramatic SciFi / mecha / military-themed universe which took many influences from other franchises such asStarship Troopers,EvangelionorGunbuster. TheMuv-Luvfranchise was actually so successful that meanwhile it expanded into numerous sequels, spin-offs, light novels, anime series and much more.To begin with, this particular release ofMuv-Luvconsists of two separate games which you can select from in the main menu,ExtraandUnlimited.Extracan be considered as a lighthearted introduction to the main characters whileUnlimitedfinally introduces you to the serious SciFi world in which the franchise mainly takes place.Personally I interpret both games as an overly long prologue to the amazing 50 hours longMuv-Luv: Alternative, the third game of the original trilogy which many players consider one of the best visual novels ever made (notincluded in this particular release, sold separately). That being said you need to bring up the patience and effort to read through bothExtraandUnlimited, since in total it takes about 30 hours until you've seen all the endings. And to be honest, some routes and story branches in both games are not even that interesting. For instance I foundAyamine'sroute inExtraexhaustingly tedious.BUT (and here it gets interesting) it still pays off if you read through everything and therefore immerse yourself intoMuv-Luv's characters and world, since later in the third game a huge chunk of the story touches upon that. After sucking in all that whatExtraandUnlimitedoffered, finishing the third game will be one of the most rewarding and complete visual novel experiences you might ever have.Therefore especiallyExtramay leave you rather unimpressed at first, but the experience definitely takes epic proportions by the time you finished both games and finally startAlternative.In case you never played any visual novel before, here's the deal: You read yourself through textboxes and occassionally make decisions that to some extend change the outcome of the ending. Everything is accompanied by CGs, an appropiate soundtrack and sometimes even by voice actors. What may sound pretty boring to many is in fact pretty intense. Visual novels have the pace and format to tell such detailed and immersive stories that animes, movies or TV shows can't equally pull off due to their technical limitations. What a movie cramps down to 2 hours, a visual novel makes you experience in 40.The story ofMuv-Luvputs you in the shoes of Takeru, a regular, rather lazy Japanese high school student who's into mecha arcade games, good food and the comforts of life. He is best friends with Sumika, the girl next door who spent all her childhood with him. When he's not spending his spare time with her or his other buddy Mikoto in the local arcades, he's usually goofing around at school and interacting with his mostly female classmates. But everything changes as one day Takeru wakes up in his bed - next to a unknown, mysterious girl...Telling anything more would already result in spoilers, but rest assured that you'll adore theMuv-Luvtrilogy if you like SciFi-themed anime with military / mecha / conspiracy / traumatizing vibes to it. The later parts specifically reminded me of Verhoeven'sStarship Troopers, which I already mentioned before.Now theMuv-Luvgames initially started asErogevisual novels with some kinky +18 scenes in it. This particular Steam release (also known asAll-Agesversion) has all of the H-scenes removed due to Steam's content policies. The developers / publishers solved this problem by offering a separately availableDirector's Cut patchthat unlocks the +18 CGs in the game. While that's technically a good solution, the bad news is that you need to fork out another $10 for that patch, which is quite a rip-off in my opinion. In the end it doesn't even affect that many CG's and scenes, which arepixelizedanyway due to Japanese pornography law. Furthermore personally I didn't like the kinky scenes that much since they kinda feel out of place considering the intense story and all - but that's up to you.So, should you get it?If all that already sounds too long and tedious for you, then just leave it be. You'll most likely get bored after a few hours of listening to Sumika's annoying chatter.But if you're ready to dive into this universe that later shines with excellent world-building and geekiness, then come on board and enjoy this rollercoaster full of excitement, emotions, blood and tears. Consider this release as an overly long prelude toMuv-Luv: Alternative, which will most likely blow you away completely.6 out of 10 Yakisoba Pans, if you look at both first games from a individual perspective8 out of 10 Henyus, if you put both first games it in context with the complete trilogy«That purple haired girl has interesting and seemingly impossible polygonal shaped hair.»- Random normie comment about one of the protagonists"
,Recommended,449830,32977590,Posted: 29 June,all,Blitzkrieg,"Muv-Luv in all honesty is enthralling tale, about how vastly different one's perspective can shape the world, but most of all how the present is always changing and nothing is set in stone. However, unlike today's more recent visual novels, where the lengthy and juicy bits are not an issue, muv-luv has a very slow uptake and deserve the readers undivided attention, to fully grasp the meaning behind them.The difference between extra and unlimited are like day and night, but both cannot exist without the other, since the both complete each other in a way, only after reading both parts, would the reader fully understand, sadly extra falls in comparision when seperated from unlimited. Tho, the same cannot be said of unlimited. Another wonderful statement, is how different environment can easily change a person's behaviours and values despite being the same person. Goes to show how flexible these characters are.I highly recommend people to prepare and enjoy the ride, one measely mishap can easily ruin the experience, thus reading in moderation might be the best, since some part are best savoured before moving onward."

As someone who had read Muvluv Extra, Muvluv Unlimited, and Muvluv Alternative, I can honestly say it was one of my favorite stories I've had the pleasure to read. These first two parts of the Muvluv trilogy, Extra and Unlimited, are essential to fully enjoy Alternative, the best part of Muvluv.Extra and Unlimited (the two parts included in this purchase) will probably range from good to mediocre depending on your tastes. The first two parts of the Muvluv trilogy are lighthearted and comical. However, even if your not a fan of Extra and Unlimited's more carefree tone, I highly reccomend you still read them. This is because of the final part, Alternative. ""But the first two parts of Muvluv take around 30-50 hours to read. Is it really worth slogging through them if I don't like it for Alternative?"" Yes...yes it is.Muvluv Alternative is a dark and grueling experience that many, including me, would say is a contender for the best Visual Novel ever made. Despite its cute appearance, Muvluv is not for the faint of heart. If you don't feel things by the end of Muvluv, either you weren't paying attention or you're a heartless alien uncapable of human emotion. To tell you anything else about Muvluv would just spoil the experience.Anyone who is a fan or visual novels or just dark, mature stories in general will love Alternative. Sadly, Alternative is not included in this purchase, so make sure to buy that too (when it is released on steam later this year). Trust me, its worth every penny.Remember for every copy of Muvluv sold, one less person gets a Drill Milky Punch#StopChildhoodFriendAbuse"

Higurashi, Umineko, Clannad, seriously I could list them all day. (Hate me for picking popular VNs for my examples if you like though). I have to say, if the writing is THIS good for the beginning of this VN series, I'm crazy hyped for the sequel/finale Alternative!I'm a sucker for sappy stories, but the sweet parts are sweet, funny parts are funny (mostly, I give them like a solid B- on most of the comedy), the art and music are good.Heheheheh....and that shocking second half! I haven't gone though ALL the content just yet (I'll update this when I do) but I feel I've got to go ahead and recommend this game anyway. It's great!

,Recommended,449830,31229280,Posted: 18 April,all,FALprofessional,"Having taken approximately 42 hours to complete one ending for Extra and one for Unlimited, I feel I am now worthy to review this VN. Let's start from the beginning. Extra starts rather slow. It has solid amounts of comedy. Your typical slice-of-life setting. However, it really takes off in Unlimited. It is worth the wait, that is all I will say. Given the nature of Muv-Luv's narrative setup, the promotional videos and descriptions unfortunately kind of spoil the eventual flow of the plot, which makes Unlimited a tad less impactful, but by no means does it spoil the lot of it.It honestly reminds me of Steins;Gate, Sunrider, and eden*, all games which I have played/completed. Steins;Gate in the respect of it being slow to start, with a sudden significant realization that entirely shifts the narrative flow, and the pace gets exponentially faster. Sunrider with some of its sci-fi aspects. eden* with its narrative premise. Having solid knowledge on all four of the games, I have come to realize that they are related in more ways than one, and the satisfaction of that realization is/was amazing. Like an ""Ah-hah"" moment. In no way am I saying they were intentionally related, I am just mentionally what I realized and became so gitty about.Furthermore, it stands the test of time. For being a VN from 2003, it's animations, character/background CGs, and audio are fairly impressive. And, for not being 4:3 aspect ratio, I salute this game. I'll admit that some of its soundtracks get kind of annoying and repetitive, but that was really no big downside. They were still enjoyable.TL;DR: Can't wait for Alternative!"

I wasn't expecting much from it. I remember reading that it was some amazing visual novel and that it would be getting translated to English in the near future. Then I saw the Kickstarter for it.Long story short, I figured, 'If this game was amazing in Japan and a lot of people into visual novels praise it, I should at least attempt it before calling it quits on getting into visual novels.'I'm glad I made that decision, because Muv-Luv is funny and entertaining.

Amazing stuff and I'm looking forward to spending hours going for alternative endings, etc.Also, this visual novel is by far better than the game: No Man's Sky. In-fact, you should purchase this visual novel over No Man's Sky any day. In-fact, since it's much cheaper, you might as well buy two copies of Muv-Luv or more (equivalent to the over priced No Man's Sky) and gift them out to friends. That's how good Muv-Luv is. It's even better than anything Valve has released in the last 5 years."

It's actually a prequel to a better game, but stands well on it's own.Muv-Luv Extra, the first half of this game, is fairly typical.  It would be an okay game on it's own, but nothing particularly outstanding.  It follows the standard template of a harem/comedy visual novel.  Anyone familiar with the genre won't be much surprised by anything.  If you happen to not be especially fond of them, for the sake of the other games' story you really only need to finish either Sumika or Meiya's route.Muv-Luv Unlimited, the second half, is quite different, in a good way.  Building on the first game, the characters you've known get thrown into a much more serious situation, and it draws you in to that upside-down world quite well.  It's a war story, with some of the original game's comedy thrown in.And while Umlimited is good, it can all be considered part of the build up to the final game which is not included here, Muv-Luv Alternative.  Alternative is one of the best visual novels out there, and you don't get the full experience unless you play this game first."

This VN you are purchasing here however, is the first two stories, while Muv-Luv Alternative (the final story) is due sometime in the near future. What you get here is Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited. One is a highschool harem romance as it is advertised to be and one is...well a military academy romance.Let's start with Extra. It is cliche. It is a highschool romance by the book. The genre is generally very dull for me and while I enjoyed going through two routes, the other endings were a drag to go through. You have to start from the beginning for most of them. I skipped through most of the text I'd seen to speed this up because the writing isn't enjoyable to reread that many times. Basically, if you like highschool romance genre, shoot for it. You'll love it. I liked it, but I'm not over the moon for it.Unlimited follows up on Extra. Unlimited is why I'm recommending this and why I am in love with it. The story is well written and works a lot more on world building, which makes it feel a lot more effort was put into it. Characters have modest development and the romance feels....less forced? I mean it is forced still, but you aren't being beaten over the head with it. It comes at an enjoyable pace for someone like me who cringes at that type of trope. It kept you wondering what was going to happen next unlike Extra which was pretty easy to guess because it was so tropey. The ending of the story is your choice, butit ends on a cliffhanger regardless. Having seen the endings, I can say that I am genuinely excited for the conclusion for the trilogy when I came into this VN based on recommendation alone.Overall, buy it for Unlimited is just my personal recommendation. If you like sci-fi mechs, then do it. This story is really well done and sets you up for the finale."

At the end you pick one and get a happy ending and it's all good, right? Well, now you're attached to the characters.

Unlimited strikes you, and the feels will CHOMP you like no tomorrow. Marimo and Yuuko are hilarious, and actually not as cliche as the rest of the characters. The main guy is rather douchy, but does have redeeming qualities. Sumika is the most average of them all, really nailing the cliche of cliche. Dont be disheartened though (for many reasons muwahaha), for there is Meia. She is the cliche rich girl who'll do whatever for Takeru (main guy), but she is so well made that you'll forget that, and truly she made the game for me.

The characters are fantastic, each with their own quirks and interesting, deep personalities.  The pacing is solid as well, it doesn't get you severely bored or disinterested by doing the dumb things subpar VNs do.  Each of the routes carries its own weight and fleshes out the characters that much further. You won't finish a route and wonder why you wasted your time on it.  Everything has its purpose here, from tiny, subtle character interactions to big plot twists and developments.Then you hit part 2, Unlimited (also included here), and the game changes.I don't mean that literally, it's still a VN.  But it's like night and day.   The series shows its true colors, and you are presented with sci-fi so good it sucks you in and leaves you wondering when the hell we'll get Alternative.Final Thoughts:  If you're familiar with VNs, grab this one.

,Recommended,449830,24332453,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Appriser,"IMPORTANT: The playtime shown does not reflect my actual playtime for this VN. I previously read the fan translations of both Muv Luv and Muv Luv Alternative, and will base this short initial review on those experiences.I should start by saying that the Muv Luv trilogy is the best piece of fiction I've ever read in visual novel format. From start to finish the story was very well thought out and designed, each instalment building upon and surpassing the last. Despite its flaws (read: Extra) you absolutely have to read the whole thing if you're a fan of visual novels.Previously I'd found it difficult to review or recommend this VN to others for two reasons:-because my words can not do it justice. I recommend reading the top reviews on this page if you haven't already;-because it's inherently spoiler heavy. Originally Unlimited was not revealed to the reader beforehand, it would be unlocked after finishing Extra as a surprise. Fortunately the English release is not as secretive as the original.I say fortunately because Extra on its own would be a very generic harem romcom in a tired high school setting. I don't think it would be unfair to say that it's actually a hurdle on the way to enjoying this trilogy, despite being a decent VN that contributes a lot to the series. It requires some commitment to get through Extra if the reader's tired of its kind of story, but you'll have to take my word for it that it's all worth it in the end. I recommend reading Sumika's and Meiya's routes at least, because this was the requirement to unlock Unlimited in the original release and they follow roughly the same story path with alternate scenes. I'd give this one a 7/10.After enduring comedic shenanigans in his original universe Takeru the harem protagonist wakes into the darker world of Unlimited. Out of his comfort zone in a fundamentally familiar setting with familiar faces that don't recognise him, Takeru has to adapt to an unfair reality, unsure if he'll be able to return to the world he knew. Unlimited is a much more refreshing experience after Extra, and yet only dips into the depths Alternative goes to. I like to call it a boot camp coming-of-age story, and it's a solid 8/10.At the time this review is being written Alternative is not yet released on Steam. It could be that playing through Muv Luv may leave you unsatisfied with Unlimited's ending since a lot of questions remain unanswered and closure is left to Alternative. I'd recommend to wait until Alternative's release if you prefer to finish a story in one go."

I played/read through all three parts about 4 years ago using the fan sub version, as soon as saw the official English release on steam I knew I had to buy it.The Muv Luv trilogy is a seminal visual novel, which builds your emotional attahment to the characters and their story as you progress through each game.To get the most from the series you need to read them in order, think of Extra as the getting to know the characters/personalities of everyone.  Unlimited is then the introduction to the world/reality and Alternative is the main course.Whilst Extra starts off as your typical high school/dumb guy gets the girl type visual novel it still stands up on its own. Some of the issues covered are hard hitting and emotional.Considering Alternative was originally released 3 years after extra/unlimited you glimpse the ties in during Extra, I missed them the first time around.  Replaying Extra after playing Alternative I spotted themIt is worth completing more than the two main heroine routes to experience these.Unlimited follows a similar format to Extra but because of the new reality the characters are in starts to take on a slightly darker tone but still injects doses of humour.  Which ever ending you go with will still have an impact on you.Overall these two are really worth the time to read/play through, not just for Alternative when its released, but as VN's in their own right."

In total you may end up with a hundred hours to read all three and the story is well worth it.The sprite animations from Alternative is a nice addition to the new release. Other than the system shapeups, clear list and new translation; it is the same story as before.Thoroughly recommended for anyone interested in a great visual novel story, but this is considering the three parts as a whole. While the two parts in this game are both nice on their own, they work best together with the third. If you are worried about the price or losing the threads of the story between now and the coming release of Alternative, feel free to wait a bit. Some may recommend you only read a summary of the these two stories and go for Alternative alone. I encourage you to play through them instead. It is a better way to get to know the characters and the setup for the third cannot be underestimated.While this is an all-ages version and certain parts have been excluded, a restoration patch is on its way for those wanting the extra scenes. For Extra at least I haven't found their departure detrimental, yet to play through Unlimited.So fall in love with the characters, enjoy the story and look forward to the coming of Alternative."

,Recommended,449830,28333456,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,Tale,"It's a hard recommendation on its own. Muv-Luv consists of two VNs, Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited. A third VN, not included, Muv-Luv Alternative is ranked byvndb.orgusers as the #1 VN of all time. Playing through Extra and Unlimited helps build up the characters for that title.But on their own, I can really only give a mild recommendation to Muv-Luv Extra, the first half of this duo. It's a charming and funny story about a guy who wakes up with a strange girl in his bed who turns his world upside down. It's full of heart and zany antics and is an absolute delight whenever focusing on the two female protagonists and the love triangle that develops. I laughed out loud plenty.On the downside it's kind of a standard wacky high school romance. And every side route is unbearably boring.Unlimited takes the great humor of Extra and mostly bins it. With the change to a more serious setting and circumstance, the majority of the zaniness and heart got left behind. What you're left with is a dull military school tale about some kids preparing to fight aliens you never get to see. And some romance thrown in at the last moment. Finally ending with as many cliffhangers as it had plots to begin with.If you anticipate Alternative it could be worthwhile or like a wacky high school romance, pick it up on discount."

I hated Extra with a passion, and skipped the entire stupid Lacrosse arc. However, the little bit of characterization you get out of it is worth it for Unlimited, and I'm assuming Alternative as well. While Extra sucks, take comfort in the fact that hardcore fans of Muv Luv say it sucks as well, for it really does get soooooo much better in the next games. Also, be very careful, as there are spoilers everywhere you look, even in some of these reviews. Just suffer through both main (Sumika and Meiya) routes of Extra, then never return to that terrible part, and enjoy the much better Unlimited and Alternative."

Also, the Muv-Luv Extra is really ordinary and the setting is just too cliched (well, pretty reasonable considering about how old the game is).For Unlimited, I would say it is much better (It is the main story after all), but it lacks the tension that the mecha themed VNs are supposed to have,for the entire game, the 207 squad never encoutered a single alien, and there is no actual combat in the battle field. Also, the endings are literally the same for all of the heronies.But I still recommand this game because.... well, it is Muv-Luv ya know. The prequel ya know. You kind of have to play it before the Muv-luv Alternative. It is as simple as that."
,Recommended,449830,29912662,Posted: 13 February,all,Shuc49,"There are many reviews saying that this is one of the best visual novel in existence. They were not exaggerating. I have not read many visual novels but Muv Luv indeed feels like a one of a kind, unique in the way it approaches storytelling.Just having a good plot and cute girls will not automatically make the visual novel good. This visual novel uses large amounts of visual effects and sound effects (Despite being a visual novel) to bring life to the story. The viewer becomes immersed and engaged, as if you were inside the story feeling what the characters are feeling, seeing what the characters are seeing.The Muv Luv story is told in 2 parts, which are all carefully planned and executed. The difference in the mood between the 1st, 2nd part of this game is substantial, to the point where you can question if it was even the same game. Note, the story is not complete without Muv Luv Alternative, a sequel to this game which is not on steam. You have to play that after this to know the magnificence of the triology. This game, though not giving a satifying conclusion to ther story is still amazing on its own.People going into this game expecting Mecha and a lot of action may be disappointed at the beginning with the seemingly ordinary high school setting in the beginning and even in the second part, but this may as well be treated as a prequel to Muv Luv Alternative where the Mecha action actually is. Those going into this expecting cute fluffy romance will find what they are looking for in the 1st part of Muv Luv, but the 2nd part will come as a shock. You will quickly realise that the 1st part is just there to make you lower your guard, to make you familiar with the main character’s feelings and then when plot advancement occurs you will be just as shocked as the main character.If you play Muv Luv Alternative after this game, by the end the of that game you will be blown away by how flawless it was executed, showing us subtle hints and carefully placed foreshadowing’s in this game, which eventually lead to the build-up to the climax of the story and everything can be pieced together.Muv Luv can only be described as a piece of art. Not story is without flaws, this visual novel will leave many questions that require you to think deeply about it, but in the end you will be satisfied with the legendary ending of this story and look forward to playing the sequel which explains everything.To end this review, don’t hesitate in buying this game. It is worth every penny and gives a solid 40+- hours of well executed story telling. You will marvel at its beauty in the end and have only one thought “Did I beat the game, or did the game beat me?”.(P.S Make sure to play Muv Luv Alternative afterwards to truly know the marvel of this triology)"

I actually think that it is really clever to have the first part of the Muv Luv trilogy be a romantic comedy type of story.  Showcasing these characters in a more ""normal"" setting provides an interesting view when the setting shifts to the bleaker world of Unlimited/Alternative.  Overall I would recommend the game to anyone who finds the idea of a story doing something different with its setting or if you just like robots.In the interest of full disclosure Meiya is best girl"

So, wanting to see what the fuss was about, I got this one and started up.I'm not too sure how I feel about Extra to be honest. It's a very well put together VN, don't get me wrong; decent writing, great characters (except for Takeru, the most insensitive protagonist I think I've ever played as) and well-drawn character and background art. But I felt as though I was still waiting for something significant to happen by the time it ended. However, that's probably a bit harsh on my part considering I haven't explored all Extra has to offer.Unlimited, on the other hand, was definitely where I got heavily invested. Perhaps it's because I'm a sucker for giant robots, but that's not the only reason. The writing, art style and characters all kicked it up a notch. Even Takeru, insufferable he might've been, grew into someone who's somewhat admirable. While no tears were shed by the end of the game, the impact to my feels was definitely felt with the force of a TSF wielding a giant sledgehammer.So yeah, I can now thoroughly accept this is one of the most acclaimed VNs ever, and going through all of this has me just itching to play Alternative to see how it ends. If you consider yourself a fan of visual novels, pick this up and enjoy the ride. Just make sure to grab a box of tissues just in case."
