,Recommended,450050,23770961,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Ashieda,"I love the concept behind this game, and I personally found the artwork quite appealing. Don't have a VR headset myself yet, unfortunately, so I stuck with monitor play, but still found it engaging.The (almost) ""insta-death"" mechanic irked me slightly early on, but since this is evidently a shorter game, I think it's more than acceptable.I found the puzzles enjoyable and adequately mind-bending for my own tastes, and I like the added element of tension the game throws at you with its time paradox mechanic.I'd definitely deem this game worth the 3 dollar price tag.EDIT: A negative I've found while playing the game is a small glitch (or what I assume to be a glitch) that causes your position and/or camera to jitter slightly, reorienting you with no apparent reasoning. It's hardly game-breaking, but it can be jarring and detract from the overall experience."
,Recommended,450050,22866967,"Posted: 8 May, 2016",all,余計 // Needless,"I saw this game thinking something along the lines of ""It's a cheap puzzle game, maybe I can waste a little bit of time before I get tired of it."" So I picked it up, not thinking too much of it. I was thinking to my self, ""how hard can it really be to avoid your past self while solving puzzles? What could they possibly throw at me?""This isn't a long game, which is nice considering the ""perma-death"" aspect. I beat the Normal mode in about 16:10 on my third or fourth run through, first time recording it. I actually really enjoyed playing through it and having to solve the puzzles on a clock. Most of the time I look at timed puzzles and am dissappointed, but these were different. They were easy enough to not take long, but hard enough that I actually had to put some thought into them. Pretty decent design.One of my first thoughts while playing this was ""hey, this might be a good game to speedrun.."" It incentivises it, actually. The faster you can get through the puzzles, the better. I personally plan to speedrun it, and I hope others do as well.All that said, the game has a few issues with it. None really game breaking, but just inconvenient. The physics can be a bit slow and unresponsive, I've gotten stuck between a litteral rock and a hard place, and the camera would randomly jump to a different direction. There's probably a few other minor things I've yet to run into, but those were the most major.If the game were to have a bit more polish, fixing the physics and camera issues, it'd immediately be significantly better in my eyes. I'd love if the developers could go back over and just clean it up a bit, put a little bit of effort into a better play experience. That would be amazing, especially since this game supports VR and those who use it would benefit even more than I."

Looks way better in a 3D headset, but be prepared for motion sickness if you do. Controls in VR are also a bit wonky with pieces not quite going where you want (could REALLY use some tracking controllers to fix that), and the crosshair stuck in your face the whole time is annnoying."
,Recommended,450050,22873058,"Posted: 8 May, 2016",all,Nite_Traveler,"A nice new twist on time travel makes this aptly named ""survival puzzle game"" unique.Short, fast-paced, and increasingly challenging, Yon Paradox sees you completing a series of relatively simple puzzles while attempting to avoid your past selves. With a new ghosted version of yourself appearing every two minutes, you need to work quickly to solve the puzzles and move on to the next area, without being spotted and causing a time paradox, which ends the game. This is fun and exciting, and also a bit nerve-wracking!Fortunately, the puzzles can be better understood each time you play, so you can get through them a little faster each time. The longer you take, the more doubles you create, and the harder it gets to avoid them. This builds a lot of tension organically and keeps you on your toes. It's really a great concept for a game and it's well executed.This isn't a long game, but considering it will take you several run throughs to complete all the puzzles, plus there are a variety of difficulty levels, you can get a decent amount of enjoyment and replayability out of Yon Paradox. For $3, it's a steal.The visual style of this colorful cyber dimension is bold and unique. I look forward to checking this out in VR someday, but it's plenty of fun to play on a regular PC for now. It ran very fast for me and frame rates were great. There are a few puzzles in the starting area that were a bit glitchy for me (devs, I'm thinking of the shapes and gear stacks here). And this gets frustrating when you're trying to complete them as fast as possible. A bit of polish in that area would make this a better experience for me.I look forward to seeing speedruns of this game. Or hilarious speedrun fails. Recommended for fans of puzzle games and time travel. Good luck staying out of your own way!"
76561198117576854,Recommended,450050,28434679,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,Knox,"At first I thought this would be a quick and easy puzzle game, but from the very start the game opens up to be so much more. You are essentially Marty McFly running around an arena solving puzzles, where every 120 seconds another McFly spawns where you started. He is you from the past, and will eventually catch up to you if you're not careful.As you go about solving puzzles unlocking access to other parts of the arena, you must avoid having any of your past selves see you in the future, since this is a time paradox. The game offers fun and engaging puzzles, some of which are randomized while others stay the same and quickly become repetitive each time you play. However, the $3 game does offer varying difficulty levels that shorten the time in which your past clones are created. To those who have beaten impossible mode, I salute you.In the end, this game may not be for everyone. I didn't get the chance to experience it through VR, but I had no problems making my way around the corridors or solving the puzzles. There are rare glitches that cause items to become floaty, but nothing that affects gameplay. If you think the concept sounds cool and don't mind trying over and over to fix your mistakes, definitely pick this game up. I had a blast finding all the routes I could, beating my previous times, and even making it out of the green zone is rewarding enough..."
76561197987014920,Not Recommended,450050,33387389,Posted: 8 July,all,Manxome,"The main conceit of Yon Paradox is that if a past iteration of yourself sees the current version of you, you create a paradox, which means you lose and have to start over.  It's a creative and thematic idea.Unfortunately, it's not so great for puzzle gameplay.  Normally step 1 in solving a puzzle is examining all the parts of the puzzle so you understand the rules and can formulate a solution.  If you do that here, you've just nuked the entire level and left your next iteration no safe place to stand.  I don't see how you're supposed to do anything without intentionally wasting your first try on scouting and then starting over--which might be OK, except that you don't just restart the current puzzle, you go ALL the way back to the beginning.To make matters worse, the boundary where you trigger a paradox is unforgiving and unclear:  the ""sight"" range of your past self doesn't seem to correspond exactly to what you actually saw while playing them, and there is no visual aid for your future self to see where is safe to be or warning when you start to get close.  You can be standing somewhere that seems safe and then just suddenly die.  This takes a difficult mechanic and greatly ramps up the frustration for no apparent reason.And--at least near the start of the game, where I played--the puzzles you're asked to solve do not inspire much hope for clever level design.  Towers of hanoi?  Jigsaw puzzles?  Maybe these are just intended to teach you the UI, but if so, asking the player to redo them on every death is pretty dumb.Finally, the game lacks pretty basic options.  You can't rebind the controls or change mouse sensitivity.  Tedium from waiting for the next time warp could have been greatly reduced by including a simple ""fast foward"" button, but I couldn't find one."

There should be at least some checkpoint system (and im sure everyone is telling that), but i also think that leaving this game at simply just a puzzle is a bit boring. The game feels empty, no dialog, no real story, feels like there should be some sort of tutorial system as well. Overall the game is good but very unfinished from my point of view."
,Recommended,450050,22905716,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,Eighthourblink,"I literally bought this game earlier today ( before todays patch(5/10/16) was released). Before the patch the game did suffer from jutter and puzzles were hard to navigate. But now taht the patch is out, FPS is alot better and grabbing / picking up objects movement is smooth.I have only played about 15 mintues of the game and its something that i will keep on playing to learn more about it. Interseting idea."
,Not Recommended,450050,24493777,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,Kom,"This game is interesting in concept, somewhat fun to play, and brief, but unfortunately it doesn't quite behave that well, which made it hard to enjoy.In my own session, trying to interact with objects in certain puzzles caused them to seize around randomly or outright not follow the cursor, making them difficult, if not impossible to maneuver into specific locations.  Most notably a tangram puzzle, and one involving dragging orbs along lines to highlight nodes, and boxes being picked up that would periodically fall from my grasp.Something that made the issue worse, was that every ten seconds or so, my view would instantly rotate about 45 degrees to the left or right, depending on what direction I'd most recently moved my mouse, causing me to become quite disoriented, especilly while navigating around in rooms or passageways with flat coloration making it hard to discern what direction I'd just come from or was going.Finally, after completing what seemed to be the win condition of the game by collecting all available pieces andplacing all three colored boxes onto their approprate platforms in the blue room, releasing a purple gear (which could not be picked up) and activating a portal, which sent me to the start of the level with the game still running and all other rooms being shown as complete, nothing else happened and I was left wandering through the completed rooms.With more well-behaved physics interactions, some kind of fix for the view shifting issue, and a win condition (or more likely whatever I had missed just being a bit more visible) then this game would definitely be recommendable."

It definately needs some polish and it can behave a bit wonky at times but its pretty cool. The reason I am giving this a thumbs down is for how SICK it made me. OMG the motion sickness. The locomotion is extremely stuttery and gave me one hell of a headache and queasy feeling even after about 15 mins.TLDR; if you get motion sick easy, this game is NOT for you."

,Not Recommended,450050,29994542,Posted: 17 February,all,plato879,"Seriously?This game has too many problems. Some bugs that make it more difficult than it actually is. I love the idea, I hate the way it works. I ragequit every time because it is too difficult, and its controls must be fixed, especially the maximum speed used to move in the map, that only works well when you run right in front of you, it runs a bit slower when you move backward, laterally, even little diagonally, and with such game this is a HUGE problem!I cannot suggest this game to Steam Community, unless someone has enough patience, this game will drive its users mad!Check it out for glitches, because there are not few."

The game is really short, 20 minute long, but you will have to start from the start again and again until you can finish it.I would recommend if you like the idea of speedrunning against all of your past ghosts and like to remember to not go out at specific times.In total, there is 10 puzzles to solve, including a giant maze."
