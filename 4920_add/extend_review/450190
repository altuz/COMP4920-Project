,Recommended,450190,23673516,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,SaltySTL,"Maze Lord is a fantasy and dungeon themed puzzle game. There is no true combat, so if you're looking at this thinking it plays like a board game, it does not.The puzzles in Maze Lord are fun and simple. It is a very casual experience. Each puzzle has a set number of moves in which you must complete it. The more moves left over when the puzzle is finished, the higher your star rating (out of 3). Each star is worth 10 experience.Experience points let you gain account levels. There are certain break points where you need a specific account level or higher to access later game levels. You can always replay the levels to achieve a better star rank and thus more experience.As you complete levels and earn 3 stars, you'll open trinkets. Trinkets can be turned in for rubies. Rubies can be spent to purchase power ups for those tougher puzzles. You can purchase a number of items with rubies (no real money purchases in the game. There is no cash shop...whew!), such as fire to kill a random enemy at the start of the puzzle, a key to unlock a random door at the beginning of the puzzle, a coin to purchase items on the ground, or an extra life point.There are 120 puzzles in Maze Lord. I would say it's well worth the $2.99 price tag, though it has been mentioned in the community hub that the game is free elsewhere. For me, $2.99 ($4.99 after the sale, still worth it) was well worth giving the developer for a game that killed me a bit of time and gave me some fun doing it!"

76561197989580996,Recommended,450190,23642241,"Posted: 18 June, 2016",all,Brentnor,There are 120 dungeons to explore and each chamber has only one solution.  You are rewarded for finding the shortest path to the exit.    New artifacts are unlocked as more traps and monsters appear. This is not an action title or RPG.  It is a strategic brain-game.I recommend  this for any fan of logic puzzles.

,Not Recommended,450190,25811061,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Hem,"This is a very little puzzle game. You can not help but seeing how it was thought as a phone app, not a PC game. And thus, the overall feeling to it, if you don't even take into account the price, is a ""meh..."", and you will quickly forget about it.It's not that the game is bad, there were probably some efforts put into it! It's just that, like all these little smartphone apps, it's more a toy than a real game. Very repetitive, not really rewarding... I don't think I will ever finish it, unfortunately.I dislike not recommending games when they're honestly made, but I can't recommend this one (except if you're looking for such a game on PC)."
,Recommended,450190,25392060,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Gavmandog,"Neat little puzzle game. 120 levels, well designed. The learning curve is good, you have one hard level follow by a couple of easier levels to ease you back into a new concept. Simple and easy to pick up and play.Puzzle games like this usually get more and more impossible but all the levels are doable without requiring too many do overs.I like that it's light with a relatively easy to medium difficulty, with only a handful of hard levels.There can be a bit of frustration but you can try a new path or sit down and map it out in your head. I left a couple that I 1 or 2 starred and came back them later and cleared easier with a fresh mind.7.5/10."
,Recommended,450190,23763938,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Kizlit,"I'm really glad that I picked up this game!  It's a fun little puzzle game that is turned based and low stress.  The 120 puzzles are all on the easier side so I beat the game within ~5 hours.  If you've played Microsoft's new Minesweeper puzzle game, this is similar to that.  The few things that I'd change about this game is that when there's a bonus treasure level, you should be able to just hold the ""down"" key as scrolling all the way down with the mouse is annoying so I completely stopped doing them but all they give you is more rubies so there's really no point.  I also feel like the game should've had a few popups explaining what everything was but it's still easy to figure out.  If you want a little game for cheap and to kill some time, I'd recommend this but if you sit down and play it, you can finish it really fast."

Ending is not exactly an ending, and the last (usually two) achievements require a lot of grinding to get. Grab it for £1 or £2 if you feel like killing time in an afternoon. Don't expect too much."

I love these kinds of puzzle games and the different enemies and items add a demension to it that liven up the genre and make the experience really enjoyable. Some floors seem so easy but the end up deceptively difficult while others can be the other way around, it's a great mix and can keep you on your toes. The level designers did a fantastic job and made sure to keep it from being stale."
,Not Recommended,450190,25363682,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,Picici,"It's all good game until the ""Secret Wall"" stages. You can't tell which wall is passable/impassable until you walk near it, so you have to try walking through each wall, WHILE the game gives fewer stars if you walk too much! Like, seriously!? Is that even skill-based puzzle game!?Another downside is, the steps count written on each level does not mean the minimum step you can pass through the level. The devs don't even know the minimum steps of each level that sometimes you can pass a level with just 10 steps out of 50 steps allowed.For those puzzle lovers, this game isn't SKILL BASED, but LUCK BASED!"

,Recommended,450190,25396830,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,stardustsunday,"Fun little puzzlerThe game comprises many levels, and the objective is to work your way to the exit on every level. You are given a fixed number of moves to do so; if you exceed the given number of moves, you die. After completing a level, you are awarded either 1, 2 or 3 stars based on how many moves you used. To get 3 stars, you must complete that level in the smallest number of moves possible. There is usually only 1 solution.The levels get progressively more difficult, and the obstacles and solutions require increasingly more thought. You also have a small inventory of ""treasures"" picked up along the way that you can sell for in-game boosters. (Though I failed to see why those boosters were needed in the first place.)The game supports both keyboard and mouse, but there are minor bugs using both, especially with item pick-ups.All in all though, this is still a fun title to try. It's a relaxing way to de-stress after a long day and you can just sit back, think about your next move (there are no time limits), and click to get there."

The only bad part that I still hate a lot is that you need to farm for a while after beating the game to get the last 2 achievements. And the farming part isn't optimized.- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------GraphicsIn spite of the little pixelated animation at the beginning and at the end of the game, graphics are great. Every thing is well animated and the level design is colorful.The only real thing is that the game is lack of worlds : you have only 2 kind of patterns/worlds : the castle one with grey walls and tiles and the library with wooden flooring and book shelves.Sounds, MusicYou only have 2 music for the game. One played at the beginning (and maybe that one at the end too) and one for most of the game. So, adding to the same world patterns, it can make you bored.ControlsYou can only play the game with a mouse and or a keyboard. (Controller not supported)Despite using the mouse may seems easier : you just need to click and your hero will choose the fastest way to go there, that trick won't works sometimes : your hero may sometimes take the longest path because a monster or closed door (even if you get the key) is blocking the way.In addition, when you click on a tile which have an item, you need to take it. (Unless your inventory is full.) OR you can use the keyboard to move on that tile without taking it. ( I think you need to press the spacebar to take items.) But most of the case it can work with a mouse by clicking before or after the said tile.GameplayThe gameplay is always improving by adding new features which make every new level more and more challenging to beat with a 3-star rating. Obviously (or not) when they had a new feature into the game, you get a tutorial level which is obvious and simple to beat.To beat a level you need to reach the exit door with a limited number of steps. If you reach the exit with 12 steps or above, you get a 3-star rating which grants you a treasure. Otherwise you will get a lower star rating or you will need to restart again if you have no more steps left.So the game progressively adds new gameplay mechanisms up to 24 features. That includes : new items, new monsters, new traps and new NPCs. And this makes the game very challenging and interesting.You will also unlock 3 features :your inventory where you will see your in-game currency, treasures and othersthe goblin with nasty business where you can donate all your treasures in exchange of a few itemsthe in-game tracking where you can check your progress for your achievementsAchievementsYou will get most of them by beating the first 100 levels. Only 3 are farming related achievements and they only count after you've unlocked the in-game quests tracking. So yes, unless you've beaten every level with 3 stars and got to the bonus level every 5 levels, you will need to farm them for a while.WHY ? Because of a goblin with nasty business. Yes, everyone knows that buying things from a goblin is always too expensive. But that one ? Well its prices always extremely increase every time you buy something.If you are like me, you will need to play 5 levels to get nothing but a bonus room appearing in the levels overview. If you are unlucky you will get a room with secret walls (17% of chance) which you mostly can beat it again on the first try. Obviously the bonus room disappears if you run out of steps. And then you need to have another 5 levels to beat to get a new bonus room.---------------------You want more ?---------------------Steam Curator pagehttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/M123-GRSteam Curator Store Pagehttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/29521492/Reviews Sorted by GenresWork In Progresshttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=964304642"

The object of the game is simple, use the least amout of moves to get to the stairs. Enemies, potions, keys, and doors are the pieces to each puzzle. You can earn up to 3 stars per level that rate how well you did. if you get 3 stars you get a chest with a goblet in it that you can trade for a red gem that allows you to buy cheat items to get through the levels. Every once in a while a past level will have a blue chest icon. If you beat that level in 1 try you get a treasure room for more red gem items. After the first 10 levels, if you lose,  the levels will turn 90 degrees to try and confuse you. Logic is your greatest weapon, beyond that you have plain old trial and error to pass the levels.Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)Graphics: 3 At least they are clean.Playability: 2 It's just clicking on where you want to go. Just walking over a potion doesn't pick it up. You must stop on that square, which is part of the puzzles at times.Fun: 2 Meh, it was kind of fun for the first 10 levels but got boring fast.Sound: 2 Meh again, cellphone game score. Slices and gurgles make up the ""combat"".Replay Value:  1 None! Once you get 3 stars in every level there is no reason to play it again.Final Score: 2Final Thought: Skip it! Maybe if it is free or part of a bundle, but not worth seeking out. I picked it up because I thought it was going to be a dungeon crawler RPG and not a puzzle game."
