Sublevel Zero, a love letter to the Descent franchise as a whole, did a pretty good job at filling that void. But now I'm excited to see what the original guys behind it all have in store for a fully-fledged revival of the genre.If I had one major complaint, it's that controlling with the mouse feels absolutely dreadful. Both axises just refuse to work together, and moving in a diagonal angle is a nightmare. Even Sublevel Zero managed to nail mouse look down to a tee, so I'm not sure what's going on here. Too much focus on joystick maybe?Oh, and the FOV really needs to allow a wider angle than that, 72 just isn't nearly enough.Other than that, amazing job for a prototype."

I have not had this much fun or been challenged so desperately to survive in a very long time. Overload is the next True Six-Degrees of Freedom shooter. Made by the original developers of Decent (the 90's 6-DOF shooter), this new ""Revival"" of their once great gameplay mechanics and intense level designs has made me giddier than a schoolgirl. The demo is well designed and showcases their classic style of movement and solid gunplay in highly revitalized and gorgeous graphical tech. Some people may be skeptical of flying though tightly designed levels with little more to do then destroy, destroy, destroy. Sure, the aged style of gameplay and lack of miscellaneous objectives that will be present will not engage all audiences; However- with that being said, Doom 2016 is the classic style of Doom gunplay and level design that has once again captured the fun and challenge of the original arena style shooters. So it is with Overload. This game will ensare the visual and auditory senses and create a level of suspense and thrill through complex movement, tight gunplay, and well constructed levels that enhance and challenge both the movement and gunplay in a way that is not present in most modern shooters. While I obviously am a sucker for the classics, I feel I can safely say this game will please most audiences looking for a new tight knit shooter. I encourage all reading this review to try the demo and stick with it for an hour to get comfortable with the controls and have a blast in challenge mode. Hope you all will enjoy it as much as I did and thanks for reading my review!"

76561197978352685,Not Recommended,450220,29953966,Posted: 15 February,all,audiographer,"I have high hopes for Overload but right now is seems like the controllers I want to use; mouse or HOTAS, are just a mess.  Everything is overly sensitive, inverting the Y axis for the mouse does not appear to be working, there are no sliders to adjust controllers only some preselected 'steps' that go from Normal (too sensitive to begin with) to very, very sensitive (I am afraid to check those out).  After a while I just gave up as it wasn't worth the effort to fight my flight hardware.  If this problem can be fixed then Overload will be worth another look but until then I will get my Descent fix in Subzero."

I'm just hoping that the full release comes with a mac version! Otherwise, this game is a 10/10 must have 6DOF space shooter. Congrats to the developement team, and thank you a million times. This game looks to be beautiful.~Long live the Pyro~"

I will get this game as soon as possible. I want to preorder, but I am not willing to give my credit card to be billed at a later date! How bout pay pal now! Attempted to sponser but was too late. Great graphics, good game play. I can't wait for the complete game. Bought the ""official"" new Descent, this is much better! Great to have the original people setting this game up."
,Recommended,450220,29451033,Posted: 23 January,all,Retrikaethan,"seems good, however it did not recognize my mouse input at all except for the scroll wheel, which was odd. idk if that's just something specific to my mouse(razer naga hex version 2, btw) or just the teaser being wonky for me for some other reason."
,Recommended,450220,29576879,Posted: 29 January,all,Phork,I can't wait.  My most anticipated game in the last ten years.  I grew up playing the original two Descent games and Parallax software has come back together after all of these years to create overload.  The teaser is GREAT.  I can't wait to see the final product.

76561198095140101,Recommended,450220,29773216,Posted: 7 February,all,Rocelot88,"You know I never thought I would see a game like Descent ever made again. The feeling of flying and shooting from first person. (yes i know there are games like Elite Dangerous etc) Getting disoriented while navigating. The thrill of racing against time to escape every single level. I am getting nostalgic over writing this short review but, this is going to be an awesome shooter and much needed too. All I can say is if you played the first two Descent games, you will be able to hop in this game and you will know the controls from the get go. (I had to turn on the mouse and all that) Any new players to a game like this will have fun. I guarantee it. Watch out for them buzzsaw robots! PREPARE FOR DESCENT!!!"
