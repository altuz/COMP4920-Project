,Recommended,450390,29494682,Posted: 25 January,all,9warbane,An excellent collection of free polished minigames that show VRs potential.They range from calmly playing fetch in real world locations to room scale shmup.It's funny people say Valve should make more games so they do but people refuse to believe in VR.

76561198041775277,Recommended,450390,30013630,Posted: 18 February,all,PancakeAuditor,"There's nothing to dislike here, a collection of mini-VR games that serve as a great introduction to what the Vive can do.  Valve did a smart thing here by setting the bar for what a high-quality VR experience should look like.  This should be everyone's introduction to VR."

It really showcase the power of VR and the potential of what else it can do. I could go on and on, but ill keep it short. This demo is a MUST HAVE and why not? its free! but seriously....PLAY IT! highly recommend it!"
,Recommended,450390,30015537,Posted: 18 February,all,SyITec,Amaziing images and graphics. Interaction was spot on. The bow game is fantastic. I'm hooked. I play this way more than any other game in my collection. I lose track of time with this game.
76561198094178351,Recommended,450390,30162127,Posted: 25 February,all,Tek13,"Very good for getting into VR. I especially like the Bow minigame and the one with the space ship. Slingshot is wierd with bad controlls, don't like that one. Others are cool aswell. Definietly get this, i mean it's free to play, you cant lose anything (except some MB on your HDD)"
,Recommended,450390,29407387,Posted: 21 January,all,Huzzah!,Gotta hand it to Valve for making a great first impression. There's probably no better way to break in your VR set than to jump into The Lab straight after the set up tutorial.
76561198016818097,Recommended,450390,29775645,Posted: 7 February,all,KILLAMANSON,Outstanding!!!!  An excellent collection of mini-games. This VR package is a must if you have an Oculus Rift.

,Recommended,450390,29866370,Posted: 11 February,all,CYB.tachyon,"If you own a Vive, you already have this in your library, and you've just accepted it as a permanent fixture since its inevitably the most comprehensive introduction to VR.If you don't own a Vive, that's probably what you're doing here - downloading it to load up on Oculus or whatever. Welcome to the cool-kids club, bucko."

,Recommended,450390,30231731,Posted: 27 February,all,kavanavak,"As of Feb.2017, this is the best example of what VR has to offer.A great collection of experiences that showcase potential.That said, its a collection of short game examples, not an epic adventure.Archery is a favorite of everyone i've shown it to, I personally think the 360 space arcade shooter is the best experience of the bunch. totally worth trying everything."

76561198136285276,Recommended,450390,29469304,Posted: 24 January,all,AnxiousHeathen,"Longbow and Xortex inside the lab are still two of the most polished games anywhere, and the Lab is free! This should be the very first thing any vive owner tries."
,Recommended,450390,29475206,Posted: 24 January,all,Rowian Nrohna,"forget that it's free, this game was the first game that I downloaded for my Vive when I got it, and it is still being used.This is one of the very VERY few games that are child friendly, so I can leave my son in the Lab, and not be worried that he's seeing anything inappropriate.The different games available inside the lab are fun, and quite entertaining. no games take too long, so this is a good game to let your friends try, and hand the headset off to the next person.Of course, the added touch of GLaDOS appearing is kind of nice too."

,Recommended,450390,29754932,Posted: 6 February,all,Grey Acumen,"About half of the content isn't worth bothering with more than once, however the Slingshot game, the Archery Game, and the Arcade game offer some great and highly polished gameplay experiences that are worth coming back and playing repeatedly.The Lab is the perfect intro to VR with hand controllers. My dad tried a few games on the Oculus DK2. Wasn't impressed. With this, he was impressed."

76561197997794666,Recommended,450390,30118372,Posted: 23 February,all,Tikigod,Awesome VR Title!   Best game to start off with for showing off VR.  Hope more titles come out with this quality.
76561198366364323,Recommended,450390,29966907,Posted: 16 February,all,Olshanski Family VR,"This is a handful of mini-games, and some exploration activities.  There is a good amount of humor.  The standouts are the archery/castle defense game and the spaceship bullet-hell game.  Almost every time the family plays we find new hidden Easter eggs... like a remote-control drone that can be used to shoot at things.  This is a very nice showcase for the VR, and my go-to game for introducing friends and family to VR."

,Recommended,450390,29878103,Posted: 12 February,all,Bow Ties,"Really, your only excuse for not owning this game is that you don't have a compatible VR headset.  This would be well worth a $20 purchase (at least), and yet Valve is giving it to you for free.  Did I mention how especially enjoyable it is for fans of the Portal games?  Just get it!"

Man was I a sucker trying to catch a virtual balloon with my hands in real life!The real life places you can visit, are not that impressive. Quality seems low if you look at the grond. I think VR is not ready for high quality real life places yet.How ever cartoony graphisch are the best. There is a longbow game in The Lab. You start off by walking to the play table and then select your hero and go. Befor I selected my hero I sat down on my knees looking really close at all those details and it looked like it was really there!The Longbow game is like a tower defence, its really good! The Lab is free and it seems to offer more then some paid content on VR!Lets be honest, why would anyone read these comments. Its a free game. Download it for your self instead of reading this stuff!"
