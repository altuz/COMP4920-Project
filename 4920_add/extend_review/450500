76561197971556005,Recommended,450500,32562455,Posted: 19 June,all,Fyren,"On first impressions, I think this is how you do an asset flip correctly.There is no thematic reason for the models to look the way they do - mostly like somewhat low-fidelity realistic fish and battleships - unless they were prebought assets intended as flavor for another game. What they've done is taken those assets, added some mother♥♥♥♥ing lasers, and turned it into a functional but hilarious sea shooter.I mean, it's not a great game on its technical merits; The shooting itself is fiddly and doesn't always feel impactful and the sequence of progression is murky. There's very little clear strategy except that you just kind of throw your units at their units and hope they're bigger, then use genetic material from those units to make something bigger, rinse and repeat. If a mecha combat game or space shooter had mechanics like this it would rightly be panned.But it is a laugh. It's a surreal, eye-crossing laugh, worthy of more giggles than most comedy games in the past year. It is the kind of laugh that can only be had across a cultural gap; the kind Japan provides on a regular basis, as you snipe with salmon, order your school to Engage Reef and Commence Operations, then suddenly come across historical battleships for no goddamn reason.Basically: I would buy it on any sale if you're a fan of having your brain bent by cross-cultural humor.Oh yeah, and the music's actually pretty rockin', too."

Give it at least an hour; it'll reward you.It takes some time to get to the meat of this thing. It's a very japanese affair. The translation is the best kind of bad, but it is bad nonetheless.  The menu controls eschew a lot of common convention. That said, they do work once you get used to them. Conversely, the controls during the actual game are just fine. Most of the confusion comes from the fact that a squad of aquatic laser food is inherently unintuitive.  Once you develop crustacean instincts the controls will click.The squad mechanics are surprisingly elegant. Likewise the AI is better than you might expect. Trust your school.If you're shopping for a squad based, 4X, seafood shooter you could do a lot worse."

So strap on your grouper suit, make ready the eye-lasers that all fish obviously have, and rustle up a gang of fellow finned creatures, such as hermit crabs, jellyfish, and American battleships. Then send your digital possee out across a post-apocalyptic piscine paradise, picking fights with aquatic gangs and taking their territory as your army roster grows from sardines to submarines.This is easily one of the most ridiculous things I've played, but somehow it works. If you liked games like Tokyo Jungle, or you want to try out a sandbox version of Zone of the Enders in which you are a lobster that emits Maccross missile storms, this is not a bad way to spend a couple hours. The controls are jank at first, but you'll adapt quickly. The soundtrack is pure background noise. Front and foremost is the game's central experience: you get to be a magical laser fish. Whether that's to your taste or not will determine whether you like Ace of Seafood."

,Recommended,450500,30429158,Posted: 10 March,all,metalgearrexmgs,"I want to preface this review by stating that I am basing its merits on one hour of gameplay and against the price I purchased the game: $11.99.That being said, Ace of Seafood is a unique experience, but also one that seems shallow and lacking.Let’s hit the good stuff first: you get to play as a variety of sea creatures at your leisure (and as you unlock them), exploring the ocean and taking over reefs on the world map as you go along. There’s a straight-forward tutorial on the various mechanics of the combat that is helpful. The entire presentation is a quirky and really pulls you in when you first fire up the game.So let’s get to the bad: there just isn’t much else to the game. You can find new reefs in a couple of minutes, scout whatever enemy is guarding it, and do your best to win the battle and take over the reef. The reefs are located at various water depths, usually guarded by tougher and larger creatures the deeper they are found. If you die, you re-spawn at your last reef and do it all over again. If you win, you acquire a new reef and possibly breed some new creatures to become or to join your team.But that’s it.Also, the interface and controls could be more fluid. I only played as a crustacean, but found walking can be cumbersome and the camera can be all over that place at times; perhaps the game controls better as a fish. But I’m not going to complain on this too much, as these issues show themselves in gameplay videos, so I expected as much going in.Bottom line: It’s a unique and affordable experience. If this seems like your cup of tea; give it a go. I do plan to play more of the game with time, just my initial impression is that the game could be polished in a lot of different ways. But as it stands, I’m fine with Ace of Seafood being a rough experience: it’s a cheap title, produced by a small foreign team. Just be sure you have realistic expectations before purchasing and you will not be disappointed!"

Conquer a fleet of battleships, and go to war against the giant squid that would oppress your people(?).All this and more.Be the ace of seafood."
,Recommended,450500,28809095,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Shunmasan,It's Fish and Ships.It's exactly like those space ship shooter games except with fish.The game is open world TPS where your goal is to find all hidden waypoints (corals) and beat a boss.Each coral has fish or ships guarding it. Some are too strong early on so you have to look for the weaker ones first.You feel like a gundam when you get the Tuna.The only problem with this game is the bad camera and difficult controls.
,Recommended,450500,24915054,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,Stargatedalek,"I give Ace of Seafood a heartily biased 8/10.TL;DR Not a game for everyone, but if you're a fan of marine life, the Japanese Indie scene, new or unique takes on fighting games, or sci-fi humor that manages to be both subtle and over-the-top at the same time, you'll come to adore it.Ace of Seafood is actually a sequel to another another game, King of Crustaceans, which is a 3D fighting game. Ace of Seafood follows a natural progression from King of Crustaceans into an open world 3D fighting game, which now that I think of it may make it the only game of its kind.There is plot to be found here, but it's told mostly through subtle hints and humorous analogues. The plot is an afterthought to the gameplay (as is usual for fighting games) and its implemented more like easter eggs.The animations are very fluid and well done, and shockingly realistic as with its predecessor. This game could have been made with generic fish all using the same rig just with different stats, or even with generic fictional fish, but instead they are based very faithfully on real species and their movements even though it wasn't necessary. As a biology nerd that scores huge points with me but I understand not everyone will notice or care.Animations aside the graphics do leave something to be desired, but graphics are not something that makes or breaks a game for me unless it looks like it was made for the N64. Ace of Seafood has graphic quality and style similar to PS2 era games which serve it very well. With a good FPS the fluidity of the animations themselves will improve the overall look of the game."

Not everything is balanced and polished (big fish get stuck and are hard to control) but it's great for one dev. Add on the goofy translations and hilarious inpirational quotes and it's a game I won't forget soon.Also music by Deku <3"
76561198103757677,Recommended,450500,31409436,Posted: 27 April,all,Hornbuckle0wns,"This game has made me experience every emotion. I love it. A game for game's sake. A game that all started from, ""I want to make a game where you can fly as a fish"". Wacky, terryfing, inspiring, epic, beautiful, tense. Just a few of the words that describe this game. It's definitely not a normal game, and if you're expecting easy controls, perfect english (especially in the trailer, but his voice more than makes up for it), a plot, logic, a glitchless experience, or regular gaming conventions this is not the game for you. But for me, not having these actually adds incredible charm and having them could ruin the experience. The controls and way the game plays really puts emphasis on teamwork, strategy, and manueverability. You're not pinpoint accurate and the lock on system plain doesnt work on medium to small targets. The ""OK, but not perfect"" english lends a feeling of otherworldliness to those with a strong suspension of disbelief. The main plot states itself in less than a paragraph and is entirely unnecessary, except the stuff after ""The certain thing"" that makes it feel really cool and you just proved the worth of all the new ""Seafood"". Because the plot should only boil down to ""You want take over ocean. Cool stuff happens. Go do it."". Anything else doesnt matter. The foreign logic results in an interesting new world with new rules that are incredibly fun to figure out. Partner-popping (using co-op's auto return to put partner in wall and use him to flank enemy while me and rest of team fight head on, then switching to seige formation and forcing them to split up) and melee-flopping/salmon-skipping (what an actual fish does on land in order to pass the dreaded ""Radio Channel""/ sprint-swimming over small patches of land in order to escape or surprise enemies). The glitches add to the fun and wacky bits of the game. Me and my friend played through the new-ish Co-op mode and couldnt stop playing. The genuine thrill of coming back to a reef that stomped your tailfin the first few times you tried and managing to overcome it is quite good. So many unique experiences in this game. Seal Team Five. The previously mentioned dreaded Radio Channel. BloodBath at the Bottom of Barrier Reef. The dead Whale. The Canadian outpost (Saury!). King Krab Klubhouse. Simba's Pride. The College Campus (TriggerFish Reef). The Abyssal Eye. And of course, Space Fish. The single player gives you a sense of total command with you at the helm, while co-op is more working within a team rather than outside of it. Hard to describe the actual gameplay, really. I think it's supposed to play like a flight sim? The soundtrack's amazing, too. If you want something different or just something really good and involving, pick it up. OOH (Barracuda), Big Da King (King Crab), Big Boy (Cubera Snapper), He (sort of secret thing), Wate (Tuna), and HIGH VOLTAGE (Electric Catfish) are out there protecting the Ocean from enemies like Seafood Platter No. 2. Why aren't you?"

This seems to be just about what the entire game has to offer.-Has one of the worst interfaces I've ever experienced: everything is unnecessarily big, unstylized, nothing is scalable, it has useless elements that serve no purpose in actual combat, text prompts frequently overlap, plus some tutorial tooltips actually have text going clean through their tooltip boxes which, for something you're asking money for, is just embarrassing.-A hint of some sort of cryptic story or lore in loading screens between reefs, overshadowed by a shoddy English translation. Otherwise the game gives you nothing besides ""You're a fish, go shoot lasers out of your mouth."".Runs well, the sounds and music never offended my ears, the controls are intuitive enough. It's actually a pretty cool idea that's executed pretty poorly and makes itself tedious very fast. Like, ""ten minutes and you've pretty much seen it all"" fast."

DO YOU NEED MORE EXPLINATION?!...Fine, I'll go into more detail.The game is mostly about taking over reefs to expand both how many resources you can have, and increase your fish capacity. Once you have all reefs you'll be challanged by enemy schools of fish who will try to take reefs from you.the controls can give you a bit of grief, having no way to go up or down without turning. I'd say this is its biggest shortcoming.Combat is tactical, its best to know exactly what you're going up against and how to approach it. You may want a large number of 'charger' fish, such as salmon, or the bulkier tuna. or you may want to bring a great white along for its massive health pool to tank. not only that, but formation matters too. Should you surround the enemy? keep your allies around yourself? if you don't even know where they are, you might as well go with 'fire at will'.Suitable for wasting a little time, like passing a lunch break, or if your in the mood for something more longterm than the little rouge-lite you normally play.

How could a game where you play as a laser-fish get a positive review? So naturally (with Steams refunding as backup) I gave it a go. Somehow I immediately fell in love with it: it's laser-fish! What seemed stupid at the time became the greatest thing about the game.I kept playing, and the more I played, the more I enjoyed it. Some madman (or woman) has come up with this idea and found the backing to create it (and something this silly that's no small feat!) The effort that has been put into this was amazing, dozens of times as many species to discover, murder with laser-fish-eyes, and become; and an ocean far bigger than I still give it credit for, both in width and depth. (A delightful surprise when I killed a certain squid and entered the reef it guarded!! Still wrapping my mind around that!!)Only problem I have, and the problem is miniscule compared to the many, many good things I have to say, is that the movement could be a lot smoother, with some easier way of moving up and down in the water. Trying to turn to blow up a crab with homing missile laser things and finding that your school has already killed it can get a bit repetitive.(And maybe an expanded upgrade system? Like you don't start with all the weapons you do? Or can unlock new ones? Something like that anyway but don't worry if not, just a tough.)All-in-all, this game was..... IS.... a delightful surprise and I really do reccomend it; it's just the right kind of stupid that everyone can enjoy at some level so big, BIG thumbs up from me.Enjoy :)"

,Not Recommended,450500,29291133,Posted: 15 January,all,Porpoise,"So to start off, I am more than certain that I have the authority to say this game is absolutly awful. In my 7 or so hours of playing I have seen all there is to see, from the god awful ""environment graphics"" to the not-invisible-but-still-invisible walls. I even went as far to get all the achievments to see if they made me feel good about my time spent in the game. And though it was fun for the people that watched me play, it was definitely not fun for me.This game is a painful waste of $12.00 that will give you a little taste of what could have been an great high-speed action game in the same vain of something like Ace Combat but with fish. Too bad it isn't.The game is joke, and if thats all you're looking for then have a blast.Still not as bad asAlpha Zylonthough."

But I played a good hour or two while at a friends house.So what is this game? Well. You start by choosing an animal that represents you. A sardine... A salmon... Or the mighty crab. You go around with your squad of fish, shooting lazers at your enemies and taking over their reefs. When you kill enemies you gain different types of materials that you can use to breed different types of animals for your group. Each type have different stats and weapons, so theres a reason to try out different combinations of creatures.It's a fun silly game. Reminds me a lot of Tokyo Jungle but in the sea. The complaints I do have though is that, since the game is REALLY Japanese. Some of the translations are bad and the controller support isn't great. The performance of the game also seems pretty poor with how basic of a game it is. Other than that. Really fun and simple game."

I personally love the fact that you can actually become things that you origionally feared when you first start playing. Killing Barracudas as a Great White Shark always has a slight satisfaction of revenge. I strongly would advise, however, that this game needs to be updated  a lot. Not that I'm saying ""OH THIS GAME IS BROKEN! DONT GET IT"" Quite the opposite. I'd reccomend getting it now to show the devs of the game you are excited to play this game when it reaches its full potential. Anyways, sorry for those looking for laughs cause that was a bit boring and I know I got a few of my millions of lost brain cells back from actually trying to be somewhat intelligent."

,Recommended,450500,26696519,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,j2thegutz,"Overview:This is a third-person, flight simulator-esq, tactical shooter, with some elements of strategy thrown into the mix. Also you play as laser shooting marine life. The graphics are from the late Playstation 2 era, the controls are a bit wonky, as is the camera, but all of these issues honestly add to the Ace of Seafood experience, it definitely wouldn't feel the same without them.Synopsis:In a world in which humans have vanished, and the sea has swallowed the Earth, the natural tides of conflict never change. You begin your own journey with control over a small crew of fish or crustaceans loyal to your cause. Using your ambition and your courage, you slowly build up your empire, you gain confidence from your victories and begin challenging foes beyond your comprehension, the Lords of Seafood. From minor colonies of hermit crabs, to the lair of the Kraken itself, you liberate the sea, one reef at a time, bringing a new Age of Peace, Freedom, and Happiness to the Sea. You become THE ACE OF SEAFOOD.Conclusion:The game is extremely fun to play, and can easily entertain a player for a few hours. While it has some glaring issues, they often times just add to the experience rather than detract from it. The sense of accomplishment you gain from taking down a great white shark, with nothing more than a squad of sardines is unparallelled. The soundtrack is incredibly good, for no real reason, and it really makes you feel as if you are performing feats that are completely out of your league. The premice is weird, but it's all good fun, I cannot recommend it enough."

Nasty melee powerhouses.- Bluefin tuna are also strong.- A guide recommends clown triggerfish, but I haven't tried them yet.- ...man, this game is weird.The game's easy to get into, offers a variety of sea life with differing weapons and manuveurability for tactical depth, has some intense music, and is great to play in short bursts.  While the AI for certain sea life isn't great (Leopard Seals are the ones that come to mind), that does save you from having to fight them at their full potential, and you can always just control one yourself to bring the terror.  The lock-on can be difficult to work with as well in close quarters, but picking a more agile fish like a salmon or saury or one with a tracking attack like a king crab can go a long way to compensating.This game is really something else.  You'll be busy frantically dodging enemy fire and commanding your squad and gritting your teeth as you aim shot after shot, trying to take the target in your sights down, and then you take a step back and realize you were gritting your teeth as your salmon fired plasma out of its mouth, commanding your spiny lobsters and pufferfish to surround and sat-fire a cubera snapper.  It takes an already ridiculous premise and plays it so straight that it becomes even funnier, and that's just caviar on top of everything else."
