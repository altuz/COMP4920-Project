,Recommended,450540,32888360,Posted: 27 June,all,Baron,"The Baron Reviews:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vL7q4LHwCwOn paper, this game sounds pretty dull; shoot a variety of guns at targets. In reality it is one of the best VR experiences out there, and I think that can largely be attributed to the quality control and attention to detail put into the game by its dev. I don't particularly love guns in real life and I find the idea of owning/shooting gun kind of intimidating, but this has really been enlightening for me as an educational tool. The level of realism for each gun is so high, that after 20ish years of gaming where the majority of games involve guns and shooting of some kind, I was shocked to find that with an M-16 in my hands I had no clue how to actually fire it. All the small things; loading the right clip, flicking the safety, racking the slide, fiddling with the sights and attachments... I absolutely loved it as a learning experience. Plus, the little things, like I didn't know that after loading and racking a pistol, removing the clip still leaves one bullet in the chamber that can be fired. It was therefore surprising to me when I accidentally shot my virtual foot off, thinking the gun was safely unloaded. To me, this is one of those things where even if you are the most liberal, anti-gun person in real life, it's a damn good thing to at least understand how they work from a safety/preparedness point of view!But it's not all educational and serious; In fact, for a game about realistic, lethal weapons, H3VR does an incredible job at not taking itself too seriously! There's tons of fun to be had with all sorts of varying game modes, from straight up target shooting at a range, to swinging out of the ceiling whilst shooting in a jungle gym type arena, to the terrifyingly intense meat grinder mode. As well as being able to spawn items to mess around with without limitation, there is also the ability to reset the environment back to its clean, original state. The variety of guns is large and fantastic, with a huge amount of quality and care in each one. With one exception, they are all true to their real life counterparts, but that one exception is a fictitious gun, the Cleric's pistol from the film Equilibrium (which was a total dream to get to shoot!). There are also some melee weapons to mess around with, as well as throwables and then some straight up silly items.Graphically, the game is so well done. The guns and textures look amazing and some of the best I've seen in VR. The audio too is absolutely top marks, with fantastic attention to detail being placed on little things from the crack of the different calibers to the plink of the bullet casings hitting the floor. Gunfire also takes into consideration environmental reverb, so a rifle shot doesn't sound the same in the gunrange as it does outside. All these small things do such a good job at making the experience feel realistic.The physics are excellent, with the ability to change how physics work from realistic to semi-realistic, or to not at all. I love realistic because I love the ""feel"" of the guns when you toss them on a table, though tossing grenades with realistic physics is a little tricky! I also absolutely love that the option is given to have no bullet casing cleanup, so you can see all the casings pile up on the floor. Other than that, interacting with guns can at times be a little niggly, especially with the Touch controllers, but I mostly chalk that other up to just the nature of doing anything with the motion controllers, plus a recent update helped tremendously with Touch calibration.Because of the mostly standing nature of the game, VR sickness was non-existent for me. You can move around the areas with a teleport, which works perfectly fine. I have no complaints about this game at all, but I do have two disappointments, of which sadly the debates on each have been soundly put to rest! I would have liked to (or the option to) been able to see my hands in game for immersion. However, due to the understandable technical difficulties in this task and potential bugginess it could cause, it isn't going to happen. But even more than that I wish so much that H3VR had a Workshop on Steam where modders could create fictitious guns from sci-fi or movies (like the RoboCop gun, Blade Runner, etc, or maybe even crazy things like a Proton Pack!). However, due to the complexity of adding guns and their physics, the game wouldn't be able to support the architecture for modders, so it is a sound no on that. The absence of these two thing are disappointing in the truest sense of the word, but in no way make the game any less incredible.Even though its Early Access, the current game is polished like a full release. Updates have been consistent and substantial in content, with the dev being active on the forums and engaging with the community. If you love guns, this is a must play game. If you don't love guns, this is a must play game."

As a regular shooter and firearm enthusiast I find the skills carry over perfectly from real life to sim or vice versa. The sim is constantly being updated on the forums by a very active team of devs who are always keen to engage with the community. You could quite easily become proficient at range etiquette, safety and firearm handling in complete safety before ever stepping foot in a real range.If you live in a country like the UK where access to firearms is quite tricky, even after you have your own license it can be a pain travelling distance to often indoor cramped ranges. This offers a fascinating perspective on shooting at home. I personally feel like the experience is on a par with real life shooting when you factor in all the extra expense and hassle of shooting in a country which is not enthused with firearms.The developers also have a sense of humour and fun which is evident in the game design so this would also be great for anyone looking for something a bit different.Posting on my wife's account this is Falandorn from the /r/Vive subreddit and it's been a pleasure watching this simulator develop."

There are some mini-games like grenade skeeball and an arcade shooter, but mostly it's just toying around with firearms at the range. The guns are modeled to be a lot more realistic than your typical shooter. Using the M4 for example requires first attaching a sight, manually loading the clip, pulling back on the handle, and selecting your fire mode. Only then can you shoot.Firing guns in this is surprisingly satisfying. I'm not a firearms enthusiast by any stretch (been to a gun range all of twice in my life). But using these virtual guns for target shooting turned out to be a lot of fun. It even has me thinking of getting an AR-15 stock and building some sort of holder for more realistic rifle shooting.My favorite moment though has been dual wielding MAC-11's. Immensely satisfying."
,Recommended,450540,28153310,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,Soochinator,"This game is a LOT of fun. It's the most accurate weapon handling I've experienced in VR. You literally have to load the magazines/rounds as you would in real life. On most rifles you can use your second hand on the foregrip to help stabilize your shot. You have to screw on the supressors, just like in real life. Magazines are firearm specific, but beyond that you can spawn and mount virtually any optic, suppressor, etc to your weapon of choice.If you've never handled any firearms before, just know that if it's not a revolver, you have to chamber your first round manually by pulling the charging handle (SMGs, carbines, etc), manipulating the bolt (bolt action rifles), or racking the slide (pistols). You also have to manipulate the safety selector switch by pressing left on your firing hand's d-pad. Some firearms only have safe & fire/semi. Others have the addition of burst and/or full auto.There are shooting ranges of different types, a gym course, and more. If you're on the fence, I highly recommend pulling the trigger (no pun intended) on this purchase. It's only going to get better with time. I'm definitely going to be using this game to showcase VR to others with an interest or background in weapons.I have some opportunities for improvement I want to mention.- I'd like to see more weapons in the support category. Maybe the M240B, M249, and AT4.- I'd like to see the M203 or M320 attachment for the M4 available and a function to switch between the grenade launcher and 5.56mm- Add a tutorial/easy mode for the meat grinder game that enables spawning magazines once you find them so you can enjoy the game even if you lack skill.All in all, I'm VERY impressed by this game.

So why should you pay £14.99 for this? Well for starters, this has easily the deepest and most satisfying gun mechanics of any VR game. Everything from shooting to reloading is handled with such care and attention to detail that it provides a truly authentic shooting experience, not to mention the absurdly high quality models for the weapons. You're given a hefty arsenal of guns too, and with the game's delightfully frequent updates, more and more get added to the game all the time.GraphicsThe visuals are basic, no denying that. The environments are just very flat and feel very ""stock"" for a Unity game. Fortunately, the guns are a stark contrast: even holding them right in my face, the models and materials are faultless, which only adds to the authenticity of the gun mechanics.GameplayFrom the outset, there's an impressive amount of content on offer. You're first booted up into a menu of bright red buttons, each one providing their own style of gameplay. I mainly just mess around at the indoor range, trying to get the best score with all manner of weapons. But other highlights are the grenade skeeball (I think I spelt that wrong), arena and of course the breaching level, where you can fufill all your badass action movie fantasies.The developer also includes handy features which work around potential problems that may arise when playing the game. Not got enough room for room-scale? Just teleport everywhere. Need to carry extra ammo/guns? Pop them on your virtual tac-vest. Have you got guns, casings and magazines sprawled across the floor? Just reset the level.But, as expected, the real stars of the show are the guns. If you can do it to the gun in real life, you can do it in-game. How you handle and configure the guns is entirely up to you. I personally find pistols the most fun, you can do all kinds of tricks and skill shots with them while also being a delight to reload. That's not to say longer guns aren't also fun to use. With support for all kinds of attatchments, the ability to grip the gun with both hands and a vast selection of killing machines from shotguns to sniper rifles. Furthermore, if you want. You can fire the guns with one hand, load as many attatchments as you want (for instance: An Acog scope, sniper scope, holo sight and red dot sight all on the same gun).If there is one thing lacking at the time of writing is the absence of supressors (aside from the one found on the M9 pistol). But I'm sure they'll get added in some future update.EDIT - THIS HAS BEEN ADDED. NOW THERE IS NOTHING MISSING.ConclusionOverall, if you have even a passing interest in guns and are lucky enough to own a Vive. This is an essential purchase. Guns have never been so much fun."

I was not expecting much at first knowing Vive games are still in the making but I have to admit this was a good surprise !The game is quite realistic on several aspects, the weapons look real, ammo and items too, aiming is better than in other VR games.There are still things that really need to be improved like magazines reloads, they are a lot harder to switch than in real life because you can't feel them. It's a pain to aim the mag inside the weapon and if you want to do it fast you really have to be careful not damaging your controllers.  In a real situation you don't have to look at the mag and the bottom of your weapon you just grab one and switch, there should be some better automation to get this result.The recoil feeling and depth of sound would benefit a little more work too.Also sometimes the pistol grip of the weapon doesn't match the controller hand position, making it odd to try aiming.However I'm confident the dev will fix all this real fast because this is going to be the reference weapon handling and shooting for VR. This could lead to a new standard for all FPS games as funny as it is now just to play with VR guns and grenades this game is the coolest anti-stress break !PS: Dev please add some bullpup weapon that would be really neat to use for breach missions ;)EDIT:  Devs are doing a great job !!"

Think of it as target practice with mutiple weapons to choose from (All of which have insanely good detail to their real life counterparts) at any given time with a few mini games such as skee ball with hand gernades tossed in. Looking forward to what the developers have in store for this in the near future. Some things I would like to see is a way to scale the weapons in game. Most if not all are not to scale and appear to be on the small side. And while the sound isn't bad, it is not at the level I'd like to see it at.

Its pretty subjective considering the whole game is a glorified demo and mini game collection. this isnt a a statement against H3VR rahter just pointing it out what it is. The minigames are reasonably varied and the range choices are plenty but aside from the amount of guns to choose from, gameplay is pretty basic with target shooting and relatively dumb AI hotdog roll targets. However, the physics on the weapons, damage system of material based objects and detail of everything overall is quite a spectacle including real weapon mechanics employed.

This is a developer who doesn't treat interface like an afterthought, but very carefully considers its role in all aspects of the experience. Using your hands to operate the guns, doing everything from twirling a revolver to popping the lever off a grenade, becomes so natural after a short time that you become *utterly* immersed.

If you are money conscious like me, I'd tell you that this is not for a hardcore gamer as much as it is for someone who wants an outlet for casual (but realistic) gun mechanics and ranges.DevelopmentH3VR is stable and updates and new content are regular.  The developer is experienced and passionate about his work, and I'm very happy to see he smartly weighs development priorities.  The one real caveat—but well within his right—is that he is protective of how H3VR is used.  In recent times, he's been vocal on his limits for H3VR being used as a vehicle for objectionable content in the public space (or used to promote a product without permission).  From my analysis, his interpretation of ""objectionable"" is already in Twitch/Youtube TOS, so it's not anything outside the norm.I'd tell you to sign on to the beta branch because that seems to be the route to go for the ""bleeding edge"" in terms of content.  Don't get too flustered if your favorite gun isn't already in there.  From my observation, the limit is available VR-ready models.  I also think he's got his priorities right making the overall improvements to modes and bugfixes.  As a modeler of 11 years, I can tell you modeling is a time-intensive operation, and that time is better served making the platform for your favorite gun as great as it can possibly be.  I personally have two guns I want in the game, but I'm probably going to end up modeling them myself because there's just so many others that could possibly be added (and PDWs is getting kinda dense).Anton also seems to optimize well because even my R9 390 can handle the top settings and not chug under a metric ton of spawned guns and mags.  Only in the beta branch have I gotten some stutters in one area, but that's why its called the ""beta branch"".Virtual ExperienceWithin the scope of the game (not VR in general), I'd tell you that it's almost fully convincing.  I like how well thought out the use of the controllers are in terms of replicating the feel of manipulating an actual firearm.  It's clearly optimized for the Vive because some of the actions using the thumbsticks take a little practice.  You really want to consider a third of fourth camera.  That's smart in general, but also because the best locomotion is ""Arm swinging mode"", and in that mode, you can move (but not turn) by swinging your arms around.I can sit down and just putz around in H3VR for 4-5hr intervals.  It's not lacking in engagement into the environment.How I use ItPersonally, I use it like I would use a range in real life.  I've kinda given it more purpose than a casual sim.  Where I would normally spend $20-50+ on a range trip to get some serious practice in (I'm licensed to carry and keep my skills sharp), I can just fire up H3VR and do the same and more (hurray full auto, suppressors, and metal targets).  I by no means attempt to be some Gun-fu master or whatever, but I do want to make sure I have the muscle memory to react in seconds like I would in a real incident.  H3VR saves me money, and it may even save someone's life one day if I (god forbid) have to defend my/others/bystanders/etc lives.Also, Anton's weekly devblogs brighten my week, so there's that too..."

Seeing that this is still only early access, and the dev is very active and responsive to user feedback, this will be more than worth the cost by the time it comes out.Do NOT expect zombies or anything like that - but do expect to be able to augment your real life gun practice with some simulated VR training. The gun models and handling will be good enough that you can actually use it for various types of training as far as pistols goes. Rifles are very hard to simulate with two independently moving controllers, so until someone decides to produce and sell proper controller adapters that let you place the controllers into a rigid rifle like body, it will not be very realistic (I've made a PVC rifle mock up, it helps but it is still not quite there).75 % of the VR ""games"" out on steam by the time of writing this is nothing but tech demos, and hardly worth half the asking price - H3VR however is worth every cent.So cough up your hard earned cash and support a really good dev who is working on a great product that helps show off one of the many uses of VR.Here is a gameplay video of the Early Access Week #5 build:https://youtu.be/F3WFdLio3N8"

,Recommended,450540,22574673,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,nsamok6620,"This game is good; I have a lot of fun playing it. The ""holster"" function is great and I appreciate the ability to make the ammo unlimited. The diversity of the weapons is good (a full size shotgun would be nice though) and the ergonomics of the controls is pretty good as well (dropping the mag on the standard pistol sometimes goes funny though)But it could be better. My problem with the game lies with the reloading. In the virtual world you can't feel when the magazine is lined up with the magazine well, and this results in frustration while trying to get the dang thing in before the targets disappear. There is another game that just has shotguns and I can reload them without even looking during the quick-draw mode because the shell and the tube have a sort of ""magnetism"" so if it is close it will go in. Additionally, the player doesn’t even need to be holding the shell for it to load. This is not the case in this game. In this game I have even dropped the shell into the shotgun, it would slide into place, and then just jiggle around, still considered to be unloaded. A fun mini-game that I started to do in the other game is to toss the shell into the air and see if I can catch it in the shotgun. That obviously wouldn’t work here. Lastly it isn't as big of a deal as I thought it was since I found out you can use both hands to close the shotgun/grenade launcher, but the one handed move to close them usually results in my flailing my hand around for a few seconds before it registers.So in short, I am pleased with this game, but I feel it would be better if the magazines aligned themselves once they are close (by a couple degrees and millimetres I’d say) and if there was something that allows the shells to fall into place in the barrels. Oh and speed-loaders for the revolvers. I don’t even load them one at a time when I’m at the range.I look forward to playing the game in the future and I hope the developers add some new levels and guns. This is exactly the kind of game I looked forward to playing when I pre-ordered my Vive."

It is very rare for me to type up a review for a game, but this one most definitely deserves an absolutely good, honest review. The developer is one the most devoted developers out there. I submitted a question asking if this game is able to work on the Oculus Rift (BTW yes it does), and the developer got back with me within an hour of asking the question. Another example is when I asked a question on the H3VR Reddit page, regular people were not the first ones to reply to my question, the developer was the first, and even answered that about an hour after I posted that. That support is a very rare thing to see with the games and developers now. The graphics are really good, and after a while, it feels like I am actually in the game. The game runs very smooth on my PC (I7 6700 processor with a GTX 970 4GB graphics card), and that is with a high quality preset. This is a very relaxing game too when you are just shooting in some ranges.SO TO SUM ALL OF THIS UP:YES GET THIS GAME!!! $20.00 is a great price, and honestly, I'd buy this for $60.00 over any AAA title because of the support and great devs that keep this game going with the great updates and all.

Full gameplay is unknown as this in an early access game. I don't think the dev has a planned feature set and is just kind of developing the sandbox as he goes. Likely a bad sign if you want a complete game but I was willing to risk it for $20. This is less of a problem for a sandbox as it is more likely to be a collection of features anyway. The dev seems to be listening to and interacting with the player base for feedback on where things should go. I have actually spent the most VR time in this game. It is a lot of fun to check out all the guns and handfull of explosives that are currently in implemented. As far as I can tell everything is high detail and offers fairly realistic interactions.You can load single bullets into the guns and all mags keep track of ammo count. A bullet must be chambered to fire and weapons have a safety if they do in RL. The angles of grips match that of the weapon's real life counter part although I don't know how well this works with the vive having a much different grip than most firearms. Currently there are mostly pistols but there is also 3 shotguns, 3 smgs, the M4, and a granade launcher. Most of the pistols are semi-auto but there is a revolver as well. A recent update added speed loaders which is nice as it can be kind of slow to load each round by hand.There is a system to hold equipment on your person like a chest harness which is very handy. The menu on / triggered by the trackpad lets you teleport as well as pick stuff up from a distance. This lets you get stuff from across the room without teleporting or just lets you get something you dropped and you are too lazy to bend down. It might actually be my favorate feature. I'm playing the game in a space that is a bit too small to count as room scale but enough space to swing my arms around. It still plays fine. The dev has stated that he does not want to label the game as standing. I assume this can change in the future but currently works well for my setup thanks to the tools on the menu."

The game even allows the user to load bullets into magazines manually, some magazines have holes in them to reveal how many bullets are left inside (just like real life!). Everything down to the slider lock/release mechanics have been taken into account. For example, say you pick up a Colt 1911 pistol, pull the slider back, and then press the slider lock/release button (which does exist on the actual gun), the slider will stay locked back, then load a magazine, once you release the slider lock, a bullet will be chambered and ready to fire!This kind of attention to detail is deserving of respect. Things I would like to see in future updates, or even DLC, are scoped and bi/tri-pod mountable weapons, realistic bullet travel speed and arcing, and some form of improved travel mechanic (as opposed to having to teleport), and maybe some more lively mini-games.Keep up the good work Rust LTD! - MrSauce"

H3VR isn't so much a game as a collection of experiences and experiments with realistic weapons in VR environments. The mechanics can be a little twitchy but theres a lot of iteraction and reaction to feedback so things are always moving in the right direction. Since launch there have been weekly updates and video logs discussing the latest changes and where the project will be heading in the future. Incredibly impressive project and absolutely unique as a VR experience right now, well worth picking up!Things to definitely keep in mind - There's no in-game tutorial, it relies on out of game videos, community and knowledge of real firearms to some degree. As above some of the mechanics can be flaky or take some getting used to.If you find one of the mechanics just doesn't work for you, start a discussion and there's a good chance it'll be adjusted in a future patch!"

I am not a gun expert but will say the realism for me is very good, hearing what the dev talks about in terms of ballistics and physical properties of the targets it certainly seems that he has done his research and can convert that info into gameplay.There are a number of play types from ranges which offer different experiences, laying prone in the sniper range, or sending your target down the standard type range to a distance you set then see how close you can get to the centre. There is more with breache n clear areas but these are still under developement but work well enough to try out.Loading weapons, setting fire rate or turning off safety, pulling back to chamber cartridges is all well done especially dropping the empty and quickly shunting the new one home which gives that authentic feel and makes non VR shooters a little empty to go back to.So far it has been one of the best Early Access games I have tried as the Dev is really active and the game gets updates with fixes and addditional content every week, along with a vlog discussing the update and a general how things are going chat.Buy it you will seriously have fun.""Wonderful"""

If I could I would buy this over and over again.Anton Hand is a great developer, with weekly updates and videos on youtube, listening to his crowd and applying improvements, bug fixes, new weaponry and new scenes.Gun mechanics are sublime and can be simplified for people having trouble handling them. I've yet to find major glitches, most of them are physics related but what would you expect when there are 50 mags spread all over and shells flying everywhere. And even if there are glitches, the dev fixed it before I could even find it.Pros:- awesome gun play- graphics and detail on the weapons are great- weekly updates with new weapons or attachments almost everytime- innovative in my bookCons:- movement (as always on VR) does take some getting used to- if you want realism the gun mechanics can be hard to operate (physics issue, can be simplified so not really a complaint)- the movement with motion controllers can be somewhat annoying at times, such as hitting each other when trying to reload or not able to attach an attachment on the gunOverall, the best VR gunsim there is and -with the enormous amount of dedication of the dev with weekly improvements- probably will ever be.9.5/10"

,Recommended,450540,28813285,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Blinxis,"I wouldn't usually review a game that's early access, but this one was too awesome to pass up.Easy on Hardware- Usually a game of this scale and detail would absolutely annihilate my computer. The minimum specifications state that I should have a GTX 970 (currently running a 770, with every other minimum system requirement matching or barely exceeding). I can safely assume that the difference is minor, and has very little impact on the games performance. This is not to say that a 760 would perform just as well, but I figured that my system could set the system requirement at a lower bar. I played again today for the first time in 2 weeks to stress test the rig, and I found it to have a very smooth framerate. When I initially purchased the game a few months ago, the game was very jumpy on some modules. However, as of today I can easily tell that the developers have been working extremely hard to optimize the game even further.Realism- This is important for me. The very first thing I did after I installed the game was to pick up an M4 and go through the paces of loading it up, charging it, and eventually firing it. However, I was not expecting to actually have to use a safety switch in a VR game. That's when I knew that attention to detail was the games primary focus. Granted I DID buy H3 blind, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. I set the gun down and picked up a grenade. Like the biased approach that I had, I just threw the damn thing. Nothing. Turned out the pin actually had to be pulled. Well I'm an idiot. To me it was like opening a 10K piece set of legos, and being told ""Go forth and prosper.""Replayability- H3 is a sandbox game mixed in with various levels of weaponry and processed meat. Sure you can use all the weapons, and throw all the explosives currently available, but then your creative juices will start flowing and trickshots and speed runs will eventually ensue. After spending 20+ hours in the game between multiple accounts, I always seem to find something new to do and test out.Dev Updates- The amount of updates that get pumped into H3 are astronomical. Yes I am writing this review when it's still early access, and I know it could potentially slow down as the months progress. It's not necessarily the amount of updates that makes this an important category for the review. It's the developers focus on what should be updated for the game. For example, I've seen many cases where other game developers will push multiple updates through the week that have new additions for the game, but completely neglect the known bugs or other playability issues. This is not the case for H3. It's a nice steady mix of additions and fixes that allow the players to continually explore new things, while re-playing existing content with fresh fixes. Not only does the developer update the game, he (Anton) also loves to push video updates on youtube to show the H3 community what's new, what's been updated, and what's on his mind for the future of the game.Player Support- What I've found out recently is the amount of support that the team gives towards the games community. I've seen and experienced a lot of interaction between the dev team and the community. Which is absolutely fantastic. After chatting with a member of the team regarding a suggestion, I was informed that the team highly encourages community feedback. That's what early access is all about. Becoming involved with the game, and providing feedback to the team to make the game as successful as possible.(Thanks Luke for your time!)Difficulty- One thing that threw me off was how diverse the weapons are. I love to shoot, and have shot A LOT of weapons over the past few years, but I found quite a few weapons in game that took me a bit of time to learn how to operate. For players or future players that haven't fired a weapon before, don't fret. The game isn't a ""stump the dummy"" kind of game. It's more of a learning opportunity than anything else. In a many cases, once you learn a type of weapon, you've actually learned the mechanics of a few others.(TL;DR) Final verdict- Overall, purchasing Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades was well worth it. I couldn't really think of a con or complaint for the review. Sure others will have differing opinions with the game, but the overall attention to detail stood out for me, and really highlighted the potential for a successful future full release."

,Recommended,450540,26368191,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,Cyrix,"I'll give H3 a weak recommendation. There are a lot of cool features and ideas here, but packaged in a clumsy way. It's obvious that the developers are very good at simulator mechanics but are clueless about UX and have no idea how to make somethingfun.H3 is basically a gun simulator with some shooting ranges and a handful of poorly designed game modes. The gun simulation mechanics are very solid - the guns look awesome, the interactivity with them (mostly) feels right, and shooting them and reloading them is fun. If you're into guns you'll probably get hours of enjoyment just out of plinking targets at the simulated shooting ranges.After adding the first few shooting ranges, the devs began experimenting with actual gameplay modes. These are all still in development but unfortunately tend to be brought down by issues more fundemental than just being a work in progress.The first mode to add enemies who move around and shoot back at you was the arena. The arena has some large, ugly robots known as clunks that navigate around slowly and fire long volleys of slow-moving bullets. Instead of having a body hitbox and HP, the clunks have some red switches that you are supposed to shoot. If you manage to hit all of the switches before any of them reset, the clunk blows up. The design flaw here is immediately obvious: the switches are tiny and extremely hard to hit, and since the clunk fires long bursts at you, you have to spend most of your time ducking behind cover and hardly ever have time to take careful aim at one of the switches. This requires way too much precision, is too demanding, and isn't fun at all.Then they added a variant that has a whole-body hitbox instead of the switches. Sounds great, right? Except that it has so much health you'll be dumping mag after mag into it before it finally kicks the bucket. You'll end up spending several minutes on one enemy, unless you bring drum magazines and laser sights.Then they added a new mode for Halloween called the ""meat grinder"". In this mode, you explore a seemingly endless maze of copy-pasted hallways and 3 kinds of traps looking for a few pieces of torso to bring back to the start point which you'll be hard-pressed to find again. There is a new robot enemy here, a tall and narrow one that has spikes instead of guns. There are a ton of pieces to blast off of this robot, and all of the magazines you find in this mode start with less than full ammo, so you'll probably go through all your ammo to destroy one robot. Another mode that is poorly designed and not much fun to play.In a year or two there might be a really solid game mode here, but for now you can expect solid shooting simulation and some game modes that only tease you with the idea of fun that is kept just out of reach."

I understand its a sandbox game, but even still, it has very little replayablility. It NEEDS more on-rails experiences like the Halloween update Meat Grinder, which at this point, is one of my favorite parts of the game. The ranges and things should be a small portion of the package, not 3/4 of the entirety.Overall, it is an amazing game, and i recommend it for anyone with VR.

,Recommended,450540,33253243,Posted: 4 July,all,[TPZ] Cereal Killer,"About The Game:Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades is a Virtual Reality experience for both the HTC Vive & the Oculus Rift. A Firearms simulator at heart but not what I would consider a game.... YET! Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades has only just gotten an update that has just started turning it into an actual game.If you go into Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades expecting a full on VR game then you will be slightly disappointed, however if you go into it expecting a Simulator or an Experience then you will be a very happy chappy.The game is developed by a very dedicated & loyal developer that always puts the content and the community above the income. He's never released an update that I've been disappointed with to date.The Review:Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades is a very fluent, realistic, very detailed, lovingly crafted simulator. The firearms are modelled to their real life counterparts, the sounds are authentic to the real life counter parts & most importantly the FPS is solid smooth all the time. (Something that you should always expect from a Virtual Reality product.)The controls work great, the firearms are modelled exceptionally well & each moving part flows smoothly with the animations. There's a lot of different movement options, graphical settings for weaker computers & plenty of gameplay modifiers to change the experience from realistic to playful. (If you choose.)There's a large number of game modes in the game currently from Sandbox target shooting maps to indoor & out door rifle ranges, night ranges, etc. There's also a small number of actual game modes with moving targets and tagets that shoot back.Currently the closest thing to an actually game experience is Meat Grinder & WurstWurld with targets that actually fight back & other little mini games to play. There's just so much content on offer here & it is getting better, I've sunk (currently) 100 hours and still haven't had enough of this experience.The Verdict:The Bad:Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades while a fantastic VR experience isn't without its problems. There's bugs here & there & there's sometimes some bad physics but overall the worst thing about the game is that it does lack some actual game modes, things with enemies that fight back. Currently WurstWurld is slowly making progress towards that but it's still a little lacking.Lacking actual game modes.Buggy physics (at times).Occasional game mechanic failures which prevent further play without a map reset.The Good:While Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades has its problems it also does a lot of good, I mentioned a lot of them throughout my review but I'll also add them here for those who would like me to just get to the point.A fanatastic & realistic sandbox Firearm experience from the comfort of your home. (And for those of us who don't have the money to spend on ammo all the time).Realistic & beautifully crafted weapon models that really are something to oogle.Realistic bullet drop & physics.Exceptionally fluent & well animated models.A constant 60+ FPS Virtual Reality experience.Plenty of customizability from graphical settings to gameplay modifiers.Lots of different Firearms to play with from Semi-Automatics to Bolt Actions to Lever Actions & of course Full Auto's.Constant and consistant updates that add more content. (Even if only small).This VR experience in my honest opinion is that it's aMUST BUYif you have an Oculus or a HTC Vive youSHOULDhave this game.Conclusion:My final verdict from Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades is a solid 8/10.It just needs a lot more actual game modes to make this a 10."

And immediatly shot my self in my virtual head, followed by my virtual foot, then I unintentionally ejected the clip and dropped the gun.At this point I'm almost doubled over laughing at myself.It's virtual so just go with it, first few days with this I was simply laughing and whooping.A recommened activity is to just embrace your grouchy internal redneck, sit down in my high back office chair.Load up the desert range, and shoot shotguns and magnums, and when I miss all the bottles throw some dynamite at them,Honestly imo best title for the vive right here, almost worth the entire device on it's own."

,Recommended,450540,26054592,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,Barinzaya,"Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades is by far the Vive title that I have spent the most time in so far. It's very solid mechanically with an impressive attention to detail. H3 already has a large variety of different firearms and a constant flow of updates, adding new weapons, new features, and occasionally new ranges.The mechanics of the guns are very robust, and not easy to master. If you know how guns work, then things will most likely work just as you would expect them to. If you don't, then you'll spend some time figuring it out before you're able to shoot things. It's not as simple as load and shoot for most guns, and there are no in-game tutorials (yet). Most guns operate on similar principles, though, so once you figure out the general principles, it's just a matter of figuring out how they apply to each different gun.This is a firearm sandbox more than anything else--there isn't really a whole lot to do in terms of guided gameplay. Out of all of the gameplay areas so far, only a few of them (the arcade proto, the arena, the breaching proto, the Gunasium, and arguably the modular arena) actually have anything resembling an objective, and none of them are very lengthy. Those aren't what keep me coming back to it, though, for the most part; I consistently return to try out the new firearms and features that are frequently being added, and I occasionally jump in just to shoot for a bit, even when there's nothing new.H3 is perfect for someone who has an interest in guns, but doesn't own one. If you want focused gameplay with mechanics simple enough to get you up and going quickly, this probably isn't the game for you. But if the idea of a game that gives you a bunch of realistically-simulated guns and leaves you to your own devices appeals to you, then give it a try."

But seeing that the dev puts out weekly and very thorough dev reports I decided to support him in what I thought was a game with a lot of potential.  Turns out it's doesn't just have potential, it's already great and polished.It's also very realistic. Well, hand grande skee ball and Lazer wands aren't based in reality but the guns sure are.  Magazines don't magically slide into the gun when they are in proximity.  You've got to put it in there yourself.  No auto reloading.  You have to release the mag, insert another, and chamber a round.  And that process is true to the firearm you're working with, meaning the VR gun operates the same as it's actual reality counterpart.  Very cool, if not a tad frustrating when trying to operate a firearm you're not familiar with.There's no in-game tutorial.  Just like actual reality, you've got to figure out how things work on your own or you have to go to YouTube for assistance.  There is a bit of a learning curve but I think that's perfect for this type of experience.This is now my go-to title for casual time killing in VR.  But there are also not-so-casual parts to the game if you're looking for a challenging race-the-clock, or wave shooter experience.

You have guns you can load and fire, loads of attachments for said guns, there's targets, mini-tanks and hot-dogs to shoot. Go bananas!The game focuses around the handling and usage of guns, explosives, different types of ammunition, melee weapons and objects with a heavy emphasis on physics and realism to a certain extent. There isn't a whole lot of maps where you can do loads of things, and the game never tells you what to do, so the big joy that I feel most people will get is the sensation of picking up a shotgun, reloading(terminator style, baby!) and shooting, throwing grenades, aiming and firing a sniper-rifle, all in a very realistic manner! The fun is in the gun-handling and the creativity that comes from messing around with them!The controls arevery confusing at first glance, and may be unintuitive for some. The developer, Anton Hand, does however explain incredibly well in his youtube videos how to use your controls, quick-belt slots, which guns can do what and all that jazz to its full extent, so definitely check those out if you want a full look through how the game functions and what you can do! His Youtube is just called ""Anton Hand"", and he does a devlog video every friday to explain what he is working on and why some things will or will not make it into the game. Healthy for gamers and game developers alike!Alongside what I just wrote in the paragraph above, Anton updates the game every other week(used to be every week, but was changed recently) to fill in what he's working on for the game! He's very active with the community, takes in feedback from the players and experiments a lot with ways of making the game comfortable for as many as possible! Speaking of which, thelocomotionin this game is very customizable and easy to get a grip on! You can change the style of movement(joypad-like moving, teleportation, click-to-walk-to-that-location, etc.), how fast you are, sneak speed, among lots of other options to adjust!Beyond that, there's not much else to discuss without explaining everything the game has to offer! So on that note, I'll give you the innevitableTL;DR!This game, in my book, is bloody fantastic! It's fun, rewarding for those who learn, open for loads of customization, very clear and frequent contact between the developer and players, constant flow of updates(again, every other friday), and just the sheer joy of picking up and using guns istheexperience! Out of all the VR games I've played(which includes most of the popular ones), I always find myself going back to this game to pick up the M1911, Desert Eagle, M4A1 or bolt-action sniper to fire at some hot dog robots, target plates fired from the ""PULL!!"" cannon, or lay down in the sniper-range to take down some far-away watermelons with a massive anti-material rifle!

To some, the latter may seem off-putting, 'early access games never get finished',  'early access games are buggy and deter me from playing the final product', 'early access games are a cash grab' etc etc etc. If there was ever an exception to any and all of these common complaints, H3VR was the game to break this particular zeitgeist.Watching this game grow with Anton's regular video updates week by week, and playing the updates fortnight by fortnight, has not only changed my option on the early access model, but also completely justified my own decision to invest in a HMD. The constant attention to and interaction with the H3VR subreddit is a testament to the quality of this title, with community suggestions being added to the latest build of the game mere hours before updates/ bug fixes are pushed to Steam.The meat of the game is playing with firearms, and fighting robits. The level of detail put into each weapon is what really sets this titles apart from the rest. That said, the controls are a little more complicated than most other VR games, but I have found this to part of the fun while demoing the game to friends. 'Why can't I fire this frig-  -BANG-  Ah.' However, if you watch the weekly updates, Anton does a fantastic job of explaining the controls and new mechanics (which change regularly).Overall, if you own a Vive, H3VR is a must buy in my option.

The growth is not only new guns to play with, but also new maps and modes. You can really tell that Anton loves working on this game. He puts up weekly Devlogs on his youtube channel to give the community the knowledge of what is changing or being added. The game has slown down to bi-weekly updates at this point, but Anton is working on the bigger parts of the game. When the game first released there were wekkly updates of smaller things. If there is any ever big issues Anton has always made an quick fix and released it in a hotfix, these typically are released the day that the problem is found.

There are practice ranges with TONS of options, mini-games, and more.If you like gun, like shooting things, or just like having fun - this should be the first Vive game you purchase."

Had it not been for the most emphatic recommendation of a person I trust, I wouldn't even have looked at it. The goofy XMas-themed video that ran in the steam store also did its best to scare me off.So I bit the bullet (ooh, pun!) and purchased this title.Now, this game goes against *everything* I stand for and yet I still love it. Since I left the military 30 years ago, I haven't touched a real firearm, and I advocate strict gun control. This game is fun with guns and everything that goes bang. I should hate it, but I don't. It allows me to play with guns yet without experiencing any guilt - and it is brillianty implemented. Now, aiming sidearms one-handed feels very different (and is strangely difficult) from what I was used to, but maybe that's because it was so long ago. This is sheer fun, and the implementation of a sandbox firing range is pure genius (I just spend two hours straight at the 'friendly range'). Plus, this is one of the few room-scale only titles that really makes sense.Oh, and heed the developer's advice to check your staps when using grenades..."

Every shooter game for VR should have mechanics like this game has. Anton (The developer) is a hard working man. He deserves the praise for what he has made. This game was one of the reasons I decided to buy a Vive.Basically a shooting gallery. Nothing to really do but shoot some awesome weapons, and reloading them like in real life.I'm sure Anton will come up with loads of different gamemodes and the like.

If a handgun/rifle controller with good haptic and forcefeed existed, we could get rid of real guns and I wouldn't care.  Range time without the ill health effects would be great.  Having virtual range time is something great and really shows how VR can be use to do things you couldn't safely do in real life.  I hope the updates keep coming and the community continues to support the dev.Late Oct updates:  The latest updates make the game a lot easier to get into.  I'm already seeing a lot of potential in the arena especially with the slicer robots.  They can get pretty scary and I'm looking forward to the AI behavior getting better.

I will admit there is some awkwardness in this though, reloading can be amusing for others to watch you as you fail to put a clip in a gun or that different guns can have different controls.

There are challenge modes with leaderboards, if you're into that. Now the quotes aren't a bad thing. I love H3VR. Doing dumb tricks, going crazy with the attachments, just throwing stuff.It's a bit hard to even put into words why it's so much fun. If you own a Rift + touch or Vive, you should definitely buy this! What if you're not into guns? Well, I'm not either, but it's still oddly cathartic and fun! You can take it as seriously or silly as you want!For all you front facing touch/rift users, fear not for there is now a facing teleport option. No need to worry about losing tracking anymore! It's buried in the locomotion options anymore, I believe in the sub-menu for the teleport option.The devs are amazing as well! Definitely check out the devlogs on youtube.Overall, I highly recommend it! $20 is more than a fair price for the amount of content and love put into this, in my opinion. Very polished VR experience."

So immersive I was actually jerking in anticipation of recoil (bad habit I know).Bugs found: controls for Modular Range placed outside play area. Attempts to reach upper keys resulted in me placing my fist through my 72"" TV (not literally mind you). I feel the range controls should be placed further back inside play area.Wants: The ability to give the middle finger to freshly demolished targets. Oh and zombie targets :D.Note to the uninformed from a real shooter and those that say otherwise: This will not improve overall skills. This will not teach you how to shoot a real gun and even if you do figure it out through this game, this will not teach you how to deal with recoil, proper handling of a firearm, posture, etc. Thought I'd mention this in case someone got misinformed or is having delusions :). Yes, I've actually heard a big Streamer who was not a real shooter actually say you could learn how to shoot a real gun which is why I say this. At the MOST, you can learn basic operation of a firearm (like loading a magazine, revolver, charging the firearm, safety, and a basic idea on how to aim down a sight.)."

A developer that keeps in communication with his customers and listens to advice and ideas is a good developer in my book and should be supported, especially more so with VR because its so new.H3 itself is a `work of art` in firearms handling. Right now there is nothing in VR or probably anywhere else where you can boot up on your PC and start handling guns just like you would in the real world. Safety, charging, swapping out magazines or changing fire modes are all well intergrated into the VR controllers- in my case Touch from Oculus. The array of shooting ranges, arenas and other `mini` type games are a blast.If you're considering picking up H3, do it. If you have never picked up a gun in real life and are intrigued by their operation or you're experienced in firearms handling- there is sure to be something for you in H3 and I wholeheartedly recommend it."

Or trying to put scope attatchments on.Shooting range minigames add a layer to this. Manual reloads are entertainingly clumsy with motion controlers, but once you get the hang of it it feels like a racing speed run challenge, trying to beat my own speed.I'm not a gun nut and I've only been to a gun range once, but this the closest I've gotten to that experience.

Enjoying the sound of the birds, the sunny blue sky, the sound of soda cans whizzing across the grass after being hit.-Practicing at the indoor range with a wide range of lovingly replicated firearms, trying to beat your own best score, clip after clip, going into a meditative state as you perform the ritual manual task of tapping the scoreboard for another round, releasing the magazine, slotting in a new one, pulling the slide, bracing your grip, looking down the sights.This is guns-as-zen, a meditative experience as much about handling, reloading, and examining these guns as it is about shooting them.

The developer is very invovled and does release constant updates, so I hope in the future I can say it is worth it.  It is a very cool game to demo for others if you are looking for something like that, but It won't keep you coming back after you've run through each demo area a few times.  Its also kind of dissapointing the developer has stated he has no plans and will not make this game multiplayer.  It doesn't have to be a FPS multiplayer shooter, but a 2 palyer shooting gallery would be amazing in this game."

It looks great, there are cool guns with real mechanics but thats pretty much it. We only have 1 pistol and 1 rifle, all the other stuff isn't that much fun to play with. Sure, there is some realism becasue of the guns but for $20 I would have expected a whole lot more. I cannot reccomend this game at this price to anyone. I am a huge proponet for VR and loved every single game I have bought and played so far with exception to this one.The target practic is dull, the different shooting ranges all feel the same, only 2 guns to mess around with with excpetion of a grenade launcher and some grenades and dynamite. Lacking too much content. I see that it says early access so maybe there is a chance they add enough to make it worth it, otherwise they are going to have to lower this price. Maybe if they add a few more pistols, few more rifles, maybe a rocket launcher, at least 15-20 more items are needed to make it feel worth 20.  At this point I wouldn't pay more than 5-10 bucks for it. Also need to improve the target practice stuff and make better game modes. I have the utmost appreciation for the dev of this game and all VR devs out there but I feel like writing a review like this will do a service to people since there are so few of us out there. I'm not saying this is a bad game or to not support it but rather that it is just over priced.EDIT: 5/27After owning the game for a couple months I have decided to add to the review and edit my stance. This game is a lot more polished than some of the other stuff I have played in VR. it is in early access and I should have taken that into account more. That being said I still think there is not much to do, not many game modes yet but the most important thing to me is the Dev is working his♥♥♥♥♥off on this game bringing new stuff every week. The guns look great and if you treat this game as just a little gun shooting range simulator you should walk away satisfied. I think there is still a long way to go to make this a full game but just had to revise my review after playing some really crappy games made by some really lazy devs, you can see that in H3 these guys are putting in a lot of effort to make it a good game and worth the price so changing my reccomendation to yes.

I love the gun mechanics in VR, the reloading, aiming, shooting, etc. It's always really fun, but I couldn't enjoy this game. It is what it says it is, a sandbox like shooting range. There is a wide range of guns and constant updates, so I can see why the game has such good ratings. I personally got tired of it extremely quickly. The mechanics were a bit clunky for me to thoroughly enjoy the experience. H3VR just loses it's appeal rather quickly for a $20 title, but I feel bad not recommending it, because I can see how others may still enjoy it."

I have followed the dev logs for some time and think it's great what he is doing. He is only one guy, though.Technically speaking, the gun models in this game are great, similar to Zombie Trainer. It all fell apart for me (and this is common thing with VR games) in the menu structure. I am prone to motion sickness with locomotion and wanted to switch to point and move multiple times, only to be redirected to the menu. This may seem small but when you just want to put on your headset once in a while and play, it's hard to enjoy when it seems the UI is working against itself. There are too many steps you have to go through in the menus to get to where you want to be, especially if you need to change things often (like moving about).Again, it's great to see what this dev is doing and tons of respect for taking this on as a solo dev, but for me it's just not worth the money to when so much of trying to get to the good stuff is muddied in trying to not be frsutrated by the menus. I will come back to this in a few months and continue to follow the process and would love to suggest some UI changes (I'm a web/graphic designer)."

Aiming through the sights of the weapons can also be somewhat problematic if you're the type to tilt your head, since that causes the sight picture to blur a bit. There's not really any other way to do it, though.Overall: An interesting idea, to be sure, but certainly not worth the price. Perhaps if they made reloading weapons easier and more natural. Maybe they'll fix things before the game is fully released."

You can go to a real range and have an hour of fun with the real thing assuming that you live in the states and the dev's messiah hasn't banned firearms yet.The controls are a bit confusing and inconsistent at times.  While I did have fun in the gun gymnasium map, it quickly got repetitive and it was awkward enough that I didn't really feel like doing it multiple times in an effort to compete with friends for best times.  Additionally, the first 2 friends who tried playing that map had no idea what to do since there is no tutorial and no hinting in-game.The physics in the grenade ski-ball map leave much to be desired.  It confused a few folks played the game while over as guests, and confused me until I learned how to let the grenade cook before rolling it... again, no tutorial or on-screen guidance.The game may eventually become polished enough to warrant a $20, but it just isn't there yet.  Couple this with the fact that the dev just pulled Oculus support in political protest to Palmer Luckey's supporting of the GOP candidate, I do not have much confidence that the developer has the interests of his customers in mind."

It's definitely what it advertises and the gun models are great, but I just feel like there could be a lot more to it. I know that it's early access and the devs add to it all the time, but at the moment I don't feel like there's much of a reason to play it lots. Sure, there are a lot of stages to use the guns - but I want to shoot something that moves. I know there's an arena mode - and I tried it out, but at the time of writing (20/08/2016), it's stated as ""VERY WIP"" and you can tell. There's a strange tank thing you can shoot but I shot it and not much happened except it shot back and killed me.However, I acknowledge that the problems I have with the game are ones that I could have realised before I bought it had I researched it a bit better, so I won't give it a bad review because for what it is, it's great.

Prior to getting my vive around Christmas, I had been eyeing this game for several months. After my initial list of games I purchased this one a little after the MEATS update was released and have loved every minute of it since. It is nearly my most played VR game (audio shield slightly wins right. Ow because my wife and guests play that in addition to myself).I originally only wanted a VR shooting range, but this game does so much more (in addition to the VR shooting range). MeatGrinder is a huge thrill and a ton of fun. MEATS offers a huge variety of ways to shoot. The indoor range and friendly 45 are my favorite ranges (I love the ""trap shooting"" on friendly45 even though I can only hit the pots. The most recent WURSTWORLD update is just incredible and is the real reason I'm writing this review.I normally try and get 1hour/$ in my video game purchases, but WURSTWORLD itself feels like an entire game. With ~16 hours at the time of writing, I feel like I've totally gotten my money's worth and extra. Anton, the dev, clearly puts so much work, thought, and love into this game. The physics are amazing, the game looks great and ran perfectly on my 980 before I upgraded, and the variety of guns and ammo is just astounding. I'm not even entirely sure I've used every firearm yet because there are just so many and Anton is continuously adding more.If I had to say one bad thing about this game, it's that you really need to watch Anton's dev logs in order to figure a lot of things out as the current in-game directions are lacking. However, Anton has mentioned this is something he is working on.This is a sandbox game, so don't expect a story line (although WURSTWORLD has a better storyline than a lot of other games I've played), but this is the definitive firearm simulation game for VR.

Attatch scopes to weapons that allow. Laser sights, flashlight, red dot sights.  This is a premium game for VR due to its attention to detail.  Take me, a guy who only has gun knowledge from video games, and think the game might suck.  This game pulled me in with it's varitey of weapons.  There are shooting ranges, target practice games, and even math puzzles.  20 years from now when VR has reached its peak or somewhat near everyone will look back on the games that pushed what VR was meant to be.  Gorn, Space Pirate Trainer, and Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades.  The original.  If you own a headset you owe it to yourself to try it.  If you don't like it then fine, refund it.

This is hands down one of the best Early Access VR Games you could buy right now. So much tender love and care has been put into every little nook and cranny of the guns you can use that it brings a tear to my Patriotic striken eye. (And I'm not even American!) The developer - Anton - is so dedicated to this project and so happy to work on it with bi-weekly updates with new content, bug fixes and as so heavily active in the community that he should be a Role Model for how you develop and run an Early Acess title.Enough sucking the developers♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lets get into the meat of it. (eheheh... meat... puns...)Pros:- Multiple scenes for you to explore, play in and test weapons in the game alongside a few very fun objective based maps with interactables. Such as AI spawning, target practice (With multiple settings and variations to play.)- Over a hundred guns to play with. And as advertised, each is accurately modelled and functions like the real life counterpart. (Sparing for some VR limitations, you still require the touchpad for some interactions, most of it is using your own two hands!- Constant and active developer updates and developer himself. You'll get any answer you need from the H3VR reddit, where updates are posted with changelogs. You won't miss a thing and keep up with the memes!- Slow to fast paced gameplay. Fancy shooting up some bots and running about? Or you just wanna load up an AK-47 or two and see how many times you can hit the broad side of a barn? Hell yeah you can! Your imagination is the limit - scenes provide you with plenty of visual stimulus to keep you entertained. And just exploring how the guns work and looking at their models is a load of fun!- Weapon wackiness. Wanna put 13 red dot sights on your Mk-18, 3 sniper scopes and 9 laser dots? You might crash your game. But you can do it!- Meat.- Just buy it already.Cons:- It's still a WIP.- Wait, Mister! Thats a con? Yes! It is, the game is still being made. There are unfinished features of the game that are on the list to be developed on, so your favourite section might not be updated for a long time.- There will be no Kollibri.- Antons couch.- There aren't really many cons.

With that being said, this is an amazing VR Shooter experience, and a decent investment for the price asked.The fact that the three H's are underplayed, or at least overrated, is a tad misleading, but ultimately makes for an interesting viral marketing campaign.  Seeing that the game is still in Early Access, there is still plenty of room to grow into that titular promise, especially seeing that the lawn games, 100 weapon count, and grilling simulator features are essentially missing.  I will amend that they are not COMPLETELY missing: the WurstWorld level exclusively contains a horseshoe course, the weapon count is a few dozen strong, and there are jets of fire and killer robots disguised as hot dogs over in the Meat Grinder level.There is a fairly modest, yet growing, range of weapons currently available in the game, along with a healthy amount of attachments to go with them.  The attention to detail with respect to the physics and handling of the firearms makes them highly realistic, essentially turning your playspace into your own personal shooting range.  I, personally, am a Wild West nut, so being able to fan the hammer on a Single Action Army or spin load a Winchester over at WurstWorld are phenomenal.  If you don't know what I mean by that, then come on over and see for yourself, Pilgrim.There are two big drawbacks that I do have to complain about, though.  First, my tracked controllers never seem to register when I first enter/start the game.  I have to turn them off and on again in order to get them to work, despite running the game through the SteamVR client.  This problem was about 60/40 before Update 44, but now, with that Update, the problem has appeared each and every time I have launched the game since.  It is annoying and inconvenient, but not game-breaking.  Second, the 'Meat Grinder' level is, to me, a winding and confusing maze with no cohesive way to navigate it nor complete its challenges within the 30-minute time limit.  I'm not sure if there is a map or context clues to determine ""where the beef is"", but trying to locate these rooms otherwise, while being distracted with all of the gun/ammo caches (that I may or may not even need), could easily take hours.If I could suggest some room for improvement (besides the controller glitch), I would recommend developing an online-ready experience.  On many of the shooting range levels (especially the sniper courses), a Co-op/multiplayer lobby with binoculars or similar optics equipment could really intensify the shooter's experience when their buddies are guiding and cheering them on.  Likewise, a way to 'share' or 'trade' saved weapon loadouts in between Friends can be mutually beneficial and fun by further reducing weapon build times.  This comes especially handy for 'handing down' your favorite rifle to the excited greenhorn on his first day at the range."

Figuring out how to load the gun and getting it ready for fire brings me such joy. The bolt action rifles are one of my favorites to fire- it's so satisfying to pull the boat back and watch the shell eject and slam it back in for another shot.The game has a few modes availible- some are a work in progress , while others are finished. Traditional indoor ranges, Sniper ranges, a mini-game like range that tests your aim, reflexes, and speed. It's all in good fun- From my time of purchase until now- I believe there have been two or three updates and the developer doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon which is always a plus.The biggest issue that I've run into and is not the games fault, but VR's...is that looking down the sights to distant targets can get blurry due to the resolution.

This works extremely well on 2 sensor set up and i have had an extremely enjoyable time, putting hours into the nerve wracking, spine tingling hell that is the Meat Grinder mode.The gun play is some of the best of all VR games i have played and there are constant new additions and variety to play with.I would really like to see a crossbow and gyroscopic bow added to the game pretty soon! especially add one of those to Meat Grinder so you perhaps start with one bolt but can reclaim it, unlike bullets."
