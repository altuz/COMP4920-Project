It reminds me of Re-Volt.Though there are not really that much cars and tracks, and after 2,5 hours of gameplay I've almost finished the career mode. Also, the AI is really easy to beat, so i expect to get the most fun out of online multiplayerThe problem with the game is the price. Although I do not regret buying it, a lot of people might not buy it and online players will be scarce.If the devs make it possible to play online against console players, I expect there to be much more players.So, please devs, make cross-platform possible!"

It is a $10 or less game.It is a solid table top non serious acarde racer, but just not that fun or challenging. In under three hours I am almost half way through the game.The maps are not even very imaginative. There is no real feel to the different driving serfaces or maps.The game modes are pretty much all the same or things we have seen in every other game like this before.I have seen this table top theme done so much better over the years. This one is just pretty but without substance even for a game that is arcade style it lacks being fun.OH And Release day paid for DLC needs to be banned.This is getting to be the norm for many companys and in this case they have removed access to several car's in game to charge players who have already purchased the game if they want to access the full game.EDIT:I have just received a message in the comments section of my review.

Among the highlights are interests, where you ought to exhaustingly seek after down a much faster vehicle and a short time later mallet into the back of it. There's also transfer races, where the deplorable racer got in last place is constrained to go home toward the end of each lap. These race sorts may not be anything we haven't played through some time as of late, but instead in any case they make for different rapid and fun redirections.These race sorts are part into two essential classes; titles and unprecedented events. Titles fundamentally make up the beguilement's calling mode and are done up with a fabulous prix style rivalry where you'll fight for your spot on the stage. Extraordinary events differentiate as they are standalone challenges where you are depended with using a particular vehicle as a piece of demand to share. The titles particularly race to exhaust themselves as small is hurled in on the way to mix up the experience.A strong part of the things that you'll uncover over the track are disappointingly dull. In spite of the way that they disregard to have a ton of an impact on races, this is in all probability by diagram given the reasonably short length of the tracks: anything too much effective would overpower. In actuality, the stop column is truly satisfying to use, as you're prepared to change your foes into a square of ice and look as they slide over the table top. Regardless, other than that, even typical speed underpins don't feel like a beneficial get, as they're simply prepared to give your scaled down scale evaluated motor with a slight mixture of speed.Apparently the preoccupation is splendid and component, and its five essential set pieces are expertly composed with their own particular exceptional obstacles for you to move around. Evidently the rise of the five is an eighties stirred lair, which is improved with vinyl records, squares of Lego, and dusty old trading cards. While these set pieces feel stimulated and have their own specific identity, they quickly feel depleted as they are too vivaciously relied on. In the midst of the later periods of the calling for instance, these tracks are exorbitantly reused with simply slight assortments to build the inconvenience.In the wake of tearing your way through events you'll be repaid with a whole of coins that is dependant on your finishing position. Your merited cash can then be given on new automobiles and upgrades in the parking space. Part into three levels, each available auto is impeccably arranged and they keep running from Breaking Bad persuaded RV's to souped-up diversions cars. The essential issue is that once these redesigns are executed, races get the chance to be extremely basic, as limiting racers fight to equal your actually pimped out ride.The nonattendance of neighborhood multiplayer is a dreary overhaul that assembling to play with colleagues is everything aside from a diminishing memory. This is bewildering as relative titles, for instance, Mario Kart and Micro Machines are as often as possible recollected on tenderly due to their thought of disengaged forceful modes. There is the decision to play online with up to eight players, yet matches are much of the time quickly soured, as players will stop mid-delight in view of their disappointments.The Supercharger DLC Pack concurred with the dispatch of the principal redirection and joins the development of new cars, maps and titles. While the new parts do overhaul the general experience of the beguilement, there is no making tracks in an opposite direction from the slant that they should have been consolidated it from the onset and that it was simply partitioned off to monetise the redirection encourage while it's free for such an expansive number of through PS Plus. We wouldn't see any issues with paying for it under these particular conditions, however having this as paid substance when the beguilement dispatches on PC and Xbox One (and when it's a standard release on PS4) wouldn't feel right. The new title events in like manner feel truly pointless, essentially mirroring every opposition you would have played so far and incorporating alongside no in the strategy for assortment.Table Top Racing: World Tour looked set to take after the well known path designed by its exceptionally standard versatile predecessor, yet rather it fails to make the stage in light of different in the motor issues. The nonattendance of neighborhood multiplayer, some stifled pick-ups, and the foreordained number of settings are just few of the blemishes that keep this fight racer from remaining mindful of the resistance. It's adrenaline-fuelled gameplay may feel empowering the underlying few times around the track, yet tragically it's temporary as a result of a nonattendance of assortment in the midst of the races.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

You should get about 16 hours out of this if you play though the championship + challenges and a bit of Multiplayer.Would recommend this game to anyone who likes arcade racing in the same style as Micro Machines, mainly if it's on sale.11/10 - That soundtrack!"
,Recommended,450670,23224282,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,Ian,"A brilliant and fun racing game, easily comparable to micromachines with a bit of penny racers thrown in. Lots of game modes and tracks to choose from and the multiplayer is really fun too. Art style is really nice and the cars look and sound great, fair amount of cars to choose from and different weapons. Well worth the purchase!Just to add more info, There's 3 types of cars to choose from, classics, street racers and supercars, each has 3 trophys to win using each of the 3 types of cars. Each type has 4 cars to pick from, so 12 cars in total. (Unless you buy the DLC then there's 4 more) Each car handles differently and has stats to upgrade, speed, acceleration handling and armour so the more races you win the more money you get and the better you can build your car. Each car can be equiped with 7 types of wheel and there are 4 different paint jobs for each car. There are 126 challenges in the game with 3 stars to get in each (gold silver bronze) for a total of 378 stars. Game types inclide Combat where you have weapons to blow up other cars, elimination where a car gets eliminated each lap, pursuit where you start 1 lap behind another car and have to catch up to it, drift where you drift, hot lap which is 3 lap time trials and fastest lap game types. There are 5 different enviroments to choose from and 4 different tracks in each enviroment. Online is upto 8 players and you can customise if you want power ups on and off etc.I think it's worth the money and really fun, the small details make this game. The art style is really nice and on the best settings it runs 144fps so the frame rate isn't capped."

The actual race courses are small and not very interesting besides the ""table top"" gimmick. That's some novelty at first, but not a lot of fun is had with it. The driving lacked a lot of feel and excitement a racing game usually has, and the tracks are very flat except for an occasional jump, incline or decline. Sure, it's racing on a table top, but I really think the racing and track design could be done better. Maybe those are reasons why table top racing games tend to disappoint. I think some day someone will finally get it right, but this game still isn't it.I got the game with the first DLC only to end up feeling like the game did not create enough interest to keep me coming back.The multiplayer lobby here is a good place to watch tumbleweeds from.Some people like the ""breakbeat"" dance soundtrack.

Positives are the driving physics are well done, the style is superb, the music is great (reminds me of the Dub Pistols which is nice) and there's no shortage to do, and it keeps things fresh with diffrent modes.Negitives are some things aren't clear (Why would I bother with buying armor), you kinda need the drift tires if you actually want to slide, which is exaggerated by the fact handbrakes are missing, and while the wheel options are a nice nod, they're mostly tolken outside of Drifts, Bling, and Bounce (Which you'll never use in an actual race.  You'll only use it to go back and pick up the coin collectables),Overall it's a solid experience that's lacking in some finishing touches (But seriously who forgot to put in a handbrake?)"

,Not Recommended,450670,24744871,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,Paperwell,"This is one of those I LOVE THIS GAME but I wouldn't reccomend it reviews.Here's why:1. Almost no one is ever online, which sucks, because when there was, there was a lot of customization you could have in every game. EX. Set track, Set cars (or only one kind of car), set all or select rims (like drift rims, bouncy rims) and my personal favorite NO UPGRADE option, because you know, you can upgrade your cars or have them race like 50CC in mario kart. But overall, having no one online to ENJOY these features takes a major draw out of the game for me.2. Following number one, the tracks are well done, music is kind of....well decent(?). But the problem is that I can only enjoy the same variety of tracks so many times because of the gameplay mechanics.3. Following number three, Gameplay mechanics are really simple, which in most cases are great! But it feels really lackluster here, it just feels almost....uncomplete.SO IN SHORT STORY MODE:No one is  playing online, it has great variety in ways to play the game but lacks overall gameplay mechanics to keep it interesting in single player mode, the music is somewhat of a turn off and the tracks get redundant. THERE""S JUST SO MUCH TO BE WANTED. Give me a car shunting system instead of just simply ramming the car and falling off with them and I would think the game is great for the whole ""TABLETOP"" experience.....Oh man....that wasn't really short story was it....?

,Not Recommended,450670,23341118,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Jet Uppercut,"Table Top Racing is a very aptly named game, because you race around on various sorts of tabletop surfaces. I'm not sure about the World Tour part, though I did see an American Flag in one level and a Union Jack in another, which I guess are flags corresponding to different parts of the world. Four out of five words is pretty good for a title.Now I couldn't really make my mind up on whether I liked this game or not. I spent an extra five or so hours more than I feel this game deserved trying to decide. The graphics seem to lend to an illusion of this game being much better than it really is, at least for me as someone who enjoys racing games quite a bit. The flaws to the game and total lack of documentation on certain game features lend to my depreciating opinion on the game.I know a lot of people will compare this to similar games on Steam like Toybox Turbos or Super Toy Cars and I'd definitely put this on a similar quality level. The graphics are much better but the gameplay lets it down a fair bit.The handling model is incredibly simple and doesn't interact at all with the physics. If your car is acting under physics, whether you hit an object, got rammed or just landed after a jump, you have no control over your car until that stops. You have very mild 'air control' which is the same level of control you have while on the ground. This means the most powerful weapon in the game is ramming someone from the inside on a corner and makes the handling feel very inconsistent. Not to mention, the physics system itself isn't perfect by any means after landing from certain jumps or even little bumps in the track I've had my car rocket in total random directions. The very simple handling model and poor physics implementation means the meat of the game, the actual driving, is very hit and miss. I could forgive it if the game didn't force jumps on every track but every long race I was just constantly in fear of the next jump destroying my chances of coming 1st.The AI doesn't offer much challenge either, none of them take any shortcuts, they all follow one racing line and drive at set speeds and only ever fire their weapons at you. This means the best events become the Time Trials, Hot Laps and Drift Events since all of the Combat Race style Events are braindead easy provided the physics don't screw you over.This in itself wouldn't be a bad thing either, but there's no Single Race mode, you can't pick any of the tracks you've raced on, pick a mode and some settings and have some fun. You have to race on their preset events, whether they're in the Championships or Special Events. There might be a track you really want to drift on with your favorite car, but unfortunately you're not able to.They're working on local multi-player, so perhaps this could come in a future update, but as of writing this review, this feature's not in the game.There's also a lot of undocumented features. Lots of weapons in the game counter a weapon and are countered by another. Like bombs attracting Heatseeking Missiles or the Electricity blowing up the Bombs. Some of the pink glowing things on the side of the track are Shortcuts which can be opened by hitting them with a Level 2 powerup, the things that aren't shortcuts usually toss some debris on the track. There's a boost start you can use at the start of the race somehow which was recently added in an update. There's also a lot of little things on the tracks you wouldn't be able to find out without making a serious effort to. Like the orange GO! Sushi signs on the Sushi shop track actually being little doors you can drive through. Or the Circular Saw on the Workbench track actually hiding a shortcut you can take. I understand some of these things are meant to be 'secrets' but if you have some shortcuts highlighted and others not it doesn't really make sense. It's just confusingly inconsistent for no real reason. The level 2 weapons are also locked at the beginning of the game for some reason so you don't even really know they exist, which means things like shortcuts are unavailable to you as well.Now the Drift Mode for the game, even though I've been decidedly negative about it this whole review, I found to be quite enjoyable. The DLC also adds an AE86 that's 'Legendary' for drifting, so I spent a good amount of time sliding around in the few available drift events I could use that car in. I'd personally say it's the best part of the game even if it's limited. There's also another great undocumented 'feature' in that a lower handling rating makes a car drift better. Especially useful on cars with lower drift ratings and high handling ratings like the Supercars.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game just because I hate the way the physics are handled. For a casual racing game player, once you start racing on the more difficult tracks I could see the difficulty spiking way up, especially with all the hidden things that aren't really common sense. For someone more experienced, the game won't challenge anything except your patience with the poor physics. A little more effort and it could have been a brilliant game."

I felt immediately like I'd played it before with a different skin on it.  Now, a game like Re-Volt which is 15 years old now, does everything that's going on here and doesn't feel generic about it.

The reason I say V4 is because the 3D aspect is very similar to V4 and not like any of the other Micro Machines games leading up to that point.I love the open environments and the enclosed spaces at the same time. I love the fact you can upgrade your car from the start and still have money left over, that is if you choose the basic starter car kit.One thing I will say that I don't like is that sometimes the controls can be a bit stiff and at others times it makes you as clumsy and wobbly as a car on ice. In order for me to really enjoy the controls I will have to learn to get the right balance. Whilst playing this for the first time I slipped into a lot of hazards and lost vital rewards due to the controls. I wouldn't say that the controls are bad but when you take Micro Machines V4 the controls were solid. At least more solid than this game, in my opinion, but I digress.Anyway I think that if you can work with the controls then I reckon you'll have a blast. I mean I don't want to make the controls the reason you don't pick up this game. I can look past that, but it was just an experience I noticed when I played for the first time.Anyhow I suggest you give it a go. The tracks are nice and light as well as realistic and the gameplay is intriguing, desptie the fact it's similar to Micro Machines V4.All in all, a great game! Worth the pickup!"

It reminds me of Roadtrip: The Arcade Edition aka Gadget Racers. Although, getting the DLC makes the game a bit easier because the cars come pre unlocked and are fairly high tier for their class.

And that's pretty much why I bought it. My kids are at that age where they like video games but the only ones they can play with any skill are games with simple controls like racers. So I picked this one up on a recent sale and it seems like it's a lot of fun. It's not a very complex racer, utilizing only a few buttons on a standard Xbox 360 controller, which is a plus for younger children. Most of the cars seem to handle the same and while this may turn off mature race fans I doubt most kids and more casual racers  will mind. One thing that stood out to me right away was that the pysics are a little wierd; instead of feeling like your car is moving the game feels like the car is stationary and everything else (background/track, other cars) is moving around it. Anyone who's ever played an old SNES ""Mode 7"" game like F-Zero will know what I mean. But this isn't a bad thing, it's just something that takes a second or two to get used to. The cars are all pretty cool looking but have limited visual customizations which is sort of a minus for younger players who love to change their cars looks. One nice thing is that most of the cars can be fully upgraded with limited amounts of effort which will give younger gamers a real sense of accomplishment.As far as everything else like graphics and music/sound goes it's servicable; nothing special but nothing deal breaking either. All in all If you can get this at the $10 range (I paid about $7 for the game and the DLC) and you have younger race fans this is one of the better Kart Racers out there and I reccomend it."

,Recommended,450670,23770883,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Kalsonic,"Fun quirky little game, with a bit more emphasis on 'little'.Content-wise, it's relatively sparse. There's little to no background story for each car and track. I wish the devs expanded this a bit further each track and rival that bit more special. A few extra lines of text helps a long way.There's not that many track variety, and what track it has is dynamically limited to simple doodad physics. I was hoping for course-changing events (think Split/Second's PowerPlay) with animations that would incite shock and awe. Sure, it has doodads everywhere on the track affected by physics, but it just doesn't have that much of an awe factor, just cuteness. Oh, and more secret areas in tracks please, like RC Racer from the Playstation.Finally, there's the racing element. I know it's suppose to be an arcade racing game, but personally I think this level of arcadeness can be dull really quickly. I wish that there's more gamified/cartoonified elements of real-world racing in the game here. Some examples I could think of are:- quick tire wear (loss of grip after 5 or so laps, maybe have a 20-lap endurance race?)- quick fuel consumption (in the same line of thought with tire-wear, varies with each car)- component damage (too much crashing into others, damage to overall performance)- track rules (not sure how this can be implemented, but a quirky full-course yellow and a stop-n-go penalty would be amusing)- pit stops (complements the tire wear and fuel consumption)Mind you, I'm mostly a sim racer when it comes to a car race. I'm not asking for this game to be a sim, I just wish that it has some elements of a sim, but make those elements exagerrated and quirky, especially when you consider the vibe that this gme is giving out.There's a sale as of this review, so... eh, I'm enjoying it.Forgot to mention: music selection is dope. Needs moar.More stuff I forgot to mention: the aesthetics, I like it, a lot. Think of Road Trip Adventures from PS1. The cute, chibified cars are back and they're so adorable! Also, I like the resolution choices and how it still remains full-screen. What I'm getting here is that low-end PCs (like laptops) can play this game at reasonable frame-rates."

The gameplay is not bad. The game runs good and it is fun overall however i feel the gameplay is to similar all the time. After 10 races i was kind of done with it. There is not a good indicator that shows when u are in the last lap etc. This game is fun but not for a hour a day. Im about to refund it just because of this. Overall i had a great time in those 35 mins i played it."

I will say that it seems to be a multiplayer focused game and the singleplayer aspects of it are fairly easy and not very expansive. It's still great fun, though. I haven't done any multiplayer yet and I'm enjoying it just fine, making money to buy and try new cars and upgrades.""Fully tune-able"" is stretching it a bit, though. You can generically increase your car's top speed, handling, acceleration and armor, and you can buy a few sets of tires that have various (but mostly minor) effects, also paint that's purely cosmetic but that's the extent of ""fully tune-able"". You can't upgrade engine, exhaust or suspension parts which, to me, is what ""fully tune-able"" means.$20 well spent, in my opinion, and if you buy it buy the bundle. The DLC that would otherwise costs $6 only costs one penny in the bundle and it is worth having."

I almost purchased micro machines world tour until reasearching and reading reviews.   I ended up getting this game and toybox turbos.. both on sale and the total is a fraction of what micro machines would have been.  The graphics on this game impressed me.. and it runs smooth on my first gen i7 (1.6ghz-2.8ghz) and old amd 4650 graphics card.   This is the more serious of the racer of the two... toybox turbos is more like micro mahines in my opinion, with it's more topdown racing style.   I'm very pleased with the controls (I use xbox one controller) and simplicity of it all.  If you are unsure of the new micro machines.. do yourself a favor and get this game and toybox turbos while they are on sale... and forget the machines!"

The soundtrack makes this game even more fun. The environments that you race in are fascinating and really reminded me of the old RC racing game Re-Volt. I believe this game was inspired by Re-Volt. The power-ups on this game make it even more interesting and I like how it feels like the older PC game Blur. Don't be discouraged if you lose the first few races, it takes some effort to win and that's why the upgrade system is there for after you earn your hard-earned coins.Only thing this game lacks are Steam Trading Cards.I'd definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of power-up racing games."

,Not Recommended,450670,25375788,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,BurnoutGT45,"Table Top Racing: World Tour is a kart racer with a Micro Machines aesthetic. Unfortunately, it's not an entirely memorable one. It's obvious the devs were trying to make something special here, with the admittedly pretty visuals (probably the best thing about the game) and the exotic locations, but after a while everything starts to blur together.+The small car list is at least made up of vehicles that handle quite differently from one another.~Some decent environment variety that sadly gets recycled quite a bit through the single player~Weapon wheels give some sort of pre-race strategy, but not enough IMO.~Music is okay at first, but you'll want to mute it pretty quickly. (In my experience, Forza Horizon music is a great replacement.)-The game doesn't penalize you at all for using the Boing weapon wheels to jump over entire sections of the race track(s), which makes the game a cakewalk if you get those wheels too early.-Multiplayer has been dead since day one, so don't bother if you're looking for a solid online experience.As a single player kart racer, it's quite competent with some decent weapons-based racing to be had. Take a look past the gorgeous exterior though, and the hollow interior shows itself. It's an average racer in search of a heart that other games have.Recommendation:If the above doesn't bother you, get it at a steep discount on sale. Otherwise, there are other games that do what this one was trying to do, but much better. If you want a great 90s style arcade racer, try Toybox Turbos or Redout. If you want a kart racer, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is still the best on Steam. And if you end up playing this anyway, whatever you do, DON'T buy the DLC. Each DLC makes the game worse in different ways."
