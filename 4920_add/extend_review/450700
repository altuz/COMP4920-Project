To returning fans, you will find that the game has significantly more breadth (in terms of content)  and depth (in terms of customisation).However, many of the core features are yet to be implemented (such as character progression and ship building) and there are definetely a few flaws. If you're a picky person and would like a polished game instead, wait till testings are over!"

For those who are hesitant about buying an early acces game, I can tell you tat I've got 17 hours played and the game is totally functional, addictive and fun to play. Lots of options, I'm not even in the 40%. Still has some bugs, but overall, I recommend it 100%. Also, it's beautiful aesthetically."

To reach its appropriate audience, its price point is a bit shy for what it offers.  So they dont want to make money on this one.  That is fine with me as long as thier haert is into it; and it is.I sure do miss gaming in 1998-2005.  That was where gaming engines, features, and mechanics were not rinse and repeat.  Every game felt brand new.  This title is sorely under appriciated in a most undeserved way.  You really dont want to miss out on this one if you have the slighltest like for this genre."

There are still many aspects  that need to be improved though it already has a nice amount of contents, but the developers are very dedicated to this game and very responsive to players.Pros- good amounts of contents in the game already- can change rooms colors. if you don't like the candy atmosphere in the game screenshot, you are free to create your own station in dull color.- base-building and base defense. Unlike Space Colony, enemies will attack you indoor in this game.- very dedicated developers. They released the prequel but dissatisfied with it, so they spent their resource to rework the whole game again.Cons- station invaders are more like meteor falls than a type of enemy, they spawn and destroy every objects around them, then get killed immediately.They should have more characteristics like wandering in player station and do some villain things like hurting people and robbing food, medicine. This way it will create some interesting story for player.- mono-colored UI, it's hard to distinguish between [build] and [destroy] icons when they have the same color and looks very similar.- planet traveling mechanic seem quite confusing, I hope there will be more easier way to assign people to a planet- this game feel too quiet, there are only few sound effects presented in the game. It's like my people live in a silent world.REQUESTS- more hairstyles for female human that won't make them look like an old lady (Yep, I want more attractive chic in the game!)- more soundtrack in different styles with the current ones in the game(some music from piano or guitar would be nice)- Xenomorph-like creatures infest player's station, please watch Aliens franchise and you will get the idea. I want to see my station get infested with some cool monsters.My personal base-building game ranks1. Prison Architect, Rimworld, This War of Mine2.  Clockwork Empires, The Spatials: Galactology, Factorio, Craft the world3. Stonehearth(great game nice soundtrack, but villagers are not quite complicated) , Dungeons 2, Sheltered4.

I love where it is going. I enjoy supporting and following early access games and I'm sure that this one is destined for great things. That said, it is early access and buggy. The game is incomplete, but the creators have provided cheat options to help players experience aspects of the game that certain undeveloped areas could limit access to. I have experienced crashes and random disappearances and reappearances of officers, but these things are to be expected at this point in development.To put it simply, if you want to see this grow, get it. It's already fun despite its lack of completion and I have faith that it will only become more entertaining in time. However, as with every other early access title, if you lack patience for bugs and continual updates, throw this on your wishlist and grab it when it's finished."

76561198025200773,Recommended,450700,28499604,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,Ningasak,"The Spatials: Galactology is a real time base simulator. You start with a small crew of 'redshirts' and a dream for a profitable space economy. Its current build is in the alpha stage which means that the tutorials are a little clunky and hard to follow. However, this is a real gem of an experience. It reminds me of a less frustrating and less boring version of Evil Genius. Your base is constantly doing stuff, a little space ant farm, while you can travel to various planets for resources.The planets are procedurally created and they don't have a huge variety at this junction, but the maps are pretty and serve the purpose of giving your troops something to explore and capture. Each planet has various resources, such as metals from the lava worlds, which must be extracted with a universal building (the old version had more variety but I don't think it needs it.) As your tech tree increases you can put in recruitment centers and tv stations to run ads for your station.The controls on the planet are a little wonky right now. The units tend to just walk around and get eaten unless you set them to hostile, then they shoot up everything in sight. The game really starts to shine at the edge of the experience it has to offer. You can build upgraded ships into a fleet. Your units can equip various neat little lasers, shields, healing beams, and the crowd controlling gun 'the medusa' which doesn't cause damage but it does stun all the enemies. Soon your crew will go from monster chow, to genocidal death troopers.The code base was swapped and the original game, The Spatials also included various missions and planets that were bases full of troops. Which I assume will be coming back, these further the experience and give a chance for the various planets to give outside quests for neat toys or rare resources.Right now, the game hits a wall where you get a production tool called the 'cheatomatic' which produces all the strange and odd resources like booze and poker chips. You can continue to upgrade to higher tier ships and weapons so this isn't a deal breaker. I does make managing resources a little bit more micro-management than I would like.Resources are handled like a game of dwarves, or Gnomaria. You set up a general storage area, but you can place pallets near machines and set those to specific resources. This will allow you little space person to do less walking around. Which at first appears to be the primary purpose for spatials, carrying boxes from one place to another. The game does give you a job grid that lets you control what kinds of jobs the various troops will do. It also has robots that you can build. After I play for about 30 minutes usually all the carrying stuff is handled by helper robots.Troops can learn various jobs which follow the star trek model, security units, scientists, engineers, and diplomats, with each one sporting the correct color T-shirt. They get experience for doing the job, so if you want security personal give them a laser, set them to aggressive and drop them on monster covered planets. Just check on them and use a neat feature available on planets the 'teleporter' to drop your future killing machine down wind of a herd of monsters. Then watch as they all run towards the laser.Science is handled with various techs, that don't follow a tree as much as a tech path. For example, you can research all kinds of tiers of guns’ levels 1-15, 16-30 but the tech must be unlocked sequentially. As it currently plays research will run out after about 5-6 hours of science officers working three research tables. The tech is just researched, so then comes manufacturing.Manufacturing is handled from different machines. Soap comes from a chemical tower machine that also makes batteries.  To make soap you will need oil. Which comes from planets. The starting system by default has access to all the basic materials. After placing down extractors and setting your fleet to auto pilot retrieval of stored stocks, your units will have access to the materials. They will then follow the orders you give each device. There currently is no way to prioritize jobs, however you can set owner ship of an object and limit that owners job duties. For example, I can make my redshirt produce infinite soap. Which is super important, if your troops needs are unmet, they start smashing up the place and eventually start shooting. (Which I hate, I want to vent the stations air supply and call a temp service every time this happens [it is rare and avoidable, just not to a new player who doesn't read all the tutorials])The game is in no way complete but the developer has done more work on this title than any steam early access game I have ever had. (They also appear to be a nice/talkative person) I would recommend this title to anyone looking to play Evil Genius, or Dungeon Overlord, or whatever base simulation. This is fun, light hearted and can eat up 8 hours in a session. I would recommend sweeps watching Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency and giving the Spatials a shot. You might need to vent the atmosphere on the first few bases, but when you finally get that crew of cold blooded, laser packing, armor wearing, murder machines, it feels like you accomplished something. (Heck I haven't even travelled to the most distant stars, I usually on get out to the first expansion before I shake the ant farm.)"

It does have a lot of placeholders at present, and certain concepts are not fully fleshed out but the devs seem to be actively working on the game and seem to know what their aims are for the game itself. I particularly love how you have to go out and explore to find resources in the form of away missions.One issue I did have with the game however was that nothing at present seems logical. You have to provide things like soap pretty early on in the game, which to me would in a colony standpoint hygiene would be a second priority not a first. And your colonists will tear your base apart and murder each other over the fact they have no soap. You have to generate money but everything needed for making money seems extremely later on in terms of research. So I would say devs need to focus on progression heavily and making it sensible. Then this game will be a pure diamond."

I can understand why the manual is delayed given the developers plan to update frequently. I was disappointed though that the Spatials manual has been deleted from its website. I wanted some idea of how the old game worked. There are a very high number of rooms in the new game with no explanation of their purpose and impact on the station. Is it only cosmetic? If the developer is going to publish a new game without documentation, why not make a draft manual availble that mirrors the game and is updated as the game evolves? If you want to support the developers and want to be a part of and contribute to their work, then buy the game. Just realize that it is way, way underdeveloped at this point. Without any documentation, there are some significant gaps in game play. The tutorials are insufficient. I do think there is terrific potential in this game. For the time being, I think it's worth the price to play around in the sandbox."

I also like having to put on ships with crew to move resources across the galaxy.However, a lot of work needs to be done. First off, its missing some key features from The Spatials which I found this game annoying to play without. These are; the ablity to level up your spatials, plantary missions to move onto the next solar system and global stock control. I understand that the game is in early access and is still being worked on but I thought these would be a somewhat priority to make the game more enjoyable and playable rather than just a sandbox.It does have a lot of flaws at the moment but I'm excited for the development of The Spatials: Galactology."
,Not Recommended,450700,24168046,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,WadeStar,"Ok... this review's conclusion will center around the question: Is this game fun to play? To which the answer is currently no. Now this is still in alpha. I don't regret purchasing the game and I would add immediately that I *look forward* to enjoying this game. But at the moment it has little to offer someone who is looking for enjoyable gameplay. I spent about an hour with it and felt excited by the premise but uninterested--even frustrated--by the conclusion. A few examples of things I mean. While building the base I didn't feel I was making any interesting decisions. The tutorial and the goals guide you to setting up your first rooms, but you don't feel any pressure involved with the use of resources (or even what resources you're using). Exploring planets is interesting, but it feels more like you're exploring one square mile of a planet's surface than an actual planet. Meanwhile, your base will be attacked by intruders. By the time you collect yourself and zoom back, the intruder is already dead. Well, ok then. Next, some mechanics currently feel meaningless. There are various resources to gather on a planet which require one of three extractors. But what's the point of having three different extractors? There's no limit to how many of each you can build. There's no limit to whether they can overlap. There's no difference that I can see in what they cost. So why not have just one extractor to build for everything? (edit: 7/13/2016 -- now there actually only *is* one extractor! So this criticism is invalid). Because right now the only difference in terms of gameplay is which of three buttons you push. Effectively that's it. Did I mention your base is being attacked by robots now? Woops. Then there's the autopilot trade route system that is very promising, but it's difficult to tell from the interface whether it's toggled on or off (you can see me struggle with that at the end of my video).Again, it's early access. But not all early access games are created equal. Darkest Dungeon was a playable, enjoyable game when it was released. The Spatials: Galactology is not yet there. I don't need a completed campaign yet, but at the moment it feels more like an alpha test of game mechanics. To be fair, I think that's what the developers see it as currently. But if you're thinking about buying the game *right now* you need to be aware of what you're buying into. Personally, I look forward to future updates that give the game some direction and linear progression.Lastly, OMG the number of tiles all available at the start. Please, don't give me 50 options for room tiles. Just give me like 6 basic ones and let me unlock the rest with research. Even if the difference is just cosmetic.Let's Play #1:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQI4dVe_RMLet's Play #2:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iQRF1asHeg7/13/2016 (new update)Let's Play #3:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dB6eZaodzY"

I love how the little beings dance as they work. Some random friends show up to help, that's always exciting to me! You can really customize the spaces/buildings. Lots of options for flooring and walls. Lots of decorations. There is a lot of research to do to unlock more.This game starts out at a great pace, slow enough to figure everything out. It quickly speeds up to a place of slightly overwhelming. When you get so much going on, it is hard to keep track of everything. So if you like a challenge for organizing things, perfect game. Building so far has been straight foward. Compared to a game like Oxygen Not Included where you have to also learn how to use the research you unlock (like electic/plumbing). It is also forgiving when you do make a mistake. Low frustration game.For an early access game, this is fantastic. I haven't found any problematic bugs so far in about 9 hours of play.Great price for a lovely gem of a game.. if you like this type of game, It is one of the best in its class!"

I don't mind the ""placeholder"" messages, but it would be super nice if everything you can build had a note that says where you get the item. (So like, if you click on ""meat"" it could say ""planetary resource"" and if you click on ""red token"" it could say ""build at Cheat-O-Matic"".)That Cheat-O-Matic thing really threw me. I couldn't find any other way to make key items (Tonic X, for example) but I can't tell if that's me cheating or the developers cheating because they haven't figured out what device they really want to make that stuff for reals.So there is a lot to figure out in the game, like what objects block corridors and what ones do not, and the optimal placement of storage hoppers.And I've barely scratched the surface of planetary exploration or making money in bulk.So lots of fun if you like strategy puzzles.HINT: You have to hire new staff on the staffing panel (they don't just show up) after you build the recruitment stations, and until you do, don't take out more than one ship at a time... suffered massive losses twice in the early game before I figured that out."

If you want a game you can play now and enjoy now, go get The Spatials, not this. This game is not done. Item storage is a nightmare, character management is hardly even a concept, the galaxy itself has to be unlocked via a ""cheat"" because there is no progression to the game other than the unfinished research. The game, simply put, is an average sized pile of poopy pancakes. The why do I recommend this game? Because of its potential. The game was made in the format of one giant mod, so that it could have mod compatibilty, and mods add almost infinite replayability to almost any game that supports them. Add to that, The Spatials: Galactology was made off of The Spatials, an already basically finished game, so there is still plenty of stuff to do. I got this game for free, without even realizing it untill recently, because I already owned The Spatials. For the price it is going at ($12.99 at this point in time), buy it if you like to see a game develop. Or, if you don't want to invest money into something, buy it if it ever goes on sell.

I'm not sure if it's intentional, but the whole menu design and layout is not what your typical city / management sim would welcome.  It's very clunky and not intuitive in any sense of the word.  Upon creating my first few new worlds in both this and the original, I immediately was drawn to quit before I tried anything just because the interface looks way too touch-oriented and that completely prevented me from taking it seriously.HOWEVER.Underneath what I feel are poor GUI choices, I believe there is a substantial amount of content and I intend to discover it in the future.  I was able to scratch out a plethora of depth almost immediately after I watched my little Spatials start hammering out their first rooms.  I really wish it didn't take a ton of work to get used to the menu system, because I'd be exploring it at a more rapid pace than I am right now.  I'm intrigued and pulled in by the music and the concept of development chains, and I have to recommend it even with my short playtime because it really seems like it deserves the credit- the devs responded to the community so well that they remade the game and gave it to owners for free- that in and of itself is a sign that some people out there truly care about their work.

Gather the resources you want/need and bring them home Anno-games style.-Research new base building components.-Costumize what every one does. Maybe have one Spatial that only runs around and cleans?-Hint of diplomacy function.And so on.If you don't mind Early Access and want a Base Building RTS like game then give this one a try.

It's essentially a collection of systems that while interesting, aren't really tied together into a coherent whole.  There's really not much in the way of game here yet, to a much greater extent than I've experienced with any other early access title.  Unless you are super keen on acting as a tester, rather than a player, I'd suggest passing for now, because otherwise I suspect you will be dissapointed."

It is fairly polished for an early access game, everything I would expect to be here is here: base design, job management, resource gathering and production. If you are a fan on games like Banished or RimworldI would recommend this game.A few things that I noticed were:The whole space/planet exploration was an enexpected feature.Would be nice if you could manage the inventory of your units to space gear(air tanks, suits etc), weapons etc."

The crew has no sense of self preservation, why would you destroy the thing that makes  your food because  you dont have  soap. You are gouing to have to look up the order in which you need to do stuff because if you dont  your crew will get upset  and become useless. Then  as they get upset they break stuff and refuse to work. It is game over at this point because in compounds and everyone gets mad because you dont have a dance floor even though you have provided food, water and a place to sleep. Then there are the alert  messages. They are the most damn annoying thingin this whole game. You can trash them as they come in but they are then instantly replaced and pop up repeatedly reminding you how much you failed at building that fun stuff the  cre wanted...ya know cuz ♥♥♥♥ survival in a vacuum. Plus all my guys want to become scientists and they arent reserching (they get mad about not being promoted to so no waiting to  see if they can rank into something else). Do yourself a favor and move on. At least until this latest strain of♥♥♥♥♥is sorted  out. I could at least play it before."

At this writing, the game has been out for 6 months and the game is as unsettling as reentry without a heat sheild and a parachute.  I thought with this game looking like Spacebase DF-9 the product would be building on established game ballance as well as the graphics, but just the graphics are being used...So improvement items:1. the event notification bar gets overwhelmed very quickly and cannot be cleared easily2. the produciton paths aren't explained very well, including how space ship building works.3. the production paths aren't complete4. money generation isn't explained very well5. better ballance on character happieness6. there is a BIG grind needed for food generation, watch our you run out VERY quickly!I do look forward to seeing where this game goes in the next 6-12 months, however right now I'd wait till the core mechanics and game ballance are in place.Cheers,Ishi"

I'll stick with The Spatials and will leave Galactology to whatever fate the devs have in mind for it. It's turning out to be a game I would not have bought."

There isn't a game guide, clicking on help will tell you that the game guide is not done as the game is being updated too often to keep track.. except it hasn't been updated in months. There are several research items named ""Placeholder."" This is a shameless release of an unfinished product."

Game was free for people who already owned the first game.To start off, in its current state I believe it is worth the asking price.The Spatials is a star trek inspired space mall simulator with squad based combat. The original had a large emphasis on combat and exploration, finding new planets to conquer and exploit. Galactology, while very similar, places a lot more emphasis on management than combat. Galactology revamps a lot of the core mechanics and adds a lot of micromanagement options, making running the mall much more hands on and much more challenging.The RPG and RTS elements have changed significantly, allowing the team to be split, no more skill hotkeys, no more experience levels. Equipment can be manufactured or looted, and exploring beyond the first few systems is purely optional. Research tokens and quests are gone, and there is more in the way of diplomacy. You can also have multiple teams dedicated to exploration if you wish, but more than one is overkill. Your station and holdings can now be attacked. Building and managing space ships is a new thing. Crafting is more in depth.If you want a lot of combat, traditional leveling, and a more RPG feel, the first game is better. If you want to focus on building and managing your space mall, this is by far the better game. Many things may change between now and release, but on the whole it’s a lot of fun."
