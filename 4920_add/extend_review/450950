Before discovering the Danmaku Unlimited series, I wondered what a modern shmup even looked like. Do they even exist?Yes they do. This is it. The most gorgeous modern 2D shmup you'll play this year. Modern is good sometimes, you know.I'll go light on the review since I haven't played that much yet. Here are my first impressions:WOW, AMAZING, LASERS, BUTIFUL, LASERS, HARD, LASERS, SOUND SO GOOD, LASERS, OMG, LASERS XDThe controls feel perfect. There is a new style to the patterns which is great. You'll need some new strats for this one. Presentation and polish are top notch. And most importantly, it's fun. Really fun!A few minor issues I have, the music is much more aggressive than the last installement. That is personal preference, but I rather something a little less intense :) The flashy bullets do require some getting used to. And I wish there where stat bars filling up after a run. It would make progression much more apparent and fun.tl; dr: BUY THIS. PERIOD."

There's fun to be had, whether this is your first bullet hell or your 100th.Soundtrack!""Git gud"" pattern! There's no such thing as infinite continues. You want to progress, you have to earn it by learning to dodge. You want to improve your score? You have to learn to fly near bullets.Visuals: Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. It has a simplistic style yet flashy. It reminded me of a Playstation game that I can't even remember its name (it was also a shooter).Soundtrack: Blood pumping!https://blankfield.bandcamp.com/Cons: I have no cons so far, but if I find any I'll update my review.P.S.: I own a Hori Real Arcade Pro 4 Kai and I had no issues to recognize it (mine has a PC switch, alongside the PS3 and PS4 setting. If you don't know what I'm talking about ignore this). With that said, games like these are actually great with keyboard and the usual pad. There are people who have multiple world records in such games that they use keyboard or pad.The game at its full price is a steal!"

76561197998717797,Recommended,450950,31172466,Posted: 16 April,all,Khorne on the Kob,"An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.Not much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.It's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls."
,Recommended,450950,31291264,Posted: 22 April,all,applebaps,"If you'd sat me down in the days when I was only playing Touhou and Ikaruga, long before I ever saw a Donpachi or MAME or anything, and told me to design a shmup, I think something very like Danmaku Unlimited 3 would have come out.  That's not a bad thing.  DU3 oozes style, with a crisp, heavily-saturated palette and a pounding, grinding, kickass OST that's head and shoulders above just about everything else on the market, for my money.The game feel is well done in general, though enemy explosions are just a touch underwhelming for some reason.  Gone is the weird, self-obsoleting upgrade system from Danmaku Unlimited 2, replaced with shot and laser types linked to in-game achievements, a very welcome change.  You've got two modes of play, here, both centered around grazing enemy shots.  Killing enemies in Spirit Mode cancels their bullets into ghost bullets that you can still graze to raise your Trance meter (essentially a Hyper).  Graze Mode locks you out of raising the Trance meter until you first max out your Graze High, basically just making you graze more.  It also doesn't cancel most bullets on enemy deaths, and makes Hard the minimum selectable difficulty.The style of patterns on offer here is very much a combination of Ikaruga's waves of numerous popcorn enemies that don't actually fire at you and stationary, nigh-indestructible laser barriers, coupled with Touhou-style generally-slow-moving patterns with nice chunky gaps, creating a maze-like experience that's visually intimidating but often less difficult than it looks.  Bosses last just a touch longer than is comfortable, though this is a very minor complaint.Overall, this is a very solid 7 or 8 out of 10, which for $10 is well worth the money."
,Recommended,450950,30472759,Posted: 12 March,all,FreezingInferno,"I fell in absolute love with a beautiful little bargain here on Steam a while back named Danmaku Unlimited 2. It was a bullet hell shmup which carried with it the promise of ultra-difficulty for that genre's hardcore fans, but also the promise of accessibility for those who weren't veterans of weaving through bullets. Now after much anticipation that game has a sequel which promises the same ideals. While it's an absolutely solid game, I feel as if some of those promises weren't quite fulfilled.Just about everything in it is masterfully executed; the aesthetic and sound fits very well, with plenty of bright colors and pulsing guitar riffs and whatnot. It is a beautiful looking and sounding game, and (more importantly) it plays just as beautifully. It's danmaku stripped to the essentials. You have a normal fire button and a ""beam"" button that shoots a more powerful attack which makes you move slower. Bombs can be deployed in a pinch, and they also deploy if your core hitbox is damaged, saving you from losing a life if you have them. The bullets of destroyed enemies become powerups to fill your Trance Meter, and activating that when it's full turns the bullets into Gems which give you loads of points. You fight through waves of enemies, dodge lots of bullets, and then fight a boss with intricate and deadly bullet spreads with which to weave through. It's a near-flawless execution of the danmaku genre, and hardcore fans of it will be treated well.Where's the problem, then? It has to do with the promise of the game being built to be enjoyed by both newcomers and veterans of danmaku. I, coming from the newcomer side, had fun with it... but the previous game just felt a little more accessible and friendlier than this one. The previous game's upgrade system has been replaced with a set of unlocks, and you gain different weapons by completing different challenges. It's a fine system, but not one that lends itself well to a beginner. In addition, the option to increase your lives or the power of those weapons seems to be absent. You gain continues by the number of times you play the game, so eventually with that and the skill of pattern recognition you'll be able to pull through. It all seems like a catch-22, however; here are the means with which to get good at the game, rewarded to you for... being really good at the game. The newcomers need it but can't get it, and the hardcore types can get it but don't really need it. I have to say, I preferred the extra accessibility options of the previous title.Nevertheless, I did have a blast with this and it's still quite enjoyable. A danmaku veteran likely won't find the same faults I did with the game, so it comes recommended for anyone who's gone a few rounds with a Touhou or a CAVE game or what have you. Newcomers to the genre might be better served, however, by the previous release. Still, it gets a stamp of approval."

It's everything the previous game was, but prettier, tighter, more varied and far more difficult.The new SPIRIT/GRAZE system lets you turn the bullets of your enemies into opportunities for yourself. Patterns weave, undulate and force you into nasty traps unless you steel yourself and try to keep your head cool in the onslaught of bullets. Even Easy Mode is a challenge to be reckoned with, and the ultimate difficulty, True Graze mode, just boggles the mind.Coupled with a masterful, pounding soundtrack by djent metal god Blankfield, you simply cannot beat this package for masochistic shmup bliss. I will be banging my head against this wall of bullets for yours to come.TIme will tell if Danmaku Unlimited 3 takes its rightful place in the pantheon of fantastic shooters, but until then...ARISE FROM YOUR SLUMBERVALKYRIAJUSTICE TO THOSE WHO BRING MALICE"
76561198156231391,Recommended,450950,30435379,Posted: 10 March,all,tenlinkedparts,"Great game, improves significantly on DU2. Honestly, I'd pay $15 or even $20 for this, so I bought it at full price. It's definitely worth that much! The move to a PC exclusive has done a lot of good for this developer, even though DU2 is still very good.Got rid of those silly upgrades and replaced them with the ability to pick different weapons for your ship. A very interesting way of doing difficulty levels: the Graze mode is basically a fifth difficulty, taking the Spirit mode on True difficulty a step further. Some interesting patterns, like a lot of what boss 3 does. Spirit Easy actually seems kinda challenging instead of boring like most games, especially for a beginner. The way the game hands out resources is not very far off from my ideal, something I can really get behind.There's not much to actually complain about. Anything I can think of is mere opinion, nothing based in fact. I always thought the DU graphical style was kinda weird; drab colors and half-abstract designs leading to what can be construed as a ""same-y"" look. The way the game looks and many of the sound effects tell me this series would do well with a soundtrack like HellSinker or Akashicverse, not the violent guitars of Blankfield. Speaking of which, aside from the music, this series overall seems like a weird mix of Ikaruga and HellSinker/Akashicverse in audiovisual design... it's kinda interesting."
,Recommended,450950,30449009,Posted: 11 March,all,Koligrand,"This game is my first real Danmaku Bullet Hell game, so mind that I dont have anything to compare it to.The game gives you a lot of options to play the game: Form easy to superhard. And it recommends a gamemode for beginners like me, where the bomb activates atomatically before you get hit.I feel the levels so far are well designed, but for me the part beween mid-boss and endboss of a level could be more streched out. Every time I play i get a little further as I learn the patterns more.Visually the game looks good and the soundtrack really stands out with it´s superb quality.I recommend the game for beginners, as for danmaku experienced players i cant tell if it´s hard enough or how they feel about the game."
,Recommended,450950,30425467,Posted: 10 March,all,CAPTAIN HUMPHRIES,"Great game, a heck of a lot of fun even for new players, but the balance is somewhat off - bosses 1&2 are rather easy, 3 is about the right level, but 4 and above I feel are somwhat luck based even, and the second and final stages of the 4th boss are just downright completely unfair. UPDATE: The final stage has been fine tuned, and now with the addition of free mode boss rush, this makes practice much easier, a very nice addition which makes the bosses seem much more approachable!A bit of comparison of difficulty - I have spent 4 hours on DNMK UNL. 2 and beaten the game comfortably on normal; I had to spend roughly 10 hours to beat this on easy!Otherwise, excellent mechanics and a VERY good soundtrack; money well spent!"

,Recommended,450950,30414840,Posted: 9 March,all,Nirriti,"""Danmaku Unlimited 3""is a wonderful gem packed with excitement, gorgeous lasers and soundtracks giving it the extra miles to stand out. I stumbled upon""Danmaku Unlimited 2""yesterday in fact and played it(was 1$)and wasn't dissapointed at all! I loved it. Then discovered the 3rd title was about to be released I had no worries it would have been a great improvement all around from it's predecesor. Guess what? It is! Everything has been made better and more enjoyable all around. Visuals and sounds alike.PROS:- Improved LASERS Visuals (eye candy!)- Each BOSSES are Exciting!- Amazing Soundtracks- Beam Types (+unlockables)- Freerun Mode- Descriptive Tutorial- LOTS of Options- Controller Compatibility- Achievements + Cards- Highscores (with 3 chars input)- Vertical Screen (option)CONS:- Only 5 levelsThere is the learning of pattern as in every ""Bullet Hell Shmup"". Fortunately, the game features a FREERUN mode, which allows you to pick a level number and practice there directly. In this context would be a blessing considering the learning part of a specific boss instead of redoing all the previous levels each time until you are familiar enough with the patterns. The game could have been made way more brutal but the option is there for practice.More options is ALWAYS better for the consumer.For that I can only praise the game even more. Makes me think of Dark Souls in some way. You get better and adapt after taking enough punishment. It's just more satisfying and rewarding in the end! Every now and then, the player will get permanently more continues for every runs! Pretty cool.Solid 9/10 in my book.For everyone who ever wished for such a good ""Bullet Hell"". It's easy to play but challenging (and rewarding) to master! If you are unsure I suggest you try the 2nd ""Danmaku"". If you like the 2nd, there is no way ""Danmaku Unlimited 3"" will dissapoint you.It's exactly what it promises to deliver."
76561198339611166,Recommended,450950,31467341,Posted: 30 April,all,hookian,"I have played all three of three of the games in the series. I adopted the first one on mobile as it was one of the few shooters that actually worked on a mobile phone with any level of success. When the second game arrived on Steam i was eager to try it again on the big screen and i certainly had a lot of fun with it. This brings us to this the third installment, this version takes a gigantic leap away from just feeling like a ported mobile game to a fully fledged example of what an HDmodern danmaku game should be. The presentation and overally style is fantastic, the neon soaked visuals are beautiful and a sight to behold. The only weak point for me and this is a personal thing is the music. Im not a big fan of the ripping guitar style and would love it if there was a alternative soundtrack mode. The producers should hit up 'Ser Flash' he would do wonders on this game after recently doing the score for Ghost Blade HD.if you like shooters then you owe it to yourself to check out this great game and if you have a vertical monitor it supports that also, giving you a fantastic modern arcade experience.4/5, only marked down for the music...in my opinion.P.s this game is not easy, but dont be put off, the ability to unlock extra's is a nice touch to keep you trying and bettering your play technique."

The difficulty is on point, it really remind me of Dodonpachi type of difficulty. The music from blankfield is really good. How a indie dev grab this band I don't know, yet I can buy their soundtrack of the game at bandcamp. The only bad thing I can say so far is the controller issue. Hopefully the dev team will address it in the future to make them work on most of them. Other than that I recommend anyone to try this game out. Dirt cheap for $10 and the replayablility is there."
,Not Recommended,450950,31589882,Posted: 6 May,all,WUMBOL0GY,"The game is well made. Graphics are good, sound is good, soundtrack is excellent although it gets old fast, hit boxes are accurate and gameplay is smooth, and bullet patterns are good but a little unbalanced at some difficulties. The game is also well optimized and runs without any hitches, and menues are well designed and easy to use. The game also gives plenty of gameplay options and shot types.The only problem that brings the game down and ruins the whole experience is the gimmick mechanic. Get super close to bullets even when it's unnecessary to build up the boost mode meter. When the meter fills, you clear the screen of bullets and get a massive power boost to your shots and a bit wider shot range for a limited time. The idea of giving the player an incentive to get near bullets is not good when you are learning how to play these games. It's actually counterintuitive. The way to learn these games is to gradually and incrementally improve your strategies and instincts as you continue to play. The way this mechanic works does not allow for that type of learning curve to exist. When the game incentivises to get close to bullets, it breaks your process of improvement through survival instincts and reflexes. It teaches you to be reckless and mindless, which is counterintuitive.This is made even worse in the more casual mode called ""spirit mode"". Whenever you kill an enemy, their bullet paths stay on screen, but their bullets become harmless. This allows the player to build the boost meter without harming themselves in the process. This causes its own problems as you tend to throw yourself straight into bullet paths you anticipate becoming nullified, but don't. It also becomes a confusing clutter of bullets that are real and fake. It even made me nauseous a few times.There's no doubt that the idea of challenging yourself by playing dangerously sounds like a cool, hardcore idea on paper, and it might actually be for those who have already played bullet hell games for years and gotten to that point. For anyone who wants to improve rather than just show off, stay the ♥♥♥♥ away.Edit: I should add that I have played these games outside of steam, so the hours played is not accurate. I bought the game because I finally got an arcade stick and wanted to try it out again."
,Not Recommended,450950,31658943,Posted: 9 May,all,Aoi,"Pass on this shooter.-The levels are bland, uninspired, and repetitive.-The music is the most annoying guitar riffs ever.-Bosses are too long, perhaps longer than their actual levels.-The bosses look like ships ripped out of FTL, they're totally basic.-The scoring system is nearly 20 years old, and adds nothing new to the genre.-The difficulty bounces all over the place.-The patterns are gimmicky. Like, bar none, I'm getting a refund for this, I don't go for STGs where you get instant death from gimmicks. Even after learning the gimmick pattern, it just repeats on and on and on cause the boss length is too long.I have some of the highest 1CC leaderboard scores in Crimzon Clover, I've 1CC'd several Cave shooters, I'm not just some casual scrub with their first game (granted I'm no pro either, but it is a genre I enjoy).

It has simple, clean visuals that don't confuse the player. Bullets are colored so that you can tell what is hostile and what isn't (most of the time, anyhow.). It is extremely challenging for those who ask for it (and those who don't but hey, par for the course for this genre)Just be prepared however as this game can be extremely unforgiving.

From chasing level high scores to overall high scores, to just trying to beat this game on a respectable difficulty level, this game provides the goods.  Im using a dual shock 4, and the controls are so tight, any mistake is purely my own.  I keep coming back and keep getting beat down, but every day i get better and progress farther.  Graphics and sound top any shmup on Steam IMO. Gameplay as well.  It's hard to beat this one.  If you're interested, give it a go.  Hands down 10X better than Danmaku Unlimited 2.

Better than DU2 since difficulty is more consistent now, still lacks some decent playtesting imo. Some boss bullet patterns are too random and you don't know where to move + it takes ages to finally go past them. Boss fights are certainly too long and could have at least have two patterns less.Dodging bullets feels nice and scoring is alright. Graphics are fresh and polished, it's easy to spot bullets on screen. Tracks are worse than in DU2 but I always mute music in games so I don't really care.Play some CAVE games."
