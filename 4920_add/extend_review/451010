,Recommended,451010,25066775,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,ExcaliburVT,Definitely one of my favorite games for the Vive.  This is a must have for anyone who loves the tower defense genre.  This along with Quar: Battle for Gate 18 are two games that I think really take advatage of the room scale and controllers for a great game that is not one of the cookie cutter demos that have been coming out lately.  This is close to AAA game quality and well worth your purchase.

It works better seated, in my opinion, as controls will allow you to turn around the level pretty easily. I spent many hours on it completing the campaign. Some points can be annoying due to the lack of a way to select a specific target for turrets, but this doesn't detract to the experience.I have already recommended the game to my all my friends, so I will recommend it here as well."

I stumbled across this title thanks to the folks atVRupload.comThe game came reccomended by thier staff so I figured I would give the title my money and see if the positive review was on point for me. I will preface that I generally am not a fan of most Tower Defense type games, to date, the only TD game that held my attention was Plants vs. Zombies for its entertaining presentation and gameplay.  Kittypocalypse has shown me the future of TD games. While it contains a loose story that provides mild entertainment, the game shines in execution. The tutorial is crisp and quick and needed for your first play through.The ability to zoom, spin, and manipulate the map in full 3D space turns what could have been a TD clone into a full on giggle riot and breaths air of life into the title. Well crafted assets and terrain design make blasting kitties to green alien goo provide plenty of incentive to build solid defenses and zip to ground level and watch the mayhem unfold.The skirmish mode offers solid challenge and the campaign is worth a play through (I am at 10/15 levels at this time). My children (teen and pre teen) both picked up base mechanics quickly and we took turns watching each other play and giving advice to stop the kitty hordes. We all found the title to be enjoyable with plenty of pick up and replayability.Not a VR game to introduce 1st timers to, but one to share with those who have spent some time with the VR unit of their choice. This has found a place with me and my minions, and I look forward to hours more of play. You would be wise to pick this up even if you are not a fan of the genre, as you will be after playing.http://bolverkgames.com/has done the genere a favor here with this quality title, and the possibilities for TD and RTS games on the VR platforms are limitless and waiting for more worthy games to be crafted and shared to the world."

,Recommended,451010,27053275,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Sexy Boat Captain,"Wow!!!  This is an incredibly well done (probably the best all around polished Vive game in fact) tower defense game.  If I had known it was this good, I'd have bought it a long time ago and wouldn't have bothered to wait for a sale.Edit: I've had this game for three weeks now and already have 19 hours on it - had the Vive for 8 months now and 19 hours is the most time on any of them by far.  Look at all the reviews and see how many hours people have in this thing.  Save your marriage, save your job, save yourself and don't buy this game or it'll consume you and affect everything you value and love.Let's face it, most tower defense games are junk: there is too much focus on the art and not on gameplay, the controls are wonky, it's hard to differentiate units, the AI sucks and  they are too easy.Here's why this game is awesome:This game has beautiful graphics in a fun and rich VR environment.The tutorial is short, but covers everything you need to know.The controls are very easy to use, and within a few minutes you'll have them mastered.It's really easy to move about the environment and control your units.The AI is really good, you'll find your units doing on their own what you'd do if you were controlling them.It's very easy to get an idea of where your units are and what unit is what since you see everything in VR.On the hard difficulty, it's really challenging.  I was trying to make sure not even one kitten made it through, then I had to switch to just making it through the level.  This is my main complaint about most Tower Defense games is that they are too easy.  This game ramps up fast, but not just by sending hordes of kittens at you, but by testing your defenses by sending them in specific orders that make you really think about how you should place your towers.In summary: This game is awesome!  The developer nailed every facet of making a VR game great and has released one of the few complete, fully polished, VR games out there.  I can't believe it's only $20.  Unless you really hate Tower Defense games for some reason, just give it a try and refund it if you don't like it.  If you haven't tried Tower Defense games before, then this is a great first Tower Defense game!"

From the trailers it looks like a standard Tower Defense game, and it is. It's not redefining the genre or anything. But what trailers can't really capture is how well it does VR.The UI works well and is for the most part intuitive.While the right controller acts as the mouse the left one controls the map, you can move the game world, turn it around, zoom in and out. Of course, if you're doing roomscale you can just walk around the map. The game also scales seamlessly between giant mode and standing right in the action, allowing you to switch between romscale and seated on the fly. One second you are towering over the map, managing your units, then you're standing right next to a tower you just built as it starts firing at little kitties.I've always thought that the Vive would be perfect for strategy games and this game confirms it."

The ability to be first person on the ground, yet high up in the sky looking down is just a really really cool feeling. I've played sitting in a chair for hours it seems. The immersion is just amazing. Yes it's ""expensive"" for a VR game, but it's an actual game, and not just a demo. One of my favorites at this point. I realize I sound like a spambot, but I'm not. The game is relatively simple (so far at least) since you only have a few spots to actually place towers; unlike Defense Grid or other TDG where you can make your own maze and direct things. But maybe later levels will allow for that, not sure.Anyway I've wanted to refund quite a few of my VR purchases as I completed them in 10 minutes. This one I'm still playing and enjoying greatly."

,Recommended,451010,25356660,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,St1mpy,"Summary: Well polished tower defense made for VRThis is a tower defense game at its simplest and most refined. 15 levels, with tower placement locations around the map. However depending on the map only 5 or so of these are useful.From what I have played your tower choice does actually matter though, with different enemies having specific vulnerabilities. For example armored kittens need high powered laser beams. Some kittens run fast and you need fast firing weaponry to take them down. There are many upgrade paths, although some of the towers are very similar visually, and it is unclear which upgrades are available.The navigation is what makes this unique. You can free move round the whole map. This isn't very accessible however, as it requires a bit of time to get used to the motion. It will make you sick at first if you make the wrong movements, but through negative re-enforcement, you learn to stop doing things that make you sick. You are entirely in control so it works!I am about 5 levels in, and typically keep my play sessions to one level max.PositivesIt is very satisfying to see your base as a scale model and then zoom into ground level and back up again at will.It feels like the kind of thing VR was made for as when zoomed out, units appear as toys, and then appear as full-size cats.The guns are well modelled, and the environments are detailed, if a little too 'sand and rock' based for the time being. Like I said, I am not too far in, but maybe it improves later on.The sound is good, with technical issues I will mention later.ComplaintsI am having audio-problems on a freshly formatted PC with the Vive audio output. This is on the latest OS, with a GTX1080. Maybe the issue is my 2700k sandy-bridge is a bit out of date and is a bottleneck, but the crackly audio is an issue.There are no bosses in this game so far. Maybe they have yet to come, but a main feature of tower defense for me is stronger units which take way more damage, with unique models/skins. This would break up the gameplay as the waves can get a bit repetetive.Also it does take a bit long for the game to get going. You start with only 2 or 3 turrets and no upgrades, but the scope expands after about 3 maps.Also, this is a VR that has lots of standard interface elements. IMHO we should be pushing for interfaces which are not boxes on screens, but that is a personal gripe with the current crop of VR games more than anything."

It might be nice if there were more of a tutorial on how to use anhilators and teslas. When I tried them they were worthless so I just ignored them. Apparently they are useful.--- Original Review ---Really has potential! But the level balance is beyond rage inducing. Dudes... you need to test your difficulties a few more times. I'm no stranger to tower defense games. Tuldigon level is ridiculously hard even on easy.

And a pretty solid one at that.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb0Ukzgr3YcKittypocalypse as some solid and for th emost part intuitive controlls for a VR TD game. You're able to drop into the action or pull way out to see all the kity carnage at once.Towers seem pretty varied with multiple upgrade paths and strategy seems to be key. You're shown early on that you'll need varied towers as the machine guns do nothing against armored units. Literally nothing, they're immune. I'm only on mission 3 but it seems like there will be plenty of room for strategy.The only issues I had with the game were that exiting the map after winning wasn't initially obvious but that's partially because I'm a little slow sometimes... The only prompt to remind you how to get out of a map after beating the mission was the button on your controller flashing. It's easier than you'd expect to overlook that.The other minor issue is that the menu follows you whereever you look. Most times that's not an issue but it can be annoying if you're trying to look at something else and it gets in your way. Like the fireworks after beating a level... It also impacts larger menus though as some of the important menus such as purchasing towers, have important information in the upper left corner. That corner isn't easily visible without moving your head... which causes the menu to move with your head. It ends up making you look like a dog chasing it's tail.In all honesty though, that was the worst I encountered. I do hope they put in an option to speed up time as waiting for the kittens to walk into your deathzone can sometimes be a bit boring but overall it's a well polished game. Yeah, an actually fully functioning game for VR... who know it was possible...If you're debating the cost, it's worth the price tag. You get more game for your $ than most other titles out atm."

In order to stop them you use the vive or xbox controller to move around the world from god mode where you can be above everything to close up first person action of the kitten carnage!You place turrets down much like Baloon TD and set up a strategy to make sure none of the mass waves of cats get through your defenses. There are many different types of turrets and upgrades for each turret to make this game highly strategic at it's later levels.The cats themselves also come in many different forms in the first level alone they come in three or more forms, regular cute kitten, kitten in a box, and armored kitten which can only be damaged by a laser turret.If enough of the cute kittens break through then they take over the control point and you lose.....to a cat!There are fifteen total levels which I assume will take around 5+ hours of gameplay if not more!I will update this after I get through with the game completely with how much play time it took and will have videos on my youtube channel covering it.For now however, since the trailer can only show so much gameplay if you would like to see more about this game check out my gameplay commentary linked below!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=745441374"

The towers can missing units no matter how upgradede they are. Sometimes gutlings shooting in a walls, some times missles just cant finde enemy and whole wave just go through."

Its like you 'grow' as you get closer to the table, which bends all kinds space/time upchuck properties.  If the table could be fixed in space at a certain size (like 'Castle Must Be Mine') id give this game almost a perfect score.  Please please change the movement mechanics or at least provide thjis as an option for those with weak-to-normal upchuck thresholds.  Let those with ironguts use the current method."

But the autoscroll/autozoom function is a killer, it's SO sickening (it's not Onward, this is seriously vomit inducing). And also misleading, with roomscale the whole level can stay inside your chaperone, why to force the camera to speed up scrolling and change world scale? It had to be 1:1 with real life, not 10:1! Can't be disabled, just slowered. Tabletop and roomscale are a perfect match, I can't understand why Kittypocalypse want to push artificial locomotion where is not needed. Sorry devs, this is a refund."

I just slow down on moving the camera XDOn a side note, it would be a lot more fun if there were more places to build towers, rather a free for all within a range as opposed to fixed points in the level.  I understand it is part of the challenge, but it WOULD make it a hell of a lot more entertaining :)honestly, 8/10.  Pretty damn good."
