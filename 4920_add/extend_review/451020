,Recommended,451020,35471075,Posted: 4 October,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Battle Chasers: Nightwaris a solid and welcome addition to the JRPG genre.They got it right. The world is beautiful, and the story is worthwhile. The combat animations are some of the best I've seen, and the hits carry weight. There are tons of unlockables and progression feels good. You can choose the difficulty level of the dungeons and alter the payout. Yes, that's been done before but it works well here.Also, the fishing is fun!Essentially, to me, this is a modernized version of the good oldFinal Fantasygames from long ago.The core exploration and fantasy story is there, along with a slew of modern bells-and-whistles such as the unlockables. While this is probably the most AAA game I've played this year, it doesn't feel too gross in that department. But yeah, there is a ton of polish. The sound effects and music are great, and the world is just so *beautiful*.Most people that read my reviews are into indie games at indie prices.Is this worth the high-ish asking price? Yeah, it is.Pros:+The artwork is obviously stunning with animations to match+I'm not a story kind of guy, but this is delightful+Everything feels balanced so far, progression is satisfying+Lots of cool unlockables+The crafting system is fantastic!+The fishing is fun for sure+Great game to play from the couch+The characters have depth and I'm interested in themCons:-Why is there no option to speed up battle animations? I'm not complaining just yet, but after a dozen hours I would think people would want that-Yes, the overworld map is open like a sandbox, but progression is still kind of linear; this was true of the older JRPGs as well, but it's all about how you hide thatIf you are in the mood for a great modern JRPG - thenBattle Chasers: Nightwaris what you are looking for.Totally worth full price."

Totally recommended for the RPG crowd, specially for the old-school type of fans."
,Recommended,451020,35453394,Posted: 3 October,all,XRuinX,"Cool enemies, nice variation. Bosses are unique and cool. I love the art style too, it introduces some cool stuff the further you go. (keeping this spoiler free) You get a handful of abilities early on, which was a nice suprise. Great voiceacting and cutscenes too - i expected these characters to be generic but they're all pretty cool. I was afraid about the roguelike element because honestly i didnt want that in a jrpg but blends in unnoticably, so if you're worried about that part i'd say don't be.What else can I say? I like it.(also, if you're a Berserk fan you can see the inspiration)"

I might update this review in the future once I beat the game just in case I spot any bugs that needs to be under the radar.But for now here's why I think this game is awesome and why people should give this game the love that it needs.(Scroll Down to the end if details bore you)COMBATThe turnbased combat is very reminiscent to Final Fantasy games while introducing it's own unique mechanics such as  ""Overcharge""Overcharge is basically temporary mana a character is given whenever they do regular actions in combat. It's a mechanic that encourages activity over inactivity, the first I've seen in a turnbased game and probably one of my favorites.#MakeTurnbasedGreatAgainTORCHLIGHT + KH: CHAIN OF MEMEORIES EXPLORATIONExploration in Battle Chasers: NW shares similarities withTorchlight(for level designs) andKingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories(for dungeon layout & enemy encounters). Also, the layout of the dungeons changes whenever you revisit them on a different difficulty, this gives a non linear experience everytime you attempt to grind or farm in an area.NARRATIVEThe writing is excellent in my opinion, the characters are endearing and the lore is all the more intriguing. But what I enjoy most about the writing are the subtle jokes the writers slip in from time to time...I mean, when I was fishing the game said I caught a fish that legends say could talk, but since I hooked it out of the water, it died and I can never test the theory anymore.VISUALSI'm biased cuz I really love comicbook like artstylesAs far as that goes, all I can say is that it's pretty fu**** amazing how they handled the cutscenes with that artstyleLike.

One can think it will be boring with time. Well for now I am not.They combine ""old school"" japanese rpg style with western rpg ideas. And it works.What I like :- different loot rarities (white, green, purple...) and crafting (most of the loot in battles - not too much gold)- no infinite mana/health (you can regen at the inn and encounters on the map respawn so you can ""farm"") so you need to manage your team and the mana mechanics >- > combat mechanic : basic quick attacks which usually bring ""excess free mana"" you can use before using your mana pool for charging slower attacks- Visible turn order changing depending on actions- Nice fishing mini gameWhat I don't like :Nothing ? But if I had to say one thing it would be long and slow movement on the map when you clear its encounters. But I think teleporters will be activated when I advance in the story (already found three)"
,Recommended,451020,35481854,Posted: 4 October,all,N7Insomniac,Love this game. Great artwork with  gameplay that is interesting fun and most of all fresh.
,Recommended,451020,35508994,Posted: 5 October,all,Asmo6035,"Pros:Beautiful Graphics and stylingGreat fight animationsGood number of skill sets to useDungeon skills are an interesting dynamicNice voiceovers and storylineCons:Slow pacedSlightly GrindyHighly Linear gameplayOdd crafting systemHeavy level gatingNo autobattleBattle Chasers will take in most RPG players with its great steampunk styling and beautifully rendered graphics and animation work. There is little not to like about the great Diablo/Torchlight style. Dungeons are randomized using individual stylesets that the game chooses from and places accordingly -- so even though its random, players can enjoy the incredible level of work and detail that went into designing each level.It is worth noting here that the game is not 100% complete yet, so there is likely still a lot of work to be done, but I will delve a bit into my issues with the game as far as gameplay.The first thing to note is that this game is SLOW. Walking around the instanced dungeons, or even the world map itself feels like its moving at a snails pace. It may be that I am simply used to faster paced gameplay but, having read the reviews, a lot of players are stating the same thing. The game would do well to speed up map movements, as some of the dungeons can be quite long as it is, and the slow walking speed is a constant source of aggravation.Likewise, the game pace is slow in terms of leveling, with the party leveling up once per dungeon instance which can take as long as an hour to complete. However, the leveling speed is intentional by design -- Battle Chasers is a highly linear environment. No matter how much you grind, you'll find that your level will always closely match that of the opponents you're facing in the storyline. The game is designed to penalize players attempting to overlevel by dramatically decreasing the amount of experience earned for enemies that are a lower level than you. This is dissapointing, as you never really feel as though you're progressing or becoming more powerful during gameplay, as there is no incentive to fight enemies lower level than your own.Adding insult to injury, all character weapons and equipment in the game are heavily gated with level requirements. Essentially this translates into very restricted gameplay -- not only can you rarely outlevel your opponents, but even if you find that ultra rare weapon, it will either be specifically for your character level (meaning its not overpowered) or you won't be able to equip it until much later in the game....basically when it won't be as cool a find.When it comes to equipment in general, there are a few ways you can obtain it. You can purchase it from vendors, find it in battles or in chests, or craft it yourself. The crafting system in the game is not something I've really dived into, owing to its complexity. As far as I know from my admittedly limited time playing the game, you may only craft items at specific workbenches that you'll find in dungeon crawls. Unfortunately I think this really plays against any crafting system. Dungeons are for looting and leveling, not for crafting equipment, and this gameplay mechanic seems very out of place.More importantly, I felt that crafting in the game was entirely too complicated and ultimately a waste of time. In order to craft equipment, you must first purchase the various crafting books to teach you recipes. The crafting books themselves cost several hundred gold a piece, whereas the equipment that you'd be crafting is readily available for purchase at the vendors for just a few hundred more. Crafting is also gated behind the leveling system, meaning you won't be able to craft high level items until your character level matches (though even if you could, you still wouldnt be able to equip them)Possibly the worst aspect of the game is that even though its obvious the developers spent a lot of time regulating leveling and equipment to maintain game balance, there were still a lot of instances where it felt very off. I could be going through a dungeon decimating all enemies in my path without even using skills, only to die unmercifully to the end stage boss. Part of the reason for this is due to the games heavy reliance on DOT mechanics, which can add up to several hundred damage per turn. This wouldn't be so bad if your characters could inflict a similar level of DoT damage on enemies, but it is actually paltry in comparison. Likewise, its difficult to tell how much damage your character will take from any of the many DoT effects, making it hard to properly prepare for in battle.The game is good, but needs some work to really shine, especially in the gating and crafting areas."

I still have the comics and know the characters a fair bit so I am not coming in blind. If you're new you may wonder who these people are since there is no introduction at all. The game is presented as part of their regular adventures. So on that note you may be a bit disappointed.However, combat, animations, controls, weapon designs, and just overall quality this is an amazing game. Would recommend to anyone."

,Recommended,451020,35462144,Posted: 3 October,all,Roused Wookie,"So far, I'm finding myself pleasantly surprised at about 5 hours in.An obvious throwback to old JRPG's, reminscent of Chrono Trigger and the FF series. However! It's been polished and updated for modernity, featuring an interesting take on the ol' turn-based combat and a much needed new interpretation of the 'world map, all of which makes it feel fresh versus what I expected to be just a plain homage to JRPG nostalgia. Plus, you get the ARPG-ish randomly generated dungeons and tons of looting and, most importantly, FISHING!Art style is a unique steampunk/fantasy and it is fantastic. Soundtrack is an understated brilliance. Narrative is nothing groundbreaking yet. It runs buttery smooth and I have yet to encounter a single bug, minor or otherwise; the level of polish is impressive.It really ain't bad for $30."

Cat jumps on keyboard while I am actively using the controller, the game freaks out by swapping between keyboard and controller input repeatedly. Then I can no longer interact with objects, enemies do not attack me, I cannot open doors, I cannot open loot, I can't fish. Nothing that requires an interaction works.

In this game we are already IN the middle of our adventure. The prologue of the game does a good job explaining a story.Multi language in subtitles and audio (including character voice), the devs done a pretty good job providing so many languages choice.Will play more to dig into the game and perhaps update my review sometime in the future."
,Not Recommended,451020,35463641,Posted: 3 October,all,Luno Myr,"TL;DR: If you're like me and, 1. don't know anything about Battle Chasers, and 2. don't have any particular nostalgia for JRPGs past, this game might not do enough differently or interestingly to keep your attention.Seems perfectly competent, but unfortunately, in a sea of exceptional games and limited time, competent isn't enough for me.The art style and animations pulled me in, but in the first 1.5 hours, there was nothing to keep me there. The story seems really bland, and it isn't told in an interesting way (first red flag was the game opening with a big expository wall of text introducing you to all the characters unnaturally--honestly, if you had just completely cut that, the game would have been fine and I would have been more intrigued about these characters with the intro cutscene as the first introduction).Combat works, but doesn't have an interesting enough twist on tired JRPG tropes to make me want to explore it further. The overcharging is a nice addition, but isn't enough to make combat truly interestly; Bravely Default's system of sacrificing and taking an advance on turns is an example of a twist that's interesting enough to carry the game.This is probably personal prefence, but I also think that the overcharging-type mechanic has already been done better in Persona Q, in which every characterstartsevery fight with an ""overcharge"" of mana to use. In that scenario, it encourages using your fun abilities from the getgo, even in short fights, which makes the combat more interesting in the early game while still maintaining the long-term resource management of a permanent mana store.I understand that I've played less than two hours and can't expect the game to show me its full hand in that time, but--especially in such a saturated genre and ESPECIALLY on a platform that only lets you return games that you've played for less than a couple hours--it really shouldn't take that long for the game to get interesting. In 90 minutes, I rarely used anything other than basic attacks in combat, and I'm not willing to risk missing the refund window in hopes of it getting more interesting. If the narrative (or even just the premise) were interesting, maybe I'd push through. But right now, it's just the art. And I can look at pictures of the art without having to mash A through a bunch of slow, uninteresting fights.Also, this is minor, I suppose, but for a game with such pretty visuals, I'd expect those same levels of quality to carry over into the UI/menus (especially for a genre in which navigating menus is the primary gameplay interaction), but the menus were really bland and borderline ugly. We're living in a post-Persona 5 world; bare minimum for JRPG menus is not gonna cut it.Overall, I could see myself coming back to this when I'm out of games to play, but with all the amazing stuff coming out, that may be a while."

I just cant say enough good things about this game.  Buy it, play it, love it.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS GAME!!"

It can work in South park, but there is a fun story and black humor...I loved Battle Chasers comics in my childhood, but i think the game is really boring. Dont get me wrong, many people will love it, but not me... Just... I tired from another jrpg without any new feature.For the same price i recommend you to buy Divinity OS2."

Since I only have less than two hours of gameplay, I can't comment nor will review what it has to offer.  It's promising, but without resolving the bugs, I can't recommend it.Edits for those who downvoted this review and/or posted comments:-Graphic glitches everywhere.  Overworld especially.  Lots of lag.  Made it very jarring.-I have less than two hours because I wanted to refund it due to those graphic issues.-I won't pay for a released game that has a bug from the get go.  It's an indicator of other bugs which are being reported all over the place."

Could have won any battle without any tactical forethought. I like these games when you have to build a tactical team. If you enjoyed final fantasy tactics, don't play this."

,Recommended,451020,35460689,Posted: 3 October,all,EBVoice,"This game is everything that I ever hoped for.  The gameplay is familiar to me, yet it also feels fresh.  It's awesome to finally see these characters come to life.I've been a fan of the comic series for a long time and I can't wait to see more of this.  Also, Joe Madureira said he would make more comic issues after the game has been out for a while.  ALL OF THE HYPE!!"

Great Gameplay = Yes.. I figured i would try it out b4 the 2 hour refund but man oh man, I just stopped now to right this reveiw then i am going right back at it! I am not a big fan of JRPG's but this one isnt all Flashy with eye straining visuals everytime you attack or are being attacked. Theres a perk system, theres a skill system, theres crafting (potions and gear) in a rustic like setting (medival like) tons of bosses and mobs (i mean TONS!) and the best of all, it carries your playthrough over to NG+ Baby! Oh yeah. Pick this one up, worth what there asking (even more IMO) you wont regret it. Just look at the times people have logged already, My 2 cents"

Fantastic music, graphic and animations. Lots of depth in the battle system and the characters leveling.Difficulty seems to be well balanced.I love that the dungeon don't auto level with you (you actually get a feeling of power by levelling, and you can farm loot more easily if you wish to play like that).Looking at the kind of game being made nowadays en masse, I guess this one is rather an ovni and will not be for the latest generation of gamers. But if you are old school, annoyed that most nice looking rpg are free to play on mobile nonesense, then jump on this.It's a dream come true."

I'm very pleased with the game after 16 hours with my only criticism being that it is a bit grindy, but I do indeed love grindy games.  I really like saving up mats and money to upgrade and imporve gear.  I have skipped every single video and chat bubble, that is not a diss on the game, but a personal thing.. time is money boys.  I hope to 100% the achievs and I think that is possible with enough playtime invested.  There is a clear path of progression, but I like to redo most of the dungeons on legendary.  I can easily watch the world burn on the news while I play this game in my peripheral vision.  It is very satisfying soldiering on through this game."

76561198022318021,Recommended,451020,35481140,Posted: 4 October,all,Zyren,"Definitely enjoying this game. It has the feel of the old school RPGs and the flair of Torchlight. Voice acted, entertaining story, what you see in the pictures and videos is exactly what you get with this game. I've been dying for a decent game to use my steam link and controller with; and this game just perfectly fits that bill. If you're someone like me who just wants a solid, slower paced, single player adventure for a change...Battle Chasers certainly scratches that itch good and proper."

,Recommended,451020,35510369,Posted: 5 October,all,Agathos,"Very enjoyable JRPG.Driving is a bit wonky w/ the WASD, but it isn't a detraction from the game at all.The combat is enjoyable and no more repetitive than most JRPGs.  The random elements are likewise not a detraction.  You won't lose a fight due to a bad string of rolls.The voice act is excellent.  The story and characters are interesting.  The graphics and animations are worth the price of admission by themselves.  If you like JRPGs, this is a must have.  If you like the comics from years past, you will want to get this.  If you're on the fence, check out the gameplay on YouTube by SplatterCatGaming.  It's worth the $30 so far to me.  At this point, I'm already hoping for an added DLC campaign!"

I have been searching for a JRPG like this for years since Final Fantasy droped turn based combat.  The combat in this game is FANTASTIC!Art style is gorgeous, music is spot on, and the first mini boss uses dialogue straight from Star Wars.  Can't recommend it enough"
