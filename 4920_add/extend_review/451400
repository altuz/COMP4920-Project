It has elements that, if tweaked, I feel the game would be so much more enjoyable.Pro's:1) Decent story, although there is a slight pause between each dialogue startup.2) The way the resource gathering is designed is very similar to Starcraft, one of my favorite RTS games.3) The levels have a very nice looking design and they make the attempt to be different from the previous map.Con's:1) Not nearly enough units can be produced.  Starcraft and C&C 3 Tiberium Wars were so much more enjoyable to me because they allowed for a huge amount of units to be on the map at once.  This game requires you to basically expand to another mineral patch before being able to build more units.2) The maps do not let you place buildings anywhere you want.  No matter where I try to build the building space always seems to be red.  The same applies for where units can explore.  Sometimes it looks like explorable terrain but your units can't really go anywhere.3) A lot of the maps just feel like you're defending against nonstop waves of enemies that keep appearing from off the map.  It gets repetitive very fast.All in all to me some of these con's outweighed the pro's and I got bored real fast.  As such, I can't give my full recommendation that this is an enjoyable game.  But this is just my opinion so if you want to try out a decent new RTS then go for it."

There's no manual/user guide - you either have to fumble around yourself to work out how to do things or ask the (extremely friendly and helpful) community.However, having to keep pausing the game to go log a question on the forum and waiting for an answer makes this game more of a turn-based game than a RTS...It may be fun to play once you know how to play it, but... it depends how patient you are and how much of a pain you want to be by keep posting questions on game-play at the forum."
,Recommended,451400,25034402,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,Eppiox,"Meridian Squad 22 is your standard modern RTS however instead of research or set units/upgrades per map you can choose your own via a tech tree of unlockables.  By standard I mean, you build a base, train units, blow up the enemy base… or! Do a story mission controlling your unique characters.  You have food limits so you can’t just swamp the map, microing your units makes you extra powerful in this.  You can make unit compositions that work well together too.Air units are fragile but easily the best unit once you get a swarm going but cost more food than infantry.  Vehicles are slow and get blown up easy.The main story made sense and the game play was enjoyable however only about 6-7 hours long if you can micro units well.One thing that I found jarring is you cannot repair your base with another means but the main single method of repairing and keeping units alive- a command skill that is cast in an area.  This means base defences are not ideal unless you’re food capped since you need to use your heal on them instead of your army.In the last mission the AI got ‘stuck’ and was clustering units before reaching my base which let me make easy work of them (ah well).  Also the actual map for the last mission could use some work.If you’re a fan of RTS games give this a shot, I enjoyed it more than Gray Goo even though the play time is much less.Now that I’ve finished the campaign I’ll be trying some of the challenge maps."

This is little stupid I think since it is a campaign.Sometimes it looks like explorable terrain but your units can't really go anywhere.In lot of maps you just feel like you're defending against nonstop waves of enemies that keep appearing from off the map. It gets repetitive very fast.

At the time of writing this review, there are only 4 campaign missions available, but it's all really great. I can't wait to find out where the story is going. The music and sound effects also blew my mind and to me, these are easily the highlights!There's also a Conquest mode which gives you randomly generated missions to play. I can see how this could get repetitive in the long run, but for now it works really great!A thumbs up from me, I definitely recommend this game!"
,Not Recommended,451400,26711122,"Posted: 20 November, 2016",all,Selphea,"Feels like a step back from the original. Unit selection is still small, but customizability took a hit - you can't choose their armaments. Units frequently spaz out and shake from left to right while moving like they're on Ecstasy. The AI also cheats and runs on infinite resources.On to the good, there's more modes and things to do. The world of Meridian looks and sounds as amazing as ever for a one man project.Overall I'd say get the first Meridian and wait for this one to get some fixes."
76561198053767780,Not Recommended,451400,25592740,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,Anguis Furor,"The AI clearly cheats, you cannot repair your vehichles, your buildings, or heal troops except with a commander ability with a 45 second cooldown. The AI has prebuilt bases, and instant-spawning cheats apparently. So the campaign is garbage. Your only artillery is seaborne. Oh, you need to crack some turrets without naval support? Tough ♥♥♥♥ing luck. Your planes are the old wooden-canvas types. Not by technology level, by sturdiness. I know that even modern aircraft could be taken down by a single bullet, but keep in mind that hitting something that goes MACH 2 is the main defence against bullets in the aircrafts case, and if it is being stationery to be shot at (like in this game) it will be garbage (like in this game).Update:Also, would like to point out the complete and utter moronic logic behind ""short range anti-tank long range anti-infantry"" derpism. And the fact you cannot see the range of the units, until you try them out in actual combat. Or the retardness of the research system, where you have to go around and collect stuff on the map from canisters of knowledge. Like, the actual ♥♥♥♥ is that supposed to represent? Also I'm pretty fairly sure the AI-s exact carbon copy of units has either a range-buffs on them, armor buff (which you cannot see either. what a ♥♥♥♥ing coincidence) or both, because they reguraly outshoot my exacty same army composition with higher health research (which is 10 whopping percentage) for some reason. It does attempt some stuff like StarCraft, where you can set the mineral node as the rally point of your workers, but it doesn't span the workers out like in SC so they won't get in each others way, no they'll happily que in front of the single mineral node, so you'll need to manually set them up anyway. You can hotkey ONE and ONLY ONE building to a hotkey, meaning if you want multiple factories, get ready to put a ♥♥♥♥ing piano artist to shame. Also another attemt at SC stuff is the fact you can rally your factories to a fighter unit, but if you move the unit before the reinfocements arrive, the reinfocements will go the last location, will not follow the unit set as rally, as in SC, which can lead to an army scrattered across the map. And since there is no ""select all fighter units"" like in SC, you'll have to look around the map, manually send them to an RVP if you want a coherent force.Last note: I've removed this cluster♥♥♥♥ from my steam library. It does nothing but drives me mad. At least I know which devs I'll add to my ""never buy from those dip♥♥♥♥♥ again"" list."

It still amazes me that this is the work of just one man.  I have RTS games in my library that cost me three to four times as much (that were developed by teams of dozens) that are not as polished as Meridian: Squad 22 already here at early access launch.If you like RTS games with classic playstyles of base building I highly recommend this game.   For the price it is already worth the money in my book.
76561197977989409,Recommended,451400,25047640,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,Unearthed,This game is actually quite good. It plays like a classic RTS similar to Command & Conquer.  It's very fun to play and if you have played RTS games in the past then there is almost 0 learning curve. Do yourself a favor and try this game. You won't be dissapointed.8.5/10 Well worth the price!!

Trying to micro manage my armies is a pain since I can't select anyone that is not on my screen with the grouping tool without it moving me a whole two screens away. Healing your armies is much like the game ""Everyone group hug the fu&%ing commander and wait for the clock"". The story is average and exaushtingly predictable. And to top it all off, it's only trying to lick the boot of Starcraft with the resource collecting. I won't even mention that trying to collect upgrades for your armies is not unlike a spring easter egg hunt back when I was 7.Mild StoryCrappy Mechanics♥♥♥♥♥♥ clonewould rather Zurg rush the game for a easy win"
