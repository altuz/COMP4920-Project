Steam is forcing me to choose whether to recommend this or not, so I'll go with 'Yes', but with a number of caveats.It consists of 3 ""episodes"" that are fairly short in duration. All together, the episodes lasted probably 20 minutes or so for the main playthough, with you getting booted out of the episode after a set time. You can then play through an 'inspector' mode that apparently unlocks endless modes for the episodes (although the developer has indicated that they may change the flow of this).The episodes in many ways felt like a demo for the Vive, but wow, what a demo. They really show just how amazingly immersive VR can be. I've seen a number of references to others having previously seen the ""Whale Encounter"" episode and having been impressed by it, but that was by far the weakest episode (probably from having been the first one). The other two episodes allow some degree of interaction, and are just on an entirely different level of impressiveness (especially the Reef).Unfortunately, with just 3 episodes in which you really pretty much see the content in 20 minutes, I'm not sure that I can recommend it at the initial $9.99 price, but at the same time it's impressive and immersive enough that I cannot recommend against it either.Anyway, I've purchased it and it will be the first thing that I'll have others try when demoing my Vive."

I had been hesitating to do so, knowing that the amount of content that you get is very very small - especially considering that the whale encounter is free through transport. I don't regret the purchase, and won't be refunding it. You get maybe 10 minutes of total content outside of the whale experience, I didn't time it, but it wasn't a lot. It's two different scenarios, but both of them were definitely longer than the whale expeience, and just as stunning the entire time. Know going into this that you're not going to get a lot of content... but what content there is is probably the most gorgeous that exists on the vive thus far.My one complaint would be that you can't just sit in the scenarios once they end, they go to credits and you have to select them again. I really wish the devs would implement either just an automatic repeat without credits in between with an exit button, or just an environment that you could sit in because the reef migration would be an incredibly relaxing way to spend an hour meditating.EDIT: They addressed my one complaint! You now can sit it the scenarios as long as you want. Fantastic addition to an already great experience."

She didn't expect anything because I didn't tell her what will happen. She was looking away from the whale and then she heard it and turned around. She said she cried because she loved it and little bit because she was scared of the whale.On the other hand I tried to show this to my brother. He liked the first part of the Reef migration. But after a minute or so he was so bored he wanted to try some other game that has more action.Pros:+Amazing starting point to VR. First ""game"" I start to people after finishing VR Tutorial+Great visuals.+ The Luminous Abyss level. It had the biggest impact on me from all the locations.Cons:-Someone might feel that it's a little bit too short for the price.

This is the first thing I show to people who want to seeVirtual Reality for the first time, and it always blows their minds.The level of interaction in the game is somewhat minimal (some of the wildlife reacts to you touching it), but the visuals are stunningly beautiful. People always react differently to it. Some people seem to feel really happy and relaxed, and others feel totally exhilerated.If you're buying it for yourself, I think it's still worth it, especially for those who love diving, or ocean-lovers in general (I love snorkelling and the visuals in this game are akin to some of the most beautiful reefs I've seen IRL). But for those who are looking for a ""showcase"" experience to show off to friends and family, I think this should be at the top of everyone's list.Watching my parents, and better yet grand-parents become totally speechless and fully immersed in the experiecne was priceless.

It contains 3 different underwater experiences with some very basic interaction to the marine life shown in each environment. These are, The Whale Encounter (~2min), Luminous Abyss (~6min, night) and Reef Migration (~7min).These 3 mini-experiences are incredible in themselves, with highly detailed enviroments and beautiful marine life. theBlu is the very first app I will show to anyone new to VR and it always returns that ""wow"" sensation factor from young (or stubborn old) alike. And that's it, as no further content is planed to be added in the future, what you buy is just 15mins of thrill.Is it worth the high asking price? Difficult to answer that, for an app which you'll experience perhaps twice at most. As it stands and despite its very high quality production values, I could personally only recommend theBlu to be purchased on sale (unless more content is added, as more VR demonstrators are coming out to steam for free)."

One is a Reef Migration where you watch turtles, manta rays, fish do their thing as a huge swarm of jellyfish migrates across your path.  Whale Encounter brings you up close with a traveling whale. Luminous Abyss (my personal favorite) drops you into the bottom of the ocean where there is no natural light... barring a few strange aquatic animals.This is not a game but an experience; there are no goals, no points, no loss conditions. There is some interaction; you can bop jellyfish and scare off fish, for example. For the most part however you're observing and immersing yourself into the ocean.Options are limited. The Luminous Abyss episode allows you to slow down time so that you can enjoy it for longer. It also allows for screenshots. The other 2 episodes are missing these options and I'm not sure why.With that in mind, it's a very good experience and is now one of my go-tos for showing people new to VR just what it's about. The ambient music, sound effects, and movement of the environments really allow you to get sucked into it. Be warned: this is very short. Going through all 3 episodes will take roughly 20-30 minutes.  Given the $10 this may be a bit much for what is offered.Overall this a good, albeit pricey experience and is great for demonstration if you're the ""Show all my friends/family"" type."

I love the feeling of beiing present in the underwaterworld and from experience (i am a diver) i can say this almost feels like the real deal. I have a minor loading issue in one of the scenes, but i will find my way to the forums with that, as that should not be part of a review. It runs smooth as silk and with 1.6 supersampling (havent tried higher yet) it looks sharp and lively on my Rift CV1 on a 1070/Xeon OC. I can recommend this to anyone for demoing purposes and i think i will use it for my own occasional ""zen"" moment as well. Good job, looking forward to the next part! PS Devs: send me a message if you'd like me to alpha/beta test, i'd be happy to help."

TheBlu has little player interaction, you can use the wand to gently touch the creatures, but there are no grabbing allowed! You are able to slow down time and use the trackpad to take snapshots and use a flashlight to improve visibility in the Abyss.There is one bug I noticed in all 3 parts, its not game breaking, but does provide a chuckle moment (Some fishes tend to get stuck on the reef/ rocks and will continue to swim into it, you can assist them by navigating you wands and steering them in the right direction).

A week ago when I had no prior VR experience and my Vive was still somewhere in the Czech Republic I watched a youtube video of this game and thought ""well that's cool but not really that amazing."". Turns out I was wrong.This is one of these games where videos just don't do it justice. I was really really scared when this huge whale approached me and looked at me for what seemed like an eternity. My GF and my mom both totally lost their shi t when they tried it and could not look at the whale because they were so scared. My mom screamed her soul out. This game is no joke, you totally forget you are standing in your small room grinning (or screaming) like an idiot.Apart from the famous whale level there are two more which are equally amazing but much longer. I won't spoil them for you because I think part of the experience is the fact that you don't expect what's coming up next.One level, however, was very relaxing. You could interact with the water plants around you and it was a very peaceful scene. The sounds and the lighting made it even more relaxing so I just sat down on my floor and got carried away. I think there is even more potential to these relaxing levels - just imagine sitting in a nice part of the ocean for half an hour to relax until you go to bed.It is a really unique experience and one of the greatest. I will use this to show people how amazing VR can be. Thanks for making this, totally worth it."

I wouldn't really call it a game though, because the interaction is VERY limited. You can walk a little, look around 360° as you can with any VR game, nudge the ocean creatures around slightly and spook some fish when your head gets too close. The whale one was short but you'll be amazed the first time you see it come by. I found the deep water one a little terrifying the first time around, but it's pretty cool, especially at the end. The other one (I think it's called translucent or something. IDK too much VR today and I can't think) is probably the most visually stunning of the 3. There's an ambient mode too, if you want to just sit back and watch stuff float around for eternity.The whole thing is pretty short though as others have said. Rather it's worth 10 dollars or not is a subjective thing but I'd say it's worth 7.50 It would be worth 12.50 if it had a shark cage mode. If the devs did that they would be the best around, now and forever. I mean I don't regret buying it at all but some may value their their money more. I'm fine with growing my debt though to be happy. It was pretty spectacular the first time around but I'm not sure how often I'll be coming back to it. It's something I'll show to people when they want to try out VR though for sure."

Even more impressive is the way the animals will interact with the Controllers; Anemonies will close, Fish will avoid, Jellyfish can be herded etc.Additionally, the movements of each individual creature seem to be totally separate from its neighbours and there is never a time when I see a low resolution rendition morph into a higher resolution as it draws closer.Truly, I never tire of it and am never disappointed.
