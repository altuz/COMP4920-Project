76561198034820380,Recommended,451570,23440373,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,Gingergal,"I was going into this game hoping that it wasn’t just going to be a “Hector” type game that swapped out all those sexual jokes for toilet humour and I am glad to say it wasn’t like that at all (sorry Hector lovers that game was so not for me).Although the first chapter has some toilet humour and did slightly dominate plot and gameplay as the game progresses it mostly evens out and becomes a surprisingly really good, well rounded game in gameplay, plot and even humour.  It also is a good length (which is quite rare) especially if you are doing the achievements.The plot and story made it a good comic mystery adventure, usually in these type of games the story hasn’t been given much thought but here I really enjoyed it  (if it doesn’t have a good or engaging story I get bored quickly.)  Story was stronger in second half of game, as first half was mainly quest based.There was a good variety of gameplay, it had some arcade games, some puzzles, and even the inventory use wasn’t obscure but within the realms of logical use which is always good. I didn’t feel it was dialogue heavy, it was a really good balance and as there are no voiceovers you click through it fast anyway.  Although there are no voiceovers there are sound effects.  The dialogue scenes look like a visual novel, sometimes a comic strip but the other scenes that you explore just look normal.I love collectables and 3 in each scene were fun to find, they also are the hint system which I thought was good. I love second chances in Nancy Drew games and here there are deaths/screw-ups which was so much fun to try and find them all.  After each chapter the main menu will show you if you have all the deaths for that chapter and in order, so you can redo a chapter if you miss any.  These gave me so much enjoyment apart from anything else, along with some good achievements.  If you aren’t interested in them, you don’t need to do them.From just my female prospective (only speaking for me) so many comic games seem to be aimed at the teen/early 20s male with just tons of sexual innuendo and that’s about it and I can’t wait to just finish and get the game over with. While the main character here is a young male and the toilet humour is probably going to resonate more with guys (though I think toilet humour is funny if it's not overdone) it does have a broad variety of humour although it will be the toilet humour that you will remember as it is 'ew' in places.I didn’t think it got in the way of a good story, it seemed the right amount and if there was one joke I rolled my eyes with, I could easily look past it.  So I feel it’s a game that females can really enjoy as well and not just put up with some stuff (depending on your type of humour.)Cons– Only has 5 manual save game slots and an auto save slot.  I love loads of manual slots so if I miss any achievements (which I have) it minimizes replay time.-Cookie collectables were mostly pixel hunting. I don’t want them to be easy but there are loads of different ways to make collectables varied but also quite hard to find.So if you don’t mind some toilet/gross humour or can look past it for a good, fun game then I do recommend it."
,Recommended,451570,32351678,Posted: 11 June,all,haqqmisra,"Demitrios - The BIG Cynical Adventure is proof that point-and-click adventures can still be fun. Fans of the Monkey Island, King's Quest, Roger Wilco, and Sam & Max series will find a welcome trove of puzzles and sarcasm embedded in farcical narrative that might even make you laugh out loud.The mechanics show tremendous improvement over 90's era games in the genre, such that intuition is usually enough to explore each handcrafted scene. Navigation through the world is instantaneous, omitting the back-and-forth slog sometimes found in such games, with six chapters of story providing about the right length. The in-game hint system gives a balanced approach toward easing the difficulty while keeping the player from heading straight for a walkthrough. I appreciated that many of the puzzles provided a genuine challenge or at least required more than a casual glance.I played with maximum toilet humor enabled, which suffice it to say was still rather tame compared to, say, the ""South Park"" series. The whimsical plot and cast of incompatible and flawed characters reminded me of the film ""The Big Lebowski"" in its irreverent style, which is really the only way to make a game like this.Demitrios - The BIG Cynical Adventure is one of my favorite modern games in the point-and-click adventure genre. I'll certainly look forward to any others like it by this developer."

(after the first flight)- Odd pacing/execution at some points. ie:hey rando neighbor i just suddenly found out the protag actually cares about let's go to another continent with your daughter and later let's go to Germany for five seconds- Humor seemed kind of contrived. I don't think it's a matter of it being toilet humor, it's just that the jokes are...too easy. It's the opposite of witty & unexpected, yet often still manages to seem out-of-place. examples:Jokes about the protag eating things off the floor or other unusual places, jokes about farting and poop (obviously), jokes about the protag being into kinky sex or cross-dressing, jokes about the protags potential love interest not being able to cook, etc.,it's the cringey kind of humor you'd find in a lot of current American comedy films that, to me, seems desperate for a laugh.- I might get criticized myself for even saying this, especially amongst a gaming community that these days seems to want to sweep social issues under the rug, but I'll take the chance because it's still a point that needs to be criticized regardless; there is a hell of a lot of anti-Arab racism in this game. You could also possibly extend it to implied Islamophobia and western elitism as well.So the game takes you to a fake country in the MENA (middle-east/north africa) region. I'm not sure if this is stated outright but it's heavily implied seeing as it's terrain is dry and sandy and the people who live there wear cloth covering their hair (and other garb) similar to the kind seen amongst sikhs, muslims, etc. The game pokes fun at the people speaking bad english, their ""brutal"" culture and tendency to senselessly murder, and at the underdeveloped state of the country (like it having no water, the shopkeepers selling useless junk and trying to rip you off, only having one hotel/bar/museum, etc). I feel like the devs had an inkling of this being racist because despite all of the aforementioned things pointing to MENA stereotypes, they decided to make the people's skin white, as though they knew making the characters brown (in contrast to the lily-white characters they made live in france) and then going on about their poor crappy country was obviously racist.Anyway, the game comes out pretty middle-of-the-road for me. I wouldn't recommend it for anything over $5."
,Recommended,451570,23504915,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,MelBee42,"What it isA relatively long (for the genre) 'adventure' game which describes itself as like Broken Sword, but is probably more like a cross between a hidden object game and a visual novel.As a lover of classic point and clicks I was excited to play this, and although it wasn't terrible, it didn't live up to my expectations, mainly due to lack-lustre, one-dimensional characterisations and sub-par execution.The Good Stuff+ A decent length for the money+ Art style isn't bad+ Story is OK, if a little silly (which to be honest, I expect from this kind of game anyway)+ Some reasonably entertaining mini games+ Puzzles were not too difficult (perhaps a little too easy in places)+ Quite a lot to find (including hidden cookies and a lot of different ways to die)+ Devs seem active, responsive and helpful on the forums - always a plus.The Not-So-Good-Stuff- For the most part it's just static screens - you don't move your character (which reminds me more of ten-a-penny hidden object games rather than your classic point and click)- Music gets a little grating after a while as there's not a huge amount of variety- Am I supposed to even vaguely like any of the characters? The main protaganist is rude and stupid (not in a lovable kinda way), incredibly disrespectful to the woman he supposedly likes, and all round disgusting. The woman is pretty stereotypical (she wants to buy all the crappy looking stuff the mechant has, because gosh, she just loves shopping *that* much!) and the kid is deliberately annoying- The humour misses the mark more than it hits it. If I tell you one of the characters is called 'Dumgivafuk' I think I've probably given you the level of wit here in a nutshell- I realise it's not a game with a huge budget (and the price tag reflects that) but I feel like some voice acting - even if only in parts - really would have brought this game to life a little moreConclusionJust because your game is set in multiple countries/cities does not make it 'like Broken Sword'. It's nothing like Broken Sword. That said, it was a moderately entertaining diversion and I do appreciate the effort they've put into it. I've played far worse.5 'mehs' and a shrug out of 10."
,Not Recommended,451570,24448852,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,Idunhaël,"- Re ""cynical"": I still don't know why the subttile. The only thing I could think of is the developers being cynical about their own view of adventure games.- I think, having played those really old adventure games like Space Quest and Monkey Island and so on that adventures need to have humour. This game does not.- All characters are equally unlikable and as cliché as characters can be (sexist dude, dumb blonde, spoiled brat, dirty arab merchant, etc). Perhaps that counts as humour in France. It would certainly explain some things.- The characters are also ugly. Which is strange considering the background graphics look fine.- It's not a real adventure as in your character walks around on screen doing things. It's more a point-and-click puzzle type game with static NPCs from a FP perspective.- A lot of NPC deaths. Again, death isn't really that funny. Nor was it in most cases needed to drive the story forwards.+ There were some minigames that were all right. Not too easy, not too hard.+ Scenery graphics were okay."
76561198168259630,Recommended,451570,29346798,Posted: 18 January,all,Emily the Strange,"6.5/10 A slightly Deponia-esque game in that the character's personality is based off of the same basic stereotype, but Deponia is much more complex and elaborate. This can be played in a couple of days (one day if you really wanted to). If you have the sense of humor of a junior high boy, the toilet humor will NOT be lost on you (it definitely wasn't lost on me). If you happen not to have that sense of humor, you have the option to turn off the toilet humor. Nearly all of the puzzles were incredibly easy, but there were times that it became frustrating because I would do the same exact thing a few times, only to have it work and magically be ""solved"" the third time around or so because I clicked in a *slightly* different place. It was overall an enjoyable game, and it's worth playing just for the adventure and humor.Because the game doesn't have a rating, I normally rate them myself, and do my best to remain as close to the ESRB rating system as possible.MATURE: Sexual Themes and Dialogue, Language, and Violence"

I wouldn't say it's the best game out there, but the level of toilet humor was enough on the main character to make me chuckle such as it was in games like Deponia and Randall's Monday.  The cookie system was helpful and made it more fun I felt with all the different ways to kill off your character.  After two playthroughs I was able to get all the achievements."

Humour could only be described as sad - and I'm not actually talking about the toilet 'jokes' but the rest of the  sorry tale. As a point and click game it had some decent puzzles and can be best described as a fifth rate Broken Sword, bless it's little soul, it did its best. But that child - please rewrite the game and allow me to handcuff her, put her in a suitcase and throw her out of a plane in mid flight. Ican only say I wish Steam would stop offering us these weak games that look like they are produced in a spotty adolescent's bedroom, offer us something professional and actually test them out beforehand."

Poop, fart, boob,♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes abound which are playfully scattered throughout the game, but what makes this fun is the main lead who is a hapless guy who tries to solve a mystery of his burglary of a bird statue and how he stumbles on through until the end. The mood is light, hilarious lines of dialogue (no voice acting, which will get your mouse-clicking finger working out), and great puzzles that, for the most part, make sense. The achievements are very rewarding when you get them and enourages a few playthroughs to get em all. Big thumbs up for this game and I hope to see more from this bunch in the near future :)"

I didn't find a lot of humor in the dialogue--perhaps it was a little TOO mean spirited, even for me. However, I did enjoy the story (such as it was). Not a complete waste of time, but not an essential adventure, either. Recommendation is for hardcore adventure fans who need a fix but not for anybody looking for something more than okayish."
