You will play for hours trying to unlock the perfect attachments.• Developer Engagement: 10/10Could not be happier with the responsiveness and level of involvement from a group of developers. They are present and genuine in their game's fourums. It shows that they care about their work and are willing to double down to fix things when necessary.The weapons are few, but they are well designed and work well together.The perks system is already very well though out with certain perk combinations only revealing themselves after playing each class for a significant amount of time."

A complex power up system that is very easy to adapt to your play style. The higher difficulties are very punishing too. Just seems more than your regular shooter - certainly the best one I've played on steam. At this price, it's a steal. If you like shoot em ups, buy it without hesitation!"

(But this is my notes so far:) I felt this was important to show to my friends in light of another very recent shoot-em-up review for a game I do not recommend and will not name here.Pros-Classic arcade style gameplay. One hit kills you (sometimes this would be bad IMO, but this game pulls it off:).-Absolutely gorgeous, at least on the highest graphics settings. (See my final bad point.)-Music which sets the atmosphere nicely. Traditional sci-fi classical music in the beginning, up-beat electronic music for intense battles (which seems to very in intensity along with te enemy attack waves), spooky ambience for desolate planet mission, well, you get the idea.-Skippable intro (which is pretty high quality)-Fair combat patterns, few if any 'cheap shots' from enemies. (except for hard survival mode)-Challenging but possible. A bit easier than an actual arcade game. But even on easy levels it keeps you on your toes.-Unique level features to eliminate monotony.-Non-linear progression for varying difficulty(campaign mode)-Dialogue which reflects your performance on completion of the level and reinforces the character.-Grinding for unlocks does not seem to be a chore at all, more of a bonus really as you will unlock the best ones in the first few hours of gameplay anyway. (The 1 million kills achivement could take a while though:)-Massive carnage. The game relys on ""streaks"" where kills add up until an enemy leaves the screen. On some levels you can get this number into the thousands.-Bullet hell minus the bullets. Instead of lots of projectiles, this game throws hundreds of thousands of small enemies for you to kill or avoid. although there are still quite a few enemies who do shoot.-Disabling malfuncioning machines seems to me to be much more ethical than killing invading aliens or even other humans. So therefore anyone who has any kind of moral objetion to violence, war or murder really has no beef here.-And I could probably add a few more minor points too...Cons-Some unskippable in-game cutscenes, sometimes going for more than 30 seconds. Particularly annoying at one point in the hard campaign where the player has a choice of two levels which both feature this.-Hard levels often far easier than medium levels.-Vertical survival seems to be largely dependent on luck (mainly energy drops), but also a few cheap shots.-Menus seemed a little tricky to navigate with the controller sometimes. Particularly the attachments and graphics settings screens.-""Kills"" is the term the game uses for destroying the enemy machines. Maybe they could have chosen a better word. (but as you can see I am struggling to find much wrong with it now:)and finally...-This is the only game where I have experienced slowdown on my Steam Machine. Now it is only occasional, and I just have to restart the game and it's fixed, but still it's surprising that what should be such a simple concept to execute takes up so much system resources that it slows down at all. You may find that you are forced to suffer one of the lesser quality options to get this running on your hardware. And anything less than the highest quality can look a bit poor in places, so deduct 0.4 from my score if you think your machine isn't as capable as a 4th generation Steam Machine.Perhaps not the greatest shooter I've ever played(that honour goes to the IMO underrated Disposable Hero for the Amiga and CD32:). But it is the best of all the similar games I have purchased in recent months. And worthy of a solid nine out of ten. 9.0/10"

So much so, that I wrote my very first review.  Want a ship that fires volleys of rockets?  You can do that.  Oh, you want heat seeking missles?  Well here you go.  Lasers, plasma, drones: they are all customizable.  The amount of combinations (especially after you get Battle Pods) of weapons and modules is staggering.  Full controller support and two player shared screen make this AWESOME FOR COUCH CO-OP!!  Truely a gem for the $8 price tag.To the developers:  I would love to see a better way to check out your ships weapons before you start a game.  It could be quicker to check out new combos in a garage or practice area.  Or ""click this button to see what your guns look like"".  Or even a little window.  Not that the game takes long to load or anything, just that quitting and going back through the menu when you dont like your gun can be rough two player, or if you are already a couple levels into the campaign.  Aslo, it would be convenient if you could have a couple of slots to save ship designs.  This would make it easier to compare ships and their damage output.  Thank you for making this game.  Keep up the good work!"

,Recommended,451600,28356759,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,BoneChill,"This game caught my eye on the steam store for just $7.99 USD.  It has provided more enjoyment than some titles that have cost $49.99 or more.  Especially with a friend or 2, this game has great potential for hours of fun!  Graphics are pretty good, enemy difficulty is pretty balanced requiring some serious dilligence on certain levels, weapons look pretty nice, lots of different attachments can alter the weapons, and the gameplay is responsive and smooth with little functionality issues.  I do feel in some areas that the game excels in, it also struggles with.  For instance, I enjoy the amount of attachments there are to choose from, but a lot of the attachments counter or cancel eachother out, or they are just useless in most scenarios.  I would create some sort of tier system for the attachments - for instance you could easily put the +10% chance to dodge enemies/projectiles on a low tier and the +30% chance to dodge enemies/projectiles on the high tier.  I understand this isn't really applicable to all attachments as some of them are unique skill bonuses, but if not a tier system, a color scheme could be used to coordinate which attachments upgrade which feature of your plane.  I also think the Ultimate system needs to be tweaked for a lot of the planes.  Certain aircraft feel far more powerful than others due to their ultimate.  Biff is one example.  His ultimate obliterates anything directly in front of it (all enemies & projectiles) like a Ryu super and stays active for around 5 seconds.  Now compare that to almost any of the other aircraft each with their unique ability, and its night and day how much more useful it is than most others (in my limited experience).  The only thing that gives me hope for other aircraft getting highest of marks, is that there are some players listed on the World Rankings that use non-Biff planes.  Maybe I'll unlock some crazy attachments soon that will allow me to use those other planes more effectively.  Keep in mind I have beaten the game through a few different paths on my own and with a friend.  We have been doing mostly Hard now, but I still can't seem to get some of the good attachments that he has.  Oh well, guess that gives me something else to strive for :P   If you liked the arcade series called Raiden back in the day, you'll probably enjoy this game as I do.  Cheers!**To be noted, I play using my wireless Xbox One controller and it works well - flawlessly in combat (which is what matters right!?), but not so flawlessly out of combat - there are a few Menu highlighting bugs occuring with the controller that don't occur with the mouse.  Using the mouse to navigate through the Menu is much more accurate and does not cause the same 'sticking' issues as seen with controller.  A friend of mine sees the same issues (throughout all Menu navigation) with an Xbox 360 controller.  Highly preferred the controller over m&kb in game.**Also adding, I am pretty torn between the fact that there is no Continue option.  I didn't like it at first, because some levels are ridiculously difficult, maybe there's no scaling for 1-4 players?  It CAN be done solo on hard, because you get far more power ups and on bomb levels (these 360 degree air-mines) you can cease fire or use ulti's more efficiently to absorb projectiles.  I haven't noticed any difference between difficulty tho for 1 person or 2.. Maybe at 3 or 4 in a group, the levels become easier?  That is yet to be seen, which leads me to my next bit of feedback.. The Online Lobby system.. Worked fine Hosting/Joining and then telling my friend what the Lobby name was, but other than that it was really bland.  For one, I think the search results should post all active games not just open lobbies.  Or one step further, if there are no active games, post the most recently completed full games, and maybe stage difficulties could be given a value like Easy=1, Medium=2, Hard=3, that way you could gage the difficulty of the path the player took!  Another idea (for the future), it would be interesting if there were 2 modes, one ""Open"" Lobby or Room where players could freely join at any point yet the Creator has admin type priveleges (ie: able to kick/block that player if rude or below expected skill lvl), and the other mode could be a ""Ranked"" Lobby or Room where players must join at the beginning, also being the only mode that has a posted Rank system or Leaderboard.  Also, for that Leaderboard, it would be interesting to see a Solo, 2-man, 3-man, 4-man separate Leaderboard, and/or make it filterable per Pilot/Aircraft."

""Weapon conversions are what your ship will shoot and the same type of conversions combine. This means you can experiment with different combinations every time you play.At the time of writing this review there is 294 Attachments and more are being added regularly.Game Features-Able to combine attachments into interesting combinations-Different difficulties-Save feature for easier difficulties-Local and Online Multiplayer-""Staging area"" where you can see your DPS and test combinations-Survival modes-Lots of attachments to unlockI also really like the developer, They listen to feedback and add features that people request.

Even with the lag, however, there is no penalty for being off host, if you can't find a server, the game is still great fun!The game is an absolute blast to play with a good group of friends, and the level select, difficulty and unlock system gives a solid amount of replay value for the price."

,Recommended,451600,30226187,Posted: 27 February,all,JBRPG,"Even though the game still needs to be polished up before the Fall 2017 ""final"" release, I somehow keep coming back to it again and again in hopes of trying out new combos of weapon adjustments. If you like a shooting game that has lots of weapon options anc can stand a huge enemy horde that really stops you in the later levels, than this game is for you at Early Access.Things I like about the gameSeems to be strongly inspired by Gradius in terms of power-up choice since it adds to the idea of tactical choicesBranching difficulty allows anyone to tackle through the game for a story or for becoming a completionistThe Modular weapon add-on unlock gives incentive to make the best combo to destroy as many enemies on screen as it is the case in many SHMUPsThings that need improvementBetter enemy placement to compensate the smooth framerate of 60 or 30fps and to reduce the overall chance of ""cheap death"" by reducing the amount of enemies but still feel like plenty are coming.More optimized collision detection and item destruction. I noticed that when there are levels that throw huge hordes of 3d model enemies and particle bullets, the framerate does not recover fast enough that even scenes that do not contain lots of enemies after a huge wave due to a problem on how the game handles enemies being destroyed / object pooled.Gamepad controls for menu needs to be consistent and simplfied since there is not a single button that actually does one basic action (accept menu item & cancel menu item).Mouse and gamepad controls need to be EXCLUSIVE, as in they should not be together when the gamepad is plugged in.Survival modes could benefit from procedural generation of enemy waves since the current build seems to stack up enemy waves without changing the flow.Pay close attention to the player color shots against the background color to improve contrast. For example, I noticed in Cloud Nine that using the white ship really makes it impossible to see the bullets hitting enemies against the bright white clouds. Either make the clouds darker or give the player color shots a darker grey.Show a preview of the attachments in action during player select mode.I do have faith that the game will get better, but it is up to your team, with strong passion and commitment, to improve the game with the given feedback so more people can enjoy the final product on launch date."

The secondary beam that fires when you relase the trigger, combined with the faster firing after a pause is a nice idea and requires some practice to use.The graphics are good, could be better, but with all the action going on... it is not really needed.I only had one problem, I didn't notice I had to change the mission to keep playing easy and was wondering why the difficulty jump was so extreme. Once I figured that out I played through on easy...I have to say, medium seems an excessive difficulty jump from easy.

Graphics wise its on par, nothing special but good enough for 2017 and in competion to others in the same category they all look cartoony in comparison.  Gameplay wise it shines.. so much replayability, unlocks and just one more go is said often. The local multi player is great... we often play 3 players all on xb1 controllers. The customisability is so wide, playing 3 players we are all set up differently with different characters and in a way can compliment each other. I would say easily best shmup on steam by far and its still in pre release. Developers monitor the forums and listen to the players."

They've combined ideas from many of the great old shmups and crammed em into one game. Similar to UN Squadron and Aero Fighters you can take your pick of a pilot/ship that each have their own specialties and abilities. However, the selling point for me is the power up system which gives a big nod to the Gradius games. Gradius III is my favorite shoot em up of all freakin time, and I really love how they incorporated their love of it into the game. The controls are tight and the weapons feel great! Some pilots are better than others, but I'm sure they will balance things out and of course it depends on your style of play.As far as devs go, I've had one issue with the game and the devs answered quickly and are looking into it. They seem to really care about the game they've made and listen to the players. Thumbs up to Relative!If you like shoot em ups, especially Gradius, then I can't recommend this one enough.

Why it doesn't save it, I don't know, but this could be easily fixed.- The music is absolutely dreadful. Rather than all the elaborate, escapable torture and execution devices that James Bond frequently encounters, the Bond villains should wise up and just play the sound track of this game to Bond for a couple of minutes - you won't be able to shut him up after that. It sounds like the sort of sound track created by a talentless art student, whose friends have to lie to him about how great his ""music"" sounds in order to spare his feelings. It's not far off of Ross Geller's musical career in Friends if you've seen it. You WILL be turning that♥♥♥♥♥♥off, mark my words. Thing is in a game like this you really need music to keep the pace. Let's hope this is a stop gap while in early access for the sake of our sanity.- Most of the upgrades are just plain terrible. You collect orbs just like in Gradius to upgrade your ship. You collect permanent items which alter your abilities. They suck. I have a dozen of them unlocked but don't use any as they are detrimental to gameplay.- No option to save. I know it's not usual to have that in a game like this but the map is quite large and having to start from the beginning each time you load up the game might get on some people's nerves.Aside from those annoyances, great game.

Its great fun with friends, requires teamwork, communication, and offers diffrent types of gameplay to test and have fun with. The 8 player coop online is crazy fun and i cant get enough of it! One feature that is still missing but is easy to deal with is the lack of a save button for online play. I understand this is going to be added but if you look at each mission, you can earn many parts off the same mission so playing the mission over and over again actualy yelds some rewards still. There are many ships to choose from. Each with there own set of abilities, superpowers, etc... Bugs seem limited but there are still some you will run in to time to time. Nothing game crushing so far that i have found. This is the kind of game where if you all die you just pause for a second and say something along the lines of ""mission failed! we'll get'em next time!"" Because of being able to have so many friends on the field at once the gameplay changes based on what the other players choose. Each outcome will totaly change your thoughts on how you want to tackle a level. All in all i rate this game at a 8.5/10. The reason is that i know there is much more this game will provide as it developes in to full release. If you bought it now you would not be dissapointed. One thing i didnt mention is that if you play it by yourself. There is in fact a save button. So die and test all you want on how you want to complete your campain!"
