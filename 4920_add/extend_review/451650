This is especially impressive because it's being written by a single person in his (or her, I'm not sure) spare time rather than being written by a team at a corporation.It takes a little bit of playing around to get used to it (it took me maybe 10 minutes), but it is simple rather than complicated so it's not like there are a ton of controls to memorize. I was skeptical about downloading any third party video playing software at first, since it already cost so much just to get the Vive, and there was a competitor product that I was thinking about getting (and have since also purchased), but I decided to buy this one and test it out anyway and I am happy with my decision. One other major piece of information about this is that I had to download other software, as provided on the Whirligig download page, but it was easy to download and set up.I go back and forth between using Whirligig and the other product to view videos in VR because each one offers the base ability to play videos, but each also offers some things that the other doesn't (plus, the other one crashes upon loading certain videos, and I'm still not sure why.

I have tried many other video apps for VR and i can say for sure, this is the BEST of them all. I mean other apps have features and backgrounds that maybe appealing but the overall product isn't that great. For example, Cinevo has terrible UI, probably the worst I ever seen in a program as far as making it user friendly but its got neat environment like the Ocean. BigScreen is by far my favorite until i stumbled upon Whirligig.  It's got nice feature like dragging the screen and placing it anywhere in the space but it is lacking environments and many other 360 features.  Oculus Videos is nice with its video thumbnails and many neat environments but again lacking options and feel static.Whirligig big cinema screen feel great...it looks theatrical....it can be curved, resize, stretch.  I feel like I am watching from a truly big cinema screen.  You can save the screen settings and videos can be saved and load up in 6 different slots...i wish there are more slots available to save videos and i hope they incorporate thumbnails in place of those slots.  Videos can be viewable in 360, up and under, sbs...it's got all covered.  Additional environments are neat...like the bed room which is my favorite.  You really feel like you're inside the room.  However, i feel that the lighting isn't dynamic and feels a bit off.  The drive-in theater is neat but the screen is a bit too far.  I hope they come out with a theater environment and make you really feel like sitting in the theater.  Cinevo theater environments don't impressed me much but i do like its Ocean environment with moving boat and birds flying, i wish Whirligig will incoporate that sort of environments in additional to a theater one.  The most impressive thing about Whirligig is its UI and the many options and they all can be controlled with Vive's controllers.  It utilizes one controller as menu while having the other one point at it for selection...pretty neat thought...similar to TiltBrush's UI.  This will be my go-to app as far as watching videos for now.  I have no regret buying this app and can't wait to see what features and improvements will be added."

The playback options are easy to configure and there's a wide range of them, so you can get videos exactly right. Because 3D video is still a bit niche you will have to install the recommended codec pack to make a lot of videos work, but the instructions are provided to make that as simple as possible. (To be fair, this is because those codecs just don't ship with OSes yet. As a rule of thumb, if your video plays on the desktop, it'll play in Whirlgig.)I used the free version of Whirlgig when I first got my Rift. I decided to get the Steam version just for the neatness of installation and it's been well worth if for the price of a pint. I haven't had any problems whatsoever, and the updates keep coming.

Unlike some of the other media players this one has extensive support for high resolution videos with a large array of VR playback modes. As of now Whirligig is very much in its alpha state. The experience at the beginning was rather confusing; the UI is clunky and the controllers of the HTC Vive only have access to some basic options. It's impossible to access crucial options such as combining vertical/horizontal split video's without using the keyboard. As far as I could find there is also no option to save the last used settings for a specific video, a headache-inducing process when you have many different types of videos. I also experienced some problems with the codecs as my pre-installed LAV codecs weren't recognized, this can quickly be resolved by using the installer from the website.The video playback seems to keep a constant frame rate even with 4k videos, I do not see any significant loss of quality.If you are unable to find a compatible media player for your VR or 360 video's I suggest first trying out the trial version on the website and test if it works for you.

I don't know why or how this happened, I didn't know how to stop it, and I couldn't recreate the process. I actually previously had an earlier free version of whirligig and had absolutely no trouble playing videos on that, but that was before this explorer software. Now, I frankly just don't get it.My expectation is to use the file manager to find the video and launch the video. This does not happen. If I can figure out how to make a video launch, I may change my vote, but for now, I can't recommend this software.edit 1: After closing and re-opening the application, I was able to find and play some videos using the method described above. If you switch too rapidly between videos or select the wrong one (knowing why one is wrong and another isn't, when both are MP4, is basically impossible), it will cause the application the semi-crash, and no videos will play. Once you close and re-open the application, videos will play again.Again, this is just way too buggy to recommend."

Of course the first thing I wanted to do when I got my Vive was to look at some of my images and explore what others are doing with 360º stereoscopic video.After over a week of banging my head against the wall with ""Virtual Desktop"" and still being unable to watch any videos or have any reasonable control over 3D stills I decided to give Whirligig a try.   Five minutes later I was enjoying a few stereoscopic 360º videos from Youtube and experimenting with my own 3D stills.    What's brilliant about Whirligig is that no matter how you set the stereoscopic options the controller is still easy to see and work with.   As soon as you select ""side-by-side"" mode in that other app the display becomes completely garbled and the only way you're going to change anything is by taking off your HMD and typing on your keyboard.    This is one of the best purchases I've made for my Vive."

I was greeted by some confusing, distorted images, including an image showing what the controls were for the program on an XBox controller, which was discouraging as I was trying to use Vive controllers.I gave up fairly quickly, but later came back to give it another go. On my third or fourth attempt at using the program, I finally figured it out and my view quickly changed from seeing it as a badly broken program, to actually being a very good video player. Although it plays 2D videos perfectly well, it has a heavier focus on supporting 3D videos, which is a wise choice as watching 2D videos is still a more pleasant experience on a flat screen than on a VR headset.My initial impulse was to use the trackpad on the Vive controller to navigate the menus, pretty much as I would use a TV remote to navigate menus on a TV. Doing so gave some very weird results. It would just keep scrolling up through the menu options, instead of just going up one options as I expected.Things became much easier once I figured out several things: the menu was actually much more easily navigated using the 'laser pointer' coming out from one of the Vive controllers, the ""<<<<"" and "">>>>"" were both actually singular left and right buttons, and that the ""<<<<"" and "">>>>"" buttons were best triggered by pointing at them with the laser pointer and using the Vive controller's trigger button. After that, I also figured out that there were controls that showed up on the other controller when looking at the controller through the headset (and that if you turned that controller upside-down, there were a couple more options). Those options also were used by using the laser pointer/trigger button on them.Once I started figuring out the controls, I started to figure out the menu options. They offered some quite nice features, such as setting how far the 'screen' is from you, what angle (up or down) you want it to be, whether you want a curved screen, and more.Although it's not always entirely clear, make sure you take a look at, and are aware of the pdf manual that is on the Store page (or if you purchase Whirligig, it's also on the right side of the Library page for Whirligig).I really, really hope that the developer creates a couple minute tutorial on how to use Whirligig on the Vive, and has that play at the beginning of first use of the program on the Vive.I also definitely look forward to UI refinements in the future (and it is Early Access at the moment anyway).Although this VR video player has a number of rough edges that you immediately run into, at it's core, it's an excellent video player if you can work past those rough edges."

I definitely want to continue using Whirligig, but I hope that later builds won't break it again. Reading the blog, I see that the developer no longer wants to bundle the codecs with the installation anymore and wants the user to download the codecs themselves. This is usually fine, except this seems to cause more headaches for the user when it doesn't work.

This video player has improved massively since then.  The interface is revolutionary and very well thought out once you understand it and it doesn't take long to figure it out. A massive range of video playback options for all types of video from 180 to 360 in 2d or 3d.  You can play regular 2d and 3d movie on a selection of different 3d environment rooms. A bedroom, drive in movie, living room and small theater or you can display the video on a large floating screen.Playback is very smooth when you switch whirligig to the fastest codec option.A supersampling slider is also featured in the floating options panel.There is no better all-round vr video player.Highly recommended."

Version 4.0 effectively makes this the ULTIMATE VR player. It runs great, has a ton of well implemented features and it is the benchmark for all other players. One of the great features you may overlook because it is so elegantly implemented, is capturing of the mouse and bringing the window back in front when you start using the hs again.So many players do it wrong and I am a developer and I know it has required a lot of effort to get a VR player to this highly matured and excellent state.

,Recommended,451650,34718020,Posted: 3 September,all,Fenrisfil,"TLDR: Whirligig is really good but quite unstable. If it was priced higher I wouldn't recommend it, but it is cheap and when it isn't being buggy/crashing it is simply the best VR video player out there.Positives----------1) It supports every format you are ever likely to need including 3D and 360.2) It's packed with features giving you maximum flexibility in how you want to view your videos. If you like to lie on the floor and stare at the ceiling surrounded by nothing but darkness, you can. If you prefer to sit in a virtual drive in and watch a movie on a huge screen in front of you, you can too.Negatives----------1) The control system for the menu's regularly flip out preventing you from selecting anything. Usually the only solution is to quit and restart.2) Sometimes (far too often) the program will simply crash forcing you to go back and start again.These instability issues are a problem, but you rarely crash once you are set up (i.e. If you stop fiddling with things/changing videos it'll stay stable) and so they don't stop you using the player. Despite the problems I still find myself going back to this player again and again and I'm yet to find a superior alternative."
