,Recommended,451760,23705432,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DOOOOO,"Between otaku-pandering Japanese productions and amateur OEL wannabes, there's a lot of trash in the visual novel genre. Plenty of gems, too, but wading through the refuse to find one is an art in itself.Highway Blossomsis one of those exceptions.That's not say it's a revelation. Outside the American Southwest setting,Highway Blossomsis little more than an average coming-of-age romance meets road film starring two young women, each with their own complementary personalities and existential crises -- time-tested cliches at their best.But that doesn't make it any less compelling. What it lacks in novelty,Highway Blossomsmore than makes up for it with romantic charm and superb tact, filled to the brim with saccharine ups and heart-wrenching downs that hit in all the right places but never once feel out of place; even the H scenes impress, the subtlety and tenderness unexpected coming from a lesbian romance written by two men.The art is by all means above-average for an OEL novel, but for me, aesthetically out of place. A more realistic sense of stylization with just a pinch of East Asian flair would have worked better given the heavy Americana vibe, something the original score captures perfectly -- dusty guitars and contemplative minimalism serve as the ideal mood setters, arguably the biggest highlight to be found here.Then again, I'm a sucker for a good love story, and that's exactly whatHighway Blossomsdoes best: touching romantic exposition via mixed media and an excellent reminder as to why I enjoy this genre in the first place."

76561198065334147,Recommended,451760,23625884,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,Maxbox,"First review and I don't really know how people do this so....*Grammar is awful get over it*TL;DR I don't know if it's worth 10 bucks but, It's pretty good. If you just want to relax and zone out to a game, this does the trick.I have not yet finished the game. I'm a little over 6 hours in and, I'm writing this as if I'm in the future and have finished the game. I'll put some edits at the bottom to fix stuff as I complete the game.Overall: This game ended up being pretty ok. I mean the story isn't going to win any awards (no offence), but the characters made the story enjoyable. It was a little slow at times but, durring treasure hunts the pace would pick up, and I'd find myself spam clicking through the scenes to see what would happen. The game so far <-------(I actually haven't finished it yet) is on a steady course gathering steam as I feel♥♥♥♥♥♥will probably go down soon. If you do want to buy this game, I'd say wait until some more reviews come out as, I don't know If I can accurately give you a decent rating on it overall.Art: ""9/10"" The art was wayyyy better than I thought it would be, I mean I thought this game would be a long shot but it ended up looking better than a lot of the huge publisher Japanese stuff, which is a feat in itself coming from a prettymuch no-name studio (with like 5 people working on it). The art was good however, it lacked in quantity. The backdrops were very well drawn however when like 90% of your scenes are in a motorhome you'd think they would have some angles that allowed you to see the backdrop outside of the vehicle more, instead you get a bunch of detailed shots of the inside of an old motorhome. (Of course driving through the desert there probably wouldn't be much to look at anyway) I say the art's a solid 9/10. Not as much as I wanted but, what was there was good.Story: ""6/10"" I'll be honest I had to force myself to click through some of this game the reason being, it lacked depth. I mean the game is tagged casual, which fits it perfectly however, I find myself wishing it had a more powerful story. It's the kind of story that would make for a great short animated series however, having to read it all out takes away from the cutness of the driving in an RV for hours. The story starts to pick up an hour or two in, and grows more and more enjoyable as it goes on. I did find myself having to take a break every once and a while though, I wasn't expecting this to be a huge page turner. FIX: (It gets a lot more dramatic in the second half)What else is there?Characters: ""7/10"" The characters are unique and refreshing throughout the story. Not crazy deep but, I didn't want deep characters in a game like this. They fit well and I don't think there's much more to say.Sound: ""7/10"" I wrote sound, but what I really mean is the music. If you didn't know this game has no naration; I didn't know but I also didn't read the discription. Again with the whole ""it worked pretty well thing."" I feel like this vn would be pretty weird if there was voice acting. It's written in a more western style, and good english speaking voice actors are hard to come by. I'm glad they didn't throw some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting into the mix.Music: ""7/10"" The music worked well with most of the scenes though, some could use a change of pace. The songs would occasionally die out and then not start up for a few min which left it feeling empty, if that makes sense.I'm sure there's some other things but this has already gone way longer than I had planned so I'm ending it here.Semi-Final verdict: 11/10 ""it's ok""EDIT: I forgot to mention this game says it's yuri and.. that's like sorta true but you need to patch it to get the extra content/dlc bonus ecchi♥♥♥♥♥♥ whatever you want to call it ya pervs. This is steam afterall.EDIT #2: It did pick up in the second half. Much dramas happend and it's longer than I thought it would be. So far I would give this game a solid 7/10 but, I've been known for giving high scores so take it with cup of salt. OH more yuri stuff happend in the second half, like a lot more. I don't really know how to feel after playing this game but, if the discription catches your eye, I'd check it out. Two thumbs up!EDIT #3: I'll post the actual final verdict once I finish the damn thing."

,Recommended,451760,23642722,"Posted: 18 June, 2016",all,Ben is Zero,"The store page said this game took 6 hours to beat, and I did it in exactly that (With the adult patch installed) and did so in a single sitting. I was hooked to this VN from start to finish, and while that could be because the characters look, act and feel exactly like my relationship, I'm pretty sure it's because it's a great bundle of fun.It might not be the longest, but it all fits together incredibly well. The graphics/aesthetics are beautiful and fit together really well, the soundtrack, while slightly irritating to start, quickly became very fitting, and the entire thing was amazing. It was well polished, and I only found two typos in the entire thing. All but one of the side characters had sprites too, which I really liked (whereas longer games such as IMHHW and Everlasting Summer didn't have) and so I feel this game was truly loved - and it makes you love it too.There are no choices, however, it is a linear VN, so that's worth noting (There is no actual gameplay). With the story, there was a good half an hour where I thought ""This is a bit odd"" but I can't complain because it's plausible - the characters could fit that scenario, so it's all good. There is alsono gallery(There is now a gallery)or jump options on the menu, so if you wanna skip through it to replay certain bits and such, then you can't really, though the skip option is very quick, and the easy way to scroll through previously read scenes is very nice. It would have been nice if there was a better way to understand the keys, (like middle mouse button to hide the ui and see the picture, and V activating text to speech). But honestly these things don't matter to me. Just click, appreicate, and play the whole thing!The story is mostly about their cute/sweet relationship, and not really about the gold rush thing. I mean, thats a huge thing, but it's not so much of a challenge, but the situation for our plot to be told. The relationship story is very sweet, and there are some good references and funny moments.A couple achievements involving settings didn't popup until I looked at the gallery after beating the game, but that was not an issue really - since anyone hunting for achievements would beat the game.This is really just a very relatable, very sweet, very cute, and very polished yuri VN, of moderate length, and it's definitely worth it's price.For those questioning the adult content, it wasn't much, it wasn't forced, and it complimented the story very well, though I think you'd be okay without it too if you're disgusted by that sort of thing. It's not too intense though, but enjoyable none the less :^ )The relationship development didn't seem stretched, I think it was realisitic, and not obvious that it would happen from the start. As opposed to everything pushing them together like this is a Hollywood romcom or something, things aren't always perfect for them, and just hnng.Gosh, I really don't know what to say at this point, everything I've said sounds like a criticism but I honestly can't think of more flaws other than what I have said. If those won't bother you, buy this! It's excellent!!I'd ditch my cs:go team again should there be a sequel!"

,Recommended,451760,29911563,Posted: 13 February,all,tenshi_a,"I was gifted this game by a friend of mine, and I don't think she knew, but it was incredibly appropriate as it was mere months since my dad passed away suddenly, leaving a hole in my life, and the lives of my immediate family. And he did seem to talk more - and more freely - while driving than any other time, and he did seem to often communicate through the weird obscure music he played in his car more than he did through words.So... gifting this game to me was really appropriate. I think... unknowingly so.And this game really helped, but... not so much in the form of ""I know what Amber is going through"", since - well, that's utterly no use to me other to know it doesn't lead to anything good - but in the form of ""just plain helping out with stuff is one thing, but I really need to wake up and play the Marina role to try and bring my suffering, grieving family out of gloom"". And you know... it kind of worked.Thumbs up to this game for inspiration, even if I feel like it didn't intend to be.But, more of a review for the actual game - it's alright! It's an odd little VN which is half treasure hunting, rivalry and tourism, and then half romance, grieving and angst. Though the first half does naturally flow into the other, and there is crossover, it definitely feels like it's split down the middle, and that the first half ended kind of abruptly.As you might have gathered, I thought the amount of detail to the characters was pretty good, though I might place more into the two main characters than other readers due to my personal connection. I also really appreciated the trio of rival characters, they were fun.I quite enjoyed the tourism - I'm not from the US so other than the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas it's just ""oh hey it's that place I've seen on TV. It has a name?!"" So I ended up googling for images of the places they went to, and that was fun. I do feel like a game with such emphasis on actual places should have used more background images - detailed ones - to convey the majesty of the locations covered, because it was quite central to the game. That's not to say that there were hardly any, it is to say that it could have done with more since it was all about sharing the experience.The rivalry, the romance, the treasure hunting, the grieving and angst... I also thought were good, though I think some parts near the end could have been handled a little better. I think I'd venture into major spoilers if I tried to explain.Overall, though, it's good and I recommend this kinetic VN."

,Recommended,451760,25158652,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,angelwolfchild,"I love these developers. No seriously I want to sit down and have a drink with these people, because if they are even half as much fun in real life as in this game it’s going to be a blast.Highway Blossoms is a very enjoyable yuri kinetic novel about two girls meeting in the desert and going to search for treasure. The story is very simple but well written, with a decent pace and a great sense of humour. The treasure hunt itself is more of a plot device than the main focus, which might be disappointing to anyone who was expecting more of an in-depth gold-rush adventure, but honestly the story is charming enough that it wasn't a concern for me. Alot of that came from the relationship between our two main characters. Amber is a very likeable protagonist even at her worst moments (and those breakfast puns she pulls out would make Sans very proud) while Marina is a very sweet yet kinda ditzy girl, her optimism never fails to make me smile although she did make me face-palm a few times. Their relationship feels natural and frankly adorable, but doesn’t forget that these are people with flaws that can get in the way of running smoothly. Our secondary leads, the trio of Mariah, Joe and Tess are also a lot of fun and very quirky. I must admit my favourite character overall is probably Mariah, which is weird because I’m not usually a fan of jerk characters but there was something really endearing about her so props to the writers for that. I also like how Highway Blossoms doesn’t explain everything but hints enough to get the imagination rolling, like the Trio’s backstory or even more about the miners journal itself. Heck after finishing the game I still think there’s something more to why Marina came out in the desert on her own but we get no more explanation than what she says, which is infuriating yet riveting at the same time.The artwork was gorgeous, each character design stood out and matched the personalities brilliantly. And the editing even got a bit hectic at times, it really added to the intense moments of the story, while the range of expressions were delightful to see (my particular favourite was Amber’s snarky face whenever she made a joke or took a jab at someone). Music is another strong point here and it’s one of those soundtracks I could easily listen to on its own, lots of guitars and that steady, easy driving atmosphere. It’s the kind of music I grew up listening to, mostly from my Dad, which actually means for me personally I could really connect to Amber’s loss of her Grandad and how much that music plays a part of her life, but even if you don’t have that connection I can still highly recommend this soundtrack.The writing, artwork and music were enough to make me enjoy the game, but let’s get onto the bit that really made me fall in love with it: the extras! You’ve probably noticed there’s 17 achievements, but you only get 10 of them for going through the story. The rest is all for glorious extras! Took me a while to get the very last one as it takes a bit of fiddling ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), but it didn’t feel like a boring hassle to do so. There’s the usual stuff, CG gallery, credits etc, and there’s also a gallery of guest art which is gorgeous, I’m definitely checking out these artists once I’ve posted this review. But then there’s the extra modes. You have goofball mode, which is worth going through the whole game again (on skip seen text) just to see these rather marvellous self-aware new dialogue, random text popups, and memes! Oh god this team has such a great sense of humour! The other mode is ‘EZ Mode’, which threw me off when I saw the option come up because this game is kinetic. There are no choices to make so why make it easier? But I played it and… if you compare an episode of ‘Yu Gi Oh!’ to an episode of ‘Yu Gi Oh! Abridged’ then you should get a good idea what EZ Mode is like compared to how the game is normally.Well that’s all I have to ramble about, overall this is a cute Yuri game with a fun story, enjoyable characters, and that extra special touch that just makes it a great experience. Highway Blossoms is one I can recommend to pretty much anyone who likes fun stories and good characters. Thank you so much AlienWorks for such a wonderful kinetic novel, I do look forward to seeing what else you come out with."

,Recommended,451760,30764175,Posted: 26 March,all,Palpz,"tl;dr Decent yuri kinetic novel, a story of grief, new love, forgiveness and healing; also, treasure hunting: 8/10.Overall, it's a good story. The characters are relatable and realistic, the scenario isn't overtly ridiculous, also it's at least a bit over the top. It does a very good job of making you actually care for Amber and Marina.I would highly recommend playing with the uncensor patch, since like any truely good VN (aka unlike most VNs), the sex scenes aren't there simply for fan service, but actually serve a as very important part of the character and plot development.It's relatively short; I finished it in probably about 5 hours of actual play time. It does have a 2nd mode, which allows for ""goofball"" scenes; I don't think I'll be playing it again just for those however. I felt it was a good length for the story it was telling. Unlike, for example, Grisaia no Kajitsu, I never felt that you were trying to slog through a bunch of dreck in order to get to the good stuff. Honestly, I find that far too many VNs seem to mistake length for quality, and end up padding the story with a bunch of stuff that just makes me despise it. This did not happen here.The art was good; you should be able to get a decent idea of what to expect based off just the screenshots available on Steam. The soundtrack helped set the mood nicely.I initially purchased this having missed the fact it is a kinetic novel rather than a full branching VN. Or Are KNs a subset of VNs? Anyways, in general I really do wish that the tags up top would emphasize that more, since the difference between choices and no choices is a pretty big deal IMHO. That having been said, it does make it pretty clear in the description, so that's my fault for missing it.Anyways, I'm rather pleased with the value I got for the purchase; bought during a valentine's day sale for 40% off.Also, if it matters at all, the cards this game drops sell for a weirdly high price; selling them ended up offsetting almost a quarter of the purchase price."

A cute, heartwarming story about overcoming the troubles of your past and finally taking a step forward to take your own happiness into account. The music is amazing, albeit the large pauses in between tracks - the art is absolutely adorable, and far higher quality than most visual novels on Steam - the story is bland at some points, though it's overall extremely interesting, and I was rarely bored - and, unlike most yuri visual novels that exist, the plot isn't based thoroughly on sex. Hell, you don't even get the scenes unless you patch the game, and it still seems like you aren't missing anything.

You know where this is going. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)The romance itself is flawlessly excecuted. It takes all the appropriate twists and turns and comes off as entirely authentic. I can't explain exactly why it's so good without spoiling everything, so I might was well end the review here.My only nitpicks are that there still seem to be some niggling proofreading issues that the devs haven't sorted yet, and that you could make a drinking game out of the number of times a character rolls thier eyes.I know it's effective at showing how the character is feeling, but seriously is there really no other way of expressing exasperation or passive-agressive contempt?Whatever, it's an emotional ride, so check it out."

Animated portions are simple but a nice touch.Neutral-Adult content adds little to nothing for plot (Do it for CG and achievement, I guess)-Pure visual novel. No choices to make, no side routes, no dead ends.-Around 7 hours reading time, depending on your reading speed.Cons-Needs a little bit of editing for grammar and spelling, though minor.-A named character left unused.Highway Blossoms offers a decent, queer narrative which follows two characters, Amber and Marina. They meet out of happenstance when Marina's car breaks down. Amber gives Marina a ride which evolves into a mad race for gold. The narrative is heartwarming but has its bumps along the way.Character tropes are present giving a sense of how some characters respond, however, character development breaks some of the general conventions. The adult portions do not add to plot and could also do with a bit of editing. One named character remained unused."

Wence [2RB],Highway Blossoms is an exception to the pandering Market many find on steam (Though there is nothing wrong with pandering to your audience at times)It isn't ground breaking new.. Its nothing you haven't seen before.. Mixing the Plots of the Road Journey and Coming of Age Romance... But perhaps that's why its enjoyable.The story is just as much made by the Two main characters; their trials tribulations and their triumphs as it is made by the background of 'Americana' and its fantastic OST; that fits right in with the themes and enhances them especially the 'Americana vibe' . And of course the story is not your usual school setting - Taking place in the American South West.For an OEL the series has Far above average art; very easy on the eyes. And the overall 'back ground art' well not perfect is certainly not lacking either.Highway Blossoms has an All Audiences and an 18+ - If you are 18 or over I certainly recommend adding the patch to obtain the full uncensored story. The Adult scenes in this story are not there for the sake of being there; they feel like they should be there; They fit with the story and its heroines and continue the good flow of the VN.I always enjoy a good Visual novel and some good Romance and this is both and im happy to recommend it.Also as a final note; there is added 'extra' content to allow for some small replay value to the VN once completed.

Even the main relationship feels pretty fresh for the most part, though there's some of the usual moments in it.  In general, it looks good, sounds great, and feels almost perfect, knowing when to be silly and when to be more grounded and serious.It's not perfect; the pacing feels off at times, ocassionally rushing through or dragging a bit, and there were a few bugs and missing features that they've thankfully been working hard to fix.  There's a few other tiny things here and there that I didn't like or didn't agree with, but nothing else really worth mentioning.(Having played it both with and without the developers' adult patch, I'd like to note that the scenes cut for this version include at least one that's a major part of the story; not having it doesn't break the plot, it's still easy enough to figure out what happened, but it does make things feel disjointed for a bit.

,Recommended,451760,24473389,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,Ace,"I stumbled upon this game on pure happenstance, and was initially very skeptical of it; since Western VNs have been very hit-or-miss in their writing, themes and quality.I'm happy to say my skepticism was completely unfounded, and that the writing here is some of the most well thought out, fleshed out, and mature I've seen in any VN, be it Western or Japanese.What sets this particular story apart from most Yuri VNs is the fact that it takes its Western influence and runs with it, taking American themes, landscape, geography, and culture into the story itself, and doing it in a way that doesn't detract at all from the very focused picture of the story regarding Amber and Marina (the main duo in the story) or the long, rather eventful drive across the american southwest.the overarching story doesn't at all get away from the very strong and very real themes the VN tries to represent. These themes include, but are not limited to: mourning, loss, coming of age, family, legacy, and of course, relationships.The most touching and important themes in the VN come from a lot of the inner-monologuing of the main character and narrator, Amber, as she deals with the loss of her grandfather, and a set of events she finds herself in, including meeting the other main in the story, Marina. The monologuing is never hamfisted, and tends to be very introspective, realistic, and will without doubt have you thinking of your current, or past relationships.Another great plus to note is the soundtrack, which punctuates the strong, emotional and even comedic themes very well, all while being true to the American theme and setting the story finds itself in.The weak points of the story lie in some of the 'wish fulfillment' aspects of how the story unfolds,with situations that are slightly too good to be true, but the pacing, and the more important personal relationships of the characters relegate this concern to a minor niggle.All in all, the VN is definitely a triumph for the Yuri genre, and for Western VNs and definitely worth picking up for anyone who enjoys a good, thoughtful interpersonal story, and who's probably sick of replaying Sono Hanabira for the 30th time."

It does not feature branching paths or story-bending choices; there is one route only, and you will not waver from its path. In this sense, it is more of a kinetic novel than a visual novel.That is not at all to say that the game doesn't deserve to be played. It's a cute tale of love in the strangest of places, of heartbreak, and of a deep sadness. I found myself experiencing many of Amber's emotions as she did; the art and the writing combined to create a beautiful tale. I was profoundly sad when it ended, not because the ending didn't satisfy me, but rather that I wantedmore. I felt an emptiness inside me because it was over and done with, and I'm really hoping AlienWorks writes a sequel. If not I may have to dust off the old fanfiction hat and give it a try myself.My only real complaint is that the game could do with proofreading; there are a few instances of sentences structured incorrectly, or words repeated where they shouldn't be.All in all, if you're looking for a fun tale and have a little money to spare, take a chance onHighway Blossoms.

Likewise, the treasure hunt mystery is fairly underplayed and mostly just serves as setup for a road trip story.That being said, it's a very well executed road trip story that gets across the unique mood and wonder of that particular genre while our heroines make their way through the American west. All characters are written very likeable and usualy manage to escape being stereotypes, despite being painted with a fairly broad brush.The romance itself is easily the best I've seen in a yuri visual novel so far. It develops with a slow, natural pace and feels awkward and fragile at times, like fledgeling relationships do. Aside from one little misstep of dipping into melodrama a bit too much, it is very genuine and heartfelt.As for the technical aspects, the artwork ranges from decent to pretty good, capturing landscapes with as much variety as it does the characters. They really made use of sprite moving and scaling in ren'py to make everything look more varried and dynamic than it usually does in low budget visual novels. The music too is mostly instrumental and sticks to the background, adding to the mood and atmosphere instead of getting annoying. I usually mute the music at some point in a VN, here I made it through 10 hours without feeling that impulse once."

And unlike most other VNs, it features a bevvy of contributions from other artists, adding stylistic but palatable changes to character appearances and backgrounds every now and then. The music is beautiful, the plot is easy to follow, and the inclusion of achievements makes absolutely no sense for such a straightforward game.In short, it's virtually the opposite of a Sakura game. It's the sort of game you would play for the story plot over the oppai plot.And for those of you who prefer the latter? Don't fret! The developer made downloading the adult patch free, easy to download and quick to install. It doesn't multiply the ecchi level to unreasonable levels, but you get two romantic sex scenes and a number of notable (and sometimes hilarious) changes in dialogue.In short, it compares to the Sakura franchise the same way inFAMOUS 2 compares to inFAMOUS.

During an otherwise uneventful drive through a desert in New Mexico, she comes across Marina whose car has just ran out of gas leaving her stranded. She picks her up and heads off to the nearest gas station. It is there that Amber learns about the second gold rush in the region. An old miner's journal has recently been discovered and published detailing instructions on where to find several hidden stashes of gold. Mostly by Marina's prodding, the duo head out on an adventure throughout the Southwest to find this treasure, though they are not the only ones looking for it.This game is a kinetic novel, a type of visual novel where there are no branching storylines and only one ending. It can be played as fast as the player can read it. I would estimate that it would take the average reader around 6-8 hours to read it from beginning to end.I thought the story was pretty good overall. It was enjoyable to read and humorous at times while also developing the relationship between the main characters at a good pace. Although the story was certainly enjoyable, I did feel it was more on the predictable side. There are no real plot twists and the ending is not exactly surprising. Still, as a feel-good story, it does the job well.The characters were a bright spot as well. The two main characters, Amber and Marina, come off as cute and likable and I enjoyed seeing their relationship unfold. They are somewhat clichéd, though, with Amber being the tomboy and Marina being the more girly girl.Two other aspects of this game deserve special mention. The first would be the art. The setting of the game, the Southwestern United States, is a bit unconventional for visual novels. I thoughtHighway Blossomsdid an excellent job of utilizing its setting. The background artwork was fantastic all around as it brought to life the desert environment. The sprites of the characters were well drawn, distinctive, and colorful. The only critique I have is that the CGs were a bit inconsistent with the rest of the artwork.The other outstanding aspect of this game would be the music. A lot of it really reminded me of music that you might hear in a western film befitting the game's setting well. I sometimes found myself pausing at moments during play just to listen to the music a little. It really enhanced the experience of reading this.Overall, despite a somewhat predictable plot, this is an enjoyable visual novel that includes great artwork, excellent music, and likable characters. If you like visual novels with a romance theme, you are likely to enjoy this."

The Americana themes and the setting were executed extremely well, and I felt fairly engrossed in it the whole way through. Halfway through, however, I kind of felt disillusioned with the characters, and kinda felt like they were just to plain and simple, but the game immediately shifted to telling their backstories and developing them, and it was wonderful. I'd recommend this VN to anyone who can appreciate a good romance, it's one of the least ""anime"" VNs I've ever playted as the Eastern influences are really not very present. Thanks Alienworks for making this short and sweet VN that really anyone can enjoy, I look forward to your future projects."

Yeah, I get it, it's part of her moving on, but it's too much if she keeps mentioning a dead person every other scene. Heh, I acutally agreed with Mariah on this one.Other technical problems are the inconsistent art and scaling. The head of the trucker dude is way smaller than Amber's round head and the girls' bust sizes doesn't match in many scenes. In one scene they have nicely-sized breasts, but they're a cup smaller in other scenes.I'll give it an 8/10 because I like the pacing and story.

But for some reason this one spoke to me. Maybe it was the art style, or the music, or perhaps the fact that it didn't feel the need to shove fanservice in my face in an attempt to get me to buy it. So, I parted with some money to check this story out.And what a story it is.The pacing of this story is perfect, and written so well. The characters are easy to fall in love with; Amber's wit and partial cyncism, Marina's optimism and at-times air-headedness. Even the near emotionless Tess is enjoyable in her own special way. As for the plot itself? It really knows how to absorb you into the tale. I had to know what happened next in the story, so by the time I finished it (in one sitting), it was well past 2 in the morning.The character art is exceptionally good, and I do enjoy how the characters actualy move around the screen when they're being described as moving. The background art is stunning as well, and I love that, with one or two exceptions, each location in the game has it's own specific background. The music is also a big part of the game and I did enjoy just taking a break from the story now and then to enjoy it. If I wasn't trying to save money at the monent, I'd definitely buy the soundtrack as well.Overall:While this might not look as flashy or interesting as some other VNs on steam, I promise you'll enjoy hopping onto this emtional and well told ride of a story.

,Not Recommended,451760,33526518,Posted: 13 July,all,Lady Fefa,"I really wish I could recommend this VN. As a lesbian woman, we don’t see much productions with queer characters, especially lesbians. Unfortunately, when someone does, it is unrealistic or overssexualized (or both). This review has spoilers.I didn’t really play many VN in my life but this one didn’t please me much. My advice is to buy only when is on sale and if you really want to play a yuri (girl likes girl) VN that the main characters aren’t sisters or that they don’t die at the end.First, the event that triggers the story is not convincing. The first hour watching is very boring and gave me the feeling that the story was going to be as plain as the presented premise of the adventure. The main character is a prickly pear that drives a RV (urgh) and the other one is a bubbly sweet, tending to stupidness, girl.The supporting characters are also plain and very annoying. One of them is overssexualized, dressed in a stupid way: I mean, who is going to use bikini under overalls and let the front part open revealing your body in the desert while driving a RV? I would force myself to buy that style if it was a more beach setting but… no. Pure fan service and nonsense.The only thing that made me play through the end was the fact that me and my girlfriend made a similar road trip towards that area (but we left from LA) and I felt nostalgic thinking about the places we’ve been. The setting was well written. Ah and of course the story is about a lesbian. The only part of the story that pleased me was after the first kiss until Las Vegas. The main character freaking out because she can’t discern her relationship with her grandpa and the one with her girlfriend was super weird and not convincing. I also have to say that the sex scenes were convincing and, writing wise, didn’t bother me. I was really expecting the worse.Visually, this VN comes short of the expected. I missed more different reactions and poses, especially for some moments. It would be great if they put more scenes like when they were at the firecamp. I got bothered many times due to the lack of emotion in the drawings. Sometimes I just focused on the text because the imagery wasn’t following the story. The sexualized women characters (Mariah especially) and the sex scene with childish women bodies… wrong.This is what happens when a guy writes a story about lesbian women.obs.: I have 10 hours because I left my computer on while doing other stuff... :rolleyes:"

I was also none to impressed with the plot jumps which seemed scattered throughout the story. One such instance is when the main character, Amber if I remember correctly, states that they both have secrets they do not want to tell each other and in the next instance both know each other secrets, but the viewer is left none the wiser. The BGM is also quite good, but it tends to cut out quite a lot which disrupts the story's ambiance.

At first I kind of found myself wishing that this was Life is Strange part 2 where Max and Chloe stole Frank's van and took off to the American West.But, the more I read the story the more Amber and Marina grew in their own right. I simply adore the characters. They show true growth and I enjoyed Amber's soul searching at the end, and the ending was perfect. I will say that in order to have character growth, you have to tolerate that Amber is a little bossy and immature at first. But, that makes what happens later all the more enjoyable.This delivers on everything it promises, it may not involve choices but you have a wonderful journey through a very interesting setting with characters you grow to love. Well worth the money. If you want you can easily get more ""adult"" content.  But I really enjoyed the story as it was. I wish Steam would take down all the silly age restriction stuff.Much better than being told your choices will matter when they won't, growing to really like chracters to only see them (and you) get scr**ed over at the end, watching writers struggle with stupid time travel tropes only to fall in line with them at the end, and no cheap mental break mazes where dialog is looped in and reused from prior scenes. Oh, and the only bottles have cheap beer in them and they get drunk and tossed around. No stupid made up tasks to round them up so you can shoot them.But, don't buy this VN for what it isn't, buy it for what it is!

The lead characters, Amber and Marina, are both likeable, their interactions together often cute, and many of their quips genuinely amusing. Having the story set not only in the United States but not in a high school was a breath of fresh air. Although I can’t say I’ve played a huge number of visual novels the premise of road trips is interesting and unlike anything I’ve seen since Katahane.That being said, the story is at its strongest when it is not being a discount National Treasure. The treasure hunt plot felt unnecessary in the long run, and the story could have easily been a sightseeing tour on the way to California, finding the beauty in nature and growing closer without the motivation of money (still, I can see the treasure hunt being a metaphor and the actual treasure not being anything gold). There is also some drama in the tail-end of the story that is resolved far too quickly and cleanly.Despite these faults I can still recommend this to anyone looking for a yuri-themed visual novel. The music was above average compared to anything else I’ve heard in the genre, and despite there being no voice acting the characters are highly expressive even thorugh static sprites, which often move around the screen to give the impression of animation. The artwork for the sprites is quite good, but the CG art is inconstant, some of them giving Amber noticeably shorter hair than she has.Pros:+Great characters+Good music+Unconventional settingCons:-Story feels unfocused at times-Inconsistent art"

It was on sale, and the reviews were pretty good, so I bought it. Not without some qualms: it was made by a studio I'd never heard about, and the setting seemed difficult to nail down in a kinetic novel like this one. I wasn't sure if I'd regret my decision or not.Thankfully, Highway Blossoms is one of the most charming and entertaining visual/kinetic novel I've read in a long time. I don't regret buying it in the slightest.I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis--lots of other people have done that already. Anyway, a synopsis wouldn't do the characters, scenarios, and events in this novel justice. It's brief, only officially 4-6 hours (I finished in three because I couldn't put it down), and it's clichéd and hamfisted in a few points, but these flaws don't distract from something with this much heart, tact, and beauty. Some of the art is impeccable, the soundtrack is brilliant at points (especially the credits song), and the characters never failed to make me laugh or gasp when that was their intent. I've always been a sucker for love stories--I guess it shows--but this is one story I'll be a sucker for for a long time coming. It makes me want to go out on an adventure of my own some day.TL;DR: Give this game a try. Even if you don't LOVE it, you might get something out of it. I know I did."

If you are into interesting background depictions (American Mid-West, treasure hunt around real geographic locations, desert music festival, on the road scenarios...), this is a BUY!2. If you are into visual novels (beware: no game or interaction!) with good graphics (persons and backgrounds) and lots of different (and also good) music, this is a GOOD BUY!3. If you are into stories with a bit of action telling behind it - where a treasure search against time and some adversaries  (also good depicted and with good story elements) actually leads to a gold finding...and a far grater love treasure in the course of action ;-) - this is a RECOMMENDED BUY!4. If you are into romantic story telling of two young adults with some dramatic elements in it due to personal problems regarding familiy loss and commitment fears - this is a VERY RECOMMENDED BUY!5. If you are into yuri / girl x girl stories where you can actually believe (due to good character and personality and action depictions) that both girls fell in love in the course of the story, this is an ABSOLUTE MUST BUY!...because, simply put, there are many stories out there which are not believable at all (and even wishful thinking doesn't help).6. There is some optional 18+ mature content as well (not within Steam, please read other postings below on how to activate it) which actually is no plot device but fits just fine into the story.IMO the graphics are not so interesting (though they are worth watching ;-)) as is the story-telling during those scenes, again it depicts rather well the character and background story of both girls. For 18+, you CAN BUY!Perhaps I should write a far longer review because I like Highway Blossoms very much, I truly recommend this novel.IMO Very good work, Alienworks!By the way: The girls' names are Amber and Marina... :-)"

Even the adult scenes are in a good taste, if you download the 18+ patch, which I highly recommend for full story experience, if you are old enough of course. The art is very well done, even though in 2 or 3 scenes the faces look different than in the rest of the ""game"".  Over all, I'd give it a strong 9/10 because of some minor annoyances, and putting default character models in scenes which could use some more variety. Must buy for everyone with a taste for good romance, comedy and yuri."

Besides that I usually am not a big fan of visual novels, including the fact that this game is more of a kinetic novel, because you don't make choices yourself, you just sit back and take in the story. I wasn't sure first, but while I was putting all the games into my cart in summer sale I was like ""why the hell not"" (it was -15% too). Surprisingly this is the first game I played after the summer sale and i totally didn't regret it, even though it was a wise idea to play it at night with everybody asleep if you know what I mean!First of all it's logical that this game kinda speaks to me with the homosexual protagonist, so there was a reason I should at least enjoy this game a bit (which I totally did!).I am not experienced with visual novels, but i think the game and gameplay is kept quite simple, which doesn't bother if you've got nothing against some reading and sinking into the story.I DID sink into the story a lot, it's really nice and cute and so funny, i can't tell how many times I had to pull myself together not bursting into laughter afraid of waking up my parents! I got really attached to the characters, which made me kinda sad to see it end. The game took be about 8 hours to finish it. I also love the soundtrack, it gives everything the right mood! I especially love the acoustic guitar tracks, made me feel 'dem feels. And also the artwork is super lovely, kept taking screenshots even though you get a gallery after finishing it.To sum it up in a very subjective way, the game is so lovely and funny it is really worth playing it when you are into yuri!

It's my first Visual Novel, and I will let you know in a short review how i think about it.StoryI love the story so much because its something different since it takes place in the Southwest.Amber, a ninteen years old girl, is driving with her motorhome to a music festival. She meets Marina, a cute eighteen years old girl but the problem is, Marina's car is stolen. Marina lets Amber know about a treassure so Amber decides to give Marina a ride to search for it.CharactersI like the Characters very much. Every Character was different and i nearly liked every one of them becuase they are very lovely designed.Visual/AudioThe Visual Novel is very nice animated/drawn. If you compare it to other Visual Novels on Steam, you will realise that its nearly one of the best on Steam. You can play it for sure in Fullscreen without losing quality (HD). Oh gawd i liked the audio in the background so much.. you just had so much feels only because of the music. Just nearly cried at some moments. The song in the end was very lovely so please dont skip the credits.To sum upI would surely rate this Visual Novel 9/10 if not even 10/10. I will read it a second time, because you get more options to read since you finished it once. Its just sad to know that its over, because you just have so much feelings during reading. If you are not sure to buy it JUST BUY IT and give it a try. And dont forget to install the adult patch, for the sex scenes.(Im sorry for my bad english :P)"

I could go down the line with what I like and don't like, but many others have done that.  I just feel that this is truly worth the buy, as it really got me in the heart.  The music was used perfectly to augment the scenes, the characters each felt interesting enough that they could carry the story (primarily the MC and her Rival character), and the fact that this story is just full of heart.This is good for fans and newbies to both VNs and KNs, and I could not more heartily recommend it."

I don't think so, but it's hard to compare anything to that as far as I'm concerned. It certainly is much better than I was expecting, though, and I didn't buy it thinking it was going to be bad. My only complaints are 1: the scenes when they're driving, because the persective of the back of the RV is totally off, and something bothered me about how long their necks were drawn, and 2: occasionally the sprites would get stuck on each other and stack up when moving around."

The characters are very well written and everyone feels unique. I started reading around midnight and by the time I looked at the clock it was 6am and I had to get ready for work. It's a very engrosing tale that is a must read.

Part of the climax revoles around something that's been mentioned but never clearly defined or established. The whole ""treasure hunt"" aspect of the VN is easily the weakest and by the end the gold isn't even particuarly narratively important to the story anymore.But the quality aspects of HB manage to shine through despite its flaws. It's still a charming story that manages to not overstay its welcome in the least, and definitely worth a look."

,Recommended,451760,34912153,Posted: 12 September,all,Winged,"This game was absolutely wonderful. I bought it on a sale since I was bored and looking for cute stories to read through someday. It languished in my library for months before I booted it up a few days ago.16 hours later, I've had such an enchanting time. The game's wonderful soundtrack, thoughtfully developed characters, and themes of sincere friendship and recovery really stuck to me. Kinda expected a ""yuri VN"" and what I got wasn't that yuri or that VN? As far as it relates to the Japanese ones I'm used to anyway. It's an American story made by American developers about two American girls set in an Americana-heavy roadtrip adventure.Also, speaking as a queer girl, this definitely felt like a story about queer girls written for other queer girls? Even the sex scenes (assuming you download the expanded content patch, which I greatly recommend) are less about titillation and more about developing their character dynamic and reifying the themes everpresent in the story. They don't feel pornographic at all.10/10Came for the cute lesbians, stayed for the heartfelt story of love and loss and love again. Probably the most poignant thing in my entire Steam collection."

Also has a 18+ version.Grab it on sale, the price is steep for the time you get playing.7/10"

It really struck a nerve, in a good way, having lost my own father a few years ago.It's not perfect, there are some words missing here and there, like -are- and -here- but that's a minor gripe.Also, as a aside to the developers, the art piece with Amber and Mariah drunkenly shouting at each other in Mariah's RV is by far my favorite piece. Well done!"

76561198089456464,Recommended,451760,34164488,Posted: 11 August,all,Tygriss,"Okay, I thought having finished the game and really enjoying it I should write a review.The game is a visual novel, not really any interaction through the whole of it but that is not a bad thing at all since it would detract from the powerful story.Now I'm not going to give away any spoilers but it takes you on an inspiring journey through Amber who is on a road trip with a purpose. On her way she has a run in with a strange, child like girl on the road in need of help and together they journey on a road of discovery meeting some strange and engaging characters along the way.The story is powerful and moving but can take some getting into. But once you are drawn in you will want to see what happens next. It does have a yuri/lesbian theme and yes there is a 18+mod but that is missing the point. If you go in for just the yuri you are missing out the point of emotions and development between two people.All in all probably one of the best visual novels I've come across and would like to see it made into a proper animation."

,Recommended,451760,34296073,Posted: 16 August,all,Kuroisuzume,"Wow.Highway Blossoms was my first VN of any kind, and I have to say I didn't know how I'd take to playing a game without gameplay. I was absolutely blown away. I had to take crack to get my mind off of it. The characters, pacing, art and music are all excellent. At first I found some characters to be annoying, but by the end I loved them. At first the music only seemed capable, but then I often found myself ignoring the scenes entirely and just taking in the music. In one instance, the song looped so many times it stopped playing before I had finished the scene. I plan on buying the soundtrack, if only to support these wonderful, wonderful developers.I want to leave a note about the adult patch, as I did play with it installed. It was one of my favorite parts of Highway Blossoms, but not because it's smut. It doesn't add a lot of content, but what is there is so well-writen and soft-spoken that it felt like it deserved to be there as a part of their story rather than as a bonus to get you off. It, like the rest of this visual novel, is a very human depiction of love and passion with actual nuance, so much so that I was awkwardly crying during one of the sex scenes. It's my favorite adult patch in anything to date. Anyway.You don't have to play with the patch, it's great. I hope that I can add a bit to the adoration for this visual novel so that others will experience it too, and get these guys on the path to making something new! Highway Blossoms was worth every cent, and I can't wait to see what they come out with next."
76561198041595633,Recommended,451760,35095322,Posted: 20 September,all,Earlzy,"Hmm, what to say about this title that hasn't already been said? What words could even do justice to how I feel?Let's make one thing clear: reading Highway Blossoms was an unforgettable experience.I can't recall any recent media work I've consumed that has made me as obsessed with it as HB has. My thoughts are overtaken by this story. Replaying scenes in my mind and sighing wistfully at how well done they were. Imagining myself hanging out with Marina and Amber, because they are legitimately loveable characters that I would absolutely want to hang out with in real life (Amber reminds me so much of me, it's amazing). Being inspired enough to cement my plans to get an RV and roam around the highways endlessly.This was a powerful story, I'm telling you.I guess I can give this a proper review treatment, too, if my babbling about how deeply this VN touched me didn't convince you to buy it. Seriously, please buy it. When they release the fully-voiced version you'll get it for free, whereas if you wait until after the voiced version releases, it'll be more expensive. I mean, it'd be worth it either way, but it's up to you. But you really should buy this.Visuals: 8/10Not really anything to complain about here. Any limitations in how the visuals are done is likely an artifact of how the engine itself works (they use Ren'Py, I believe). The portraits are cute and well done; the characters have enough different expressions and poses that it doesn't feel like they're just copypasted talking heads. The backgrounds are gorgeous, if simple in detail. The text boxes are done nicely, and you can adjust the opacity and stuff if you want to make it more readable for you.Sound: 9/10The music in this is excellent. I definitely sprang for the soundtrack so I could listen to it anytime. It always suits the mood really well, besides being great music on its own (Far Between is becoming one of my favourite songs ever). I'm actually listening to the soundtrack as I type this. Once the fully-voiced version releases I'll probably update this to 10/10 (the voices in the trailer are so close to what I imagined for the characters anyway).Story/writing: 10/10The writing in Highway Blossoms is so, so good. The story is wonderful itself, but what really shines is how well-developed the main characters become throughout the story. Both Amber and Marina are so likeable and so relatable; I found I was really able to get into both of their heads, so while I didn't always agree with them, I could understand why they did and said the things they did. And frankly, I'd much rather disagree with my otherwise-relatable protagonist and yell at her NO AMBER WHY DID YOU DO THAT HOW COULD YOU OMG than to not understand her decision at all. Even the trio, Mariah included (annoying though she may be), are really loveable characters. The pacing is great, the dramatic tension is built up and released very satisfyingly, and yeah, I definitely cried a couple times. Also, once you finish your first run through, I encourage you to immediately turn on the goofball mode and play it again; the extra dialogue (and extra visuals, I was surprised to note) are absolutely hilarious.To summarize: BUY HIGHWAY BLOSSOMS. You owe it to yourself to read this. If you like a cute fluffy yuri story with a lot of sweetness and just enough angst, you can't go wrong with this one."
