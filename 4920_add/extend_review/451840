,Not Recommended,451840,31295556,Posted: 22 April,all,ZeroS4™,"trust me, its a fun game. but after the lead developer dean hall abandoned yet another game(this one) the dev team decided not to continue but to create a new game instead. wich in my eyes is nasty as hell since out of ammo isnt done, so if u want to buy it for its content right now wait for a sale, IMO not worth 15 bucks."
,Not Recommended,451840,28546372,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,[WK] Keragon,"I've said this before in other reviews and I'll say it again: This game joins the sea of poorly designed, overpriced games at a really bad time.The concept is great, and like most of the other designers out there that make not so great games, they make it look amazing in the videos on their store page. The game itself is fun for about an hour or so, but then you run out of content and you start to notice the bad ballance bugs. It's also quite frustrating because you just defend until you lose, there is no real way to win in the base modes.The first person shooter parts of the game feel fun, and the missions revolving around that are fun (minus the sniper mission). It just feels like they need to expand on that and allow more freedom to attack the enemy in the game in base mode.It's expensive and you get a couple of hours of game time for that price tag... Just keep that in mind when you buy."
,Recommended,451840,22537997,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,MegaBert,"Watching gameplay of this title before my Vive came in, I was somewhat unimpressed by the simplistic graphics, and I thought it didn't look like all that compelling of a game.Holy crap I was wrong.Out of Ammo is incredibly intuitutive, challenging, fast-paced, and certainly a great showcase of what room-scale VR can really do, and I am incredibly excited to see what the dev team plans on adding in the future. One thing that certainly doesn't come across in videos is how the game places you in the world. In videos, it looks like the ground (when controlling units from above) is roughly at knee level, but in-game, the ground is actually closer to waist level, and I wish I could explain how immersive this makes controlling your units.Another amazing utilization of VR controls that the game utilizes is in the reloading and grenade-throwing; incredibly intuitive, accurate, and satisfying every time you do it. Also a lot of room for personal mastery of the mechanics; after practicing the sniper rifle a lot, I have a good feel for where it's pointing without aiming down the scope, and the potential for efficient, practiced cocking of the rifle makes it feel very powerful in your hands.The one gameplay aspect I would love to see added is soldier progression, and the devs themselves have expressed plans for adding this in the close future (soldier levelling based on enemies killed, or something along those lines). Another feature I am excited for (which again, the devs have plans for adding in the more distant future) is co-op play. It's my understanding that the prototypes for this multiplayer component are in very very early alpha stages, so I'm unsure if it would involve online, local, or both sorts of multiplayer gamelay, but either way, I am excited and intrigued by the possibility.Besides all the actual gameplay aspects that I enjoy, the communication from the dev team has been absolutely fantastic. Not only have they rolled out at least one major update per week for the past 6 weeks (as long as I've owned the game), but every time, they include the full patch notes, current recognized bugs or issues, and goals for the next patch or hotfix (which usually is posted < 24 hrs after a major patch, and typically resolves most of the recognized bugs). I don't often see this level of communication from devs to players in non-VR games, not to mention the brand new VR game space, and it is extremely refreshing to see a team that not only details it's goals to players via patch notes, but also goes out of their way to respond to player's concerns directly on the Steam discussion forums. Couldn't be more impressed with how the team responds and deals with player feedback.For 15$, if you own a Vive, this is a must-buy in my opinion.EDIT:Deleted several immature replies regarding Dean Hall's influence in this game, after his experience with DayZ. The fact of the matter is that this game, for me, is already worth 15$. If you don't think an Early Access game is worth it at the time of you buying it, you should probably wait until it has what you're looking for. This game has received significant patches every week since I bought it, and has only further validated my 15$ purchase. Seriously, for 15$, this game is a freaking steal. It's my second most-played VR game behind Audioshield, which I bought for 25$ (and hasn't received a patch in over a month, unlike this game)."
,Not Recommended,451840,28840328,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,wantwon,"This game makes little use of room-scale and has little movement involved, despite large, open maps being used. On top of this, the weapons are underwhelming and unreliable. Finally, there is a scarce amount of content. The devs are working on a different version of this game to be sold separately instead of integrating it as dlc, which means this game is all but abandoned. Nothing exciting or beyond passable once you start playing."

76561197993470909,Not Recommended,451840,25586728,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,FakeCrusader,"Like some other reviewers, I want to recommend this game but after playing it for a while I don't think it is good value, especially as it is a release now. (not sure why Steam thinks I only played this for 1.8 hrs so far, done a lot more time than shown!)Strategy (?): this isnota strategy game as such, you can't even play it very tactically.This is essentially half the game it should be because it doesn’t support offensive play. It’s actually a tower defence game. I would not have bought it as a TD game as it’s not a good example of one.You have no control over which resources you get, you have no control over the resource ""flow"", i.e. nothing you do can speed up delivery. There's not really a lot for you to do other than possess units or use commander abilities once you get enough points.After several games you’ll soon start to recognise the point where you think “Well this is where my base gets destroyed and there’s nothing I can or could have done about it”.I would also like to be able to move out of a single base location, that would start to enable more strategic thinking.Reward & progressionStrategy games normally have a win condition, but OOA just keeps throwing harder waves at you. That's an arcade gaming style and I think it's lazy to implement it in a game of this type. There aren't any powerups or upgrades, just some achievements. I won’t be playing it long term unless I can win and progress, e.g. at least put the maps into a campaign arc accessible after level completion.It would be better if you were in contention for something, like the control point system in Company of Heroes.Possession: this is the best feature of this game but it has some problems.Due to the poor AI, you won’t want to stay in possession for more than 30 seconds as you can be pretty sure that the rest of your AI soldiers are letting things go down the crapper. I’d like to be comfortable in knowing they can cope without babysitting.Cooldown - really not needed, drop this limitation.You are stuck in the location where the soldier is based. You move around a bit by walking in the play area but there is no teleport or other means of relocating. Frustrating when you have enemy around the corner of a building.Options: this game needs more gameplay options.Gun angle: pistol hold angle is way off, if it was a real gun you'd be shooting yourself in the foot. Let the player choose hold angle.Reloads: allow us to turn off manual reloads or make manual reloads obligatory in a ""hard"" game mode. It's fun to do at the start as an immersion factor but they don't work very well and can be really frustrating (especially on the MG nest!).Board height - the option is there but seems to be reversed - pushing the up arrow makes the player higher, not the ground level. You also need to keep going in and out of game to set it. See Final Approach on how to do it well…AI: Not great, your soldiers have no survival instincts and happily run at the enemy or don't fire back. The claim that you can give your soldiers ""orders"" is false, you can give them one order - ""go there"". No fighting stance, patrol, guard, etc. Orders are not placed on individual soldiers either, you get to asked for a unit type to move to location - which may not be the one you’d like to do it.Balance:It’s not a balanced game in that it runs harder waves at you but doesn’t compensate you.The enemy gets more units, you don’t.The enemy gets tanks, you don’t. You get one anti tank soldier if you are lucky, and you can’t order soldiers to protect him. You don’t get any anti-tank emplacements or traps. Artillery strikes slow tanks but it takes two to kill one.My HQ is getting pounded by a huge shell coming from somewhere! WTF is that all about?Performance: runs well but I had an occasion where it started to slow down after a long game - maybe memory leakage issues?Bugs / bad design:Level graphics are OK, but the Minecraft soldiers are lame (but probably nicely low poly count). It’s not always that easy to figure out who is who.On one level all the attackers run and hide behind a rock in a corner, if you don't realise they are there and kill them, the level appears to doing nothing.I can see clear across the map, but when I possess a sniper, the distance is fogged, making long shots on enemy snipers impossible. WTF?As someone who uses a telescopic rifle, I can see that the sniper rifle aiming mode is (maybe) trying to be realistic, but I think it’s a little too realistic making it really hard to get shots lined up (you can’t rest a Vive controller to stabilise it like a rifle, it’s not even got pistol stability due to it’s weight!). Make this more user friendly, save the sniper super accurate simulation for a sniper sim game.There is a night sight option but it I didn’t find it very useful or easy to use, mainly due to the above issues.Too easy to call in an artillery or strafing strike on the wrong map location, it needs a better confirmation system. Also seems to be no way of cancelling artillery, etc. once you pick it but decide not to fire it.Strafing is too slow since this needs the plane animation to run and often arrives when the area is clear. A better option may be to have a gunship or UAV constantly over base that can replace the strafing fire feature, as these won’t need to be “storied in”.Icarus mission: really confusing, seemed to be in slow mo and could not load gun. Assume WIP as this is pretty awful right now.Nice to haves:Minefield drop as a commander power.Deployable and driveable tanks, maybe as a command power, although vehicles per se would be a nice future branch.Unit upgrades, e.g. sniper with 6 shot rifle at level 2. Ability to change sight types.In summary to make this a better rounded and enduring game I would like to see:Proper strategy elements.Better resource model.Better unit control and AI.Slicker sniper aiming.Reliable manual reloads or an option to automate them.Improve what is there already before adding more features please!"

This team hasn't just dropped the game on us and disappeared, they've been working their @sses off to refine it and add content.This is a very good example of early access done right._________________________________________________________If you own an HTC Vive, this is a great title to own. It's a lot of fun with its core mechanics in place, aiming, shooting, placing defencesI would say, the only thing it lacks right now is some form of progression. You can jump into different locations and start telling troops where to station themselves, where to setup defences, and then you can jump into any one of them and start shooting baddies.If there were progression, new weapons to buy, new troop types to buy, money to be gained, of course. New defenses, upgrades, etc, that would be awesome.I've always enjoyed games that allow you to eventially become superpowered, and this would be the perfect kind of experience.All the same, as it is, it's a great VR experience, I found myself ducking out of fire, and handling bad guys like a pro. Hopefully the devs keep up the amazing work and add more content to this already very polished experience."

Multiplayer can still be very, very buggy, is prone to trolling without a kick function.This game was in early access for a while, however, bugs that are long known are still not fixed. Also, now they are planning to move on and do not continue development on this game anymore, even though one could say that it still feels like an early access game: buggy and unfinished.I had high hopes for this game and waited for the post-release patches to evaluate this game, and unfortunately I am disappointed :("

,Recommended,451840,23199524,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,axelhunter,"[Update]Now that the game is properly released, I wanted to bring up a few problems I've seen in the full release. The biggest issue I've run into is that the ground is a good half-foot below you. This means that if you drop anything, you probably can't pick it back up, which essentially guarantees failure in some missions. In particular, the mission where your plane has crashed in the night and you have to hold your point until evac arrives is amazing, but the crux of the mission involves picking up scattered ammo, which I can't pick up unless it's on an incline. And if I drop the radio or flashlight, I'm boned. There's a setting to change floor height, which I've fiddled with to each extreme and everywhere in between, and never made a positive impact, if any at all.The missions are incredible, but seem virtually impossible without a co-op buddy. At this point, that's a lot to ask. But overall, I still completely recommend this game, just with a few more caveats.(Original Review Below)When Reloading Feels Cool!Few games today give you a bolt action rifle for good reason. It's slow and keeps you out of the action. But as the enemy bares down on you, knowing your comrades are depending on you, you feel your moves a little smoother, a little faster. You pull a fresh round from your hip pouch and place it in the chamber. You slam the lever forward. Now you reacquire your target in the scope. You fire. You win.Damn this game is awesome. The game started chugging past wave 50 when the action would really get nuts, but overall it functions very well for being early access. I hope there becomes more ways for the game to escalate as you get to the really high waves, but overall, this is an excellent mix of FPS and RTS that I hope fleshes out really well.This game is already worth it right now, and I can't wait to see what the future holds!"

I liked the Immersion and the UX and it all felt like a wonderful VR demo.As a game it lacks in depth, long term motivation as you merely try to survive X waves longer than in your last attempt.I would have accepted it as what it is, a rather shallow nice minigame weren't it for the♥♥♥♥♥♥move of deciding to not add any new content as promised, but to release that in a new game.Then again, fool me once (an unfinished, lacking DayZ) shame on me... fool me twice (an unfinished, lacking Out of ammo) shame on me.Get it in a sale maybe or when some other dev picked up the idea and made a really kickass RTS/FPS VR hybrid. :P"

I got it because it's one of the only RTS-like MP games for Vive right now, but the MP aspect of Out of Ammo is frustrating. Connecting with friends in-game is variably successful. Sometimes I can find them on the friends list; when I can't I have to quit the game and restart to update the friends list. Also, there are no volume controls in a match and the music always turns itself on when we join MP. It's super loud, making it impossible to communicate with your teammate.This game may be more enjoyable in single player. In multiplayer it more frustrating than fun."

If you get the balancing right, this will turn in amazing game. Right now, the HQ is a too overpowered as when I was about 30 minutes in (wave 100ish), the artillery was still able to clean up the entire wave. Another thing I noticed (but this might be harder to balance for) is that placement of items heavily relied on the amount of space I could walk around in. It might be useful to have some sort of teleportation feature so I can roam the map and expand where I place turrets (along the lines of Age of Empires where I want to grow my base).Overall, great work and cannot wait for more!"
,Recommended,451840,23028825,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,Null,"Out of Ammo is a wonderfully underrated VR game and hidden gem. It scratches my RTS itch while at the same time letting me join the fray by taking control of individual units to help out.The maps are varied, and they just added a few new alpha maps. I love the d-day map because it is a little more titled in the player’s favor (but it still ends up in tragedy once you get up to wave 45+). The other maps are harder to properly defend (until you start to get the hang of it- even still, it’s a little tough) because you have to defend all around you (as where the new d-day map you primarily have to worry about the hill enemies all funnel into (Snipers do spawn on the mountains behind you and an occasional enemy zerg will come from the sides or behind you- but very rarely).My favorite part of the game is the active reloading per unit. Every time you reload it’s like a fun mini-game. With a solider you have an m16 and have to take out your empty clip, reach down, and slam a new one in. Snipers have bolt action rifles which require you to fire your shot, pull back the lever, reach down to get a new bullet, place it in the gun, then push the lever in. Rocket guys have RPG’s- similar mechanics to the M16 except after you fire you reach down for a new rocket, medics have pistols and engines have pump action shotguns. But the most fun, in my opinion, is when you are in the heavy machine gun nest and you are firing that bad boy. You can watch the belt of ammo run out- and once it does, you have to push these handles back, lift up the top of the machine gun, reach down to the ammo box and grab another belt of ammo, slap it into the machine gun, close the lid, then pull the levers towards you, then you can engage the enemy.Sometimes, with any of these reloading “mini-games” they tend to bug out. When you reach down sometimes to reload the M16 or sniper, you won’t bring back up ammo, so you have to do it a few times (although I’ve been getting the hang of it and it seems like after the latest update it’s not as big of a deal).My biggest grip with the game is I wish they would let you have more units and structures. The enemy forces can get insane in the later waves and they will zerg which will eventually overpower your forces because after awhile, if you max all units and structures- the helicopter that resupplies you between waves still comes- but will just land and leave, leaving nothing behind.But there aren’t really that big of a deal- the rest of the game really shines over the imperfections- and with the game in such an early state, I am confident it will only get better- considering the game as it stands is the most fun I have had in VR."

More guns were added, but none to the strategy levels. Instead, development effort that should've been spent in improving the strategy gameplay, adding more options there, more functionality, improved AI or higher fidelity enemy units (more motion, posing, etc) but no.They made three missions that are from a soldier's point of view, which is the weaker part of the game. There's no 2-hand use of weaponry, rifles are held in one hand and reloaded with the other. There's no locomotion in the strategic view, or when possessing in the defense missions, there's no ability to request certain types of troop or structure, multiplayer defaults to hosting a public server, and there are also many more issues that I don't care to list.The team who made this are good at making games.

As a wave of enimies were pushing forward I possesed the rifleman and looked to the left just in time to hear a bang and watch a mans head get blown clean off and roll down the hill. The game may have blocky graphics but watching that was pretty intense. War is hell.

Even though it's in early-access it's still rather challenging, it runs perfectly and has a decent variety of maps. It can be quite difficult to manage all of your troops, as well as build new defenses and defend the base from all angles - but i'm sure it will become more fluid as time goes on. If you have the HTC Vive I would whole-heartedly urge you to give it a go, and if you're not enjoying it, you can always refund it!"

It's like they took the best parts of Final Approach but in a genre that I like a lot more (tower defense/strategy).  Hopefully they keep updating the game, fixing bugs and balance etc.  What would REALLY make the game a killer app is if there were about 200-300 waves and they scaled a lot better, so that each wave was definitely slightly harder than the one before it so that basically no one ever reached the highest level.  Then you could have a global and local scoreboard and compete with both your friends locally and everyone else globally.  Make it so that if you are decent you can get to level 30-50, good 100, great 150 and 200 is perfect."
,Recommended,451840,22726491,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,Lazer32,"Simple base defense game with lots of fun mechanics!  Set up your bases defenses (Guard towers, sandbag emplacements, bunkers, and machine gun nests).  Currently you can only get a small number of defenses at once but hopefully they can scale it out a bit and add some more variety down the road.  One of the coolest things about this game is you can take direct control of your soldiers.  Each soldier has a different type of weapon and with each weapon comes different firing modes and reload mechanics.  Yes, you have to physically reload your weapons which I think will become a must have for any VR first person shooter moving forward.  With the rifle you have to take out the mag and slap a new one back in.  There is a pump action shotgun on one of the engineers that is tons of fun.  Keep that left trigger button held in to grip the pump action and fire / pump away to your hearts content.  Overall, I'm having a blast with this game.  I cannot wait until they add more content.  I'm really hoping they expand the maps a bit to allow for more base structures and I'm really hoping they eventually add vehicles.  Anyway, I better sum this up before I start turning this review into a wishlist!Pros:*Great VR implementation of a base defense game.  Try to survive as long as you can against the terrorist hordes!*Weapon mechanics are great, have to physically reload them which ends up making a whole lot of sense in VR and is actually quite fun to do.  Really makes you feel like you are handling a real weapon!Cons:*No coop :(*Limited variety ATM but lots of potential to expand*While there are multiple maps many of them feel like they play about the same.  Base layouts don't change much between them"

Use what is provided to defend your base for as long as possible.  The trick here is you are a god overlooking little soliders....until you select one and take his perspective and Rambo the s*&% out of a wave of baddies.  There's a little more to it but that is the basic idea.The trick is managing your assets, while also jumping in to fight as one of them to defend HQ which becomes a game of cat and mouse until your ultimate demise.  The longer  you last, the more points you get.  It's you against the world as there is just one global score board with scores for each map at this point in development.I love the nades and reloading mechanic.  It's still a little buggy at times but ripping that clip out, reaching back for another, slamming it in, and tearing through the baddies is so much fun.  By the time I am done with a round, my heart is racing, I'm sweating profusely, and I have massive rug burns from dropping behind cover.

Trust me when I say that, even with the amount of content in the game right now, this price is a steal.  Many of the games on the Vive cost just as much or more and will entertain you for much less time.  There are really big plans for this game, so it will only continue to grow until it is one of the biggest hits on the Vive.  If you own a Vive and the price is still $15, get this game now, since they will raise the price as more content is released (which is totally fair).

What I'd prefer in this kinda game would be at least the option for another mode, where you still face endless waves of mobs, but the difficulty is wayyyyy reduced and you're scored on difficulty x ""time you can stay alive"" at that difficulty.  Something like that.  I would have fun playing this game for hours if you could actually play this game for hours without constantly knowing that certain, unbeatable death, was coming in right about at 15m.

You play the game by building bunkers around your base and assigning units to them to defend, using your long cooldown super strikes, or posessing individual units and shooting at the enemies yourself (with manual reload).There are a variety of maps for the defend mode, although they typically offer the same type of gameplay.

If you're going to be a salty salty saltbag about that fact, then please downvote this review for bonus salt. However, if you're open to good games offering quality fun-times, regardless of where they're coming from, then this is the review for you!In short, the game is awesome. Even if there was no further development on it and it stayed like this permanently, I'd still recommend you buy it. It's just that fun.The combination of RTS and shooter is well executed, and the transition between the two modes is easy and smooth. Placing the defences and assigning units is intuitive. The wave structure of enemies is good, sometimes being delivered by trucks, or descending from the hills or from city side streets.When possessing units, each weapon type has its own mechanics, such as bolt-action snipers, mounted machine guns requiring both hands, etc.The difficulty is pretty good - it starts out just easy enough to let a beginner find their feet, and ramping up gradually to a full-blown clusterf&$%. You have to defend your HQ building, and when it is destroyed - Game Over, buddy. So don't get to focused on possessing your favourite unit because excrement could be hitting the proverbial fan over on the other side of your base.While your HQ is still functioning, you can spend points you earn in combat on special abilities like artillery strikes, strafe runs (which are really really useful later on!) and a precision sniper shot (which feels less useful than possessing a sniper unit and taking the shot manually, but I digress). You can also assign your medics to retrieve and treat enemy combatants for extra points you can spend on murdering other enemy combatants! Delicious irony.There's no campaign mode yet, just a (pretty good) tutorial and Freeplay mode with 4 maps (Forest, Desert, City, and Night-time Tundra). I like desert, where I can really get my long distance snipe on!TL;DR:Is it worth buying?Yes.Will it get better?Probably.Is it still worth it even if it doesn't get better?Yes.What about your opinions on Dean Hall?Irrelevant."

I'm not really into tower defense but ended up really enjoying this probably because it plays more like an RTS and the mechanics during possession of troops feel fantastic.Fell in love the first time I was reloading the sniper rifle while rockets were flying past my head and heard gunfire behind me on the other side of my base; popped out and possessed a rifleman and grenaded the whole group into a satisfying slurry of red pixels. I'm probably terrible as #-of-waves-completed go but damn if I don't feel like a badass regardless."

This game is so perfectly suited to room-scale VR. On one hand you are an omniscient commander standing waist-deep in the map, able to place defensive structures and see/prepare for distant marauding troops. At any time you can ""possess"" any of your soldiers on the map, whether they're assigned to a defensive structure (each with unique advantages), at the initial rally point, or any spot on the map you've assigned them to.This is my favorite VR game to jump into if I have around a half hour to spare (about how long I survive a given map after 5 or so hours of play). Every time you start a game you notice things that could be done more effectively next time, whether it's placing structures better, using your airstrikes or other abilities more strategically, or straight up learning to aim/duck behind cover/throw grenades better.The devs are very active indeed and seem to update the game weekly if not more often with fixes, new levels, and new game modes! I hear they just added mortar teams you can position on the map! They are also quite transparent about their plans for the game's future with campaign modes and multiplayer support -- so cool!Anyway, Out of Ammo represents a brand new genre that I didn't even know I was subconsciously waiting for until I heard about and played it!Make like Da Capo and read the first line of the review."

The 'general abilities', like airstrikes, save it, but overall it needs more actual choices, i.e. resources, upgrades, able to buy more soldiers etc.The ground combat is great. It also needs some work, but ducking behind sandbags, shooting the various guns, that's all just fun.The reloading is where it really shines, and gives the combat enough mundane challenge to put you into the flow, especially with sniping. Can't wait to see more.Wave defense is a good proof of concept but needs a lot of work.Missions have huge potential. The sniping is great but the pistol one feels pretty aggravating with not being able to hold ammo.Overall, a must-buy for Vive owners."

(The price may have jumped with the recent add of Co-op) Whatever price it is though, its so worth it. It is, by far, one of my most favorite games for the HTC Vive, if not one of my favorites over all. It's wave based modes are amazing, but a little too easy sometimes. The missions are pretty cool, like Icarus, where you fight as a stranded soldier behind enemy lines, and with just a pistol at night. Makes up for some pretty tense moments. Theres also a test range, which is just a nice place to test out the guns of the game, and check them out.

,Recommended,451840,23576072,"Posted: 15 June, 2016",all,LtTops,"I don’t often write reviews, but I felt this game was highly worthy of comment.  I feel the game is a fantastic example of how a genre can be adapted to VR.  It is a fantastic example of combining a number of VR based opportunities into a highly engaging game.  If you’re a fan of RTS or even FPS I would highly recommend this.I will start with the bad, just to get it out of the way:-	I have an AMD GPU, and it is incredibly choppy. Having dropped back to the 0.1 version it is back to buttery smooth, but it is at a loss of a number of features and improvements.-	It is probably due to my room layout, but this game pushes me into positions where I suffer far more controller occlusion than any other.  Which is highly annoying when you are trying to reload.-	Room size = play area.  This may seem obvious, but I’m currently set up in my loft, and just squeeze the minimum ‘room-size’ area to play in.  You can place objects as far as you can move and reach, so a bigger room = a bigger space to position your defence.  It also means that if you position your defence towards the edge of your ‘room’ you when you occupy that post, you will be close to that boundary and that will be the likely direction of the action.  Result: you smash your hand into a wall when throwing a grenade.The Average:-	With the sniper rifle in particular, it is easier to kill short to mid-range targets by aiming like a pistol to get a much faster rate of fire and correcting the fall of shot for accuracy.-	The developer tends to get a lot of stick for leaving his last publishing house and an unfinished project to start his own company.  I never played DayZ and my review is of this game and its potential.-	There is no option to rest and re-organise your defence.  The infinite archery in the lab has a break point every 8 levels.  I think a natural pause, you be useful along with an option to move some of the defences etc.The Goog and why this is the game that keeps bringing me back for more:-	The controls are intuitive and take advantage of room scale VR.-	It recreates the child-like joy of playing with soldiers, and the graphics help with that child-like bliss.-	The game seems well balanced, you learn a little and improve most rounds.  Equally the maps represent a fair few hours of potential play time.-	The switch between gods view and the soldiers view helps establish that sense of scale.-	In version 0.8 each weapon from the assault rifle through the sniper rifle to the artillery and air strikes are intuitive and take full advantage of the VR environment.  It’s the first game I have actually had to close one eye and line up the front and rear sights to get an accurate shot.-	The game rapidly ramps up the action, leading to ever more frantic actions as they start to overrun your defences.This game is a great example of what can be done within VR, while the graphics may be very Minecraft-like the gameplay is equally addictive.  I hope they can resolve the AMD shader issue, and continue to improve, what I would consider one of the best VR games around."

You place buildings and assign 3 different types of troops to them to defend your base.  You can use points you earn to call in airstrikes, strafing runs, and sniper shots.  The unit posession is what really makes the game though.  For a certain number of shots, you can play your unit in first person, having to duck behind cover and reload and throw grenades.  My favorite is the machine gunner, where you hold the grip button on each controller and aim that way.  In the overview, you're basically a giant, but the ""floor"" is waist height so you don't have to kill your legs or back reaching down everywhere.There's not a whole lot of complexity once you've figured out the basics, and you end up shoving yourself into your solider's heads more and more as the waves progress since your units have a tendency to be oblivious to enemies who aren't within their range, which gets a little ridiculous when you have a clear firing line for several hundred meters and yourt rifleman waits until all 20 of the guys start firing at him before he fires back, but it's part of the game management I guess.I don't regret the price I paid for it one bit, and I've only played an hour at this point."

Leveraging the best elements of the Vive - the roomscale and controllers - you fire your assault rifle, run out of ammo, and have to physcially pull the magazine out, toss it, pull another from your belt, and reload - all under fire. There's also a sniper rifle where you need to actually close one eye and look down the scope in VR - and it works just like it should! - a pistol, a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a mounted heavy machine gun that you need to operate with two hands.

76561198096401871,Recommended,451840,24478933,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,CDC Spender,"Out of Ammo = Tower Defense + Unturned graphicsHonestly most of the free Flash-based tower defense games on Newgrounds offer more depth. Graphics are primitive. There's a handful of reviewers who compare the graphics to Minecraft but Minecraft in VR is breathtaking whereas Out of Ammo is not. The general aesthetic is much closer to Unturned, almost uncomfortably so; a particular mechanic where enemy soldiers stream in mostly single file and even slide prone towards you feels a little too on the nose. But Unturned had solid gameplay, and, despite my deep misgivings about the developer, Out of Ammo does too.Is it worth $20?YES. If this were a mouse and monitor game, NO WAY. But if you have a Vive as of this review, that means you dumped nearly a thousand dollars on a clunky low resolution VR system so twenty bucks is probably not a big deal. Although the controller ergonomics don't compare to a proper gun shape like say, Duckhunt's controller from 1984, or House of the Dead, or Area 51, or Time Crisis (I probably got all those titles wrong but they were arcade games with gun controllers), the Out of Ammo experience is better. And I can't tell you how much of my parents' money I wasted on those games back in the day.And given the state of VR games right now, Out of Ammo really is one of the best. The game is constantly evolving but feels mostly finished, unlike, oh I don't know, DayZ (though in DayZ's defense - not to excuse the lousy behaviour of the developer - Out of Ammo is far simpler and less ambitious)Anyway, you start off in a command tent and get a rack of weapons to try out on a testing range.  The weapons are comically huge which I don't mind except that when you try to ""shoulder"" a rifle, the virtual stock definitely passes through your shoulder. It's worth it because VR resolution is so low and the stability of the controllers compared to a physical rifle stock so bad that you need a large sight radius or else the iron sights would probably be unusable at range. Just a theory.Bullets travel slowly with no apparent drop-off which means you have to lead targets more than expected. But it's all tracer fire so Kentucky windage works well.  In the shooting range you can customize the weapons with lasers, flashlights, scopes, night vision, and holosights. They're all neat although the laser is a thick solid line which is annoying. Imitating real life would have been better, i.e., just a dot on target and maybe a line if there's smoke at night. The ""holosight"" has two dots which is pointless and unlike any Eotech or red dot sight I've ever used.The pistol three dot sights, though, are a revelation. It's the closest I've ever felt to using a proper firearm in a game so far. Ultimately, even in the wonkiest simulations like ArmA which go through great pains to have accurate models and textures and ballistics, you are sliding a mouse around and clicking. ArmA has commands to zero sights, hold breathing, change your shooting posture, but it's all just keypresses. In Out of Ammo you actually need to brace yourself, line up sights as on a real firearm, and pull the trigger smoothly for long range shots. On a couple occasions when there was a horde of enemy soldiers I was fumbling my reloads and missing shots from trying to lay down tons of fire with a bolt-action. Fantastic! Someday I hope there will be more realistically modeled controllers with rackable slides, magazine releases, proper grips, and stocks for the rifles. Maybe foveal tracking can even simulate sight picture blurring since all three dots remain sharp in VR. Blah blah blah, I'm sure no one cares about my VR wishlist.Reloading mechanics also bring a smile to my face. They're oversimplified which fits the game (though if you haven't already guessed, I would love a realistic simulation of real world manual of arms which I hoping the Handgun, Horseshoes, and Handgrenade game will eventually bring) but it's a quantum leap in verisimilitude over hitting 'r'. That said, the shotgun only requires a rearward motion and the bolt action motion doesn't seem to track well. Minor bugs. Left handed controls are buggy as well but I guess like the real firearms world, southpaws have it tougher.As for the tower defense aspects, you setup a base from a giant tabletop perspective and equip various structures with different types of soldiers which you can choose to control in first person. After killing a certain number of enemy, you have the option to call in artillery, a helicopter gunship, or some sort of slow motion sniper I haven't figured out how to use. Periodically you'll receive reinforcements or more building materials but it doesn't matter after about half an hour because enemy tanks will eventually grind down your defenses. In that respect, the game isn't balanced but as far as I can tell, this is an infinite wave tower defense game and so the nature of the win condition is very different than a game with a fixed number of waves. No real complaints. Upgrading structures/abilities like most tower defense games allow would be nice as would more viable anti-tank techniques.Multiplayer is a blast. It's very easy to grief, e.g., calling down airstrikes on your own base, and laggy connections are unplayable, but otherwise it's hilarious like nothing else.Some day those amazing tech demos and artsy experiences on Steam VR will become fully fleshed out but until then, I can recommend this game."

I wasn't expecting it to be so engaging given the simple graphics, but it quickly dispelled any fears I had. I will point out some things that I think should be changed/added to the game to make it better though, since this is still early access.- Add something above the enemy's head to better indicate who the enemy is. I had a couple scenarios where the enemy invaded and I couldn't tell between them and my men immediately, which cost me. There could be a hardcore mode that didn't include the indicators as well.- Perhaps add in a way to use your left hand to grip the barrel of the gun. I was instinctively placing my left hand under the barrel anyways, because it just feels cooler to do so.- Add in a way to move while in first person mode. If I could command the soldier I'm playing as to move while using them that would be pretty cool, even if it was just by pointing at a spot on the ground.- Maybe add some sort of objective other than survival.

,Recommended,451840,23474976,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,IXTO,"definitely one of the more fun VIVE titles out right now.  It looks basic, but the style is definitely a good balance of visuals and stability when rendering for VR.  Seeing it on a 2d display definitely makes it look worse than it is.Gameplay is fun and pretty well rounded.  It's early so criticisms like balance decisions are kind of unfair at this point, but I can usually make it to round 70 or 80 before it gets overwhelming.  It seems like there is a cap on buildings and soldiers you can get and that's where a lot of the limiting feelings toward the end of a round seems to stem from, along with the fact that when the waves are huge bulks of enemies, they tend to just wipe out your buildings and soldiers faster than you can react to it.  This seems like a complaint, but really after 40 minutes in a round it's not a terrible way to have it end.  The tanks are a bit much, especially when you have 2 or more at a time, and the rockets seem to go through the models, so you have to aim at the ground near them, but it's pretty manageable.  The levels in alpha state have a few bugs, but I'm assuming that's why the levels say alpha on them.  Glad they included them to ♥♥♥♥ around with instead of worrying if people were going to get upset that they weren't as polished as the other maps.Controls feel nice, although the hands seem like they're about 4 inches from my actual hands.  I'm guessing that's because the finger ends at the tip of the controller, not at the trigger.  When you possess a soldier, the controls feel smooth, and the new attachments are a neat addition.  The laser sight on the sniper rifle is a QOL improvement that helped the game a lot.All in all, they seem to be updating regularly and have a good concept that, once expanded on, will probably be one of the core titles of the Vive.What I would like to see:  Difficulty choices, different modes (the sniper cover mode sounds cool, hope to see that soon,) multiplayer co-op (which should be coming soon,) a way to choose or change what buildings you get (4 engineer tents is kind of a pain, or getting a ton of sandbags) Maybe spending points to call specific soldiers or buildings down, regular soldiers getting a slight range increase (they ignore the RPG enemies), a slight nerf to enemy fire rates.  Most of this is subjective, but it's just some feedback I thought I would leave here.for the price of lunch, this game is definitely worth the purchase."

Once you get the mechanics, it really flows very smoothly.  It took me a few rounds before I got the hang of seeing the guys coming in and knowing whether to take control of a sniper and take out a bunch before they get to the edge of the base or use a strike on them to reduce their numbers.  Then there's the random sniper or grenade launcher off in the distance that you need to pick off.  Taking control of your untis is great too becuase it's not just hold down and shoot, you have the reloading, grenades, and need to watch out for the rest of your base."

Pick them up, place them where you feel is most strategic. Likewise, troops are choppered in on a regular basis, and you need to choose what buildings to assign them in. You have a few troop types (Rifleman, Sniper, Rocket Launcher, Medic, Engineer) and placement is important.FPS: This is where it gets crazy - you can take control of any unit on the battlefield. Got a troubelsome sniper on the mountain? Take control of your own sniper in a snipers nest, and take him out. The shooting is simple and relatively easy, but super fun. The vive controllers are used to really immerse you int he battle - having to grip onto the turret arms, loading guns manually, etc.The game now has Co-Op support and its awesome - its basically identical to singleplayer, but its always better with friends!Overall, this game isn't about depth - everything is does is simple, but its spectacular fun, and a great example of a game that VR is perfect for."

The mechanic of switching between third and first person views is brilliant. I find myself drawn to taking control of the snipers; taking down enemy snipers and mortar teams as soon as possible as well as picking off incoming infantry. The title still is in early access so I'm looking forward to upcoming additions, but it is definitely worth it already.That being said I feel like there could be some improvements made. There isn't a lot of time to stratigize before the enemies attack. Its a bit difficult to get everything placed and all the troops assigned after the first few waves. Perhaps some extra time to set up between waves, or a way to pause troop movement while being free to create a placement cue to create structures and assign troops, could help in the later waves. I find myself unable to keep up with the waves fairly quickly because I'm unable to get all of my troops in possition.I also think this game could benefit from an unranked mode where players could have more control over the game. I think settings for enemy/troop health and speed, being able to tweak the waves and incoming drops, as well as increase the ammo count of possesed units would be huge. Being able to edit certain aspects of the game could add another level of fun. It could allow for different game types. For example dropping one medic, one engineer, one sniper and one tower into a round with boosted troop health and speed, lower enemy speed, only enemy infantry, and infinite possession ammo could create a last man standing where you play as the sniper. Obviously not everyone would find that to be as fun as I would because of how much I enjoy being the sniper, but if those types of settings are added it could allow players to create their own favorite game types. Just a thought.I have read a few reviews about having certain issues with the game, i.e. juttering, lag, and one game mechanic issue where a guy was unable to reload. I haven't had any of these problems personally. I did have one issue where my incoming supply drops weren't giving me anything, but I was playing on one of the maps that was in alpha. Don't know if it was an issue with the map or not. I did place a med tent between the helipad and supply area before I stopped receiving drops. I dismantled it and moved it but I still didn't get any more supplies or troops. I haven't yet tried to recreate the problem or troubleshoot it to figure out what caused it. But it did make the end of that round come much quicker for me.Overall I can't recommend this game enough, it offers a lot more than most vr games do even with this being in early access. I'm super excited to see what else this game will have in the future. The controls are great and this would be a great game to demo to people letting them see both the first person immersion and the third person giant/toy set perspective."

I'm really glad that I did. This is a top-down tower defense game where you can controll individual units for a period of time. It feels kinda similar to final approach, though it is obviously a very different game. Each unit type behaves differenty and has different mechanics for reloading. They all feel really good, and would be fun enough if that was all that you could do, but there is also the commander mode for lack of a better term. In this (default) mode you place down structures and then order units to man the structures, you can also call down artilllery or a strafing run.This is definitely an early access game, and there isn't much here yet. So far, there is a tutorial and 5 different maps that you can play on with endless waves. Honestly though, even if nothing else gets added I feel like I will get my money's worth. Thankfully, they do appear to be adding content fairly regularly. I'll update this review in a month or so to see how far it has gotten.EDIT: They added a few missions, a couple more maps, co-op and then discontinued support. It feels like it isn't really a finished game, but I sitll think it was worth the money for what it is."

However, it’s just too buggy right now for me to recommend it. It's worse now than it was before the co-op mode was added. Now the performance has gotten to the point where I can't play without getting nauseas. The reloading is beyond frustrating, I constantly have to grab multiple times before I get mags or sniper rounds and often have alignment issues when trying to insert them. And what is with the sniper rifle anyway? What military in the last 100 years has had a single round only bolt action rifle? As the commander you are very limited in what you can do. You only have a few defensive structures; resupplies are random and often frustrating. Left to their own devices your team is pretty much doomed as their AI is quite horrible. No buildings make it through the rocket infantry waves. Medics run off into hordes of enemy’s and get mowed down trying to retrieve solders that have been blown off the map. Engineers seem programmed to take the path that puts them in the most immediate danger anytime they decide to try to repair a building. You will not have any rocket infantry when the tank comes. You will blow up and mow down your own people when calling in strikes.This review is mostly because I don't see enough people mentioning these issues in their reviews, and I feel the current numbers of positive reviews are mis-leading. Basically, I think there are a lot of bugs and performance issues that need to be addressed before trying to add all the new modes. I think it was a tough sell at $15, now at $20 there's just no way I can recommend it.Just wait and check back later, I don't think the value is there yet."

I LOVE the idea and it makes great fun to play the guns feel real the combined use of first person and god view is brilliant and use of roomscale is well donenow to the things that i dont like yet (not negative) what i would like to see is that the weapons get some fine adjustments because u cant just shoot an assault rifle by putting a mag in it.the only thing I really dislike in this game right now is that the waves are COMING WITOUT ANY BREAKS its soposed to be an strategy and shooter game but after 5 min the strategy is gone because there is no time to THINK and if u have to build new structures on the edge because the old one blew up your engeneier gets killed if when he builds the thing because he is the first target.SO  if they would implement that u have to aktivate every round like in brookhaven experiment i would love that but not YET.the last thing i dont like ist the sinperrifle i get it would be unbalanced and op when it would be like the first one where u could kill entire waves as sniper but the new one SUCKS♥♥♥♥♥XD we should really belive a soldier uses an non magazine bolt action sniper rifle in thist time. I know it is for balancing puposes but my idea would be that u have to put 3 bullets in the sniper like the old ones and then u can shoot bolt action 3 times because taking the eye of your target to put an new SINGLE round in the chamber ist useless right now i put the rifle men and rpgs in the towers and let the snipers stay on the ground cause they aint worth the fortyfication nomore.The last thing i woul like to see in the future is that the rewarding system of the game all helicopters are random they never come when u need them (might be to make it ballanced) so this is ok but what is a bit anoying is that the buildings are random i ended up with 3 med bays and no sniper turret one time that is not how resupply should work i think they should implement a reward system that gives u points ore money for supplys  like soldiers and buildings and future stuff like new lategame weapon antachements like better scopes laser sights extended magazines or better ammo like explosice or incendiary rounds.the last thing i miss are walls some mapps are pretty open and every fortyfication game should have walls i think so u can tacticly force them in gates of cause the shouldnt be idenstructable but still would be awesome.COCLUSION AWESOME GAME EVEN BETTER POTENTIAL FOR THAT MY A MUST BUY FOR THE VIVE"

Really a must-buy if you can snag one of these headsets.Think of it as playing with plastic army men. In the commander perspective you set up your base, assign your troops and can call in support. You can also pop into troops to shoot and toss grenades. It all works very well and is perhaps one of the best workarounds to the whole problem of VR locomotion I've seen. The mechanics for shooting are also super satisfying. Shooting and tossing grenades in VR while dodging bullets is a blast.The only real draw back to the game can be chalked up to the early access status. The AI is pretty lame, enemies walk in a straight line toward you and there's not a whole lot of variation. But the updates have been good and it appears the dev is interested in broadening it a bit.Also it'd be good if there were some kind of high score or leaderboard thing to get a sense of progress as you continue to play (as I have)."

The same could be said of popcorn and marshmallows, but when you consider it, that starts to sound like a pretty tasty combo.Out of Ammo fuses the mechanics of an RTS tower defence game with those of an FPS, all wrapped up in an arcade shooter coating.You have the traditional God like view for managing your resources. From this prespective you assign units, build sniper towers, place machine gun nests and call in air strikes to protect your main base from being overrun and destroyed by hoards of cutesy culturally insensitive arab stereotypes.You have the ability to possess any soldier on your team which switches you to a first person view. This allows you to get directly involved in the chaotic action, using various weapons like RPGs, sniper rifles and m16s to fire directly at the oncoming waves of enemy.Now add VR into the mix and you have a truly unique and fun experience you simply cannot get anywhere else. VR gives you the feeling of being inside the game, so possessing a soldier and firing out of a bunker with a sniper rifle then watching a distant enemy head explode into a shower of red pixels never gets old.Out of ammo has a voxel style of art that really works with the reduced resolution of the Vive and is a savvy way of dealing with the technical constraints of the current hardware. It all works pretty well too, running at a decent frame rate even when the action ramps up and the waves of enemies start to overwhelm your carefully placed defences.In multiplayer you get more lag and there are still some bugs that crop up, gameplay could benefit for some final tweaks but on the whole it's pretty solid.What is noteworthy here is that Out of Ammo is an ""actual"" game, not a tech demo or a proof of concept, the like of which we see hitting Steam VR every other day. It is an actual game built from the ground up for VR, it has plenty of content for the price and what more, its actually good. If you own a VR headset definatley give it a shot."

As of the writing of this review the game concists of setting up a limited number of buildings around your HQ, manning them with appropriate personelle and fighting. Sometimes more difficult enemies come. This goes on until you are swarmed.Upgrades on buildings, soldiers, more building types etc would increase the longevity of the game.

Easy to pick up, hard to master and put down.""Out of Ammo's"" graphics are perfect for the low resolution of the current vr headsets. I can see everything I need to clearly at any distance which is NOT the case with Onwards. In Onwards I can;t tell a ree rom a shadow from a person shooting at me at distance. The games don't have much more in common except the clear distinction in graphic type and how it affects the gameplay.Onto the game. Remember that miniature town table that was upstairs in the attic in the beetlejuice movie? You'r controlling one of those. You are normal (big) sized and standing in the center of it. You defend the center of your base town by strategically placing outposts and then placing your small army units inside them.This is NOT some kind of super realistic, hardcore management system. It is more of an arcade rts/tower defense with the best of each category put into one. What makes teh game so good is that you will sturggle just enough to keep up with the waves and have PLENTY of fun options to take them out. They did a great job balancing this game.The best part is that you can even TAKE CONTROL of the little dudes! I personally like being the overlord more but BOTH options are fully fleshed out and fun.Second best part is that it's online co op! I didn't know this going in and when a person appeared next to me I flipped out in joy. You can turn this feature off if you don't wnat this however. Still, nothing better than placing  your units and building and watching some random people take control of the army guys.EDIT: After putting a few hours in, these are my constructive complaints:- Grabbing a clip from your side is really, really buggy and lowers the overall enjoyment of controlling the small army guys. I can sit there trying to grab a clip from the spot I JUST grabbed a clip from and nothing happens.- Constantly looking down at the table makes my neck hurt, a lot.

The highlight of the game is when you take over a soldier and get to use the gun mechanics, where actions like reloading and tossing grenades are made satisfyingly physical, but the actual commander part of the game just isn't all that fun right now.

Adding the FPS elements to the game is pretty cool, but the game really only allows you to shoot when directly controlling a unit.  It would be neat to control a medic or engineer and have the player do something to improve their function.Ther is little structure in single player and is a very basic tower defense game.  While the game can get frantic, it doesn't seem to be doing that by design, but rather by simply spawning more enemies with each wave.  Even the base building is essentially pre-determined as you can't ""buy"" structures or additional units.  You have wait for a supply drop, which never really gives you what you need to survive the next wave.  It would have been nice to have a pause between waves to allow the player to plan around what the game gives you or to allow the player to buy items.Even though this is the final release, I think the game is still unfinished with balance issues and bugs.  Multiplayer missions have a tendency to spawn guest players outside the play area.  Many times I'll join a sniper missions, and I'll spawn where the soldiers are instead of the bell tower with no way to get to the tower itself.  Units (both enemy and friendly) can get stuck or just stand around doing nothing.  If a unit isn't facing the right direction it won't fire on an enemy despite getting shot at.Overall the game is fun, and if the developer improves the aforementioned weaknesses, it could be a great game.  I would wait to get this game for a lower price considering what other games offer at this price."

It has a lot of interesting game mechanics that are unique to VR like the different reload motions needed for each weapon, and a creative way of moving around the map that allows for room-scale.

,Not Recommended,451840,22493200,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,Cyrix,"Yes, I understand that this game is in Early Access. If you think that means I shouldn't care if it has bugs or isn't worth the asking price, feel free to stop reading.Out of Ammo is an interesting concept, but the core gameplay ends up being fairly dull, and the game includes some design flaws that make me concerned that the developer is headed in the wrong direction. As it stands now I don't think this title is worth the asking price, and I do not feel confident that the developer will fix up the title enough for it to be worth the price in the future.The graphics aren't very good, which is obvious from the screenshots and doesn't need to be mentioned much.Core gameplay is honestly pretty dull. You can toggle between basic tower-defense style construction, and controlling your soldiers for FPS gameplay. The FPS mechanics are very lackluster; you can stand in place and fire weightless assault rifles and sniper rifles at Lego people that slide around the landscape and shoot back at you. You hold your weapons one-handed and reload with your other hand; firing rifles one-handed feels weird and I wish they had implemented a mechanic where you had to hold the barrel with your other hand. To make matters worse, you don't ""hold"" the guns at the correct angle. In any other VR game, if you're holding a pistol, the pistol is oriented such that the controller behaves as the grip. In Out of Ammo you aim the controller like a laser pointer, which feels completely unnatural and further ruins the FPS experience. I can't understand why any developer would publicly release a game with such an obvious design flaw, even in Early Access.The TD portions have poorly designed controls and are unintuitive. You receive supply crates designed to construct defensive points like sandbags and towers. You grab these crates and position them, which doesn't sound too bad but is somehwat clunky in practice. You can click on defensive points to assign soldiers to them, or click on soldiers to ""possess"" them and enter the aforementioned FPS mode. When you click on something, a floating menu appears over it. For some reason the floating menu scales and rotates as you move your head, which is disorienting and nauseating. Every other VR title leaves menus floating in a fixed position in 3D space. I don't know why the developers for Out of Ammo went out of their way for a system that is worse.Since the gameplay is very unintuitive, there is a long narrated tutorial. The tutorial is buggy, with some lines of instruction getting cut off. At one point, after the narrator tells you how to reload, there is literally 30 full seconds of the narrator breathing and shuffling some things on his desk before the narration continues. I wasn't able to complete the tutorial because I reached a point where the narrator was telling me to position the rest of my emplacements and soldiers, but I didn't actually have any emplacements or soldiers left to position.The developers didn't implement any functionality for the Vive's app-menu button and AFAIK there is no way to quit a level without quitting the game. Another random complaint - the sniper rifle has no zoom.I know a lot of people who haven't tried VR get the impression that all of the games are boring, but most of the VR games I've tried have been extremely immersive and loads of fun. This game is neither immersive or fun. It is clunky and boring. I understand it is in Early Access right now, but I just can't imagine it improving enough to be worth $15. Furthermore, the developers have expressed that they will never reduce the price or put the game on sale for any reason. I cannot recommend this title. There are much better VR games for your money."

They have a new game out and if their handling of Out of Ammo is any indication they are going to be just as whiny, thin-skinned and vindictive to their customers as they were with this game. If there was a way to review *developers* I'd do that but since there isn't all I can say is while the game might be ok, good even, the handling by those in charge of said game leave a lot to be desired."
