,Recommended,451880,22362874,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,🍒 Lilly (🌸◠‿◠),"I was really excited when I first saw the store page of ""Catch a Falling Star"", because it seemed to be exactly my kind of game: cute and colorful graphics that can cheer you up after a long day at work, relaxed gameplay. Thus I bought it right away and not only did it not disappoint my expectations, it even exceeded my expectations in a few aspects.The gameplay is minimalistic and for some people it can easily border on boring. You collect stars that you can turn in for points, trying at all costs to avoid the ice that slows you down or the negative powerups. Sounds trivial, doesn't it? And it is, if you decide to not go for the achievements that require you to obtain a score of at least 4000/5000, since 4000 is the point in which hell starts to unleash: the stars' speed increases a lot, making it quite challenging to avoid the ice and the negative powerups. If you do decide to go for these achievements, you'll probably often find yourself sweating, trying to beat your previous score in order to improve your position on the leaderboards; however, the feeling when you manage is quite rewarding.Other achievements require you to collect coins that drop randomly, most of the times quite far from the star that you are supposed to catch. I found this to be a real exercise in tempering my gamer greediness, since I often had to make decisions like: ""ohhhh such a shiny coin!!! do I go for it with the price of losing a life? or do I go for the star, letting the coin die?""; and of course, by the time I decided, both the star and the coin were lost... However, looking back, I find all of this to be a very fun experience.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658998310Another positive experience that I had with the game is related to the attitude of the developers towards their players - I don't recall meeting nicer devs on Steam than the Alister Software team. They are very open to the players' feedback and their response time on the forum and in updating the game according to this feedback is very quick (for example the few bugs that occurred right after the release were fixed in a matter of hours; they also removed some of the achievements as demanded by the players, on the ground of being a bit too grindy; at the time of writing this review, they are working on integrating new features requested by the player base). They are actively oriented towards improving the quality of their game and for this they have my deepest respect and gratitude.Price-wise, I consider the asking price for this game to be rather modest, but on a positive side, it makes this little gem accessible to more people.More reviews on theLilly's Corner Curator page"
,Recommended,451880,25623670,"Posted: 21 September, 2016",all,Elven Star,"'Catch A Falling Star' was initially off putting to me as I tend to avoid clicker style games. After viewing the video and seeing multiple friend's reviews about it I decided to get the 99 cent game. 8 hours of teeth gritting, leaning in the direction the star is falling, and collecting tea cups full of stars later, I feel I can give my impressions about it.The fun of this game is held entirely by it's connections to Steam and Steam achievements for me, aside from the aesthetic appeal of bright, colorful and cute graphics. Without the goal set for me to achieve 5000 points, open up all the basket options, and save up 2,500 coins I might have stopped playing this game hours ago. The game is deceptively challenging behind it's simplicity. There are many techniques one begins to learn as you crawl up the point gain to combat ice, catch a star, and use the very edge of your bucket to bounce a negative power up. Some of the negative (red) power ups begin to seem appealing as one can use them strategically. The game also seems to completely change after hitting 2K, 2.5K, and 3K points, but I can't be exact in what numbers bring about this change. Suddenly stars are dropping more quickly and on opposite sides of the map. I can go from a full bar of health that I've built up until this part of the game and drop out before I can deposit a bucket of stars. So after I've almost reached every achievement and definitely gotten my money's worth of playtime and entertainment from this game, an entirely new challenge appears out of the woodwork.The graphics and music are also pleasant. I have really enjoyed getting the Steam badge and emoticons. They are the same appealing graphics of the game and quite affordable for those interested. My favorite background being 'Japan' which is pink cherry trees with a lovely mountain backdrop. I also like the teacup, coffee cup, suit case, present box, cookie jar, and most of the other cute baskets. The other unlockable backgrounds were unremarkable to me, although I can see the appeal for fans of those games they represent. My only other qualm would be that not all functions seem to be fully available yet, such as the 'Bubble Time' power up which doesn't seem to do anything when caught as of this review. I can foresee this power up being a game changer once it is instilled.Overall, 'Catch A Falling Star' is affordable, a boredom killer, “relaxing” for some (ha, not me!), a hidden challenge and something worth playing."

You control your slow-moving basket with arrow keys or a gamepad, collecting stars and avoiding ice. There are some powerups... The music is ambient and pretty nice. The price is right, until you consider that there used to be hundreds of flash games like this to play for free.I know I feel like a relaxing game from time to time, but there just isn't enough meat here to endorse it. I would give this game a ""side thumb"", but I cannot. For a buck, if it looks like something you'd like, get it I guess. It seems most of the positive reviews are from achievement hunters, which I couldn't care less about. The leaderboard also appears to be hacked, so arcade old-timers like me: don't bother."

It is a world where the only worry is whether you can reach the next star, and progression means collecting every basket and background theme. What you see from the Store page’s trailers and screenshots is exactly what you get.GameplayCatching StarsThe goal of this game is to catch falling stars and deposit them on either side of the screen to increase the overall score. A basket can only carry a specific number of stars before it is required to be emptied (the game will notify you and slow down time when the basket is full). Falling powerups, powerdowns, ice, money and changing wind speeds prevent this game from being a truly mindless task.With a set amount of health, failing to catch a star detracts a pip of health, continuing until there is no more health and the game ends. With a set basket speed, this forces the gameplay to be extremely simple (no multiple falling stars). In a tight spot, the basket can bump stars off the edge of the screen to prevent the loss of a life.There is a score bonus for depositing a full basket. Using a M&K setup, the “shift” button can be held down to disable depositing if the basket is getting too close to the edge. It may be important to know that the basket is also not controlled by the mouse. Again, there is a set basket speed (although it may increase or decrease due to powerups/downs).Star CoinsStar Coins are received by performing certain actions in-game (bumping ice) or by catching falling Star Coins. These coins are used to: unlock additional baskets/background themes, purchase powerups/star bubble shields, or upgrade the basket capacity. Unfortunately, baskets and background themes are randomly selected when unlocked.PowerupsSingle-use, limited-time powerups can be purchased before the start of a game. They may also be caught while playing, along with their negative versions, powerdowns. A list of powerups are provided below.Faster basket.Less Ice.No Wind.Slow  Stars.ConclusionCurrent State of the GameSince the release of the game at the end of March, player feedback has brought forth an update released a couple weeks ago addressing concerns about achievement grinding. In this update, star coins are now easier to attain, and two themes and corresponding soundtracks were added. Although the achievements are still a bit of a grind, it is a major motivation for replayability.Advised SuggestionsThere are a couple suggestions that may improve gameplay listed below.If a star is caught while the basket is on the edge, immediately deposit that new star.Allow the player to select what to unlock.VerdictCatch a Falling Star satisfies the requirements of a casual time sink – motivation to revisit the game, mindless/near-effortless gameplay, and relaxing aesthetics. The game’s re-playability in an effort to: earn achievements, unlock items, and move up on the leaderboards earn it a recommendation for anyone wanting to get a break from the norm. Especially if the game is on sale/discounted from purchasing the above bundle.Before You Buy– analyses of newly released indie games"

,Recommended,451880,22174200,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,MJ (◡‿◡✿),"Catch a Falling Star describes itself as ""casual and relaxing,"" and it's definitely telling the truth. As an autistic person with anxiety, I'm always on the look out for games I can play when I'm stressed out but don't want to be overstimulated. CaFS is a perfect fit!The game is endearingly simple: move your basket to catch falling stars and empty it at the edge of the screen when it's full. Blocks of ice and various status altering icons (which do things like increase the amount of ice, or slow down the stars' descent), as well as the occasional burst of wind, complicate this simple task, but they're not frustrating to navigate and instead keep the game from going stale. Collect coins to purchase in-game tweaks like more space in your basket, or spend them on cosmetic changes like basket and background design.The background music is soothing but isn't going to put you to sleep, and the sound effects are cute without being super sugary. I'm especially in love with the art style used for the backgrounds, which are simple but distinctly pretty, and the different basket designs. Looking forward to catching things in a coffee pot, eventually. :)I do agree with other reviews stating it doesn't have immediate replay value for most people because it's so simplistic, but for a buck, even a handful of plays is more than worth the price."

I wished this game could be a relaxing dodge and catch scroller. But instead I was surprised of the long & empty grindfest for coins and ""speedup basket"" powerups. It has an easy setup: some sidescrolling screen and deposits on the left and right edge. Stars are falling down, on the second wave there are also falling icecrumbs and many positive and negative powerups. Amazing is this wind changing effect when things falling down they are affected by the wind. Also the soundtrack is a chillout loop music. But then you realize to get some of the achievements you have to collect a minimum of 3.1k coins (2.5k for ""Money hoarder"" achievement, once reached spend on 2,2k for 22 different basket designs + 600 for 2 new backgrounds + 300 for max upgrade your basket). It needs an insane time until you can go for the highscore run of 5k points.The gamedesign lacks of certain things:1. The HUD hides sometimes stars so that they appear surprisingly out of nowhere2. The playfield screen is a bit longer than one screensize. So you must rush for alternate falling stars at the edges, there's no quicker teleport from one side to another3. You only earn points for the deposit of stars, not simply for catching them. If you lose a star (life) your already basket  content star bonus is also lost.4. You can bounce icecrumbs and powerups from the side away. Only the icecrumbs are rewarded with tiny points.5. Accidently catched icecrumbs slowdown your basket. So you must get rid of them fastly.6. The bubble powerup lasts just for 5 secs.7. You can activate just one extra powerup in one game.8. You cannot upgrade your basket with any more passive skills but size. So the gameplay is pretty much plain.Conclusion: I feel a little bit disappointed after starting this game and playthrough with 100% achievements. Could be deeper entertainment and not so nery grinding in the end. I cannot recommend it to others."

Otherwise the gamepad works and the music is alright. The visuals are about flash-game grade still so thats not much of an improvement. There are unlockables and whatnot for those who would play this seriously but this is a poor title to have on the PC and is better suited for phones. I am going to remove this for declutter, if it had better production values, they fixed the issue with how the stars fall, and made it more engaging it might be worth keeping around anyways. Popcap made some casual games of that vein and made them engaging enough to be worth having. But this is not it for me."

It seems to have no external purchases necessary, you can make gold super simple!Gold helps you buy new themes as backdrops (and some of them even change the way the stars look!). Gold drops down randomly, and it's a fun challenge to try to catch gold without letting stars ""die"" by hitting the ground.The mechanics are very simple: you move the basket on the ground with whichever keys you want, and you activate some special abilities that you can purchase via that gold with Shift or Y. You're trying to catch stars, avoid ice chunks, and catch power-ups while avoiding power-downs. There's a neat little wind mechanic that I've found useful (and good to keep an eye on).There is music, some of which is original some of which isn't, but it all fits really nicely into the themes.It is a delightful game. Definitely an Indie title, as it doesn't come with the bells and whistles of others. Even that, though, is something to love about it. It's simple, relaxing, and very enchanting! Highly recommend this to anyone!To the devs - you've done an amazing job. I'll keep an eye out on your other titles!"
76561198116735808,Not Recommended,451880,33790100,Posted: 25 July,all,NS,"Yet another trading card money farming game that the devs put basically no effort at all. Looks and plays like your average 10+ year old flash player game except that... it manages to be a much weaker game than those somehow. It has incredibly dull and badly thought out mechanics, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile-looking interface, unity engine, only one level (which is an infinite/survival level), power ups that more disrupt your gameplay than help, only allowed to use ONE bought power up per run (as if they being almost useless wasn't already enough), which in turn makes money completely useless after you buy the extra star slots (you can buy backgrounds and skins for your star-catching platform, but that is just cosmetic)The gameplay is pretty basic. You have a Breakout-style moveable platform (no balls tho) that you use to catch the falling stars and additional items that spawn at random positions at the top of the screen and fall gradually in a direction determined by the current wind value. The stars are the only essential items that you need to always collect, failing to do so resulting in the loss of one of the the 3 lives you start with (you can store up to 5 lives at once by getting the 1+ life power-ups). The other items that spawn are ice droplets (which are negative and slow you down if you grab any), 6 power-ups that can be either positive or negative gameplay modifiers, and coins that provide extra score.You have an upgradable limited ""inventory"" in which you store the stars and ice. Whenever the inventory reaches its full capacity you won't be able to get any ice/stars and will need to deposit your items by moving your platform in one of the extremes of the screen (this is when your points are finally accounted for). Every time that you reach the max capacity of the inventory the game slows down for a few seconds to allow you to have time to empty your inventory. The extreme of the screen that you were farther away from when you captured the item that reached the max capacity of your inventory will be the side that provides the 2x multiplier to your points when you make your deposit. Funnily enough, despite the game telling you in one of the tips that ""Going for the 2x multiplier is not always the best choice!"", it IS always the best choice because there is always time to travel to the other side and still have enough time to catch the next star wherever it spawns from. In the end of each run you get to see your score and given the option to submit it to the global scoreboard, + you get an amount of money based on your score, which you can use to buy one time use per run power-ups (the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ones that drop throughout the game), increase your max inventory size, and buy cosmetic items (backgrounds + skins for your platform).There are 6 types of pick-up items that modify the game, each (besides one) having 2 variations: one intented to negatively affect your game and one intended to positively affect your game. Sadly, they are not very well thought out.The 6 power-ups:- Bubble power-up cooldown decreaser: this lowers the amount of time you need to wait to re-use the bubble special ability that you buy from the store.- Ice amount modifier (more than default/less than default): hardly matters at all because it is still extremely easy to dodge the ice even at the max amount- Wind modifier (no wind at all/max wind): higher wind barely affects your ability to predict where the stars will fall, in fact the stronger the wind the better, because that way there is less risk of missing the stars that spawn near the corners as they will be thrown by the wind to the star capturing wall, which automatically captures the stars and does not make you lose any lives.-Star fall speed modifier (slower/faster): this is the worst of all. You would assume that slower falling stars would make everything much easier, right??? it is actually almost a straight-up negative because they didn't implement it properly. Yes, the stars do fall slower, but the spawn time of the stars remains unchanged (or not changed adequately), so you often end up with 2 stars falling at once (which normally never happens). Then when your power-up expires, both stars that are on screen will start falling at the normal speed again and basically 100% make you lose a life, especially in the later stages of the run. There is no reason at all to use this power-up, the normal falling speed is completely fine and it reaches a cap by 8000 points or so (not sure about this) which is still very very easy to deal with, so there is absolutely no reason to get this ""upgrade"" as it will just ♥♥♥♥ you up.- Platform speed modifier (slower/faster): well at least this one actually does something useful. The extra moving speed does help a bit, although it can also make it harder to control and make you ♥♥♥♥ up close dodges. If you ever played Osu! catch the beat, this is basically like having shift held on all the time at an easy map. In this game you don't really need the extra speed to get all the stars, so the function of it is just allowing a larger error window in your reaction time; basically another unecessary power-up. (a legit use of it is to get more of the extra items, but all items besides the extra life are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥anyway)- Extra life/life remover: self-explanatory. the +1 life spawns much less than the -1 life modifier, which is ok, otherwise the game would be even easier.So in conclusion, the power-ups do not help much at all, they are all basically negative or not worth the risk.Also, the way you are rewarded money is kinda weird. It keeps doubling your money reward after certain score milestones in a run, which is fine up until a certain number, but after you cross an amount of points (which isn't even that high) it basically gives you infinite money and you can buy everything in the game with no effort.Does it have any positives, though?The soundtrack is alright, some backgrounds are beautiful and the gameplay can be fun/relaxing for 30mins or so while you enjoy all the tracks available and take your time to realize that the game is nothing but a very mediocre browser/mobile game. If you don't mind the fact that it is a bad and extremely easy game and you just want to zone out and waste your time with something without thinking much, i guess it is an okay game. Also very easy to get 100% achievements if that is your thing."

Firstly the gameplay itself is quite repetitive as its simplicity prevents it from having much depth: this is made somewhat worse by the first five minutes of each match, where stars fall down in a slow, bland fashion. Secondly, well, sometimes the star spawning will serve you with stars that are basically unreachable or put you into lose/ lose situations: examples are stars spawning on complete opposite sides (sometimes 2-3 times in a row) or situationsa where you'll have to get an ice chunk to reach a star (making you slower and thus ultimately unable to get it).The lose-lose situations might be lessened if you decide to use your hard-earned currency to buy powerups rather than wait for them to fall from the sky. It's possible that activating a ""basked speed up"" bonus at the right time'd make certain star spawns possible but I question the need for such a system to be there when things'd easily be solved by simply changing the game mechanics a tad.Despite my complaints Catch a Falling Star is still an ok, albeit quickly forgettable, game if you're a fan of the genre and you can expect to enjoy it for a few hours before it gets tedious: for such a low price it's decent enough to get a thumbs up."

All the while you need to try avoid catching ice chunks which will slow your movement down.  There are also several negative effects that you want to try and avoid, that are colored red and orange, red being the worst of the two.You start each game with 3 hearts of out a possible 5, and if you miss any falling stars, you lose a heart.  Hearts can be caught in the form of power-ups, but they fall pretty rarely.  Lose all your hearts, and it's game over.The game slowly but progessively speeds up, so what starts out very casual will eventually turn pretty frantic, and while the game is very casual in nature, things like high winds blowing either left or right can definitely increase the difficulty enough to keep you from falling asleep to the amazingly tranquil music playing in the background!Scoring is only accumulated when you dump your basket on either side of the screen, and the more stars you collect and dump, the more bonus points you can aquire.  Upgrading your basket from the default 5 star capacity to a maximum 10 star capacity with gold coins is my recommended highest priority over other things you can spend your coins on that are cosmetic only such as different designed baskets or different backgrounds to choose from when you play a game.Add in the ability to compete with players of this game world-wide to see who is the most epic falling star catcher in the world is a very nice touch as well.  (Top 15 scores is kept)I know, I know.. this is a long review for such a simple game.. but I think it helps you understand that this game DELIVERS for the price, especially if you tend to like casual games once in a while.This game scored an impressive 88% from me in my video linked above, mainly due to a maximum ""value"" score, along with good ""fun"" and ""controls & bugs"" scores.Great job to the developer(s) of this great casual game!"

The game is really honest in its presentation and there’s no complex controls. The store description as well all the screenshots paint a honest view of the game.It’s something intended to be simple and casual with just a small collection of diferent themes and music but a decent bucket collection to unlock if that is your desire. The amount of time you put in the game depends entirely on you, or rather, how much do you want to top your own score.The price tag is really humble and it justifies by providing a simple way to escape from a bad day or if you want to play something without complex controls. Good for any age and skill level, the game offers a small challenge that gets bigger as the wind changes the direction of the stars or if you happen to pick some bad power-ups that can cost you a life or make things slower.Simple, relaxing and good for small bursts between breaks or when going from a heavy story game to another, it’s a safe bet."

Achievements looked simple enough, so I thought ""What the heck?"" and booted it up.Catch a Falling Staris basically a minigame about catching falling stars and scoring by depositing your basket of stars on the side of the screen (On the farthest side, you get X2 the score).  Collecting ice weighs down your basket and grants you no score (unless you bump it with the side of your basket), which adds to the difficulty.  You'll also periodically collect powerups and powerdowns as you play, which can either make things more pleasant or more rough, depending on your preferences.  Missing stars that fall are penalized by removing your HP.Overall, I DO like it, but what I find a bummer is when the game pulls♥♥♥♥♥♥moves by having stars fall out of your reach (You'll notice this more often as your score gets higher), which makes getting some achievements (namely scoring 5000 points) incredibly difficult as it's a game of chance and skill.I don't recommend this title at full price ($1), but I do recommend getting it from a bundle, a giveaway, or a sale (recommended price at $0.10-0.25).  It is, however, a nice casual title for when you want to wind down for a bit.7/10  A nice title, but only when it's going for a nice price."

It is the same, but with nicer graphics and skins and you can also purchase new baskets, to make it more awesome.Catch a Falling Star is a game about Catching Falling Stars into a Basket. You have to collect the stars, but not the ice, that is falling too, because it causes you to being slower and if you let one star on the ground, you loose a life.Maybe not the FPS Hardcore MLG 420 NoScope game for you, but for Alligators like me, this game satisfies my need of eating stars. Every Alligator got this. Some want to eat Speakers and some just dreaming about to nom a tree.So, get your basket and your Keyboard and go outsite at night and catch some tasty falling stars.░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░░█░░░░░░░░███████▄▄█░░░░░██████▄░░▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░▓▓▓▓▓▓█████░░░░░░░░░█░░██████▀░░░░▀▀██████▀░░░░"

For this price it's a worth-every-penny game, really. Someone said it's a steal even. They are right because you get trading cards too.In this game you have a basket, catch stars and try not to miss any. It's like playing Pokemon. You gotta catch them all. You can catch coins which appear from time to time. They are the currency in the game. With them you buy new baskets/backgrounds, as well as abilities. Although if you're playing for high score I suggest skipping these coins as sometimes you can pick only a coin or a star, but not both. So if you chose a coin you may lose a life. Of course, sometimes you can get both but sometimes you can lose both. What I am trying to say is when you play for a highscore just focus on the stars.The music in ""Catch a Falling Star"" it's calm and relaxing, perfect for this game. It's not annoying and I am glad about that because otherwise I'd just mute it.The backgrounds are good-looking. I didn't pay them much attention as I was focused on catching stars.When you buy a new background the music changes too.There are highscores and you can compete with other people. I reached 3rd place but now I am 4th as of writing this review.Overall, great game for a great price. Wish there were more games like this on Steam."

The music is bizzarrely unsettling, the repetitive sound effects are grating, the backgrounds are lackluster, and the pot you control is just slow enough to frustrate you rather than calm you. I hate that so frequently it stops the calming mindless action to tell you to deposit the stars to the side of the screen, or stop the session altogether when you let so few stars fall to the ground. A game like this has no room to be unforgiving when its supposed goal is to calm the player.I hate to be so scathing, but the game is rather blank. It bores instead of calms. There isn't much good to point out when it's has so many flaws and is just... boring in every other aspect. I've never asked for a refund on a game before, but I'm broke, man. Every penny counts.
