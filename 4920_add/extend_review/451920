You can tell they spent a lot of time making it.It's easy to get surrounded and die. The combat is fast-paced.It needs another round or two with the spell checker.It's currently $1.79. That's a large order of fries. Go for it. You don't need those fries anyway.

Congratulations, you just imagined Thorne in a nutshell.  A real time RPG with an enjoyable story, and optional side quests if you want to spend a little extra time in the country of Rowen.  I look forward to other episodes coming out."

If you did the same, you will find this story quite recognisable, but darn you wouldn't expect to find such a good story in a small RPGMaker game. It has mechanical issues but I didn't mind, just like I wasn't paing attention to smelly people in bus, when reading books. The story is worth enduring some inconveniences. People who are refunding 3 hour long indie games after playing them, to get entire amount of 3€ back, are *****, so automaticly their reviews doesn't count :)"

So the combat mechanics is slightly different.Another really interesting thing is the 22 Steam achievements. Although you can finished the main quest in 2-3 hours, I actually spend 10 hours, playing the game 3 times, and trying to figure out all the different achievements. This is because the activation of certain events are not too obvious and trying to figure out how to trigger them is part of the fun of the game. There are also different type of exploration puzzles, hidden items, partial keys, etc, that make the game interesting as well. I loved this game.The only shortcoming that I can think of for this game is : IT IS TOO SHORT :).However, as I understand it, this is Part 1 of an 8 part episodic game and that we would be able to carry forward our save game to the next episode.This is really excellent. Furthermore the price of slightly more than $1 for such a game is defintely worth it!!I love this game, and would look forward to buying and playing all 8 episodes.Keep up the good work, developers... and I definitely recommend this game."
,Not Recommended,451920,23937356,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,GaNoo,"Thorne is an interesting idea for an RPG Maker title. It's set in a dark fantasy setting as opposed to your standard anime looking world. In fact, the world feels more like something ripped from a George R.R. Martin book! So, the setting is incredible! Unfortunately, that's where my enjoyment ended!The English version of the game is full of spelling errors! Nearly every paragraph has a few misspelled words. In fact, sometimes it is difficult to understand what exactly the characters are saying. This to me, is a game breaker in an RPG! If a game rips you out of your immersion, so you can try to decode what the characters are saying, then it's NOT a good RPG. A role playing game, should allow you to lose yourself into the fantasy world. This however does not.The controls seem awkward, and even moreso when using a gamepad! The second battle in the game, pits you against 4 enemies. The enemies are easy enough to defeat, but they are on you quickly. They can and do push you all the way to the back entrance of the map. Forcing you to fight them while locked in the corner since the only way out of the entrance passage is up....and up is where they are standing.Overall, the game had potential, and could have been good. It just infuriated me more than entertained me."

Rough around the edges.Remember that - this game is rough around the edges.On a scale of 1 to 10, it's a six.Engaging story.Nifty mechanics that have been added on.But if you can't handle playing a game that's trying to push it's envelope a bit - that needs polished, but hasn't been, don't play this game."

,Not Recommended,451920,26747149,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,Count Moldy,A lot of problems make for a poor package. Combat and menu's are extremely clunky. Full screen looks poorly stretched. Natural window is tiny and cannot be resized through convenient means. Writing actually isn't bad what I played of it. Payed a buck. I wish I hadn't but not enough to refund it. I just recommend caution before purchase.

You're basically in this one town and you get a few quests (about ten including side quests) to learn some history of it's residents and the surrounding country...the game just felt like just an introduction - there was no real climax or ending.EDIT: Was experiencing major lag - but after upgrading to Windows 10 the problem somehow fixed itself, so..."

Feels quite generic, that being said it\'s quite cheap and for a game of this type it is very well polished, and at the end of the day engaging enough to play through to the end. But i was surprised by the story being all it was which was a bit generic sadly, and i know this is probabaly partially the fault of the translation, but it comes of as quite cringe worthy at certain key moments.I thought towards the end of the story it had some potential to pick up and become interesting and spark curiosity but then it ends. Not surprised, nor am i annoyed it was okay, but ultimately underwhelmed.6.5/10, i still recommend it for the price, at the end of the day i still had some fun."

You can see that some real effort and thought went into character design and a coherent world that reminds me of a grim fantasy setting in the style of The Witcher. Instead of the usual turn-based combat, Thorne features real-time combat that is really neatly implemented within the limits of the engine. Albeit the english translation is a bit clumsy at times (could definitely need a language assistant), Thorne introduces some really interesting characters that make me curious for future episodes. Also, the developer listens to feedback and keeps updating and improving the game, which definitely is a plus."

,Recommended,451920,22443656,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Cielo,"Albeit short, this game was fun. The plot is intriguing and the characters are believable. The dialogue is both mature and entertaining. I could definitely see a sequel to expand on the current plot.The game is a little flawed though:1) The grammar and spelling could use some polishing.2) Manipulating the wolf is a rather wonky process, as he tends to get stuck behind obstacles and keep a rather long distance from you; I guess he likes his personal space? It would also be nice if you could point to where you specifically want the wolf to search within a reasonable distance of the main character.3) You really don't have a need for much of the game's currency (Rowens), as you can often find things to survive by just roaming and defeating enemies, or having the wolf search for things. Might want to improve on that for the sequel.Some optional interaction with the ladies who take payment for a good time (can't write the W word here lol) could be fun too but that feature would likely offend many players.On a side note, the rhythm of the Hornhold theme makes me think of ""Exes and Ohs"" by Elle."

Now for me that's a big one as I've only ever requested a refund on one other game so that shows how bad I thought this was just based on the battle system.Give us a starndard battle system and I probably would still have the game."

I just more don't than I do.I played 9 minutes of this game. Here's what killed an already uphill battle for this title to win me over:Full Screen- although a mouse click was sufficient to make selections in the title menu, I had to use arrows/directional keys to select Full Screen, this was not explained. So I think a good 5 minutes of the my play time was actually just trying to get to full screen, which was found through a forum, and the answer wasn't even, ""oh yeah, you gotta randomly use arrow keys all of a sudden in that particular menu, which is contradictory of 100% of your previous experience... the previous menu"". Nah, man. They dropping some alt+enter knowledge.(alleged)Full Controller Support- so I must have missed class the day that the exact meaning of full controller support was covered, but my frame of reference that was crafted through countless hours in other games told me that when a game says it has ""full controller support"", that it's going to be a seamless experience, probably with such perks as when I flip on my controller, all of a sudden all prompts, commands, etc, transition to be relevant to a controller. Such is not the case with this game. Not only does the controller need to be on prior to launching, I just can't seem to find where the ♥♥♥♥ Q and W are on my controller. I'll keep searching. I hope I find some support.Character Voice Mod Technology- one thing not advertised, but a quirky feature nonetheless, is that Thorne/TheCrow/Aragorn shrieks through a drive-thru window voice mod device each time he attacks. That's just what I'm trying to listen to in an arpg. My character screaming with some mild distortion/static ad nauseum while I pile the bodies high."
