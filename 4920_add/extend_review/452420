,Recommended,452420,31681994,Posted: 11 May,all,泥鰍小妹妹,"As someone who absolutely loves games in all their forms, it's hard to be so harsh on Koihime Enbu. It offers up a combination of buxom young women and ancient Chinese literature that I'm certain would have never been made in the west. However, content is light and as such, the characters don't shine as much as they could without prior knowledge of their personality and mannerisms. Koihime Enbu is a fun purchase if you're a big time fighting game fanatic, but it's hard to recommend it to the average consumer.Featuring 13 fighters and 7 assist characters, I quickly got a strong vibe of Nitro + Blasterz as soon as I booted the game up. The visual flare is also strikingly similar. In a world where new fighting games are dropping left and right, it takes something to truly stand out in the genre. Koihime seems to want their bullet point to be simplicity. The game features a four-button setup, with three attacks: light, medium, and heavy, and one dedicated throw button.There is no tutorial, something most fighting games these days seem to be lacking, but once I started digging I found out why. Every character in the game has exactly the same moveset. Every special move is pulled off with the same combination of moves, and even the finishing attacks are all the same layout. It is designed so that players can jump back and forth between characters without worrying about memorizing a long string of inputs. It’s brilliant, but sadly never advertised, and being only on PC in the states doesn’t help either.Cons of this gameThe game features three playable modes: Arcade Mode, Versus Mode, and Training Mode. This brings up another portion of the game that I found frustrating, though. Some of the modes that are supposed to be multiplayer did not allow my friend and I to play together locally. I was trying to play on my Xbox controller while she played on the keyboard, but there was something strange happening that did not allow for us to play that way. Perhaps for certain modes you can only play with two controllers or both on keyboard, but either way this seemed strange to me and the game provided no indication either way. We were only able to play on versus mode in the end.One other thing that Koihime shakes up is that pretty much all characters have the exact same super move and desperation inputs, and many of the specials also adhere to these same principles. They won’t result in the same attacks, of course, but the command inputs are standard across the board, so it’s less likely for players dabbling with multiple characters to suddenly forget how to pull off super moves at inopportune moments. Even so, the characters all feel reasonably unique—a similar control scheme doesn’t lead to everyone feeling the same.ConclusionKoihime Enbu’s a decent little brawler, though it doesn’t do enough to stand out from the crowd apart from its all-female cast. As such, it comes moderately recommended for fighting game enthusiasts who want to jump into something new, but it’s a much harder sell to a more casual demographic.Pros:-Unique Art Style-Unique premiseCons:-Rough art style and animations give the impression of an amateur passion project-Lacking in content- Asking price is rather hefty for what is offeredMy Verdict 2.5/5The whole situation has me at war with myself; I want to love it because the world it creates seems so fun, but the end results of the negatives adding up make it feel like an amateur overcharging for their passion project."
,Not Recommended,452420,23916185,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,kickababy,"I just want to start this off by saying this is a fun game to play with your friends. I'm keeping it because I can never have too many fighting games, and the variety in weapons makes it fun to pair up different characters in combat.That being said, I don't recommend this game for the following reasons:-Insane difficulty curve in story mode. You start your journey fighting ridiculously easy enemies in the beginning, which progressively get tougher as it goes on. In essence, this means the first few fights are just busy work until you meet an enemy that's actually a challenge and fun to play. Then, by round 6 or 7, you're up against this impossible bot that barely lets you touch the ground and always guards. It's not impossible I'm sure, but I'm willing to bet this is a ""Japanese gamers are God"" thing. If you don't believe me, just Google ""Koihime Enbu difficulty change"" or ""Koihime Enbu story difficulty"" and you'll see how many people have a problem with this.-Doesn't automatically send you back to character select after a versus fight. This might seem like a small problem, but if you're playing a lot of matches in versus and want variety, this is super annoying and I don't see why this is a problem at all. Can you think of any fighting game that takes this approach?-/+Art style. Meh, I've seen a lot better anime arts, there isn't much depth to the design besides ""anime girl."" Comparing it ot the greats like Guilty Gear, Blazblue, etc. you start to realize just how bland the art actually is. I do like the bright colors though, it's less cluttered, so I suppose this really boils down to personal preference.All in all, there's better stuff out there, but the game still has fun combat mechanics. If you're looking for a change of pace then go for it, but if you're looking for a really solid fighting game I don't think this is it."

It plays very similar to SAMURAI SHOWDOWN when it comes to footsies and the HEAVY damage as punishment if you commit a reckless mistake, with more that just a simple fierece slash(the ""hiougi system"" combo counter). Its quite accessible from newbs to veterans, and the online netcode(delay based) is really good comparable to Blazblue when it comes to performance.In conclusion if you're not into fancy combos ,but relies mostly on footsies this game is for you."

The combat revolves around the basics, meaning knowing when to charge in or hold back and being able to string in small combos whenever the opportunity presents itself, will earn you victory. Like most Anime-style fighters you are able to combine dizzyingly long combos but it requires to make use of the high-risk, high Reward Fatal Counter system. The Fatal Counter system can be triggered by counter-attacking with Slow/Heavy attacks that  give opponents a larger window of opportunity for quick jabs+special moves, showing the need for patience and proper timing.Like most fighters nowadays, Koihime Enbu has a training mode in which players can test out moves against CPU opponents in a variety of situations (crouching, jumping ect...) The training mode also acts as the challenge mode that goes from basic special moves to longer complicated combos.Each character has a limited but diverse moveset which can be used with different tactics, giving each character a unique feel. Along with the 13 characters, there is also a choice between 2 tacticians per faction Shoku (Kan'u, Bachou ,Chō'un, Chōhi),  Gi (Sōsō, Kakōton, Kakōen, Gakushin) and Go (Sonken, Sonshōkō, Kannei, Shūtai) with the exception of Ryofu who only gets 1. Tacticians can fit a variety of purposes from being able to prolong combos  to the ability to create an opening needed to gain ground.There is a scenario mode that includes dialogue before and after a fight that can somewhat show the relationship between characters, but in order to fully understand, prior knowledge from the Visual novels (or anime at least) is required. By completing a Character scenario you are rewarded with an event and a gorgeous CG that will be added to the  In-game gallery.Overall, Koihime Enbu is a solid 2D fighter thats great for beginners and advanced players, being able to teach the core skills needed in any fighting game and still provide a decent challenge."

76561198053933392,Recommended,452420,29241226,Posted: 13 January,all,PurplePony,"A peculiar ""fanservice"" fighting game that serves as a spin-off to a much larger franchise I do not know or care much about.Rather than most game that go for for similiar visuals styles to Kohime Enbu this game is more ""grounded"" or basic 2D fighting with a heavy use of weapons. Basically it feel a bit like The Last Blade. I am not at all interested in the stories of these character so I cannot tell you how faithful it is to the original Romance Of The Three Kingdoms story. What I can say is for an anime-like take on it I think it's cool how they show the characters original Chinese names beneath this version of the character's Japanese ones.Port is great. Controller support is good. Special shoutout to this games PC port for making its default generic controller placeholder art the Steam controller rather than the usual Xbox controller avatar. I honestly REALLY want more games on Steam to do this for no real reason. Fun game but NOT worth the price. I will click the little recommend button at the button because the game is fun and the PC port is more than fine but I have to say the asking price is just WAY too much. Maybe it would be fine for half the price as the default but they are asking too damn much.EDIT: As of June 2017 onward it seems my final and main criticism of the game has been addressed and the game has been permanently reduced in price. From that I recommend it more than ever. I am not a huge fan of it but it does what it does well and now a more fair price for a fighting game that plays good and looks good."
,Recommended,452420,23103134,"Posted: 20 May, 2016",all,Ari,"Decided to give this game a try since it looked like a basic fighting game and... I honestly enjoyed the short time with it.I've never really played an ""anime"" style fighting game before, but this one was pretty fun. The dialogue in story mode with Sousou was hilarious and the diffuculty actually ramped up the further I got. No longer could I just button mash. I jumped into training mode and despite Sousou being my favorite character, I leaned towards a different one, which brings me to the next point!Though there are only a few different characters, they all play very differently but their inputs are all very similar. The game's stages are easy on the eyes and the music is varied as well.I played one match online as well and despite the fact that my opponent showed that he had a terrible connection, there was no lag on either of our side. Did 4 matches with the same guy and all was smooth and flawless! So don't let the connection meter fool you! Netcode seemed a-okay.So all in all, if you're looking for an easy to get into fighter with enjoyable dialogue and fun characters, I'd say to give this game a try. I'm actually looking forward to playing it some more."
,Recommended,452420,23093202,"Posted: 19 May, 2016",all,septeries,"I was somewhat interested in this game in the past but it was only released in the japan.I'm glad this has finally been localized and decided to pick it up and it's been really fun so far.Gameplay:Has alot to Street Fighter due to it the way it borrows some elements from it such as:Small set of moves but technically doubled if count EX attacks.EX special moves take 1 meter to strenghten the specials.Maximum stock 4 meter that carry over to next round.Combo strings are usually not too long and the longer ones use certain counter moves to stun, bounce of ground, wall bounce or make them airborne.Each character can pick 1 of 2 assist partners available to them to take into battle that use up 1 meter when called to add some more depth/strategy how you go about each match.Pros:+Netcode thus far after 15 or so matches online = Good.+60 FPS+Beautiful sprites+Good art style+Great Sountrack+Online rank match+Player rooms for casual match up to 6 players per room+Easy to map buttons - 2 options to map buttons in a config tool before launching game & also ingame settings. (easily recognized my Hori RAP4 for PS3/PS4  )Cons:-could use some more additional animation sprites to make the movement look smoother.-no resolution option, options available are windowed or full screen only.-Japanese voices only- / +Small cast of characters but in a way its also pro as each one is unique.Closing thoughts: If you're a fan of anime style fighting games or a fan of the Koihime series you'll enjoy this.If you're looking for a deep fighitng game like Guilty Gear, Street Fighter or Blazblue you won't find as much as deph here but it's just enough to keep the game fun."

I first found the Koihime Musou series from the anime and I really love the heck out of it, and when I foulnd out it was also an entire series of games I just about exploded. As far as I can tell this is the only fighting game in this series, and I can definitely say that for a fighting game based on a series of visual novels and an anime with not the beeest fighting scenes I've seen before (still good fighting scenes though, but I kinda watched dragonball and bleach before I saw this so that comparison kinda ruined Koihime Mosou's action quality for me...) this actually is a VERY decent fighting game. Like, REALLY good!!I REALLY recommend you use a controller for this game if you are used to other fighting games typically played on consoles. The controls are very confusing at first, but like every other fighting game; when you learn it's systems your epik skillz will be found with the right character. Personally I main Kan'u but that's just because she is my Koihime waifu. Just try every character and see who your good with. ( ...and maybe see who you like. That is also a plus to this entire game :3)The fighting is fun, full of unique systems such as selecting a secondary character that joins you in battle to be ""used"" in the form of a power attack. Also perhaps most uniquely is that YOU CANNOT BLOCK ATTACKS; but instead you counter them with specific counter attacks. I havn't mastered counter attacks in this yet, but I know it's a thing. Also there are super/finisher moves that activates an awesome anime action cutscene when you do it and it's sooooo awesome.The game has very good soundtrack, not quite what as in the series before but it's definitely fitting and gets you in the fast paced mood to pwn your apponent with the power of awesomeness.My ONLY disappointments in this game is that most of the charecters from the series are not available, and there is SURPRISINGLY little to no nudity and profane action in a game that was based on both an adult visual novel and an ecchi anime.I would really love to see Ryubi, a character from the anime who has a very awesome magical sword and is one of the most important characters in the 3rd season and with this game being more based on the anime than the visual novels I am REALLY confused as to why Ryubi is not in the game. Also, the Nuban barbarians, who are tiny awesome cat girls would have made great secondary characters; as in the anime they had a giant transforming pet pig that was super destructive and I can totally see them just unleashing that at the other player as their special move, and they did'nt get much time on screen in the series anyways so this would have been the perfect oppertunity to get more action of them.And with my other coplaint.......... SERIOSLY!!!!! WHY!!!!????? The anime series involved nudity and shameless dirty jokes left & right so WHY, WHY, WHY, WWHHYYY is this game specifically advertised with it's ""clean visuals""? This was an adult visual novel and a mature series, and if this is a game based on both of those than WHY tone it down!? We have games like HunniePop on Steam now, and you make your Steam game from this series pg rated!? I am so confused and very sad about that. But if I kept complaining this review would make it seem worse than it actually is.If you like the series it's from, get this game. If you like fighting games with something new to offer, get this game. If you are a weeb or an otaku GET THIS GAME NOW YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!!! Over all I think this game is very over looked and a lot better than people give it credit for when they see it in the Steam marketplace and think it's ""just another anime game"". This is'nt just another anime game, this is a decent arcade style fighter with 2 player local support, player vs AI, a ""latter mode"" / story mode for every character, and online support. If you think bad about this game because your not into anime, than please give this a try as the fighting game that it is, not ""weeb bate money grab cancer"" or whatever the heck people say about things they don't like nowadays. If you considor giving it a chance, then at least try it. I definitely recommend this game to anyone into anime, fighting games, or both.7/10, I have my complaints but that doesn't stop this game from being absolutely awesome!!!!!!!!!also kan'u is bae :3"

And I don't mean competitive as in EVO or tryhards, I mean competitive as in ""I want to fight my opponent on fair ground in a well balanced arena and win by my own merits and skill.""It's not even a case of character tiers or any particular character just outclassing the others, it's the fact that the universal systems are pretty weak. Things that you expect from other fighting games just aren't here.The good news is that the skill floor is very low -- you can get by pretty well just mashing buttons, and inputs for specials/supers are absolutely no more difficult than a modern street fighter game.The bad news is that the skill ceiling isn't particularly high, either.Before buying this, consider what kind of fighting game fan you are.

,Not Recommended,452420,31084126,Posted: 11 April,all,Godzilla.exe,"Core combat is fun, core game is overpriced and not fun.For 40$ you want to have at least a competent fighting game. Enbu gives you about 80% of that and to it's credit, that is a pretty good percentage from a relatively no-name series/dev team.The problem with Koihime Enbu is that last 20% is the biggest problem in the game: the AI.The AI of this game is terrible. It's input-reading laziness that you can either trick or get countered depending on trial and error. Without fail, I have triggered an AI to jump for a single attack 100 times. Without fail, I used a certain attack and got hard countered 100 times.There is no variance. There is simply the programming of ""do this move and win, do this move and lose"".That makes for an ultimately boring game.So this game is indeed overpriced and underperforming.I would talk on the balance issues and how there are just clearly better options for characters and assist-characters, but that's all redundant to simple things like input-reading AI."

Just good ol' fashioned footsies.Animations look indie but the gameplay is good. Controls are responsive, netcode is smooth, hitboxes are tight. All 13 characters have distinct playstyles.Recommended if you like oldschool fighters or want a simple 2D fighter to ease a friend into the genre."

The gameplay is very intuitive for a beginner (no seriously) but robust enough for an experienced player. Cool soundtrack, pretty girls, interesting art style, decently balanced roster and roster size and okay netcode."
