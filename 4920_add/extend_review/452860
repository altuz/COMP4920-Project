,Recommended,452860,23489509,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,Vaelsh,"I want to share what I think of the game and I saw that there are no reviews for it yet. I have found it to be a great and intense rails shooter like games you would play at the arcade but with fun but easy to use mechanics. You aim and click to kill enemies, collect cash, save damsels, and collect power ups.There is a great variety of both innocents and enemies to save/avoid and shoot respectively. There are even bats and chickens to shoot along with ninjas and crazy enemies out to kill you. You can save damsels by shooting the lock(s) off their bindings to free them which is tricky but rewarding. What's also really cool is that you can shoot enemy projectiles out of the air as they are coming at you granted you're quick and have bullets still in your magazine. One other fun thing they added is destructible objects like barrels, boxes, explosive barrels, and even things like guitars, pumpkins and boxes of fireworks.I also find it awesome that it seems like each time you play, the route the game takes you on is different. I have played around 5-10 runs and so far it's different each time and I really like that. Sometimes you go up stairwells and fight your way through, sometimes you go through the main street of the time. It's a little different with each run which keeps the experience fresh, interesting, and unpredictable.Another thing that's neat is that you can upgrade your gear and improve things with upgrades that you can purchase with the cash you get from your runs. These upgrades can increase your magazine of bullets, your score from a head shot, etc.There's also missions to shoot for and tons of stuff to do including different modes of play such as Time Attack (best score in 3 minutes), Zen (just relax and enjoy shooting for 3 minutes without harm), Hardcore (harder and brutal enemies), Hyper (really fast and keeps getting faster), etc.Also the music and sounds are great and makes the experience very enjoyable. It it catchy and gets better and better as it goes.Overall, it's a really fun rails shooter game for only $4 with that 'just one more play' vibe. I highly recommend you pick it up if you like games like this or think it looks fun!"

Only downside is that maps get boring after awhile because there isn't a lot of them. The further you go in the game it becomes more challenging and collecting sacks of coins for upgrades makes the game have great replay value. For the price game is a must buy if you like rail shooters.  Recommended!"

Surroundings and enemies vary. You frantically collect gold bags inbetween all the fighting, which you can spend to improve your skills, like reload time. It's a fine game to let off some steam to. Easy to jump in to, wreck havoc for 15 minutes, then go do whatever else you got going on in your life. I recommend it for some good old violent action-filled wild west themed fun."

But you can change the crosshair model if you want (someone wrote a guide for that).- You have lots of missions to do, and can skip those if you find too hard. Tipical from mobile games, but works.- Achievements goes from easy to very hard, but they are not impossible. I had a bad experience where my pc restarted itself, and when I got back to the game my profile was back to level 1 with zero upgrades. I was at level 11 and missing only 1 upgrade. Maybe Steam Cloud would prevent this from happen to other people.And I would like to point the first time I got into the game, I was so pleased with the art style that I couldn't shoot for a minute. I was just admiring the surroundings, trying to find every detail. It took some time untill I got used."

That said at least the route is varied a bit & the targets are random when repeating previous routes so it's not easy to predict whether a friendly or enemy will appear. There are plenty of targets to shoot at other than the humans, some of these contain bonuses such as shields, money, infinite ammo (for a short while) & many others, whilst some contain a downside so be careful what you shoot at.There is a shop where you can upgrade your abilities using money you gain from within the game, so it's not P2W. There are also several game modes some of which will certainly test your skills as you progress through the levels.Pros:Great bold & colourful graphicsExcellent background music & sound effectsNicely paced progress through the game with difficulty increase to matchWide variety of targets both good & badPlenty of achievements to play forLots of replayabilityCons:Needs ingame music volume control rather than just off/onWould benefit from controller support, I don't personally use one but I could imagine that many players would benefitAll in all, a great little game which is ridiculously cheap even if you paid full price, 9/10 will shoot innocent parties again. pewpew"

While the vast majority of white characters appear as rough and tough bad guys plucked straight from Clint Eastwood and John Wayne films (with a few exceptions) every character of color (Native Americans, Mexicans, African Americans, and  Asians) are portrayed as somewhat racist caricatures. While this does not take away from the game's more than solid gameplay it is the one blemish I can point out on an otherwise good game."

,Recommended,452860,26010745,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,[OTG] Languard,"This game is exactly what I expected when I purchased it: A storyless on-rails shooter set in a wacky western.  No more, no less.Mechanics wise the game is mostly well designed.  The shooting feels good, and I've not encountered a situation where the game failed to recognize my mouse clicks.  It has the familiar civilian targets that costs you health, but they have a very noticeable green outline to them so there's never any question of what to shoot or not to shoot.I have two criticisms for the game as rail shooter.  First is the random element.  On the one hand I like it.  With no story at all, just raw gameplay, it needs something to hold your interest and random levels is a good way of doing that.  However, this does remove the ability to master levels, memorizing all the enemy patterns so you can clear the level without a single hit or wasted shot.  The second item are the bombs hidden in crates.  There's no indication they are there, and it is far too easy when shooting several barrels to hit a bomb before you have chance to realize it's there.  It just feels like a cheep way to artificially bring down your health.Final recommendation:  If you like on-rail shooters, this is a good buy.  I mean, you've probably plonked down far more than $2 in House of the Dead or Time Crisis.  I know I have."
,Not Recommended,452860,29075881,Posted: 6 January,all,eXcruciate,"At first it's a very cool game. Very cool gameplay, very cool artstyle, and has that instant fun factor. It's dirt cheap too which is another plus. It's cool for an hour tops though. It's a mobile port rail shooter that actually belongs entirely in the 'clicker' game category since you click for each bullet. There's nothing more fatiguing and mentally barbaric than clicker games. I had no idea this was on mobile prior to buying it but immediately I knew it was because of how insanely priced shop items are and how little cash you get after each round and also just by the way the game felt. I also noticed you can easily die from multiple incoming bullets which are designed to make you take a hit because you don't have enough time to shoot down 3 or more incoming projectiles since they move super fast. That's just how mobile gaming is, pulls cheap moves designed to make you spend money on in-game curency. So I checked on my phone and yep, my instincts were spot on because it's in the android store. Aiming isn't always perfect either. I've shot a red glowing beer mug dead on but it didn't give me credit for it, it killed the guy holding it. Trying to shoot a guy in the upper right corner makes you click the pause button and it is disorienting being ripped out of the action so abruptly then have to re-orient yourself after unpausing. Items flash to let you know they are about to expire but they only flash for maybe a quarter of a second and disappear before you can shoot them. So why the fk have them blink and waste my time making me think I can shoot it before it disappears in which 95% of the time I can't?The leaderboards are the lols too. The top score player has a top run time of like an hour and a half. There's no way someone could or would go that long in a single run so the leaderboards are obviously filled with cheaters.5/10 Somewhere between below average and average. Fun for about an hour tops. I much prefer something like Rambo the video game because at least it doesn't come with any mobile stench on it and isn't a clicker genre game."

I understand the scoring rules about head shots, red bullets and scoring streaks. But even allowing for these the random score values you get for a hit varies far to much.  Unfortunately what determines whether you get a high score after some practise is the random scores are in your favour. So allow I was still enjoying the game I got a bit frustrated after reaching a high score of around 550k.Still a good game though and well worth the money."

There are 3 basic intro rails, with about 5 subrails, should you survive the intial trip through. You collect gold by shooting barrels and then shooting money signs, but beware. Some barrels contain bombs which you definitily don't want to shoot because they will cost you a life. Shoot enemies before they shoot you, and free captives by shooting the locks they are bound with. You also get points for shooting beers in the hand of the barkeep and shooting incoming projectiles. But some innocent folk will find their way in your path. Killing them is costly.Shooting is accomplished by using the left mouse button, and reloading is done by using the right mouse button or the space bar. I found using the space bar easier.There are 5 modes to the game:-Classic - no reload time. Can earn extra lives in barrels, if found. About 10 percent of enemies fire at you, and you have to shoot down the projectile, or lose a life.-Hardcore - enemies are very deadly with many more shooting at you.-Hyper - the speed of your movement, enemy movement, enemy shooting, and projectiles increase steadly.-Zen - no reload time. You are invincible, but only have 3 minutes to shoot as many bad guys, and save as many good guys as possible.- Time Attack - fill the time bar by shooting objects.The game also provides goals that can be achieved, earning gold, and has a shop to spend your hard earned gold in, buying various upgrades.This is a fun game in small doses.

For quite some time I have searched for a game like the shootzone minigames from Thrillville simply because it is such a fun genre of games.
