,Recommended,452940,23259319,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,Wudds,Passed my test this morning first time thanks to this! Every single question I got on the test was in this practice software and I have no doubt anyone else using this will pass if you practice with it too.It says I played 7 hours but at least one of those hours was times I'd left it running while going to make coffee ect. Everyone learns at different speeds but stick with this software and practice your Hazzard Perception with another and you will be fine!Good luck to anyone else who has a test coming up!
,Recommended,452940,23688180,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,LewisLol,"This software has everything you could want for theory test revision. Almost all of the questions I came across in my test were in this software, only around 2 or 3 out of the 50 asked were new to me and they might have simply been questions I didn't come across whilst using the software (I did only use it for 10 hours after all). I knew the answers instantly to all questions I recognised. You can choose to revise certain categories within the test, take small mock exams, or go for the big mock exam which is as close to the real test as you can get! It also incudes the full highway code which is good for revision. In the smaller mock exams, each time you answer a question, an official DVSA explanation based around the question is shown to aid your learning. Even the bonus questions they gave at the end (not part of the marked test) I recognised from the software.I passed first time, I have this software to thank."

I passed mine on 05/12/16, only missed out on one mark on the multiple choice questions giving me a score of 49/50.  I would highly recommend you use this if you're looking for something to practice with.  About 80% of the questions on the actual exam had been in my practice tests on this.I used a different piece of software for the Hazard Perception practice."

,Recommended,452940,24697744,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,DervishMarauder,"Well worth purchasing, contains word for word exam questionsVery good purchase for the (£9.99) price tag.This is probably the only driving theory related product that you will need, I highly don't recommend buying the hazard perception counterpart to this product as there are better free online examples.PROSAll answers have a well written reason that comes with them when you answer a question during practice sessions.A Seemingly endless amount of questions / specific category papers.Pretty reliable progress monitor that shows your average marks against the pass mark.CONSNo way of telling which practice papers you've already done before (out of the large total) which sometimes means that you'll start ones that you've already done.Quitting out of a practice session or mock exam will still get put against your progress, kind of irritating if you like keeping the line graph pretty.Readers discretion on this point as not every body likes pretty graphs."

Easy to use, you can dive straight into sitting official style mock tests- which I did.Graphs show you detailed breakdowns of your strengths and weakness over a variety of topics, and your progress over time. Which is a great way of seeing your improvement and spurring you on. Also a handy ""Am I ready for my test?"" section, which I must add, was spot on!Amazing piece of software that I have already spread the word about. Many thanks for sending me into my theory to pass with ease :)"
76561198078474313,Recommended,452940,23636564,"Posted: 18 June, 2016",all,Zanderson,Pretty good. It has a lot of papers you can work through to practice with and seperates them by catagory wich is helpful when you want to practise something specific.For some reason characters in the questions are sometimes replaced by japanese(?) symbols wich is a little odd but it is rare that it makes the question or answer unintelligable.

I used the Steam version of Driving Test Success and Driving Test Success 4 in 1 for android. This software contains everything you need to pass your theory test, and it's way better than the official DVSA software.Good luck to everyone reading this review."
,Recommended,452940,34509142,Posted: 26 August,all,Jops_1996,"I passed the Theory Test when i was 16 but due to exams the licence expired and i had to resit the test again a few weeks ago. It's great for learning and practising for the Theory Test. It doesn't often give you questions that require multiple answers though, which is a bummer when taking the real test. I smashed Hazard Perception as it's a very simple concept to learn as most of the videos shown are similar to the Hazard Perception test. Additionally i would suggest picking up the Highway Code book or something similar, as the software is quite vague with information on some parts. Overall, great for learning on the go. I would stress that, after passing the test the first time almost four years ago, it's a lot harder than it used to be as i recently failed by just one mark. Don't give up and keep working at it."
