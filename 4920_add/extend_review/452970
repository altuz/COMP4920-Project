Nice self-awareness throughout (AI voice nodded at with a 2001 reference).I haven't yet found all the outcomes but have very much enjoyed it to this point. I hope that the final stages of the narrative aren't too frustratingly obtuse to come across. Even if they are and I give up looking, thumbs up from me."

Asemblance isn't especially polished but there are ideas in here that are really worth seeing. What it lacks in personality, it more than makes up for in a number of surprising moments, and its chase for multiple endings becomes a real fun way to pass an evening.I more than got my $10 worth out of it, especially with the last ending still being uncovered by the community. I can see the lack of polish being a real downer for some but if you can look past it, there's something really cool on offer here."
,Not Recommended,452970,31747182,Posted: 14 May,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"From publisher/developer Nilo Studios comes their mid-2016 effort, Asemblance; a psychological horror/thriller adventure title that has been released for both PC and PS4. According to the store page, this release is the ""pilot episode of a mind-bending franchise"", so it looks like these will be episodic releases. Little is known about this indie developer, but this does seem to be their first venture into game creation. With that being said, Asemblance is a decent effort, but it lacks severely in almost every aspect imaginable.According to the store page, you are in an experimental machine designed to simulate memories, and with no recollection as to why you entered in the first place, you are attempting to escape. At the very beginning of the game, you are thrown into a darkened room with a flashing red light while sirens blaze in the background; an AI voice greets you, and begins to walk you through a 'personal evaluation' that consists of one question. From that point onward, you will uncover three locations that you can travel to via the memory machine, in order to search for clues as to what you're even looking for. Asemblance does a terrible job in trying to tell the story that it houses, and even reading the long, jargoned notes scattered around the office location does little to convey even the most minor of plot points.The three locations grow tiresome after a while, as you will do a lot of traveling back and forth between them to try and progress to the next ""phase"" of the game. These ""phases"" are activated by simply zooming in on an object and waiting for the environment around you to shift time. Overall, the experience only lasts about half an hour, fourty-five minutes tops, even while obtaining all 4 endings. It's worth adding here that the most convoluted ending to even get is a waste, as it doesn't have any sort of narrative whatsoever.Psychological horror is excellent, it's a true art form and a delicate craft; Asemblance is nowhere near a psychological horror title, but rather it should be classified as sci-fi if anything. Do not delve into this game expecting to be scared, or even to have a tingle sent up your spine; it's a very brief walking simulator at best, at worst it's a waste of half an hour, and to put it bluntly... it's just plain boring. As mentioned prior, the storytelling is atrocious, the locations are too few, the environments are plain, and the endings aren't worth the effort they require to unlock. The only thing this release has going for it is the fact that it is well optimized. Even at the sale price of $4.39 CAD, Asemblance is not recommended by any means, your time is better spent elsewhere.Rating:2.0/5.0- It's not awful, but it's not great.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"
,Recommended,452970,23698538,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,Slimer509,"Asemblance is a great puzzly atmospheric story game. It actually reminds me a lot of The Stanley Parable, if you've ever heard of that; the game is based around finding all the different endings, some harder than others, and the game cannot be fully enjoyed without detailed analysis and reading in between the lines. However, unlike The Stanley Parable, the game does not have a set of several straight-forward endings; even the easiest ending to find is layered behind nonlinear puzzle solving.The game has a great atmosphere (I would describe as more suspenseful than scary, to anyone who's worried about that) and an enigmatic, engaging plotline that drove me forward and motivated me to find all the endings, no matter how long it would take.Here's how the puzzle solving works, by the way: you are given several maps to work with. At any given point, there is typically a place you need to go and something you need to do, which will usually result in a clue as to the next place to go and the next thing to do. Except it's twenty times more confusing than that.If it isn't obvious at this point, the game is more story-driven than gameplay-driven, so if you aren't someone who likes that sort of thing, don't but this.Overall, I think Asemblance is a really great work of art. Ten outta ten. Great job."

It wasn't a books worth of story but it's certainly something you could make a book out of.The game is stunningly beautiful, it looks extremely realistic.The voice acting is good.Now, why do I not recommend you purchase this game?Because to complete the game, to actually do all of the story you need to either be literal genius or you have to look up a guide.You can't figure the puzzles out casually, well, some you can but I'd say 30-40% of the game requires you to be very smart to figure out, and the last 10% requires you to be extremely smart, or that you watch a guide.This is a though one, because I enjoyed the game but it doesn't feel right to me that I NEED to look up a guide to complete the game.And the game isn't long in terms of content, it is long, for the person who doesn't use guides, in terms of doing the same thing over and over until you finally figure it out, and to be honest the reward isn't that great considering time invested.The reward is an achievement and a sigh of relief, ""Finally... I got it."" and then you get a bit worried as you find out you're missing 1 last achievement."

I had no idea what I went into, nor did I know anything prior to two days ago, and honestly it took me two days to go through more than twenty minutes of it because I'm a big scaredy-cat.The visuals are gorgeous, the story (of what I understood so far) is great, and the sound effects are fantastic. The gameplay is simple and straighforward, and there are lots of things you can look into.There's a lot of pacing around, and the voice lines can get quite repetitive if you're stuck (which is inevitable), which could make some people bored and frustrated, and that is entirely understandable.I still have more to explore and understand before I've fully completed the game, and I'm really looking forward to what's next to come in this mind-bending franchise."

The day of its release, I began to fear that I had overhyped myself and that I would be let down. I couldn't have been more misguided. Although the base game is relatively short, the graphics and psychological ""puzzles"" (for lack of a better term) make the $10 price tag an easy sell, and the depth of the ""end game"" (once again, for lack of a better term) still has me searching for answers. There are multiple endings. I will continue to play through this game to find the answers and understand the story in its entirety, even if it drives me insane. I am over 6 hours into this game and I am still missing 1 ending. Looking forward to future episodes like this!"

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Asemblance is a first-person, psychological thriller that uses environmental puzzles to progress through the story.The game takes place inside of a memory simulating machine, and you have no recollection about why you entered or how to get out. The experience is a bit of a mind bending one; I really like the concept of the memory machine, and having to learn about things with no idea of what is really going on. The gameplay is mostly walking around, zooming in on objects, reading documents for more information, and searching for your next objective.Pros:the environments look greatthe story is intriguing, and you will likely want to know moregood soundtrack overall that fits the game nicelythe voice dialog throughout the game is done well, and provides some hints (sometimes vague though)solid concept with the memory machine, and the 5 different endings tell you more about the storyCons:the entire game only takes place in a few small areas, and you have to perform the proper sequence of events in these areas to trigger each ending - it gets tediousminor issue where there are sometimes long pauses with no music before the audio loops again, and other times there is only white noise sounds instead of any music at allyou will spend a lot of time zooming in on objects, hoping you find something to help point you in the right direction - this game requires you to have a lot of patience while you try to figure things outthe dialog also gets repetitive if you get stuck (which I expect most people will be at some point in the game)despite the intriguing story, it does lack excitement when you aren't sure how to progress, and many people will likely grow bored, and not bother finding some of the endingsI managed to discover 4 of the endings, but I feel that the game lacks excitement. Some people have figured out the 5th ending, but it requires VERY precise timing, so you will need a stop watch or something similar(see discussion). The thing that kept me playing wasn’t so much of the game making me want to keep playing, but rather me, not wanting to let myself down by failing to find everything. I have tried to find the last ending, but it’s been over 6.5 hours of playing, and searching in the same few areas; I just feel so bored, and I don’t have any real urge to want to continue playing.Conclusion:I’m sure some very patient people looking for a slow-paced sci-fi game will enjoy Asemblance, and maybe the final fifth ending will be mind-blowing. Who knows? But for as much as I was hoping to enjoy the game, unfortunately, it’s been more of a drag to get through all the slow parts where I’m just searching the same areas over, and over again. It’s not a bad game, but it’s not as appealing as I had hoped.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."

Especially since the beginning was well made. You have no clue what happens, but there's still some guidance in the first minutes. However this gets worse, and until the end you get no feedback or information about what's actually happened and what you are supposed to do to advance in the game. You keep visiting the same places and search for new clues by trial & error. It's like the early Point & Click adventures where you were supposed to scan each pixel on the screen. But this time, the same rooms over and over again, each time anything has changed. To me this felt utterly tedious and boring, and without walkthroughs i wouldn't have reached any endings. If you expect any sort of enlightenment at the end - you are not supposed to, as the developers said this was only the first episode. At the end of this episode i'm still pointless what story or message the game is trying to tell, and i'm completely uninterested if and/or how this will go on."

The narrative is revealed by examining the scenery and in bits and pieces as you go.The game pulls a few tricks on you, such as intentional ""deja vu"" loops and whatnot, but it honestly comes off as pretentious more than wholly original. It's also incredibly short if you just keep going until you have pieced together the events of the backstory.It's a nice looking, mildly interesting and very, very short game.But that's leaving out the gimmick that is quickly becoming the main seling point of the game:The whole ""white shift"" ending.This is basically the final little piece of the game, and the ""true"" ending.It doesn't necessarily reveal anything new that you didn't already know by that point, but is more a reward for participating in a convoluted (and even more pretentious) meta-experiment at breaking the 4th wall and incorporating it into a game. I'll be honest; I hate stuff like this. I don't want to be directed to reddit for hints to how many seconds I am supposed to look at a particular wall and stuff like that. It just takes me out of the game and makes me appreciate it less.Some people might enjoy this sort of ""merging realities"" kinda stuff, but I just don't.I also don't play Pokémon Go either - and that game does an even better job at blending a game with the real world than this."

,Not Recommended,452970,24795846,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,Vlash,"TL;DR: Buggy game and boring story with no pay off. There's a pros/cons-list at the bottom.I don't often review games, and I haven't given a game a negative recommendation before this one...Here's my experience of it:Controller issues:I started the game, but the PS4 DS4-controller didn't work. I usually use it for pc-games with InputMapper to emulate it as an Xbox 360 controller. I tried everything I could to get it to work, but nothing worked. I switched to a wired Xbox 360 Controller, and that did work. So this one might be on me, but in general my experience has been good with DS4+InputMapper and haven't had games not working with the combo.Also, the game never thought me that I could run in the game, so I only learned about that when reading the forums about another problem I had... Since there aren't any way of looking up the controls or remapping them and the game give button prompts for interaction and such, maybe they should have given me a hint that I could run at least? You see, the running is necessary for a 'puzzle'.Bugs and crashes:When I tried to get the game to work with the DS4-controller I had to restart the game often. One time I started up the game, it just gave me a error message, but I sadly didn't screenshot it, or make a mental note of what it said. The game worked the next time I tried to play.Next is the achievements... they didn't unlock for me. I played through to the blue part, and I hadn't gotten a singel achievement even though I should have. I tried quitting and starting the game again, resetting the game at the main menu, restarting my pc, I uninstalled the game, then installed it again. Nothing worked. I then logged myself out of steam, and logged myself back in, and then it worked for some reason. I thought a restart of the pc should have been sufficient. This might be a steam thing, and not the games fault, but who knows... I played year walk just about two hours before, and achievements worked then.Game options:I usually don't complain much about the lack of game options, but this game takes the lack of options to a new level in my opinion.There isn't an option to remap keyboard or gamepad buttons. There are probably people with disabilities that need to be able to do that to play.There's no gamma-control.No option for subtitles (though it's at least honest about that on the store page). People with hearing disabilities can't play. I work with people with different disabilities, so this is a topic that comes up a lot in my work.The options menu can't be controlled with a gamepad. It says on the options menu page that you have to use a mouse to change the options... If you're using a gamepad, you can only hit B to go back. I've never seen a game do this before.The only options available are: Resolution, graphics quality, and inverting the mouse.Story and game length:The game is very short and repetitive, and not in a fun way like The Stanley Parable. I though The Stanley Parable was really good, but this doesn't even come close. The story is boring, there aren't anything funny and there aren't a good story to get me intrigued so that I would want to see what comes next and so on.  The story could have been good, I see that there is potential, but they don't take the story in any way to a good place. Had the story been good, I could have forgiven the game length of about an hour (I have more than that because of all the restarting and such...), but it's really not good, so it's really not worth the price (I wouldn't recommend it even on sale). I played through ABZÛ, INSIDE and Year walk in the last few days, all of them short games, but I really liked all of them as well. In general I really like walking simulators as well.I won't spoil anything, butI couldn't get what I think is the last ending and the white achievement. It's an annoying timing thing where you have to be extremely precise and I used a guide, a stop watch and everything, but I just couldn't get it... So I watched the last 30 seconds on youtube. That too was a let down.Pros:The story had potential.The graphics in some areas is okay....Cons:...But in other areas the graphics looks bad (The skybox in the forest area for instance)Bugs, controller issues, achievement issuesLack of game optionsBoring story and the game is very short and repetitiveThe last white ending/achievement timingSlow walking speed (even with run)My grade: 3/10"

This game certainly seems like it has potential to be a really cool story, but never really presents anything super enganging, and the fundamental gameplay feels really tedious.

One thing that kills a lot of 'horror' games (some people consider it a horror, some don't) for me are the jump scares, but even when you're cowering and waiting for that moment--it just gets more baffling, in the best of ways. Just as soon as you think you know what's going on, you're reminded that maybe everything you're seeing and hearing is what you /want/ it to be, instead of what it really is. Maybe. Or maybe you're doubting yourself for nothing.The references in this game were pretty amazing. I enjoyed seeing where a lot of them came from, and how some seemed to echo a theme...I've already been recommending the game to a few of my friends, and definitely will continue it.

It's atmospheric, the narrative (such as there is) is well constructed and implemented, there are plenty of intriguing elements. But there's just nothing of substance in the gameplay. There are no real puzzles, no real mysteries to solve or challenges to overcome. There's plenty of information to be gleaned from a diligent exploration of the game's tiny play area, but progress (again, such as there is) depends either on interacting with the incredibly obvious interactable objects or on incredibly obtuse and specific actions, neither of which create any sense of satisfaction.I bought this game in part because it was compared to the absolutely brilliant TV show Black Mirror, but that's not a comparison that is going to put Asemblance in a good light, largely because it highlights the differences between interactive and non-interactive storytelling. Asemblance highlights the ways in which interactivity actually hampers storytelling, as it lacks the satisfaction and enjoyment of more dynamic games, but also lacks the pacing and deliberate, artistic construction of a good TV show. The story in Asemblance is basically pretty good (although it's no Black Mirror, and some of the presentation is a bit amateurish), but even a much better story would not be able to sustain my interest while I was wandering from one area to the next and back again, trying to find whatever I'd missed in order to progress.If this was significantly cheaper, it'd be worth the purchase, just on the chance that there might be something in it that makes it worthwhile for you personally. And as a wannabe game dev myself, I know how hard it can be to hear that the product you've poured your heart and soul into isn't worth the cost of a meal at KFC (or whatever your local fast food venue of choice may be). But there's just not enough here, either game or narrative, to justify even that."

If you are only going through it once quickly, then maybe it isn't worth buying it, but if you delve deep into the additional endings and the AR game of discovering all the hidden meanings of the interactions, then this game becomes an incredibly rewarding experience."

If you have not played Stanely Parable you should probably go play that first and if you like that then pick up Asemblance. Overall this is a solid game that kept me entertained and I enjoyed the abstract story line

Also the puzzles are hard because the way of solving them is very unexpected, but all in all I liked this game, enjoyed it and actually found myself reading all the lore and bits and pieces of story you get. For 10$ it is completely worth it."

,Recommended,452970,24135664,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,'error1st,"Quite a short game, got a couple of endings within a couple of hours played (which IMHO isn't necessarily a bad thing). Some interesting concepts being explored here, and worth a look if you enjoyed the Stanley Parable, PT and some of the freakier episodes of Black Mirror."
,Recommended,452970,28150810,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,Crystal Voiden,"This is a really interesting game. It is really fun trying to figure out what's going on in this game. Theory crafting and all that good stuff. In my opinion, the dev pushed it too hard in the end. Let's just say that the game incourages you to research stuff, do math and it gives you very vague clues as to how to get to the end of the game. Some people found the ending frustrating, and I get that. So, be cautious, the ending might be somewhat disappointing. Kinda reminds me of LOST.Aside from that, it looks good. VO is really good. It runs OK. I say, pick it up on a steam sale (like I did) and you won't regret it."
,Recommended,452970,26366421,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,White5hade,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and plot of the game. Most spots have excellent textures (besides the background for the forest area..) The music fit very nicely and added more emotion to the right parts. BUT.. this game DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND, don't expect to get help progressing from the AI or in game text. You will most likely need a walkthrough to get the last endings. At least without going crazy from repitition.. and then the AI agknowledging the fact you're doing it and may be feeling upset about it."

However i don't know if I'd pay $10 for it, 200% worth the $4 i paid for it on sale(and got it for free on PS4), but $10? Maybe, guess it depends on how you view indie games.Great game with great atmosphere nonetheless."

,Recommended,452970,34951517,Posted: 14 September,all,Guntario,"This is an extremely quick game. There's not many puzzles to be had, but what's here is very creative. Normally, I'd downvote based on the amount of content, but the content here is different than anything I've played before. I totally dig it, and I totally recommend it. However, be aware that the game is super short and is probably not worth the $10. I literally finished it in under an hour."
