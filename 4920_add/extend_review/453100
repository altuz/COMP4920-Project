So more of the same!Haven't been able to start a multiplayer match yet, but it sounds interesting. It needs better UI though, and it seems like you're only able to join random lobbys, not create your own or join friends. All this I hope is added in a patch, otherwise it seems like a big waste.The multiplayer has been updated and it is possible to invite friends to lobbies. Now if only I had any cool friends who also liked Frederic..."
,Recommended,453100,24011187,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,iAm_ManCat,"This game is a beautiful homage to Chopin's legacy.TLDR: Guitar hero for piano/keyboard based on Frederic Chopin's masterpieces. Director's Cut version has two extra levels and includes Multiplayer.In this game you play as Frederic Chopin who has resurrected to defeat the scourge of modern music. In the game you face-off against various genres of music that have based themselves around his masterpieces by using the keyboard/mouse/touchscreen/midi to hit notes as they fly down the screen.If this game gets even ONE person to take up piano then I fully support it, it's becoming a lost art and there has not been another genius composer as skilled as Chopin since his time.Yes, I do find modern music to be unskilled - That being said, beautiful modern music can & has been made.Play it! You'll love it even if you find it difficult, it's really fun :D"
,Recommended,453100,26702043,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,Snort Cannon,"Frederic: Resurrection of Music is a music rhythm game where you play as Frederic Chopin on a quest to free music from an evil overlord.The story begins in France where Frederic is buried as he is resurrected by three muses who give a simple task, free music and after that you travel around the globe fighting people in musical battles to get one step closer to restoring music.So how is Frederic: Resurrection of Music ? Well it's not bad, but it's not great either.Let me go over through everything good first:The art style is really really good. It's a comic book like style of visuals and all of it is really pleasing to the eye. A lot of care went into creating the art style which is great.The gameplay itself takes some time getting used as the controls are kinda meh. You use the A,S,D,F and W,E,R keys to control the piano and hit notes like Guitar Hero. This builds up a meter on the top of the screen where if you have the most of the bar filled means you win and if you don't you lose.The game also let's you grant special abilities which I'm not sure what they do so can't really explain it here.The game is also rather tough so even if you're slightly off rhythm you might lose the fight.The Music is also really good and I had a great time listening to the tracks in game.Now for the bad things:As stated the controls are really really tough to master and it's really card to hit combos in the game.The game is also really really short, just barely an hour long. But there is a ton of replay value. Completing the game on certain difficulties will unlock arena levels which I have not tried out.Also for people interested on knowing the difference for the Director's Cut and regular is that in the director's cut there are two bonus story missions.In the end I like my time with Frederic Resurrection of Music. It's a short and sweet time and on a sale it cost me 50 cents which is a steal. It's definitely worth a pick up.Final Rating:7/10Pros:+ Great Art Style+ Great musicCons:- Short- Controls are tough to master"
76561198058545947,Recommended,453100,32189419,Posted: 4 June,all,Neosho,"Frederic: Resurrection of Music (F:RoM) has probably one of the strongest premises of any rhythym game. The music industry has become so commercialized that it literally causes classical pianist and composure Frederic Chopin to rise from the dead. Disturbed by the modern day music industry's quest for fame and fortune, Frederic sets out to school all of these wannabe musicians about what it truly means to be an artist. Or something like that. I honestly couldn't really tell what was going on most of the time because narratively the execution is a little wonky.But who cares about that! It is all about the music man! It is the strength of song selection that makes or breaks a rhythym game and F:RoM shines in this department. Each track is a genre breaking remix of one of Chobin's classical pieces. Ever wonder what Chobin would sound like if he smoked pot and took influence from Bob Marley? How would his music be affected if he binged old Western movies for a weekend? It is an insanely clever idea that makes picking up this game worthwhile.The actual gameplay is not great but merely acceptable. Other reviewers claim that there are problem while playing on keyboard but I cannot comment on this because I played using the touch controls on my Windows 8 Surface Pro. It is a nice litte pick up if you are playing on a tablet like device. Other than that, however, I cannot recommend it whole heartedly.Controls aside the story does leave much to be desired. I feel like the developers could have done a lot more with the set up but for less than $3 I believe to be Frederic: Resurrection of Music to be worth your time and money."

The Director's Cut isn't terrible compared to the other version, just inferior. I got the game while it was 90% off, and I do feel it's worth 59 cents. It would've been better as a DLC to add the two new songs to the original game.I couldn't try the multi-player. It takes too long to get into a game unless you have a friend to play with. The global stats for the game suggests that there have been just over 1000 multiplayer games played, so it was likely dead on arrival.The visual quality of the stages feels lower than the original, and while they did add ""damage modeling"" for your opponents when you execute an attack, it only amounts to your foes looking angry or worried with sparking equipment. The two new opponents and both forms of Mastermind X do not have any of these damaged states. I don't think the arena fights have them either.The note sequences are different on for the stages. In some cases, the difference in minor. In other cases, they are drastic. Two examples of the more drastic cases are:1. The arena unlocked for finishing the game on normal has a 30+ second segment of the song featuring TWO NOTES on ALL difficulties. Meaning the correct way to play that part of the song is to sit there and do nothing. It's very boring.2. The note sequence for the duel in Ireland on the top two difficulties follows the background fiddle instead of the main melody. That's several measures of 16th notes on a high tempo song. This makes the song THE HARDEST in all three Frederic games. If this was limited to just the maximum difficulty, I would be less irate about it.To reiterate, I feel that Director's Cut isn't terrible compared to the other version, just inferior. I got the game while it was 90% off, and I do feel it was worth the 59 cents I paid. But all things totaled, this game was a disappointment. I would've been happier if it was a DLC that just added the two new songs to the original game."

,Recommended,453100,26626394,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,tjtheturtleisawesome,"I've loved played the previous two Frederic Games so I thought why not, let's get the third one to support the developers.Now I'm a little bit iffy on this recommendation.To start off, this Directors Cut didn't really add anything much from the previous game except for two additional levels that were squeezed before the boss. These levels weren't as great as the other levels (you could tell from the animation quality) I know Director's cut doesn't really mean a whole new game, it should be the original with some things, but I was expecting them to fix some of the issues from the previous games.Now There are more problems. Touchscreen doesn't work after the first song. Some cutscenes are extremely laggy compared to others. The rest of the game is fine, but the touchscreen part really let me down. Also the mouse stops working after the first level, which aremajor issues considering the game depends on either keypad, mouse, or touchscreen input.I didn't mind playing the entire game again, but I felt like this Directors Cut did't add as much as I expected it too. The multipler part is cool, but I think this Directors Cut needed to be polished more, like fixing the important interface issues (major con)"
,Recommended,453100,23365255,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,WidescreenRules,"I highly receommend this game even with a few minor issues and one big recommendation.The game is effectively a Rock Band 3 keyboard using Frederick Chopin as the protagonist, but with so much cheese that you could make an amazing pizza. The variation of Chopin's music in different styles, including Irish, rock, raggae, and others, is an absolute delight to listen to. The music alone is worth the price of admission as far as I'm concerned, and there are several of Chopin's best pieces to perform. The minor issues include really bad voice acting, especially that of Chopin,  and *really* long (but thankfully skippable) cutscenes. In fairness, the really bad voice acting is no doubt a part of the cheese factor.Those slight dings can easily be ignored; however, (and forgive the caps, but this has to be emphasized):I HAVE TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME **PRIMARILY** TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE TOUCHSCREEN LAPTOPS OR TABLETS!As an amateur keyboardist, I found it very difficult to come up with a PC keyboard layout that was comfortable for me and therefore became very frustrated while playing on a PC keyboard. Admittedly, you might find something better for you. But the game felt far, far more natural when I played it on my touchscreen laptop. (The game has its roots in the tablet arena, so this isn't totally unexpected.) It was much more enjoyable to play, and I had a lot more fun with this game than I expected I would once I switched to a touchscreen laptop.So, if you own a touchscreen laptop or Windows tablet, I absolutely recommend this game, especially for the price. Just don't expect the best voice acting out there and get ready to skip cutscenes. Otherwise, this game is worth the low price.I didn't touch the multiplayer part because - with very, VERY few exceptions - I don't like multiplayer games. From what others have said, it doesn't work all that well; but I don't plan on trying it to find out. If you're more interested in the mutiplayer aspect, look at other reviews."

I found that the voice acting although a bit mediocre kept a lot of charm and beuty involved.If I'd have to describe Frederic: Resurrection of Music in one word I would have to say Charming. it's just charming. The music is great and the control scheme, although hard at first, is really fresh. I would have to say this game is one of a kind.8/10"

,Recommended,453100,31309661,Posted: 22 April,all,Monterico Gaming TV,This game for just a few bucks is fun for the soundtrack alone. Feel like music that would play on my old Casio remixed. The comic book like cut scenes are oddly long for a game of this nature but found them to be funny and added to the game. A nice twist on a simple keyboard tablet game with a story mode. Played with the keyboard and could win on easy but not with style. I think it would be a lot more fun with a touch screen. I could not imagine it at all with the mouse.
,Not Recommended,453100,31680820,Posted: 11 May,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Casual - Music & RhythmAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryNote: 6+ Hours of card idling on recordTLDR: A mediocre game with a few good ideas, completely drowned out in its own design flaws, cringeworthy story arc, incompetent controls, distracting power ups, overused yet underutilized mortal kombat duel concept and surprisingly forgettable music. Very skippable, could seriously put someone off rythm games altogether if they never played better examples of the genre. Could be that this game really is only designed to work with touch input and other inputs are a second thoughtReview: I'll try to be brief. The default controls are madness but are rebindable. Mouse is useless and you may not play with a joypad. Already a bad start. You should rebind it to something linear on your keyboard. In my case I chose. asdf jklwhich aligns with the piano keys as they appear from left to right irrespective of height. This sort of kind of works. Except I have 8 fingers and this game has 7 inputs meaning sooner or later my brain will use the right pinky finger for L and this will throw me off for a lot of notes.The way the notes are presented is ... ill conceived. They went for screenshot-appeal over gameplay and playability. A bunch of white and black classy notes falling onto the piano might look classy but its a complete spathetti mess for your brain to untangle on the fly. I found myself quickly trying to route the notes to their letters listed at the bottom and starting to mentally chant them in my head. ASASKL. ASASKL. LKSAAJ. Needless to say there are way too many steps for this to work in a fast paced rhythm game. Especially with the background being animated and trying to distract you and with the occasional optional keystrokes for power ups and bonus points to pick up with alternate keys.What they SHOULD had done if they cared about the players at all, was replace the note with the keybinded letter, and have THAT fall off the waterfall towards the player, with a clear visual change to the letter when it needs to be pressed. I am very good with a keyboard and completely demolish when I play Typing of the Dead : Overkill. In comparison the sequences that are needed to be typed in this game are childish in difficulty and yet because of the design mess both on screen and in the keybinds I found myself doing very poorly.I've beaten the game on easy difficulty and while it was nice to have some appeal to classical music, an anachronistic protagonist in a modern world setting, and travels around the world. The stereotypes everywhere, the lack of believability of any and every dialogue line, and the ever present thought that the only reason chopin is the protagonist is because he is royalty free for having died too long ago where all huge detractions and make it a very memorable experience but in a bad way, you kind of want to wash your mind off of having played this after you are done.Conclusion : A missed opportunity that does not feel like it respects the player or the videogame medium, music, or even people from around the world either. Someone reported on the forums that on harder difficulty the Excellent message popup blocks notes and the dev responded saying he apparently noticed there is no options to turn it off and advised the guy go back to easy difficulty to learn the notes by heart... Shows you the attitude... freaking mobile port trash"

The 'owners' -90% disconut was a fair price for an 'upgrade'. The thing is - it was a temporary discount, and now all players, both new and old, are expected to pay the full price for two extra songs and the MP.While the multiplayer idea may sound good, it does not really work well. It used to be completely and entirely broken at first, but even now, with all its fixes it's barely playable. Even if they eliminate all the bugs, the gameplay had never been designed with a MP in mind, and 'random lobby' waiting  time is only going to increase.The new songs do not add much to the overall game quality. They are actually weaker compared to the original tracks (with music&sotry&visuals).TLDR- If you already own the old game and got the -90% upgrade - you're fine.- If you already own the old game, but had missed the discount - keep it this way and\or wait for another -90%- If you had not played the original game you may go for this one, but have in mind that the old F:RoM is cheaper, and you won't lose much after all."

Within the game, there are arrows pointing left or right.  I have no clue what they mean.  Even in the Help Menu doesn’t tell me what they mean unless I misunderstood it.Another problem is the bonus letters.  It doesn’t do anything in terms of progression in the game other than build your points, fair enough, but does it have to cover the middle of the screen?  Sometimes tons of notes of flying by and all of a sudden, either a “perfect” or “excellent” sign pops up in the middle of nowhere blocking the notes.  Maybe it should be placed a little higher.I’m glad this game has a story at all.  At least there is something so I see this as a bonus.
