,Not Recommended,453270,24985522,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,mcbean,"This game is not worth it! The game WILL soft lock when you die or complete a mission. The graphics that the actual game offers is not what is shown in the screenshots, and is extremely broken. You will find yourself wondering if the physics could get any worse, and they do. You may walk through walls from time to time and even walk on top of the game's particles. I Would not recommend this game even if you were desperate to play a block building FPS game."
