,Not Recommended,453290,28624187,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Zee,"As with so many interesting games, this one boils down to ""Great idea, poor execution"".  As best as I could tell, for the first three zones (how far I've completed the game), you must examine and interact with most, if not all possible objects to hit the 50% mark, and again to hit the 100% mark.  This effectively means you need to either go up to everything once in a circle, or switch actions without a quick-swap option in front of every object.  Then, once you hit 50%, you have to do it again to make sure you don't miss those last few percentage points.Compounding this issue is a few little niggles.  You can't examine or interact with an object if you're moving.  Some objects look like they can be interacted with (such as a red square in the second zone) but are just part of the background.  Some objects have a really small context zone, too, so even if it looks like you should be able to examine an object, you're not actually in the right space.  All of these add up to what is essentially a pixel hunt in each room, done two or three times each.Beyond that, the gameplay isn't exactly riveting; it's standard escape the room(s) stuff for the most part, with puzzles varying from straightforward to requiring leaps of logic.As I said at the beginning, it's a great concept.  If the developer focused more on the rooms gaining focus, and perhaps having more than three stages of awareness and/or not having all objects increase in focus simultaneously, this could have been a lot more interesting.  As it stands, its unique gimmick hobbles the gameplay more than anything."

I enjoyed the unique mechanic abour being ""aware"" of the surroundings and learning to understand them, as if you were a child unknown to the new things around them, making you want to explore and understand. Should you get it? Sure! Its a good play, and giving the dev a few bucks isnt such a bad idea since its designed well. Could use a bit more content though."
,Not Recommended,453290,23609835,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,Cheerylixilis,"I cannot recommend this game for a few reasons.1. The awareness meter gimmick gets old. Very fast. I can understand why it's there since it's  helpfulto know  if there's still something left that you haven't interacted with but with a mixture  of my second issue it's nothing but a con.2. No in level saving. Sure you can replay each room and start them over but if you have to leave in the middle of a room,  then you'll lose ALL of your progress in the room. Then you have to start all over again which means you have to go thorugh getting all your awareness back from zero which is an intense pain.There is one puzzle in particular that seems incredibly unintuitive and it frustrated me to no end due to one little bit of information that the game didn't give at all and was based on a guess. This may just have been a personal issue but I've seen a number of people having problems with the same puzzle3. A lack of music. There is a little now and again but overall, none of it (when there is any) that gives a good aid to the atmosphere. The atmosphere itself was interesting and got me interested in it but my last point will give an idea why I didn't like it even more so.4. The ending was incredibly anticlimatic. Very, very much so. It made any interest I had in the world, rooms and the like basically die straight up."

In my opinion were the controls not as clunky as some describe, even though they might need a bit polishing. Regarding the actual duration of the game, you might chose to overlook this anyway like I did. (As far as they are not ""game breaking"" and literally only feel a bit ""awkward"").You can not say much about any ""story driven depth"" to this game, as many would interpret it differently and delivering a ""message"" certainly was not in focus here.I hope that this idea of making ""awareness"" a gameplay feature and toying a bit with our minds, making us realize how we actually do see things, carries on to some sequels to this game!"

First off, it's much too short.  Second, if you quit in the middle of a level, it does not save your progress.  Instead, you have to start over from the beginning (I found this out the hard way, and on the longest level).  Next, while the awareness concept is interesting, it can quickly become tedious, particularly on the last level.  Finally, the controls are very annoying.  I would have much preferred binding each of the options (look, interact, item1, item2) to a seperate key, as opposed to having to cycle through them using the arrow keys.  The game is also very bad at detecting when you are next to an item, which can lead to unnecessary readjustments just to get the game to allow you to do something.  In addition, the game does not tell you how to begin a new game until you have already started a new game, which left me randomly mashing keys for a good minute.  However, despit all this, I would be interested in a longer sequel.  All in all, I would say it's worth it for about a dollar, but I would be hard pressed to pay any more than that."

This game mechanic introduces new content to the game within the same room (you'll have to interact with them multiple times because they change due to your awareness level). The puzzles are interesting, with the appropriate level of difficulty.The game is really short though (I finished it in one hour), i think there could be much more puzzles and content in this game. And because I got all the achievements I don't think there's anything new for second round. So it is arguably not worth the price especially if you are looking for a high time/price ratio. That said, if this game were to have a sequel or something with more content I'll definitely consider buying it."

I worry about replayablity since it's a puzzle game, and with only one solution for each puzzle, so you'll probably remember the answers unless you wait a year or so.Artstyle is cute, the concept is great, the progressive fade is really neat, I hope the developer tosses in some free DLC or makes a sequel.I am spoiled with all the steam sales, so I thought 5 bucks was steep, especially for only an hour or so of game play (though it has steam trading cards) but in the end, It's worth it to me, helping out devs that actually care about their product.Pros: Artstyle, Concept, Low price, Steam CardsCons: Replayability, Length, (I need more cons) Backtracking?all in all, I'd say 8/10, Highly Recommended when on sale, Semi-Recommended at full price."

But in every room, there's at least one puzzle that's incredibly obscure and the discussions forum on here is a testament to that. It's also very, very short. 4 small levels that are made artificially longer by poorly designed puzzles is not worth $5.

Some things may be hard/not obvious to interact, sometimes you will advance by accident, and some puzzles may be a little too obscure and you will get stuck (which will take a significant % of your playtime). I just feel you should play other similar games instead of this.It's not bad, though. If you really like puzzle games it's a good experience. But pay attention to detail."

You have to try out all interactions with all objects, which raises your ""awareness"" level. At 50% you start to see the world in a bit more detail, and at 100% you see everything in full detail. This mechanic doesn't really add anything to the experience other than the tedious repetition of looking and interacting and using every object with everything.The game is controlled with a keyboard, and there doesn't seem to be gamepad support. Arrow keys move the character around, but interaction is quite odd. You have four selectable actions: look, interact and the use of two different items. You select the action you want by pressing shift, which brings up a wheel of actions, and use the arrow keys to select the action you want. Some of the puzzles use specific buttons on the keyboard (QWER for example).First, why can't looking and interacting have their own buttons? Second, why the two item limit when the last room has three items? Third, why the puzzle specific buttons? This control scheme is one of the least user friendly I've seen in quite a while.Saving might not be a big deal when dealing with a game that is around an hour long, but you never know when the player has to shut down and leave the game. You may have unlocked 50% or more awareness, but if you have to shut the game down, you have to start the room all over again, which means you have to look and interact with everything yet again.When you get to the main puzzles, they are OK for the most part. Some of the puzzles took some sideways thinking, but I don't think there was a single puzzle that was pure ""guess-the-developer-logic"" type puzzle. However, this is a short game that relies on doing lots of tedious ground work before getting to do the puzzles themselves, so there aren't that many puzzles.Overall, Awareness Rooms is a short, lackluster and not a very player friendly game. There's an occational glimmer of a good puzzle, but the strain of the main mechanic and the unfriendly control scheme take away the enjoyment from solving the puzzles."

As someone that pokes and prods every item he can in games like this, even when unnecessary, I looked forward to my experience.  However, while it was indeed an entertaining game, it was also quite short.  There was only one or two puzzles that took me a while to figure out; I would've liked more of a challenge, but at the same time, the lack of frustrating, obtuse puzzles will be good news to other gamers.  Still, unless I feel like solving the same puzzles all over again, this means I'll probably have to leave the game idle in the background for an extra few hours to get its Steam Trading Cards.  I don't regret my purchase, and I'd recommend it to casual gamers, but hardcore puzzle solvers should probably look elsewhere."

It has a good and new mechanic but the use of that could have been better. Most of the puzzles you had to solve after you reached 100% awareness.

It's basically a minimal-budget indie virtual escape room in the style of a point & click adventure game.  The twist of starting each room unable to discern your surroundings is interesting, but doesn't matter much once your perception reaches 100%, as it by necessity will before you're halfway through the room's puzzle.

Yes it has this feature where you must examine objects in a room to raise ""awareness"" of the room, but eventually by the second-last or last room (and the game is very short!) you begin to get annoyed by having to check everything. The last room especially was so scattered; going back and forth between the different areas was a little irritating.There were some positive aspects of this game, such as the difficulty of the puzzles being just right and the pixel art being of decent quality, but there was no excitement or interest given to the player to continue playing the game. The player is lead only by their curiosity alone, and if they don't have enough curiosity then they won't play the game.As others have mentioned, a lack of music and an anticlimatic ending definitely contributed to the staleness of the game. I was confused on a how some elements contributed to the story such asthe eye at the end of the game, but sincethe whole game was a dreamit became really unexciting-like it didn't have a story at all.

But eh, what are ya gonna do?Overall Rating: 7.3/10, simple concept, yet used in a creative way"

,Recommended,453290,32201170,Posted: 5 June,all,Sorekasho,"A very cute and short puzzle-""escape"" game, despite the shortness of the game length though it still took me about an hour and half to finish, thats moreso due to me interacting with everything than anything else however.The concept of ""Awareness"" is pretty intruiging, how the developer also said his motivation/reason to use the concept of ""Awareness"" makes it even more interesting.Here's an interview with the developer that goes a bit on about the concept of the game.In a sense, the cuteness appeal of the game also helped me be interested in the game, usually I'm not a fan of short/lack of content games but this one passed because of its interesting concept and cute pixel style.Overall, i got nothing much to say than hoping that the developer makes more games like this, or adds possibly more content to this game, or anything else really, so long it's fun and good. They did a great job on ""Awareness Room"" in my opinion, and for its price, i'd say its okay. You get to support the developer at least!- ""What... is this...?"" - Unnamed Protagonist (Or so I liked calling her, ""Momo(ku)"".)"

76561198165996976,Recommended,453290,29576287,Posted: 29 January,all,turner4965,Awareness Rooms is a short indie puzzle game that won't take too long to beat. The art style is cute and the game has a cool and unique main mechanic. The only complaint that I have are that in a few of the puzzles the solution are rather strange.
76561198005727768,Recommended,453290,31103369,Posted: 12 April,all,Icewolfnector,"Short and fun little puzzle game with an interesting concept.You basically start looking at and interacting with all kind of objects in a small room you find yourself in. At first you can't really tell what those objects  are and only get vague descriptions about their properties.But the more you interact with all the things around you the more aware you get of what they are and your ""vision"" starts to get sharper and sharper.When you have finished that task and your awareness is at 100%, your next goal is to find a way out of the room you are in and progress further.All in all I had fun with this game. It isn't very long, as you can see from most peoples play time, you can finish it in just a few hours.Depending on how good you are at solving the puzzles. Which are a nice dificullty for the most part imo. Not to hard, not to easy. The only one I got stuck on was the morse code oneThe only negativ thing I could really say about this game is the controlls. When you start the game you get a little prompt that let's you choose your settings for the game. One of them beeing controlls.But no matter what I changed them to, the game didn't care about that.So It took me a bit of trial and error to find out how I even start the game as my set keys did nothing.For anyone struggling:Movement: Arrow keysInteract: Z-keyMode change from ""look at"" to ""interact"" ect: hold ""left shift"" + press ""arrow key"" that points in the direction you want to selectAppart from that  I would totally recommend this game. Great fun if you play it together with a friend in ""couch coop"" ^^"
,Recommended,453290,32979677,Posted: 29 June,all,AuZiE,"Finished it. The controls were confusing at first. Looks like the Enter key for this game is the ""Z"" key. As for the game, I quite enjoyed it, took me a lot of thinking on the puzzles. I only surrendered on the locked box in room 3. When I read the guide for it, it was actually not possible for a normal person to have come up with the solution, trust me.Will I recommend it? Sure, the game's cheap anyway, and you wont regret the ride."

,Recommended,453290,33068668,Posted: 30 June,all,EternityIsNow,"tl;drIt's often frustrating, with solutions that (even after consulting a guide) you won't really understand. But if you hold out through those rare, annoying moments, it's a great game worth your time (around 80 minutes) and your money. If for no other reasons than the art looks pretty cute, and the ""awareness"" concept in the summary doesn't disappoint, I recommend picking it up.-----------------The Long VersionPart of the charm of this game is it's ""awareness"" concept. Not only do you slowly figure out what the items are (which doesn't disappoint), but the game increases it's detail (rugs get patterns, paintings change, etc) as your percentage goes up, as well. What also helps is certain items are moveable, but since you don't know what they are, you assume they're needed--that's not always the case. These distractions really help lengthen the experience of this (pretty short) game.The puzzles range from ""that was obvious...."" to ""...and how was I supposed to know to do that?""What adds to this is often the frustration of the awareness. As your character doesn't know what certain items are, you really can't do much of anything until you level it up to 50% by examining items around the room(s). In the first level, this doesn't take long. After the first 2 levels, it starts to take a few minutes of ""inspect... interact... next item... and repeat..."" just to figure out that huge box is, in fact, a chair.The final level truly is what will test your patience in this game. The puzzles seem really disconnected, with the only connecting factor being that it's pretty self-explanatory that you're not finishing the game without completing all four of themas indicated by the FOUR COLORED LANTERNS AND A FORBODING TABLE IN AN OTHERWISE DARK AND EMPTY ROOM.To be frankly honest, I still don't know how I was supposed to know the answer to one of them. Thankfully, this is no longer the 1990's, and there exists a guide on almost every game, with this being no exceptionthough the one ""complete"" guide that does exist on this game does a great job of sayingwhatto do, it doesn't sayhow you were supposed to knowto do it, often leaving me confused.In the end, asking this price for an ~80 minute experience is subjective. Around the length of a short movie for $5 USD seems more than fair to me. I don't regret it, and I'll definitely be recommending it to others."
,Recommended,453290,34072411,Posted: 6 August,all,TenOfClubs,"Sure, in the screen caps it looks simple, but if you like room escape games, Awareness Rooms will provide a lovely little diversion. The ""touching/using everything until it comes into better focus"" mechanic is fun/interesting, the environments are well realized and not difficult to navigate, and the main character is cute. :3 The script (what little is there) makes sense and has been well edited - thank you in particular to the person who managed this for the dev, or to the dev for spending time on this. I still had trouble with some of the later puzzles, but it was not because any clues or flavor text were vague, poorly written, or confusing. As with many Room Escape games, there isn't much in the way of plot, but If you've spent any time with <spoiler>Bloodborne and/or Yume Nikki</spoiler>, it is hard not to draw certain... conclusions.My only issue with it is that there isn't more of it. I say this both because I would love it if the dev put out more (please!) and because it's potentially a bit expensive (your value depends on how good you are with puzzle/room escape games and how quickly you go looking for walkthroughs - resist the urge! You can do it!) compared to what you can find online in a similar vein. This is one of those little indie projects that is absolutely worth taking a risk on, and when on sale there's no reason not to. We hear a lot about Steam games whose existence is questionable at best, and this isn't one of them! Enjoy!"
