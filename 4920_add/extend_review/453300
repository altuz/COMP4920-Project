Lord knows it's a thankless job, necessary in any successful party yet never the hero always the scapegoat should things go wrong and you're unable to keep your tank from dying as he charges face first into the nearest swarm of enemies. Why any sane and rational person would do it, much less enjoy it, is one of gaming's great mysteries and yet here we are. The few, the proud, the possibly stupid, the career white mages, medics, clerics, and priests. I've always liked being the healing classes in mmorpgs and class based shooters, so A Healer Only Lives Twice instantly caught my eye upon being released. Rather than being the knight as in virtually every other video game created, you play as his stalwart support, and it is through your careful spell management and item use that the hero survives and the game progresses.A fairly straightforward game of fighting monsters and progressing forward through levels, AHOLT never the less manages to feel engrossing with a sense of urgency laying thick upon you as your Knight's limbs slowly get torn apart by wave after wave of your standard slimes, bats, and tree monsters, Managing your MP along with your Knight's health in tandem was exciting to me, being better equipped to keep him alive as I unlocked skill after skill remained a satisfying experience. Despite there being ideal, near required strategies to progress through the floors, the real excitement and individual play comes in the leveling and use of your healing magics. Quick thinking is required to keep your friend alive and it is through this rapid paced game play that AHOT remains fresh and fun.I would definitely recommend trying the Trial mode a time or two to get used to the game play, item management, and controls as the game does lack a proper tutorial and therefore can become bewildering upon first starting, but once you get the hang of things AHOLT is a charming take on the classic dungeon crawler that forces you to embrace and appreciate the challenges of being a Healer and possibly treat your raid party's white mage with a bit more TLC the next time you boot up your favorite anime rpg.All in all, the best thing about this game is it gives me a chance to play my favorite archetype in games without being yelled at for not sacrificing my life for some twerp with a God Complex over a X Box microphone and boy is that nice.It's rough out here for a Healer, it's about time we got to shine a bit."

It is possible to beat it with no upgrades, on your very first run (though unlikely, only because you won't know what you're doing).  Playing with no upgrades is one of the modes (which I just beat before writing this).  It's a great little challenging game of balancing multiple things, once you understand the mechanics.At first, the upgrade system gives that impression that you need to do the same thing over and over and get upgrades.  This is the mistake many negative reviewers are making.  I thought the same thing, and was disappointed after the first few run throughs.  But then I started listening to what my knight was saying.  There are some unintuitive mechanics to understand, and your partner is giving you hints."

Make no mistake, this is a five dollar game with about five dollars worth of gameplay here. While some games at that price have managed to entertain me for hundreds of hours, this one is quite easily beaten, and once that is done, there isn't much else to do other than max out all of your perks, if that's your thing. You can also run Trial mode and simply try to see how far you can get through a randomly generated stream of foes without dying.But otherwise, it's a very fun experiment in healer-centric game play, and plays more like a puzzle/strategy, than an actual RPG. There ARE stat increases, but it's a small part of your overall success. Most of the game play lies in knowing when to use which skils, such as using the skill that sacrifices one of your tank's limb HP for Mana then turning that into XP bonus or a much needed limb recovery spell. It's fun, and very engaging. There's a lot of quick decisions to be made. I particularly enjoy the meta game play of sacrificing Mana to get your XP modifier as high as possible while still effectively supporting your tank.My only issues (other than length, which is a small nitpick) is that, at least for me, two of your eight total skills were somewhat underpowered or simply uncessecary, which sort of takes away some of the strategy. Though that may come down to the way you play. Others might find more use for the barrier and double attack spells, I hardly ever found any need for them.Balance issues aside, it's a wonderful little game with nice music, and I hope to see more games from this developer, because they seem to have some unique ideas amongst them."
,Recommended,453300,26483341,"Posted: 7 November, 2016",all,Demicol,"This game is purely about resource management.I decided to write a very indepth review so you know if this game is for you.You play as the titular healer and your task is to keep your Knight alive as you make your way out of a dungeon.The combat/game is entirely in real time and your Knight has 5 body parts that you need to keep topped off. Enemies will telegraph with a speech bubble where they will hit.You start with a basic heal spell and a way to craft various potions and other useful things. As you kill enemies you get levels and can learn new spells or upgrade an existing one. The game does not pause as this is happening.Once you die you get some points that you can spend on upgrades that carry over from game to game so you can last longer.Note that the game is actually very fast paced, despite what it may sound like.You must:1)Manage your mana that you use to cast spells. The game has a day/night cycle and during the Night you have mana regen. How much, depends on how full the moon is which is displayed on the screen. Can you last till its night if you cast a buff or should you save it for heals?2)Manage your crafting materials. You can only hold 5 of a single incredient, do you make a potion now so you can pick up more or wait untill you get others so you can make something more powerful?3)Manage your Knights HP. Probably self explanatory. If one of his body parts ""dies"" he gets pottentially a massive disadvantage.4)Manage your torches. You have a limited amount of time to spend in the dungeon as indicated by your torch counter. The torch burns down slowly over time and once all your torches run out you die. Each encounter will drop at least 1 torch for you, but you must kill the enemies fast and efficient to break even.5)Manage your items. You can craft or find various items. You can either use them as intended or burn them to extend your torch's life time. Do you REALLY need that potion? You can hold a maxium of 5 items, so it doesn't get too cluttered at any point.6)Manage what your knight is killing. You must switch targets manually to choose what he attacks. He WILL attack an empty space if you're not paying attention. Some enemies can do stuff like make it rain so your torch will drain faster and the rain wont stop till you kill them, so you must prioritize.7)Manage/choose when to use the red ball. All encounters will also drop 1 red ball. If you USE the red ball, you will kill all remaining enemies in the encounter but they will NOT give you EXP or items. If you're running out of torch time it may be wise to grab the next one, cut your losses and kill everything to save its burn time. The ball will vanish from your inventory after all enemies are dead, so you can't save it. You must pick up a new one in the next encounter and it may be a while before it appears.The gameplay loop is roughly:4 lines of enemies appear, you help your Knight kill them by healing/buffing him. Then your duo advances automatically to the next encounter. You aim to do this as efficiently as possible to keep your torch burning. Then you die and get points depending how far you made it, use them on upgrades and start over.I would recommend this game, if any of the above sound appealing."
,Recommended,453300,23477213,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,Mettool,"A splendid little strategy/puzzle hybrid in which you're a healer tasked with healing a knight as he battles through a dungeon. You buff him, heal him, and keep him alive as long as you possibly can. While this sounds like some sort of MMO Healing Simulator on paper, you'll find that this game isn't at all simply a concept plucked from World of Warcraft and ends up containing a surprising amount of depth in its systems. You control the healer's resource management while deciding which targets the knight should eliminate first in semi turn-based combat. It's a lot of fun, and very addicting.A lot of the game isn't explained to you, and is designed to be tackled multiple times as you learn and hope to get further into the dungeon with each attempt. While it comes off as very obtuse at first, the game presents a fair learning curve that you'll figure out by the third or fourth run.The only downsides I've found are a lack of polish in the some areas. None of the music loops properly, and the transition between waves is a bit too long, even on fast-forward. The RNG on wave formations might screw you over too, so be prepared for a few frustrating moments. But if you can look past those sorts of things, there's a good time to be found here."
,Not Recommended,453300,33384795,Posted: 8 July,all,Zephyr,"This game has very little replayability. You're forced to play through the same sequence over and over again with very little variety whilst you very slowly upgrade your abilities just so you can very slightly delay that inevitable ""quest failed"" screen.The reason I'm stressing this is because it's just as grindy and unrewarding as it sounds.That being said this can can maybe used as a timewaster if you're in between queues to some other game, otherwise I'd say it's far more suited to be a mobile ""cash vampire"" game."
,Recommended,453300,31187409,Posted: 16 April,all,NaviKing,"My playtime of 5.9 hours represents a 100% completion of the game. It is very short. However, for $4.99 it is well worth it (and I got it on sale at some point).This is a roguelike game in which you play as a healer, protecting your knight and clearing wave after wave of monsters in a dungeon. You have basically 4 responsibilities1. Heal/protect the individual limbs of your knight, as well as use your spells to enhance his offensive capabilities.2. Select targets for your knight to attack.3. Cast your EXP spell as often as possible to keep yourself and your knight gaining levels at a steady pace (and manage your ability points as you level up)4. Craft items to compensate for anything you can't manage.The basic strategy is to pick up the torch on every level as well as the Red Stone, which allows you to instantly clear a level. When you fail (and you will probably fail) you can use the points you earn to upgrade your healer's spells, the rate at which your knight earns exp, and the drop rate of materials.It is a very simple game with serviceable graphics, but still quite fun. If you like rougelike games and just want to pick up a game to kill maybe 5-15 minutes per play (late game), then I would definitely recommend this game even at the full price of $4.99. If you like games with a story, I would pass on this one as there is no story to speak of. Still, if you can pick it up on sale for $3-4, I'd say you should give it a try anyway."

It's actually a resource and time management game, you have a skill that increase the exp you gain from fights, so most of the time you'll want to cast it. As with any good healer know, the trick is to keep the tank alive just barely and not overheal, so you can use your mana for other things.Most of the time you'll be defeated not because your tank is defeated, but because you run out of time. You're timed by your torch. If you're lucky you can get extra torch from enemy, there's always one per wave. You can also burn your items to get more torch time. ""Do I really need this bandage or should I just burn it for torch time?"" There's also red orb that drop once per wave that will end the encounter, but if you use it you won't get anymore xp or item. ""Do I use the red orb now or should I wait until I get extra torch/farm for xp""? You also need to direct the tank on where to attack, whether to attack enemy that summon rain to extinguish your torch, enemy that buff other enemies, or enemies that are just plain strong.You get upgrade points even if you lose, to make your next runs easier and easier.In sum, the game's pretty simple but it's pretty nice. And it's not that expensive either."
76561198080789462,Recommended,453300,23394477,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,Tchai,"This is an interesting game.  Certainly worth the price point.You play as a healer, trying to keep a warrior alive so you can both get out of a dungeon, and so must fight waves of enemies to get to the end.  The gameplay mainly consists of using the right ability in the right circumstance; should you put a wall up so a limb won't die from that next attack, or just heal? Should you bump up the damage of the warriors next attack?  Do you have enough mana stored to use your increase exp ability, so you can level faster and get stronger abilities?Most importantly though is understanding the torch and red orb mechanics.  There are two ways to die in the dungeon; either all the limbs of the warrior are critically injured, or you run out of torches.  You ""can"" replenish the torch with items, though I haven't ever had enough to actually use that ability; the main source of torches are from the waves themself.  Each wave has one torch and one red orb.  You want to find these as soon as possible, and then comes decision time: do you use the orb as soon as you have it, or kill some more of the wave to get more exp?  Every wave you complete (whether by killing the whole wave or by using the orb to clear it) will decrease your increased exp modifier by 50%, so clearing a wave is an important decision.  You have to balance your level growth, your mana and the warriors health, and your time.Different mobs have different annoying abilities, but I'll leave you to find those for yourself.  Discovery!You are not meant to win the game in the first run, just get as far as possible.  You gain currency (PP) to spend on the upgrade page on the menu depending on how far you got, and what level you got to, which can be spent on a variety of upgrades (increasing the potency of an xp buff you can cast, gaining more reagents, increasing the level cap of abilities, xp buffs contingent on particular contidions, being able to start later in the dungeon, etc).  You can reset your profile to try and get to the end with less buffs from the options menu.For a cute little $5 game, I certainly got more fun out of it than I thought I would.  Plus, always good to show people that playing support roles isn't as easy as they might think it is!"

After 3½ hours of gametime not once have I lost due to damage or healing but always due to running out of torches.This game is a rogue-light were you delve into a dungeon with your knight companion. The knight will automatically attack 1 creature each turn (you decide which one) and your job is to heal him. Well, in theory. In practise only a tiny fraction of the gameplay is actually healing. The game has a torch-system, a constant timer that ticks down and when you run out of torches you lose. Most of your time will actually be spent crafting potions, using items, buffing your EXP and doing everything in your power to find Torches. After every fail, aka running out of torches, you receive points based on your performance which you can then spend on upgrades, restarting with a bit more buffs than you did the last time.Overall I was expecting a game focused on healing and what I got was a game focused on torches. Not once have I encountered challenge in healing or managing damage income during the time I have played. It's an alright game if grabbed at high discount that heavily suffers from an unfortunate timer system."

Cool resource management (not only mana and health of knights' limbs, but also item crafting for potions and upgrades, xp, managing when to use torches/orbs and when to keep fighting, day/night cycle, oh so many little things!) that stays complex enough to be interesting but doesn't get actually really hard nor frustrating. It's a short (casual) little game, I've now played it under 2 hours and gotten to the last boss the last run (didn't kill it yet though), but I still recommend it for its nice and rare healer centric gameplay.

And you realise very quiockly that this knight would be an all-powerful corpse if not for his little healer friend. The game has quite a few charms to it and although it is a little confusing at first it is very satisfying to push your knight through waves of monsters using not only healing spells, but also spells to buff his attack or defence, and change his skills in battle.I'm doing a series for this game which will at least be 5-6 episodes, probably more if there is eough content to keep playing. I really enjoy the game which makes it easy to record. The link to episde 1 is below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOUM1qCTOgUThings I liked about the game:-Discecting the body into multiple parts that each require attention to keep functioning.-Spells that each feel unique and help in different situations or play styles.-The infinite loop of the game is done very well which keeps going back into the dungeon fun.-The upgrade system both in each run and carrying through all runs is pretty diverse with many stats to improve. \-***The Fast-Forward Botton*** This makes going back into the dungeon ease, as you don't have to waste as much time grinding through early levels.-Pretty fast paced.-The music is simple, but pleasant to listen to each time the dungeon is revisited.Things that could be improved-A better tutuorial / explination of how to play the game.-A better description of what stats do for the knight and healer.-keyboard integration? using num-pad or hotkeys for spells would be nice."

As a healer your job is to buff, shield and (obviously) heal your party, this game covers all those aspects and also manages to make you 'panic' or 'stress' as all healers in games do.  Early levels we're a bit dull but over time enemies get tougher, stressing the fact that you need to manage all your resources - mana, crafting ingredients and cooldowns - very carefully or else.  Only criticism is the torches, burning fuel does almot nothing to increase torch time and most of the time torches are at the very back of the tier so if you focus on the wrong column you're pretty much dead by the next wave... A seperate mode with infinite torches would be nice.tl;dr - It was a very nice game; torches limit the experience though."

This game is extremely fun, and well worth the $5.My main gripe with the game is how unexpectedly short it ended up being. After dying on wave 4, then 6, then 4 again, I figured out the maintorch -> red stonemechanic and didnt have a problem beating the game on that same run. After finishing it (with 90 mins of total playtime), I was disappointed to see that there is no ""hard mode"" (besides playing without upgrades, which isnt that hard).That being said, I got my $5 out of it and wouldn't mind coming back to this game if they added a ""new game+"" difficulty, or another mode or something.

It's well-implemented in terms of resource management and intuitive to learn, if a bit simplistic. There are two issues that may detract from this. First, certain strategies are absolutely better than other strategies (not many, specifically the necessity of getting the torch then using the red orb to wipe the tier as opposed to clearing the wave). However, there's a great deal of flexibility in leveling skills, and some of the fun is finding which skills suit you best or work in different scenarios (I haven't done much testing to see if some skills are absolutely better than others, but if they are, it isn't as noticeable as the torch-orb strategy). Second, replayability is somewhat limited. There are three modes and a time-based score system, but the modes are very similar, and the score system isn't as effective as others I've seen (i.e. making the player want to get a higher score, though I'm not someone who usually pursues a higher score, so if you are, it might be better). That said, you'll absolutely get a few hours out of it. Considering the price, that's reasonable."

You also get to choose which mob the knight is attacking with lb and rb which I didn't notice at first.

However, it doesn't work with a touchscreen or with a touchpad mouse.  I hope they'll fix this in the future.  Nothing against the game, but it wasn't what I was looking for."

Its not too difficult tho, easy to pick up and play. Got limited depth and 2 game modes, would yet have to finish the EX Mode myself. Quick game for a good price."
,Not Recommended,453300,35499073,Posted: 5 October,all,Quaggy,"This game is unplayable for me. If you, like many/most humans, have difficulty reading white text on a dark background (which Steam is sadly infested with... but you can circumvent Steam's gosh-aweful graphic design by installing the Air Theme), then this game isn't for you. Practically all the text is white on a black background, making the game virtually unplayable (unless you like getting migraines). Furthermore, it defaults to Japanese, rather than English. So, it might be a good game or it might not, but since I can't read the text, it gets to live in my folder of unplayable games with Undertale and Rise to Ruins."
