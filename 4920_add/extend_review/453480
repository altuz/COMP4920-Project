I've now played enough of the game to see that the balance is very heavily skewed toward high-end-combo play. Most games between competitive decks are just a race to see who can get the big legendary combo off first, or to see if you can play your combo before the other guy draws the counter. All other turns are rendered trivial, so in a lot of cases it just boils down to a coin toss.I'm not going to take back my positive review because I really do admire the foundation. And I recognize that other people do like this style of gameplay; it's just not for me. So while I'm going to uninstall it after saving this revised review, I still think it's worth a try for those who like CCGs. It's free, after all, and they are pretty generous with the cards, even though you'll never get enough free cards to be competitive."

I used to love this game, but with the Rise of Bahamut patch the competitive aspect of this game went down the gutter.RNG/Rock-Paper-Scissors:The game has become an RNG fest: extreme machtup based deck winrates up to 61,9+%, also winrates for the same deck that differ around 12,2+% based on whether you go first or second (Source:https://shadowverse.gamepress.gg/meta-deck-analytics-january-23-29- set filter to Master rank). More than that - an infestation of hyper-snowballing decks like daria and cancerous  insta-win cards like Seraph (draw Odin in time or lose the game) or Dimension Shift(: 1 player with 4-turns in a row ""interactive and fun"").A meta consisting of Aggro, OTK-Combo/Control and hyper-snowballing (Daria).Small EDIT: Some new numbers arrived - we're seeing matchup based winrates up to 78,3% when going 2nd. (Source:http://shadowlog.com/trend/2017/4/4/55Aggro-Daria vs Swordcraft(class average!)).As somebody who achieved the highest rank in Shadowverse I just can't recommand the game (post Rise of Bahamut) anymore. RNG might not be as obvious as in Hearthstone, but Rock-Paper-Scissor-matchmatcking determines a vast majority of games.I used to love Shadowverse, but with skill becoming less and less of a factor, I - as well as other top rank players - are personally losing the fun in this game.Don't trust me?

The gameplay was fun, they showered me with free packs, and I was really getting into it. The graphics and sounds are quite lovely for a CCG, making each card feel especially powerful or wimpy as appropriate.At first the card balance felt spot on. I had a good bit of fun playing decks of my own design not even resorting to net decks (decks that are competitive and posted online). Early game cards didn't feel as though they just rocked the game, and end game cards felt sufficiently powerful to merit having them.Then as I moved up in experience and power, I started engaging more experienced players, I ran into the same issue I have in most other online CCGs. The net decks start taking over. People with multiple copies of especially powerful mid to late game cards become more abundant. The freedom to experience the card game, to experiment with the cards, and to make a deck which feels as though it was truly mine diminished greatly. With recent expansions they even added extremely obnoxious and powerful end game cards which can be seen in almost every deck you play against. They are truly so powerful that not using them puts you at a significant disadvantage, and you must always be prepared to counter them, especially if you don't have them yourself.As a passing Hearthstone player, I took up this game based on word of mouth hoping that it could scratch the CCG itch that Hearthstone was seriously lacking as of late, a similar CCG with stagnant gameplay.The new player experience is awesome. I can't deny that I had fun playing this game initially; However, down the road, bear in mind that the players who play to win will overwhelm experimental gameplay, and how well you're doing as a new player won't reflect on your performance once you start encountering said players. Sadly, my joy for this game has passed.If you are a player who enjoys experimenting with cards with a reasonable degree of success, I wouldn't recommend this game. But, if you don't mind taking the time and effort to acquire said extremely powerful cards to get an edge on people who don't have them, then feel free to give it a try. Such is the nature of CCGs, and I personally don't even know why I even bother trying them anymore.For players of my expectations, this game is not recommended."

,Recommended,453480,30005515,Posted: 18 February,all,Potor10,"Quite enjoyable aesthetically pleasing game that I put a decent amount of free time into.Art 8/10 - Enjoy the anime type art style, but due to the large amount of artists art can be very stratified and different. I personally don't mind the revealing art whatsoever, but be warned. This game most likely isn't for children 13 and under.Gameplay 9/10 - Generally follows 3 main ideas similar to another card game Hearthstone. You want to control your card advantage, board presence, and tempo. By itself the game would be pretty mediocre (one of the reasons why I quit HS), but Shadowverse introduces the evolve mechanic. Evolving creatures generally boosts stats and lets them instantly attack into another creature. I personally love the huge tempo swings experienced from evolves and that keeps me invested into the game.Developers 9/10 - Some games often dump progression into a strict meta (Such as HS pushing the aggro meta). Despite the undesirable and often unfair games, the problem isn't the meta, its the developers' responsiveness to the desires of the community. I personally feel that the developers of Shadowverse (actual players of other card games) understand what is happening to the ladder and are making a step which will benefit the most. One thing we don't need is sudden, rash decisions in designing such a large game. Shadowverses' developers have not gone to balance too many cards yet so that aspect is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that Shadowverses' developers are one of the most F2P friendly card game developers. They often give out free packs making it super easy to F2P, something I will capitalize next.Free To Play-ability 10/10 -  Starting the game gets you 30-40 packs for free, which can almost always provide you with enough vials to craft a competitive deck for ladder. Free packs from promotions and tons of quick rewards only speed up the growth of your collection. As of now, Shadowverse is the most f2p friendly card game (Out of HearthStone and Magic [Haven't tried Evoker yet]).Is there any pay to win BS?Shadowverse also offers the sale of crystals, which can be used to purchase more packs and pre-built decks. Despite the initial view that spending money leads to a greater advantage, skill and knowledge often play a greater factor in determining the outcome of games than solid card quality. Therefore I would say this game is almost completely free of pay-to-win because you can still lose running a deck with terrible card quality but if you have a decently competitive deck a lot of the games come down to skill.Edit: With the new expansions coming out and releasing cards on a new level of power, I would have to modify my original statement. Card quality does matter now.Is it worth it for a new player to spend money?Shadowverse is excellent for new players as they offer the magic of pre-built decks. Pre-built decks are great because they offer a solid selection of cards and guarantee necessary legendaries for a craft. They cost 500 crystals for the first purchase (increasing to 750 for ever subsequent purchase), which is literally only 5$ during a crystal sale. I feel like they carry their value as they bring in critical legendaries (which of course can be crafted if you don't have spare change) while introducing how crafts should be played. Currently, the most valuable pre-builts are the Bloodcraft prebuilt (control blood), Forestcraft prebuilt (almost every forestcraft deck uses cards from this pre-built), and Shadowcraft prebuilt.I would definitely rate Shadowverse a solid 9/10 overall due to its defining characteristics, solid gameplay, and f2p aspects. I hope you have the same enjoyment I did while playing this game, and don't be too competitive while playing. After all, its a card game."

76561198060932732,Not Recommended,453480,29584272,Posted: 30 January,all,myhr2,"Edit : as of now, Cygames seems to encourage fast games with many powerfull combos and finishers that can easily remove half of your health in one turn. While it's fun and all when you're the one accomplishing it, it feels really uninteractive when you're on the recieving end. Still, the devs are really generous with free packs. Does it make up for the repetitive and uninteractive gameplay? YMMV.If you know Hearthstone, the digital collectible card game by Blizzard, then it's simple : while being fundamentally a japanese copy of Hearthstone, Shadowverse improves the formula in many quite important ways : more complex, less reliant on RNG, more generous in F2P content, and less greedy for the paid-content. However, in the competitive end of the game, you'll run into the same ""problems"" with a specific metagame and over-represented decks that tend towards short ""aggro"" games (but less aggravating than in Hearthstone).If you don't, then let me elaborate a little : Shadowverse is a digital Collectible Card Game. CCG are a peculiar kind of games. They not only function as games, with rules, goals, a winner and a looser, but also as collection, where the goal is to ""collect them all"". As such, before considering investing time, and maybe money, into said game, you should be perfectly aware of one thing : collectible games are expensive. They're designed to make you pay to complete a collection, and what you pay is the feeling to make progress in that collection.Not that it's impossible to play as a F2P! In fact, Shadowverse, in comparison to other CGG, is quite generous with its free content, and you can reasonnably expect to open roughly three free packs every two days. In comparison, Hearthstone is more like three packs in four days.Imo, the best way to handle this kind of game is to manage your expectations : what is your goal?- complete the collection? This game is kinda cheap for the collection aspect, investing roughly 90 dollars every three months should be enough to get one exemplary of each card (and yes, this is cheap...for this kind of game)- be competitive? Because you get quite a lot of free stuff, you can reasonably make a free competitive deck by destroying all your useless cards and crafting the ones you will use.- have fun by making weird decks? Shadowverse offer a ""random"" mode with rewards, Take two, which is quite cool and balanced.Just note that doing everything at once will be really difficult.That being said, Shadowverse is probably your best bet, because of how beginner-friendly it is. Good luck!"
76561198041765678,Recommended,453480,29621391,Posted: 31 January,all,DedVoid,"Shadowverse, for awhile seemed like an optimal replacement for Hearthstone or just a nice card game for newcomers.POSITIVES:The game is a refreshing card game that you'll likely enjoy if you've enjoyed games like Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering. There are many different ways to build decks and the classes are pretty diverse in how they play.Getting wins early on with a custom deck feels very rewarding, and the game can be very addictive!I also need to give the game props for being quite generous! The game gives you 45 packs if I recall correctly to start out, which is pretty dang good. That combined with the fact that you earn gold just via logging in and completing single player and what not is pretty nice. It would be nice if you could earn gold just by playing and/or winning games without having to adhere to the daily missions.So, Shadowverse is certainly a great game. However, if you don't have someone to play with like me, you'll find that the more you play, the more the game falls into the same pitfalls as Hearthstone unfortunately. Which caused me to gradually lose interest.With that said...NEGATIVES:Shadowverse certainly does have a lot of neat strategies and deck types, but it suffers from a similar problem of the developers not balancing cards that are clearly way too good.(The higher you make it ranked play, the more you'll see less variety and the more you'll see the same decks. The biggies I see the most often are that are pretty infamous: Runecraft Daria and Bloodcraft Aggro)Some specifics that you may want to skip: There are cards that have mathematical objective improvements and I can't fathom how the cards were designed and considered to be okay (if you get high in ranked not playing Runecraft, you'll learn to hate one card: Daria, as virtually every runecraft deck is built around that card or dimensional shift). Aggro decks sometimes are impossible to win against due to the nature of essentially needing to draw certain cards quickly to deal with the insane damage output, you can lose as soon as turn 5 against an aggro deck.It's funny in a way, because the Bloodcraft classes's mechanic is that certain Bloodcraft cards will have unique effects if your hero is below 10 defense (which is health). However, aggro is so insanely effective and quick that you'll never see bloodcraft decks that actually utilize that mechanic.(There are of course, other decks you'll encounter in your ranked adventures, Havencraft control, Swordcraft aggro, shadowcraft control/aggro. There's certainly more variety than I encountered in Heathstone, so that's to be noted.)So, most of my complaints with the game are similar to my complaints to Hearthstone: Aggro is very effective and not very skill-based (in most cases, mostly Bloodcraft) to play well and win quickly. And there's some cards that very clearly need fine-tuning but never get altered.The game provided me fair amount of hours of entertainment, and I'd probably have more fun if I had a friend (single tear) to play gimmick decks with as even in unranked I mostly encounter meta decks. I should note I'm A3 rank, I'm fairly ""experienced"" so I'd like to think I'm somewhat knowledgeable, but I'm no pro by any means!]Couple things to add, there's a ""Take Two"" mode which is equivilent to the arena mode in Hearthstone, so there's also that. And there's a short campaign for each class with a neat lil story, also nice!CONCLUSION (finally):The game is good. It's just a shame because the problems it suffers from could be be lessened greatly by some simple fine-tuning I would think. BUT if you have someone to battle against that's a big bonus, and the game still has a great deal to offer so I do still reccomend it."

THIS is because cygames want shadowverse to be a quniue game than heartstone to be a short battle that usually decides who win and who loses by the end of turn 10 (usually). just remeber that is the game shadowverse it's unique and how they balance decks is that they will buff/nerf cards. that is all.cons:-it's a new game which means there'll be buggs everywhere, but the devs are REALLY REALLY concerned about that and they try to fix it ASAP, the amount of downloads of SV is already 9 million in less than a year. imagine in 3 years at this rate it'll be 30 million (jokes)-the storyline: just a bit of character developement (idk) however i like the rewards that they give and unique boss battles at the end of every chapter :Pconclusion:-what i wished Shadowverse can implement: SV a game being very similar to HS can have really straightforward gameplay. Somes i wonder if devs can impliment things like tag team battles, where it isn't 1v1 anymore but can rather have a 2v2 pvp, because this way SV wouldn't be able to have massive winstreaks using a tier S meta deck (which is happening right now atm) just like in league of legends. so the more gameplay machanics ther better? that's what i think.. to me at least... and SV would be more fun than it is now!"

76561198125352706,Not Recommended,453480,29769985,Posted: 7 February,all,Ryuusaiga,"Initially, this game was great. It felt like a perfect mix of balance, lack of RNG, and fair progression, but somewhere along the lines it quickly did a 360. For those of you coming from Hearthstone seeking something new, I will start by saying that even at its worse this game is better than Hearthstone, but don't expect to be impressed after you've spent some time getting familiar with it. If you are looking for a CCG with balance, a minimal amount of RNG that has no overbearing effect on gameplay, and a decent amount of progression within reasonable time as mentioned above, Shadowverse fails to deliver.Balance/Meta:Contrary to first impressions, the imbalance within Shadowverse derive from many reasons, with one reason being its blatantly overpowered legendary cards. The meta boasts cards such as Seraph (a card that if not answered using a specific spell within a certain amount of turns automatically wins its user the game), Prince of Darkness/a.k.a Satan (a card that guarantees victory, assuming the user is not near death, by replacing the users hand with blatantly broken spells and minions), Daria ( a card that promotes reckless play by not only giving its user a whole new hand full of cards when needed, but also significantly lowering the cost of the cards aquired. Daria can also have her cost reduced, which makes it easier to play her on an early turn), and much more. Another reason are the types of decks that are standard to the meta. The main four types of decks you will come across (unless you are in the beginner ranks) are braindead agrro face decks, control decks that aim to stall the game until they can drop a game winning legendary, one turn kill cheese decks, and snowball decks aiming to constantly flood the board with minions until you finally run out of answers. I've recently made it to B0, and although not a super high rank, I have only come into contact with those four types of decks for majority of my time playing this game. It's gotten so repetitive and nervre wrecking that I hesitate to start the game now. If all of what I have said sounds bad so far, don't even get me started on the RNG. If you draw a bad hand and don't get anything playable pass turn 3, you may as well surrender. It gets even worse if you draw bad AND get matched up against a face aggro deck. You have to sit there with your thumb in your mouth while being whacked in the face as you watch them flood the board on perfect curve.Progression:Not much to say here except for it's infinitely better than the amount of time it takes to progress in Hearthstone. Where the progression falls short within Shadowverse is that you usually need multiple amounts of different lengendary and gold cards within the same deck to make it viable. It can be quite expensive is terms of vials (similar to dust in Hearthstone). The way to get around this is by usually making a cheap face aggro deck, but this is a horrible option for anyone who doesn't like to spend all of their game time mindlessly rushing face.Summary:In general, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone looking to play it competitively and advance in rank. This is the type of game that would best be played logging in to complete daily missions, maybe having a couple of unranked games, and then logging out. If you still wish to play it competitively, just be prepared to be met with a wall of cancerous decks (which you will be eventually forced to play as well if you ever plan on standing a chance) and games completely depending on RNG as you move through the ranks.Although it has no pc version in the US, a game I would recommend sticking to is Mabinogi Duel. You'd most likely have a better time with that than both Shadowverse and Hearthstone. It does everything better while offering a more intriguing storyline and cards."

76561198001634768,Recommended,453480,29669699,Posted: 3 February,all,#TanyaDidNothingWrong,"This CCG has its own cancer deck(s) of course, but it's still good enough to recommend, since my experience is: a tiny bit of frustration, which quickly goes away, and a whole bunch of fun, that you won't forget any time soon. Most of the following is very subjective, so that's an other reason to try the game, but of course reading different opinions might help you decide if the game is for you, so here we go! (I'll try to stay objective, where I can. Tl;dr: check the ""OVERVIEW"" part.)THE LOOKS:The animations on the cards in a lot of cases look great, even if the mostly anime style drawings are not to your liking. And even if they're not to your liking, they are mostly very well drawn. A lot of the cards are drawn in this style, but definitely not all: some of them give a ""classic"" fantasy vibe, so they're just pleasant to look at. The overall look of the game however can be a little bit confusing/too much at first. There can be a lot of effects on the screen at the same time, which can make the game look less appealing.THE SOUNDS:I've seen some people complain about the voice acting. While it's not the greatest, it's definitely not that bad, and I don't even think it even has to be great. This is a free card game after all, and for its ""price"", it delivers. I've seen (and heard) a LOT of very bad voice acting in games and movies too, and if you're experienced, you can clearly see the effort they put in the voices. The music is not horrible either, but it IS made of few minutes long loops, so if you don't like that... well, you're gonna listen to your own music anyway after a while, so in this case you'll just start sooner. Not that they're bad loops though. On the other hand one thing I really like is the voice acting of the cards (that speak). In most cases they're consistent with the creatures' personalities, sometimes even if it changes when you evolve them (Lucifer). I also love that you can make emotes clip into each other, but again, some do not like that you can spam 3 emotes/turn. I agree however, that there could be more emotes, as sometimes I feel I can't react to the opponent's emotes appropriately.GAMEPLAY:You can decide on your own, if you like the voice acting and the look of the cards (or rather, their ""anime style"" drawing). But don't judge it only by its looks! The game itself has some pretty good and unique mechanics, so even if the look of the game is not your favorite, it is still possible to have fun thanks to the variety of these mechanics, and the comebacks that seem to happen quite often, especially in lower ranks.There are a bunch of unique features too, like Private Play Take Two (which means that you can play arena with a friend for free). But you are constantly reminded, that not everyone has the same idea of ""fun"" as you do. There ARE cancerous decks with cancerous ""combos"" - the most recent being the Daria Runecraft deck. At lower (than Master) ranks at least half of the games I've played were against aggro decks, though it IS possible to win against them with a good enough control deck. Of course if you'd like to depend only on the free packs you receive, there's a chance you won't have all the necessary cards, so making an aggro deck in most cases will be much easier. This, however won't be as fun imo, as playing a control/midrange or a less easy combo deck.OVERVIEW:I think this game you'll just have to see for yourself. There's one very important thing to keep in mind though: you're here to have FUN. Yes, there are less balanced cards, yes, there are copy-paste netdecks. But overall the game delivers. I really enjoy most of the matches, and when I meet said netdecks, I still have fun. How? I guess I just know that this is a game. If you only care about ranking, just copy a deck and off you go, but if you care about the adventure the possibilities have to offer, try different combinations of different cards!BUT! Before you make an okay deck, and start to rank up like crazy, remember: the game becomes MUCH harder, after you reach rank C/B (depending on your deck). In lower ranks it is easier to complete your daily quests. If you want to stay in lower ranks until you have a decent enough deck, then it's a great opportunity to try ""worse"" decks. Let the experiments begin! In this way you'll gain experience (literally and in-game) which will be very useful, if you'd like to know   your opponents AND the possible combos you can pull off with your cards that you've never used before.All in all Shadowverse is a great experience, especially if you know how to treat it (as a game). Don't be afraid to give it a chance! You can't waste your time if you're at least a little bit interested in the game. I hope this helped you in some way!"
,Recommended,453480,29936375,Posted: 14 February,all,immekc,"I've played Shadowverse for around 35 hours and I would like to say this game is great! I love the way they used a HS style and managed to make a unique game.  Allow me to make a few comparisons to its big bro HS.  What makes the game stand out to me is being able to evolve cards.  Shadoowverse has many things which make it unique much like HS. The evolution of cards changes the game in a few ways much like the hero power does in HS for each class.  Not to mention each class has something unique about it on top of the evolution of cards. I'll go over a few things I like.So the evolution of cards change 2 things I can think of at this moment.  Allow me to list them.1.  Who goes first and last has changed in more then one way,  but its not complicated.  If you go first you get two evolution orbs.  If you go second you get 3 and draw 2 cards on your first turn.   This means 2nd player will be evolving a card on their turn before the other, but the 1st can get board control faster.  And board control is everything in a game where you choose which minion you want to evolve for value.2. Evolution cards allow cards to be two cards in one!  When you evolve a card it can attack a minion that turn. (not the hero tho)  So most cards will get a +2/+2 buff when evolved but most cards will have an ability which activates when it is evolved.  A card thus is a triple edged sword in this game.   The common cards are usually balanced in stats with more rare cards, but the evolution of a card can allow a cards function really shine.Just like HS and its hero power each class has its own strengths which are unique to that class.  There is a dragon deck which can be compard to the Druid from HS, getting extra orbs for bigger minions.  Then there is a Vampire deck inwhich he harms himself and his cards become more powerful at 10 HP. THere are 7 classes total.The game gives us a few things I can mention like taunt, charge, spell immunity, bane, and life leech.  The game starts you off with 20 life instead of 30.  Making going face early game more viable with a strong evolved card with early board control.Also you make a deck of 40 cards instead of 30 and can have 3 cards of the same type instead of two.The F2P model is rewarding.  Within 20 hours you should have a good start on your first base set, not to mention everything else you earn along the way.  I've earned a bunch of arena tickets (about 10) and its fairly easy your first 20.  Arena rewards are good.  2 out of 5 wins and you get a pack and 40 gold. (costs 150 an arena entery or 100 gold a pack)  Any more wins is profit.  The arena is 30 cards,  they show two pairs of cards and you pick one pair until you have 30. Finding the balance of cards is interesting especially with rarities and card costs can differing with each pair of cards.A few smaller things i like in this game are:1. The dailys. 2. Rewards for completing achievments. 3. The beginning of a story being told for each class which has been expanded. 4. The balance. 5. Graphics are nice. 6. Linked accounts to iphone and android and an all round nice community.  7. You can turn off emotes and don't see your enemies names so that can take alot of trolling and pressure off of ranked.I recommend this game to anyone who has tried HS and say what it offers is unique executed very well.  Give it a shot! :)"

76561198218700419,Recommended,453480,29800081,Posted: 9 February,all,amadteaparty,"Great game.  Similar to hearthstone but without a lot of the problems that hearthstone has.Tons of rewards for new players to help them get right into the game.  After the tutorial they give you 40+ free packs and then from beating the ai with the characters you get free take two tickets (draft mode) and unlock some great cards that you'll be using in your decks for a very long time (some are standard in high ranked meta decks).  Their individual stories are interesting and not too long.  They give you a daily reward just for logging in and 3 quests.  If you want to be a free player it's far easier to do so vs other ccgs.The evolve mechanic is great.  Starting on turn 4 The player that went second can evolve a minion which gives it a buff (and on specific cards triggers an ability) and allows it to attack on the turn it's played.  The player that went first gets two uses of this ability, the player that went second gets three.  It really helps balance out the initial advantage of going first and leads to very interesting gameplay/stratagies.The draft mode (take two) has you choose two cards for your deck at a time between two pairs of cards.  This leads to some very interesting decisions.  Do you take the two cards that are both just ok quality or do you take the pair that has one good card and one not so great card.If you do want to spend some money they have several pre-built decks for you to buy that have strong legendaries in them and are worth the $.  If you just want packs they have a daily deal where you can buy a pack a day at half the normal price.I love the card art in this game, it's very well done.  The animations are great as well.The makers of this game really seem to care about their players time.  I've gotten many free packs from when they were a couple of hours late on an update... and I wasn't even around trying to play the game at the time.Highly reccomended."

76561198037628843,Recommended,453480,30079790,Posted: 21 February,all,arad0,"Play style of this game is much similar to hearth stone.It is good and bad things both this game is having.But there are some points why Shadowverse is better than HS.I played a little initial version of MTG by single playing game version almost 10 years ago and I am experienced Yugioh for years. I played HS in open beta season and blackrock season. But I didn't played HS long time and didn't pay my money for that because it isn't worthy for that. But Shadowverse isn't. Although it is phone based game and contents are smaller than HS, basic systems are showing more completeness.1) Optimization on battle system/sequence by ""evolution""Basic battle system and aim for this game is differed by this evol point.Play time is much short and battle details are more flexible in situations.It is not the perfect answer for boring and non-flexible HS style combat system but it can be estimated as one of the simplest answer for that.Only addition of this evol system is making more various fun situations.It is good pros of this game with 2)2) more flexible and decent special talents of cards (relatively not-restricted special rules)If you compare special abilities of cards in SV, you could feel it's texted abilities are more strong or more flexible.Yeah I agree there are also many dull cards but standard gaps between skill powers against HS are much larger.It reminds me card skilles shown in MTG. So flexibility of situations are larger than HS.It could be one of the bad point in HS, not good point of SV. But at least I think flexibility of SV is good enough to play fun.As I said in 1) and 2), rule and vision of this game is watching is much better than HS. That's right thing and it release my complains from HS.3) SV gives more chance to get card or packs. So if you are no-pay player, you don't have to get pain from inner conflict for money. I think it's just a personal matter but you know, just try this game whatever you are gonna leave or not.But also it has various cons too.1) Because the origin of this game is phone game base, some points of UI is not comfortable.If I want to see large size card image, I must click many times to get it from 'cards' tap. If I am playing vs match or I am in deck maker tap, I cannot see them in full size. Actually it is not critical point but bad thing is bad thing.2) You know, I like this game and like beutiful images too but... otaku or whatever... people say like it.I wish there would be various card images covering various spectrum of artistic styles.THERE ARE TOO MANY GIRLS BRO. I AM NOT A GAY But I want more MAN images.My favorite card is Ice blade warfiend in vamp.I understand. They made idol master or other games and they had success from them.But I wish Cygames understand that sexuality is not the only sales point of this game.3) You can get high value cards easily but gaps between high value cards vs bronze are very big.They are also good bronze cards but very many cards are useless. They are not useless only in higher rank games but also useless in initial decks for newbies. It's not that big problem and other games have similar issues too. Also difficulty to get gold or legendary in SV is not that harsh. But the bad thing is bad thing.Because there are too many useless cards in low valued bronze cards, deck making choices are very restricted. Though the game is started recently and it's initial state of the game, core/good cards and trash cards are extremely classified. This phenomenon is shown less in gold and legendary. But for core sets or cards are restricted, some leader has little option for making various decks. I think It is one of the most important issue SV is facing now.Yeah just let's see what would come in next season.4) Though the rules are much better than HS as I said above, those are not perfect and having balance issues too.winrate between 1st turn and 2nd turn is very different in various decks and too much OP decks are hard to play against. It is also related to problem 3).If someone is having fullset of 1 tier deck and the opponent is not having key card to counter or finish enemy, it is very clear to win in match. In my country, It is called as like that ""they just play game alone watching wall"". If you have OTK decks or Full-defense and seraph special win decks, there is very little interactions against opponent and decision making situations.5) Lack of national voice support.In steam version, only ENG version of text and voice sounds are supported.I wish to hear it as Jap version or KOR version because I'm korean.Those voices I can hear them in twitch streams are charming but absence of those language and voice support is very big disadvantage of steam users.I really want them all can be used. At least, I wish cygames make make available it in creative forums because there are unofficial kor version patch.I can update it not officially but if it would be possible in steam itself, it would be more helpful to me and I also want to hear Jap voices too.I think it is not that hard and wish to be done.One more I want to emphasize is the balance issue. As many people are blaming this point, some of decks are very annoying and disgusting to play against. It is not different from ""difficult"". 1~2 tier decks usually and strongly counter very broad spectrum of ""normal"" decks.Also most of high tier decks are too much strong in draw plays. Even OTK elf is very fast and have strong draw ability. Wall deck Bishop, Tempo WITCH are also drastically strong at just drawing and keeping cards.The balance problem is making this game worse and worse."

,Recommended,453480,30221441,Posted: 27 February,all,The Anvil,"So far, this is the only turn-based game - digital or not, card game or not - that I have ever seen which managed to fix the going first problem. There are games thousands of years old that fail to think of this sort of solution, so hats off to that. It's still impossible for them to be 50/50 in split though, as certain decks still prefer either 1st or 2nd depending on its aggressive nature. Perhaps another millenium of game design experience can help with that.I've played every high-profile digital card game at this point. I will not mention their faults by name, but Shadowverse does not have terrible design decisions such as: mana screws, consistent FTKs, fatigue mechanics, anti-competitive push, wide-range randomness, anti-f2p practices, shadow lane.What Shadowverse offers over its competitions: very generous business model, active community and support, the going first fix as mentioned above, variety of archetypes (as I will explain below), replays, very transparent chances in terms of card pulling, great community support in terms of balance and communication, actual interesting single player content.What Shadowverse doesn't, and should, have: built-in tournament mode, a greater variety of missions, better Take Two balancing, perhaps more unique game modes, but most importantly a functional, clean desktop UI.Now let's talk about balance for a short bit. At the moment of writing, we're in the post-nerf RoB meta. Here's to get it out of the way: every class is viable in Masters, and every class has at least 2 archetypes that is viable, and I'd dare say the only reason these (2) classes have less variety is because their good decks are so strong. Outside of this, meme decks are viable across the ladder, things like Earth Rite, PTP, Nepthys, Lord Atomy, Rose Queen and many more aren't tournament viable, but they are fun, different, and can definitely work if you're invested. I cannot think of a single card game, that isn't 2007 Yugioh or Faeria that has this kind of variety, and Faeria is cross-class.There's a point here to be made about artstyle, but it does grow on you eventually (like everything else, to be fair). It's also free to play, collect, and compete, so yeah. I've spent $6 so far in this game, purely out of a sense of support that anything else."

The PvP section of the game is filled with imba decks that will wipe out beginners within a few turns. Gamebreaking cards that destroy all of your units in a single swipe or just like that make every enemy unit evolve at once (which gives them a huge bonus) are enough to make everyone who isn't pay-to-win want to quit.Because there are only 2 (free) ways to progress in this game. Either by gathering the low rewarding daily login bonus for the end of time until you can afford some decent decks with the ingame currency or playing pvp and get beaten in 6 out of 10 games because the game can't put you against equal players. From the remaining 4 games 2 will be players who quit right away or just do nothing to stall time (for whatever reason) and then quit. The last 2 of 10 are games that you might actually win.

You get TONS of gold and free packs, while declining oly a little bit in income later. There is no paywall or super grinding after initial rewards.There is no one dominate play style. Unlike Hearthstone which caters to aggro, Shadowverse's meta is always changing and adapting due to players countering. There are very rarely any buffs or nerfs to card.Much less RNG than Hearthstone. There are very few cards that draw or do things randomly, and the cards that do, are still very particular in what they do so you can still control the outcomeSteam and Mobile versions can be linked so you can play on the goRanking rewards reset each month, however your actual rank doesnt.Cons:UI could use a rework but its functionalSome of the art is very suggestive which can be a problem if you're playing in publicSome of the voice acting is terrible, but rest are fineThe premium currency (Crystals) seem a bit expensive, but the game is already F2P friendly enough."

Don't let the art style push you away, it dissuaded me at first, but I'm so glad I tried it because it quickly became my current favorite game and definitely favorite CCG by far. The devs are attentive, there is so much support, events and free cards given just to promote the community on a regular basis. It's entirely possible to play to Master without spending a dime but with the fantastic support the game receives you'll find yourself willing to spend just to support the kindness. What are you waiting for? It costs nothing to try. Thank the devs later."

76561198002397815,Recommended,453480,30234704,Posted: 27 February,all,Cancer,"P2W vs Hearthstone: Either very (generous / heinous). Booster packs are somewhat 'fair', with rates for each card revealed officially. Many bronze/silver tier cards are viable. However there are 2~3 really powerful class legendaries that you (want to / have to) stuff the deck with full three copies for serious jump in win rates - Game allows you to buy the same starter deck three times for that reason more or less.Gameplay: Some matchups can be very stagnant. They do their own thing, you do yours, and maybe once every three turns Haven and Rune will react to your turn. Hell, if the game let them do it, I'm sure they'd throw single target removals against an empty board out of force of habit. Aggro Swordcraft floods the board every turn and doesn't care how you deal with it, but at least there is a war of attrition to be fought there.In the end everything is balanced because everything is OP, sort of. Except poor fairies, combo system isn't friendly to them yet.Audiovisual: You're playing this instead of Hearthstone because of dem waifus. Illustrations are large enough to appreciate them as CCGs tend to be.Overall: Nice distraction, probably worth investing a few starter decks, good fun being in the middle of the pack playing suboptimal decks, but the climb to top isn't appealing."

The moment after passing the tutorial, I already fallen in love with the game.But I was a bit too late, since it's already on Darkness Evolved expansion pack and I'm missing many free stuffs. Nevertheless, I still enjoy playing the game until this day..--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Latest update: Memeforged Legends!Darkness Evolved => My starting point. Elana Seraph Garuda combo so cool!Rise of Bahamut => My passion for a certain lightning stirike officer was born.. but Daria said, ""Leave it to me!"".Tempest of The Gods => The rise of dragon gods burst damage got nerfed! Say hello to Saltylord Eachtar.Wonderland Dreams => OP Neutral decks, funny overpowered legendaries. Eagle ""nerfed"" finisher!Starforged Legends => So many memes support oriented. Gonna love that alluring guitar strings of memes.Thanks Cygames for making such an excellent mobile game available on Steam!I was hiatus for a while, but now I'm back with more cash to spent for my husbandos and waifus in form of animated cards.Do not fret, F2P Players, there are many free stuffs given, even though you need to rely a bit on your luck.Had spent more than 110,000 crystals on this game (I can't even remember how much I've spent lol), and I guess it's worth the experience given from the salty players here (as you can see in the reviews section), the facebook community, and the neverending memes from many Japanese youtubers and international players alike.Competitive and all nerfs have excellent reasoning.But, as for the newest expansion release.. I have doubt in cygames testers, per se.Enjoy your stay, may luck bestows upon you in your journey towrards the Nexus!Don't even try to grind being those filthy tryhards in game just to reach the highest rank possible..Just enjoy the game to the fullest, as many Japanese card games teach us to!-------What I like from this game is the variety of races and species introduced by Japanese style. From cute girls / seductive older women, handsome boys / manly older men, holy and unholy beings, dragons, devils, zombies, and much more! Not to mention those cool animations and voice-acting (in Japanese) when you play the cards on the field and when you play the story.I never got bored with it, always yearning for more in the next expansion.Almost a year had passed, I don't mind playing it again for 2-3 years in the future. I prefer this game rather than spending cash on real trading card games (or the other premium CCG of this kind by the well-known developer, because it's not my preference)This game really gives me the laughs over the difficult time of my lfie, even though sometimes this game is the one who made me stressed out and bringing so much hatred.It's just like aneverending love and hate relationship~"

Steam version cannot link to another device, so players are denied a Daily slot.-Daily missions use the Hearthstone mandate of ""Win,"" making for a frustrating string of losses for classes people don't want to play. Only one mission may be rerolled a day.-BRUTAL demand for good cards and Hearthstone-esque crafting restrictions. People will restart entire accounts just to stand a chance with their initial draws.-No Matchmaking on Unranked.-Ranked becomes an invincible wall of meta decks as early as Beginner 2, making progression and income slow to achieve.-Strange emphasis and overvaluation of ""Take Two"", the Arena mode, which is five matches guaranteed, despite the appearance of being kicked out with no reward after one loss.-Immense RNG power. Imagine a set of fingers being smashed repeatedly with a hammer. That's what it feels like to have bad luck in this game."
,Not Recommended,453480,29910113,Posted: 13 February,all,Yusu,"The game plays really well, especially because of the ""evolve"" mechanic.You get an incredible amount of free cards at the beginning and from some early quests. This makes the first few hours a blast.However, the second player has a HUGE advantage, making some games feel like a coin-toss between who has to start.Also, the meta sucks. If you don't like playing aggro, midrange or zoo, you are in bad luck pretty much. Because of the lack of comeback mechanics and AoE (except for Bahamut, which is a legendary) there is almost no way of stopping the bleeding as a control deck.I really wanted this to be the CCG that really hooks me, and it did for a while. Sadly, I was dissapointed by the meta and cards that are in the card pool right now."
,Recommended,453480,29968142,Posted: 16 February,all,Necrobern,"Gameplay has many similarities to Hearthstone, but that's when learning the basics. Each class as you can expect has their own mechanics, but even with (right now) three expansions there's good versatility to create all kinds of Decks. Sure that there's the fear of facing the meta/tier decks on higher ranks, but its card pool allows creativity enough to make many things work together. Finally there's its unique feature called Evolution, a limited resource that can turn arround games or give you an immediate answer against opponent actions. This mechanic is what makes the game stand out compared to others, as managing its use is the main learning curve of the game.The game also gives a big welcome to new players with several rewards on the go, and along a very friendly card pull ratio soon enough you can build a solid deck in a pair of days. And even if you are in bad luck is not difficult to make low budget decks with the cards available. However keep on mind that some classes are harder to learn than others, being the main challenge to learn the game (Like Swordcraft is newbie friendly by summoning and boosting small monsters, while Havencraft requires stalling and shortcuts for their cards to start working). There's also Take Two (Arena or Draft format), which by default gives you a pack by trying and other bonuses the more wins you get, and you can get tickets for free by simply playing Ranked.With all sorts of ways to earn packs with high pull ratio, a diverse card pool allowing many strategies to work regardless of budget, and many game modes to tutorial newcomers through all its mechanics, is a solid card game which sets you ready to face other newcomers and experts after a few hours learning. Just keep on mind that the game is quite aggro encouraging with its Evolution mechanic along certain effects, so might give you a negative experience if you don't learn the matchups. Overall, a solid game for anybody who wants to try a card game but don't wanna wallet through to make a decent Deck, as well those who got tired of other card games and wanna start with a solid build immediately."

For example in the swordcraft decktype all sword craft cards have the distinctinction of either being officer or commander cards, officers are meant to be the lightweight bulk of your attack while the typically stronger commander cards buff them.Overall  this is already becoming my favorite CCG out ther and I would reccomend it over hearthstone."

Must finish the tutorial to access options where you can then select resolution and change it to 60FPS.  Why it even has a 30FPS option on PC is beyond me."

76561197993879350,Recommended,453480,29783976,Posted: 8 February,all,FenWolf,"A fairly decent CCG that I'd recommend.The art is incredible and surprisingly it has a voice acted campaign for each of the main heroes you get with the game. The campaigns are fairly short and have a simplistic storyline but it's still worth a quick pay, especially for a free game. Would honestly recommend the campaign over nearly any aspect of it.It has an interesting variety of cards however certain heroes do feel somewhat limited in the styles of play.It has the same problem most CCGs have though. It feels fairly ""pay to win"" in terms of buying a lot of packs to get good cards and does rely on large elements of luck. Sure, you can be lucky with your starter packs that are given to you (quite a generous number too) and get something solid but that's based on luck. It's sad that the first time I played this, someone else immediately told me a strategy to keep getting new starters until I was lucky enough to get a good haul.There are certain cards that when brought out will near enough mean the end of the game if you have a fairly basic deck. That has always been the case in CCGs though, but thought I should draw attention to this to make peope aware that the problem has not been fixed in this game. You will routinely find yourself absolutely annihilated at the start of the game especially if you play competitives or even advanced computer players because most of the time they will simply have better cards than you."

Since even customization options can be earned in game or unlocked through ranking, it doesn't feel at all like the usual cash grabbing free games.I must also commend it for it's art. Many cards are absolutely gorgeous, and I would buy an art album if one was available. The voice acting also impressed me."

,Recommended,453480,29732293,Posted: 5 February,all,𝔩𝔞𝔫𝔡𝔴𝔥𝔞𝔩𝔢,"If you own a mobile device and enjoy CCGs, you've probably played Hearthstone at some point. I quickly grew frustrated with it after a few hours due to many, many cards choosing not only random targets but sometimes random damage and random effects. Thankfully Cygames came along and improved on Blizzard's design decisions with Shadowverse. Although it isn't perfect, this is currently my CCG of choice because of the smooth cross-platform play, simple yet engaging game design choices, and the generous free-to-play elements.I've stuck with Shadowverse for so long compared to Hearthstone because of how much they've improved on the formula by simply cutting back on RNG and narrowing the power levels of cards. At first I was a bit shocked to see that you can only have five cards total in play at any time; however, as I played more classes I realized that many cards are actually balanced around this. You will almost never see a card in another CCG that says ""Summon X of Y until the battlefield is full"". The majority of cards let you choose targets, provide exact numbers, and have clearly defined interactions while still managing to fit in voice acting and flavor text for both the normal & evolved versions of each cards. This is the first mobile CCG I've played that is actually engaging & robust enough to feel like an actual card game.Being a collectible card game, you'd expect some heavy-handed ""P2W"" elements. Coming from Magic: The Gathering, where non-rotating decks can easily cost over $500, I was pleasantly surprised to see how cheap individual boosters are, how easily you can craft the cards you need to make a cohesive deck, and how many freebees the devs hand out. You have dailies which reward in-game currency for simple tasks like winning matches, a daily login reward system which doesn't penalize ""missing"" days (and refreshes instantly after cycling instead of cycling once a month like most mobile games), and free booster handouts for major events like tournaments and new expansions. If you do choose to spend money on boosters, you are incentivized to log in daily to purchase a booster for 50 crystals (which comes to $0.99 if purchased on impulse).I also have many more hours on Shadowverse than shown on Steam because of how smooth the cross-platform play is. All devices are linked through your Cygames account and share the same clean UI which, although slightly clunky because of no scaling on PC, makes the game very easy to pick up and play on my PC, phone, and tablet. This is probably the first CCG I've played where having a match run away from me hadn't made me rage because I was too comfortable lying on my couch swiping animated cards on my tablet.Of course, nothing is perfect and Shadowverse has its share of problems created by new design decisions that I'm afraid will never be addressed. At the start of each match, there is a ""coin toss"" to decide who goes first without a chance to pass. Of course, if there were an option to pass, almost everyone would given the huge advantage the second player has. From a MTG perspective, going first is advantageous for aggressive decks because (although you don't draw) you can play and attack first. In Shadowverse though the person going first still draws but the person going second drawstwiceand gets an extra evolution point. What's an evolution point? One of the new gameplay mechanics Cygames added is the ability to ""evolve"" your cards: each follower can be transformed with additional stats and occasionally new triggers. In my opinion these two bonuses give a huge advantage to the second player which is unwarranted considering how bad 1-drops are.Being a Japanese game, there are also huge card balancing issues: like most CCGs, there are individual cards that are powerful enough to shift the meta and create a miserable conveyor belt of netdecks ready to steamroll you. Typically cards like these will get banned or balanced but so far there has been no action taken against obvious offenders. In fact, the devs have gone so far to say they don't think these cards are causing problems despite what you hear from high ranking players in both the Steam & official forums. Even without the meta-warping cards, all classes have a few cards which define their archetypes's build paths, creating a barrier for entry when trying to play a different class than the one you've spent all your vials on.For now, I am cautiously optimistic for Shadowverse's future. Hopefully Cygames wakes up and acknowledges some of the issues and either creates a ban list for ranked or a Standard format to cycle out cancerous cards. In my opinion, this is currently the best mobile and best digital CCG available and I would recommend it for newcomers to the genre and veterans alike."

It's a game you easily can play very scattered in time.I will play this game more. I didn't encounter any technical issues with it.
