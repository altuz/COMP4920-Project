I mean, what is here, is great. I am excited to play some local co-op this weekend. There is no online multiplayer.I played through the existing 9 holes twice in about half an hour, solo style. It is probably the best minigolf game I've played.I am going to give this a thumb's up for being fun for a mere three bucks, BUT you need to be aware that while the developers may add more holes, it very well could never happen."

It was fun to play through as a family (local) and I suspect we will play through quite a few times more before we're bored of it.The only real downside is that there are only 9 holes, but the 9 holes are all very nice and for 2.99 (half of a trip to Starbucks) I can't really complain.  Hopefully there will be more holes added in the future.  Even if they're 1.99 per 9 hole DLC, I'd buy it.Good work.  Fun game."

76561198031343965,Recommended,453680,25444755,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,lgaskins,"First  review  ever:Recommendated,  but only if you want minimumal content and no Dev. communication or updates.Minigolf Mania  has  the  best `feel' of any minigolf game on Steam. It's very  simple, and the TALENTED Devs do a great job in making the game play and feel  easy to pick up and enjoy.  These guys know  how  to make a  quality simple  game.Sadly just like No Man Sky, these  developers  have  zero communication  with  the  buyers  of  this  game.  They  promise upgardes  soon, and never  deliver. Seems  like  they  simply:  do... not... care.  A hole/level creator  could give the  community  a great  tool  to  expand this  game (and have others to increase sales),  but  it  has  never been released.No  multiplayer,  but  co-op.  and the  worst  thing:  JUST NINE HOLES!To  sum-up. Fantastic potential, zero updates  for almost half a year. NO COMMUNICATION.  Many buyers of this  game   feel  slighted as  well as believe that this  has  been  bandoned.  I  hope  not!PS:  So if 3 dollars  is  okay  for  9 holes,  I  reccomend it,  but just nine holes... I  am  going  to say- No.  Sorry, cause  the  engine  and  working of MiniGolf Mania are wonderful!"
,Recommended,453680,33358968,Posted: 7 July,all,Bedrock,"This game is so cool, the graphics are fantastic, better than golf with friends graphics, when golf with friends gets a course creator this will alredy have one, cheap Cheap CHEAP, I could aford this when I had less than 10 dollars then got golf with friends then got this, course creator is great even if it's a bit finicy. Overall this game is amazing, and it's only $2.99, so almost anyone can buy it! If you have the money and you like minigolf you should get it, even if there are not many holes in the game at the time you buy it. So get this game and play some minigolf!"
,Not Recommended,453680,33471061,Posted: 11 July,all,squeezit,"Pros:-Pretty graphics-Good physics-Decent controls-Good price for what it isCons:-Not enough levels-Some of the levels are extremely unfair if you don't follow the gimmick (like the one you need to jump in the wall then stop before you fall off). I think if you essentially MUST trickshot to get a par at the most, that's just overkill, which goes into my next con:-No practice mode (Whenever I make a silly mistake I have to restart all over)-Ball color keeps changing to a random color-Course creator is ultra buggy. Things will disappear, things will refuse to delete/be selected, so I constantly have to restart.-CC has no essential tools, like standard walls? Copypasting the generic cube prop isn't very user friendlyPrice is reasonable for the game as a whole, but there are plenty of better things i can do with that cash. I'd like to enjoy multiplayer in this too, but I feel the same irritations will occur when playing with a buddy. If anyone is searching for a straight-forward, forgiving, and chill golf/putt game, I can't say this is it.Edit: Appreciate the response. I would like to see this play a lot better, the fact it's still currently being updated is good."

,Recommended,453680,22054544,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Pharaoh Atem,Only nine holes at the moment which take about 20 minutes to beat. Solid control system and worth the $3.I look forward to more holes and a custom map editor that the developer has mentioned is on their to-do list.

However gets dull quick without new courses and editor. With editor though will be great. Can't wait to make some courses

Controls well etc but it's way too short to justify the price tag of £1.99!Iv'e read other reviews and seen this described as a demo and I am enclined to agree.Sorry but I can't recomend it because I do not think it is really a full game and don't think it should be sold as such!

76561198134939036,Recommended,453680,22096642,"Posted: 27 March, 2016",all,ShawnEBear,Now. All though I do recommend this game at a 3 dollar price tag. I could go through the only course in the game in about 20 minutes. It would of been nice to have a cpu player playing with me but it is only solo. And if there is cpu I can't figure it out. That I find dissapointing. The course is well designed. and it is fun for 20 minutes but unless you have friends that have the same game you might as well save your 3 bucks. 5/10

The balls don't bounce off them far enough. Music and SFX were a bit obnoxious IMO. Other than that, I liked it. For $3 its worth it."

,Recommended,453680,22601384,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,Grayson,"So they're either the devs of Minigolf Adventures, or this is an homage to it.Either way, devs? Please increase the price, so that you can afford to spend more time building levels.Solid, worth more than $3, and the only downside is the tiny course selection.There are 3 things that 3D Ultra did better, though:- Your power meter is too precise. Take out the notches, because they make the courses too solvable.- Click-through ball-settling, please!- Deserves more content, and it'd be worth paying more money to get it."
