[Written during Early Access Phase / ~10 Hours into the Game]+ HeroQuest flair!+ Lovely Artworks+ Grinding and Looting Deluxe+ Soundtrack very fitting+ Coop feels just awesome+ Great Support!- Mechanics can be exploited pretty easily (terms of leveling)- Skill cap reached pretty quickly- (Minor) Teething problems, but no bugs so far!- Replayability, long-term motivation, balancing questionable (at this point of the development)Short but fun experience, especially for Tabletop Roleplay aficionados! Definitely something to keep an eye on."

Nothing complicated, just easy time wasting fun.  And perfectly suited to the price point.  Multiplayer needs some work, namely a lobby or drop-in and out play, but its in early access. I look forward to seeing where the developers take this.  Oh and co-op.  This game needs local co-op."

I will tell you from a time of darkness...It all took place in a world, similar to one we know, but different enough to be worth another story.Were a handful of heroes gathered to defeat the evil sorcerer Zantor. For ages he dwelled in the darkness, raising his foul minions unter his iront fist, and one after the other, free lands fall before him.Mighty castles turned into lairs of terror, swarmed by his minions, til a few remaining heroes gathered:The wild barbarian, the wise wizard, the studdy dwarf, the mysterious dark monk, the swift archer and the honorable knight. Together, under the leadership of the barbarian warrior, they march towards the darkest of all places in the world: Zantors Keep.Be the way were long and danger were everywhere. The first quest were easy, not more than a tutorial for the barbarian, who were alone in the beginning, til the wizard found him and together, they did another quest. And another, and...Reaching a village that no map knows, they realized the adventure has even just begun.More enemies raised upon them, deadly traps waited patiently for their blood, and in every shadow, there were these eyes. Watching, waiting.The villagers had them welcome and here the heroes found, whatever they could need:A blacksmith, crafting weapons and armor, even artifacts.An old Woman, selling potions of strange herbs - useful, but unstable in quality.A sage of the old realms, who tought our heroes to master her abilities.A Merchant, buying juwels and items the heroes didn't need anymore.And the gravedigger, who could even brought back the dead (and were the richest men in town).The tavern provided a rest for the wounded, while the brothel...well :)And there he were. The eldar. A strange old man, who sent for the barbarian and his mates.He gave them advice and - more important - quests.Rescue the dwarf he said, for the dungeons get bigger and harder as you proceed, and 2 heros soon won't be enough.The tale seems simple young lad, but you surely will be entertained well. The fights were simple, the graphic and sound nostalgic. The devs of the kingdom were busy these days, even in the forums, what is always a good sign.Go now, adventurer. Go for the honor, for the gold and get your own tale to tell...."

By far, this game's greatest strength is its co-op campaign. My friends and I took to this game almost instantly for its fantasy setting, turn-based combat, and online co-op. VERY few games fall into that category.So, selling points on the game:- online co-op campaign, easy to use invites through steam.- very huge improvement from the first Dark Quest, I mean you can really appreciate the game so much more if you play or even look at the first one.- very well done art, making for a very visually pleasing experience.- great tactical combat, but think more ""board game"" than actual D&D- interesting characters, 7 total at this time...looks like there might be room for 3 more?- persistency between maps, you keep equipment, potions, gold and whatnot, interact with the village.- great replayability, the maps increase in difficulty after you beat them, so replaying actually does provide a challenge.- super cheap for the hours of playtime you'll get!- simple but effective story. Bad sorceror in giant castle torments the town, and he has an army of goblins, orcs, and undead. What more do you need here?Cons:- there are a few bugs here and there, it's Early Access- sometimes, you'll find yourself wishing for more (like, dang I wish there were more characters, dang I wish we could further customize these characters, or dang I wish my equipment showed up on my character) but remember, it's Early Access- you have to start with only the Barbarian and the Mage, then beat the first 5 levels if you wanted a specific other character (Devs if you're reading this, can we pick our starting heroes please?) but once again, Early Access!In summary, all of the (admittedly minor) faults I found in this game, I was able to forgive because it is absolutely charming, super fun to play with 2 more of your friends, and if something didn't work for whatever reason...I just found myself saying ""Oh well it's Early Access"".I'll be creating an account on their forums soon to list the few bugs we found, and maybe highlight some areas where the game could easily gain some free points with players. But overall, I absolutely recommend this game. It's a real winner, and I love supporting hard-working indie devs just like this."

This game is being updated and built upon on a roughly bi-weekly basis. The last update unlocked more levels, patched errors and the developers asked for feedback on making new quests and balance issues.As for price and gameplay, for the first the game may have only had 12-14 accessable levels a month or two ago from the time of this review, but its growing now. Read the description of the game.  And the gameplay, if you don't see gameplay footage on the store page go to youtube to check the game out to see if it's for you.Been playing games since the mid 80's, and this is one of the funnest I have ever played. Its simple, addictive, a little flawed - but getting better each and every week with great updates. I've finished all the levels but there are another 8 levels they are still working on that I am looking forward to playing. Each class has 7 ability/spells that you can claim and then upgrade and you can craft gear to better prepare yourself in different levels. Having a shield will protect you from arrows, important when those goblin archers have you in their sites. Its worth a try, and now I'm going for DQ1  !!"

An added bonus is the mapeditor for infinite content to even extend replayability.Pros:- dungeons- loot- multiplayer- mapeditor- great soundtrackCons:- more keyshortcuts would be nice"

76561197970435474,Recommended,453690,32778659,Posted: 25 June,all,Vargas78,"This is very much a heroquest inspired game and fans of that board game will probably get more out of this than people who never played that.The graphics are a great improvement over the first game and look pretty nice with an 80's cartoon/tabletop feel and i find the quests fun. There's also a dungeon builder tool which will greatly improve the longevity and provide entertainment in itself if creating dungeons is your thing. And a possibility of a procedural generated based expansion coming up which would be awesome if done right.Those complaining about the games difficulty may have not noticed that you can replay earlier dungeons, which whilst grindy, is a good way to make sure you are well equipped and prepared for the more difficult dungeons. I also like the in game global chat, tales of maj'eyal has something like that too and its a good way to ask advice from other players if the numbers are there.So, good game, glad i finally got around to getting it! :)"
,Recommended,453690,26484398,"Posted: 7 November, 2016",all,Juiceman,"** Note: I haven't put a ton of time in yet, but I believe I have enough experience to write a review of the early access status of the title.Dark Quest 2 is a turn based RPG that reminds me of Darkest Dungeon. I make that comparison in all the best ways especially in the way that, like Darkest Dungeon, this game might be in early access but is full of content, mostly bug free and already has solid gameplay mechanics that are fun and engaging.You control a party of heroes in a quest to defeat an evil sorcerer. To do this, you must do battle in a series of dungeons while managing your team in town between missions. It's very addicting and well worth the budget price tag.Pros- Great art style and music- Challenging but fair gameplay- Runs great and is easy on the walletCons- Settings and characters are really genericSuggestions- Would be great if the maximum movement restriction could be removed when rooms are free of enemies. Kinda annoying having to switch between your characters 2-3 times just to move through an empty room- Keybindings plz?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXHiJSBb_zo"
,Recommended,453690,34739945,Posted: 4 September,all,TangyPop,"CategoryPoints*DescriptionGameplay7Controls are intuitive. It's a point-and-click board game. Difficulty comes from strategy behind how to approach enemies and avoid traps.Content5The game has an overworld similar to Super Mario World and a common area in a village for purchasing supplies, healing, and hiring new party members. Each level (quest) is a series of rooms reminiscent of the Hero Quest board game and take a decent amount of time to get through. I only have a couple of hours in the game as of this review, but could imagine it taking a good 20 hours to complete. Online co-op is also present, but we had difficulties keeping connection and staying in synch.Graphics7Graphics are better than what you would typically expect for a board game. Character and environmental artwork is nice, animation is fluid if somewhat stretchy looking. Overall the game looks nice.Audio7The sound effects are nothing special, but the music is good. Some of the tracks remind me of Heimdall from the Sega CD days.Re-Playability5Re-Playability is probably average at best, at least until multiplayer and Steam Workshop is fully functional.Total6.3If you like table top RPGs a la Hero Quest or Dragon Strike, then give this game a go. However, if you want to do online co-op, hold off and keep an eye on its development.* Points are weighted by 35%, 25%, 20%, 10%, and 10% for gameplay, content, graphics, audio, and re-playability, respectively.Bang-for-Buck6At it's current state I wouldn't pay more than $8 or $9 for it. When the game is finished then it's full asking price of $13 will be a good value.Achievements1I can't give this a good score as one achievement is currently not attainable as it is for defeating a yet to be implemented enemy. Another achievement for getting 100k gold also is silly."

I get that it's early access, but I feel it would suit a mobile platform better where simple gameplay is ok and you play in short stints.It's not really the nostalgic old school adventure I expected.  I'd recommend buying it only if it's less than $5 and you don't expect more than a short casual adventure game for your tablet."

This game has no balance to it whatsoever.  There is dozens of ways your characters get screwed and very limited number of ways you can buff them to prevent that.  On top of that a lot of it is locked at the beginning to its a bunch of save and reload.You can't speedup the animations, yes there is an option for that, but it doesn't work.Nice graphics.  Responsive devs, still bugs being ironed out."

Less than $5 I can see but...no.Anyhoo.....I love the graphics; it's just the game play that got on my nerves ( and as you can see by how little I played the game you can tell how quickly it did so).A ""wizard"" that was only good for looting?
