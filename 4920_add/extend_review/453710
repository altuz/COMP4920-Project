,Recommended,453710,26325829,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Nickervision,I had some good fun with this game lately. Excellent little game for the price.Thing I liked:-RTS Soccer (football) is a really cool idea-Helpful tutorial-Ability to play on several platforms and cross platform-Looks like the dev is going to be updating again soon too-Easy price to justify (especially on a sale)Things that could use improvement:-Could use some more 'flash' or 'juice' to transitions and animations between events

Bought this game as a joke for myself and a friend to play for 66 cents and dont regret missing that McDonalds Double Cheesburger off the Dollar Menu. 11\10 WTB DLC!!!!!! Brock Holt for MVP!

You can customize the roster to your likings, so there is some kind of progression points you earn during matches and you can invest to improve your team members skills etcBest money/fun factor ratio"

It's simple enough to be accesible and involving enough to be enjoyable, scoring goals gives me a genuine kick (pun intended). I highly recomend this to anyone who enjoys frozen syanpse and is looking for a fun yet challenging game."

Customizable teams and players, abilities to upgrade and so on. Online play is clearly the best element, it just needs more people for the game to develop a better league/cup system, which it will in time. The developer is receptive to new ideas and changes, and the game is constantly progressing."

,Recommended,453710,23523069,"Posted: 12 June, 2016",all,periurban,"I have longed for a good tactical turn based football game, and this is that very thing.It doesn't play at all like football though! There are no random modifiers, and the skill tree is very limited. Progress seems quite slow, and the AI isn't quite good enough to provide robust competition (at least on the first two levels).But it does prove that the concept is sound. I'd like to see a more varied skill tree, and maybe a wee sub game for tackling? At present players simply run through one another (taking the ball off the man in possession every single time).It isn't an amazing game, but it is worth the money just for a wee play about with. Try out the daftest tactics you can think of. Have fun!"
,Recommended,453710,22623269,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,Super Tsar,"Great game made better with someone to play with, however online matchmaking works great even without too many playing at the moment. This is helped by the ""resumable"" games that allow you to play a turn at a time with the same player. Definitely worth the price and has tons of different ways to play your team, adding more replayability than expected. The planned additions look great and feedback on bugs/issues with the game has been fantastic and very quick.The Boosts add a nice extra touch to the mind games but they seem a little plentiful. So far boosts and the combo are necessities compared to the others. Finally, the difference in a new player with no upgrade points against even someone whose played for a few hours is incredible. Game is not unwinnable but being able to move twice as far and save every shot even point blank gets very frustrating,"
,Recommended,453710,33997493,Posted: 3 August,all,Yastermu,"WOW!What a game.This has been the best gaming purchace I have made EVER! I haven't sampled the multiplayer yet but the solo is amazing fun. If you can convince a few friends to drop the miniscule price (77p) then you will have hours of fun.My only problems are the lack of customization and a basic solo mode. Adding a league system is something that would keep me coming back and even something as simple as being able to select hair colour would be enough to please me.As it is though this is a solid game for the price and an amazing first game from the developer.Bravo Sir, Bravo."

Hopefully it catches on and more players start playing the multiplayer because it is a little quiet right now.  Playing the computer is fun enough for a bit, but the computer is extremely predicatable without much variation in tactics.  I would also like to see a little more variety in the player skins.  Seems there is just one look per race."

This is why I don't refund, I want this game to happen!Need to be polished A LOT. After 1-2 minutes in queue, no match was made and I quit.To fellow players: play solo and challenge friends, you can have fun with this and wait for updates.Hoping dev reads this:- get better 3D models, this is ridiculous in the bad way- also, get some pretty, or at least, well-designed sound effects, also music and fonts and everything (sorry :D )- you should probably provide info about how many players are in queue and how many matches are in progress, maybe an estimation on the time remaining in queueApart from that, I do recommend the game to increase its rating and get more players."
76561198285462028,Recommended,453710,22822151,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,akkoplay,"Cool, fast-action game for single or multi-player. I eventually got around to naming my team and choosing gender/uniforms, but what I like most is that I have to anticipate what my opponent might do and act accordingly. I can move all 5 players in one turn, and when the timer is up, I just hope I went the right way. The AI is easier to play against, but the real fun is playing others online as they are way more unpredictable.Boosts allow you to run faster, pass the ball, attach your player's movements to another player on the opposing team, and make combo shots (pass to another and then shoot to score).I first played this on IOS, and I like that resumable (offline, turn-based) games can be played here on steam or on my iPhone, depending on where I am. Lots of new players, so you can put your name in the queue and play a stranger, or make a friend and challenge them directly.I like the real-time games best, but it's cool that this is like ""Words with Friends"" for soccer (I take a couple of turns, and then I'm alerted when my opponent does the same).Awesome job, Developer!"

,Recommended,453710,22589200,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,Soul Rider,"This is an updated review.  My initial review is below.YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME.This is a great fun game. If you like turn based games, or you like Football, you really need to buy TableTop Soccer. Score goals, win games, earn points, upgrade your player stats, then go out and battle.  This game is good when playing the computer, but it gets taken to another level when you challenge another human.  Trying to predict what another player is going to do is such a challenge.  It's the sort of game that you want to play with friends, so you can gloat over your great plays.The developer of this game responded very quickly to my initial review and implemented my suggestions.  Not only that, but they have worked to fix issues and improve the game by taking suggestions from the community and implementing fixes.I cannot recommend the game or the developer enough.  I will definitely be buying this for  friends.Can I recommend for newer players picking this up you add a 4-pack?=================================================I was sold when I watched the first video.  I bought it, I played it, I loved it.. Then my internet connection died, and I became annoyed with it.It's a really fun game, but make sure you have a solid reliable internet connection.  If you have an internet connection that drops out, expect to lose your match progress in solo games.  The resumable game only works if you have saved the game, unfortunately the game doesn't auto-save after each turn is played.   For an online game, auto saving after each turn is a necessity when playing solo.If you don't have internet problems, do buy this game :)"

The reason I can't recommend this game is because you have to be online 24/7 just to to play Solo.
