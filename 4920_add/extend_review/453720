I have found it so full of bugs that I have been turned right off from continuing after a bug fix. The articles to obtain are repeated constantly and lack creativity. Great concept...but I am afraid that the frustrations have forced my had not to recommend
,Not Recommended,453720,26420609,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,Tallanvor,"This game should be listed as an early access release.  --It's not a bad game, and I probably would have bought it once it was finished, but with the continuing delays (now there's not even an estimate of when the final episode will be released) I just cannot recommend that anyone buy it until it is finished."
,Not Recommended,453720,29893671,Posted: 12 February,all,Homebrew,"I was on the fence about writing a negative review because I like to support small dev teams with great ideas, but this has game has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me (and friends) off too many times to keep me in their back pocket as an avid support. That being said, I'm going to provide a brief pros and cons list with a follow-up explanation if you want more details.Pros:- graphics are good enough for what they're trying to achieve- puzzles can occasionally provide an ""ah-ha!"" moment- atmosphere and backstory is a nice touchCons:- bugs. so many ♥♥♥♥ing bugs. the game should probably be in alpha- broken rooms requiring a restart (things open / complete breaking triggers and events)- falling through floors- multiplayer is an atrocity- inventory does not actually log notes and such, most of the time- carrying / rotating objects barely functions- some puzzles are obscure for the sake of being obscure- puzzles often bounce between cookie-cutter and stupid- typos. all of them. spellcheck would be a good start.- multiplayer occasionally means other players don't see what you see- placed objects are placed as other objects- puzzles often require rigorous note taking, not abstract thinking or logic (tedium)- price point is high considering the broken content- episodes get progressively more broken and challenging simultaneously, creating a face-punching rage- little to no ramping in difficulty. one room might be a 2/10, the next a 9- lantern existence is sporadic and unpredictable at best (especially in multiplayer)- messages might linger from one room to the next (darkroom in particular)- item text often inaccurateI'll stop there. If I was actually documenting every single issue while punching my keyboard I'd probably have a lot more, but those are just off the top of my head. This game should be in beta, or Early Access at best. The concept is rock-solid and intriguing, but the dev team... well, I don't need to bring my own professional credibility into this, so I'll just say I sure as hell wouldn't advise them to put this on their resume. It's unfinished, buggy, and borderline insulting to take such a killer concept and butcher it with bad code, a minimal team and lazy design. And every time I see one of the devs take a sincere approach to a complaint with ""what room did this happen in?"" or ""can  you please elaborate on when this happened"" all I can think is dude, this is not an edge case. This is garbage code and you know it. Stop trying to isolate it to an occurance that's an exception to the rule. This is essentially someone that doesn't know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing stabbing away at the Unity engine until they make a game just passable enough to sell on steam, and it's ruining the industry. You know god damn well how bad the code is. It's patchwork garbage and it's pretty obvious. But you know what? Start over, put it in Early Access, and do it right this time, and I'll still buy it. Until then, I'm done playing and/or convincing friends to waste their money. You ♥♥♥♥ed this up gloriously, and it's time to take responsibility. And seriously, 13 bucks for an alpha? Good god man, this team brings a whole new meaning to the term moral ambiguity.To my fellow steambros and ladies, I'm sure the concept itself is appealing, but read the other negative reviews. While some are angry because ""puzzles are hard, man!"" others are giving it to you straight, myself included. This is a bug-fueled nightmare you'll regret investing in. Set higher standards. Make devs earn a paycheck. We're not asking for a masterpiece, we're asking you to dev something better than a train wreck. That is all."

Paired best with a nice chardonnay and a few friends. I will say that the controls could be a little tighter in certain puzzles, but I'm excited for the content the developers will add. Adding extra lanterns in multiplayer would be nice, some rooms are really dark even with lamps on.7/10 - Nicely renovated from original escape room games. Awesome in multiplayer."

Most of the puzzles are challanging but solvable.  I am enjoying the game thus far and look forward to the other episodes being released. My biggest complaint is that there are misspelled words within the riddles, and I have to figure out whether the misspelling is part of the clue or simply bad editing."

It should have stayed in Beta / Greenlight another 6 months. Was excited for the next set of rooms (episode 2). Started playing it and realized the 2nd episode was even more unfinished than the 1st. Bugs and broken features.Not fun anymore. Maybe we'll check in on it again....----------------------------------------------My boyfriend and I were anxiously waiting for this game to come out, and are very happy that it has, finally! The game has really good puzzles and the randomizer makes for really fun replay value. It was like Myst meets escape room. Curious to see what online co-op is like. That being said...The game needs some work still. Devs, listen up.Please be aware this game is NOT GAMEPAD SUPPORTED. And does not save key configs.Our save game sort of saved. It brought us back to the same room, but the puzzle was different, so all our notes from the night before, useless. The ""Red Trailed"" room puzzle seems broken.Jerky motion when looking around, especially around clickables.Clicking on objects/multiple objects when not even facing them (scaring the crap out of us when the record player would start playing, omg, and chess pieces being Poltergeist-ed at us AHH!!)Other things like (un)intentional spelling errors in clues, gfx artifacts, etc. need to be cleaned up.And it would have been really nice to have an actual ending during Timed Mode, instead of feeling like we were trapped in a boring room with a locked door to nowhere.Last Will = 7 Useless Lanterns out of 10!"
,Not Recommended,453720,25718748,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,SwaggyPuff,"There are a lot of bugs currently, two specifically has to deal with losing save files and not being able to connect to your friend' games for multiplayer. This defintiely needs to be addressed soon.The game also is hindered by some delays (room 3 should've been out 23rd of Sept. 2016, the developer mentioned it being delayed until the 25th and it's now the 26th with no updates) and really easy puzzles. The game also makes an effort to randomize rooms for replayability but imho there isn't enough rooms currently to warrant the effectiveness of this. I find myself playing the same old puzzles and using the same strategies to solve the rooms -- it's somewhat monotone in nature.Ultimately, I do love the concept and the multiplayer aspect this game has to offer but at this stage I would stay away, maybe if the game was 5 USD I would recommend at its current timeline.___________Update:1. The menu where to change the resolution is bugged so I cant change from the horrible 720p format.2. When rejoining a multiplayer game, the items and/or hints are generated differently upon re-entering the game with your friends.3. There is several instances where if I could not connect to a multiplayer room, I would have to delete the game and re-download it so it will work properly.4. The game is shaping up pretty well in terms of content but the delays are killer (room 4).TLDR; should've stayed in the beta phase a couple more months like what another reviewer mentioned."

This game is basically in early access, even though it is not supposed to be. The random room setting requires multiple ( Like way, way too many) replays of the same puzzles to get to a room you have not uncovered. This overplaying merely seems like a way to pad how long you have played the game. The problem is that it only took me 10 minutes to solve 5 rooms, but it took hours and hours of replay to get to a room I have yet been to. I am still unable to get to two rooms after MULTIPLE playthroughs . The random generator this game uses is poorly optimized. Could be a decent game if they really thought out and tested potential bugs. This game should be called Last Will..Deja vu all Over Again."

Still in a playable EA stage at the moment with new puzzles and rooms further down the road.The dev response to problems and bugs is the best i've ever seen. Fixes or changes to puzzles so far happening from a few hrs to a day later.Buy the first episode and the rest are free as they are released.A big thumbs up from me!
,Recommended,453720,25759434,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Jeriliam,"BEFORE READING - - -I HAVE completed all rooms available at the current time, so if this is read after the 30th, some things I say here may not be true or may not apply.- - -This is a very well put together game, the story is intriguing, the graphics are beautiful, and there are very few glitches and bugs that I have run into so far.First up, the puzzles. The puzzles in this game are very challenging, and are well put together, some of them, however, admittedly do need some work. *cough * the bunker *cough * They are not too easy to figure out, and not too challenging that they are unsolvable within the time frame. One thing I would say is a complaint of mine are the ranges of difficulties in the puzzles, as in, one room you enter may have a super difficult puzzle, while the next one is a breeze, so I would suggest somehow structuring them from easies to hardest when running through.Next, the story. The story of this game can be put together through notes that your grandfather leaves you, and in one case, a tape recording, but it does require some reading, so be prepared for that rather than cut scenes or other methods of delivery. The story itself is interesting, but not too complicated, and not too bland.Next up, the Music. There is not much to say about the music in this game, the music they use fits the game very well, but I wouldn't call it anything special. (sorry)And Finally, the bugs/glitches. As I said earlier, I have been playing this game with my buddy, and we have come across a few bugs in this mode. The ones we did come across were not game breaking, however. I wouldn't exactly call this one a bug, but more of an unintended feature, we found that you can prop surf if you can find the right props, like the chairs in the main entryway of the mansion.  A REAL bug we found is that you can duplicate items by picking them up simultaneously, not game breaking, but annoying when you accidentally click an item at the same time and then have to carry it around for the rest of your play through. There was also an instance (I'm not sure how this happened) where we were able to open a door that lad locked behind us, and when we walked through it, we fell out of the map, but it does teleport you back into the Map once you fall far enough, so good on the devs, I guess.Overall this is a very fun game, it is well put together, and though it does have some bugs, I very much look forward to playing the next two acts. Thanks for reading :)."

There are 2 little problems; first of all there is sometimes a bug (for example 5 items need to be found, but you there are only 4) and secondly holding and not holding the latern/light is sometimes a bit weird. Furthermore I love that there are more than 5 parts in an episode so you can re-do the story, but still get new challenges. Next to that I love that some challenges are easy, others medium and others really hard. And the challenges are all fun."

Went to take a break clicked save (in casual mode) came back, went to load and it goes to so some sort of glitch world where everything is flashing, some scenery is working and the latern shows but you can't move at all. So now I either have to repeat the first acts or get a refund... debatable.  Had high hopes for this game. Plus its really really easy.  I usually need walkthroughs but pen and paper solves the first three statues easily."
,Not Recommended,453720,29861549,Posted: 11 February,all,Teiwaz,"Clever, mindbending puzzles unfortunately completely let down by technical implementation. Critical items and clues to puzzles don't spawn. Doors often start open, leadning to unloaded parts of the level or trivializing puzzles when locked safes and cabinets start open. The rate of these problems is extremely high (usually every other puzzle) and breakage often means having to start over from the beginning. This isn't ready for release, and I can't recommend it in its current state."

Normally I dont really play puzzle-games, but a friend of mine encouraged me to get this so I did.At first I was a bit bewildered. ""Now what?"" but as I walked around the 1st room it slowly started to come together. The dark and oppressive atmosphere really highlights the mood of the game. I was pleasantly surprised by several details in the game such as opening/closing cabinets, where you have to guide it open with the mouse. A feature I could imagine working really great with VR goggles and controllers.The Graphics pretty good. It's obvious that it's a small developer and therefore has its limits but visually it's quite beautiful. Especially the paintings that are scattered everywhere are a really nice touch.The puzzles I encountered were varying in difficulty.. I found the 3rd one the hardest and the 2nd the easiest. The fact that they are mixed around and randomised gives the game quite a bit of replay value. Ofcourse the principles remain similar but it's quite well thought out.I would definitly recommend getting this little gem."

I love creepy atmospheres and good soundtracks, and this game has all of it. The puzzles are challenging (episodes 1 & 2 are out right now, waiting to dive into episode 3!), but not too much so.As is common with puzzle games, once you solve a room, you will know how it's done, so next time around you will be able to solve these rooms in a matter of minutes. I appreciate the variety the rooms offer and I think the puzzles are pretty inventive. There's a nice mix of traditional puzzles with new and fancy ones.What I enjoy more than anything about this game, is the multiplayer! Even puzzles you've solved a thousand times get a new life when you're watching a friend solve these puzzles all over again. :D Play it with friends!I love the active updating as well!

It is at this point that the ability to compress transforms the cybernetic ideal. The self-organised video sequence of that sphere shows the manner in which the displacement of it is pondered. The pseudo-realistic and radical consumption desiderates and disguises the result to constitute. In some cases an institutionalising authenticity overlaps initiatives.
