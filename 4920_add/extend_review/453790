I have no idea what is going on with this game, but it definitely does not belong on Steam.However,It's functional. And in this day and age on Steam, a game that actually works without breaking itself is a good start. There are quests you can partake in, combat is very much like a bullet-hell shooter if the bullets were able to not only collide into each other, but also remain on the map as movable objects, and you can level up, customise your ""b!tch bullets"" as they were, and fight weird ghost things on the world map.A horrific, functional mess that has no place on Steam.Here's some gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atmxewLfI8o"

It's the type of game you buy knowing from the start it's not going to be great, but the poorly modeled assets, terrible character models, and low budget voice acting come together to make the game slightly charming.  (Like a indie school project gone wrong)- The gameplay just isn't fun at all and is just incredibly basic. After the first hour of gameplay you will find the combat to be incredibly repetitive with essentially no challenge.- The voice acting and background songs seem to mostly be by one guy. It's purposely bad, but after a while it'll just drive you crazy. I ended up skipping through most of the dialogue just because it's pure nonsense and I couldn't stand the voice.- Some parts of the game are just a waste of time as you travel through very long levels and mazes which are mindnumbingly boring."

You look at it and think, ""This looks so bad. Why did they even try?"" and the answer comes back, ""Because I have the inspiration and acumen to make it happen.""Candice is raw folk-art firing on all cylinders. The game feels aggressively earnest and has genuine heart.It's not for everyone, but man is it a hidden gem.This $4.99 glorious train-wreck is 100% landing in my 2017 GOTY list.Simply incredible.Bonus props for the 24-song soundtrack that is currently rocking on my iPhone."

,Recommended,453790,32750244,Posted: 24 June,all,Northern3D,"Candice DeBébé's Incredibly Trick Lifestyleis an absolute marvel of a game.This game, almost does not even deserve the title of a game, I believe a more proper term for this would be an ""experience"".The game's plot is AAA level, rivaling the works of Shakespeare, Stephen King, and the mysteriously anonymous author of the famous fan work,""My Immortal"". Now, I don't want to spoil the story for any potential buyers or art enthusiasts, but I will brush over the first hour or so, as to give you a benchmark of sorts, so you can understand the true potential.You play as Candice DeBébé herself, a noble hero and a magic ♥♥♥♥♥. You go out to get a tan, and an appropriately named ""TanVan"". It is then realized that the TanVan is out of an essential material for the tanning process, and you are asked to enter a forest to get more. Now, you may be wondering why you would find materials you would need for a tan in a forest, and it is perfectly right to think so. But, what happens is the characters acknowledge the outlandishness of such a task, something not many serious stories are willing to do. But what separates the boys from the men of story telling, is that despite the fourth wall being broken, full immersion is kept. At no point at all during my hours of playtime was I pulled away from the plot, and I struggled to even bring myself to stop playing to write this review. But, I cannot go deeper into the plot line, as you will be very much able to discover what Candice DeBébé has in store for you.It runs on the Unity engine, and despite the engine's tropes of having a ""look"" it manages to overcome that and create an art style of it's own, an art style I don't believe has even ever been done before. It's a crisp and vivid art style, popping with colors, bump-maps, and above all, personality. Everything in the game is very smoothly animated, and the models are very detailed, yet minimal- showing only what you need to see and nothing extra. Many lesser games attempt to pull this off, but very few are successful. Candice DeBébé is an artistic masterpiece of design and execution. I especially love the depth of field effect the game has, I feel it is a subtle reminder that no matter how big the story is, we do live in a small world after all.The gameplay is fantastic fun, and kept me excited and on the edge of my seat whenever I was in either a tense moment of risk during a boss fight, or casually fighting a grunt such as a beetle or a sexy ghost. the gameplay is deceivingly simple, and although it may seem that you just click in the direction you want to shoot at, it's more complex than that. You see, the pellets you shoot at them are actually influenced by physics, and can be moved around on your own just by walking into them. This extraordinarily unique gameplay mechanic raises the skill ceiling to nearly unreachable levels, as there's no telling what ways this can be manipulated to your advantage. Any foe who shoots pellets back at you, also has their pellets affected by physics. This means that with your own pellets, you can both attack and defend yourself. When I came to realize this, I was blown away. This raises the skill ceiling, that was already incredibly high, to nearly infinite levels that even gods could not reach. I encourage you to tryCandice DeBébé's Incredibly Trick Lifestyle's Incredibly Trick Gameplay.The soundtrack is godly, with twenty-four original tracks, most of if not all of them containing original lyrics sung by Candice DeBébé herself. I found this to add a deeper sense of emotion, and when I was listening to the ""Lady Garden"" song, I was nearly brought to tears. It's a song of love, with a hint of homosexuality. I believe the homosexual underlying tone of the lyrics add a depth of emotion I couldn't even fathom a game could bring to me. I feel that this song is Candice's love song, a song that shows that love is truly love, even through anything that fights it. If this alone won't bring you to your knees crying, It's accompanied by a masterful piano track, that adds so much more emotion to this song. And this is just one song of twenty-four, and I can leave you to experience it on your own.In every single department, from every angle and all perspectives, I give this game a perfect10/10(Tan out of Ten).This game is a must-buy for anyone that dares call themselves a gamer. Because if you've never playedCandice DeBébé's Incredibly Trick Lifestyle, you haven't played a game yet. If you don't have the money, even for this game's incredibly humble pricepoint, I recommend you earn it as soon as possible by any means possible, even if it means holding off your daily spray tan for a week or so. What's a week of work? A month? For Candice DeBébé, it's nothing at all. It's worth it."

It's a game that at first glance looks like a poorly made rushed project that was hastily put on Steam to try to make a quick buck, but it actually had a lot of work put into it, despite it's shoddy appearance. It's a silly yet charming game, and if you're into silly joke games like I am, I say you should check it out. A few words of advice though on some improvements that could be made:1. Add a run function so Candice can move a bit faster.2. Add a map for Digital Hex or at least make it a bit easier to navigate. That was probably one of the most tedious parts that i came across and can be off putting since it's pretty early in the game.3. Invest in a pop shield for your microphone.4. There's a ""bug"" where you can use the boat to climb over the guard and get on the Lusty Mermaid before completing the necessary steps which should probably be fixed.5. The price is a bit high to be honest, and I would definitely recommend the game 100% if it was at a lower price, but I'm not sure how much power the creator has over setting the price.Overall, although it may look like Steam shovelware at first glance, the game is much more than that. It's not just an asset flip. It has original models, an original plot, and a soundtrack that although the singing may be not top notch, the music itself is actually well composed and the pianist definitely knows their way around a piano. Is it stupid? Yes. Should it be on Steam? Probably not. But for all its ridiculousness its amusing and you can't help but have at least a little bit of respect for the developer putting the amount of effort they did into this wacky RPG. I recommend this game if you are into silly joke games as this one has a lot of charm."

There are scenes where the aforementioned Derby man plays four different female characters and in effect is having a conversation with himself in varying degrees of falsetto. There is a serious risk that you may lose your sanity as a result of exposure to this. I was able to survive by punching myself in the testes until I passed out but it was a close call.The explosive final entry in the acclaimed Candice DeBébé trilogy didn't disappoint, except on one count. As a diehard fan of the series, I am enraged that the continuity of the series has been rebooted. After Candice triumphantly battled to obtain a council house she has now inexplicably found herself in a trailer park, which I can only attribute to attempting to break the American market. At what cost, havishamone games? For shame. Spit in the faces of your most loyal fans and casually widdle all over the legacy of Candice DeBébé why don't you? This is just like the Mass Effect 3 ending all over again.A word on the soundtrack - an OST, no less! Every area has been thematically designed with a real intricacy and as such you will really appreciate how much you hate every new song you encounter. It doesn't matter though, when it hits its third or fourth loop it's already too late. You will be merrily singing along to every song and won't notice that your surroundings have somehow morphed into the ninth circle of Hell.I can't decide whether it's gaming's Citizen Kane or gaming's The Room."
