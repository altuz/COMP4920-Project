Combined with the fact that at this level enemy releases ~10 heroes to every one of yours and it stops being difficult and just hits impossible. Requested refund and advise everyone to avoid game like the plague I absolutely expected it to be when I saw that it was a ""we took a free flash game and put it on steam for money"" game."
,Not Recommended,453820,22517550,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,AvenDoram,"Seriously. What is this game? When I read reviews and people said it got to hard I assumed it was like Kingdom Rush. Where it becomes harder but still possible. But no... Before even having all the content unlocked I was stuck. I was stuck on level 3. The enemy spams troops faster than you. And they have troop types you don't even have yet. They spam the fire magic just to rain down letting your troops get slaughtered. While they rush your castle. So I thought, ""Oh... I guess I might need to grind on older levels? I mean Epic War 4 and 5 you have to do that but I still love those games and I would get a steam game of it if they had one. But no. I completed an older level and was rewarded with NOTHING. No gold. No blue... things?... expirence points? So pretty much they want me to get really lucky against the level three, the first tutorial level to magic! I don't normally refund games especially cheap ones like this. But this game is so horrible I don't want it in my library. I don't want to look at it. I don't think I'll have any occasional fun with it. Honestly you guys would be better off throwing 100 pennies in a fountain and get more fun and time then you would at this game. It is really that bad."

If you use your warriors you lose.  then you can upgrade one of your unitslevel 3 you get a spell.  If you upgraded *or* use your archers you lose.this is *not* good game design.  Later on in the game you get multiple spells.  sometimes you can't use a spell, but the game never tells you what causes this (is it a glitch?), it appears to *mostly* be that you can't cast the same spell twice in a row, but sometimes a spell stays disabled for 2 casts after you cast it.  None of this is terribly bothersome.  what is bothersome is that it doesn't *tell* you that you can't cast the spell.  it just does nothing when you click the button.furthermore.  It's supposed to be a units based game, but anything other than the ""slow tanky warrior type"" pretty much just gets obliterated by enemy spells immediately, so the only viable strategy I could find is spam tanks, continuously trade units with spells, and *very* slowly widdle down the enemy base.  Not a fun game"

,Not Recommended,453820,25312601,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,prositen,"Wow, this was pretty horrible. The other negative reviews are spot on: the game is not balanced at all - okay, I made it to level 8 before giving up, but that was only through spamming the warrior - and yes, the UI does indeed disappear every now and then.It's been quite a lot more than two weeks since I bought this game, so I'll do the second best thing after getting a refund: Getting cards and selling them."
,Not Recommended,453820,32645672,Posted: 22 June,all,KidwithSmurf,"When I first saw this game, I thought given the game description and the fact I enjoy small games of this style, I thought if executed well for a dollar it’d be a fun little game. However, I was quickly disappointed to find out that it wasn’t executed well and here’s why:Pros:♦ Game Launches (What can I say it launches which is something)♦ Has Steam Trading Cards (Every game should make use of Steam Features)♦ Controls work (Let’s face it, the only way to control the game is with the mouse… it’d be hard to get that wrong)Cons:♦ Graphic glitches (The graphics for whatever reason just look blurry, not entirely sure why this is)♦ Game crashes (Randomly the game will crash to desktop and you’ll have to re-open it)♦ UI disappearing (Playing through the third level, the UI will randomly disappear, this will mean you can’t click to spawn your units or see either the enemies or your own tower health)♦ Enemy units spawn in way faster than yours (In the third level it can glitch and numerous enemy archers can spawn in at once and wreck you)♦ Difficulty balancing (The game is unbalanced as the first two levels are really easy and the third is a struggle if not impossible to win)♦ Sound speed up loop bug (By this I mean you can be playing and all of a sudden the sound will speed up and just loop really, really fast and annoyingly to the point where you have to mute the game or close it)♦ No options menu (The game doesn’t really need one but it would be nice to have sound sliders, and basic resolution and graphic settings)♦ No replayability (I say this as once you beat a level you can go back and do it again, however you won’t get rewarded for it or anything making it not worth replaying)♦ No coins or gems for replaying a level (When you beat a level you get coins and gems to upgrade your units, however when you replay a level you get nothing. This is annoying as I found level 3 almost, if not, impossible to beat. Therefore, I thought I could replay other levels and farm to level up my units faster and make things easier… but you can’t)♦ No Steam Achievements (This is annoying as there is no real point being on Steam without making use of Steam Achievements)♦ Expensive and won’t get your monies worth in play time (For $1 it’s very expensive considering I couldn’t get past the third level)♦ Feels like a poorly made free flash game or mobile game (Nothing other than the Steam Trading Cards makes this feel like it should be on Steam)♦ Enemy spells seem overpowered (Enemy spells seem to one hit kill almost any unit no matter what upgrade they are whilst yours don't. This further makes the difficulty of the game really unbalanced as mentioned)Overall, due to the game having way more cons than pros, being very expensive due to being virtually unplayable because of game breaking bugs and the fact it feels like the Developers never even tested the game means I cannot recommend this at any price, even on sale.PS: Any game time over 10 minutes is card farming."
,Not Recommended,453820,26373032,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,Ayuri,"Hero Quest : Tower Conflict reminds me of Age of War : two sides battling with different upgradable units and spells to unleash on your opponents or to heal your army.To be fair, the game is cheap and has some short term entertainment potential. However, I can't recommend it because of the lack of options and the existing bugs : the interaction bar goes missing for no reason, so that you can't deploy more units or cast spells, and the game keeps randomly crashing (in my case, once every ~15 minutes).Good idea and effort, but somehow the game doesn't seem quite finished."

Animations are barebones. 2D sprites clip into each other. Cooldows insufficient to beat levels by level 3. Game is just clicking on cooldowns when they are ready while 2D flash game characters swing at each other between two castles with hope of killing enemy castle. Sound loops constantly. Cheap sound effects. Translation is broken english but not in a funny way, just in an incompetent way."

76561198065396619,Not Recommended,453820,22595760,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,Violent Rainbow,"I really hate to leave a bad review for a game especially one with so much potential but this is the most ridiculously difficult game I've ever played! Basically what you do is press buttons that spawn warriors that protect your castle while attacking the enemy castle on the opposite side and you also have spells that damage the enemy however the buttons take time before you can press them again and the enemies are coming at you the whole time and they also have spells that kill your troops pretty much as soon as they're spawned, no matter how hard you try it's almost impossible to hold them off and there's nothing you can really do to make it easier other than upgrades that don't seem to do anything since each level increases dramatically in difficulty anyway. I would have really enjoyed this game if it weren't so impossible."

,Not Recommended,453820,29786262,Posted: 8 February,all,Goat Master,"I don't remember how I got this, but I know it wasn't free. So, the main things I don't like are this:The images are a rather low resolution, meaning playing in fullscreen looks pretty shoddy. Kinda like a flash game.The music is very repetitive and compressed, as are the sounds. Kinda like a flash game.The gameplay is very basic and repetitive, with the minimal programming needed to progress an action. Which, along with minimal programming, there are times when a spell won't work, or when you actually cannot summon any more fighters, and then lose the game because it is broken. Kinda like a lot of flash games.Oh wait, it runs in Adobe Flash Player. It is a flash game.That being said, even if it is cheap, it's not really worth the money. There are a lot of games you can play with similar or even better quality on your mobile or in your browser for free. I appreciate the effort that one or two people probably put in to this, but it's just not up to par for Steam. I think this developer has a good heart, but there's always room for improvement."
,Not Recommended,453820,24697741,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Miss_Fangirly,"Original review -Okay, so I will admit I love this game. It's great! But the bugs make it mostly unplayable. I'm in the last stage of the third region out of four, and I get to the end and I can't press any buttons to attack or defend myself or the interface just disappears. That's not even mentioning that during the match every so often a button will become un-clickable. I'm still going to keep trying because I still have hope one day it might work. But I can't recommend because most likely it's not going to work.Updated review –Game Title: Hero Quest: Tower ConflictAchievement Progress (at the time of post): None (There are no achievements)(My reviews assume you have read about the content of the game in terms of gameplay. I am simply reviewing each individual aspect based on my opinion. This allows for my reviews to be spoiler-free. You may find I rate by different categories in each of my reviews. This is because every type of game is different, and will not have the same content. I think it is pointless to leave a category blank or write 'unrelated', or something similar.)Game Content:Type of Game:Tower defense, strategyGraphics and Art Style:**** - The game is beautiful in a childish way and the characters that set out to defend your tower and the opposing tower are creatively designed.Music:* - Endless repeat of the same song (mostly), the song isn’t that bad, but it gets old.Addictiveness and Difficulty:** - In the later levels (although some people even get stuck at the third level) it gets stupidly difficult, some would even say impossible. (I found a good strategy, so this didn’t happen for me, but it happens to many others.) This level of difficulty is often frustrating for players, causing them to not enjoy it.Gameplay and Controls:** - Gameplay is limited to clicking buttons on a bar at the bottom of the screen with your mouse. Not particularly interesting and can get a little boring, as you are usually repeatedly pressing the same button after the cooldown is finished, waiting for the cooldown, then pressing once again.Game Functionality:* - THERE ARE MANY BUGS. I enjoyed what I (managed) to play, but after a while some buttons become unclickable or the button interface disappears, resulting in your timely defeat. This is the most frustrating part for anyone I would imagine, and was ultimately the issue that led to me stopping playing, after only three hours.Conclusion:Marks Overall (judged by the mode of the numbers):*/** 3/10Who Should Play This Game?:I would not recommend wasting your time on this game, although if you are a masochist who enjoys pointless frustration, go ahead.Thank you for reading! If you have any suggestions about removing/adding/changing anything in my reviews, please let me know.Peace out mein liebes XD-Kaz D"
