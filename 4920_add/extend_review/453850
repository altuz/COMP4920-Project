I enjoy the piano music in the background and the attention to detail in each frame.HOWEVER:I was very interested in this game because of the plot. It seemed mysterious and alluring. This is not the case. In the first 5 seconds everything is revealed to you. (The bad guy is actually named ""Murderer"" not exactly mysterious.)Also, some play-throughs of the game take 20 seconds. No, this is not an exaggeration, 20 seconds from start to finish. There is no interaction with items in the back drops that can extend the gameplay even marginally. I was given two-three 'choices' in each play-through (I've completed 4 so far) and they each led to a swift ending.I am truly hoping that this is just the alpha version of the game and that more content is to come. However, as the game stands, it seems unfinished and brief with clunky dialogue and unfinished plotlines."

This game isn't the worst thing ever but boy, is it bad. I played through the game about 7 times trying to see if I could understand what on earth the story behind everything was but I couldn't. And according to the description of this game, ""Each of your choices will lead to a different result.""This is a bold-faced lie.You can say either tell the truth or lie in certain situations and all it'll get you is maybe a bit of extra dialogue--you'll get the same ending. I may also add that my fastest run of this game took me not thirty minutes, not ten minutes, not even FIVE minutes. It took me a solid minute or less to get to some of these endings. There's virtually no objects with which to interact in order to trigger something, and those that do it'll just lead you straight to an ending. The game keeps trying to draw you in with, ""Well, Red's father and the murderer knew each other!"" and ""oh well there's more to it than meets the eye~! hurrhurrhurr"" but if there is then the game should have A. Been much longer, B. Not just ended after you make a choice not even thirty seconds into the game, and C. NOT BEEN RELEASED. I mean, honestly, if this game was just something someone made to practice different endings in RPG maker, then I would understand! But it's not; this is an actual game that someone is selling and that I paid money for. I hope to god that this is just some kind of early release and that the game will have more content and updates in the future, but something tells me that aint going to happen.Overall: don't buy this game unless there's been some kind of huge update."
,Not Recommended,453850,24134147,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Dandys,It looks nicely done and the story do seem interesting. Yet I took 10 second (this is NO JOKE) to get my first ending. And yes I red everything. No skipping.The other endings are as easy to gain as the first one and the story is rather confusing. You have to play it several times to understand even a little what's going on. In my first run (the 10 seconds) I didn't even understood in the slightest what was going on.

The game automatically saves for you and when you complete an ending, it goes back to the last save point. The story isn't great. Neither is the soundtrack. You can beat the game easily within an hour with 100% achievements. Grab it on sale or save your money. I don't recommend it."
76561197995669628,Recommended,453850,28194381,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Sorokonojka,"Dear Red is a 3-minute long RPG-maker drama that has around 17 endings some of which are abrupt deaths.I see a lot of reviews focusing on the length of the game but I think the developer was just going for unique story format. The plot is basically cut into many pieces and spread through those endings.You can 100% the game with all achievements in under 1 hour which is a little short. I think most people expect 3-4 hours of content with similar games.Honestly, I like the format of the game but there was just not enough time to invest yourself into characters. You also have a freedom of doing any ending right away which does not give the game a chance to build any suspense. Maybe if true ending required other endings to unlock it would make more sense. Otherwise, you may figure out the plot before you pick up the clues.The game takes place in just 3 rooms so gameplay is all about figuring out how to actually trigger those 17 endings which usually involves text choices or timing.It is not a traditional RPG maker game because there isn't much gameplay or puzzles in between choices that you make.It is more of a sudden death game where you restart until you pick the right one.One of the characters is literally referred to as Murderer so few people complained that plot was given away. Without giving any spoilers I'll just say that story is deeper than that. I mean it was not very satisfying just because it was short but it seemed original at the very least.Music is pretty good but I don't think it fits the game that well. It's not much of a horror game but it seems a bit too happy for the drama that happens. Sound effects were on point though.I like pixel art but I am not sure how much of it is present in RPG maker. There were some decent animations but I wish every ending had one. Instead most ending just end abruptly in a game over screen.Verdict 6/10. Dear Red has some neat ideas when it comes to restarting story format but everything happens too fast. Instead of a lengthy game, you have to play a short one over and over to get the full picture. I don't really have a problem with this game in general but it does not give itself enough time to make an impactful impression."

,Not Recommended,453850,29596431,Posted: 30 January,all,Hawk Zombie,"Got it on sale, but returned it. I was able to get 100% achievements in that time as well...there were some concepts I actually enjoyed, such as getting a .txt file in the game's directory for each ending you unlocked. It was a neat touch, but ended up being just confusing, and one file didn't even have anything written in it.While I kinda liked the story, it was too short and never really explained anything until the very end, and then just makes you out to be, well, the crazy bad guy.I hope the developer continues to make games, and improves on the ideas here, but as it sits, it's just an on the rails 'make a choice' dialog game that is too short to justify the price."

,Recommended,453850,22431655,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Subliminal Smile,"This game has some really great potential, though it could definitely use some polishing. More than anything else, the game would greatly benefit from some fleshing-out of the characters and backstory. I like how the story is revealed in small pieces, but the pieces don't add up to much of a coherent story in total. I enjoyed the character of Red very much, she was a strong if not slightly psychotic protagonist- but it would be nice to have learned more about her. Perhaps if there were more interactive objects within the game, it would lend a little more to giving you a better idea of her inner thoughts and personality.I love the concept of ""truth/lies"" and the multitude of ways to get to various endings to the game; though some can be called more of a simple ""game over"" rather than an actual ending. It was fun to see how many different ways the game could actually end, especially when more elements of the story are introduced. I wish the endings had more of an impact, though, maybe with a cut-scene or more voicework of some kind, or at the very least some kind of title given at the end to differentiate them.I hope that the developer will consider fleshing out the game a bit more, but if not, this is a fine first effort in my opinion."

(And I am one of the people who, after having to repeat multiple choices, skipped the dialoge)However I do see some people have around 3 hours worth of playtime.I'm not actually sure how that works but moving on.This game is not one for someone looking for HOURS worth of playtime and an amazing story.This game is for someone who wants something to kill time withNice musicInteresting story (though this is very debatable)But a short playtime and not having to invest in an entire story.I must admit the price is slightly high for a game of such short playtime but that is a developers choice.Overall I personally would be thrilled if the developers decided to add more endings.Maybe if the playtime went up this game would have much better reviews like it desereves.6/10Most people would find that bad but that is my overall opinion, trying not to be too biased by my own interests.Anything over 5 is good and recommended.Anyone want a game to kill some time with that has a nice story and good soundtrack? Right here.Anyone want a game with a lengthy story and hours worth of playtime? Go find something else, this is not right for you.Simple as that."

,Not Recommended,453850,22407061,"Posted: 14 April, 2016",all,ktr0x,"Ok, so I bought this game because I love beautiful games with deep storylines. This game, at first was giving me some pretty nice thoughts about a medium sized indie truth or lie game. But the truth is that the game lacks content. It starts and you can finish the first ending in 15 seconds, and I did... This 'Extended' game makes me think what the normal version will be like. Will it have even less content? Will you be able to finish an ending in 5 seconds? I'm very disappointed. I don't have many nice things to say about this game other than it needing to be in for beta testing or get some freelancers to review the game before its release.StoryThe story was fairly clearYou are a girl named Red, a man named murderer kills your mother and murderer has a sick daughterIt was a nice story for this type of game but it didn't give too much of Red's backstory. But the man being called murderer... Why not call him Bob, Bill or Jeff. Why give away all the fun of wondering who the murder is and maybe a twist being hidden in the story?SoundThis game's sounds didn't feel sad at the sad parts and a bit of music when Red is outside the house would've been nice.GraphicsThis game had some fairly nice Pokemon style graphics and fit right into the theme. The graphics were possibly the best part of the game. Except the part where you start teleporting around the house. Red is obviously not God so maybe Red can just follow murderer around the house so it's more natural.ReplayingOk, this game is hard to replay to try to get the different endings. There are no achievements, so no end goal. It would be nice to have achievements and have a better ending every time instead ofStabbing murdererand giving no real value towards replaying it, making people bored after they play through once.ControlsThe controlsneedto improve. It took me 6 minutes to find out I was supposed to use the arrow keys instead of the mouse. Being able to interact in the menu with the mouse would be a nice feature. But after the menu, the controls are nice and simple.OptionsNo options. No fullscreen. No resolution. No steam overlay. And many more options that are non-existent. I believeEVERYgame needs options. Even if it is just fullscreen/windowed or controls or something. Also, an option to skip the intro for those people who don't like stories (I know a guy).Final CommentThe game has so much potential and if I was the developer I would be making this an early access game so people know I will spend more than two hours on it. The game is way too short which has made people stop playing after 5 minutes. The storyline also has a possibility to be deeper and maybe we could learn more about the sick daughter by talking to her? Lastly, I rate...3/10The game has lots to offer and the developer will hopefully continue working on this game to make it better and longer. I did enjoy the game for the few minutes I played it but it really needs more content and I would love to see some improvements :)"
,Not Recommended,453850,22490532,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,[VII],"While interesting, this game is really not worth the price. Even if you really don't mind the few dollars it takes to purchase it, I wouldn't recommend it. I myself regretted the purchase after a multitude of short, only fleetingly interactive endings. It took 32 minutes for me to get all of them. The story is not presented in a way that is understandable, and while I can appreciate abstract stories and endings, this game truly just seems poorly done. If it was free, I'd say it would be worth it to kill a bit of boredom. Since it's not, I'd just head for games that are a lot better and often lower in price or even free. Like others recommend, you could even just check out vgperson translated JRPG horror games."

There are a lot of games out there, even rpg maker games, that give you more than your money's worth, even if you only payed a dollar.  THis is not one of those games.  There's some seriously incomplete writing here, with plot points merely hinted at but never actually revealed.  The fact of it is, you could get the full ""extended"" experience watching someone spend 30 seconds playing it on youtube.  Since each ending can take you less than a minute to achieve, and lacks any satisfaction as an ending, this game is not worth your money, much less your time."
