76561197970712242,Recommended,453960,25530500,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,ithaqua,"This is really a fantastic little game. It's essentially a board game with RTS elements. It's slow moving and thoughtful. I thought it was very much like FTL, in a good way.It's a game I will keep coming back to, and I hope the devs continue to sopport it as it's fun and addictive.In order to fully enjoy the game you must appreciate the stories of how your survivors end up dying, because they will die.The RTS is so far the weakest element and needs work, there seem to be some exopected features missing, like hot keys and group select.The art in the game has a nice style and I appreciate the thought that went into details like the camp locations. Many games would have just used the same graphics, but this really makes it feel as if one is moving from place to place.It also grows the more you play it, as the skills you unlock by going from major area to major area stay on subsequent play throughs, so the more you play, the more the game opens up as far as character abuilities and crafting go. If you play this once and give up, you will never see what the game really is. And what it is is fun.If you like board games, then I have no problem strongly recoomending this game, even at it's current level of completion I am enjoying the hell out of it.This game was a very pleseant and very inexpensive surprise."

It reminds me of This War is mine, sort of, in that you have to manage a group of survivors, keep them fed, stocked up on ammo, send scouts, and move out to expand territory.I have only have a play around with it, but here is the first 20 minutes of gameplay for those that would find this helpful.https://youtu.be/JPq69zsZrtg"

You need to assemble the right gang or you're toast. There is a decent amount of things to do like crafting defenses and weapons, learn skills, upgrade your characters, provide them with armor... Also, even when there are no missions, most locations give you choices like fighting, running away, accept new people or kill new people, let someone starve or kicking him or her to the curve, etc. Is a little game but with some deep. Takes ya several attempts to get it right. Is challenging but not unfair. No bugs. Is usually pretty cheap and there are cards and achievements. I think is a great deal and something I gladly recommend."

,Not Recommended,453960,31067801,Posted: 10 April,all,MAriskaDeville,"https://youtu.be/7zmrSFdP-rgSo the game is cheap, and props to the developer he has tried to give some replay value by adding game modes and perks etc that are lcoked until you play through the game a few time. Graphically its not terrible, and the sounds are fairly sparse but what is there does a decent enough job. Also the rogue like elements are pretty appealing.However I still find it hard to give this game a positive review thanks to the balance issues and poor combat that plague the experience as a whole. Combat is very clunky and selecting team members in the heat of battle  can be incredibly frustrating.You can also build traps, barriers and weapons to help but again the balance issues hurt the game. The cost of most items you can build means you will never have enough resources to actually build many of them. Also some of them are so useless when you do build them you have just wasted valuable resources.I found the overall experience just too frustrating to say I was having fun. For a bit more polish and balance this could have been a damn fine game."
,Recommended,453960,22637837,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,Dauen,"So the game is in earlllllly stages, but it shows promise. I think it's going to be a lot of fun when it is completely finished. Right now, I can only recommend it to anyone who is okay with playing games while in their ""testing"" stage - you'll encounter bugs and crashes, but get a good idea of where the concept is going.The game is set up kind of like a board game. You travel location to location through the city, when entering a new location, you have the option to send nobody to everybody out to scavenge for supplies, new locations, and new survivors. You can also craft barricades and makeshift explosives for when you engage in a fight.While out scavenging, it is possible for a survivor to get injured (just letting you know it's not a freethrow).You'll have to fight people and zombies alike in order to survive and maintain enough amenities to survive. While some of the fights are simulated, upon entering a regular fight, you have to strategically set your survivors position in order to neutralize the oncoming threat. If one of your comrades dies in battle, they and their supplies are gone.Some of the aforementioned glitches:-Rescued a survivor, prompted with ""New survivor joined the group"", no new survivor joined.-While in a normal fight, my stamina was full and my survivors would not attack. Leading to many of their deaths.-When traveling to a new location, said location doesn't load and you are met with a solid black screen, ending your progress. Just for fun, I button-mashed my keyboard to see what would happen and was taken back to the main menu. However, my only option was still to start a new game.So like I said, definitely potential here, excited to see the final product! Thank you, Kazakov Oleg for supporting the indie horror community!"
,Recommended,453960,27619511,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,Bruudwin,"could be so much better. lotsa potential though.   you know this genre\type of zombie game.Escape the city with so n such people.  random \ selectedstart off one end of city, go to other end.  along the way you scout, scavenge, learn skills etc.lotsa random events as you progress.I don't get why the last screen shot in the steam store page of this product shows a nice grid like set up. as the game is nothing like that at all. its RTS in battle mode.RTS mode is funky.  can't quick camera to anybody (double tapping their icon etc)  but at the least it lets you select them no matter where they are, to move within your current camera field of viewanother thing about RTS,  the baricade \ trap system is also weird.  little to no boundary per baricade, trap set down.  so you could almost stack as many walls \ traps on a single area.Walls, depending how you put down baricades, they will be slightly overlapping one another so that you don't have any gaps.  despite this sometimes a zombie will push through despite my baricades 'overlapping'  and will get at the guys behind.also error\bug i've noticed.  At the end of a battle, if you had people healing each other before the last enemy is killed. they will continue to heal target ally for 100% hp  as long as you don't accept the battle results.suggestion for dev.   battling no matter what difficulty tends to be short n sweet.  makes it very hard to attempt to salvage \ search throughout the battle.    Perhaps make it so that if you didn't search everywhere during the battle you only get a small fraction \ % of it (excuse is such n such got broken while fighting)  whereas you'd get the 100% whatever if you had people searching\looting during battle.for Night time, allow flashlights \ fires or something to be crafted. fires could be used for torches \ traps too!for leveling up stats.  if you say 'putting a point in this statistic raises damage output of melee... gun etc'  then let it be reflected when you equip weapons on them!  i don't want to see a guy with 10 stats on gun and see the same starting pistol still does ""2.0 damage"" !!!be nice to resize the UI  since after getting 4+ survivors their icons start to take up the left side of my screen.You cannot organize the people in anyway.  so you get them in whatever random order you save them \ they join you \ start the game off with.  i would love to have reorder the people so that all my melee people be the first numbers of the group then shooters etc...If you have a guy with a shield equipped. and for some reason click on another shield. you suddenly lose a shield :(  had 2 shields. lost one that way.and when people die. you don't get to recover the things on them. or cannabalize. that would be a neat idea.

76561197988212260,Recommended,453960,28396206,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,WarlordJim,What a great little find this game is. I managed to pick it up for just 50cYou play as a group of survivors during a zombie outbreak and have to scavenge for supplies whilst keeping your group fed and trained so they can get to the exit of each map.The idea is solid and addictive as hell. It plays a bit like a board game which is great.Sure there's a bit of bad broken english (which i think adds to the charm) and I’mstill not 100% sure how to manage the resources properly or how exactly collecting more works to be able to do it effectively and the combat system seems a little unbalanced (but I guess it would be during a zombie apocalypse). But i just can’t stop playing.The creator of this game has stated that FTL was a big influence  however having never played FTL i can't compare it.Hope they port it to IOS or Android as this would be a great game to play mobile whilst waiting for a train.Interested to see what any updates bring.
76561197996972957,Not Recommended,453960,28062637,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,sir Evans,"TL:DR;This game is not what it appears to be on a first glance. I cannot recommend it without few conditions and without explaining what it really is - read on!Review:Envy the Dead might appear at first glance as tactical combat mixed with survival in post-apocalyptic world.In reality this is more of a board game, where you move your pawns around and make decisions every day.Combat sucks. Random events are usually combat related, so they suck a bit as well.Graphics as on screenshots is somewhat of a lie - it's not bad, but not really that great either.There is virtually no tutorial in the game, except of few explanation screens.If you are into post-apocalyptic zombie survival board games, this might be it for you.There are however few things about the rules that you need to know to play it succesfully.Rules:- scouting ends the day. Set your toons to training/scavenging before scouting.- you can only train skills when you use them or if character has proper equipment. If you toon carries rifle, he will not train melee fighting.- in stage 3 you will not be able to recruit anyone. make sure full party makes it to level 3 or you will suffer- melee weapons become useless very fast, but ammo is very limited. avoid fights whenever you can- barricades and traps won't work against non-zombie oponnents or bosses. use flammable oil barrels instead.- skills are being unlocked during a playthrough and this is global. your first playthrough will only let you unlock skills it's the second where it starts getting serious.If you are in that type of the games or a great fan of a genre, go ahead and grab it - you will enjoy it for a dozen or so hours, but just don't expect too much."

Gameplay is a mix between party management,  exploration \ rouge lite \ survival ,  and a quite good  real time tactical combat game.  Graphics are very good for a budget game.  Has a social system which is interesting but not really fleshed out yet.Been playing for 4 hours and not seen any major bugs yet,  just a few glitches.UI still needs a lot of polish though, and there's bad English in places. If  you're not bothered by such flaws, this can be a very additive and atmospheric game at a ridiculously low price."

It's still an early access and it definitely shows in some places, but the dev is still releasing updates, so I can only assume it will get better with age"
,Not Recommended,453960,31311990,Posted: 22 April,all,Liquid.Dendi,"(First Impression)This game got a very potential to be a great android game, i guess its more suited as android game rather than PC game.Its a time click-and-recheck later game.But if its im plemented on PC game, that needs to run onscreen all the time to make a progress, while all we gotta saw is a static screen, with only  some progress bar's for item collecting status and  3 main interaction button with dead animation behind it, it rather frustating and stupid.It'll make more sense if we just do some stuff a bit check it one time , then after we cant make a move ( because our character is badly injured, and theres no medicine left )   , we just let them stay safe and assign em to search stuff without us having to keeping the screen and the game running and wait for some hours for them complete the searching.THATS why this game more suitable on android platform, so we can close it  and still  get notification if our player is hungry or if the items are collected without us having open the game all the time.The game concept is quite enjoyable really, the game zombies or humans encounter battle is good , but need more tweaks and rework, and in the next updates add some animation if the character taking behind some cover is a very good  addition .At the current state, this game is still a mess. Devs might wanna consider adding some PC gameplay into the game to make the game relatable for a PC.  Because all i see is Android game material .RATE: 2.5 / 5 stars"

BUT...There are alot of problems with the game. when you are in a fight it is really hard to get your team to do what you want. at one point i had 5 members of my team against 1 foe and we lost. this was because the commands didnt work and they stood still. When this happens you can save yourself by pressing ESC and then going back into the game but by doing this you lose everything you had in your invo for example, walls, barrels, tank etc. IT IS A PAIN!!!...Another problem i have had is you can on to the exit zones and click ""not now"" so you will be on that spot but wont leave just yet... this is great if you change your mind but if you do this on both exits... your never getting out because it dosent think you ever want to leave. you might as well kill yourself and start again.Would i recommend the game... i would say no. i have played over 7 hours and i have to start again because of the above problems. not a good way to spend your weekend."

,Recommended,453960,30892600,Posted: 1 April,all,✪ nyx,"I know that this seems like a bad review.""Why do you only have .2 hours on record?!""The answer is becasue I really don't know whats going on in the game.For the past year or so, over a couple of steam accounts, I've been accumulating little & cheap indie games that have caught my eye from the Steam store. This was on sale for around 50 cents when I bought it, so I figured I'd give it a spin.The Big Picture:You are a group of survivors in a Zombie Apocalypse looking to strive in the harsh conditions. You need to manage your food, ammunition, and scrap (I'll get to this later), and your shelter.Mechanics:Crafting - Very simple but gets the job done. Scrap is the main building supply, but in order to build things you also need ""hammer points"" (for lack of a better phrase), which I assume comes from each turn you've been through.Scouting - Have you ever played Bethesda's Fallout Shelter? Well, the scouting is basically the scavenging in that game sped up to around 3-4 seconds. You pick a character to scout (scavenge) and equip the desired weapons and equipment, then send them off to the wastes. They come back in a few seconds with some supplies and maybe some currency. Overall a good system.Leveling/Skill Trees - This game's leveling is so very simple yet perfect for the purpose of a lightweight mechanic. You have a variety of available skills you can choose upon leveling up (in which your character glows yellow until you pick skills), and have four max at any given time. Some of these skills are class beneficial, where others are more universal. It adds the aspect of the importance of management, because you have to spend your points wisely.Traveling/Moving Settlement - Very simple. Ties into scouting in which new locations are found, and then are available to inhabit. Not sure of the importance of certain settlements, but this review will be updated eventually*.All other Mechanics - I haven't made it very far, but all of the mechanics that I've seen and messed with seem to work quite well.Pros and Cons:Pros:-Cheap & Goes on sale often-Good Developers & Updated often-Decent Graphics-Fun & Casual (Not much effort is needed in Normal mode(Not sure if that is supposed to be, but whatever,))-Overall Good Game so farCons:-Bit confusing (Maybe update Tutorial???)-Menu Text sometimes goes over borders-Resolution is default set to 4k (Maybe just me)-Options are limited-Characters are sometimes cutoff by screen-Crafting menu isn't compatible with scroll wheel-+ A lot more simple and not that bad things that don't really need to be mentioned.Summary:If you have some leftover money in your Steam wallet then this game is quite the deal, for .99USD full price and common sales, it's a downright bargain. It is a very good and from what I know an original idea, with no major bugs that make the game unplayable. The bugs that do occur often only effect the asthetics and resolution rather then any gameplay mechanics. It's an overall good game, and even though it might have some bugs here and there, and maybe some confusing bits to it, it really has room for improvement.+rep for not copy-pasting more Unity assets onto Steam.P.S. Please feel free to comment any revisions for this review if you feel they are needed.*I'm quite a lazy person so don't expect anything too soon if something does change."
