Pretty much these two guys wanna kill each other and the world sucks for some reason.""This game is unlike any other game I have played, and is easily one of my most memorable experiences in gaming.The gameplay is butt-bustingly hard yet fair, the graphics are well-crafted, the music is superb and there's plenty of content in the game to keep you playing for a while. It's a shame how obscure it is, and that's why I've been telling friends about it. Ryan Melmoth has made a truly wonderful (and very weird) game here, and it deserves far more recognition.There are a couple of flaws, such as not having a pause button/menu, no volume controls and no controller support, but they're very easy to overlook.I easily give this game a 9/10, and hope to see more great games from the developer!"

And while the Megaman Legacy Collection does a good job of recreating the ""literal"" games that they are, it cannot evoke the ball busting difficulty that i remember of playing Megaman 5 as a child for the first time (pro tip: MM5 is easy as sin as an adult)I think that games like Mibibli capture the true nostalgia of being helplessly flung in the air and plastered to the wall that i remember so fondly as stupid child. Mibibli is a crowning achievement, right alongside Shovel Knight, that really takes me back to the past while constantly feeling new and fresh.Side Note : It will seem like a mess of random pallets and tiles everywhere, but just stick with it. This game pulls its own weight, even after asking such a tall order from its players."

,Recommended,453990,29446280,Posted: 23 January,all,Jazz,"Brutal yet surprisngly fun gameThere isn't much platforming per say, most of the gameplay consists of dodging enemy fire (like in SHMUPs) and avoiding deadly obstacles. Game is pretty brutal, there is a health system but you get killed in 2-3 hits, spikes and botomless pits are instant death, and health pickups are placed behind additional obstacles. At the same time it feels very fair, there are no untelegraphed or undodgeable attacks. It still takes some time to figure out enemy or level mechanics (each level has different sprites for deadly spikes, which can be somewhat unexpected). Levels aren't too long and usually have 2 checkpoints so you won't lose too much time by dying.There is a good variety in level mechanics, almost every level has an interesting gimmick. For example, there is an underwater level where all jumps are higher, or a DDR-themed level where all projectiles are move hints you should press to avoid damage. Same goes for enemies, they have mechanical differences instead of stat differences.Visually game is nothing special, it looks OK though a few times it's hard to tell which object is a spike or an enemy until you touch it, but it's not much of a big deal. Music is actually quite fitting and enjoyable. There is no plot.No controller support. Keyboard controls are tight, but I wish the game didn't stay too true to old two-button controller scheme. Later in the game you get a dash ability which is used by pressing Jump + Shoot + Move at the same time and timely use of it is quite vital in some places, but it takes time to get used to the combination. Also there are no buttons for specific weapons, so weapon switch takes time. It's not much of a big deal until you get to level rush (optional bonus level).Took me around 6 hours to beat. For current price quite a steal as long as you like these kinds of games."

,Recommended,453990,25043322,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,TimeForCrab,"Mibibli's quest is a colorful, humorous platforming adventure that brings us back to what made some of the classic balls-hard platformers like Mega Man tick, while still adding and improving in its own flambouyant style. It's got responsive controls, clever mechanics, and challenging levels, holding true to the NES's style of gameplay. It also has beautifully accurate-to-the-NES graphics, an amazing chiptune soundtrack that goes perfectly with each level, and a certain retro styling to it that I've honestly never felt anything similar to. One of the only issues I had was that the controls are quite restricted. There are no customization options, and no gamepad support. Despite these things, Mibibli's Quest is still a fantastic adventure that I would go on any day. A rad retro throwback, Mibibli's Quest is an addictive one-player platformer bringing us back to the greats of platforming that I would reccomend to any fans of the classics of the genre. This game scores a smooth 9/10."

,Recommended,453990,33014895,Posted: 29 June,all,0danmaster0,- It is a fantastic Mega Man style game with responsive controls.- Every level has something unique about it to make every stage feel different.- The music is amazing and incredibly catchy.- The powerups you gain in the 2nd world are mostly useful and make Mibibli feel more powerful compared to the start of the game.- There are difficulty settings.
76561198250357154,Recommended,453990,33580466,Posted: 16 July,all,Dry-Dry,"Two years ago, my friend stole my laptop for about 10 minutes, then gave it back to me with the original version of this game booted up and ready to play. Ever since then, it has become one of my favorite platformers of all time. I almost feel ashamed about just now finding out about this version on Steam. Needless to say, I instantly bought it and now I intend on playing it for many months of tears and cries of joy to come. Sooner or later, once I finish this paid-version, I'll come back and edit this on my thoughts on the new content. For now, I already give this game 1,000 thumbs up, if you like platformers or a great challenge, buy this game."
76561198561650721,Recommended,453990,34741830,Posted: 4 September,all,Pkoco,"This game is basically Mega Man in feel but only with a floaty jump which I personally prefer more. Aside from that this game is very challenging so if you're not familiar or don't have the patience for this type of game then its hard to recommend. Its my biggest gripe with it, now there is an easy mode which can help you if you're not familiar with these types of games. But the intent is obviously meant for the more hardcore platformer fans. With that gripe aside there is another, being this game can be hard not impossible but hard. I'd say the normal difficulty is your standard Mega Man difficulty with the Mibibli difficulty being it's own beast. Not impossible, however there are some instances of cheap deaths or ""begginer's traps"". Also the flaw or positive depending if you like it, of chosing which level to pick first since this game does let you choose levels in any order you want. It's not as if, you can choose the hardest level early on, you can only choose one set of levels at a time till you go to the next set, but some levels are harder than others. If you want a fair platformer with a difficulty that gets harder over time, this game can repel you away with its choose what level you want to tackle first even though one level can be harder than the other. It's trial and error for what to go for first, to some that's an issue but for people like me it's one of the joys of the first playthrough. Other small things include not being able to pause the game, no audio settings and no controller support (although you can map your keys with third party software, but its a small extra hassle). There is also one stage with a computer theme and it wasn't clear to me what the gimmick was,but it seems others got it quick when I handed it to a friend. It might be a personal thing but, because I didn't understand I was stuck there for a good couple hours the first playthrough.With the negatives out of the way the positives are really strong, for one this game is pretty meaty, it has quite a few of levels, well worth the price. All the levels are designed to teach you a mechanic in a safe enviorment and test you on the next. It's for the most part all wonderfully designed. After you finish the first set of bosses you go on to the next and upon defeating them they give you powers. Some of these power you find your self using all the time, while others find yourself not using at all.These powers are different weapons or abilities. You hold up or down to scroll between weapons which is good because it takes a second to change a weapon, although sometimes you wish there was a seprate button to switch faster, but its not like it takes long to change weapons in the first place. Anyways the weapons and abilities you find good are really good and help a lot with the hard stages. The bosses can vary from easy to hard which usually reflects how hard the level is so more often than not you'll pick an easy level with a easy boss and not vice versa most of the time anyway.The sound direction is satisfying, shooting an enemy and hearing the 8 bit explosion just feels good, the jump sounds makes a good sound. In general the sound effects make the game feel more fun and I really appriciate it for that. Speaking of sound the soundtrack is one of the best in video game history and I stand by that. It's mostly 8 bit but its not restricted to 8 bit and will show it's true colors when it want's to. I whole heartly recomend the soundtrack if anything.The story in this game is simple you have a rivial you really want to kill him and so you try and do so. But something tells me its deeper than that because of the visuals and the certain songs making you feel something more. It's like an acid trip with a message and I personally believe there is deep ones. However I might just be out of my mind and over thinking these things, but I found the deeper meaning (if there even is one) to be life changing. I'm not saying what it is for you to find it (or not) yourself, but it certaintly changed me.This game is one of my favorite games, its in my top five for sure, I recommend it if you really like platformers, if you aren't I'm finding it hard to do so, there is easy mode, which I can recommend to an extent. Its fine if you pick easy but I feel this game is for the more hardcore, and if you do go easy, Its at least a way to experince this hidden gem.Very good game and I recoomend it for you to play at least once."
