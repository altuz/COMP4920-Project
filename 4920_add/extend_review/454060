,Recommended,454060,22981772,"Posted: 14 May, 2016",all,dauntedyeti,"To start this off, I love this game. There are fewer things in this world as satisfying to me as building a system that can automate a task so I don't have to be directly involved once the system is running. Set it and forget it.This game does that really well. After I get a production chain up and running, it just take infrequent checking to make sure it's still meeting the needs downstream.The issue is, they don't keep running. In the current build of the game, the buildings (not just 1 specific one, but any and all of them) stop producing or stop delivering items. Output stops, so the chain breaks, and everything downstream that relies on that building stops working.Up until I got to Tier 3, I was able to keep an eye on everything and keep deleting and readding the chains as they would break. With Tier 3, I have 4 islands running and I can't manage it. I've had to wipe and start over 3 times because it got so broken, buildings collapsed because their needs weren't being met, and there was nothing I could do to catch back up.This is the only bug I've found, but it's game breaking. I can't continue to progress in the game while this bug is in the production build of the game.That said, I will be monitoring DAILY for an update to come out so I can resume playing.8/10"

YESLIKESSigning contracts for different final products keeps it interestingBlueprint builder “mode” is easy to navigate and see the outcome of improving efficiencyThe music is especially nice and chillThe tutorials ease you into the game in a great wayScenario editor and Sandbox modeSteam Workshop supportGreat game performance even with many supply chains in the mixTips show when losing money, factory not producing, worker needs aren't met, etc.DISLIKESNot all buildings clearly display their use such as “worker” or “market”The building icons are too small at times and zooming in often doesn't fix the issueThe Final WordBlueprint Tycoon has everything you could want in a management and tycoon game. The tutorials are very welcoming and help you immediately acclimate to the game's fundamentals. Once completed, the difficulty slowly ramps up in a short “campaign” mode which expands the building and research options. From there, it's all up to you and how you want to build your supply chain empire.The graphical style really plays a part in this game. It's as if someone literally rolled out a set of blueprints on a table and said “have fun”! Watching your workforce carrying products from one building to another can become mesmerizing especially considering you can continue to add more buildings and more workers.Players can toggle “route mode” with a hotkey showing where the product is coming from and where it is moving to. This can be daunting at first but Blueprint Tycoon makes it easy to get a grasp on this concept fairly quickly. Successfully setting up the perfect supply chain left me with a sense of accomplishment and only made me want to play more. The game also has islands you can colonize to produce different products. For example, sometimes your main island won't be fertile enough to grow wheat – time to expand! The island system adds another level of complexity because you have to ensure your main island receives the goods it needs for industrial buildings.Overall, I love Blueprint Tycoon. It is challenging enough to keep you engaged while also not making you feel at all frustrated. If you enjoy complex supply chains, worker management and fun, Blueprint Tycoon may be for you.Read the Full Review"
,Not Recommended,454060,23663292,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,yanamal,"This game is a perfect illustration of the need to playtest early, often, thoroughly, and with fresh batches of new people. Ithas some really interesting ideas, but the interface keeps getting in my way. After an hour of playing through the tutorial and, after that, 3-4 attempts at *actually* figuring out the system by playing through the first level, my reaction was ""man, I really hope this is an early access game"". If this were early access, all of these issues would be perfectly understandable, and I'd recommend the game as an intersting take on the genre. But nope. It is not.Starting with the tutorial,where about the 3rd tutorial message blocked the button it was telling me to click. I eventually figured out that (1) the button is under the tutorial message window and (2) you can move windows around. But juggling tutorial windows continued to be a problem.The tutorial itself follows the not-so-fine ""oldschool"" tradition of showing you some stuff you can (and ought to) build, but not explaining how all the numbers fit together and how the systems actually work. Or, half the time, where the numbers even are. or what they mean (some of the numbers are percentage values! I could only tell after I noticed, through observation, that they vary from 0 to 100.)The systems fit together in an intersting way, but they don't make intuitive sense, so they are really hard to figure out at first. Workers MUST have roads to travel when they are working, but they can magically teleport to their place of employment as needed, as you re-distribute workers and build new things. All transportation MUST happen via workers, over roads, with you manually specifying the path(which, of course, is different from the road.). Except when it doesn't, because a flying thing does it automatically. There are at least 3 types of flying things with 3 different sets of limitations that don't really make much sense. I had a hell of a time figuring out why I could build buildings, and *sometimes* I could build objects, but then my production was halted, all my wood-related buildings were filled with wood, but my object-building building was complaining about lack of wood. If you are confused, then welcome to my world.All the right clicks/left clicks/mode changes/pause/unpause/ context-sensitive highlighting just do not flow together into a coherent thing, especially when building new stuff. Each time you build a (production) building, you have to do 3 separate things: roads, supply paths, blueprints. All of these are in different contexts and sub-menus. The only thing that tells you what you got wrong is a cryptic icon on the building, which has no word translation. And I hope you remembered to manually pause before you started fiddling with the bluepripts! especially if you're just starting and you're not profitable yet.The blueprint idea is cool, but the interface makes me really, really miss and appreciate SpaceChem. Also, thus far, there's not much interesting I can do that's not already in the default blueprint. And I'm sure that by the time I'm advanced enough for the default to be sub-optimal, I'll have already developed a habit of clicking ""default blueprint"" (which, btw, you can't even examine easily...)why is the storage building in its own separate box instead of in the building menus?why does space take me to the main building instead of pausing/unpausing, like in most games that have a pause functionality that needs to be frequently used?what is with roads altogether? why are they necessary? they don't seem to cost anything. they're just more busywork.there seems to be a lot of busywork/challenge by annoyance stuff in the system like this: e.g. the separation between the delivery storage and the actual delivery area, and the way the workers manage that path, which is totally different from the way workers work in any other place.Or the fact that the interface makes it super hard to have a high-level view of most of your production pipeline (except the very end, we really care about the very end of the pipeline!)Why does 5 worker houses give me 63 workers? worker houses seem to be the one and only way to get workers. but how many do I get, and why?do ""available"" workers even draw money? how am I supposed to figure this out?Why are there two ""route"" buttons, and why is there so little visual feedback as to what the heck I'm making when Imake the path, and whether I succeeded in making it? why do I have to click ""new route"" to finalize creation - or worse, edits - to the route I am currently working on?why are there so many clicks involved (in such arcane and counterintuitive places) in starting to make or set a blueprint, *especially* for the object crafting in the Main building?why do *some* buildings have directed in/out doors, but others have two-way doors? what is the point of one-way doors in the first place ('dwchallenge' through annoyance?), and why is it inconsistent?If it's called a ""default"" blueprint, why isn't it on by default? Do you know how many times I've set a thing into a queue in the main building, only to discover soooo much later that my queue is stopped because I forgot to click the ""default"" button?why won't my automatic delivery storage-to-delivery men take the milk from the storage and deliver it right after I set up the route? why do they have to wait until the next day to figure this out?what principle does the air baloon use to decide how many items to deliver at a time? it seems to vary quite a bit.why don't I get any benefit out of an overflow of income? I just lose everything above what I need to pay my workers? why do I care, then, that I ""missed"" some income - a thing that stays up in red constantly on my screen if my efficiency in the one specific area it's measuring is not perfect. (who cares about all the other pieces of the pipeline though!)some things make a ""wrong"" buzz sound, even though they are just asking me to interact with a follow-up menu(e.g. please specify the type of item to transport) and others do not, even though the game has refused to do the thing I asked for (e.g. not enough researchers for research.)sometimes I need to get more researchers, but the game tells me to get more workers!it's often not obvious which window I'm interacting with, and even sometimes that I'm supposed to interact with a pop-up window, because the hierarchy and the placement of windows is very strange.What are the green numbers on the Delivery that are similar to, but not the same as, the prices for the products listed on the contracts?I keep finding that my routes get changed or cancelled seemingly without my intervention, e.g. I finish one research, start another, and later find that it's backed up because somehow one of the trash runs along the route is just not there anymore. Or suddenly I am no longer selling any cheese or milk because my cheese/milk balloon has randomly started 'delivering' things in the opposite direction than it used to. did I do that?.. I don't know! I wish it were more clear when I did stuff and what the effects were!... I keep finding more of these issues, but I think you get the point."

,Not Recommended,454060,23277029,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,Malor,"It's not very expensive, and it's definitely worth a few dollars, but I'm pretty mixed on it, overall.   I'm right on the cusp between 'positive' and 'negative' on this one.Basically, if you're familiar with them, this is a variant on the Anno series games.  That is, it's about building complex supply chains, and dealing with the logistics involved in moving lots of stuff around.   Like Anno, it's split up among uslands, with different islands being good at different resources.  Unlike Anno, the islands are TINY.The fundamental engine is pretty interesting, but the space problem is so overwhelming that I end up not having very much fun with the game.   It's just.... it becomes such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to try to work around yet ANOTHER space problem.  There's never enough room for stuff, so you can never build what you really want.  Getting through a level of Blueprint Tycoon ends up feeling like work, because it's just this endless hassle trying to figure out where to squeeze something else in.   The way the buildings all have fixed entry and exit points only exacerbates the problem, making it fairly impossible to use space very efficiently, when using space efficiently is THE thing you have to do.  It's very frustrating.Anno has similar complexity in their economic model, but you've got like ten times as much space to work with, and you don't have the facing/spacing issues.  I find those games a LOT more fun.I'd enjoy BT more if the islands weren't so tiny.  But, as is, I got a few hours out of it (it says 19.6 right now, but I actively played it about eight), and I'm done.  I just can't face the tedium of trying to build up yet another economy on five or six postage stamps."
,Not Recommended,454060,28893613,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Kaminix,"I love the concept of the game, but I'm not a big fan of the execution. It mostly comes down to me hoping it'd be more like Factorio and less personnel management.The blueprints, one of the main focuses on the game, don't matter much in my experience. I probably didn't optimize it to 100%, but you also don't need to. By default you'll already produce way more than you can transport with any given production facility, so unless you want to put half of your workforce to work transporting chicken nuggets you won't really need to optimize that by a lot. Blueprints only affect the speed, not the resources used, and speed isn't really a problem since you're never really pressed for time. I also find the actual making of blueprints very unintuitive.Lack of control. You're factories have input and output, nothing else. You can't for example say ""do A if B"" whichwould make resource allocation much more fun in this game, your main resource is workers so I'd like to be able to set conditions on which my workers chose one task over another.No automated transports. Everything requires workers, not just in the early game but for the entire game. If you want to speed up transports of some things you usually just need more workers. There's some stuff you can do with balloons and ships (which can be upgraded for speed), but they're pretty limited in scope. I found transporting things to be a much bigger challenge than optimizing my factories, for reasons stated above.Interface. Your factories show the blueprints they use to produce stuff, but not what they produce. To know what something produces you have to either recognise the blueprint or remember what you placed there. In my opinion this is a problem.If these things don't bother you however, go ahead and get the game. You'll probably like it if these things aren't a problem to you. Also YMMV, perhaps I've just misunderstood the game and some of these things can be made better if you play it correctly."

Its not about building and managing a single facility. Its more of... managing a whole array of different industries. But I digress - its a ""Factorio Lite"" with a sub-level building aspect you find in SpaceChem but then again, I dont think this would do the game justiceTo start: YOu get an Island and a mission - produce a certain good a number of times. Based on the Scenario the Item you need (or rather the chain of Milestones leading up to it) are more or less complex. Starting with get some workers, Research an item for a better contract, get more workers, do more research... The things are usually similar but always need careful planning to do, because your resources are either limited to a certain part of your Islands or the biggest and most non-renewable resource - Space - might run out.Now, while your tech level inceases, so do your possibilities - and the needs to get those possibilities running, and with that your systems get oh so complex. And once something stops its the fun of debugging.Once my Jewelery-factory didnt do jack because it had no gold ingots. Turns out the gold ingot factory couldnt handle its waste management because it was still outsourced to the mainland, but my ships did no longer load trashThe Graphics are simple, but they dont need to be fancy - you can see everything you need. Everything is marked in a way that describes the building and thas all that counts.the game comes pre-packed with 6 scenarios, 3 tutorials, 3 regular campaigns and a Campaign Editor to ake your own scenarios to share on the workshopOverall: if you like continous problem solving and optimization, theview of a machine that ends up well oiled and working and are on a tight budget this is your game."
,Not Recommended,454060,23049420,"Posted: 17 May, 2016",all,Serg,"I'm on the fence about recommending this game. For its price, you can get a few hours out of it, but, personally after playing it, I was left with a few questions as to where certain features are.There are (from what I was able to see,) 6 campaigns. The first 3 are tutorials, the latter 3 being actual scenarios to play through. Each scenario is like the previous scenario, except 'bigger,' which, doesn't necessarily mean better. Instead of expanding gameplay, each scenario is just more of the same, with more requirements and longer production chains.There is no freeplay or sandbox mode.You are told how much 'profit' you are missing out per-tick, which causes (for me,) a mental overhead of trying to min-max each industry, only for the missing profit to spike again after unlocking the next 'quest' inside a scenario. I can accept missing out on profit, as long as everyone is happy and I can work on another part of the mission without a big reminder of how not-perfect my current supply chain is.In the tutorials, there is a demonstration of 'optimizing' each building, except, most buildings come with a premade optimal default you can select. I got excited after seeing there was a potential of 'optimize' my buildings, except, in the first two scenarios, the premade default is good enough/the best and no optimization is needed.I didn't really understand the relationship between workers, income, and consumption. I usually just overbuilt until someone complained, as I didn't have access to any sort of meaningful stat: ""Workers consume 1 food per day, and this building produces 5.2 food per day.""I was hoping buildings would be able to produce a range of materials depending on the blueprint selected, closer to SpaceChem. Instead each building only produces a single resource.Further, I was hoping we could toss more workers into a single building and change the blueprints to account for these new workers. Instead each building has a fixed amount of workers, so there often isn't even a reason to change the default blueprint.Minor, but it got on my nerves after awhile: too much bright blue. I like the idea, but it was a bit annoying to stare at the sea of blue-tiles for a few hours straight.IF it was in Early Access still, my vote would've been 'sure, maybe.' Since it's out of Early Access and there may no longer be any support: 'stay away.'"

Although the game appears simple, Blueprint Tycoon has a complexity about it. The challenge increases once you start playing around with the actual blueprints in order to find a more efficient and quick way to produce the desired materials you need. Yes, you will find yourself frustrated when you change something, don't know what you changed and it disrupts production, but the reward for seeing the level of efficiency approve in harvesters and other buildings is entertaining. The production tree, colonizing islands for fertility, and satisfying the needs of your workers remind me of Anno except stripped down to a base level with blueprints. I think it is a great, creative game for the price, and well worth it."

It's fun for a while but when things become more complicated you are solving logistics almost all the time and thats all you do. Get goods to the right place, in the right amount and at the right time. Everything is connected to it and it's essential. In addition you have to keep workers satisfied by giving them stuff they want and having good revenue balance by selling produced goods. In the conclusion you have a one big mess and don't know how to change things so you simply give up if you are not a masochist. Blueprint tycoon tries to motivate you with every step you take by unlocking a new building, new upgrades or giving you new targets (midgame goals) but still its not enough to keep you entertained for a long time because the complexity and the mess you see in later phase of the game.I recommend this game, its not the best piece of tycoon you can find, but still it is interesting and entertaining experience for first few hours and it costs just the right price.5/10  Average tycoon"

E.g.- In the tutorial, it tells me to make milk. How? I've built all the buildings available in the UI, and none of them produce milk. Ok, I quit out of the tutorial at that point since it seems deadlocked.- I try a sandbox game.  It has 3 items involved in making Iron; there is coal, iron ore, and iron ingots. These all show up in the UI as tiny little gray-black asteroids. But wait, there's more!  In the trade route UI all the icons are even smaller, so they are these little 16x16 blackish-icons that are completely indistinguishable. Oh, and if you don't have the needed resource, it then puts a red ""X"" over its tiny icon to make it even more impossible to read. I try mousing over the thing, but there are no tooltips.- The interface is inconsistent; I'm never sure when right clicking will get me out of a menu or trigger a new menu.  Multiple small frustrations like that.- I try a sandbox game. I'd like to build an airship, but to do that I need to get iron stuff into the Main building. How? It doesn't have inputs or outputs. Can I send the resources to my Construction building? No, it doesn't take them either.  Who knows.- I try a sandbox game. I'd like a ship to iron ore to one island and then take back iron ingots. After fiddling for a while and then going to the forums, it turns out you can't have 2-way trade routes. Your ships can only haul goods one way.  :(- There's no real game there?

Endless Loop Studios have also previously developed Survivor Squad, Survivor Squad: Gauntlets, which are top-down survival-horror tactical squad based games and Gamecorp DX also a management simulatorCurrently, there isn’t really a story but the basic premise is that you take the role of a Logistics manager given the task of completing various scenarios in the most efficient way, therefore, maximising profit. Whilst in the current alpha version (0.08) there only exists a tutorial and one scenario, it takes a fair amount of time to complete both of those. There are of course many more scenarios planned as well as a scenario editor with Steam workshop integration to extend those much further.(for more see preview: link at top)Overall, I have to say this is a very promising game, it has a fairly long way to go (0.08 remember) I definitely think Blueprint Tycoon is going to be a lot of fun, whilst currently, it feels very casual and could benefit from a form of multiplayer in the vein of Offworld Trading Company where you compete to produce X at the cheapest price at the fastest rate. There is a lot to love here, add to that a lot of people – myself included feel the game is rather underpriced at the current £1.99 price tag. I’m very excited to see what comes next with Blueprint Tycoon. Also, the former coder in me loves the various endless loops that the initial loading screen has for the developer splash segment."

It almost feels like a stripped down version of Factorio.I don't want to say it's real drawback is lack of tutorial, cause it has one, and games in which they hold my hands for hours drive me insane, but, there's definitely a bit of a lack of flow to the UI and context clues don't give you much of an idea of what to do.Perhaps enhancing the warning system, like when a building isn't connected, it should ALWAYS tell you, not just at first when you're going through the tutorial.  Like, if there's no path to a building, or a building doesn't have a blueprint.  It seemed like these alerts stopped showing for me and they would have been useful the entire time.This game works a lot like writing a program, and if the compiler fails, it should spit out a bit of an error.Oh, you've built an unused building over here, demolish it or make it useful!It kept me playing for much longer than I expected it too, and I do rather like it despite it's stripped down minimal nature.

Ive seen videos of people completing the totorials on youtube, but I cant even FINISH the first one. I get to the part where you are asked to build a coal harvester next to the iron harvester so you can produce iron ingots. I build the coal harvester where I am told to put it and then nothing works after that. The game doesn't recognize Ive done this step. Ive set up roads to it and made a route for workers to collect it, but the harvester doesnt produce anything to be collected. EVER!!! Ive tried uninsatlling, reinstalling, try a new game, verifiy game cashe integrity. NOTHING, still the same problem. Not only the first tutorial mission but every mission does this at some point. Tried the next tutorial mission, got to a point I need to produce uprade tokens, the game will not produce the tokens. I have the matrials. They are ready to be picked up, but nothing happens and cannot make progress. Its unplayable for me at this time and frankly I wish I had never bothered with this game. (BTW this game can run on a potato, so why are there so many complaints about it not working right?)]Within a few hours there was apparently an update that has fixed all of these problems.

There is no proper introduction (which is not good), but once I got the hang of it, it was really great. As the name already implies, the blueprints are the USP of this game and this is indeed true. They are important enough for the ""bigger picture"" during a mission, but still require you to invest quite some time to improve the default blueprints.- At the moment it is possible to overcome one of the biggest hurdles of the game, which is meeting the needs of ALL groups of workers, by researching everything and then simply getting rid of the complete researcher (and needs) + lab (vials) prodction lines. Feels wrong, but makes it easier- The complete UI is still not finished yet (I hope). Controls feel very clumsy at times, especially managing routes can become bothersome. Also the blueprint editing could be improved a lot (step-by-step debugging of setups etc, remove all moves with one click)- Performance issus when it becomes very complexThat's all I can think of at the moment...In sum, this is a great game in its alpha and definitely worth playing (especially considering the very low price - (I bought it for < 3€))"

For that reason I rate the developer of this game highly as an alpha-developer.All in all, this is one of the better alphas I have played - and it is now in full release with many of the issues I highlighted in a previous review have been fixed:+ Right click menu implemented as a simple radial (in keeping with simple UI)+ All islands show the ""fertility"" graphic when a building is selected to be built instead of just the hovered island+ Some fine tuning of buildings/workers/research seems to have been done, making population easier to manage (along with pathing improvments)+ You can now specify which pathing routes can take which materials (this stops any material being taken on any defined path)+===+ UI +===+I quite enjoy the somewhat simplified world graphics (although this can start to get busy when you have little people legging around with parts) and the UI is also quite simple.  I started off playing this game with Steam controller and I have to say, even though controllers are not supported, this game made it easy to use (almose entirely point + click with WASD camera movement mapped to joystick).Buildings are only 1 level deep in the build menu and are organised in a sensible manner, (houses, raw resources, combining buildings/factories, research buildings).  One of the things that is not immediately obvious, (but boy is it helpful when you discover it!) is the sales graphic in the top right.  This little display shows you quantaties that you are currently selling, any special orders you have going and (crucially!) if you are bottle-necking your deliveries building by not supplying it with enough product!+===+ GAMEPLAY +===+As with the Settlers/Cultures/Factorio this game is mostly about building production chains and managing them.  The tutorial is a simple guide to get you going and then you get to dive straight in and crack on building.  As with the Settlers, there are many layers to how you build, what you build when and how you manage your resource chains.In addition to the production chains of buildings, there is a sub-production element within each building.  This element allows you to manipulate the chain of production within each production building.  Each building starts off with a default (which is pretty efficient), but there are ways you can tweak the chains to make them more efficient (sometimes doubling/tripling building output).  This is a novel idea and one I quite like to get lost fiddling around in just trying to eek that little extra from my buildings - but the default blueprints are pretty effective as they are.With the Settlers you could eventually get yourself in a position where a thriving city could fall and crumble because of space resrictions and having to force that poor little settler to walk from one side of the city and back again with his cargo.  Eventually the roads would upgrade (if travelled enough) and finally your settler would gain a donkey to help speed him on his way.  In Blueprint Tycoon you get hot air balloons and trade ships instead.  Trade ships allow you to transfer large amounts of cargo between islands (but are restricted to a start island and an end island - building circular routes is helpful, and perhaps the developer could implement a return cargo slot) whereas hot air balloons are pretty good for doing cross-island hops from storehouse to storehouse.  This allows you to spread out your production over larger areas.+===+ SCENARIO EDITOR +===+As promised by the developer, there is a scenario editor in the game.  The editor is pretty powerful allowing you to modify just about all of the aspects of the gameplay (resources, research, buildings) and with some good Steam Workshop integration to boot.+===+ TL;DR; +===++ Simple UI with useful graphics+ Easy to map a Steam controller to the UI interactions+ 1 layer deep build menu, sensibly organised by building type+ Plenty of building chains already implemented+ 5 research tiers to work through+ Easy to transfer goods long-(ish) distances and thus spread out production+ Easy to spend hours playing with the sub-mechanics of the game+ Great scenario editing capabilitiesAll in all, I would recommend!"

Generally, it's the same kind of gameplay you get in games like Caesar 3 or Anno, but streamlined, and with little imaginative differences. For example, production buildings themselves have a little puzzle to them, reminiscent of SpaceChem but not nearly as difficult, which lets you optimise them if you want, although I've stuck with the defaults it gives you so far and not had trouble.Early Access is no lie though - it's pretty rough around the edges. Stuff overflows the menus and windows sometimes, the notifications in the only scenario are way too frequent and distracting, and some of the UI is barely there at all. My biggest problem is a lack of clarity: that there's no way to see what a production building needs before placing it, you can't see what resources are on an island before buying it, when looking for a resource you can only check one island at a time, etc. I'm sure these will be ironed out as development continues but for now it is a bit frustrating to play.It's hard not to recommend it at £2, and I look forward to seeing how it develops."

,Recommended,454060,22615207,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,omony,"A nice game with a nice and balanced mix of ideas.- you place buildings that operate based on a blueprint (that is, operation cycle).- you have to setup connections and routes to deliver goods.- produce output and deliver to the delivery point.- research new things (just like in Factorio..).- there are some targets (contracts) but I don't get it. :-)- there is also a TODO list right in the menu. There is a lot of work to be done by the developer. However, the game is already stable and is full of features.The gameplay is lightweight compared to similar games. Original and simple to control micromanagement makes this game promising. At the moment there is no much inside except a tutorial (which is well-done) and one scenario. The game is in it's development, still stable. Don't miss this one!// End of reviewMy wishlist to the developer:- The goals (targets) must be easier to learn and evaluate. I do not get it. What is reputation and what is the consequences? How can I understand is contract OK or under supplied?- Better icons! :-)- Sandbox regimes, random maps, tight goals.And some crazy ideas to the developer:- More resources with different life-cycles. It is useless to dig into micromanagement (to the blueprints) when everything is very fast. Long-growing crops with unstable production would add complexity and weight to the blueprints.- Non-linear production lines. For example, different crops should be milled on a single mill. That would make blueprints more important as well (so that, one would adapt blueprints to increase production multiple times).- May be the tools should be produced and have a limited life-span (or boosters to the tools).- External economy. With a simple system like this one it is easy to mimic real-old-world trade relationships. It would be great to introduce gold (or coins) so that one can buy resources abroad and earn coins with selling resources. The demand/supply may be random. You may introduce a bank node that accumulate and spend these coins. You may add a trader node that sets the prices for goods based on gold needed. That would be great to calculate PnL and to optimise production capacity to it. So that, thanks to bank and trader node, one can import some of the goods abroad, produce something, sent part of it to the contract, trade another part for gold to earn coins back.- Anyway, even without crazy ideas, the game is nice, inspiring and relaxing. Thank you!// End of wishlist."

But the fun, challenge and execution in the gameplay is 100% solid!There are 3 tutorials that each teach you how to plan, produce and make profit. Information is thrown at you, but takes you through everything piece by piece, then lets go of your hand briefly to make sure you understand how the mechanics work.

In addition, you also have to manage your workers and keep them fed/happy by giving them food and stuff.The problem I have, though, is that in the base scenarios the default blueprints are typically the most optimized so you rarely need to change anything. The same problem exists in some of the user scenarios, but those can be changed per the desired difficulty.I felt like the game should have had you using ""bad"" blueprints to start with so that you were actually enticed to improve upon them yourself. I did find myself improving a few blueprints, but typically they are near the end of the production chain, which makes them have little actual effect on the overall production speed.Maybe I haven't played enough yet to see some of this, but the game kind of gets tiring fast if I play it for too long. The UI certainly needs some work as it looks as if it were ported from a touch-screen platform. That said, if the UI was better, the game would improve significantly.Overall, I liked the core idea behind the game but ultimately I was left wanting."

I enjoyed setting up my production lines and making adjustments to manage efficiency.  Customizing the blueprints your production buildings use was a neat touch.  I was able to improve the efficacy of a few of the defaults; however, the defaults are still pretty good.  That being said, you will likely be done playing after going through all the scenarios.  You could try a user created scenario or try making your own, but otherwise there is not much to do other than replaying a scenario and try to finish it faster.  You are given the option to continue playing after finishing all the goals in a scenario, but there is little reason to, since there’s nothing to work towards.  Aspects of the game are repetitive, and many of the goals consist of waiting for your factory to produce something.  There is no punishment for taking longer, so often just waiting some time is easier than trying to improve efficiency.  Still, for the price, I recommend playing this game."

Haven't played it till the end yet so might be possible that I need to edit some things in this review.Price is low, either because its early access or because this is what it is.The game needs a little bit more polish and then its totally worth a release version for €3,- to 5,-In my opinion the game could be a lot more though!The building and logistics are great and work properly, I think the art style is cool and matches the title. I don't quite get how to optimize the internals of each building yet because the default blueprint seems good to me but perhaps that becomes more obvious when you get to higher tiers later in the game.The tutorial is pretty good and does well at explaining the basics while still allowing plenty to be discovered on the first real map.What I'm missing is the tycoon part!As a long time tycoon fan, I expected this game to be about making money, but its not.The money part is more like a resource balance game: You have to pay your workers and therefor you export some goods. There's no point to make more money then what your workers need, because when the money bar is filled you don't earn more...Besides paychecks your workers also need food and a marketplace to dispense the food. Either I'm completely missing something or there is something wrong here... We pay workers, give them food and also bring it for free? No taxes?I would rather:- give them food and a home, no money- a home and money, let them buy the food at my markets- just give them money, they can rent my homes and buy food at my marketsBuilding should cost money and construction materials, not just construction materials. This would activate the 'tycoon loop'  Need more money to build more to make more money to build more. Buildings should get progressively more expensive to build with each tier, so that you actually have to wait a while sometimes to have enough cash. It would also make it a bit more interesting to make maximum use of each building instead of just plopping down multiple of the same being a no brainer.Upgrading buildings and buying new land cost tokens. These can be build in your main building and cost some materials or are received every once in a while with a supply drop. I don't think these add anything to the game as it is now. Research - Materials - Money should be enough.Because I can't find any info about the development (road map, plans, idea's) I can't really say where this is headed.This could be a great tycoon with loads of hours of fun and replayability in it, or will it stay an inexpensive fun little game with a completely justifyable price?

You use those to build a nice small starting base of operations. Those guys needs good; which you then supply untill you are ready to advance to the next tier. Thos eguys need other goods; some needing your first goods as a basis. All's fine and well while you use your excess goods to make some cash untill you can advance yet another tier.Then it starts to hit you; building space.

That should be worked on.I feel like I barely used blueprints. You click default blueprint, it works, and you move on. That's great, handy for making sure your production line works. However, the default blueprints should really be worse. I think it would be nice if you had  different blueprints for each tier, so when you upgraded, you spent a while designing more complicated, better blueprints. Otherwise, unless I'm really misunderstanding blueprints, there's little optimization that can be done from the default.It would be cool if you could change where the input and output where on the blueprint. Maybe you'd have to redesign the blueprint around that. That would give more blueprints to design, at little programming effort, and much more freedom of construction at the logical cost of ""Now things aren't lining up.""I think it'd be useful if there was a little more depth to carrything things around outside of factories. Upgrading and increasing workers is great and all, but maybe cars, trains? You could make it a lot more complicated, and add a lot more blueprints.At a price of three dollars, it's worthwhile. The art, while simplistic, serves its purpose very well. Though there's a feeling of a lack of challenge. Maybe you have to deal with workers protesting for silly reasons, or other companies sabotaging?"

It's like educating someone on common literature before telling them what a book is - they'll probably figure it out eventually, but it's not immediately apparent. You may have to watch a video or replay the tutorial to get the swing of things.Otherwise the game is pretty nice.

I might just be an idiot and not be doing the correct process but after doing the stage two or more times using the exact same building process I've come to the conclusion that its the messages freezing up. *ahem* I did NOT start writing this review before checking if the game had automatic quicksaving features so I knew BEFOREHAND that I could go back to a previous day. I've been searching for a light hearted game that I can play while my mind can wander, relax and think.

For some inexplicable reason, some of your production facilities won't transport their goods to needed areas. Instead, they just acrue product until their bunkers are full and stop, sit there doing nothing except emptying your bank and cause frustration because when you get big enough you can't even find the damn suckers.

However, the thing I was looking forward to that the game lacks is a sandbox mode, leaving us to try to create our own in the scenario editor. But I likely ran into the same problem: The scenario editor is way more in depth than we were imagining. Which is okay!The bad thing about this game is it's looking like it's made to be a tool for players to create and share scenarios of their own, but very few people are actually willing to go so far to create one.I think that the devs should allow us to import goods/recipes/blueprints/etc. from other scenarios, the ones the game supplies, into our own scenarios. It would save us ametuars time when we want to make our own. Alternatively, the devs should create a sandbox mode... but I see how it wouldn't really be easy, considering how each scenario has different requirements for goods and workers and the like.For the price, it's a good game, but don't expect much out of it unless you want to sit around continuing scenarios after you finished the main objectives. It's only a couple hours of fun otherwise, or however long it takes you to finish them. After that, you're stuck either dealing with the fact that you beat what little content the game provided, or start to create your own content, and be prepared to invest hours into that before it's even playable.TL;DR You get what you pay for.

I haven't checked out any of the scenarios as yet, but from I can see this is going to be a great game to sink some time into.

I admit I do not have the latest model PC, but games that are more graphically intense run a lot better than this does on my computer. There were a few bugs too. Sometimes it didn't recognise my clicks so selections would not be cancelled, and it wouldn't let me move the menu/boxes around even though it said I could so blueprints etc would be hidden behind the text box making it frustrating.That said, the game does seem like it could be fun. I liked what I played, and I wanted to play more. Unfortunately even if I could run it properly there is only the tutorial and one mission.

I felt like I was designing Boston because my area ended up making no sense. It isn't too much work to recreate building, but a way of rearranging in game would assuage my obsessive compulsive need to make a neat city.Overall it's a very enjoyable game, extremely addictive.

I think there should be an average speed or current speed of blueprint so you can tell that after the first 3-4 items, it will be a lot faster and that initial 3 second wait is negligible."

Blueprint Tycoon has a lot of depth in the core loop of balancing multiple competing supply chains. The core gameplay involves managing labor supply, resource extraction, transportation, and refining on a two stage pattern: On the first level, buildings, roads, ships, and airships form the common elements of the genre. On the second level, each building has its own cellular automata that can be programmed to provide faster speed, more output per input, or less waste. The default blueprints are typically near the best speeds I could reach and very resilient about recoving from a temporary stoppage due to empty inputs or full outputs, but at higher levels there's room to program them for lots of improvement.The implementation isn't what I'd demand from a major developer, and the game suffers from the lack of a few features like the ability to troubleshoot when a building's production blueprint hangs and the lack of an audio cue when losing money or reputation at the end of a day.If you like the economic-production-line niche, it's worth the few bucks. If you don't like that niche, Blueprint Tycoon is definately not for you."

Blueprint Tycoon is a resource management game, and is very challenging before you get used to it. Frankly, it's insane at the beginning. You need to get workers to build stuff and connect resource routes, but you need to feed and pay them, to pay them you need to sell stuff by which you need workers. Personally, I haven't messed around with customizations of harvesters because it's too complicated for my feeble mind, but still. When you create your 'world' you get settings like how easy and fast things are, and the island settings (Size rarity and number of islands), which, for me, makes it easier because I'm not 100% used to the game quite yet. All and all, great game that tests your skills. I'd reccomend it to anyone who's looking for a challenge. ｡◕‿‿◕｡"

It provides a bit of complexity though not as much as factorio but it does make you think in terms of how to get object B to appear from object A, for example, in order to make milk you need to have a cattle ranch as well as research it which means you need a red vials, lab and researcher house.My only complaint is that some of the senarios like the jewelery senario has too a certain too high of a demand for something (in my case that was researchers not having enough meat) those need to be tweaked like have a couple of testers test the premade senarios that way you don't have to go in and edit that. Unless your game is community driven (more than likely this is.) then you have done something wrong. There is one thing that bothers me and that is sandbox mode. It gives you literally almost everything right off the bat and I would very much love sandbox more if everything besides a few options (worker house, vegetable harvester, etc) are avaliable then sandbox mode would be more enjoyable. That's just me anyways what everybody else thinks is a completely different story.Overall, the game is a solid B. I love the way how the game functions and that you have to distribute resources to proceed, a sandbox mode is a great addition, and the music is quite nice though not a whole lot of variation, a few tweaks here and there then it's even greater than ever thought of.
