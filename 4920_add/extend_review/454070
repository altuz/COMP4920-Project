Vast lands to explore, monsters to see, lots of skills, cominations and some different options.I do think that this game offeres lots of potential.<-Pros->#New MMORPG game to explore.#Very cheap to try it out.#Ability to affect the product and help to find some issues.#Lots of items and effects, many skills and cool features to try.#Huge and vast map.#Can host own servers.#Global ranked server.#Pvp, although I haven't tried it yet.<-Cons->#Still in early access, yet you can contribute to the project to help it grow.#Still lacks some features that help you want to explore more lands.#Need more players so the vast map can be fun, because the current npc system doesn't make up for that space.My first gameplay footage(first time recording too so don't blame me ^^)Will upload more videos very soon :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSKUIeS6msw"
,Recommended,454070,24141222,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Zupe00,"- Original Review after a couple of hours of play -The server was moved after several days of being offline, and I was finally able to give the game a try.My impressions -Positives:+ Good variety of creatures+ Leveling seems fairly easy, at least in the beginning+ Can pick the skills you want to use+ No quests means you can really go do whatever you wantNegatives:- Mob AI is pretty bad.  Lots of them just stand around while you hit them, others kill you off with no warning or follow you forever- Mana regeneration is very slow, at least in the early going, which means you spend a lot of time just kiting in circles or standing around doing nothing- Abilities need better descriptions and equipment/skill points need explanations- Server stability - The server went down and/or I was booted at least 5 times in the few hours I played- Toxic community - I was pk'd by two different people multiple times that could oneshot me, as they obviously outleveled me by a huge amount (had mounts and everything, so there was no way I could run away either), and just rode over and attacked without a word.  I also had numerous other people decide to grab the loot that the mobs I was killing dropped, and/or ""help"" me kill something that was nearly dead only to grab the loot.Verdict:Considering the cost, I'm pretty impressed with the framework here.  The game has potential, but until some of the issues are fixed (especially the ""free"" looting issue and the fact that there seems to be no penalty for killing people that are trivial to you multiple times, both of which I can only see getting worse with a higher population), I can't really recommend it.- Updated Review -I've been playing some more, and did manage to find some people that didn't try to kill me on sight, and even a couple of generous players who offered tips and a mount, which was much appreciated.  Having said that, the community is still an issue.  Though this has become less frequent after gaining a fair number of  levels, I'm still one-shot killed at times, often by people I didn't even see approach despite watching for them (I have a feeling this is due to the ""recall"" points, as people pop out of thin air when they recall), and I've been killed while still logging in several times as well. I'll readily admit I'm not much of a fan of pvp in the first place, but I can't really understand how ""pvp"" where one player kills another in one hit over and over again would be fun for anyone.I'm also finding (in line with what's mentioned in the comments) that there's less variety in mobs than I originally thought, as a lot of areas are just empty, and the pve seems to be pretty repetitive, as even though I'm still at a fairly low level compared to a number of players, unless I aggro a huge group of ranged mobs or fight a dragon, I'm already not finding too many challenges.Having said that, I'm now close to 20 hours into the game, and have been enjoying it more than I was in the beginning, so I'll change my recommendation to a ""yes"" with the caveat that there are still a bunch of issues with the game that hopefully will be addressed in the future."

,Recommended,454070,24140541,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Panana Beel,"It's a fun little fantasy MMO. No quests or missions, all you do is kill different types of monsters for xp and loot and explore the world. Be warned: There are some nasty creatures that lurk far from the castle, and even nastier PVPers. However, since there are so few players, chances are you won't get attacked while out training and exploring. I've been killed once in the 7 hours I have played and it was right outside of the safe zone.Pros:+ Relaxing+ Casual game mechanics+ Easy to learn+ Hidden treasures (Hint: Explore more.)+ Ability to host private serverCons:- Public server is down A LOT. At least once a day for the past 3 days. NOTE: Hosting your own private server is still doable.- BUGGY. Enemies will come after you and just stand there, not attacking, like statues.- Shop items are overpriced. (Personally, this is not a con, but I've seen complaints on forums about it, so...)- Lack of party system. There is only local player chat."

,Recommended,454070,22879604,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,Vezmarok,"(ONE QUICK NOTE, DEVS FIXED A FEW THINGS THAT I'VE SAID. VERY GOOD DEVS)In this state, I found myself to actually enjoy this game, it's very unique.Currently, there are many changes that can be made, such as the tree rendering distance, I find that on ultra graphics, I still see too little of the details further away. Maybe put it a step up? Like Ultra-high or something.Also, the main problem I have with this game is the exploration, exploring is a pain because you're gonna have trouble getting to areas because of the character stopping at areas. Also, the characters cannot drop. You can't fall at all, so trying to fall, you won't be allowed to do that. Trying to go down a mountain? You can't do that, you have to go around, through the enemies.The last problem is night, Night looks very very bad. Change the sky from brown to black, also while on a ship, the islands look very blue-ish, change this too.Honestly, the lag is the last of my issues. At this stage, I'm still having a VERY fun time on this game, I find it a great time wasting tool, just focus on what I've said, and your game could outstand many others on early access.I'm recommending this mainly because of the cheap price, if it were $10 - $20 I'd probably say no. But at this price it's worth it, get some more work done, and maybe it could be worth around $20, I hope this helped.Thanks ~Vezmarok"

Grindy, quirky, buggy, unfinished, but more enjoyable than most f2p p2w  titles. Go figure.PROS:- awesome idea, professional execution. the game feels familiar and pleasant- open world, go wherever, do what you want or just kill some skeletons for a reward- It has very ""oldschool"" feel to it, it is a pro in my books- extensive character custmisation on creation- spells/skills/abilities, A LOT of them, everything can be leveled up and used, your pick- play the way you like, build your own ""class"" concentrate on professions of your choice, or all of them- low price- regular patchesCONS:- Early access- very unfinished but things that are there seem to work fine- bugs, simple interface, unpolished models- not enough people to play with. At this point I would recommend playing it with some friends.Overall, i am very impressed and can't wait for patches to come. I would totally recommend this game."
,Recommended,454070,23151377,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,Libertygeek,"I hadn't heard of this little gem before but glad I saw a friend post some screenshots of it.   First off let me say that this game is still in very early access.  Also even when playing local your internet connection must be stable for you to play.  I found this out the first few times I was trying to play and I had something downloading in the background.   I disabled the background download and then was able to connect with the local server.  I have plans on picking up another copy for my daughter for us to play LAN with once I try it out some more.As of this writing I have about 90 minutes in the game.   I will say at this point don't go into the game expecting any fancy graphics, currently they are very bare bones.  Your character is going to look off, but I am sure that will vastly improve over time.  Also there isn't any hand holding in the game yet.  You are going to have to experiment.One of the things I found out very quickly is that there are a mixture of mobs all around.  You might be fighting a level 3 Zombie one moment and then a level 15 Zombie Lord shows up.  The first time or two this happened I had my butt handed to me but I quickly learned the game is currently all about kiting.  Once I started doing this I was very easily able to takle mobs way above my level.  At level 5 a level 18 witch wasn't much problem as long as I paid attension to the attack queues.One of the things that took a minute to get used to but now I love is that this isn't like WoW, you don't lock onto a mob.  You have to manually make sure your spells are aimed at the mob.  Missing is a very easy prospect if you are not careful.  But I like this as it adds some more realism (well when talking a fantasy game, as much as it can be I guess).  Still if you learn to kite and watch the attack warnings you can easily kite a much level mob without much problem.Performance wise, the game is what you would expect for a $5 game that has just been released to early access, however I didn't have many performance issues that were not network related.  The rig I played on was an i7-860 2.8ghz, Nvidia 960 with 16GB RAM so no where near type of the line.   Framerates were low but once again this is in very early access and $5 invested.I will say that the game pulled me in after I got the ropes.  Still not really sure what I am doing past the kiting of mobs, but fun none the less.  I recommend the game, even at this stage, $5 already better than many $50 games I have tried.  I haven't checked to see if there is any crafting yet.  I didn't see any indication that if there is going to be that it is implemented yet.  Crafting isn't really my cup of tea.  None the less crafting aside, I will say that I enjoyed this more than I did with Wurm Online (stand-alone) which I ended up getting a refund on and paid a good deal more money for.I am not a great reviewer.  Often I just ramble.  But let me close with saying that $5 is worth a chance on this game, even if you let it sit in your library for a few months.   I have a feeling that it is going to shape up to be a nice little niche MMO/LAN RPG."

It was kind of disappointing, I was hoping to find a portal to another place or something, maybe I need to kill Satan first.Anyway, I recommend the game only because it could be better in the future."

I'm not saying this is the next best thing but honestly, if this one person can make an MMO like this, imagine what a team of this person can do.Bounel reminds me of back when I used to play custom RPG maps on Warcraft 3... You grinded XP for skill points and you found random loot or bought it from stores. This game is exactly like that. Large map, random monsters, random loot, and you grind xp... Become a criminal or a hero!  For 4.99 and an open mind, you might get sucked in like me.There is a hardcore mode with varying levels of difficulty. When you die, you cant play your character for X amount of time. So if you want a real challenge, brave the world in hardcore mode."

Really gave me flashbacks to the Ever Quest days. It features an open world, classless progression, and ""skill"" based combat (No tab targeting).- Cons -- The dev is no graphical master, the textures are sub par for todays standards and the models are very low poly.- The movement is questionable at times, getting stuck an what little clutter is on the ground. There is no jumping and the movement speed is very slow.- Monsters are pretty unbalanced at this point. Level 22 mobs spawning with starting mobs. I once had a level 300 or so manticore spawn basically right beside town and kill me.- On death you drop all your money and lose durability on gear. So far, there is no way to repair gear and it is destroyed uppon hitting 0 durability. As the game is heavly based on gear this can become really annoying with constant deaths.- The server pop is usually under 10, which is very unfortunate.- The ui is very limited and confusing at times. Lots of information on how stats work or what your total stats are is just not show.- Pros -- There is a lot of potential with the skill system. Unfortunately it's just really limited and bland at this point.- There is a tonne of world to explore (albeit limited right now on what there is to find there and the diversity in locations)This game has POTENTIAL, so much potential but unfortunately it's just not there yet. As of writing this review the game is on sale for about a buck. If you are at all interested I say pick it up to help support the dev but don't expect anything special right now.- Things I would like to see in future updates -- Better and clearer UI with more information available to the player.- Item sorting in inventory.- A way to repair gear. Items not being destroyed at 0 durability (Leave them as unusable).- A better tutorial for new players.- A way to obtain or fill out an ingame map.- More races and character customization.- Graphical improvements across the board (Models, textures, animations).- Performance improvements.- Standard attributes worked into the leveling system.- More frequent quests.- Party/grouping/guild systems.- Combat balancing.- Increased duration on buffs and summons (Longest as far as I can tell is 90s on a buff and most are almost half that)- Hotkey on item pouch"

While everyone else sells out to new balance systems, Boundel keeps things real with only guarded safe zones to protect you from her world.Murderers and Criminals are marked red and are fair game.  Even in the relative safety of the city, one can attack or possibly kill another player before they are KOS.  It makes for great danger and risk, which is also quite enjoyable.  The world is big enough that one can find an XP niche and go hide for a time to get stronger.The world feels neither enmpty nor crowded, vast for adventure, but sensible and navigable with some exploration.  Signs and roads provide the way.  Terrain is natural and flows well, circling round the main villages so that one can literally see where one is going by climbing a mountain top.  Awesome, in the true sense of the word.The spells are especially enjoyable, as one must aim like in FPSs.  Some are quite speedy, which satisfies my button masher.  Whilest many are timed and aimed for patient players looking for DoTs or devestating DD.  The skills are fun and without classes the player can try them as they please.  I enjoy the way the aggro works, even if it is a bit off at the moment.  Sometimes mobs do suprisngly intelligent things.  I was able to kite to 10 without much trouble, but then I got to lizards and they link.  This means intelligent pulling is a must.  That's a lot like Everquest was back when it was great.The graphics look like circa 2000ish, but they are beautiful, with sweeping landscape, rolling moiuntain ranges, deep oceans, and the immense clip plane.  Something about it is nostalgically wonderful.  It's clean and fast for good PvP.  It's got a certain efficiency that works well with many systems.  It doesn't have a lot of pretty environment, but it's easy on the hardware, well balanced for good play.  That being said, it's still well made and feels real.Some players are kind, others are vicious, & that is the point.  No quests means freedom and fun.  Gawd I am sick of quest grinding!  So Boundel is perfect for the mature mmmorpg player.  Is it confusing?  Yes.  Is the English rough?  Yes.  That is part of the fun!  All your Boundel are belong to us!This game is worth your support and I would have gladly paid $50+ for it 10 years ago.  At $5 it seems priceless.  If you don't enjoy a real-life experience this isn't for you.  No whining.  You die and lose your gold if you forgot to bank it.  There will be gangs in the future.  It is up to us to shape the community.  Plus with a LAN mode, if you don't like it you can go offline and play!  Sweet.Boundel is truly one of the brightest indie stars to watch throughout Early Access."

76561198033585486,Recommended,454070,25486967,"Posted: 12 September, 2016",all,Sandwich Detective,"I played this game for a few minutes or .8 hours... however ♥♥♥♥ing long that is. And I can say that i like it. It has some bad character models and some pretty crappy night textures, but I imagine that is a limitation of the designer. Hopefully he will invest in a better game dev to help spruce up some things. The combat is eh, very boring when you first start off and very clunky. I couldn't use the mouse clicker to attack and instead had to use ""Q"" and ""E."" Interactingw with things can be clunky at times, you'll point your mouse over it and nothing will happen till you walk into the sweet spot. Early out, you will get annihilated by the beginning monsters if your impatient. Another thing, FATIGUE IS EVERYTHING! If you run out of fatigue you can't run or fight, and it take a minute to recover. Also if you're overweight in your capacity, you'll burn more fatigue when running. Or at least i think so, maybe the dev will tell me otherwise. A few glitches came my way upon playing, one was two guards who appeared out of nowhere and killed everything in sight. Meaning they killed zombies, behemoths, dragons you name it. I literally just followed them and gained soo much good loot from it. I also hit the monsters with them and gained alot of XP, which boosted me ten levels. We traveled far and wide together, and before i knew it i was filthy rich, and chose to retire.I like the fact that you can play on your own server and don't have to pay for one. The idea of me spending 3 months on a game only to have the server go down, pisses me off. I hope the dev never changes this, cause this is a good system, and i'd like to get other friends to join me in a private world. Leveling is a ♥♥♥♥♥ unless you have magic guards. you'll be grinding FOR EVER. And i'm playing on maximum hardcore mode, the leveling is jank. All in all i have nothing really to say about the game other than i'm gonna give it some more time to grow on me. for now though, i'd honestly wait and see what a few updates and graphic fixes come.To the developer if you read this(note if you find any of this hard to program or implement, I understand. these are just some things i'd like to see in the game):1. Make mouse clicking a form of interaction and combat.2. Make leveling much faster early game (gets easier once you reach level 20 and can take on level 70's)3. Make the guards stay in town so no one can become a god adventurer like me in .8 hours of playing4. Increase fatigue or make it regen faster (seems fixed, but maybe the higher level you are the less it fatigues)5/10 it isn't the best but i think it can be*update: there is a glitch where if you don't put your name while creating a character it will load forever. It happened to me while creating a local character for my server. It's no big deal you have to restart, but i figured i'd mention it. I think this was fixed but i don't know.*2nd update: You can travel in any direction, great! Oh wait there are level 70 monsters inermingled with level 3 monsters... That could use some fixing. or at least make it to where i can see the enemy's level from further away than having to be on top of them. Also as fun as hardcore seems, the wait times get to be really outrageous. i'm waithing 13 hours because i wanted to check the level of a giant gheko but had to get within 5 feet of it to see... sigh*3rd update: So while on my adventures i decided to buy a horse, an over priced horse. DON'T BUY A HORSE! they use your fatigue when moving for some reason, and move slightly faster than your run animation. Also there are armoured horses, which makes me believe they can die, which for the price would suck donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥ But not to fear, i found out you can buy a boat and sail the sea... so once i find that vendor, i'm gonna investigate that. One good thing to the mountables is that they come in many shapes, like a raptor, or a ♥♥♥♥ING DRAGON TURTLE. I haven't bought any of those, but i really want to to see if they fair better than the horses, but i'd guess not. (I've finally got a dragon turtle and it is overpowered, with 180 defense. Also the other animals can move at different speeds, so mounts aren't that bad.)*4th update: DO THE QUESTS! I know i ragged on the slow leveling in this game, but upon doing some the quests, my level sky rocketed. just doing the beginning quest can make you go from level 5 to 8. But don't expect them to be fair, you can recieve a quest to kill a dragon upon reaching level 10. And dragons are level 154, or at least the one i came across was. Also don't expect variety in the quests, you'll literally recieve the same quest from 4 of the towns.*5th update: So boating is eh... there are many islands outside of the main land. The problem is there is nothing to do out there but kill the same monstesrs you'd find on the main land. Alos once again, boating takes your fatigue, and the speed is crap just like the horse speed. Actually i think the horse speed is faster than the boat. This wouldn't be a problem if the sea wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ING LARGE! It will take literal hours to make it to one island. Funny enough, there are merchants that will spawn on the sea, and random adventurers will also appear on the islands. SO in short don't waste your money on the boat.*FINAL UPDATE: (sigh) So after scouring the whole land, killing satan, finding the best equipment in the game (or so i think, i haven't found anything better), and reaching Lv. 30, I really wish there was something else. Also a few of the quests are glitched, either taking all of your health potions or counting 40 zombie kills when you only needed 5 and not allowing you to turn in the quest, or accepting the death of other creatures for it. Also, you can't horde gold, IT ♥♥♥♥ING GOES AWAY AFTER EVERY DEATH IN HARDCORE. Or maybe it just disappears after awhile, I don't know, it really pisses me off cause i had half a mil and now i have nothing. So in final, this game is eh, if there was something to do than i would love it. Skyrim is good because there are sidequests and you can go anywhere, but it has a story to fall back on. Hell even WoW has a ♥♥♥♥ing story. SO many glitches and bad modeling, but the lack of story took me out of this game. Maybe i'll leave it alone for 4 years and come back to something amazing. Highly unlikely. After everything i've pointed out, if you still want to play it, than go ahead. but i'd wait for a sale, and don't expect anything to amazing. Think a ps2 era game almost. Also where are the forests!? there are like two trees lying about, the land looks barren."

It isn't packed full of features yet, but it does have some fun areas to explore and lots of monster variety so far. You'll spend your time killing monsters, farming gold, gear and mounts for the most part. There's also open-world PVP, item durability, and day/night cycles that NPC vendors open/close shop around. (cant buy items/sell items to vendors at night.)Things I like:Item durability/loss.Harcore mode (if you choose)Open-world PVPDifficult monster encountersOpen-class system, without limits. Mix/match skills as you please.Old-school buffs and skill types. (reflect damage, run speed, protection, etc)Rune-teleport system. ""write"" a location in your rune and teleport there any time. Create a rift for other friends to enter, too.Cool items and durability means you dont get bored because you're always replacing gear.Stuff I dislike:Low server population so far, but this will get better.Not many other features/things to do than grind mobs and pvp, but it is fun.Occasional disconnect with steam, which will hopefully be resolved.

I’ve only played a few hours, but you can roam around a lot and find things beyond your level pretty easily.

This is what earley access is meant for let me say a few things. This is a mmo that encourages private servers, that could be huge for communities, and for only 5$ would make a great game to a community.In my eyes this could be a great game for a RP community with the full pvp, private server option. But it is a long way from that, first off the moment is horrific(as seen in viedo below) you click ""W"" and after a not instant response your character will move, then continue to move 2-3 more steps it is awful. There is zero emotes in this game and that's unacceptable for a mmo today(easily fixable tho). Combat was pretty standard for a mmo the graphics arn't horrible(although the starting robes are flat untextured black(once again fixable)One neat thing I did see was when I started I had two skills bound to Q & E which is fine then I got a new skill of my choice(Heal) from a fairly wide selection and it asked what do I want it bound to, so i picked 1.

And, surprisingly, laugheda lot.I'll chuck a tl;dr here because I'm prone to losing my train of thought: 6/10. Why? Because what it lacks in graphics, animations, sounds and intuitiveness, it makes up for with charm, and it has that in spades.So what's it all about?I've got to be honest here. I don't have the faintest idea. Like. At all. It's an indie MMO that's still in development (and if other indie MMOs are anything to go by will never be finished).-The core of the gameplay is divided into, what I'd say is 3 parts;1. The acclimatisation.So the game is different. Crazy different. The UI is a mess. The skill system is absolutely borked, it's functional, but just damn awful. There's no targeting like most MMOs, but it's not hack and slash either. It's kind of point and slash... Or point, wait then slash. It's bizarre but refreshing in the most delightfully terrible way!2. The grind.The first quest you get, or at least that I got. I don't know if they're different per person, I doubt it but still. I really should research these things, remind me to fire my researcher. That's me... Sh!t... Ah review, Right. Back to it, the first quest I got was to kill 30 skeleton warriors. Great. Straight out of the gate and already I'm doing ""Kill x mob # times"" quests, but, at least they weren't fetch quests, amiright.3. The Battle.Once I've looked in all the shops (Which is double click by the way??? It says in the tutorial it's space. it's a liar.) and bugger me if I didn't have any idea what I was looking at. Words and a number beside them, scrawled like a lunatic in his own faeces after a particularly long constipation period. It was madness. So I set forth on my adventure. Only to be killed. Repeatedly. Finally, when I was triumphant, after learning that the skills in the skill book are actually useful and for some reason most melee attacks don't connect (Thanks Obama) it was evident that the really terrible fireball (or what ever it's incarnation is in this game) was more reliable than a dagger.-Of course, most games are those 3 things, they just hide the workings a little better, not all of them of course. *points menacingly at Assassins Creed*I have gone off on such a tangent, hang on.Right. Is it worth £3/€4/$5?Yes.Is it worth more than that?Oh god no.Will it be when it's finished?I doubt it, really, really, doubt it. But, Minecraft was a piece of garbage at first too so who knows, (wo)man.-side note. Why is it when you say man, it's like chilled out at a friendly term, but saying woman sounds like you're about to beat your wife? I never understood that.THE CHARM... I knew I forgot something.Well, you see, it's kind of like wanting to play an old RPG. Think windows 98/XP era. The graphics were stiff, the textures frankly just a mess but yet Nox, Outcast, Diablo I & II, the Ultima series. They all have such a special place in history, and when I play this game it brings back the memories of a simpler time *cue Hello Darkness my old Friend*Such a long and rambling review. If you've read up to this point I applaud you, for you are a scholar and a gentleman/gentlewoman (even that sounds weird) and as payment, I shall impart you with the knowledge that there are over 50 types of sphincter in the average human body.And yet you're the biggest a$$ hole out of all of them... I mean, why are you even reading this? I think I need to get out more."
,Recommended,454070,30249310,Posted: 28 February,all,johndraugr,"[UPDATE: 5/01/2017 9:41p]It's BACK! Private/Dedicated server access is back although there doesn't seem to be any admin functions or a server-side gui or command box (windows) that shows the server running and any important info like most servers do, but I believe the dev mentioned an actual dedicated server upddate/release was coming soon which may add the missing admin functionality.Since I can host my own server again, I'm changing this review to a POSITIVE one. The game itself reminds me of Everquest in some ways. There are some weird controls such as attacking, and the 3rd person over the shoulder view, but give it 10 minutes of playtime to get the hang of it and then you'll start having fun.Thanks dev for returning the ability to host our own servers.[UPDATE: 2/28/2017 6:35p]OK... An update. The dev has confirmed that the ability to host PRIVATE/DEDICATED servers is indeed no longer possible, but the features will return after the Mac & Linux OS version of the game releases. As such, I am a little relieved, but STILL since one of the main selling points for me was the private/dedicated server hosting capability, I cannot in good conscious alter my review from Negative to Positive. As of now this game is no longer playable to myself, my wife and my friends all of whom played on my dedicated online server.Once the features that were the main selling point to me return, I'll change this review as necessary.BEWARE!!!!!!!New update appears to REMOVE dedicated, private or locally hosted servers! If so stay AWAY if you are expecting that! I purchased this game because I LOVE online RPGs but I ONLY purchase games where I can host my own online private/dedicated server, hence WHY I purchased BOUNDEL when it was first released. Today with the new patch they stripped that feature out and it is now Online official server ONLY! Had this been the case from DAY 1, I would have NEVER bought the game. They also had the feature to build your own maps and such. That option has also been removed. Boundel is now no different than WOW or Guild Wars and a poor one at that (when compared to those titles).I have posted, but have NOT received a response to this new decision. If they continue to operate this way, I have demanded a refund because the program no longer operates or contains the features it originally did and which sold me on the game when I first saw it listed on Steam. If they wish to remove those features, then they need to compensate aka offer a refund to those who purchased the program for those features. Had they NEVER offered the ability to host your own server and to build your own maps, I would have NEVER spent my hard earned money on this game!BEWARE!"

Think 1990'sYou cant even tell what skills do based on the discription, when you lvl them up nothing happens no stats changes (at least that i could see). I lvled up magic arrow to lvl 4 and it continued to show 1,4  which i assume means 1-4 damage although the spell doesnt say that.You have to press space bar while highliting shops loot and whatever to interact with them.(the thing that made me quit)combat is clunky as all hell.   you have to hit a specific key like for example a basic melee attack you hit Q button then there is a little casting bar that charges then your character attacks in the dirrection you are pointing a red line which is how you do all targeting in this game. you cant just use mouse clicks to do basic attacks you have to ""cast"" your combat attacks.  You get this red line when you press some form of attack that is very hard to control when  monsters are right ontop of you.  Its a chore to play this game becasue the combat mechanics are so horrible.  I can overlook all other aspects but the basic gameplay to just kill monsters makes me feel like im working....game in general is pretty stupid.The way in wich you sell items, equip items, Toggle run on and off and a number of other features are completely unclear, they are done in a way that is foriegn for most gamers and thus leave you confused and un aware how to do even the most basic of mmo things.conclustionif combat were more enjoyable i would have played longer, and may even have enjoyed myselfPROSyou dont have to quest if you dont want to"

,Not Recommended,454070,26644575,"Posted: 17 November, 2016",all,Jack,"This game is unfinished. However it has potential and for 2.99€ (discounted) it is a good deal.It lacks alot of things to be honest, for instance there is no character screen where you equip items. Instead you equip all your stuff from inventory which u cannot organize that well. In the inventory there is no visual represantation of items, which would be a huge +, all you see is text. The items however change the appearance on your character when you equip them which is nice.Now I'm not a grammar nazi, I'm not a native english speaker. But goddamn the grammar is bad, I mean look at the description, this sentence has struck me - Discover the random generated open world as you like with free quests. What the ♥♥♥♥ ? It should be - Discover the randomly generated open world, with tons of quests. Or something along these lines. Free quests ? so I will have to pay for them in the future or what lol :D...The Visuals are pretty good for a 2.99€ game. It has native 21:9 support which is a huge plus from me. You can customize your local server, ie how many mobs spawn, modify weapons and armor.....There is no map in the game, but you can zoom out so far you actually see the whole world which is somewhat cool. But I would still prefer a map over this.Monster variety is pretty good but their spawns seem to be pretty random and inconsistent. You can find level 2 monsters and level 25 monsters in the same spot which is a huge problem if you're above level 10 (thats when monsters auto-attack).You can use every skill there is from level 1 if you have enough mana for it. Ranged combat (including spells) works ok with the mouse targeting. However close combat is so bad its not even worth using it. Also it would seem I cannot bind numericals above qwertzuiop, I can only bind numerical keyboard next to arrow keys which use useless because you have to use mouse to target spells.No classes which is fine with me, but getting the ability to use every skill from the get go is just weird."

In this game there are no quests and you set your own goals, it's a great sandbox.Lack of lore information may be offputing to some, but IMO it's more fun to create your own lore using that thing us, old farts call ""imagination"" :).The content in this game is great, there are so many available items and gear that I've barely scratched the surface of it all. And to think this game was made by just one person (aside of music) :)...The only issue for me is the lack of player housing (unless I'm missing something, there is none but it can be added in future) and the performance (despite server supposedly being in German and me being in Poland, I experience quite bit of lag and have to restart game every so often as the games tries to fry my CPU and turns into the slideshow).Overall, despite the flaws I've mentioned in the last paragraph, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. This is the only MMO that actually made me immersed in its world and when I play it at times I forget it's just a game. Then I notice the HUD."

Think of it like 3D Diablo or Diablo 2. You're just wandering around randomly generated terrain, killing monsters to get loot and gold and make yourself powerful enough to kill stronger monsters. Terrain gen is decent. Controls are stodgy, with an active aiming system for the combat that's just a bit clunky. Lots of mounts, and apparently includes a taming system. Gear's fairly varied, all shows up on your character, and looks pretty good. No class selection, so there's freeform character building. Enemy models are good. Animations are a bit weak.
