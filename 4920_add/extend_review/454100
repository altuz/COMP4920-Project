,Not Recommended,454100,32097642,Posted: 31 May,all,tonester,"so i got a 90% off coupon for this game and i decided to buy it to see what it really was. and turns out, it's just another typical platformer with no special value to it. i mean, there are spikes that fall on top of you at various points in some levels and you don't know about those until the very first time you get to that part of the level. i don't understand the score in this game since there's really no point to it.speaking about that, the achievements are just... eh. i would at least suggest that there are achievements for achieving a certain score, # of kills, or even a secret achievement about dying from falling spikes. if i want this game to actually be fun, a level editor would be nice so that i could play other people's levels as well.but then again, going back to my original point, it's almost like every platform game out there - except that this is too simple and would sound like an easy completion in just a few hours. this game is NOT worth your time and there are other platformers that have everything that this game doesn't and more."
,Not Recommended,454100,25018511,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,Salvia Hardon,"I have a medium level of experience in the difficult platformer type of game. Play through the first 8 levels feeling, ""okay, this is a bit of a super meat boy feel to it."" And then level 9 strikes and tells me that ""nope, you're playing I wanna be the guy now"".I don't much like this. I also find the hitboxes to be one of the most unforgiving that I've ever experienced in this genre. Also, I find that more level segments focus more strongly on getting extremely good timing at jumping between spikes, but much less on being good at strafing through them.I can really understand the folk who will love this degree of ""♥♥♥♥ you, player"" and all power to them - there are enough reviews to back up that viewpoint. Before I get told to ""git gud, scrub"", I found super meat boy to be vastly more enjoyable and I want to show that there is such thing as a player who enjoyed that but not dungeon escape."

There is no story, character designs are bad, the graphics are incredibly lazy, the music is low quality and generic as ♥♥♥♥, the concept is unoriginal and as simple as it can get, the controls are bad (especially with a gamepad), the level design is annoying and there's no charm or personality.And as a result the game ends up feeling like a weird mix between a random platformer tutorial and a late 2000s flash game.If you're looking for a good platform game on Steam play something like N++ or Khimera instead."
,Not Recommended,454100,34237718,Posted: 14 August,all,Meatnyan,"I bought this game because it was extremely cheap. I still regret it.Pros:- The price- Controls aren't awful""Meh""s:- The graphics- The music is okay at first, but gets a bit headache inducing and repetitive after a while- The difficulty is fine, though it does feel cheap at timesCons:- Bad hitboxes (not being able to double jump off of a corner of a block, not killing enemies if stomped at the edge, randomly being able to stand on the side of a wall)- No tutorial whatsoever, and while the controls and the concept of keys and doors are rather intuitive, it took me a long while to understand that you can stomp on enemies to kill them (in a lot of similar games, like Super Meat Boy, hitting any part of the enemies' hitboxes instantly kills you)- No story to speak of- No cutscenes- Can't navigate the main menu with the keyboard, despite the whole game being keyboard-only otherwise- Score doesn't appear to do anything, which makes collecting coins pointless- There don't appear to be any secrets or easter eggs- No unlockable abilities or characters (or at least not ones that I've been able to get to before quitting the game in frustration [not due to difficulty, which is fine, but due to the sheer amount of problems this game has])- No bosses or bonus stages (again, that I've been able to get to)- Bland enemies (the 2 I've seen so far, one blue and one red, are both effectively just moving square hitboxes with no abilities)- Bad level design (saws and enemies that can't possibly hit you, odd platform placement, coins that require no extra skill but extra time wasted)- Your character's falling speed is absolutely ridiculous, giving you no time to react whatsoever if the fall is just a few blocks down- Very basic move set (no running, no wall jumps, no dashing, etc.)- Awful achievements (Complete level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... are all separate achievements, and it doesn't feel rewarding, it just feels like the devs are trying to bribe you with free achievements)Overall, I don't think this game is worth your time even if it's free.I personally recommend Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Joy as much more enjoyable and higher quality experiences in the same genre."

,Not Recommended,454100,30645422,Posted: 20 March,all,Space Muffin,"This game is a disaster. The hitboxes are inconsistent and bigger than they look on every single trap. There are way too many seemingly pixel perfect jumps for the game to be even remotely enjoyable. Having a perfect jump after a perfect jump after a perfect jump does not define a ""difficult level"". It's just annoying and unfair. Once you get into the later levels, nearly every single jump is a double jump. What's the point of even jumping once if you're going to have to jump again anyways? Just remove the double jump and make the jump bigger. The level design is very poor and the visual quality of the game is boring. Now I have to finish this game so it doesn't make a stain on my completion rate.The only thing good about this game is the music. Actually decent."
,Recommended,454100,32293664,Posted: 9 June,all,Watplr,"If you want to play Super Meat Boy, but your budget is too small to buy actual meat for your family, this is the game for you.But really, this game is pretty good. It's challenging, looks decent, has a great soundtrack, and shows just how much you can do with a single screen. It's very minimalistic, which makes the game easy to run, proven by the game running at 200+ fps on my trash Mac Mini. The only real downside is the levels feeling a tiny bit unfair level 9 onwards, but maybe that's just me being bad at games and life in general.Overall, this is a good game, although I'd recommend waiting for a sale before buying it."

I beat the game, it was frustrating, but I knew what I was getting into.  Difficult mostly because of an unusually oversized hitbox.  But no big deal, if you're great at these games, it should take you about 1.5-2.5 hours.  Was it enjoyable?  Not really.  But did it deserve to get skull♥♥♥♥ed by my skills, yes, it did, and it was well deserving of the punishment.

,Not Recommended,454100,25244753,"Posted: 30 August, 2016",all,akhsavi,"Do you consider obsessiveness a deviation ?It's important question, you better know the answer before launching this game. Developer is, clearly, obssessed with preciseness in a very bad way and, probably, hate people.For me, personally, it has been worst 10 hours in my gamer-life regardless of the fact that, by and large, it's not altogether bad platformer. Nevetheless, only thing I want more than uninstalling this game, is causing some physical pain to its developer and all so-called testers.It's about:jumping;breaching obstacles, avoding deadly traps and testing your nervous system.Why you should play it:you like games such asFenix Rage, consider them enjoyable and easy;nice level-design: levels are different, distinct and, up to a point, passing through is interesting.Why you may not like it:no checkpoints: death means starting from scratch and that's a problem because game demands 100% preciseness at every step, gamer is constantly under the pressure and stress;some of the levels contain jump-puzzle - you need to figure out how to make jump (trajectory) or find the point from where jump to: so that, together with checkpoints absence, causes a situation when you spend limitless amount of time to get to that point at first, then some time to figure out a solution (starting from scratch every time) and only after that, some time to pass the level finally; in other words - you feel like on your regular working day;regardless of the fact that there're only small one-screen levels you feel that there's no hope to overcome difficult part, what's worse, it feels meaningless because after it another, even more crucifying, part of the level follows and mistake means starting all over again;zero enjoyment from playing, I would even dare to say that it's sub-zero: desperation, frustration, anger, despair - these are emotions it brings.I have no idea what testers were testing: maybe game doesn't have bugs, but it doesn't rejoice even a little as well. Actually, that's the main purpose of the game by default - deliver fun, this game dramatically fails in that.AVOID by ANY COST. I'm not joking - you have been warned.And, do yourself a favour, check stats of every player praising game's difficulty with positive review: highly likely one has progress stopped somewhere between 10th and 20th level... or even earlier.P.S. Dear developer,there are over 10k games in Steam library, there's literally not enough time to try them all and standing out your game through its enourmous difficulty hardly a good idea. You see, usually people are ones who play games, not androids or cybernetic mechanisms with astounding reaction. And, that may sound strange for you, people tend to do something to get positive emotions, especially, if we talk about entertainment. Your game isn't entertaining in any way - just to heads up.Please, sacrifice some of your time and checkMr. Bree+- that's how difficult, but enjoyable platformer must look like. Your game would only benefit if difficulty was 5-7% less than now or, at least, there were checkpoints. It still would be difficult, but much more satisfying.As my regards, I suggest you visit a shrink - there's certainly something you need to check about your obsession with precision."

Some of the levels are really demanding, yet I don't understand people complaining about the unfair hitboxes and having to do pixel perfects jumps – hey, this is what this game is about, go play Prince of Persia if you don't enjoy that kind of challenge...The graphics and colours are awesome in their simplicity.

It is similar to super meatboy. There are several ""troll"" moments like in cat mario and some people, for example me, might not like this moments, but if you´ll use some guide, you can complete these levels easier and I can see, that the developer reeds people´s reviews and helps with problems.

They’re often casual, providing a fun experience that’s both easy to pick up and easy to walk away from. Conversely, they can also be hardcore, challenging you to find every secret, collect certain items or do speed runs. Dungeon escape is another of theese platformers.Now, there are many different platformers with different aspects and modes which draw different people. You will love Dungeon Escape if you like;Simplicity - Its a platformer with just one goal, complete the stages. You can collect a bunch of score but thats your decision to make.A Relaxing game - With a soundtrack that is fairly intense it makes it easy to lower the volume and put on something else, music fits really well since there isn't any soundeffect or clue you need to listen for.Its worth the money! :D"
