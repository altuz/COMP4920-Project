76561198347279941,Recommended,454140,28659143,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,jsotirak,"First let me provide some background on me - I'm a high level trennis player - I played competitvely at the college level and one of my reasons for buying HTC was to explore tennis in VR. The bottomline: This is a good game, better in many respects than I expected, but it can certainly be improved. I highlight the improvements that can make this game better:1. Probably the best thing about the game is that it accuarately reflects the players attempt to hit down the line versus crosscourt - this was very impressive. However, it does not reflect the players attemp to hit high over the net versus low over the net - ie, lobbing is not possible. This results in not being able to hit the ball out by hitting it long. You can miss wide and miss in the net, but I wasn't able to miss by hitting the ball too deep - past the baseline.2. The angle of the racquet is mostly accurate - however, the game overrides really bad angles. For instance if I attempt to hit the ball on the ground by angling the head down, the ball can still go over the net. I assume this is set up to help people who aren't really tennis players. I understand this, but I feel making the game more realistic is worth it.3. The player is able to teleport from backhand to forehand instead of running from side to side - again I understand why, but I think there should be a no-teleport option for players that have the space and want a more realistic experience.4. I like that serving is difficult, but I feel topspin serves aren't reflected accurately.Again, this is a really really good game. If you play tennis I would 100% buy this game without hesitation. If you don't play tennis seriously, this game is also worth it as the realism is better than I was originally expecting."

I have played nearly all tennis games that have come out in the past. This is actually one of my favorites, but I think that's more because its VR as the actual game is good, but it still needs lots of work. I think it's too expensive but hopefully the developer will make some much-needed improvements as it does have a few annoying bugs.The + points for me are- It rewards correct strokes- Your racquet grip matters- Taking the ball early is important- Body position matters too- It feels very realistic sometimes- Ball control is there for the most partThe negatives, unfortunately, are a long list- Only one player save slot, so if anyone else wants to play, they are using your save game.- No rewards for winning tournaments such as player upgrades- The racket it too big and out of proportion to a real racquet- It's too easy in arcade more. After just a few game beating the top players was easy and requires little more than keeping the ball in play.- Your opponent can't return your net shots? It's a serious flaw.- lobbing is flukey and done by slicing the ball which is wrong.- Opponent animations are not great- Short balls for both players should be punished more- Needs more game modes- Serving in simulation mode is almost impossible- Hitting big winners should be more satisfying- More control over where you player moves would be great-"

Depending on how it comes along, this gamecould become very good or even excellent. Just needs a general fleshing out: spin (top and slice) is thebig thing that needs to be added; more ornamental animations and dialogue would also be of great aesthetic help .... ""hmmm good."" I would also love to see a more advanced practice mode with both stationary and moving targets - perhaps, make it for points a la arcade."

76561198048389017,Recommended,454140,28231050,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,Bridge Burner,"I bought the game an hour ago and here are some initial impressionsPros :1. Visuals are pretty good.2. Controls work very well. It was very sensitive to my real life movements.3. Lots of tournaments .4. The crowd applause and the commentary is a nice touch.5. AI looks like its pretty good.6. Training mode is really fun for practice.7. Makes really good use of room scale.Personal Gripes :Very hard to play. The ball comes at you really fast and is very realistic. I have had a lot of issues with timing and am just not really good at it.For those of you who are looking for a realistic simultor, it works very well.I wish there was like an beginner settings where you could slow down the ball just a little.Also the training only lets you hit, it will be good if the player can also practice serves.The game description says  ""Put the target on court to hit the ball whereever you like"" . I couldn't find a way to do that.Cons :1. Menu button does not work in most cases. The game asks you to use the menu button to exit but it ended up freezing the game in 90% of the cases.2. When starting a tournament, the game just went into an infinite loading screen. Had to force exit the app and start again.3. If you lose a tournament, the game takes you to a locker room but you cannot restart or exit. Pressing menu locks up the game. Had to force exit.4. Also many times when playing against the AI, the ball comes outside my chaperone bounds. Don't see a way to reset the view or move the player using any form of controller movement.Unless someone has a really big play area, many will run into issues with see the AI hitting the ball just outside the chaperone bounds. The camera angle makes it really hard to adjust in these cases.Note : I meet the minimum roomscale requirements.To summerize, a really good effort. Looks like the team wanted to make a realtistic tennis simulator and they have succeeded for the most part.Biggest issue right now are the crashes, difficulty curve and the lack of a proper tutorial.Based on my observation, none of the vive controller buttons are used for playing and the menu button for exiting.To all the tennis fans out thre - try it out, you might like it."

And you'd better do some physical warm-up before you play it.The only issue is that sometimes you get teleported too far from the ball so it appears behind the playzone borders.Otherwise, it's the best!"
76561198140470590,Recommended,454140,33825417,Posted: 26 July,all,DA REAL KIKOO,"I think this is the best tennis game so far, lots of fun to have! It is a great game to feel playing in real tournaments.First, I love the commentaries... it feels like play on TV... its very nice!Second, I love the feel of the game. I think the ai is well balanced, not too easy, you must learn how to win.Third, the game has many stadiums, and different court surfaces, so you really feel you are playing the tournament you choseAlso there were regural updates since my purchase months ago.If you are a real tennis player, your skills will help you at first. But you know how tennis a technical game and the small variations in your stroke will not reflect 100% ""proportionnally"" in the results. So you have to adjust to it to win games.One thing I wish was more realist is the serve. I could not use my usual serve gesture, but I got to understand the way it worked.Finally, I want to mention that I had a problem with one button and the dev responded to me personnaly, which is AWSOME.Mikori, thank you for this game, I wish you a great success!"

But ... :)Great game but some proposals for improvements1.In a tournament starting in Eighth-finals or latest at Quarter final the precision of tracking of the tennis racket gets lost. And the movement of tennis ball starts tostutter somehow.I tried it in many matches and the result was always the same.And it has nothing to do with my computer or OS. It's a win10 system with latest steamVR andlatest version of First person tennis. Graphics card is NVIDIA GTX 1080. CPU is CoreI7. 16GB Memory. HTC Vive.That's really disturbing the whole VR experience. Looks like it is a cummulated error over time.2.Could you please add more training units,like forehand only, backhand only, smash training...3.You added so many courts all over the world, but besides the court materialI can't really say where on the world I am currently playing. Maybeyou can add some typical items of the country or city I am playing in.Or some small videos?That really would be great and gives a more impressive, realsitic feeling.4.The audience could be made more realistic. That would have the effect of abetter immersive feeling. It looks like there are sitting clones of people ;)5.Make the referee and the ball boys(?) more realistic.The ball boys could collect the ball. Should look like in a real game.6.Sometimes the sound doesn't correspond to what I am looking at in the game.E.g. hand clapping, but visually no one is clapping7.AI of the opponent.It is pretty easy to win a service game. Just hit the ball with very low speedfrom below. This is almost always making the point.Same holds for lobs. The opponent is almost not able to hit the ball.8.Add something like a Hawk Eye experience, like it is used in Wimbledon.Give the player the chance to use it like in real games.9.Multiplayer would be great. Maybe it is a business case?Paying for taking part in a multiplayer tournemant with the possibiltyof winning a cup (and maybe money);)I really wish you all the best to make this tennis game a great success!My 5 cent and cheersJoachim"
,Recommended,454140,34366270,Posted: 19 August,all,FastLawyer,"The graphics in this game are absolutely stunning.  The game mechanics are also very fluid and pretty realistic.  It's also why the game is very difficult.  I scored only twice and double faulted quite a bit.  I also got quite the workout and had to quit because I was just sweating way too much.  Even on arcade difficulty, I found the game difficult.I think the one thing that can be improved is to have an assist on serving.  Just make a little bit easier for beginners.  There should also be a practice mode in training where you have balls returned to you that teach you how to attack your opponent.  The training mode is basically just serving and returning serves.  However, even though I practiced serves in training, for whatever reason, it seemed much more difficult in game (maybe it was just me).There's lots of customization options on your avatar.  Unfortunately, you don't really get to see it much while playing so it's barely noticeable.  It's a nice touch for sure, however.  There's lots of different stadiums and many surface types.  And different crowds.  This is almost reaching AAA type touches like you would see in EA sports.  Even the announcers were decent, if wrong at times.  They would say close shot to a shot that was way out of bounds for example.I had a few problems getting my ball in hand while trying to serve, especially after mistakes.  Other than that, I didn't notice any bugs.  Game ran very smoothly.   I didn't try local multi-player but that sounds like a neat option.  Just wish you could play another person also in VR.  That would be the ultimate VR fantasy come to life.Also, the game needs women.  I want Maria Sharapova :)Rating 9/10.  It's early access but it's very polished, amazing, best tennis VR game out there, a MUST buy especially at this low sale price"

With the most recent update to this game (just a couple days ago), I find it to be a really enjoyable and convincing re-creation of tennis in VR. Prior to this most recent update, serving in simulation mode was quite difficult, and the swing power vs. ball energy felt a bit off, but after the latest patch serving now feels really good, and the overall physics are greatly improved. I find myself making the same specific errors in this game as I do in real life. There still aren't that many VR sports sims available, and of the ones I've tried, this definitely ranks near the top of the list for enjoyment and giving the feeling of actually playing its real-world equivalent."

So don't play it if you hate to sweat or lose some weight ;-)Moving options might get some optimizations in further updates (I would love to move around by tilting the thumbstick like in first person shooters to move/strafe in all directions and therefore still be able to look and focus at the ball while running... At the moment you run by moving your hands like running in real life but you can only run in the direction you are looking so you might have to lose the focus on the ball when running sideways or backwards).

76561198020445786,Recommended,454140,31045368,Posted: 9 April,all,M1ng0J1ng0,"7.9 out of 10I must admit I have a bit of a thing about bat/racket and ball type VR titles, my library is littered with them. Table Tennis, breakout, golf, you name it I have something of the genre.First Person Tennis is the only VR Tennis game to date, and it fills another bat and ball void in my VR collection. My old review is posted below for context, since then all my minor gripes are fixed.The gameplay is fluid, convincing, and very rewarding when you win. This is a title I keep returning too and it remains just as enjoyable each time. As you improve the game becomes even more satisfying, playing a rally and forcing the play to set up the winning stroke feels great. And when things are running against me I feel stressed and tension. That's brilliant, a VR game that can affect your emotions means the immersion is working.The only negative, which I must admit doesn't make the game less fun is the AI animations are adquate but not impressive. The animations cover the basic requirements of movement and striking the ball, but it would be nice if the animated movements we're a bit more natural.Old review:It's very enjoyable, but not without bugs. You can serve aces everytime by serving under arm. I've had the racket disapear during games effectively breaking the match. These EA bugs aside I still really like this game, it's one I'll return too often out of my ever growing VR library.You need a decent space around you and feel confident to move in it as you aren't always placed in the perfect spot to return the ball so a step or so adjustment is sometimes required.Definately worth getting if you're interested in tennis, the immerision superb. It's a decent workout too making it a worthwhile fitness title."

The Dev is fully aware of our concerns and will in time address the suggestions given by us. Price? .. high yes , but if the A.I is improved , the  ball dynamics improved ,and by that i mean  the ability to perform different arrays of shots, and spin imparted on the ball then this will be the go-to Tennis sim for VR and in time with the hours spent playing tennis 'in there', it will be worth it."

The ball control is fair, so well done to the dev. There is room for improvement of course in different steps of the gameplay - i cant wait for the called expert mode. So I defenetly recommend it - it can only get better.Now the one big thing is DOUBLE BACKHAND. To be a real simulator the game needs to enable the possibility of a double backhand (which is currently the dominant form of backhand). Because the game uses the 2nd control to launch the ball on the seve it makes it not feasible to do the double backhand when you are serving (because you have the 2nd controller on the other hand). In fact i was serving and then putting down the 2nd controller everytime so i could grab my main controller with both hands when doing a backhand- not good.The game could release the serve ball with a minor wrist movement of the main hand because at the serving start positon the ball overlaps the raquet in the middle (not the most realistic of course but far , far better than killing the double back hand shot - which is 50% of the gameplay).PS - i played only 1 hr.. i broke the light fixture on my room. 1st game does this to me. It is emmersive , well done.PS2 - The dev. seems to genuinly listen to feedback and often replies to the posts which is great.enjoy!!!"

Now the game plays quite well.I didn't like the run simulation as what it is now. The speed could be a little faster. The run simulation also stops/slows down in between the points even if I kept pressing the left navigate button. I didn't like that. Most of time I couldn't get to the net in time with run simulation, so that I'd like to keep running until I reach my position. Stopping or slowing down in between points made it almost impossible to reach the optimal volley position. Please look into that and find a better solution."

The only way to learn serving is during the match, which is bad, as it takes time and efforts to learn it. Also, the game was frozen each time I pressed one of the buttons on controller. Visuals are Ok, could be better, there is a crowd during matches aplouding and a TV commentary, which is very nice. The ball is flying fast and it's so realistic. It takes a bit time to get used to it and hiting the ball proper way.NOTE to Developers : Please, consider adding one TENNIS WALL for practising and PRACTISING COURT WITH AI in a park without score board, just free playing, where player servs each time the way it wants. This way people can relax and enjoy playing without pressure and stress., which many often do in a real life.PS.

I love the gameplay, but I hate the gamekilling bugs and animations of the AI.  If you put the ball infront of the AI he will just walk very awkwardly though it.  Doesnt even look at the ball or seem to notice its there.  Please fix this.  Even with all that, the actual VR is supurb.  It could still use some work but it feels now like the tennis ball goes mostly where you want it to and feels good hitting it.  Some odd hits on net that i wouldnt have expected sometimes but it feels good.   There is training (get rid of all the cones please) and real torney modes with real players and world rankings.  That is what impressed me most.  Real names and everything.  The hub area between matches is nicely made too.I obviously cant tell as the game freezes on me before I can proceed any further, but I would like to ask the dev if you can actually eventually rank up to 1 now and play the top players?  Also will there be real added animations?   Im marking this as positive as I reallly want this to do well and I will buy again as soon as these issues are actually addressed."

It's a difficult yet realistic game with different levels. Unlike in the trailer, it is first person. It is just tennis. You can customize your person to have different strengths/weaknesses. But like I said the game is extremely difficult. There is a training are that helps a bunch, though.; Overall, fun but hard game.Con side: Here is a list of the bugs I've encountered *which happen alot* - When you leave the game with the menu button then come back to a game, you can't pick up a ball to serve (Closing the game then restarting the game always fixes)-When you hit a shot that's way off, the other player will sometimes just go still sometimes not even on the court. You have to restart the game.-This one isn't as much a glitch as it is just a downside, but it happens alot where a ball goes too far off and you end up hitting something trying to get it (However there is a feature that auto-runs you to the ball)-Hitting can be off with balls that go high.-When you miss a serve the announcer sometimes says it's an easy shot which pisses me off l_lOVERALL, IT'S A FUN GAME IN EARLY STAGES OF RELEASE. i 100 PERCENT RECCOMEND BUYING IT."
