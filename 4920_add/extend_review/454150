(Hold W whilst shooting the RPK for a 150 bullet lazer of death with 0 kickback.)Chainlink fences are rendered objects but you can jump through them.No vehichles.I will continue to play with my friend and cry about doing so.This is beyond early-access."

There is new guns and maps. The guns look good, better than they were a while ago. When you die the camera doesnt stop shaking. You cant tell when you are being shot, one second you are running the next second your camera is having a seizure. The game has gotten better but it still isnt good. The game has alot of potential."

,Not Recommended,454150,35237909,Posted: 27 September,all,SleepyDawg,"Bought this game for 50 cents with a coupon I gained from crafting a badge and honestly thats exactly what this game is worth. Not the 5$ full price, 50 cents. There are multiple bugs along with little to no multiplayer servers. There is also a lack of features that bring life to most games. These features are things like sound, animation, or effects when you hit a target( there is none of these things whether you hit something or something hits you). A few of the guns get stuck in the reload animation. The shop from the NPC is also lacking in features not giving any indication if you have successfully purchased an item and what not. Overall a poor game that needs quality of life features to improve it."
,Recommended,454150,24304163,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,[_TAS_] Dvck God,"Here is (almost) everything you need to know about the game.Note: I don't know the correct terminology for some of the things I mention, but hopefully you can understand the overall point.1. THE SIGHTS ARE LACKING- Although the RPK(?) has a legitimate 3D ironsight, the other weapons switch to a flat 2D picture of their sights (ex: the M4(?) has a flat 2D PNG of a red dot sight when going into ADS mode, and the Sniper Rifle has a poorly made PNG of a scope (with a white outline, product of poor alpha channeling))2. YOU DIE A LOT AND IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD- When you die in this game the first thing that becomes obvious is how quick you actually died; the second is the terrible killcam (the camera flails around showing everything but your dead body)3. THE GRAPHICS KINDA DO SUCK- It'd be aight and all if the game was a clean looking blocky game, but with the shadows dulling everything out and the textures making the blocks beyond flat, the game is just ugly as hell.4. THE VIDEOS AND PICTURES ABOVE ARE INCREDIBLY MISLEADING- You cannot fly or drive, and the game doesn't look as ""vibrant"" as in said pictures/videos.5. NOBODY IS PLAYING THE GAME- This isn't the developers fault, it's yours. Buy the damn game and get a refund at the 1 hour mark if you want to, but I just can't enjoy a game if nobody is there to completely destroy me.All that being said, the game is worth the money unless you are just a cheap♥♥♥♥♥ It's in Early Access so you can't go too hard on the guy."

There are only three Arenas and much of the options or other things are missing. But what is there is not to bad. The stages (maybe from the Unitystore) are small but nice. Handling is ok. The main problem right now, is that there are too less players in the game, the most of the time, i was alone (EDIT: since my review, i go back from time to time and check, if there are players. i found everytime i few. so you can play with others). So, it is hard to recommend. But, it is only a buck…and maybe you have some friends...This video shows all the things, that are in the game right now. At the end, another player entered the server.
