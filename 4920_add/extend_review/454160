It reminded me of old Fighting Fantasy books like House of Hell, mixed with a point and click adventure game/light RPG. Genuinely startling moments and creepy atmosphere, with an intriguing storyline and cast of weird creatures to keep you occupied. And lots of fishing. Highly recommended!"

It's a bit point and click, with (preset) turn-based battles. For such a simple game, I'm surprised at the weapon and armour upgrade system: the only grinding you'll do for cash and pelts for crafting involves a mini QTE. I loved this game, and kinda wished there was more of it. Definitely worth checking out, especially for that price."
,Recommended,454160,26740636,"Posted: 21 November, 2016",all,Baphomet,"Indie developers are known for throwing random gameplay elements together to see what works and occasionally things come together just right. Dark Fear is a hodge-podge of old CGA adventure games, turn based RPG combat, and horror stories all mixed into one game.First the good news, the game does manage to be “jack of all trades” and most of the individual gameplay modes are sufficiently entertaining. You definitely have to plan for a good majority of the boss battles, but if things aren’t working out for you, you’re always able to flee and prepare for another attempt. Additionally the game has its own hunting and fishing systems that can be used to farm for cash so that you don’t run into a dead-end situation. Most of the special weapons and magical supplements are easy to understand and have plenty of descriptions or lore hints to help you select the right combination to get the job done.Some parts of this game were unfortunately, not so great. The horror elements are more jumpscare than anything else and are kind of predictable and the hunting mechanic gets a bit tedious when you just want to catch that one level 4 creature to make the armor you need. These are pretty minor issues though, and didn’t really tarnish the overall experience IMO.A total play-through of Dark Fear will take you about 5 hours, which might not sound very great but for a $4 game ($2.40 on sale) that’s quite a bargain. Consider picking this one up for an evening’s enjoyment and don't forget to turn off all the lights!"

This game puts simple, direct writing, solid art and music, and unpretentious gameplay front and center, making for a fairly linear, mild puzzle, mild RPG game with horror elements. None of these is applied too heavily, making a short, jaunty game where you never get caught with too much grinding, or puzzling, or reading. The story is uncluttered and plain-spoken, which makes it effective. It's taken from obvious story tropes, but doesn't force you to read some endless soap opera or pretentious extended monologue. Characterization is succinct and the horror works -- all the jump scares got me. I really appreciate what the creators did here. Good game, worth the price for the hours you get out of it."

The umpteenth mobile game ported, blah blah, labeled Lovecraftian, yaddah yaddah. In short something I almost scratched from my Steam wishlist. But am I glad I didn't do that, but rather picked it up as a 'might as well try it' during the halloween sale.After playing it, I have to say I'd have bought it at full price. Heck, I can't recommend it enough tbh. The game is rendered in a semi-8-bit graphical style with mouseclick based controls. The music is VERY good, setting just the right mood. Combat is challenging, with a vague rpg flavor, though the game mostly sticks to the adventure setting outside of this. One important other part is the hunting/fishing minigame. Different flavors, but both are essentially the same, but you'll be doing a bit of a rampage on the wildlife in the game to pay for weapon and armor upgrades. Don't forget potions and tattoos either.The story keeps you intrigued and there are many locations to visit, monstrous beings to slay and not-so-hidden objects to collect. The downsides though? Well, not everyone might appreciate the art style, there's an awful lot of jumpscares for horror and aside from a math-puzzle the problems needing solving are not too hard. But those are minor issues compared to the fun there is to be had in the game.In conclusion: Get it~!Overview of pros and cons:ProsGreat atmosphereVery good musicCompelling storylineSome thought required for combatNice pixelartNot so easy achievementsVaried environmentsConsJumpscaresFairly easy puzzlesThe hunting becomes a little tedious"

76561198006276098,Recommended,454160,24275658,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,Samurai Cop,"Pretty delightful horror adventure. It contains a fairly interesting story as you the take the role of a man with no memory battling evil in strange world that I can only describe as a bit of a mix between a sort of American frontier gothic horror, along with a bit of medieval mystic fantasy. It relies on a few cliches but it feels pretty imaginative for the most part. A few moments in the game are geinunely startling when first encountered.Awaking in a dark cabin with no memory, your main goal becomes to eventually try to recover the truth of why you're here while you go about gathering all the map and amulet pieces scattered throughout the world - by solving a number of puzzles and battling monsters, wild animals, witches, and demons. You earn an assortment of armor, weapons, items, and other abilities throughout the game to assist you in fights with the use of gold. You earn gold at the end of battles but your primary source of earning money is from selling the game you catch in hunting and fishing. Success in battles relies mainly on planning ahead and being able to time your strikes to maximize damage. It's all really rather simple. Some of the final few encounters try to make things a bit more difficult by changing up the arrow speed in order to make it more challenging to deal a critical blow. Even if you're defeated in battle the game starts you instantly back at the Cabin without losing any progress or items you've already collected.Most of the achievements unlock as you advance the story but a few can be missed if you're not paying attention to them and save the game to far along to go back. It's also best to play this game as it suggests, with headphones and in a dark quiet place to get the maximum enjoyment out of it.It requires a certain amount of grinding but nothing to overwhelming. I honestly didn't mind the hunting and fishing, which I found to be sort of a relaxing rest point inbetween exploring and battles. The end revelation is fairly surprising if not a little bit silly. The ending tries to tie together most of your encounters but I feel like it could have been better if things weren't so simplified. I felt some of these things could have been better just left unsaid in the end. Sometimes the best parts of these games were what it allowed your own imagination to fill in.Overall Dark Fear has alot of the same charm splashed with a bit of cheesiness that made these games fun to play. You're probably looking at around 3-5 hours of gameplay total which isn't to bad for a game in this price range. Recommended for fans of horror adventure tales old and new alike."

Some genuinely startling jump scares. 5 hours to beat it, more if you hunt down all the achievements. The story is fun too. Definately worth the few bucks their asking.But the bad: ""RPG elements"" is stretching it. Yes, technically they're there but they're just an excuse to make you grind so the game takes longer. Only way to upgrade your capabilities is to buy weapon and armor upgrades and tatoos by going out and grinding on a swing meter in hunting and fishing mini games. If you don't do this, you can't defeat certain enemies and you can't do extra grinding to make fights easier because the merchants simply won't sell you higher upgrade tiers of gear. The fact that this is intentional is made obvious by the fact that every major enemy has exactly the right number of hp and damge so that once you have the right gear if you hit the swing meters right, you kill them right before they kill you. All the ""rpg elements"" could be removed and the game would be better for it, if 2/3 as long.Also, the writing is so-so. It's not awful but there are times words are used incorrectly and one major plot hole towards the end of the game. Aside from those complaints though, it's fun and I wouldn't let those stop you from buying it."

Short with some grinding, but well worth the price.Like a lot of retro flavoured games, you get the feeling that if this had been released 20 years earlier it would have been an instant and still revered classic.  As it is, it's a fun and genuinely scary game that I don't regret playing in the least.  The story is richly intriguing and well told, and the combat is simple but oddly tactical and tense.  Somehow, the occasional jumpscares are no less effective for the basic pixel animation, and the game's atmosphere is never less than ominous.One very minor con:  You will need to grind the hunting and fishing minigames to get the equipment you need to progress.  This isn't too bad, but the hunting/fishing is basic enough to get a bit boring and repetitive."

I've chosen ""Not Recommended"" but in all fairness to Dark Fear it was just over the line.This game is quintessentially mediocre, it's just good enough to hold your attention but its hardly a memorable plot or a particularly engaging gaming experience. Likened to the Horrorsoft games of the past I can see why people would make that comparison but I feel it's doing Horrorsoft a bit of a disservice. It's basically a simple point and click adventure with some basic combat and a little bit of grinding for stuff to make better armour/buy weapons.As I said, it held my attention and I completed it but there are probably better ways to spend your cash. The original Horrorsoft games like Personal Nightmare or Elvira are much better options (although you'll need to go elsewhere to get them)."

The jump from supernatural horror to straight-up fantasy is a little silly and kind of takes you out of the horror atmosphere."

It's got all of those inventory puzzles and problem solving you'd expect from a point and click, albeit scaled down and broken up pretty well by those other elements. The game's pretty short (I beat it within 5 hours, though I haven't gotten all the achievements yet), but satisfying.The positives:-The atmosphere's right where it should be; it's creepy and ominous, but without being completely oppressive-The sounds and graphics are both very nice; nothing feels out of place and the soundtrack and sound effects are both used well to complement the situation-The puzzles are at a pretty good level, not so difficult that I had to check a walkthrough every couple of minutes, but enough that they take some thought.-Pretty decent use of secondary elements to break up the puzzle-y horror-y main game.-The price is pretty low, which is nice.and the not-so-positives:-The plot's kind of predictable, nothing really out of the ordinary story-wise-One of the RPG mechanics is grinding for money with a timing-based slider minigame, which gets old pretty quick-The battle system feels kind of frustrating with its setup. Many enemies have abilities you need an item to avoid, which is often not obvious. This results in either losing or taking large amounts of damage, and waiting for your health to recoverAll in all I'd say it's definitely worth the price, and presents an interesting concept besides."

It's so much deeper than that.When playing, you'll discover a multi-faceted, horror-fantasy adventure with very light RPG elements that will provide a good 4-5 hour play time.You wake up in a dark cabin with no memory of how you got there.  Start clicking and use items, and after getting out of the cabin you will happen upon a village where your adventure really begins.  From this point on, you'll embark on a very atmospheric and interesting adventure that, while it may not blow you away, will keep your interest to the end without feeling like a slog.The graphics are very late-80s to early-90s pixel art, all of which are very well done and work to keep the environment creepy without feeling like they're trying too hard.  Through the game, you'll feel like there's a mix of medieval fantasy and early 1900s worlds colliding, which to me just adds to the charm of the game.  It really harkens back to the days when games didn't take themselves too terribly serious, and were out to entertain you and not be co-opted by hyper-political nitwits that think every game has to double as a commentary on society.The RPG elements are very simple in both execution and progression.  You can hunt for pelts, which can be used for better armor, increasing your hit points.  There is no grind fighting or levelling up, although you may spend more time than you'd like hunting for certain pelts needed for later armors in the game, which based on the very-scripted path of battles you'll face, you'll need to get better armor before you can progress at certain points.As for the horror aspect, it is well-executed.  Scenarios meant to be creepy pull it off well, and the music helps (The developer was even kind enough to explain the music is copyrighted, and offered an option to turn it off as a nod to content streamers who may face DMCA takedowns if they record a Youtube video with the music on).All in all, for $4.00, you're getting a competently made horror-adventure game that really captures the feel of old sierra adventures.  You won't regret this purchase, especially if you've been as disappointed in the recent glut of horror games as I have."

None of the puzzles were very difficult, and the jump scares were more so fun than frightening. Overall, I enjoyed about 90% of this experience totally.My only real gripe with the game is that the hunting/shop mechanic felt like it was put in there just to pad out the length of the game. The game is 4-5 hours long, and you spend at least an hour of that hunting things to earn gold so you can upgrade your load out. You have to do this, if you do not then you will encounter enemies that will simply one shot you. Of course, the game never ends with you dying...just like any good point and click...but you still end up wasting a ton of time hunting or fishing for gold. I get it, it is sort of a practice for combat since there is no pressure while hunting/fishing - but you could have just as easily given the player the necessary items to win through puzzle solving or because they need things like potions and are friendly to the NPCs. The game still would have been extremely enjoyable if it was only a 2-3 hour experience in old school horror gaming.So, in spite of the grindy bits this is still a really solid game. It has enough charm that I can sit there clicking on pictures of animals for a while in order to progress the combat portions of the story. Worth a purchase for sure."
