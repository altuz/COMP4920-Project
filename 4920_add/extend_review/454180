Controls are very hard to mantain and it doesn't hardly tell you how any aspect of this game works. The tutorial Completely disappeared when i tried to do it too. just to get to the next level you have to play the first level over and over. Which isn't necessarily bad, if the controls worked better and the level was built better than they are. The levels have almost no room for error, and when you add in the controls, instead of going fast and making the game seem really cool like the trailers, you have to be careful which way you turn and hope to god that alien spaceship (Or whatever it is) doesn't shoot you off the track."

It could be funny if your car have a minimum of credible physics, and responsive controls. I played through the first level only, why I can't play more ? Because I've some TrackMania tittles in my library. It's not so different and TrackMania is fast, easy to drive, fast, fun, fast, community based, fast, beautiful and fast. Keep away of CrazyCars, and get TrackMania² before the end of summer sale!"

Thanks mate :)I wouldn't say I was too disappointed by this as it was very cheap and looked equally so, but I was disappointed at the lack of content.The cars handle pretty averagely and the physics are difficult to master, but the tracks, of which there are two, are rather interesting. The Ice Level is really difficult because the surface is as lumpy as it looks and you really would need a 4x4 to manage a track like that.To me, this isn't a finished game. If it was in early access I would understand, but this is being sold as a completed game. Two tracks, three cars; just not enough to keep me interested. It's nice that the tracks have multiple paths, but all the paths are the same terrain with just different obstacles.This is not a complete package. You get some meager scraps of content in a physics engine. I had a bit of fun and frustration with it, but it's just not worth the money as it is. Add more content please."

However, it just felt sluggish, controls weren't great, and I got a headache.  I suspect it gets better as you unlock better cars that probably give you better control & speed.  But I woud fall off the track when I didn't feel I had sufficient control, and didn't really care much to continue.  (2/5 stars, buy it for trading cards)."

,Recommended,454180,22493056,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,Born 2 Game YT,"CrazyCars3D is a good game that is both challenging and fun at the same time although the steering could be made a little bit easier. You'll have a much harder time steering your car than what the trailer makes out. Your goal for this game is very simple, collect fuel can kind of things to earn credits and then use them credits to either upgrade your car or if you have the time to earn 100,000 credits you can unlock a new map to drive around on.My overall opinion is this game is good to play to kill time but that's it as there's no real goal to it. Just drive around, fall off the side of the map and respawn.7/10 would spin out again"

Have you ever trieed to go full speed into a laucher then brake to land on a floating island? It's not fun. however overall the game is pretty entertaining, and the soundtrack is really good. My only real complaint besides the janky platforming is the lack of traction. I honestly think this game is being played 100% on blck ice coated with oil. 7/10 especially with the cheap price. it will entertain you for awhile."

Probably the usual whiny PC master-race folks who blame losing every video game on ""artificial difficulty."" The game works great for me even with an Xbox 360 controller using the Linux version and it reminds me quite a bit of Gripshift on PSP with controls that feel like a mix between Twisted Metal and Crazy Taxi 2. I got this game on sale for dirt cheap and it was a good deal, and fun mutli-player. I'd say you won't be disappointed but if you're a whiner who cant play a classical styled game with puzzles, pitfalls and limited lives then don't buy it (go buy Undertale instead dweeb)."
