You are introduced to the concept of the game in the first few levels, and nothing gets added - just a slowly increasing amount of waypoints you have to pass through to get to the goal - the only real step up in difficulty is about half way through the second set of 16 levels when you start to get two pairs of waypoints of the same colour, although in most cases it tends to be fairly clear which ones pair together, but this mechanic does allow a few more interesting levels late in the game.In terms of the interface it is mostly fairly good - the menu is simple to use, and in the game I used arrow keys to move around and enter for the next level (saving having to switch to mouse until the set of 16 had ended). The main frustration I had was the animations for colouring up/down and the goal descending, which jar the flow of the game every time you get to a checkpoint on your route.So overall if you want a quick relatively simple puzzle game that can be finished in an hour or two you should be okay here, but don't expect too much."

It has 3x16 puzzles and took me about 3 hours to solve them all. Maybe a short gametime, but if you like puzzlegames just buy this. Its a good game and worth every penny.Room for improvement:- The movement of the cube and the colorchange is a bit slow even though it really doesn't have any impackt on the game- More puzzles would be nice - and maybe a random generator- Another background than white would be prefarable- Would be nice if you could use the main menu with the keyboard and not just mouse"

Some of the later puzzles boards are bigger with more colors, have a longer solution but they are not more difficult. I do like this game idea. I would recommend it to others, but if I could have a do over, I would NOT buy it myself. In my opinion, this game doesn't have enough complexity to be that interesting, and unfortunately, that complexity is limited by the curent boundaries of the gameboard (the main problem being, the more colors options the designer adds, the harder it is for him/her to disguise the solution path, which is why the 'smart' and 'genius' levels are not really hard at all. I think to fully realize this idea, the game board would have to at least be on some 3D, perhap even with klein bottle characteristics (cube can roll on either side of the 3D board).A minor complain is that I don't would like to control the speed of the cube so I can move faster and also I don't want to wait for the colors to change. By the time I make my first move, I already know the solution and I don't want to waste time."

For less than $2USD I feel I got my money's worth.10/10 - would think myself to sleep again.Pros:Very relaxing, a good simple game to take your mind off things for a short time.The audio really makes the game. Glad to see creative commons music used and properly attributed. The sound effects as you plod around fit just right too.It has a very gentle difficulty curve. Starts off incredibly easy and (very) slowly gets harder. The harder levels are a challenge too. There's three tiers, each with 16 levels - Normal, Smart, and Genius. I spent two hours with various distractions and got halfway through Genious. I'd say there's about 3 hours of gameplay and it's certainly replayable.There's enough puzzles that you should be able to replay it without memorizing all of them.Graphics are simple and clean and scale well between low and high resolutions. No problems with framerate myself.The game released today on steam so I'm not sure if any of this will change.Cons:I couldn't get fullscreen mode to work right. When set, mouse clicks are offset from where the mouse displays, making it impossible to do anything. I had to manually pull up the game files, edit the settings xml, and disable fullscreen to get it to work again.Menus cannot be navigated via keyboard. It would be really nice to keep the flow of things. On a similar note, it would be nice if the mouse's right-click could pull up the menu too.No controller support. The game lends itself well to being played via controller. There are mapping programs to map controls to keyboard keys but that's a bit overboard for such a casual game.Similar to another review, I had a bug where I completed a level but it didn't seem to register and bring up the level completion menu. Pressing escape seemed to force it up though. Not too big of a deal but I guess it's worth mentioning.I definately enjoyed the game and would certainly enjoy some new levels. Possibly more in the same difficulties or new difficulties with larger playing fields, more color variations, or even just one color for everything."

,Not Recommended,454190,22212199,"Posted: 2 April, 2016",all,Bill Belichick's Cut Off Hoodie,"Cubicolor's concept is fine if unoriginal and I wanted to enjoy it, but the horrid execution kills any potential for enjoyment.-Optimization is horrible.  For extremely simple graphics (which would be fine if it ran well) I get about 5-15 fps (on the same rig that I get 45-60 fps for TF2 with good quality settings).-Input lag, while not totally debilitating, is consistently irritating, especially when you move one space too far due to delayed input registration.-It would also occasionally freeze at the completing of a level until I pressed ESC to bring up the menu.  Again, not totally debilitating, but another annoyance and in a simple game like this a significant percentage of the experience.-Achievements are epically bugged.  I unlocked the achievement for completing all easy levels, no problem… BUT when I unlocked the achievement for completing all medium levels, the first achievement re-locked.  That's right, RE-LOCKING ACHIEVEMENTS ON STEAM.  How did the dev even manage that?  Sadly that can only be classified as an epic failure.  I have reinstalled and repeated this process twice with the same result of the easy level achievement re-locking upon another achievement unlocking.If the achievements are fixed and the input lag and framerate are improved (say by a factor of 3) then Cubicolor would be almost worth the price for 1-2 hours of gameplay. I will say that the music and sound effects are nice for this kind of game.  Hopefully it is fixed in the future.As it is, I can only advise to either stay away or be ready to request a refund if it has the same problems on your system."

Roll the now-colored cube onto a same-colored square to make it disappear.  Every square you roll across disappears, so pay attention to your path, because it matters.  The goal is to get all the colored squares to disappear, while leaving yourself a final path to the exit tile.It's a fun minimalist title, with 48 levels in all.  None are more challenging than a few minutes of trying a few different paths before you'll find the solution.  I was left wanting more, but what was here was solid.  The art is well done, the UI is pretty minimal, which is fine, since a game like this doesn't need much in terms of UI.Overall it's a fun indie title made by a single dev who got themself through Greenlight.

You can only move on a block once so you need to think about the best path to take before stepping out. You can always just go for it and it does work out sometimes but in the later levels planning out your path will help you beat it faster without guessing.For $2 this is a great game for puzzle lovers, only took me 2.2 hours to complete all levels so it's not crazy difficult but some levels were harder for me than others.The difficulty scaling is a little odd, I found myself stuck on a few late levels for a good 5 minutes trying to figure out all the different paths and just couldn't see the answer but that could be a fault of mine as the longer you look at something your brain tends to go over the same areas over and again and it makes it harder to see anything else but then the next level I do in 1 shot just by going the most logical path through each color.8/10- Quick, Challenging, Relaxing, $2, 100% Achievements, What’s not to like"
