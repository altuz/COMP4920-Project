76561198094496594,Not Recommended,454220,24123006,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,uh-huh,"Temporal Invasion certainly is worth getting if you are into sleuth, riddle-solving, and mind-boggling puzzles; as long as you can bear with the overly present grammar errors--which is ironic given that the game is text-driven, you would think that the studio would have allotted more resources to this aspect of the game. While the concept and premise of the game is great, it falls short on delivery. The game provides a nagging vibe of being an upgraded--or simpy ported--flash game with mediocre interactable interface, poor story line delivery, and a confusing plot which just happens to be all over the place.Pros and Cons:Intriguing but badly narrated plot riddled with grammatical errorsChallenging puzzles, albeit partly due to the language usedMulti-dimensional riddles (combination of decryption, word analysis, math, and tons of googling and wikis) but bad recognition filter for solutions (e.g. Abraham Lincoln will not be considered for Abe Lincoln)Low resolution images for clues (some of which were grabbed directly from the internet - hope no rights were infringed there)But if you got $2 and countless hours to spare, do get this game.

The store page said nothing about being only half a game - at least not when I bought it in July 2016. Halfway through I hit a wall that just said something to the effect of ""to be continued"".It is no episodic game. It is not on Early Access. The game is just unfinished. The developer promised to finish the game by August. It is now December and still no part 2 in sight.As for what it is: It is a decent puzzle game, where many solutions have to be googled. Try the MIT Mystery Hunt puzzle archives for puzzles in a similar style, but far more refined and complex."
,Not Recommended,454220,30515122,Posted: 14 March,all,euqil,"I finished first 2 of 10 chapters but I won't be coming back. This game should be right in my alley but I did not like it for several reasons.First problem was the clunky UI. It is competently made and looks good but there are several things that make the experience lacking. For instance you receive notifications for messages you've already read making you go back and forth between the screens. As the transition is not instant you are clicking around a lot for no reason. Adding sliders in image app for zoom instead of buttons would help. What I am missing the most is 'reply' button since the mailing app does not remember your email contacts. 'Copy to clipboard' button would not hurt either, especially since for some of the UV solutions you need to flip the image or copy a link.Biggest issue I had with puzzles where you have to respond with a string is the pattern matching. Without spoiling the concrete puzzles: for instance Louie and Louis are considered different even though it is supposed to be a test challenge and could as well be accepted. I assumed since that puzzle that the verification is pedantic but that was wrong. Case in point being that in other puzzle I tried several entries and variations on a middle name (initial, initial with dot, full middle name) but it turned out the correct answer was a name without the middle one. In some puzzles abbreviation is accepted but not the full writeout or the name of the place/location (school). Similarily name of a place was not enough in other puzzle, location and country was wrong as well, in the end the correct answer was name of a place and 'dessert' behind it.This issue is magnified by the fact that the verification of your input is not instant and you don't know if what you sent was correct so you just try a bunch of versions every time you send something. Match verification makes sense when you enter codes or passwords but all locations and names should have fuzzy match instead.Some of the UV light puzzles don't make sense - for instance when the UV is usable on the photo that was supposedly taken by the quest giver. I can live with that. In some of the puzzles it's not a problem to find a solution but rather figure out where to send it. New email contacts could just automatically be added to your email client - it feels like unnecessary busywork to type stuff out all the time.In a puzzle where password hint is in catalan (?) the answer is not the words in English which would make sense within the game. Not even in Catalan which would make sense in context of the puzzle. Not even in cyrrilics which would make sense in context of the answer. The answer is English transcription of Russian words. Odd. By that point I knew I just have to try all versions because I can't infer the solution from the game.In a puzzle where I was supposed to look on a website of an island that does not exist I went off to look around the site not knowing I have a new message in the game client. The problem is that if you want to run the game on one screen and search on the other you have to play with a borderless window but you don't have the option to have the game client take your whole screen so the game was minimized while I was trying to call a number on said website.Somehow all contact exist on the same domain even though naratively it does not make sense. The narrative was overall strange and could use some update. I would love to go on wiki binge across various subjects but the game did not feel like any of the tasks were thematically matching.Overall - good puzzle game should let you have the 'a-ha' moments. After you figure a solution you should be able to finish a puzzle in a straightforward way. With TTI I had to try bunch of different variation of each solution and that takes the moment from you. Naratively it makes sense that the email is delayed but when the IM is introduced it should be possible to send solutions through it where possible and get an instant reply.I suspect this was not playtested on an audience because these things would come up pretty fast.The price of 5EUR is fair if you manage to stick with the game but I had more fun with The Black Watchmen."
,Recommended,454220,24236165,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,CrazyCanuck,"OverviewDo you rememberMajestic? It was game from 2001 by EA, back when EA was still a decent publisher that didn’t pump out repetitive trash. It was basically an augmented reality game. It lasted maybe a year, as it was commercially a failure. But it utilized the real world to solve problems. You could work with other players. There were phone numbers you could call, and you could receive phone calls with clues. There were videos to watch, and full websites made specifically for the game. It wound up being pretty fun, and I had a blast with it.The Temporal Invasionreminds me ofMajestic. It’s far less interactive, in that you search for already existing information, and it utilizes a sandbox email and internet system (so no actual access is required), but it has all the makings of a pretty fun, albeit exceptionally hard, game.I’ve never had to use my brain as much as I did this one, nor have I had to confer and talk with people and work together as much as I have on this (not including obvious multiplayer games).The game starts you off easy enough, with a couple of very easy riddles that everyone will get, even if one of the events took place half a decade ago. But the difficulty ramps up quickly, requiring you to change the coloring of an image to find hidden symbols, which might be from a cipher last used in the Roman era, to then convert to English which will reveal the coordinates of a location, having you use Google Maps (or some other subpar mapping service) to find the location, to then finally provide the answer to Dr. Quantum, who is your main contact throughout the game.Puzzles, as partially explained above, will consist of: using a UV light, manipulating pictures, scrubbing audio, watching videos, translating ciphers (both real and fictional), figuring out non-typical alphabet systems, Wiki’ing, and more. Unless you’re a genius with an intimate knowledge of history, geography, cryptography, and television shows, you will be frustrated, but that frustration will pay off.ProsFun puzzle gameEasy puzzles still seem like you’ve overcome something, while hard puzzles will seem very rewardingA story that makes no sense, but in a good way, and encompasses many aspects (science, time travel, alternate history and more)A fair amount of content for the priceFor those who are into them: trading cards and easy achievementsConsFilled with many grammatical errors, which has actually prevented the game from telling you you’re correct, as it expects an answer that’s misspelled (the dev has acknowledged this and that the game will be updated)Some puzzles are just exceptionally difficult, with one relying on a cipher that has been unsolved for over a century, and some that are very, very obscureStory begins to unravel near the end of part one, and the last quarter of the game seems to be hard riddles just for the sake of being hard riddlesSummaryThe Temporal Invasionis a unique game. It gives you clues you need to find in the real world, to present to the game in hopes of figuring out just what is going on. The difficulty ramps up to the extreme not too far into it, and requires you to be either very knowledgeable in every subject the game touches on, or has you talking with people to figure out the clues.Even if not on sale, there is a decent amount of content for the price, part two is actively being worked on (as of this review), and the developer has said corrections are coming to the grammar to make it both easier to understand the clues, and less trial and error for accurate answers (also being worked on as of this review).It’s well worth your time. It is also a very small game, and one that should have no issue sitting on your drive should you take a break from it and revisit it a few days later, a week, or a month down the line.(I have not actually edited this review, but am simply updating it for the Steam Game Awards badge requirement)"

,Recommended,454220,24121985,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,repdetect0,"REVISED REVIEW:This game is GREAT for exactly what it is, and totally worth the price. The developers have been very attentive and have refined the game a bit since release, when I first played it. It was already very good, and the minor tweaks have made it even better. This game is VERY tricky, and it is not for the unintelligent, as it is honestly rather large, and it relies on some honed mental skills at times.It is a complete blast to play with friends, as you can spend a few hours or a day coming up with an answer to some of the harder cases. It's fun, educational, weird, and well thought out. Honestly, I admire the developers for such a mental game that they have created. In a sea of action genres, it is like an oasis. A beautiful, masochistic oasis...NO SPOILERS: (Original review)Okay, I was really amped for this game, then I got a bit skeptical with the delays, and I started playing it once it released. At first I thought ""Okay, cool concept, but this probably wont be too hard for someone like me."" The first few puzzles were a bit of a Tutorial, and implements some things you will be doing like research and photo examination. Not too impressive yet. Then the first real research hit, and I was impressed a little. By the 5th puzzle, I was very intrigued with some of the level of research I could see before me, and as the game progressed. Admittedly, there is probably not much replayability after you are finished, but I guarantee you will have learned quite a few things before it is all over. I am not very far into the game yet, but for the pricepoint, this is a recommend for people that want to figure things out on their own. If you just crib the answers, then this game will be a waste, but if you do the work yourself, it is very unique and enjoyable. Kudos to the developers, if you pump out new chapters on down the road, for a fair price, then I can see this game having some legs to stand on."

This scratches the itch for puzzle-solving that only games like The Black Watchmen could scratch and it does it at a fraction of the price (though admittedly it feels much less immersive due to the budgeting, no fake websites (just blogspots), cheesy writing, low res pics, pics taken from wikis, etc).I still would recommend it at this ridiculously cheap price point."

I've read many people have had issues with the grammatical errors, but really, it's not THAT bad, I can fully understand what is being asked of me and any errors that exist do not hinder the game play in any way. The puzzles are fun and challenging, however some may be a bit difficult for players who aren't familiar with basic cryptography.There's an interesting storyline which keeps the player engaged, and I've even learned a few interesting things along the way. Graphics are basic, but this isn't the type of game that requires anything more.So, to sum up- I would highly recommend this game to any player who enjoys a little mystery, a little conspiracy, some researching, and most of all, using their little grey cells.SO worth the small price being asked."

Being able to highlight and copy them from the ""chat"" app would be nice.I like the idea of this game, but anytime you rely on third party sources it's bound to mess up the game, and make it unplayable/unfun for people.This is the best of this type of game I've played, but that's not much of a compliment.

And it's not in early access either ! I don't get this policy. I feel mislead since I've just experienced a great deception : at some point (half-way) the game tells you ""yeah you're on the right path but be patient, we'll come back.. blabla"".. and from what I've just read it's been like that for ages (well, several months at least). A plague for achievements hunters..The background storyline feels unrealistic and is fuelled by conspiracy theories to a certain extent. I don't know if it's  some propaganda or if the writers are just making fun of these craps :?Besides, each riddle of the game is a real challenge and is quite fun to solve. You really have to look everywhere. It sometimes feels a bit repetitive and sometimes too tedious (exact spelling is really important whereas the game's grammar isn't always correct). It lacks some tools to be really enjoyable (like an intern search engine for example and a more reactive and interactive intern mailing software).Above all it lacks its second half !!I'd say the whole underlying idea is very good but the production could be better.

It definitely seemed like the puzzles got harder as you went, and especially in Case 4 of 5 they were very frustrating at seemingly arbitrary.  Even after cheating and getting the answers to some of them I still couldn't figure out how someone came to those answers.Overall this is a must buy for $5 if you enjoy these kinds of games.

But it's cheap and has a walkthrough guide.TL;DR -- It's worth getting, but don't expect to spend an evening (or several) playing it through. You'll probably start a puzzle and spend the next hour Googleing for possible solutions (or just setting it aside and mulling the problem over).I'm barely into chapter two and I have mixed feelings about this one. The price is cheap. There's  a bit of a quirky plot reminiscent of the stories like the X-Files. The puzzles are on the obscure side (there's a steep increas in difficulty after chapter one). You absolutely need to be googleing for leads during the game. The user interface is not well designed.There are a series of discrete puzzles (seems like close to 100) with a vague plot thread connecting them. You get a clue from your online contact and you might have to do some sort of image manipulation or other thing to decipher the clue. You'll probably need to check online for what the clue might mean. What could have made this easier is to cut and paste text from the game and use it in a browser window for the searching, instead of having to retype everything out.To solve a puzzle, you type the solution and send your contact a message through the faux computer desktop the game provides. The solution has to be exact, which is the frustrating part. Early in the game you have to wait a minute or so for your him to email you back and tell you wether you're right or not. Realistic but frustrating. There seems to be little tolerance for pattern-matching for the solution. It would be a little nicer to get something better than a yes/no on the solutions, like ""that was close, but can you give me X's more common name"". The reason is that the clues you find might only point in a vague direction to a possible answer to the puzzle, and it's frustrating to try loads of different dead ends before realizing that I should have typed in a person's given name instead of the name he's commonly known by.The bright side is that there is a full walkthrough in the Community Guides, and several people have play-throughs up on youtube. There's at least one puzzle that I had no idea how to solve, looked up the solution, and still had no idea how I was supposed to have gotten there."

,Recommended,454220,24123241,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,Arbitrarium,"The Temporal Invasion was released July 4, 2016 from indie developer Hybriona Labs on Steam. Currently, the developer only has a Windows version up, but promises iOS and Linux within the week. It's been on my Steam wishlist for a couple of weeks now, following some of the hype coming out of E3.I was pleasantly surprised and delighted by the quality of this game. The price point is an extremely reasonable $3.99 (on sale for $2.39 through 7/11).I occasionally play puzzle games like 100 doors or various hidden object games on my iOS devices while killing time, say, in an airport. So, when I got the email yesterday that The Temporal Invasion was coming up, I downloaded it with a subset of expectations that were wildly off course.Firstly, this game is hard. It more closely resembles a virtual treasure hunt of information throughout history than any puzzle games I've played lately. The game gives you a few sandbox tools, but is designed for the player to utilize external internet searches (or other resources, if you have them) to fact-find through multi-step complex riddles and produce an answer for each case that moves the player through the story.The premise of the story involves being contacted for help by the mysterious ""Dr. Quantum."" As the protagonist, you've already identified that occasionally your memories are out-of-sync with reality, but are completely unprepared to be whisked on a journey through the past and future to uncover the truth behind a massive conspiracy perpetrated by a mysterious group of scientists from the future.Actual graphics in the game are just what the screenshots in the post show, no flashy graphics or crazy cut scenes, but the story holds your attention and the difficulty level is phenomenal. Some puzzles are intuitive and you only need a google search or two to find where you're going, while others are positively confounding. As yet, very few hint posts or walkthroughs are up, so you're completely left to your own devices to work through the puzzles and riddles.There are a few rough points, a few puzzles have awkward wording that actually make the puzzles a bit harder and a couple of the puzzles took me a couple of read-throughs to figure out what piece of information was being asked for. There's not a lot of introduction in how the game works or what kind of research is expected alongside the game. That said, the intro quests do a great job of introducing you to some of the tools. Also, word to the wise, there's a ""Help"" button that would have been good to read before I launched directly into the game. Overall, I really enjoyed this game!(This review first appeared on my blog at:http://wp.me/p7E92j-32, where I post lots of reviews and game news, especially for indie games!)"

With that in mind...The main problem I have with the game is the fact the difficulty isn't balanced.  The puzzels don't prograssively get harder.  Instead hard puzzels and easy ones are (for the most part) mixed together.  There are some grammer problems but most have been corrected.  It doesn't take away from the gameplay.  As a warning: some of the puzzels in this game are brutally hard.  I'd recommend if you love puzzels, like reseaching, and have a lot of time to kill."

I thought that it was clever how you have to come up with your own idea's while combining it with your research skill to find the answers to questions. The game will have you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off from time to time when your trying to find something and you can't find it, but the feeling of satisfactory wonse you do find the answer is all worth it. I did a Let's Play of the video for thoughs who are interested in getting a rough idea of how to play and what your getting into with this game before you buy it. I'll put a link to it below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksy_mwEtTYI"

If you are into puzzles that require real research (Google will be very helpful), conspiracy theories and a bit of experimenting this game is for you. So far it's really, really good."

Im not one to care about grammatical errors, honestly it makes it seem more realistic because nobody checks their emails 5 times to see if there is a spelling error. I don't mind the low quality pictures, because it's not like you can go back in time and take another picture of an event that happened decades ago anyways.What I'm saying is, you should try out the game and not be picky about everything in it, it was made with unity, and it is 5 bucks. If I had to put a price it would probably be 15, but thats my opinion."

This game is not good. It's pretty much a flash point and click with an embedded sandbox they call ""your computer"", and a bunch of enigmas (or should I call them riddles?), that get increasingly more ""difficult"" as you go forward. The problem is: for a good chunk of the first part of the game, you don't have anything other than a photoshop thingy and a magnifying glass. Which means that you HAVE to alt+tab the sh*t out of the game to find clues on your actual browser and actual wikipedia, because their sandbox doesn't include a f*cking navigator. Which makes me wonder how this game can charge for something you can actually find for free in games like Ouverture Facile - on which the level is actually much, much higher. Go check it out kids, before you spend your hard earned money on a piece of half finished student project cr*p like this. Now it is quite fun, don't misunderstand me. But it's because I bought the game two days after it came out. Whenever this will become just a little more popular (if it ever does), all the clues will appear magically on google as soon as you try and research anything about those riddles, because you HAVE TO use real life Google. This will render the game obsolete and completely boring to play. I should add that the graphics are terrible, and that it looks like a free template of a pre-made webdesign, as it stays absolutely static and nothing happens.Tl;Dr: The game is for children between 8 and 13, above that age, stay far, far away."

76561198052184118,Recommended,454220,24192168,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Snooky,"A very fun puzzle game. I love it because you can pick it up anytime, do a few puzzles, and return whenever your brain needs exercising. I did Case #1 last night, and will dive into Case #2 today.A few small issues I have: Not all versions of the answer will be correct, so if you're sure, try different ways of spelling the same thing. (For instance, suppose the answer is Harry Truman. You might type Harry S Truman or President Truman, but they won't work.)Also, the instructions are written strangely, and are awkward to read -- like they've been translated into English, but not quite correctly. I guess you can pretend Dr. Quantum isn't a natural English speaker (perhaps Indian like the game makers), which would explain the grammatical errors. It can be misleading, though, when words aren't used precisely (which is not a good thing for a text-based game). If it gets updated or there's a sequel, I recommend hiring an editor."
