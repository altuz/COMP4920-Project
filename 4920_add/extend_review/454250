76561198119539166,Recommended,454250,32342657,Posted: 11 June,all,valerie,I was a Myst player and bought The Eyes of Ara because it looked similar.  I like it a lot - the environment is attractive and atmospheric.  The puzzles are difficult but not impossible - until the rectangular pictures with moving squares.  Having reached them and wasted a lot of time trying to make progress - I hereby give up!  The hints in the discussion did not really help either.  An expensive excercise as I can't really request a refund after playing for 6 hours.......  I would recommend the game with the warning that you may not be able to complete it.

Well, this Myst Snob enjoyed the heck out of The Eyes of Ara.  It has been far too long since I've experienced a game where the puzzles have not been dumbed down, and where I didn't want the game to end. What a beautiful homage to the Myst/Riven series and I applaud the creator(s). The graphics are stunning, the music is lovely, and the puzzles are just right.  Granted, a couple of them I would not want to repeat in future runthroughs (but the creator did listen to those who felt they were too difficult and put a really nice alternative solution in a patch). If you're jonesing for Myst-type games, and are chomping at the bit for Obduction to release, this is the *perfect* game to play in the interim; or at any time really. Am hoping that the creator will treat us to future chapters. Bravo!"

The progression from one area to the next is logical and clearly prompted, provided you're paying attention. But the puzzles, oh the puzzles. My brain hasn't had to work this hard playing a game since the Myst series. The benefit of this though, is that while some puzzles are frustratingly difficult to work out, there is a massive sense of satisfaction in completing a room, unlocking a door, and moving on to the next. Brilliance. Absolute brilliance."

Unfortunately, quite a lot of that was challenging me to find the tiny hidden hotspot.tl;dr: Difficult, pretty, well-written, and the pixel-hunting elements are mostly optional. Yes, you should buy it.Good things:* Contains a lot of very good, original puzzles, and is much harder than the demo would suggest.* Really, really pretty, and runs even on quite low-end PCs.* Superb writing. The characters, though not appearing on-screen, are charmingly characterised through the notes they left behind.* The game is divided up into five areas (although the first and last are very short), and you can't carry items from one area to another. This helps reduce the combinatorial nightmare that you might otherwise encounter from trying every object on every other object.* Similarly, hotspots become inactive once they've served their purpose, which saves you wasting time on puzzles that have already been solved.* If you don't like hidden-object nonsense, there are a few options you can turn on to make it a bit easier - making the cursor change when it's over a zoom-in spot, making collectible objects occasionally shimmer gold, and playing a chime when you enter a room with collectibles.* If you like hidden-object nonsense, you'll find plenty of it here, but it's almost all optional.Bad things:* ALMOST all optional. There is at least one mandatory puzzle that requires playing find-the-hotspot.* A common flaw in this type of game, but barely half of these puzzles have a good reason to exist. The in-game letters make a vague attempt to justify them - some were created as entertainment, for example - but unless your suspension of disbelief is particularly good, you will find yourself wondering why on earth you need to do all of this puzzle-solving just to make your way around a castle.* There are a couple of moments where an item I wanted was visibly reachable, but access was blocked by a table that could easily be climbed over, crawled under, moved, or squeezed around. This was annoying.* Some of the puzzles aren't that great; but there are enough hits that I don't mind the misses.Other things:* lake.kubilius has written a really good minimal-spoilers guide that will give you a hint to certain puzzles if you get stuck without completely solving it for you. It also lists the location of all the hidden collectibles.* Content warning for suicide. Not on-screen, though.* Arachnophobes may rest content in the knowledge that while this game is full of cobwebs, there isn't a single spider.On the whole, though, The Eyes of Ara is a very enjoyable game."

I'm probably a little slower in the head than most people because it took me over 30 hours to finish this adventure but......It was over 30 remarkable hours!There was only one part of the game for me that required looking up a cheat and that was a solar system puzzle thing which wrecked my mind completely. Even after looking up the cheat, I still couldn't figure out how in the name of anything holy that I could have ever figured it out. But, other than that mess, the rest of the game was intriguing. Every puzzle made sense and you always seemed to know what you had to do next.MAKE NOTES!Keep a pad and pen handy and make a ton of notes. Your welcome.When you are coming to the end of the game you will notice that you can just do the last puzzle and finish the game. Done. The End. BUT....You will realize that there were items that you probably missed during the game that you can go back and find 'if you want to'. And if you do, other little sections and puzzles open up for even more challenging enjoyment.One such puzzle that you don't have to solve is in the cellar. I won't go into any detail and spoil it for you but if you decide to take it on, you will probably be just at the point of getting a rope and stool to hang yourself from your ceiling fan. But when you DO solve it....Oh boy....More puzzles and areas open up.Anyway, I loved this game and it was Well Worth The Price of admission if you are an Adventure Game Loving Fan."
,Recommended,454250,30465503,Posted: 12 March,all,Welwood,"This game is a mixed bag. It's got some great puzzles, a compelling story and very good music. If you like ""myst"" types of games as well as ""click around a room to find items"" types of games, it's right up your alley.But the game does have some major design and playability flaws. For example, there are items that you find throughout the game, that at first SEEM like they're just additional parts, because you can go from area to area and your inventory is ""cleared"" each time you enter a different ""zone"" and you get a new set of these items to find, so you'd think ""ah, this is just completionist stuff that doesn't really count"". Until you get to the end of the game and realize that no, you actually needed all of those items. It's a design flaw that's startling to see because there's nothing indicating those items importance, as their permenance from zone to zone doesn't carry through, nor is it implied in the game play prior. If something is needed for the end game, make sure that the players understand that by carrying the total amount throughout the zones OR by making it so that you need to find all the items prior to moving on to the next area.Also, there are areas in the game that are VERY difficult to get to, and have quite a bit of build up to their opening, just to have absolutely no payoff whatsoever once you've made it inside. Looking at you ""Just Deserts""...all of that time and build up to open an area that's just devoid of any payoff whatsoever. Combine that with simple to avoid issues such as ""when you walk into a room, have the door you just entered from be BEHIND you in every instance, and you come to realize that this project has some very sloppy game design. (For example, there are many times you enter a room through a generic ""door"" just to be standing in the next area surrounded by doors, some in front, some behind, which one did you come in from? who knows!)Additionally, there are several puzzles that have absolutely no hints or clues within the game that would give a player any clue as to what to do or how they're connected. (eg-hallways statues)It seems as if there were two teams on Eyes of Ara, a room design team and a puzzle team, and some days those two teams didn't really communicate with each other.All of that being said, the game is quite good. The puzzles are difficult (some intentionally difficult, some because of the poor design choices) and the world is actually quite easy to lose yourself into. I found the puzzles to be more in-depth than games like ""The Room"" which, regardless of having easier puzzles, did have a much better puzzle solving gameplay.With The Room & The Room 2 you understood that if you couldn't figure out a puzzle, it was because you hadn't looked at it from every angle. With Eyes of Ara, if you can't figure out a puzzle, it's probably because the devs didn't include the hint or they put it in another zone that has no other connection to the zone you're currently in.Fun? Yes. Frustrating? Absolutely. Oh, and btw devs, take whoever designed the room that rewards the player with Just Deserts and beat them with a bag of oranges while screaming ""Reward players who jump through your hoops, you trog!""."

It was intriguing, challenging, and presented original puzzles that were not only logical but led you on thru the game the same way. A good amount of sound thought proceses had to be employed to them.I respectfully disagree with those who compare EoA with MYST in any but the most superficial ways.Where MYST had you ""playing detective"" (so to speak), You have to go around gathering info; then piece it all together; then see if your conclusion was right. EoA is a glorified game of Hide and Seek. Many of the ""puzzles"" are stupidly simple requiring little thought. Those that do require some ""brain-work"" rely mainly on going thru the different permutations. But what is most frustrating is running around and around looking for your last ""Hide and Seek"" piece with no hints or clues to guide you. For example: the stone faces around the what looks to be some kind of ""secret"" door.But what's got me really ticked is light bulbs. Have you counted the number of crates and boxes there are? 75 give or take at this point. Did you notice how many of those are labled with their contents? Exactly ONE! ""BULBS"", in big bold letters in the downstairs closet where you find a star.Question: When trying to turn on the light in the attic above the bathroom is it inevitable that you drop the bulb? The makers HAD to have known that could happen. Which is why they labled that ONE BOX SO BOLDLY so you'd remember. Right? WRONG! Scurry back down to get your bulb; click on the box and NOTHING HAPPENS! ARE YOU F@&KING KIDDING ME? What was the point of labling that one box with the ONE ITEM you would soon need? Or maybe the makers are just a bunch of sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s?And is there a point of gathering all those coins, photos, dolls, etc.? If not then my point of this being a ""Hide & Seek"" game is proven."

It certainly doesn't start smoothly with its clunky controls, but you get used to that.Then its very engaging first half gets muddied by an increasingly obtuse experience in the later chapters, due to lack of proper guidance against increasingly complex riddles, ultimately leading to a fair amount of guessing.Yet, it's still a decent and enjoyable package overall. The game's challenges and engaging design construct a compelling arrangement, a thoughtful blend of familiarity and creativity, sufficiently rewarding to warrant its full exploration.Full 3D environments are observed from a fixed point. Visually, the game looks alright, albeit perhaps a bit dated. Teleportation from point to point sometimes lands in unexpected angles that make reorientation more difficult than it ought to be, but you get used to that as well.The game constantly challenges the player with multiple threads at once, including lots of optional puzzles and collectibles, ensuring that there is always something to chase or solve. There is so much to do and see, in fact, that it may even be difficult to get back into it if you take long breaks in between play sessions without feeling at least a little bit lost.Solving puzzles require paying serious attention to details and taking down many notes from etchings, diaries, drawings, scribbles, sketches, book excerpts, posters, and tons of numbers scattered all over. An automatic log of meaningful discoveries would have been welcomed.PositiveSome very clever and satisfying puzzles with rewarding solutionsSimple inventory system is easy to useWell achieved sense of discovery and explorationLots of varied contentGenerally pleasant ambianceAudio cues inform when missed collectibles are still present in a sceneNegativeSome very obscure and almost unfair puzzles with arcane solutionsDisorienting controls and archaic navigationUnoriginal and forgettable story (eccentric uncle isolated in old mansion performs experiments; déjà vu)More consuming than relaxing for its genreCastle maps sold as DLC should really be included in base packageAs comparable games I still prefer by farThe Roomand its sequels, with impeccable execution and cohesive style, but this game is nevertheless a good addition to a serious puzzle lover's library. Just don't be surprised that you may need a guide to reach its conclusion."

The artwork and ost is supurb with plenty of ingame options to adjust settings. I am 7 hours in on the 3rd floor.. I'd say i am about 75% of the way in the game at the time of this review, and still lots to discover. The puzzles can be quite tricky, however the hints are there. Many puzzles require a sort of out of the box way of approaching them. They often require backtracking through rooms or triggering a button/item combo of some sort. It has a unique twist on some classic puzzles. Lots of astrology related themes, but it fits in well.Lots of side stuff to do and optional items to find on your journey, the photographs and coins for example have kept me searching very closely, and even still i miss them because of how well they are hidden.Cons:Controls - The mouse controls should be improved, and the inverted mouse should be optional. This took time getting used to, the nice thing is you can adjust the speed to your liking.Picture Puzzles - There are 3, they ALMOST ruined the game for me and are very tedious to solve, You can see the solution, but getting to it can take a lot of time and seem annoying.Notice - There was a recent update that added a skip feature for the puzzles, the developer is working hard on updates. I will keep folks posted.Books and Papers - The text needs to be more legible even under the fully zoomed mode via scrolling the mouse wheel.Is it worth the money? - I definitly got my $14.99 worth and am sucked into this game, i even bought a copy for a friend of mine since it was his birthday today. Despite a few difficult puzzles, they make the game. You really have to look carefully and think outside the box for many of them.I recommend this to any avid puzzle/adventure fan, the dev is very active and works quickly to fix bugs. I look forward to the next game he comes out with."

You move around, click on suspicious objects and locations, collect items and combine/use them on others. There are plenty of puzzles, clues and secrets to be found in The Eyes of Ara as well as a number of collectibles that are usually very well hidden - an open eye is really a good asset in this game because there is a lot of hidden stuff you will miss if you don't scan every corner of every room.The graphics are alright but very samey - you are in the inside of an old castle though so that is fine. The atmosphere is pretty good and the background story is also somewhat interesting, though the ending falls a little short in my opinion. Puzzles are usually very challenging, though there were a few puzzles (especially towards the end) that I found way too hard/where I found the solution to be way too ""out there"" and like 2 or 3 ""picture puzzles"" that take simple luck and trying out endlessly to solve without much strategy or finesseEDIT: The developer now built in a function to ""skip"" these picture puzzles by finding a secret code. Very nice and a very responsive developer that really deserves his game being bought. Instead of just making them completely optional, he just makes you able to solve a different puzzle which is how it should be.The game takes you about 10 hours if you take your time and try to find all the collectibles and secrets. It is well worth the investment even at the full price if you are a fan of games like Myst or puzzle games in general.Very much recommended!"

You must explore a castle and find the source of a strange signal coming from within.  This signal is disrupting everything in a 100km radius including TV, Radio, and WiFi so it's imperative that you succeed.  However, it soon turns into a mystery, “the mystery of the Eyes of Ara”.  What are they and why are they there?Pros:Decent graphicsMany areas to exploreGreat mix of puzzles from easy to challengingThe developers are actively updating and answering questionsThe game flows well from puzzle to puzzleMany secret areas and roomsA great deal of collectiblesMysterious Story-lineCons:Point and Click formatA great deal of pixel huntingFairly LinearI thought that most of the puzzles were clever and challenging.  A few were easy while one or two were very hard, but the vast majority were well balanced.  You must pay attention to detail, many of the hot spots are well hidden forcing you to pixel hunt, however, once a puzzle is solved or an item found, the hot spot goes away letting you know that there is nothing further to discover.About the only thing I didn't like about this game (other than pixel hunting) is the fact that, strictly speaking, this is a point and click game.  There is no free roam that will allow you to go into a corner and see behind something.  Your character is rooted in the same place in every room.  There is only two or three exceptions where your position is slightly changed so be aware and alert.At the time of this review, The Eyes of Ara was selling for $14.99.

So many adventure games have you running around all over the place trying to find things and beating your head against the wall trying to figure out what to do next.  This game provides just the right amount of difficulty...at least for my personal taste.  Not so easy that you don't really have to think at all and not so difficult that you grow frustrated and no longer care to continue or worse have to resort to a walkthrough.Beyond that, my hat is off to the developer for creating a stunningly beautiful play environment.

It avoided the tedious current trends of supernatural horror and violence.> I had time to figure things out.  There was no urgency or deadline to solve the puzzles or game.  I hate to move at someone else's speed and not my own.> I could wander back and forth in puzzle spaces.  Some games close off puzzle areas once you progress in the game.  This game does not leave any area off limits once you leave it.> I could go back after completion to find things I've missed or wanted to look at again.Dislikes:>  Some areas were hard to get to as you could only be in one specific spot to to go there (e.g. I could see a table around the corner in views A, B, and C but couldn't inspect it unless I was in view C).  This made me think some areas were not available for inspection when they really were.>  I wanted to be able to go into more areas and look at more of the building (call me strange but I really wanted to open that refrigerator).  Perhaps this is a testament to the developers as they made the spaces interesting and inviting to browse.>  I see that a Halloween version was released but was not available when I purchased the game in February.  What a lost revenue opportunity for the game developers.Overall - if you like quietly figuring out fun and unique puzzles while in an interesting game environment, this is the game for you.  I want more!  Can't wait for the developers' next game."

The game is a good length, which is usually by biggest complaint of these kinds of games. Sometimes they can seem to overstay their welcome, but this game did not. It's also pretty bug-free.I didn't need a guide for the puzzles, as while not necessarily intuitive, the more difficult ones tend to be sufficiently explained or hinted at in hidden documents. Although I do sort of wish there was some kind of system to catalogue all the documents you find, so you can reference them later when you need them, as I was pretty well forced to take screenshots of everything I found and awkwardly sort through them later.The real test of my patience was with the collectables though. I did end up resorting to a guide for some of those.  Finding all of them can be a real pain in the sense that you'll be spending a lot of time ""pixel hunting"", or scanning every nook and cranny in every room trying to find very subtly hidden items.My last nitpick is with the choice of engine-- Unity. I've never bought a unity game that supports exclusive fullscreen mode, only a borderless windowed fullscreen. This game is no exception, so that means no FreeSync support, nor VSR. But the game is lightweight enough that I was fine with just regular old vsync. The game rarely dipped below my screen's refresh rate of 144Hz, especially after I turned off DoF and AA.I found the story interesting, plus the history of the characters was nicely layered. Although, it's all told through journals haphazardly laying about, so be prepared to read everything. There isn't really any narrative driven cutscenes or voice-overs. I was okay with that though.Overall, a nice little gem of a game. It's definitely priced right, IMO."

It did a great job of making me feel clever by offering smart hints, forcing me to really make use of a physical notepad to keep track of clues and hints, which I loved! All throughout, the puzzles were constantly inventive and fun. It was rare that I had to look up hints online, though a few specific puzzles (especially one involving three levers) got a bit too vague for me.Still, absolutely worth your time. $15 for 6-7 hours worth of puzzles (maybe more, maybe less depending on your solving speed!) is well worth it in my book, especially with the quality of storytelling, puzzle design, graphics, and music this game has on offer as an indie release."

The puzzles stopped being challenging and became much more obscure, and the solutions didn't always make sense. They also became very non-linear which got extremely overwhelming. Some of the puzzle logic got pretty thin.There's a couple of puzzles that aren't really deducable, but are instead a huge time sink of fiddling with matching pictures up. I much prefer a riddle that needs to be solved. Also, I would have appreciated the option to keep codes and notes in the inventory so that they are easier to refer to later, instead of relying on memory or taking hard-copy notes.Unfortunatly the game got so irritating in the last third that I was just waiting for it to end, instead of being interested in the conclusion.

None of these steps felt connected in any way and I often felt that the game was either very blatantly signposting what I had to do or it was not giving me any indication of what to do next. Overall most of the puzzles were either too easy and gave no sense of achievement for completing them, or were too difficult due to the various steps to complete a puzzle being to disconnected from each other. My frustrations were furthered by the fact that there were seperate puzzles focused around collectible but these were hard to distinguish from the main puzzles which resulted in me spending excessive amounts of time on a puzzle to only recieve a blue orb (Collectible) at the end of it.Furthermore I found that certain points of interest were easy to miss due to the cursor indicator zone being very small for them, some times I would be stuck on a puzzle due to the fact that i had missed a clue or object that easily missed without mousing over the screen very carefully.Not terrible but not compeeling enough for full price, wait for a sale."

I have been disappointed by recent games of a similar vein, but The Eyes Of Ara delivers on several of the fronts on which those fell flat.For example, in multiple-step puzzles there is no obvious locking-in of each step, it all locks in at the end, so you can't just fiddle around until the puzzle solves itself. Although this makes it trickier, I find it much more gratifying.Another big problem in point-and-click adventures is that when you get stuck you can end up retracing your steps and clicking on every inch of screen space, hoping to interact with someting. TEoA zooms in on important areas when you click them, but not once you have already exhausted that area. This takes a lot of the frustration out of searching for bits you may have missed.These seem like finickity points, but it's the little details that make for an engaging experience which has managed to cut some of the irritation from the point-and-click genre without feeling like the player is being coddled."

I started a new game and went through about 1/2 of Act 2, and the ""hidden chime"" has really made a difference to me.  It's not perfect (it doesn't help you with some extra hidden achievement stuff), but I now have no problem recommending this game.  It's clear the developer has been working hard to improve the experience, and I say they succeeded.  Original unedited rview follows:This was a very difficult decision, but ultimately I'm going to mark Eyes of Ara as ""not recommended"".   I put about ten hours into this game, and decided to quit playing in area three (four if you count the tutorial).  The puzzles were good, fanatastic in some cases, but the developers relied way way (way way way) too much on pixel hunting.  I would say a good four of my ten hours were spent scouring every corner looking for the half-hidden items, some of which were necessary to progress.  It basically became no fun after a while, and after I learned thatthere's some backtracking for collectibles, that finally broke me, since I had wasted an hour already looking for the last thing to make the thing work.If the developers ever add some sort of indication that you're not done, like say a marker that tells you if you've found all the interactibles in an area, for example, then I'd probably finish the game and change my vote.  But right now, I just can't  play pixel hunt any more.Edit:  Steam says 7.7 hours, but my save file in game says ten, if you're wondering at the difference."
