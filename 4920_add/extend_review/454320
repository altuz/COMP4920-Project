No need for over the top art, comples stories (that are waste of development time) or anything that is not related to the puzzles themselves. Pure, simple logic, now that's my kind of game."
76561197988012862,Recommended,454320,23993484,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,mendel,"First impression: solid graphical programming/factory puzzle gameTake a grid, add a machine that produces objects and one that accepts objects, and a toolbox of other machines that can move the object or other machines, or make the other machines go the other way, etc. You need to build a factory line that moves the objects to where they need to go.So far, I played 30/48 levels. This machine looks like an easier version ofSpaceChem- it is less complex, but the impression of ongoing 2D processes timed to work with each other (if not, everything crashes) is the same. Both games will get you to think in terms of processing, which is a prerequisite to programming.From time to time, you will earn hint points that you can use to reveal module positions on the board when you're stuck for an idea; I had to use that once so far. The level design is excellent.It's a steal at the sale price, and a good value otherwise. Recommended.This game runs a little sluggish on my old Windows XP computer, and is fullscreen only."
,Recommended,454320,24039098,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Soltanis,"[the Sequence] is a pure logic puzzle, similar to the game SpaceChem.The graphics are clean and music and sound effects match the aesthetics of the game.The puzzles, start at a good pace, introducing you to the various mechanics and abilities of the pieces or modules as they are called.The game then takes a steady increase in difficulty adding in the remaining modules and obstacles.Each module has an easy to access help menu which describes and animates the function of the module.As I played I found myself wanting to always finish the next level and this is a good thing, as many logic puzzles tend to leave a feeling of repetitiveness.I would have liked to see the game nudge the player to understand that modules can also interact with modules, this is however clearly stated in the modules help area, I still feel such a essential piece of information would have benefited from a little highlight.The game itself is clearly designed for a vertical view area and leaves a lot of screen space bare on desktop, but the game works and I'm not sure I would change the view either,Unfortunately, remnants of it's mobile existence remains in the form of a ""rate the game"" button that opens a browser to the Apple Store, rather than it's steam page or a landing page on the developers website.In conclusion this game is a perfect addition to any Logic Puzzle lovers playlist."
,Recommended,454320,24162503,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,kurath,The concept is incredibly straightforward - this is a simple logic puzzle with a handful of different components to arrange to get an object from point a to point b. Where the Sequence seems to stand out - and this is a very important point because a good concept with poor execution is not worth it - is that the level design is excellent. Each level looks like its had thought put into it to require a new frame of thought from the rest which is great.A lot of puzzle games advertise the number of puzzles they have but many of them are grinding out the same solution - this is not one of those games.

,Recommended,454320,24102357,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Cyril,"Pretty neat little game. For $2 (or $.49 which I paid on sale) you get 72 programmtic-logic style puzzles involving moving an object from point A to point B using various tools at hand. The puzzle design is tight and slick most of the time, only a few cases of really weird/obtuse solutions and as well a few puzzles I feel like I found an easier solution than the intended one, but on the whole it's a good challenge. It also has a fair hint system that guides you to an answer without directly telling you anything. And there's a lot of content, the first 48 puzzles are basically a long tutorial for the 24 core sequence puzzles that make up most of the real challenge, but the difficulty curve throughout is smooth. The presentation is solid too, simple graphics and only one music track (that I eventually muted) but it looks fine enough for what it is. Really can't complain about much here other than that reorganizing sequences felt a little clunky the way it was done, but I'm not sure there's a better way either, so... eh. Still, good little logical puzzle game, definitely."
,Recommended,454320,32129566,Posted: 2 June,all,Azure Flash,"Gameplay: Placing and configuring little modules to move a dot from one point to the other. Very programming-like.Content: The modules cover all of the bases: moving in a line, rotating, turning on and off, changing directions... I wouldn't be surprised if this was a complete enough language to simulate a computer given enough modules and a big enough playing field.Interface Design: It's a little cumbersome to drag things into place, then click on them to configure them, then click on buttons to rotate or change the polarity. I also found a bug where if you press Esc during a simulation and come back to the level, the level stays as it was during the simulation instead of resetting to how you placed them. I also found there wasn't enough difference between the three simulation speeds.Sounds: Pretty simple atmospheric music and subtle, not too tiring SFX.Visuals: Nice clean minimalistic look, the module symbols are pretty good at visually representing what they do.Style: What I love about this game is that it teaches you to use modules in a ""dirty hack"" kind of way, creating delays in order to make everything work together in synchronicity. There are also times when you have to use synergy between two modules placed a certain way. Made me have quite a few ""Ah-ha!"" moments and I felt pretty clever!Annoyances: All the things I mentionned in Interface Design, probably a syndrome of being a mobile port. Nothing deal-breaking though.Value: Very fairly priced game, though there's a limit to the premade puzzles it's a very well put together programmy puzzler!Replayability: A little bit with the Sandbox mode but it's a fairly short game (I'm halfway through as of writing this)... unless you get stuck I suppose, which could still happen to me!"

It reminds me of cellular automata. You could do similar things in Infinifactory (move movers), but usually Infinifactory puzzles involve just moving the resource blocks, not the movers themselves.Wholeheartedly recommended, especially if you're into logistics puzzlers (Infinifactory, Spacechem and such)"
76561198126592129,Recommended,454320,22389173,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,StereoCat,"Awesome puzzle game!It starts pretty easy, but it gets more and more complex and you progress and at some point you really have to think hard to solve the puzzles. The basics are simple, you have a couple of modules you can use in order to move a white dot from the start to the finish, but the amount of things you can do with those simple modules is incredible, and the levels are really really well designed to make you think hard and figure out all of the possibilities.On the design side, the game is beautiful and the sounds are really good! One complaint would be that the interface isn't adapted for horizontal screens. The game started as an iOS game and so it looks like you have an iPad in the middle of your screen. The different buttons could have been place on the sides to leave more room for the actual level, which could have taken more space on the screen. It would be nice also if the game would detect the screen orientation so it would rotate if you want to play it vertically on a Windows tablet. It'd be nice if they could add controller support also. It shouldn't be too hard and it would work great with a controller since the game is a grid with simple controls.Talking about tablets, the game works great on a touchscreen! I added the ""Touch-Friendly"" tag to the game, but more people need to add it for the game to be officially tagged as touch-friendly, so if you have a minute, please add the tag so this game gets more visibility for people playing on tablets!This game is freakin' amazing. If you like puzzles that really make you think, you can't go wrong with this one!"

,Recommended,454320,24092052,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Kafro Hudrep,"[the Sequence] is a logic puzzle game based on placing modules to move things from one place to another. It is similar to SpaceChem in feel and design, but much less complex, which for me is a good thing because man did that game get a bit too involved at times.There are a few quality of life issues that could easily be fixed. First, even on the fastest speed, playing your sequences can still take a very long time. This can be rather irritating when you're trying to test minor variations of a solution repeatedly. Second, fiddling with module properties like polarity and sequence timing could have been easily improved with adding the option to use right click and mouse wheel, but instead you have to manually go into each module's submenu to get that done. Lastly, when you finish all the levels, you're greeted with a congratulations screen that says ""Click to continue"", but it doesn't actually work and apparently has not for at least a year and a half according to the discussion forums. Kind of ridiculous that whatever ending, how minor it may be, is completely inaccessible and will probably remain that way forever.Nonetheless, this is still a great game and its puzzles will likely keep you thinking long enough to far more than justify its already inexpensive price."
