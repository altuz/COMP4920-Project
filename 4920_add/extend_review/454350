If you like Day of Defeat Source, just stick with that. Gameplay is better and it is much less resource intensive."

After taking away ads they suggest if you want ads, to just go play another game.Taking away a game mechanic like ads is absurd if you think its going to help build your playerbase. You have no playerbase the way it is. I'd suggest listening to your community rather than thinking you know whats best for your game. With how poor the game is turning out in regards to your playerbase, I'd say its clear you don't know what is best.I pay for your game and you tell me to go play another game because you don't want to listen to the feedback of your community.

I personally know at least 10 people who pledged money to the game, and curretnly 26 of my Steam friends own the game. With each update, the devs are pushing towards a WW2 version of CSGO, which is not the direction they said they would be taking during the Kickstarter, or the initial release of the game.

,Recommended,454350,29750136,Posted: 6 February,all,|$m0k!n|-4HUD-,"Not much of a recommendation, really. Quite the contrary.I am trying really hard to like this game, but I am constantly failing. I keep trying, but damn..I would not recommend this game at the current price for any other reason than to revitalize your interest in whatever game you think that this game should be the spiritual successor of. For my part I feel that this game is lightyears away from the Day of Defeat: Source I know so well. Even though this is Early Access it has been in devopment for more than eight months and considering what state it's currently in it doesn't bode well for any near future.The game is fugly, dark and clunky as hell. Tons of features missing to qualify this game as the successor of anything. Lots of clunky stupid and stuttering animations. Weird physics. Clunky gameplay. Extremely unbalanced weapons - someone on the dev team really hates Assault and Support. Very few and fugly maps and low res textures on everything. Everything seems to be on the same colour palette - I have huge difficulties telling wallpaper and players apart. Lots of inexplicable deaths. Tons of one-shot kills. Protected by neither VAC noranti-cheat- they've recently added EasyAntiCheat, but it remains to be seen what effect that has.I've actually upgraded my gfx in order to play this game at the best quality in a reasonably fluent way, but there are some extremely bad design choices at work that makes adding what little quality this game has to offer much more of a punishment than an improvement in any way (you can add fog and lush terrain full of grass and bushes, but it will only obstruct your own view and it doesn't provide you any cover, because you'll be the only one that see it.. That's kind of lame.)I would suggest that you check back in a few months to see what the reviewers think of this game, because unless you are interested in taking an active part in the development of this game, like providing feedback and suggestions, there is very little to do with it.Some very loud people say DoDS is dead, but just take a look at this to see how DoW compares:http://steamcharts.com/cmp/300,454350(DoDS is Green, DoW is Blue). DoW - Deader than dead. :("

I was fully torqued for this game, bought it as soon as it was available. Played numerous seasons in both DoD 1.3 and DoD:S across multiple leageues and LANs. The devs promised a game that would have the competitive community at the forefront. After a few subpar patches it became clear that is not the direction they are going. Balance patches over compensate for minor problems (added way too much recoil to rifles and basically NO recoil for assaults). Don't be surprised when the $30 DLC is called Nights of War and there are pitch black maps where you have to have dedicated torch bearers. Stay away unless you only want to pub a mediocre WW2 shooter."

Lots of promises and I noticed that the devs actually improved things.A frew months later they ♥♥♥♥ed up everything. Modified the maps, added INVISIBLE WALLS so you can't jump anymore to specific spaces which makes the game feel like you're playing in f'ing tunnel. And it would be fine if they were improved recoil, sound and animation glitches and made the jumping mechanic better. But no. They made everything worse.And in the end, THEY REMOVED IRON SIGHTS.This game is dead to me now.

Days of War if built in the Unreal Engine 4, which makes the game really user and community friendly.Its a WWII shooter with oldschool standards: no bull****, you can't drop bombs with your ipad while taking a dump, can't ask for killstreaks nor health regen or any of those crutches. THANK YOU.Its a class based shooter where you fight in a wide variety of maps/environments and its mostly about skill and team work. This game in on early access but feels really polished. The developers will give full mod support, incluing a level editor, free dedicated servers and complete steamworkshop integration.It will only get better."
,Not Recommended,454350,29500495,Posted: 26 January,all,Pixy,"I had high hopes, from videos to the message from the Dev. team it looks too good to be true!It was,at least for now. I will say that it has buckets of potential! I loaded it up and set my settings,sadly frame-rate was a bit of an issue; I am sure it will be addressed soon enough. Then I move on to a server, I like that there is a browser, I dont know if you can have your own servers, but I would love to see this as a feature!I load into a game and I take my first shot at the Allies landing on Omaha beach and BAM! Headshot on an Allie before he can come out of the trasport!  Saddly the only way I knew I killed him was from the kill feed, I don't need much feedback but a little bit would do wonders. This is a game after all, I will say that when I shot people in close quarters and see blood spray it really felt great as a form of feedback; along with the ragedoll!While playing I noticed the lack of depth in the sound of weapons and footsteps, I couldn't tell where anyone was comeing from other then my map knowledge. I really think the sounds need to receive some TLC in the fact that they sound tinny and more like toy guns rather than killing machines. Reminds me of pop guns :) This leads me to the Maps, there are only 4, and 2 modes.  I just feel that for the price I would love to see a reasonable amount of content added at a fair pace. I worry about the user base to be found wanting due to pice range. I feel a lower start price might lead to a more robust user/fan base.I know that a map builder is in the works, unsure when it will be included, but I hope that they allow for ease of user content publication withing the server list. I would love to see larger map sizes also because I felt they were a little on the constricted side or very basic, and anyone who plays FPS knows that map design is essential! ( please no doughnuts!!!!)Overall I can't recommend this game int he current state, but I would high advise thoes that are keen, keep an eye on this one!!Pros:PotentialNice weapon profiles - different recoils and suchGood texturesCons:Un-optimised (for less powerful PCs may see FPS issues hindering gameplay)Very sparce on content (ie 4 maps, sound,interativity)Sound design and quality could use some workPrice = low starting player baseGames are shortUnclear objectives and markingsOverall the game could use a bit more definition just for the short term to provide better satifation of a game from start to finish. Just a few little details could make it feel a lot more finished while the rest of the major content is being developed. Interactivity would be a nice touch but not a necessity (ie wood deteriation, cover object destruction). Private servers would be a boon  with ability to set different parameters and build community that is often lacking in larger games! Turely a game and dev team with much more than meets the eye!Thank you!Edit: The FPS has been looked at immediatly by the team...which is nice. I will say it is a little less of an issue but I will keep a warning for thoes with lesser PC spec.I will say after playing furter and after placeing against others, this game still has promise. For $25 it is still an non-recommended game. The price is too high and the few maps and map quality are lacking. The sound and game feedback would be nice to see as their next goal to help in the short term but I am not as up to date on their road map as others.I would say seeek out other games if you want an immediate fulfillment in this genera, there are a few to choose from that are in a more playable state!Please do keep an eye out for this in the future, I am sure in time it will become what its meant to be.Thanks"

This is how clueless they are on basic gave development. I get that this is their first game, but I don't really think copyright is a novel idea in 2017. These devs are so clueless and disinterested in their own game, that they begged everyone in discord to go and write positive reviews to counteract the negatives ones, instead of accepting responsibility for producing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, it's everyone elses fault for not liking it.If they completely 180 on development and stop catering to realism and casual players then this game could turn around.

And...the mini map/objectives. (Can't live with it.) Your team mates are very hard to distinguish in close quarters and the mini map is hard to read.A Solid start, although if you are looking for a change of pace from normal FPS such as I am it's a mellow tone and compairs very identicly with other WW2 shooters that follow simalure rules."

The sound design is also a bit dissapointing with a lot of the weapons sounding weak. One that especially dissapointed me to the point where it was annoying is that the M1 garand has the shortest and quitest clip ejecting sound I've heard in any game with an M1.

It is a simple screen keeping it to the essential. Reminded me of CODUO. As always I checked the options menu first.Graphics were preset to High/Ultra which later proved to be the right settings for a stable framerate. (GeForce GTX 960, i5-6600, 16 GB DDR4).Controls were missing somethingessential- there is no leaning left or right! Why? This is something I was hoping for to get my classic FPS feeling.Joining DominationFirst round was on Carentan and first I realized how unclear the HUD is in telling you were the objectives are. Capturing flags. The flags really blurr with the environment so that you won't be able to see them at first. It took me a while - but I might have been just blind.The game mode itself is not really innovative, nothing new.Joining DetonationOmaha Beach. Wonderful. A map made and re-made over and over again. Nothing innovative. Americans spawn in clear sight, so Germans can just turkey hunt them easily from the bunkers. The way from the beach to the bunkers is rather short, but there is enough time to really let them have it.This leaves me with the verdict of not trusting Driven Arts for their mapping and balancing knowledge.The game mode - again - is something we've all seen. Why didn't you bring back headquarters? Why didn't you think outside the box and make something new? Copy and paste was the deal.GameplayAll of the above wouldn't be as bad IF the gameplay wasn't weird. It starts with the missing lean function, includes the ""smeary"" ironsights mode (meaning a delay on moving your mouse) and ends with player movement itself, which feels like dragging your feet through mud.You can hipfire with brutal accuracy. Against what was promoted.Sound effects of guns are atrocious, Germans have the American voice output and on Omaha someone was constantly screaming that the bomb was planted.One is being blinded by some bloom effect you can't turn off.You can scream ""IT IS EARLY ACCESS"" as much as you want. This product was advertised as something different as what it is now. It will not change in its weird and blurry core.So, my first impression was just bad.P.S.: ♥♥♥♥ing spray show."

The few maps in the game are basically laid out like Pacman, charging down narrow lanes, an enemy camping at the other side. There is no flanking, no teamwork, and too many one hit kills. Just a lot of fighting over corners.I commend what the dev team is attempting and encourage them to keep up their work. I simply cannot enjoy the game in its current state.

The game is horribly scripted, and the UI is garbage. The configuration settings are disparaging. There's an uneven balance between mouse sensitivity, and aimed moust sensitivty which makes it hard to transition between the two in combat, even with the different sensitivity settings. The graphics feel like I'm playing Warhammer Online back in 2008 but in a WW2 FPS setting. The combat is boring. Shotguns have no place in the game, and ruin the experience of the closed in maps. What few good fire fights/exchanges I had were non ironsighted with a bolt action rifle. The grenades/explosives feel like you're throwing fireworks.I don't have much else to say except I hope nobody wastes their money on this game for another couple of years. I understand its early access but that doesn't excuse the awful decision for the devs to release this game in the state it is.

The game is still in development and you help them financially and (depends on you) report bugs etc. to them, if you buy the game.Now to the overall Review:Handling of the weapons - it works fine as it is now. Only the nades could need some polishing.Atmossphere - The atmossphere is overall very good. The light, dust, weather, fog. Works pretty well together.Mechanics - The game-mechanics work as they should, mostly and most of them.Options - There is even now a wide variety of options to modify the game to your liking, or the liking of your PC-Setup.Performance - I think this is something that could be improved for the future. It works fine for me, but I heard others have problems with an overall equivalent Setup.But for me (and seemingly for others too) there is one big problem: The Ping. Even if the Server shows, that it has a 30ms Ping, when I join I have a 100-300 Ping. On almost every server. For comparison: In others games I have a 50 ping at max on European servers. But I'm looking forward that this will be looked at pretty soon.The game itself ISN'T finished and you'll notice it. No problem, it's in early access. But nonetheless the game has great potential. If the devs keep it up it'll surely be the spiritual successor of DoD:S. Also I'm looking forward to the Realism-Mod, that will hopefully come soon."

Don't go hate on me xDAfter investing some time into the game i understand why this has ""mixed"" user reviews and heres the full detailed review of my experience!Since im a CS:GO player i have to mention that this game is build in a different way than counter-strike. You have to aim, find cover, kill and repeat. Since u can kill pepole using  only a fev bullets, it makes it hard to survive long!At start its very hard to get used to, i (when i started) only got 5-10 kills per 20-30 min game. But when i stated to re-play the maps and used the guns ive got better with, im now usually getting 20-30 kills per game (avrage score).Basically you have to play this game a bit before you can get better at it.This is the biggest reason why this hasmixeduser reviews; pepole start playing it and suck and right after that they post a review that the game sucks- wich is wrong!PROS:* Addictive* Has nice graphics* Great/Historical MapsSimply, its all what day of defeat is but improved and better version!CONS:* Kind of Bugged* Unbalanced* ExpenciveThis game has alot of bugs. Since its early acess, its forgiveable, but wich isnt is that its unbalanced (at OMAHA theres literally like 100 campers killing you instantly) and the game itself is a bit too expencive.  Now they have droped the price about 5€ since it was released, but since it is built on Unreal 4 engine it does not have good enough graphics for it (all doe they are better than some games [COD4]) and at this stage it is right now, it should not be more than 16-19€ (25€ right now)FEATURES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE* Leaderbord* Ranking system* Competitve plays (not like CS:GO has)* Option to Vote Stuffleaderbords; - would be awesome to see what are ur stats (how many kills/deaths uve done, wich are u globally [Example: 118 on the leaderbord] etc.)Ranking; - would place better pepole against eachother and starters and soo on to the pepole they actualy have change to beat. As for me it took some time to get used to die by the pros all the time, so a similar ranking system like CS:GO has, would be great.Competitive plays; - would be awesoem to have a feature to have offical maps made for rounds and plays against [example: 10v10 palys] other players. Its something that Battalion does and would be aweosme to see it in here aswell.And last but not least - Voting;- if someones afk -  the kicking option, if someone needs to go - timeout option and soo on.At the moment i think its one of the best FPS WW2 shooters out on steam and u should give it a try. But as from as much ive seen, battalion is the one to go."

76561198007445384,Recommended,454350,29575888,Posted: 29 January,all,~TAB~ NinjaWJ ★,"This is my first review on Steam. I bought Days of War hoping that it will scratch the old-school FPS itch ii have been having. Days of War reminds me a lot of the old Call of Duty 1 and Call of Duty 2 games I have played as a teenager. Currently, the game is in Early Access stage. I have played nearly ywo hours and would like to give my first impressions. This review will be updated as more content gets added.PerformanceI am having smooth framerates with no performance issues. However, I understand other users are having issues. Since the game is in Early Access, I believe it will be further optimized later on.GraphicsGame looks good. The scenery and environment looks detailed. However, there are some inconsistencies. The ground textures and trees look bland and blurry, as well as the weapons. Shadows are too dark in some spots. I don’t really care too much for graphics in a game, so this portion of my review will be shortGameplay – WeaponsIn an FPS, weapons are a crucial part. It is important the the weapons “feel” right, sound good, and in multiplayer, balanced. Currently, the weapons in Days of War need some improvement. There are about 20 weapons in the game, ranging from bolt-action rifles like the Kar98k, to submachine guns like the M1 Thompson.The weapon variety is definitely a positive. You will be able to use iconic German and American weapons. Americans get access to the Garand, Springifled, Thompson, BAR, shotgun, M1 Carbine, and several other weapons. Germany gets access to the K98k, Mp40, MP44, Gewehr43, etc. You will be able to find a weapon that suits your style. You can also use pistols and throw grenades/rifle grenades.Guns sound powerful and have a nice “thud” when using them. I have no complaints about the soundThe biggest issue I found with the weapons is balance. There are some weapons that are clearly superior, such as the BAR (or maybe the U.S. weapons just suck?), and some weapons that need to be adjusted, such as the M1 Garand or Thompson. German weapons, for the moment, seem fine.Some of the weapon balance issues are compounded by the fact that the maps are small. I have played three maps (Carentan, a snowy map, and Thunder?). I will speak more of the design of these maps in another section. Small maps greatly enhance the advantages of automatic firearms. This makes weapons that are powerful, and also fully-automatic like the MP44 and BAR, extremely potent. Weapons like the G43, M1 Carbine, and M1 Garand suffer a disadvantage (K98k is still viable since it kills in one hit generally) in these environments. Since, most weapons are quite lethal, it’s much easier and effective to use automatic weapons over single-shot or semi-automatic ones. In older games like COD 1, COD 2 or COD:UO, nearly every weapon was effective regardless of the map (although your approach was different).Additionally, Call of Duty factored in the weight of the weapon as a balancer. In Days of War, regardless if you hold a pistol or a BAR, you will still be running the same speed.Gameplay-Map DesignMaps look nice, no doubt about that, but a healthy dosage of balanced-and competitive maps keeps an FPS running for years. Right now, the map design needs work. There seem to be too many chokepoints, or long corridors wher enemies  can just fire down. I understand that the develoeprs want to keep the aciton constant, but  this prevents players from thinking strategically, and closes off choices.I am assuming more modes and maps are on the wayVerdictI may have presented a flurry of negatives, but Days of War is a solid game, even in Early Access. There is a lot of work to be done, but the game carries much potential, exmplified by the quick hotfixes the developers have done these past couple days. I would reccommend this game to those looking for a WW2 FPS that isn't as realistic as Insurgency or Red ORchestra, but much more realistic than a twitch shooter."

Developers have been extremely active and receptive to feedback. I believe there's been at least 1 patch a day since early access so far.I've enjoyed my time with it so far and can't wait to see how it improves in the future. If you're on the fence, I'd give it a month or two wait and come back to check on it.Edit: After over 5 months of early access, the development of the game has just gone in circles with no real goal in sight. No good maps, no map editor, no basic/standard features that would allow a competitive community to play, and the developers keep wasting time on flip flopping on things that should have been set during the alpha (removal of ADS and going from high recoil to low recoil back to high recoil). I've already purchased it so I'll keep checking in on the game but I'm sure most people including myself have lost faith in this project."

Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't as smooth feeling as DOD:S. Many maps feel too wooden as well. Also, if you're a run-and-gun player, you're gonna have problems. Lots of campers with rifles on maps that you won't ever see. I feel that the maps are a bit dark as well. Omaha being the best lit of them. Hit reg seems okay for the most part. The players for now seem to be more focused on kills, I haven't seen much actual capping of flags or objectives being tried for. I think $25 is too steep a price point right now for this game. I do believe more people would get into it at say, $14.99 or so. Omaha is really the only map I think has potential at the moment. There is Donner, which will feel familiar to some players. But the maps feel more open and interactive in say Day of Defeat Source than they do in Days of War. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but I can't seem to hit players thru windows from the outside, but they can hit you just fine. I don't know if this is currently a game issue that needs attention. I know it's EA, and I'm giving the devs the benefit of the doubt here that things will improve. The game has some potential. But I was hoping for more of a DOD game with better graphics and hit reg, and so far, this hasn't felt much like the highly anticipated or touted ""sequel."""

,Not Recommended,454350,29542158,Posted: 28 January,all,boot,"NEW REVIEW:This is one of those titles in early access that looks like something in the beginning and turn out to be the exact opposite a few months afterwards.First of all, don't buy the game. Servers are empty and there are no bots, so you would just waste your money.As you can see below, I used to like the game but why am I not recommending it now and why is nobody playing it worldwide?Simple answer: devs don't give a sh!t. Early access should be devs and the playerbase going down the same path the former listening (reasonably) to the latter.We asked for more map variety and gamemodes and what did they do? They removed ADS basically breaking the game. It's been a month now and they don't seem to listen anymore, so just move along and wait for other titles. This game isn't just worth the money it asks (it's not worth any amount of money to be fair, as it is in its current state).Empty servers + devs not caring = days of failure.Don't buy the game.OLD REVIEW:CURRENT SYSTEM: i74710HQ, GTX 880M, 16GB DDR3 RAM.So far I've only tested this game on this laptop and I cannot hit constant 60 fps at all times even at lowest settings with just resolution to 1080p and full scale rendering. The game is still very playable though and fps settled around 45-55 without dipping down low in 32 players servers.I've played a copule hours so far and I have mixed feelings about this game, but overall the reasons to give this game a bit of trust outweigh those who don't.The game is in early access, so it's clear that the content isn't much and maps are very few (just 3 so far). You can pick between 9 different classes for each faction and every class is well defined and different from the others.The recoil is very strong and there's also what appears to be a random bullet spread so once you've managed to master recoil, you still can't hit with 100% accuracy your target.Headshots are deadly with any weapon and every bolt action rifle is generally 1 hit kill. Submachine guns, even if not 1 hit kill, are 3-4 hit kills so overall the time to kill is very low. Mastering recoil will give you a great edge on your opponent allowing you to win almost every gunfight (scratch those few where your opponent panicks and hits you in the dome piece with a lucky headshot).When you jump at first into your match, you're gonna have most definitely a hard time, because you don't realize you're being shot at and just die. There are damage indicators but as aforementioned as soon as you start taking damage (assuming it's an smg you're being shot with) you will have little to no time to react.Unlike in counter strike where you slow down where you're getting shot and get aim punch, there are no visual effect of you taking damage. This combined with the fact that you cant generally tell from which direction bullets are coming from (no whizz sound like in arma or impact to nearby surfaces or even a distinct explosion from enemy rifles) make really hard to tell with pinpoint accuracy where your opponent is, so map awareness and checking spots becomes vital.Once you get used to this weird feeling, however, the game becomes a bit more enjoyable.Movement felt quite sharp and hits were solid even tho I played on a rather cr*ppy connection. Prefire is a viable tactic and I never felt like I was dying around corners, so netcode feels pretty decent for an early access game.Balance wise the game is... weird.Maps are quite beautiful, tight alleys alternate with long open spaces where snipers reign supreme, but with a bit of skill and map knowledge flanking becomes really effective.Keep in mind that real life fightings happened in cities, with a layout that isn't game-friendly, so it's very complicated to balance out a map.SIDE NOTE: Omaha beach is clearly Axis sided, but how can you balance that? It's just how real life landings were...I felt, however, that gun balance wasn't really on point. Maybe it was just be but to make an example, the MP40 felt way less 'kicky' than the Thompson, same said for the STG44 being way more controllable than the BAR Browning.Never the less, once you get used to recoil, there isn't all this difference between all the automatic weapons, still that was my sensation.Serverwise the game was populated enough to find full servers, this in a saturday afternoon.Summarizing what I just written, is the game wort its price, yes or no?Depends. At it's current state, if the game wasn't early access and the developers weren't fully keen on fixing and improving the game performance, balance and mechanics, it would be a plain scam. Nothing more nothing less.However, taking the EA state into account, the fact that AT LEAST it's not sold at 60 bucks and that the downsights of this game CAN be fixed, it's all up to you.If you feel like these developers should be trusted, you can have a few hours of good fun without jetpacks and boosters for 20 bucks, if you don't feel like you wanna take the risk, wait for a furthermore developed state and keep an eye on the reviews.Honestly, for the price and my first impressions playing the game, I can recommend this.EDIT: Tested with i7 6700k, GTX1080 and 16 gb DDR4 ram.Game's always above 90 fps with everything maxed out."
,Not Recommended,454350,29546108,Posted: 28 January,all,Kerfefer,"!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!! This review was written near release and my opinion is no longer the sameThis is now a negative review due to recent changes. The devs are absolutely clueless and i dont want to give them any credit...When I first saw gameplay videos on youtube I found that it looked unpolished and I thought it wouldn't play smooth. After purchasing the game in the interest of playing 2 hours, refunding, and giving a review I felt mislead by my own assumptions. The game is not a realistic or slow paced game like RO:2 or DOI and that's why I think its getting so much flak. Most of the audience is looking for a new tactical WW2 shooter, which it is to a certain degree but not in the same way as the games previously mentioned. It is a competitive shooter in the style of Day of Defeat and Counter Strike, where movement is key and aim down sights is nothing more than a bit of zoom. I loved the return of the counter strafe tactics with the bolt action rifles, which were almost identical to the usage of the Kar98 in Day of Defeat source. You could strafe peek a corner, counter strafe, and then shoot the split second that your accuracy was at 100%. Single shot head shots and high damage weapons make the combat feel intense and skill based. Being a Counter Strike fan I sincerely enjoyed the competitive nature of this game and with a bit of work it has the potential to become one of the best competitive WW2 shooters of all time.While the current state of the game may not impress you I have very high hopes that this game will improve over time and turn out to be a polished game. My hopes have been reinforced by the fact that on the DAY 1 UPDATE they have already fixed a few FPS issues, communicated with us the steps they will take towards finishing the project, and went in detail as to how they are going to fix the current performance issues. The following are my Pros and Cons for the game in its current state.Cons:- Bad performance (Ex: gtx 750ti, i5 4460, 16gb ram gets me about 70-80 fps 1080p medium settings after the day 1 update but on maps such as DOW_Omaha I only get 30-40. DOW_Thunder and DOW_Carenteen get the best performance and I can see them being the best maps for competitive play.)- Voice chat is very choppy- Bad visual indicators- Old, boring gamemodes- Gamemodes currently do not reflect the competitive theme of the game- Voice overs very limited (No German voices, flag capture voice is American even when Germans capture a point)- In game UI is low quality as compared with the menu- Strange grenade physics- Inconsistent footstep soundsPros:- Clean, skillbased gameplay- Many classes- Many weapons- Promising roadmap- Good dev communication (So far)- Crosshair customization- Decent visuals- Potential for Esports in the future"
,Not Recommended,454350,29577285,Posted: 29 January,all,Meatgrinder,Do I recommend this game? Yes and No.  I voted yes because I see its potential.This game is a good foundation for what I believe it can grow into. This is early access so if you are not patient or do not understand the concept of what early access is then you should probably stay away. DOD:Source is the only FPS game I play so I am not comparing my review to other games like COD or counterstrike. But why would I anyway?The game is fun and seems balanced. Right now there only seems to be 3 maps but if they release the level editor this will change along with the plans they have for more bundled content (It better not be a DLC)If you get bent out of shape that your hardware isn't performing at its peak then you should probably stay away. There is some tweaking to do with respect to framerates. There also seems to be some rendering issue where objects sometimes don’t fully load textures until you run up on them.There are also object Physics issues where dropped weapons and bodies twitch and spin on the ground. Again not a big deal since this is early access.Things I would like to see are:Camera Focus on who killed you.Better Frags and other explosionsMore Gore. Possibly Soldier of Fortune level of gore.Better performanceIn Summary: I would say get this game if you want to help the developers fininsh it and make it betterDon't if all you want to do is whine in game chat how COD is better or whine in general.UPDATE:This game is dead. No one is playing. All servers are empty. Another waste of money.Leasson Learned: NEVER do early access.

So with that stated, let's get started.Days of War is a fast paced shooter set in WWII, as you can clearly see from the pictures and description of the game. I don't have much time in this game, but I found it very boring for the short amount of time that I played it. In the game (so far) you can choose to either play as the American Army or the German Wehrmacht. Both sides have weapons that would have been used by them at the time. Map design is pretty great. There is lots of places to take cover and they are decently sized.Gameplay- I might have been too high at the time to notice but I found it very difficult to tell what the hell the objective was. I found myself running around trying to find what I was supposed to do. Honestly, I never really found out. I also feel like the gameplay is pretty boring. In my opinion, it pretty much went like this. You are basically running around trying to find enemies to kill.... That's it. (Unless you managed to find out what the objective was).Another thing that kind of bored me was the fact that there is little to no ambient noise. So, the only time you really hear noise is when you are shooting, or running.Servers- There are quite a few servers available. Are they ever full? There might be one server out of like fifteen that will be full. The servers do seem to lag quite a bit (from my experience).Overall, this game is pretty far from being complete. But, it is early access and I will have it around until it is complete. The reason I am deciding to keep the game installed is because I see great potential in this game. If we look back at Day of Infamy, it started out pretty plain too, but look where it is now. Would I reccommend this to anyone as of right now? Not really. Reason being, twenty five dollars is asking a lot considering where the game is currently. But, if you ever get it as a gift, give it a try and see what you think."

The gamespeed is also nice but I can understand that it might feel a bit too fast for someone coming from more tactical shooters like RO2/DOI. The first time I played DODS again it felt like WW2 on crack ^^, but now I really got hooked to the fast paced gameplay.The gun aiming is also fine for me and they are still balancing it.Things that keep me away from playing right now :- need a new video card, with my nvidia GTX 650 I'm gettin low fps or weird (geometry ?) flickering on low settings- they already updated the first person weapon sounds, but the third person ones remind me of WW2 -  the popcorn edition ;D- need more content (I know there are ppl on 24/7 avalanche servers on DODS)So I recommend the game right now if you have a better video card like me (maybe gtx 950 and better), dont bother with the content right now (bet updates will be there soon).

I would argue that it does so brilliantly. If you're looking for the above, DOW is on the right track.For an Early Access game, it's well put together, but not without it's flaws. It is, after all, incomplete.The sound design is well done and I can't wait to see what sound effects will be replaced - the team has already said that most are simply 'placeholders'. The graphics HEAVILY outweigh DOI and DOD combined - this is a WWII shooter truely worthy of 2017. The gunplay is effective and meaningful, the weapons 'feel good'.Some animations need work and some need outright replaced.

,Not Recommended,454350,30211831,Posted: 26 February,all,Volt,"What is Days of War?DoW is a first person WWII themed shooter that brings old school feel to a modern shooter. The game is being developed on PC and later will be ported to PS4 and XBone.EA StateThe game needs work in basic mechanics and weapons. Getting recoil, hit boxs, and ADS right is challenging. It needs to feel balanced and fun to play and right now it struggles to accomplish this. There are only three maps but more are planned as well as editor tools for modders so that the public can design maps. The community is small but as developement is refined I expect it to grow for those this style of shooter appeals to.Broken ADSADS is broken in this game atm and needs to be addressed. Not only does ADS not improve aim and reduce recoil, it is actually more difficult to control than hip fire and jumps up about 2/3 of the way thru your magazine. It is worse than hip fire atm and thats a porblem.  Here is a video to show you what I am talking about.ADS has been removed from the game from everything but DMR/MR. This was a bad move in my opinion and is the reason I no longer play/support this game.https://youtu.be/kVdf3py6F6gDev Plan - Road MapThe road map includes engine improvements, weapon balancing, more maps, weapon sounds reworked, enhanced communication, VOIP (3rd party), skins (although this is vague), player stats, a progression system, and map editor tools. The road map will take time as with any EA game but once it is complete, I believe this game will be worth playing for those happy with the dirrection the game has taken.Real ThreatThis game has present and future threats. We have BF1 which uses weapons available at the end of WWI and thru WWII, CoD is returning to WWII this year, DoD will most likely be getting a face lift to Source 2 this year or next, and a handfull of quality WWI & WWII indie games to choose from. This game needs to get it right sooner than later. It needs to standout so it can build a strong community and right now it isn't doing that. The Devs are alienating their consumers by switching dirrection and removing modern features the game was sold with like ADS and dumbing down gameplay.ConclusionAt this point with the Devs switching direction and removing rather than fixing promised features I cannot recommend something I myself will not play in it's current state. The Devs rarely respond to the community so we are left with the feeling that we are ignored rather than being part of the process which is a failed process for EA. This could be a great game with some tweeks but at this point I am not impressed."

The gameplay is fast, fluid, and fun. It reminds me ALOT of Day of Defeat. Legit, its basically DoD 3. I would even say its better than DoD. There are only 4 maps but the game did just go into Early Access. And the devs have already made an update fixing issues! The games been out for like less than a week. The only problems I have with the game are the price, teamkilling, stamina, and the inability to aim down sights. Teamkilling happens way too often and there needs to be more punishment for it, if it doesn't just get removed completely. I played a match and got killed by my own teammates more than I did the enemies. There is also no way to set it to hold to ADS. It's stuck to toggle, which I don't really like. Also the stamina is kinda annoying it just doesn't need to be in this game. It runs out way too fast to, It takes you ages to get to the action because of the stamina.The other problem is the price. $25 is a bit expensive for this kind of game. I would say it should be more around the $15-$20 range. I trust that the devs will pump out more content and patches though and am looking forward to where this game goes. If you're a Day of Defeat fan I HIGHLY recommend, and if you're not it's still fun but I might wait for the price to drop.

Guess the game is cpu intensive but I dont think I can recommend it right now. Hope the Devs see the overall negatives in the game and make it better. Waiting to purchase again in the future.

Action is fast-paced and fluid but there's an immediate sense of a much higher skill cap for team-based play. Physics feel very realistic. The maps and textures are gorgeous and for an Early Access title this has an unusual amount of polish. There's nuanced, tense corridors with subtle elevation changes accounting for inclines you could imagine yourself stumbling over. Individual mouse sensitivity settings for hipfire, aiming down sights and scopes. Death often comes by surprise and with as few as 1-2 bullets.

The foundation is there, the game looks decent, I am sure more fidelity will be added. TH main problems are spawns are fixed instead of dynamic depending on enemys and flags captured which creates familiar fights and people camping corners. It is not clear where the objective is and gun sounds are generic. ( I am aware sounds are a placeholder). It is fun to fight the recoil of your weapon and makes for some intense fights. My advice is to wait a few months and see what changes are made. If you want an old school shooter then pick it up when it releases."

Because of those issues nobody plays the objective, they play to get kills. Which is fine but theres no progression system so its gets boring at least for me really quick.

However, when AA is increased in graphic options a blurry hue becomes very noticable. My advise is to turn off AA for now until the devs fix this glaring EA issue.SoundRather dissapointed by this. Firing any weapon is distinctly lacking in a sense of power and noise. All weapons currently sound like pea shooters with the exception of the US springfield. This will change once development moves on but it is nonetheless a dissapointing feature of the game at the present time.Map designHaving played all 4 maps, I'm a bit concerned that there are to many cul de sacs in this game. What I mean by that is there are far to many areas where you can't help but get mown down as there are no alternative paths in which to flank from. This is particularly noticable in maps such as Carentan and Thunder. There are many days ahead but I would like to see the devs change up the maps a bit so its tactically interesting for both sides.Weapon loadoutsNothing to mention here. Same as any WW2 game. Both sides have some 10 weapons to choose from incliding bazookas and LMG's.ValueComing in at £25, this EA title is steep for what your getting. Though the graphics are excellent that alone cannot keep a game afloat for long. This game is in danger of burning out very soon if basic issues such as sound are not addressed.ConclusionWait and see where the updates take this game in the next 3 months.I voted positive to push this game from 69% (mixed reviews) to 70% (Mostly positive) as that what this game is so far, a mostly good experience."

The map Avalanche on DoD: S still gives me horrible flashbacks to this day.Issues: The sound effects for some of the weapons really do need to be beefed up. I had an MG42, had not fired it up to this point, set it up in a bunker, and all I could do was laugh becuase it sounded like a pea shooter. When you fire an MG42 on any game, you automatically expect to have your ear drums blown, unfortunately, this isn't the case AT THE MOMENT for Days of War. Another sound effect worthy of some steroids is the M1 Garand's clip ping. It was very underwhelming when I heard the sound effect for one of the most iconic sounds of WW2 being made to sound like a drop of water on metal. Also the guns that are dropped by the dead sometimes spaz out on the floor, but ya know, this game is still in its early stages. So the future of Days of War looks bright.I'm okay with the price I paid (£19.99) becasue I absolutly love the DoD games and just WW2 in general."

It's definitly a throwback to the classic WWII shooter, but is still an original take.The price is a bit much for what is currently presented, and, given how early it is in development, I'm letting quite a few faults slide. In the game's current state, I'd rate it a 6/10. I'm looking forward to seeing this game improve, and I'm sure it will garner a strong following."

There's a new class that's got the shotgun, all the others are similar.It's still early access but it should be optimized easily, performance is a common issue with early builds on this engine, Squad also improved a lot after all content was added in and the devs went in and optimized the game. This game is nowhere near as burdening to your system (no vehicles and no giant maps) so it will turn out fine.It's still early access as there's a few sharp edges but the general systems are already into the game and it's already looking gorgeous, I say try it and you may love it."

,Recommended,454350,29512154,Posted: 26 January,all,Waultor Wyte,"Surprised to see so many mixed reviews; it seems like people still buy early access games expecting a finished product.First of all, If you're expecting this to play more like a simulation like Arma or Red Orchestra, look elsewhere; Days of War is all about its fast paced class based gameplay.For what's in the game now, Days of War is a fantastic early access game if you're looking for a classic DoD like experience. This feels like what Day of Defeat Source SHOULD HAVE played like; it's got a very wide selection of classes and each weapon feels like it can be used in a certain circumstances.The pacing is fast and frantic but due to the excellent map design there's still plenty of room for tactics. The Omaha Beach map is one of the best I've played in awhile and feels incredibly balanced given how chaotic it is and how tough it usually is to balance those types of maps. All of the envrionments feel handcrafted and there's plenty of places to flank, hide and ambush your opponents. Even though the shooting mechanics don't feel as fine tuned as they could be yet, it's very reminiscent of classic DoD where it's not so much about focusing with a weapon or using ironsights but about quickly changing your stance to take pot shots in the midst of combat.My biggest complaint right now is that it just ""feels very early access"" as others have said; there's a complete lack of envrionmental sound effects and the guns, while they don't sound bad, don't sound nearly loud or powerful enough. my other big gripe is just that the shooting mechanics feel a little stiff and floaty; I can't put my finger on what it is exactly by it seems like the weapons need some fine tuning to feel and sound more realistic.The graphics are good but I'm playing at 2560x1440 and I can't help but feel like everything looks a little washed. The animations are good except there needs to be a proper one for when you die.There's also currently a lack of any kind of profile to track things like k/d or an after game scoreboard, but these are first on the track to get added to the game, so I'm not really bothered by it. What I'm more annoyed by, however is the current lack of teamkilling penalty; there's not even a means to kick a player via votekick. Luckily, these are all minor problems that don't hinder the way the game plays and they're all very easy fixes.But overall I'm really liking where Days of War is going. It's already got the best part of any game down: the gameplay. With lots of polish and some extra content, this game could be a lost Day of Defeat fan's new home.Will update/add to review later in ea and/or on release."

This will be a pros and cons review (scince i'm to lazy to spend a 20 mins to write).OBS: I'm reviewing the alpha so the things i say might be changed in the future, this is my own opinion.Pros:-Decent gun system, can see some few things that needs to be improved or added such as weapon sway when walking and aming.-First person animations for guns look cool and smooth.-Decent amount of maps for being in the alpha stage.-Nice graphics in general.Cons:-Very skill based, you might go against someone that's WAY better then you.-(I know everybody complains about this but) 25 euros might be a little too much.-Snipers are a little too OP.-Grenade system and effects are kinda floppy.Summary: Should I buy the game right now? It's kind of a yeah and nah situation. The price is high but the game is still being updated frequently. Do you like skill based fps games that's WW2? then yes you should get the game. If you want something cheaper and more finished then get Day if infamy or Day of defeat. Both are cheaper and finished. I still enjoy playing Days of war and will probably do in the future too.

As someone who has spent many hours playing DOD, DOD:S, and MOHAA, I can say that the game play and content is exactly as advertised.  It is an old school shooter that goes ""back to the basics"". A solid shooter, and a really good start.The game is simple, unlike most of the AAA shooters that have come out over the past few years.  I like the fact that the weapon options (around 10 or so) are all available from the start, just like they used to be.  No progression, ranking system, or unlocks.  No ""pay to win"", in-game currency, or built-in perks/hacks, which is refreshing.  The graphics are nice, mechanics are acceptable, and there are several maps, that seem about the size of the maps (Western Front) from DOD:s and MOHAA.With that said, keep in mind that this is Early Access.  Don't expect it to be perfect.  There is plenty of room for improvement, which I'm sure is being addressed and constantly improved. Here are just a few of the improvements I would like to see prioritized:- Graphic optimization/SLI support- Overhaul of Audio (can hear footsteps all over the place, more realistic weapons, effects, etc.)- Lag spikes, which I usually never get- A different scoring system and couple more game modes. I actually like the ticket scoring system, as stalemates (like in DODS) become the norm.- Continual updates to eliminate map glitches, bugs, etc. (which is obvious, but continued support and improvements will be vital to this game having a good community)"

Movement is not as tight as CS or DOD 1.3. Feels a bit floaty like DOD:S. You won't be doing many trick jumps, but you can jiggle peak and beat people with movement.Guns - More variety than DOD. I like it. I'm sure there will be tweaks and balances put in.Maps - A map editor is in the works. The current maps are being worked on and improved, but some are taken from other games and they don't play very well.. lots of spawn camping. Stick to Thunder.FPS is good.i5-4690k Nvidia 970gtx run on ultra while streaming and get 90fps. On low/medium w/o streaming I get 150fps.

If you loved games like DoD and don't care bout spending 25€ on a pretty rough beta then go for it...Otherwise you'll maybe wanna wait until some updates come out to make it more enjoyable/playable....Coming from back in the days when there was NO steam and we played DOD by meeting on the right server which was arranged by telephone and later via WON (for those who remember...) I think I know what has driven Driven Arts (pun intended) to make this game.And here are the good news: For the most part the achieved their goal pretty good!The game has (besides lots of early access bugs/glitches) good gameplay and weapon behaviour not as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it was in DoD:S, and on top it looks pretty OK (that's enough for this type of game, we don't need fancy frostbite for a game like that)Right now I'm a little torn because on the one side I really DO enjoy playing - on the other there are too much bugs glitches and stuff to really justify 25€If the devs listens to the community and manage the game to perform better (♥♥♥♥ing UE4 engine sucks...)it CAN be good!I've got an i7 with 16G RAm and r9 380 and have to switch everything to low when map changes to omaha to at least reach 40 fps (which is not enough in this game trust me), on the other maps i can crank it up to high and have 50-60 most of the time (which is where it starts to be playable).And common guys i can run BF1 all settings on ULTRA and have constant smooth fps....I won't list all the thing's that are good or bad because .....

I bought this game yesterday on the release of Early Access and i played it continuously for 6 hours to get a feel for it.What i can say is that the game is very easy to handle, you almost dont need to use the iron sights at all and just aim at people with your crosshair, which is not a bad thing by itself but i would rather see that the of crosshair got a bit nerfed and the ironsights was left as the choice to aim.Overall the game feels and handles good. I have a i7 4970K 4.0, 980Ti with 16 GB of RAM. My fps is steady between 60-70 fps. So i dont notice the problems some of the others have, people who complain that they have problem with fps even on low settings usally has AMD i've noticed.One of the most fluent Early Access release in a long time.If you like to quick scope, jump and headshot or just run straight into a group of Germans and mow the down with your Thompson this is the game for you."

I hope that in the future that there will be enough different maps to make up for it's pitfalls. To me there are just simply games that are better that feel very similar being made on the unreal engine. I wanted to like it because I love CoD WaW, and was looking for another fun shooter in WW2 theme that wasn't too serious in terms of realism, but enough to be immersive and take the games seriously.For me, this game played very close to Dirty Bomb, with WW2 weapons. Maybe a little bit of Urban Terror thrown in. Now, I like those games... but this just lacked in gameplay. I found also the maps really hindered the already very simplistic gaming style. I think it would behoove developers to make more open space outside arenas if they can. I fully understand this is an early dev game, but certain aspects where it feels the paint is already dry, like core gameplay, turned me off in face of everything around it.That being said, I know some people will enjoy this game for what it is, and if you have $25 and a few days in case you don't like it burning in your clock and wallet, are into simple shooters and WW2 themes, it's maybe not a bad idea to try. I wish I had more positive things to say, because a good but fun WW2 shooter idea feels a noble one right now. Hopefully it develops really well in the future and people enjoy the game."

,Not Recommended,454350,29586363,Posted: 30 January,all,Raviolay,"The game is anything but fast paced, a short TTK is not fast paced although many in the game chat seem to think so , I dont mind a short TTK but I will get on to that latter. The maps are poor the largest factor in it's failings, I mean really poor there is no scope for anything other than sitting on a corner and camping. The low TTK slows the gameplay even futher down, as nobody will push up and do anthing. I also have to run the game at the lowest setting to get anthing remotly playable, and it is a fuzzy mess to look at. So it's no very clear for IFF, so I think that compounds the slowness even more with regards to the player base.If it's hard to tell what your looking at that is going to breed slow methodial play. For a ""fast pace game"" it takes an age to switch weapons, crouch, go prone the overall movement feels slower at 120 FOV that it does on older Call of Duty (1,2,4 & WAW) games with a FOV of 80.  The only good feeling I had playing the game was beasting automatic weapons with a bolt action. Then I used automatic weapons and found out why I was beating them more often than not. It's a learing curve and easy to adjust to however. Although it does make certain weapons sand way out, as better RE thompson/STG-44.I purchased Day of Infamy yesterday and have racked up double the playtime, and for a game that is not sold as fast paced, it generally is faster in it's pacing that this trove of falsehoods. The maps are larger with more scope for movement. And overall the movement in day of infamy is faster with faster swiching even going prone is slighty faster in day of infamy. If you havent guessed it I would recomend you buy both, and you should rapidly see what I am getting at.Hopefully it will get better but on past experiance I doubt it."

76561198064106555,Not Recommended,454350,29508400,Posted: 26 January,all,mrorange,"I don't recommend this game. In my opinion it is only for hardcore WW2 old shool shooter fans. It is Early Access, sure some stuff will change. I rate it not on promises, but on what I play now and see now.I know you are on the fence. It is WW2. It has old classical guns and it might be the back to the roots shooter you desired, because you think CoD is too ""future"", Titanfall to complicated and your PC can not run Battlefield 1.And yes, I am rating it as it stands and as it asks me money. I don't believe in big promises when it comes to Early Access. I own over 1090 games on Steam, a lot of Early Access titles. Only in rare cases games really have changed (like Rust, The Forest maybe... actually most games are still in development  - DayZ -  and will not be finished until the moment I would have lost interest in a game. Therefore we should look at games in our Early Access reviews as what they are.First what I like:- WW2 theme of course and the guns- sound of the guns is kind of cool- gun models are well made- graphics are decent, I don't think it is bad, but it is also not very creative or interesting. Looks like a HD version of an old WW2 shooter- controls are good and a lot of options / for key mapping and mouse- Server browser; I don't necessarily need it; but some people think this is importantWhat I don't like:- Early Access, which includes in general that a lot of the points where I complain about are related to this fact; but so be it.- Almost no content - 4 maps- boring maps, totally unspectacular map design- one shot kills and that constantly; mostly you have no idea from where they came from; characters do not look any interesting- too simple gameplay - run, hide shoot, don't get killed, run hide shoot don't get killed- no idea what the objectives are - Capture the flag?- what is the sense of this tiny map on the left side; I cannot even see my character on it- no real purpose in the game, because it is old shool, you just play for the reason to shoot an enemy and win a match with 32 other players or more, but no special interest for single player gamer; no exp system, but read sth is in the making, fine.- after one hour, not finishing a single match to the end of the long 20 minutes of a match, I feel like I have seen everything and it is not necessary to go back in the game.Overall, this game is not for me. And I will refund it. I think personally 25 EUR is too much if I compare it to other Early Access games or full games on Steam. The game feels and looks like a free2play title. For some fast rounds against strangers.I am sure the developers are promising plenty of things they want to implement in the game. I believe that they will do implement stuff. And yes, I like the controls in general. But is it getting me into this game more than into one of the 100 other very good competitive shooter, including even WW1 and WW2 shooter. I doubt it.I am not recommending the game. But if you are hardcore WW2 fan and you still play all those old school WW2 shooter and you think CoD sucks and all those other games like Titanfall 2 or Battlefield are also to complicated for you. Sure go for this one and enjoy it. You might like it.Rating: not a bad game, it has potential yes, but for now it is a no for me, maybe a yes for you, but no, not for me; average 5/10."

,Recommended,454350,29536772,Posted: 28 January,all,scre4m,"Days of War is currently the most promising Early Access FPS Game on Steam.It will always be compared to Day Of Defeat and Day of Infamy. Not only the name but also many core gameplay mechanics and in some cases even maps are identical.So why is DoW so promising? Many people bash the game for its bad performance and few maps right now. On a high end rig or with small servers you can currently test the full capability of the game. And in my opinion the game feels a LOT more smoother and fluid gameplay-wise and movement-wise than Days of Infamy right now and the map design of the current maps is way better.Having a look at the current roadmap they published and peoples' reports from closed test before steam EA the devs of DoW really mean to do and are capable of achieving their goals.If you want a finished game do not buy DoW (yet) and expect it to be finished or always fun to play. The animations♥♥♥♥♥up anybody's PC right now on full big servers, the grenades have immense delay and desync, some weapons are plain OP. But this is all subject to change.Right now though play Day of Defeat Source for some polished gameplay and only buy DoW if you are willing to a) support the devs or b) are prepared to wait some time for the game to become what we all want it to be: Day of Defeat, but better looking, with better gameplay and a bigger playerbase.For now I give a thumb up, although imo they should have waited with EA 1 or 2 more months for 1 more map and do some more animation and grenade optimisations."

From what little game play I saw, the combat is alright, but it's like a hybrid Battlefield/ Day of Defeat. I'd suggest waiting to purchase this game until they make further improvements. I did get a refund though, so +1.2/10, will revisit in a few months."

Gun handling doesn't feel satisfactory. Feels like the the camera is too smooth causing a floating feeling.  Getting stuck on things. Shooting from 1st person perpective instead of the gun's barrel. There isn't any mechanics to prevent players from wiggling back and forth without any sort of hit to accuracy. Objectives aren't clear and there is no sense of coordination between players. Spawning directly into gunfire. Maps feel tiny. Instant respawn. I hate to say it but I didn't enjoy it.

I was unable to raise or lower any of the graphics options so I am unaware as to the scalability or the performance that this will function at on 1080p systems.  With that said,  I will state the following in regards to frame rate: at 4k and 1080 I averaged 55-60 fps, no major performance issues were noted until looking down the scope of a kar97, at this point I had frame rates drop by 1/3rd.  I feel that had I been playing at 1080p this would not have been noticed.-2- The weapons kick like a mule, and that's ok. But, the weapons handling seems forced and artificial.  I didn't personaly notice any sway, or issues with balancing the weapons after running full tilt half way across the map.-3- Becaused of movement speed I noticed no benefit to actually using the ADS system-4- You don't seem to be able to penetrate any objects in the game with bullets, I shot about 10 rounds at a single individual all the rounds struck wood, nothing penned.-5- The movement speed is far to quick even for a spiritual successor of day of defeat.-6- it's essentially a run and gun.-7- the german shotgun, has no choice of fire mode. This over under shotgun rifle combo forces the user to fire 2 vollys of shot followed by a single mauser round.  Give the option to choose.-8-  I didn't notice any fire selector switch-9-  return shots after  firing a single round in FA feels forcedOver all I feel like this game tries to play on both genres, tactical and the fast action genre. But it would be better suited if they slowed down the movement speed.   Your ""move"" speed needs to be slowed down to more of a walk.You're sprint speed should be what the current ""move"" speed is. No one on this planet can actually move that fast.  Essentially right now this game is essentially unreal tournament with garands and springfields.Blood splatter looks nice, but it's far too bright.Over all the game play feels forced and it isn't kenetic in any way from my observations..--- Update ---I spent more time in this game and noticed some maps are complete dupications of existing maps in other games...This game is a complete and utter peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I looked at the game play mechanics even further and spent more time in this game and it's god damn garbage.

I was hyped when Days of War was announced, and I really had high hopes, but so far it turned out to be a disappointment beyond measure.Pros:+I enjoyed the Kayserberg map design, reminds me a lot of Wolf:ET, snowy German town - perfect+the recoil feels like it did in DoD:S, for me it's a plus+map variants are a really cool addition, I'd like to see it in more gamesCons:-the graphics are such a disappointment, it doesn't look like a 2017 game, the devs were bragging about enhancing the graphics and the screens were fantastic, but in the end it looks all plasticI want to specifically mention the explosion, smoke and muzzle flash effects - how could anyone approve them even for early access??!! The first gameplay videos were totally different, now it looks so cheap I can't believe the devs don't feel any shame in releasing such cr**? I am not buying any ""ohh its EA its gonnabefixed"" excuses in this case, because it's just such a BASIC feature, I never expected it to be so bad. And don't even get me started on optimisation issues.-ATROCIOUS sound design - I'd really like to meet the sound designer who listened to these weapon sounds and said ""yeah these sound cool"". Oh my god. Again, it's such a basic thing, if they messed it up now, how can they expect people to trust them?-the devs made a really bad move with Thunder, they knew they're basically stealing from DoD:S all along and didn't even bother... well, they got what they deserved.-lack of atmosphere - alright, I know this can be fixed, just add some music here and there, after all it's EA... yeah...-lack of originality - there's literally nothing about this game that stands out, apart from maybe map variants, as I mentioned before. It's just a really poorly made FPS-THE PRICE - 25 eur????? They had a huge kickstarter campaign, promised to make a lot of really unnecessary features (why should I bother about British or Russians when the game just SUCKS?) instead of focusing on the gameplay. Again, Early Access is NOT and excuse here!

Even after turning some settings down and having a dig through some config files i cudnt find anything of use to combat the choppyness. For a game aimed at fast paced action a bad framerate will dig the own games grave. The mouse response due to the framerate feels off and inaccurate.In this games defence it has a fov slider, seperate mouse sensitivitys for aiming and hipfire and a few graphical options but after playing bf1 this year i feel spoiled by that games great optimisation. If this game is going to succeed it definately needs to focus on optimisation ASAP and the thought of a 100 man servers in its current state which has been advertised for February seems optimistic. As refreshing as it is to have an historical shooter back on the market its such a shame to see another game with relative potential released unoptimised. I understand this is early access but it would be nice to see a competent development team (which i believe this game has) not release a fast-pased shooter framerate shoddy. I may re visit this game futher down the development cycle, i just hope the player-base dusnt die off before further updates.I currently have a 1080, i73770k and 16gb's ram and the framerate was abysmal for a fast-paced shooter. If this was a tactical shooter such as squad lets say i can handle 60 fps as the twitch shooting aspect isnt so much of a priority. For me personally i run a 144hz monitor and in an ideal shooter for me i like games running 120fps+. Im sure there is fun to be had out of this game for some people but for me who likes to get abit competitive/try-hard sometimes the framerate and clunkyness in days of war makes it a nightmare for me.For me to re-purchase this game again in the future i would like to see.-higher framerates (i understand optimisation will happen)-the ability to disable ads zoom-be able to completely disable post processing (i hate the effects of anti-aliasing,post processing,motion-blur,bloom etc.)-a proper uniform aiming system so my hipfire and ads sensitivity is locked to the same amount-as a nice touch weapon gun model fov would be a nice addition aswell but i dont know what limitations the engine holds and whether that would be worth the time.All in all i dont feel days of war is a bad game, far from it. Just in its current state the unoptimisation, mouse response just feels generally off for a fast paced shooter. I however wish the developers all the best and will hopefully re-purchase at a later date in time when optimisation has played a greater role in development.Just a quick note to people thinking about purchasing-You can rebind keys (including mouse thumb buttons)-There is a fov slider (up to 120)there was a few config files i found-localc/users/yourname/appdata/local/daysofwar/saved/config/windowsnoeditor/*listofgameconfigshere*although there didnt seem to be much tinkering you could do for personal preferencesthere is also configs in your steamapp files but alot of them are defaultengine configs so i guess they wudnt have much impact."

For the price and current build it's not worth it. Want ww1 experience either get bf1 or day of infamy. Other than that, stay away from this crap."
