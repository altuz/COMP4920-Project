It differs a bit from most games in the genre by having you aim with the mouse rather than always shooting vertically. Pretty dang fun."

It is a game I own over several accounts and platforms.  It is a game that I have enjoyed for hours but is also great when I have a few minutes to kill.  I also applaud the developer of this game for the business model.  A fair price up front, but then no attempt to gauge with endless online purchses etc.  Once you buy this all future content is included.  Over the last 6 months I have been surprised on a fairly regular basis with new content releases.   That is really cool.  Its like getting a new game every so often.  To me this shows a real passion from the designer.  A passion for the art and a passion for the creation.  This should be supported and applauded and I cannot wait to see what this designer comes up with next."

But, that's not a bad thing. It makes you try out each character, and the more you play the more characters you get.It's a game that treats you the more you play.(Also 10/10 you guys got me hungry I had to fry some eggs.)"

,Recommended,454380,23731213,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Raithe,"This game has it's own high pedestal amongst bullet hells. As one plays, you'll constantly learn new things about the game and strategies to thwart the game's various fast-pacd enemies. Unlocking new characters to play as that all play differently is super fun, and when you find those one or two characters that just CLICK even stronger with your playstyle, oh boy ar you in for some fun. The 'Spice Cabinet' allows you to modify the abilities and difficulty of enemies in order to increase how many points collect to aid you in you quest for the top of the competitive leaderboard! Regardless of competition though, you can always try and imprive your own game. The feeling when you overcome a type of enemy that always gave you trouble is so emboldening. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!"

Great price for plenty of hours of trying to get to that high score (darn you devs..)25 eggs out of gazebo. Recommended for sure.

I absolutely love the passive upgrade system as well! Makes every play through a unique and challenging experience! To top things off, the sound track is the best I've ever heard!10/10"

,Recommended,454380,22238886,"Posted: 4 April, 2016",all,Yiff Wizard,"An endless, twin-stick shooter with charm that takes a goofy breakfast-themed aesthetic and injects it with chemical galaga. It's catchy tunes and it's easy to pick up nature keep you trying again and again to see what comes next- be it that elusive achievement or the current community-goal.. or even to get that high score.33 shrimp out of watermelon. Would reccomend."

Don't usually review things, but mother of mercy from what I have played this is FUN! I've played a few bullet hell games in my day but this one is a blast, especially with that sound track. The bullets are nice and visible so I never feel like when I die it was due to the game. 100% my fault, every time. Good stuff!!! Highly recommend it for anybody who wants to blow up a toilet with a toaster."

Who doesn't like leaderboards?! Although, good luck beating that score of [insert top score here]."
