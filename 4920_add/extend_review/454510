,Recommended,454510,22059527,"Posted: 26 March, 2016",all,Miya,"I am new to texture making and 3D Modeling. I make simple 3D models so far in blender and while i did a ok job at that, my texturing stuff is absolutely horrible.i used to use photoshop for it, while its really good in the image editor department, when it comes to texture editing i am absolutely terrible in photoshop. I thought i was just gonna deal with my ok 3D models getting absolutely terrible textures.Then this program popped up in my face. This Program is pure witchcraft. Instead of dealing with a flat image to texture something, it has the 3D Model and the texture loaded at the same time with real-time editing. This stuff is amazing. Best part is i didn't have to sign a pact with the devil to get better at texturing.All i did so far is make a texture for a medal model i made and i did a WAY Better job in 10 minutes than i did in 30 minutes-1 hour in photoshop. I even had Bumpmapping (Normals) and shiny metal textures (speculars) to go along with it rather than just a flat medal texture that doesn't pop.For a absolute beginner to texturing , i can't really recommend this enough. If your still on the fence about this, i would recommend checking out the trial and doing the Sci-fi Crate Tutorial that the devs of this program have on their youtube channel. It will show you how powerful this tool can possibly be.The Sci-fi crate tutorial playlist can be found here:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSDRWYc1VVj3KdMEqFZRTEVz0LnJdWi-3edit: just gonna say that this program won't replace photoshop, but it will make stuff way easier to create, which then you can just throw into photoshop for extra flair stuff or fine tuning.make a cool base texture for your model, then you can do fancy editing in photoshop to make it perfect"

,Recommended,454510,26729312,"Posted: 21 November, 2016",all,CORAL,"Best PBR Texturing/ Baking Program on the marketWell.... I think it’s the best, for me atleast. That's the thing about opinions, they are all subjective and unless you do a case study with like 10,000 people it’s all just personal opinions based on your past experiences which can be said for just about any kind of product or brand ever. Base line: Whatever works, works.Now I've used a lot of different Painting/ Texturing/ Baking programs over my time, starting with basic stuff like photoshop, websites like CGTextures (now Textures. com) for Texture sourcing and xNormals for baking different High to Low geometry maps. When PBR came around programs like Quixels nDo 2 & dDo came out first and yeah they are still neck and neck with Substance Painter in terms of functionality and power. I used Substance Painter 1 for 32 hours, textured a few assets but was not really impressed as I was already using dDo which as I understood better thus going back to dDo rendered me better results.In Comes Substance Painter 2 and I thought to myself ""ok, let’s give it a real shot this time around"" 150 hours and atleast 20-30 textured assets later it’s my program of choice right now. I've gone back to dDo every once in a while for specific assets and just to brush up but Substance Painter 2 is my go-to tool. Not only for PBR Painting either! There baking tools are flawless and I'm getting better results using the inbuilt baking tool with less errors then I would with xNormals which was unexpected as xNormals has been the industry standard for a long while.On to the main features though, The Texture Painting. Defiantly the most powerful of all software’s I've used. PBR Materials & Smart Materials are a great base to work from and provide a lot of different filters, masks and affects you can alter to your liking or add/create from scratch. Everything works in layers like photoshop with masks that you can also edit directly with brushes without having to go back and forth like dDo. You can even undo your mask changes! CRAZY RIGHT.You can create normal map decals in photoshop and import them into substance to then paint directly onto your mesh in 3D or 2D views. There are a few different particle brushes which give some nice but sometimes unexpected results that might not work as you expect depending on the asset, its size and both mesh/normal map angles. The Normal map painting works as expected, you set your decal, scale it and add where you want. Works great, good for adding lots of quick details really quick that would normally take a long time to do in 3D modelling.Some of the achievements are still bugged and have been since Painter 1 was released. Secondly the software is so damn stable I can't even do the report bugs achievement unless I just send them messages like ""hey, your program is pretty neat. Keep it up ;)""If you are going to add achievements to your product because steam offers the support for them please make them atleast function... Yes this might not be considered a game but as both and artist and a gamer I try to get the most out of my products, achievements included.9.6/10- If this program was a canvas & I was Bob Ross it would be a our Standard old 18 by 24"" canvas covered with a nice thin coat of the liquid hwite and its nice and wet and it's ready to go"

This makes the lack of comprehensive UDIM support all the more disagreeable and makes this a 'Not recommended' for people who are not making their own models.Original review:Pretty solid; it takes a couple of hours to get to grips with, but has a lot of functionality. It's probably not going to be your one-stop solution to all your texturing needs, but it goes a long way. There could always be more materials, bruses, generators, tools, and the like but the standard package is a good place to start.However - if you are going to be working with existing models that you cannot alter (in case of modding, rendering etc.) you will inevitably run in to the severely lacking UDIM support, lacking support for multiple textures per model, etc. In that case, Substance Painter is very hit or miss, and will probably not be a reliable part of your workflow."

,Recommended,454510,22076564,"Posted: 26 March, 2016",all,Charlie,"Before judging Painter 2, I should go with Painter 1 first.Substance Painter is a great tool for texturing your models. Traditionally, artists use photoshop to draw directly onto UV'ed texture maps. It worked as how you wanted. Then 3D applications like 3ds Max, Zbrush, and ect. supporting mesh or polygon paint come out. It works better and you can fix the seams along the UV shells. However, the problem still remains, players or audiences want better visual presentation, artists pursue more realistic result. So you don't just paint a texture map. Instead, you have to make an accurate material. It is where Substance Painter suits the need best.With Substance Designer, you can paint material directly onto your models. It has 2D + 3D viewport making it very useful to  monitor the result during the process. Moreover, it supports PBR and IBL by default which is currently an industrial standard.For people who are familiar with photoshop, don't worry, Substance Painter is simple to use and ease to comprehend. It supports alpha, brush, layer, erase, and things you can find in photoshop. So after few hours of playing it, you will get yourself into it.Another benefit is that you can use both Substance Designer and Painter at the same time, you can make some procedural textures in Designer and imported into Painter and then paint your custom details. It is a great combo.Also, a sweet thing is that you can bake your maps inside Painter. It saves your time and you don't need to swap applications to get your baked map into texturing process and you can always rebake and adjust them.So let's get back to Painter 2. It is a newer version of 1 with some fixes and improvements. From my experience, I noticed that 3D viewport has been improved, and thanks to Nvidia and Allegorithmic, they integrated Nvidia's Iray GPU render into Painter 2 after they've done it with Designer 5. This is a powerful render engine and you can get a photo-real result inside viewport and no need to load your texture and mesh into 3D application and make a render. Also, this make Painter even a competitor to Marmoset Toolbag 2 when presenting 3D assets.Next thing is paint and erase go physical, it provides magical result to your asset if you choose the right way, but sometimes it is difficult to control and the results don't look good.Particles works a lot better, leak and burn are matching more the way in real world. New smudge tool and clone tool are just like what you use in photoshop.The most important thing is I don't think Allegorithmic will continue updating Painter 1, so Painter 2 will be the future for them to improve. And Allegorithmic is trying their best to build an environment. Even if some features you expect don't show in Painter 2, I believe in them, Allegorithmic will make Painter 2 better in next years. Also, I got 50% off since I own Painter 1, and if you bought painter 1 after Feb 1st, you will get Painter 2 for free. So if you need a texture tool, just buy it, if you want future upgrade, buy it and even though you are comfortable with Painter 1, with Painter 2 grows you will buy it sooner or later, so just buy it now."

Problem recurred only when creating new paint layers. Other types of layers were fine.Bug 2: Paint turned translucent as if an alpha channel or masking occurred. No alpha channel, no masking, no special brushes, etc were in use. Could not paint or erase weird coloring of one layer obj model. Only reloading mesh and starting over worked.With 2 bugs within 2 hours, I can't give a thumbs up on this yet.. Will edit this when I see solutions."

It isn't an exaggeration to say that I couldn't function without Substance Painter 2, and imho, the world's a better place because this software exists.Next: my usage time isn't accurate. I used the trial version for the entire 1-month time period; then, I purchased the Indie pack (SP, SD, B2M3), used that for however many hours I've clocked on my Steam account. Then, I downloaded the 2.3.0 standalone version from the Allegorithmic website because I want to control which version I use, and Steam forces you to use the latest version, which isn't good under a controlled workflow. So, I've used SP2 religiously for the last five'ish months.When I first used SP2, I didn't like it. There was not at all wrong with it, I just hadn't taken the time to learn how to use it (wanted instant results, zero effort, but reality doesn't work that way). A learning curve exists, but it is minimal. It was mostly down me not having a clear picture in my head of what I was aiming at, and without that clarity, I ended up bumbling around for a few weeks (whilst the software patiently humoured my attempts at 'art').Computer specs: Intel i7-4770 @ 3.4 GHz, 16GB RAM, Windows 7 Pro 64 bit SP1, non-SSD drives. My GPU is a single NVIDIA GTX760 with 2GB of VRAM, and it's fine with SP2 (granted, after using countless multi-channel layers on a model, SP2 does slow down, which is a no-brainer on a two-year-old GPU running industry standard software).I could re-hash the praise of other reviewers, but I think it all boils down to this: if you are a 3D artist, buy this software, watch all the SP2 tutorials on YouTube, then take the time to learn the software (unless you're a pro, learning SP2 will not happen overnight).Everything ever made is limited. The trick is to learn those limits, and then how to work around them.11/10: would totally rant on Steam again about software I love :)"

If you need an excellent texturing/baking program, then this is it. Get the Substance Indie Pack, it's worth it."

It makes texturing a joy, especially once you figure out how to use it.I highly recommend learning about Substance Designer too, as it'll help you approach Painter with more procedural planning and ingenuity."

I use it to texture models before rendering them and then photoshopping them into images of myself, now everyone thinks I'm rich and successful, while I'm actually very poor and sad. In all honesty it is quite frobbing good, although you may need a beefy computer and some skills with 3d modeling and such."

I've used this software for a fair while now and my only gripe... and the singular reason in me not giving this software a recommended review is the stability issues.I'm somewhat on the fence review wise - after careful consideration I've fallen on the not recommend side . The last major crash which saw 4 hours work lost pushed me over the edge. Ideally - as I sit at 55/45 - I'd love to be able to write a review that would be 'neutral' - not recommend/not recommendBefore I delve into a more indepth reason as to why - here is my initial feedback on the software.Pros:- Wide range of PBR techniques to work with- Wide range of content available with the base version - presets, masks etc.- Lots of community created items available for purchase or for free download (smart materials, masks etc)- Easy to navigate viewport and HuD ( does take some getting used to)- Very compatible with current generation game engines.- Exceptional community support.Cons:- Lack of a stable recovery file system ( save on crash) - I've had this option appear once.- Smaller material preset choice compared to Quixels dDo ( ! though over dDo2, I would recommend this hands down)Back to why I can not wholy recommend this in its current state:I've had dozens of crashes working with higher resolution projects, and losing 1-5 hours of work is an absolute farce. The software does not offer an autosave feature, and any save on crash features that are present are very hit and miss.  I've had upwards of a dozen crashes, and only had the recovery save option appear once. Collectively I've lost upwards of 20  hours work, which as a freelancer - is really very frustrating as well as  extremely expensive.I am aware that one rebuttle would of course be to manually save more often - but I am not used to that routine ( most other software I use for work has an autosave function)I am also aware that due to the manner in which the software is built - an autosave/backup system is difficult to implement. I would quite happily settle for a little pop up reminder every 20-30 minutes - asking me to save progress. There are plenty of fixes for a small problem, but one which can so easily turn out to be a major issue.I'll continue using the product, and continue supporting it when newer versions come out - but the lack of any reasonable save file function - in this industry ... in 2017 ... is somewhat falling short for me.TLDR: awesome piece of kit, can not recommend until the stability is improved - and a better crash/error handling system included.UPDATE:Previous updates have fixed some of the issues , namely autosave functions which have been extremely useful."
