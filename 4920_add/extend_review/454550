,Not Recommended,454550,22572249,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,Galactic Samurai,"CONS:Be very careful of this product. You are basically buying a demo without an FBX or proper OBJ export.If you want to use Qubicle fully, for your game for instance, you will need to put in at least another 20 bucks or more.Why the developers chose to do this is beyond me. Clearly it is a money grab and can you trust software created by developers with this mentality? If they have any idea of how gamers think and had done their research on DLC from the last 5 years they would know that this is the wrong move. Clearly this is proven by the mixed reviews.When you open the software you will instantly be greeted with a bunch of options that are locked, simple things like 'creating a sphere,' 'box selection tool' or 'exporting an FBX' are greeted with ""This feature is locked because you don't own the required DLC.""PROS:On a positive note the software itself has potential. It has a very nice clean interface/control system, if you are familiar with Autodesk Maya you will know how to navigate instantly. That was a great move on their part.The way the software separates the individual model creation with the painting/translation viewports was also a very good idea. This keeps things clean when working with very complex meshes.HOW TO SAVE THIS SOFTWARE:With cube based aesthetics being a huge trend right now, Qubicle can do very well for itself if the developers do their research on gamer psychology. For instance:1. Stay away from DLC, unless you do it right and that is rarely the case these days.2. Release a full, affordable product ($40/$50.) You will make FAR more money with a cheaper product. Rarely does an overly expensive product (quality+target audience) work out, Photoshop and Autodesk are exceptions because they are vital products and studios are forced to buy them, students, indie teams and freelancers will torrent something if it's too much. If you are building a product FOR the indie community, which you are, then affordibility and a positive image are key. You will not only sell more but most importantly you will gain a positive and happy fanbase, which will support and stay with you for years.3. Don't faff around with, ""this is the commercial version, this is the indie version, this is the annual subscription"" You are overselling yourselves and overcomplicating things. This is a small product because it is only useful to a small percentage of artists, due to its styalized aesthetic. Keep it simple and release ONE software with commercial licensing. Tell the community you want to support THEM, not yourselves.4. Clearly money is important to your studio so build a positive image and then crowdfund. Be patient. This software is GOOD and it will pay off. I plan to build an entire game with it, but not until I have faith and trust in the developers.5. REMOVE the locked options! Until you can release a single full piece of software don't make people feel bad for purchasing your product.I hope I wasn't too harsh, but indie devs will tear you apart with your current format. If you don't want all of your hard work to go to waste then you need to rethink your strategies."

I purchased the standalone editor and felt like basic features were taken out.  The presentation and marketing completely eroded my trust in the developer.  I asked for a refund.The interface is covered in what are essentially advertisements for better versions of the software.  That's something people expect in demos and trial products. So its bound to be a surprise when someone sees that outside of those instances (i.e. having paid for proprietary software). The problem isn't necessarilywhichbasic features are missing, the problem ishowbasic features are missing.If they think we'll appreciate the locked features and 'demo' mode, they're assuming we aren't familiar with games - particularly of the free-to-play variety.  If they think we won't find their advertising invasive and distracting, they're assuming we don't understand design.  To think they're marketing this product to game designers is utterly baffling to me.Before making your purchase take a very close look at all the DLC pages.  There are some very basic features that are not available in the standalone product.  Some very basic functionality is locked into the DLC.  There are even features which available in 2.x trial version which are removed from the standalone editor.  Although, even reading all the information here may not be enough to callibrate your expectations.Here's an example : 'Object Heirarchies' is listed as a feature of the Utility DLC.  I had an existing project made in the 2.5 trial version which included multiple Stonehearth bodies loaded into a single .qmo(?) file, and it turns out I was no longer able to edit their bodies one piece at a time, or even properly export them for a mod.  I found myself reinstalling a trial version of a product I allready purchased; that's when I came to my senses and requested a refund.Perhaps the positive reviews should be placed on the DLC's page rather than here."

That's a game changer, excuse the pun.Yes, some features are behind DLC (the mesh optimization should be free, let's be real) but for 20 dollars you get the basic editor to see if it's right for you. It's not predatory at all, though some people here seem to disagree.It only took me 10 minutes to learn with their great tutorial. Within 20 minutes I had my first humanoid model. The only thing it's missing is a way to animate the models, but I'm sure something like that is forthcoming. Besides, other programs exist to suit that functionality."

I'm going to give this review, though, not based on these issues.Having tried Qubicle before (while it was still ""Qubicle Constructor""), I found it to be a great app and really wanted to purchase it, but couldn't. Either because I didn't have an international credit card at the time or exchange rate + taxes made it pretty expensive. This ""sliced"" release on Steam was the perfect opportunity to purchase the app (and I can upgrade it as I want, until I have the ""full"" version ;D).The app is great and runs pretty nicely on my PC (Win10 + i7 2600 + 8GB RAM + R7 250) until now, the basic features are good for the price and it's pretty easy to get into it, specially if you have any experience with a raster/vector graphics editor.After getting used to the Model + Matrix concept, the basic tools and other things, drawing is pretty simple and straight forward, slice mode is also really helpful (and totally required) for some drawings. Exporting and rendering is also a pretty straight forward process (I don't have mesh export yet, but it's ok :P).Also, the developers, from what I've seen, are willing to listen to the community and make the software adjust, according to users' suggestions, and the license is pretty fair for aspiring/small indie developers, as they can upgrade the software to a ""full"" commercial licence after they've earned resources to do so. :DOne point, though, that I'm not 100% with is the rendering, the cropping tool for the rendered area could have some improvements (possibility to type width/height, click+drag while keeping proportions), but it's ok. :)Recommended? Yes, highly! :)"

I really like the program.Well done Tim.Original Review:I have mixed feelings with this program.The program is very good but:Pros:I have tried it and it works great and I enjoyed working a bit with it.I am very inspired by it and I am going to use it a lot.Cons:I didn't know that you needed DLC to unlock features. I bought it instantly as soon as I saw it in the store.It should be more clearly stated as it is something you wouldn't expect in a modelling software.I probably would have bought the whole package if it was a single price and I still might buy a few of the DLCs but what stops the developers from selling future features as DLC? Do I want to invest my time in a program with that possibility or find a replacement?I feel a bit ""deceived"" by the bussiness model of a software that is actually quite user friendly and good. It should have clearly stated ""batteries not included"" in a more visible place.The ""friendly price"" DLC policy can be OK but is not too clear from the top of the store page.I am going to give it a thumbs down mainly for the DLC model, not for the software."

The optimized export features of the Mesh Module I found to be extremely helpful, my models went from 3,051 polys to 551 polys which is fairly notible. Honestly though, I feel rather bittersweet about the upgrade. While in Qubicle 1 I had gotten used to tools and features which I used every single day, having to pay for the Hue/Saturation and other color features seems like a bit overstep on Minddesks part. Although I can understand the business decision and the fact Steam isnt overly friendly to softwares, I am willing to look past it for the opimization and better performance of the standalone application.If you're a casual voxel modeler, I would not recommend this program in it's current state. The added price tag for tools I feel are nessessary for modeling and editing effectively is a bit too much for me to swallow and I feel the average consumer will agree, although the more rounded and experienced voxel modelers like myself will enjoy the opimization and the mesh expansion for ease of use and game creation."

Qubicle would be my editor of choice for its ability to handle multiple matrices and its superior tools for manipulating and editing, unfortunately it severely lacks usability and features when it comes to actual modelling.The editor view supports only flat shading, which sometimes makes it impossible to do complex modeling and understand the geometry. Developers say that they are working on it.. will change my review then.All in all this is a very cool program, if the developers combined the pros of Magika Voxel (better rendering, better modeling flow) it would easily become the standard for voxel art creation!"

,Recommended,454550,22559555,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,crimsonwingzz,"Note: I've been using the trial version (2.5) for a few weeks so this review is based off of that and the current hour that I've been using Qubicle 3.0Qubicle 3.0 is a great program, it's an efficient, easy, and a quick tool to create assets for your games or other things that you may need it for. No technical things are required like UV-Unwrapping or optimizing because the program does it for you! It also has a very clean UI, allowing new users to easily get into the program quickly.However, as much as I would recommend this software, there are quite a few things that I have noticed that have brought up problems for me.Firstly, there are other programs that contain a much cleaner rendering engine (if engine would be the word), programs like MagicaVoxel [free] are one of those, Qubicle's rendering is literally just hiding all of the matrixes, grids, etc. and applying a gradient background. When you render, you can physically see the pixels on the cubes and there isn't that much flexibility for rendering (not sure if intended, could be helpful to some users); but that being said, this can be fixed by just using both tools; exporting from Qubicle and putting the model into MagicaVoxel can bring out some great results.Secondly, Qubicle can at times be difficult to use at some angles, the model can sometimes look like it's 2D and you miss a few blocks because you can't see them and you have to erase and move things around more often (which can rack up in time, and you end up losing hours to just fixing problems because of its viewport), a great fix would definitely be the option to have AO (Ambient Occlussion) in the viewport when editing.Thirdly, the payment methods have definitely struck a problem for me, as it's quite confusing and you end up spending more money for the Steam edition (unless you buy it before 4/28/2016). Currently there are 25% off and 15% off the DLCs, and DLCs is exactly what I'm going to talk about. When you purchase the program on their site, you can use the program without the use of Steam and you end up saving more money; plus you get all of the features without having to get ""DLCs"". With the Steam edition, you have to buy the DLCs to unlock features that are quite crucial for a game artist; yes, they are quite cheap, but it's still quite tedious and annoying, and in the end (when there are no sales) you are not saving any money on the Steam edition, you end up paying up to $15-20 more than the Indie/Pro edition, to some people that's nothing, but to some smaller indie developers who are tight on cash, it can raise a problem.The price is pretty fair now, unlike before where you could not sell your products commercially whatsoever unless you paid extra, now it's $80k and then you can pay for the commercial DLC, which sounds perfect to me. The program is growing, and I really hope they can add a few more things like better rendering and AO, but in the current state its in, I think it's still a top notch program. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to make a game with a Voxel artstyle.Rating so far: 8/10"

If you don't know what voxels are then look at the screenshots :DThe main concern for a lot of people will be how does it stack up against the excellent free tool Magicavoxel.Well, magicavoxel looks a lot nicer and has a perspective camera for editing, has a really nice built in ray-casting renderer, can export optimized meshes and voxelize 3d models as standard, can render and export marching cube models (smoothed out cubes).Qubicle can edit larger models though. Magicavoxel is limited to 126x126x126. Qubicle allows you to make large models from lots of smaller pieces. This feature is coming in the next version of magicavoxel but is not available yet.So, qubicle, pros and cons:pro:Can edit large models made up of smaller parts. (This is a very important pro).con:Expensive if you get all the dlcSomewhat tacky that if you don't have the dlc you have locked off, padlocked options on the menus to remind you that you don't own the full product. (Although this does tie in to the way the program lets you test drive the features you don't have).You pretty much have to get the utility dlc because otherwise you don't get the mirror tools, the box select and the paint select. Without these select tools for example it's impossible to move the legs on the reindeer test model because the magic wand and rectangle select both select more than you want.Voxelizer dlc seems to be broken at the moment. I imported a simple house .obj and 2 walls and 1/4 of the roof were missing in addition to some other polygons around the door frame. Also voxelizer seems to be limited to 100x100x100 which is even smaller than magicavoxel allows.I also tried a 3d tank model and it left some faces off that too and it crashed when changing the scale.No perspective camera makes editng confusing sometimes.Single developer, infrequent updates, slow to add features. If there's some feature you really want it's more likely to be in the next version of the software that you won't get as owner of this version."
