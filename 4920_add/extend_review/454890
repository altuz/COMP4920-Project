The warnings are true. High risk of epilepsy if you see those red-yellow triangles and thousands of flashing dots. Most remarkable for the game is the tiny base picture (480x360) which you can upscale over F to fullscreen (maybe it's just for the performance) Then everything seems pixelated but still very unique graphics. And the soundtrack loops are brilliant. There are many objects on screen at the same time. Ofc you can only win if you are able to dodge them. Your ship has a powercore which shouldn't be hit. Thankfully there's XBox Controller support and the controls are very precise.The game uses its own codes to announce powerups. Shield means extralife and the red/green mushroom is a continue with another 5 lives. There was a little confusion about the bosses. Chtulhu is the green goblin, Satan the scythe throwing skeleton and God the yellow pyramid with the eye. You have to survive 5(!) rounds against those superbosses. The others just need 3.After beating the main game 3 times you unlock bossrun and hardcore mode. Especially in hardcore mode you have only a one-hit-life. In bossrun mode you have to beat 5 normal bosses and all 3 superbosses in a row to get the last achievement. This game is pretty cool as it sounds and has very challenging modes."

I would have happily payed full price for this game if I knew the joys it would bring. As I first started playing, it was kind of tough, but I'm getting better over time. The soundtrack is amazing, and I actually look forward to hearing it when I load up the game (unlike most games.) The developers are very responsive and care about their customers. So if there are any problems you encounter, they'd likely be happy to help."
,Recommended,454890,33798913,Posted: 25 July,all,S0YxSauCe,Its one of those weird crazy game. The boss rush mode is my favourite simply because its amazing and you will feel the energy rush. Its easy game too. Enjoy it.
,Recommended,454890,27926323,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,KidwithSmurf,"When I first saw this, I thought it’d be just another cheap “Bullet Hell” game that doesn’t add anything to the genre. However, after playing it for the first time, I couldn’t stop and here’s why:Pros:♦ No bugs (Despite some reviews saying the game has bugs, I have played three hours and have not come across a bug)♦ Awesome TV Effect that can be turned on and off (This is amazing for those who want to play Arcade Machine Retro Style, there is the choice to do so or not)♦ Amazing Voice Overs (Every game should have Voice Overs and the Voice Overs in this fit the genre perfectly)♦ Music and Sounds are eargasmic (The music isn’t distracting and really adds to the feel of the game and the sound effects also fit really well with the genre and game)♦ Hitbox is on point (This has to have one of the best hitboxes I’ve seen in a “Bullet Hell” game)♦ Graphics are awesome (Has that Retro, Arcade Machine, old-school look and feel to it which I find amazing in “Bullet Hell” games)♦ Has Steam Trading Cards and Achievements (For the price of the game, the cards almost pay for the game and the achievements are easily gotten for just playing the game, there is no rocket science behind unlocking them)♦ Worth the Price (You’ll get your monies worth easily if you enjoy classic “Bullet Hell” games and if you don’t the Steam Trading Cards will almost pay for the game)♦ Decent number of game modes (If you want to play with lives you can, if you want to play with no lives you can, just versing bosses you can, easy or hard?, there’s a game mode almost for everyone)♦ Randomness done well (Every time you play you’ll rarely get the same set of enemies, powerups or bosses twice in a row. For example, you play and die, then play again, you’ll have a different set of enemies, powerups and bosses etc)♦ Number of powerups and enemy varients are great (Never know what you’re going to verse or get powerup wise each playthrough, which is decent)♦ Mad Events keep the game interesting (Mad Events randomly happen and adds a whole new aspect to the game from just shooting enemies and killing bosses. These keep the game interesting)♦ Controls seem responsive (From what I've played, I haven't noticed an issue with the controls not responding or feeling jerky)Cons:♦ Slow game launcher (Takes a long time to open the game client after clicking play)♦ No in-game options (Can’t alter resolution, sound, graphics or change controls)♦ Must use a controller to be able to player any sort of local co-op (This is annoying because you should be able to use the same keyboard, a second keyboard or anything. It shouldn’t be forced to a controller)♦ Can’t change controls (I found the pre-set controls to be decent, however for those who want to change them for whatever reason can’t)♦ Help menu could be improved (The help menu is bad as it doesn’t describe any of the in-game powerups, bosses, enemies, mad-events or anything except controls. Therefore, you must go in and figure everything out for yourself. Some people like figuring it out for themselves, others like to know before they go in. There should be the option)♦ Some Mad Events are way harder than others (This is bad because there is no difficulty scaling of Mad Events. This means despite the mode chosen, for example, “Easy” mode rather than “Hard, you could get a really difficult Mad Event for your first Mad Event on “Easy” and a really easy one for your first Mad Event on “Hard” mode. Mad Events are random, but they should scale depending on the mode, level etc)♦ Sometimes things blend into the background (This doesn’t happen too often, but it can happen depending on the spawns and how crazy the game gets)Overall, despite there being a few cons, they are only minor and there are more pros. Therefore, this is one of the best Retro, Arcade Machine and Old-School styled “Bullet Hell” games with one of the best hit boxes that I’ve seen in a long time. Also, as you’ll get your monies worth whether you play it or just get the cards, I can recommend picking up a copy of this game at any price."
,Recommended,454890,24080131,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,King Renly Baratheon,"Project Starship is one of the best games you can get for $1. although I usually don't like arcade shoot em ups, I really like this game. but it has a few small problems. but none of them stop this game from being one of the best games for such a cheap price.PRESENTATION:Project Starship's presentation is really good.the effects are nice , the character designs are okay.but where it really shines is in the music department. the soundtrack is really good and memorable.the enemy design and variety is also good. the special effects are nicely done and have that retro feel.Sound effects are pretty good too.GAMEPLAY:The Gameplay is really nice and simple. but I was disappointed that there was no difference between two characters during gameplay. the enemy variety is good and the boss battle was good too. but the easy mode is a little bit too easy because you get the powerups too easily. While the hard mode is a way better experience. it would have been better if there was a normal mode. but since the game is new , it might receive an update adding these things. the powerups are varied and also have a different feel to each of them and work well. the game also feels intense thanks to so many enemies on screen. The mad events are also really nice and hard.VERDICT:Project Starship is one of the better indie games available for a Dollar. the gameplay is nice and the soundtrack is great. although I would have like a few more characters and a better difficulty settingFor such a cheap price you cannot go wrong with this one."

,Recommended,454890,22933775,"Posted: 12 May, 2016",all,ghostornamental,"nice game! I've played more than it appears in offline mode, and must say it's worth at least 5 times what they charge for it. serene music, delightfully weird bosses, cool powerup system, an element of randomness, and the mspaint vibe calls to mind another hidden indie shmup gem which sadly hasn't appeared on Steam, the aptly-named Mother ♥♥♥♥er Galaxy. I really recommend Project Starship as an inexpensive diversion for vertical shmup fans; it outclasses several games that cost far, far more (like, for example, buy this 15 times rather than Hurricane of the Varstray once :p )."
,Recommended,454890,24186116,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Stwff,"Boy oh boy this game.Let's start with the basics.Project Starship is a Bullet Hell game, which means that it involves, you guessed it, a hell lot of bullets.The menu interface is really simple. The title at the top of the screen and ""Press enter to start"", with some gameplay in the background. Nothing less, nothing more. Really simple. When you press enter you are presented with two characters to play with, a male and a female. I can't exactly say if this decision is important since I just tried one character but it's better to point it out. After you choose your character you can either choose to play on Easy mode (not so easy after a couple of minutes of playtime) and Hard Mode (which features more bullets).After the difficulty setting the game starts.Your sprite (the starship) has a little dot in the middle: that's what you are going to desperatly defend. If a bullet hits the starship sprite nothing happens, but if a bullet hits the little dot you lose a shield (aka a life).Counting that you start with not-so-many of those shields and that you can aquire more of them RANDOMLY means that you want to be really careful not to get hit, otherwise, if you lose all your shields, it's game over and you start from the beginning. Most of the times, your movement need to be precise or you lose a shield, and that's what the shift button (or slow down button) is for: it allows you to slow down your movements to make more precise ones.In the high right corner there's a Score counter: the more hits you get on the enemies and the more points you get.During your game time, you can obtain various power ups, as well as abilities that can be used with the spacebar, to facilitate your way into the game.Everything is completely random: random enemies will spawn, random object/powerups will be unlocked and random bosses will be fought. This leads to a great replay ability, not an excellent one though. The game can be pretty addictive, that's true, but it can become boring really fast too, depending on your tastes in video games.The game is 2D, so there's not so much to talk about regarding performances and the technical sector.The game runs at 30 fps, which can be bothersome since it's a bullet hell game. When you slow down, the framerate drops to an even lower one, effectively slowing the game time itself and making it easier to dodge bullets.The flashy graphics can annoy someone, and cause more problems to other who suffer from seizures, but this stands out as soon as the game starts, because there a disclaimer noting this.Another problem is that the player's bullets cover the enemies bullets, making it hard to understand what exactly is going on. Sometimes, enemies that went pass the player and beyond the screen can still shoot bullets, unpredictable ones at this matter, risking to waste precious shields even if the player is not at fault.OPINION TIMEOverall, the game is fantastic. it keeps you glued to the monitor if you like it, and the simple yet flashy stile can be appreciated at times and distracting others.I'm not a fan of scores, but if I really had to, I'd give this game a 7/10. Nothing too special, but a really nice game to pass time.Also there's an achievement called ""IT WAS ME, DIO!"" so this makes it a perfect 10/10 buy this gem."

From what I've seen, they play the same, but have different voices and different colored ships (Garret is blue, Gwen is red).You collect powerups to upgrade your ship such as increasing its rate of fire, power, aesthetics, etc. Idk what the story of the game is but basically you fly around and annihilate all enemies on the screen. You occassionally have ""MAD EVENTS"" which are basically minigames that give you a rare powerup on completion. There's also bosses, but I don't know how many since I can't get past the 2nd boss :(It's a hard game, but very fun and the soundtrack is kickass (soundtrack DLC when??). I paid basically 4 cents for it, worth every penny (lol)EDIT 7/17: Forgot to mention that THIS GAME SUPPORTS LOCAL MULTIPLAYER!! Either KB and 360 controller or two 360 controllers, on the 360 controller press Select."

Some pros and cons have been updated.PROS:-really great bullet hell game. Classically styled-bitty-space-etheral enemies-neat pixel animations-steam achievements-very well done audiowork. Doesn't feel like the songs are choppy/cut to the next one. They blend well and don't get annoying, match the game well.-can hold down fire key-can get some sick demonic/internety upgrades-can get regular standard upgrades too-got it for 8 cents alongside 3 other games (presumably from the same publisher/developer, haven't checked)-""mad events""-multiple lives (on easy)CONS:-no controls screen, a controls screen would be nice before blasting into a bullet hell-no sound/volume options, volume options other than windows mixer would be nice. I want to listen to my music but still have the in game sound effects-non-scalable window nor options pre-loader, unlike many unity games-bullets can be hard to see due to the background, a more simplistic background would benefit my sight (window size is a contributing factor, as aforementioned)-effing steam notifications impair my ability to play the game, a friend comes online and 1/12th of my screen in a BULLET HELL is completely obstructed from view-early on your character can seem pretty op. Dodging is a little too easy (on easy)-multiple lives (on easy)It's not as bad as the outweigh of cons make it out to be. It's really fun and well made, the cons are only minor drawbacks. Adds more of a challenge."

The thrill of hiding from every single bullet on the screen while tearing space enemies apart?Well, Project Starship is that on steroids. The game is really fast, and pretty challenging, even if you are on the easy mode doing your best to survive. Chances are, you will get obliterated by any tiny little thing you didn't see on the screen while trying to avoid hordes of energy shots directed at you.The game is really fun, and for the price I got it at, it's pretty much a steal.10/10, would use ""IMA FIRING MAH LAZOR"" again."

You pilot a little spaceship through pixelated waves of enemies, which are varied enough and shoot out difficult enough patterns to keep you entertained and dodging. Music is also incredibly awesome and really fits the mood well.My only complaint is the stupid ""MAD EVENT"" that makes it impossible to see the screen and turns your controls backwards.My other complaint is that the ship likes to go to ""neutral"" before changing directions, which makes it impossible to execute quick left-right-left-right dodges like you can in other bullet hell games. Makes the controls feel a tad clunky."

This game stands up with some of the bullet-hell classice IMHO."

Yeah ""swaggy"", that was one of the many things that this game has tought me.But worry not, I won't harsh this games buzz by spoiling the lessons it has to impart. One more thing, this game is harder than a priest in a daycare. Enjoy.Give it a go."

Good graphics,nice sound effects and the music even reacts to you getting hit or getting a power up. A great waste of time. If you have some spare change or just sold some cards actually consider this game."

,Not Recommended,454890,34131776,Posted: 9 August,all,ZSST,"Don't buy this game just because it is cheap, that was my mistake. The game isn't terrible, but there are few drawbacks like - the enemy bullets sometimes mix just too well with the background. There are places where the bullets are almost impossible to dodge since they're unpredictable. Also I miss some sort of real tutorial (it even took me a while to realise, that I have to press F1 for controls). I do like, however, the way they did that old school TV style and the soundtrach is really good. The game is super hard too."

,Recommended,454890,33636400,Posted: 18 July,all,...,"La mayor parte del tiempo sentirás que pilotas una nave sobre hielo. El control se vuelve demasiado veloz para la velocidad de las balas a esquivar, generando una contradicción entre posibilidades de movimiento que el juego te ofrece y lo que mecánicamente te exige.Si le das la oportunidad y te acostumbras a esto, Project Starship es un juego decente. El estilo retro le da un toque nostálgico tan manoseado estos días, pero que no termina de fallar; y la música, si bien puede volverse repetitiva, no interrumpe el juego con un sonido irritante. Además, hay power ups y vidas repartidas aleatoriamente para apoyar la batalla y alargar el juego arcade.Si logras superar el pilotaje resbaladizo, Project Starship resulta un juego divertido. Si bien no entrega nada nuevo, lo que copia lo entrega de manera eficaz."
