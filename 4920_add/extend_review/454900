,Recommended,454900,33004881,Posted: 29 June,all,TEKnowledgy,"For a little old school feeling indie and 89 cent price tag (steam summer sale) I felt it was a good investment for little bit of casual fun. I felt like I was in the 80s again. There was 3 modes of play Normal, Legendary which added like a ""hardcore effect"" say if you die it is game over and also gave bonuses to weapons drops. Then elite mode which said infinite waves and leader board access (i didn't try it yet, but from what it sounds like it seems to be a survival mode)I did manage to get into the warp mini-game/puzzle it was fun as well. More of a timing thing, you got little gaps you must get through as the level seems to speed up, making these gaps harder and harder to get through. Touch top or bottom of this gap and instant death, you have to restart level, complete the warp and you get a shiny. The levels themselves are randomly generated, which is good if you find yourself wanting to farm weapons and/or money a little per level wont be so repetitive with that randomly generated level system.Further more each weapon you pick up is based on the level you are on on. Level 1 you pick up level 1 weapons so on and so on. Higher the level of weapon the more energy it needs and the more DPS it will do. Money system allows you to buy more shield (basically health) and more energy for the weapon requirements.The weapons you loot have 3 rarities that I've seen so far, you have common whites, rare purples and legendary gold. Your ship is capable of holding 3 weapons, each weapon has it's own style of effect. You got your low damage rapid firing guns got manually guided missiles, a gun I'd say like a slow firing laser beam or maybe it is meant to resemble a rail gun, as it seemed to kill enemy and continue onward. There was a few others types aswell.As for story, yeah they tossed in a little bit of a plot. I guess to give the game a little more meaning to it all, but don't buy this game for a story you might be let down deeply in that area. If you are buying it make sure it is a type of genre you actually just enjoy playing, because that is pretty much all you are getting. (in my case I was fine with that) I just wanted a little pass time. Usually i don't play games like this, it has been a good 10 or more years since i played a side scrolling space shooter.I forgot to mention, you can 1 hand this game. The ship is controlled with mouse movement and mouse 1 is constant fire, so its really simple and easy to control your ship no keyboard required. (1 hand to puff on your blunt or hold a beer lol maybe rub on your honey a little w/e you need a free hand for, you have it  ;) )Overall i enjoyed my time spent, I'll probably spend a little more time in the future. If you are into this genre, give it a whirl."

It's a throw back to some of my favorite console games (think R-Type or Thunder Force). The sound track is great, and the ability to find new weapons and improve your ship is awesome. The levels are always different as well in terms of the lay out of enemies so you aren't always subjected to the same static layouts that you may be used to seeing with these games. the controls for this game are also very simple and easy to get used to. The only thing that is slightly lame about this game is maybe the backgrounds you see while playing, since they are mostly very similar and kind of boring, but that would be a shallow reason for not at least giving this game a try. This game is a steal of a deal - you won't regret it!"

Doesn't have much replay value, unless you really like competing for position in Leaderboard.A few things in UI are not obvious:1) You can replay previous levels by pressing left arrow on ""audio casette"", so there is a possibility of grinding for money, you can never be really stuck (although I didn't find it necessary on Normal difficulty)2) To fight the final boss after you have collected all Dark Matter you need, press a small red lever on the right side of ""casette"" (it should be blinking)."

Nastiest boss fight so far this year!Graphics: 80%Audio: 80%Gameplay: 75%Replayability: 50%Value for money: 100%Overall: 77%Audio and graphics is ok for an indie game. Good music, and sound effects are as they should be. One of the tunes doesn't loop very well. But that's a minor issue. I feel there could be a bit more varied graphics in different backgrounds and such. As it is now, each level feels the same. Just harder mobs.I was surprised that it was mouse controlled. I haven't played a mouse-shooter since the Amiga days. And this one utilizes the mouse 100%. No lag, and you feel the ship flies where you want it.As for content, the game tends to be a bit repetetive. But the developer doesn't drag it on forever for us that want to complete it once. I beat the boss on easiest difficulty after 1,5 hour. I had to farm a little bit to get my shields up to 1000. But then I had kinda learned how to avoid the different attacks. Still good to have a buffer. Good thing you didn't have to start all over when you died, as the boss was one of the most difficult encounters I've battled in a long while.I was a bit dissapointed of the gear though. All the guns fire forward, and there is no difference in how they fire. I boils down to just get the guns that has the highest dps you can fit with your power. It's like the loot of borderlands, but with less detail. And it's kinda awkward that even the bullets follow your ship vertically instead of going straight forward. But that's just nitpicking.Will this last, then? I doubt I will play it much more after this. The final Achiements are winning on legend and getting to level 20 on legend. I guess that is doable with a lot of grinding and careful play, but I feel this isn't worth my time. But others may try getting further and further. If only the weapons and levels were a bit more diverse... The high-score attack in the ""Elite"" game is fun a couple of times, but nothing more.Finally, was it worth my money? I got it 50% off, and it was enganging for 1,5 hour. I would even say it's worth picking up at full price."

Easy mouse control, nice music and great graphism.You can redo any stage you've completed to gain more money for your shield or the energy of your ship to equip better weapons that your enemies drop. There are different weapons to equip on your ship (3 slots - up, middle and down) and some combinations are really nice. Honestly, you have to try this one."
,Not Recommended,454900,23974210,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Therac-25,"Good idea, but falls down in a couple of key places.1) The loot variation is not nearly interesting enough, and the weapons are not different enough to matter.  It becomes just getting the biggest number, no thought to playstyle.2) The actual game is very frustrating.  The enemies that use fast/hitscan laser weapons will do a warmup cycle that shows their thing warming up, and most of the ships will give some kind of indication that they're about to do their (very rapid) attack.  So, you want to keep your eyes predominantly on the playfield watching for incoming threats.   The *problem* is that the bullets and attacks tend to be very unpredictable, so you need to watch what's going on around the ship.  The experience of having to need to look in two places at once to avoid damage results in the experience of watching the playfield, only to have unpredictable bullet sprays and other ships run into yours, and then moving your eye over there and being hit by rapid attacks that you couldn't easily anticipate.Good shooters are built on memorization of patterns.  Even randomized shooters likeSteredenn(which I'd recommend instead of this game) give you enemies that are predictable, so you can take advantage of muscle memory.  This game is just flailing around with no pattern, so you never have anything to build off of."

,Recommended,454900,33612885,Posted: 17 July,all,Zonrith,"Overall, this is a pretty fun shoot 'em up. Mouse control of the ship was very responsive, the auto-fire feature much appreciated, and the randomized level design meant even when I replayed a stage I might see a dramatically different experience. I found it pretty challenging (though admittedly I failed to realize that pumping excess energy into weapon slots gave me more DPS, so I may have given myself a bigger challenge than intended). I played through and won twice (normally and then on the Legend mode).Only complaint is the music. I like it, just a pity that the looping aspect is so obvious. A very minor issue; overall this is definitely worth playing if you like horizontally scrolling shooters!"
,Not Recommended,454900,28215436,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,䷃䷋䷃䷏䷀ ䷴䷼䷝,"Not very difficult really. You may need to repeat a couple of levels early on to get your armour and weapons suitably upgraded, but once you've got adequate armour and weapons you're pretty much unstoppable. The unusual mouse control pretty much allows you to zip to any spot on the screen instantaneously making avoiding enemy projectiles pretty easy, and even if you do get hit it won't bother you much if you've been upgrading your armour.There's a variety of weapons, but the differences are mostly cosmetic as they all shoot straight forward. One has a small scatter arc, and one shoots through enemies, but really there's no real strategy to selecting weapons aside from going for the maximum damage per second you have points for.The warp sections were fun and challenging, just beware that if you fail, that's it. Early in the game it's worth taking the risk, but later in the game you'll have pretty powerful weaponry anyway.Randomly generated attack waves keep things interesting, but after a few levels you've seen all the enemies the game will throw at you, you just keep going against the same foes each level only slightly powered up. There are couple of sub-boss type enemies to keep things interesting, but these won't offer much more challenge than the rest of the enemies.Won't take you very long until you've beaten the boss on hard mode. I can take him fairly easily between level 20-30. I did have a little fun with this, but don't think I can recommend it. Oh, and it has an unskippable intro, I hate those.6.9/10"

I wish there was a bit more variance in the firing patterns of different weapons; they all stay more or less in the same lane as it is, which means there's not a lot of chance to really change your playstyle based on scatter and suchlike."
