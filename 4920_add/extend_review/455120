,Not Recommended,455120,26036138,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,Reggie Fils-Anime,"(NOTE: This review was done in the singleplayer experience - NOT COOP (However hopefully this review will stop you from wanting to even play this game with a friend))This game............ sucks. It's bad. Like really bad. If you don't want to read my entire review, here is a summary:This game is exactly the same as those hundreds of terrible greenlight horror games on Steam. It is not unique, it is boring and it is garbage. It's like a kid's first attempt at making a game, and it is laughable that the devs are actually charging $9 for this crap. When I've seen Happy Meal toys offer a more fulfilling experience.If you want me to list out all the terrible things in this game. Here is a few:1. The monsters. This is a joke. Remember how I said how un-unique this game is? Well, the enemies in this game are the most cliched and pathetic excuses for horror enemies I've ever seen. The game offers a huge selection of TWO enemy types. A mannequin (never seen that before: Silent Hill, Kraven Manor  ) which you need to look at for it not to kill you (100% original. Not just like: The Weeping Angles or SCP-173). And the second enemy type is one that won't see you if you have your flashlight off (Which is like nearly EVERY HORROR GAME EVER). However, the game didn't even do that part right. At least in most horror games like Amnesia, you can turn off lights to lower your chance of being found. BUT IN THIS GAME, you can literally go up to the monsters and suck their d*ck, just as long as your light is off. They're completely static and don't even attempt to kill you.2. It's stupid riddles. You're asked a total of I believe 12 riddles in this game in order to progress. Somewhat like a troll under the bridge sorta thing. However, this is honestly one of the laziest excuses at a bloody 'puzzle' I've ever seen. All the riddles you are asked, have NOTHING to do with the story. They offer NO explanation in the story, they offer NO personality of our characters, they have NOTHING to do with the game at all (other than to try to pad out your game time so you cannot refund the game). And the worse thing? They're all unoriginal. All the riddles in this game were completely ripped from online. The creators of this game didn't even TRY to create their own original riddles. They instead chose to steal them instead because their brains were rotted from Year 3's math homework.3. The game is ugly. Visually it's gross. The game is too bloody dark so if your light is off you have no idea where you are going. The game looks like a collection of free-to-download assets all plunked down on a level editor. And the game uses so many stock-font choices it looks like the game was written using Microsoft Word 2007.4. The story is non-existant. NOTHING, in the game, is explained. Nothing is resolved, nothing is revealed, nothing happens. What happened to that couple? NEVER FOUND OUT. Why are their monsters? NOT EXPLAINED. Whats with all the bodybags? NEVER ANSWERED. I'm fine with games leaving things open for interpretation. But there's a difference between leaving things ambiguous for analysis, and being too lazy to answer things yourselves.5. The game is pathetic. This is how I feel about the game the most. It's pathetic. It's got pathetic graphics, it's got pathetic programming, it's got a pathetic story, the list goes on. The devs did not try. This feels like college students first attempt at making a game. WHICH IS FINE. But don't bloody dare to charge babies first game for $9.  Which ironically is higher then the production budget of the game itself. If this game was free on Indie GoGo - sure. That would be fine. But the fact that this game made it on the Steam Page, really says a lot about greenlight.I could rag on the terrible things in this game for dozens of more hours. Such as how slow your character moves, the fact that enemies can literally be placed behind a corner so you have no idea there is one up ahead and you die, the terrible overworld which offers like 5 locations, the lack of music or overall ambiance. But, that would be putting in more effort than the devs did to this entire game.This game is a joke. For all those horror nutters looking for that hidden unique indie horror game like myself, move along. You've played this game before.And to the devs, listen, I don't want to discourage you making games. In-fact, I want to encourage you to better yourself from this experience. Just please, try something new, try to increase your level of quality. I've got faith in you guys and I hope you can better yourselves.Unfortunately, this game is bad and if you somehow couldn't guess it, I strongly DO NOT recommend this game. 'Stay FAR' away from this game."
,Not Recommended,455120,26034871,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,Moathinos,"Going into this game my expectations were already at rock bottom, what with the dev being unresponsive to valid questions and eating up unwarrented praise for a game that hasn't even been released. After a whopping 4 delays with no real reason given or details about said delays, the game was finally released. Even with my expectations set so low the game still managed to shock me with how bad it is, firstly your character seems to be some sort of geriatric escaped from the nursing home because they move so painfully slowly. The first NPC you encounter may aswell be a static model, he has no life to him or even a facial expression, after you answer his three simple riddles you're instructed to go the apartment buildings, easy enough to find seeing as the place is so small. During my exploration I found a small building with a very unresponsive monster inside of it who would just run at you with his hands covering his head, but if you put a small amount of distance between you and him, he just gives up immediately and stands back into position, doing absolutely nothing. Second type of enemy you will encounter is the typical 'look away and it moves' sort of enemy, except it doesn't follow those rules at all, it will move even when it is still in your line of sight, once again like the previous enemy it will patrol back to it's original position and stand still again with a short amount of distance. I couldn't bring myself to play anymore of this poor excuse for a game after seeing what I'd be experiencing throughout the playthrough, so I quit and refunded it immediately. This belongs in early access, not a full release. Straight garbage in it's current state, do not buy."

That being said, once you figure out the mechanics, the game becomes less scary and more about working together (if youre playing coop, didnt play singleplayer) which in my opinion, made the game more fun. I got this game on sale and I say it was worth it for a sale price."
76561198048974498,Not Recommended,455120,32346035,Posted: 11 June,all,rjmacready,"Well, this one's quite the curiosity piece. Attempts at multiplayer horror games generally are, but...this one, if nothing else, deserves to be applauded for at least avoiding the obvious tropes. Including, unfortunately, the ones which would probably be required for a multiplayer horror game to ever WORK.Allow me to recount my first ""playthrough"". Granted, it was a single player one, but a quick look at other reviews suggests that the experience is precisely the same any-which way. Except that in multiplayer you have a buddy to SHARE the shiteness with.First up, the loading screen is of such an interminable length that I began to wonder if the game or my computer had frozen. Nope, we got there eventually. And where did we get to, exactly? Erm...an alleyway of sorts, with some black body bags on stretchers. Fair enough. A good enough start for a horror game in my book, and the graphics are nice enough. So I read a note, and on its advice, begin looking for some guy named Cyrus.Walking. Ahem, yes. Quite the creepy experience, though not necessarily in ways which were intended by the developers. Firstly, your footsteps are ten times quieter than the sound made when you click your flashlight on and off, and secondly, they PAN AROUND you when you move the mouse. So it almost sounds like you're being followed, and then you stop moving and realise it was your own, erm, third leg perhaps. Eerie, yes, though perhaps not for the right reasons.After wandering in a moody circle around a single block (the ""city"" you're in doesn't seem to consist of much else), you finally see a light on in a building with an old-ish man who must be this alleged Cyrus standing there, like a statue, just waiting to be walked up and talked to. More than happy to oblige, Mr Creepy-Trousers! Now here's the kicker: you walk up to Cyrus, and lo and behold, the man starts to ask you RIDDLES! Not even super-easy, multi-choice riddles, but ones you have to type in on the screen.Now I'm all for co-op games getting away from the expected frag-fest and/or stealth-and-survive antics which we've all come to expect, but I find it a stretch to believe that the Call of Duty generation are going to get their online multiplayer kicks from answering riddles about weather and architecture with their mates. It should certainly take trolling to new heights: ""U r so fuken♥♥♥♥♥♥at PUZLES m8...lern to pzle♥♥♥♥♥♥""In any case, your reward for getting three puzzles correct is to be sent on an object-fetching mission by the ever-enigmatic Cyrus (who only speaks to you via telepathy, it seems, as there is no voice-acting to speak of). Off it is, then, to an apartment block of some description.Fortunately, it doesn't take long to guess which building I'm supposed to walk into, given that it's the only one with an open door, and the fact that the spooky white mist which filled it earlier now appears to be gone. Walk in and...bingo! We have spooky mannequin...repeat, we have spooky mannequin! So it IS a horror game after all (thank ♥♥♥♥ for that). I turn my back on said mannequin for a moment, and oh...spooky mannequin has moved! Fortunately, I've already played a (much, much better) game called Statues, so I know how this mischief works. I keep her in sight, and she quickly gives up the chase anyway. Up to the next floor of the building it is, then.There's something up here, something growling. I enter a bedroom, so far so good...dunno where that monster is...walk a bit up a corridor, turn to look left into a doorway. AAAARGGH! Monster kills me, and the game informs me that ""You have turned into a resident"", whatever the ♥♥♥♥ that means. Then my computer crashes, and I have to restart the bloody thing.Shall I humour it a second time? Sure. Only seems fair. And I do seem to recall the words ""Game saved"" when I walked into the cafe or whatnot to greet Cyrus. Ah yes, a ""Continue"" option on the menu screen. Let's hit that then. Shouldn't take me back TOO far in the gameplay, and...oh. I seem to be back in the alleyway with the body bags again. Maybe the game just starts you back in that one place every time, and I don't have to do the Cyrus bit again; that's acceptable, I guess.No such dice. One oddly familiar conversation and three extremely familiar riddles later, and I'm off to the apartment building again. In-between plays, I've taken the liberty of having a quick look at some reviews on the Store page, and found out you can in fact avoid being insta-killed by the second floor beastie by putting into practice the exact OPPOSITE theory which I used on the mannequin, i.e. DON'T look at the monster and flash the flashlight in its face. Okay, fair enough. I don't recall seeing a note or anything which hinted at this theory, but I'll go with it, and see how far I get this time.Lo and behold, I do successfully pass by the beastie on the second floor! Only to walk straight onto the third floor and flash my light in the eyes of another identical beastie, who promptly insta-kills me and crashes my computer again.Upon restarting my computer for the second time, I promptly uninstall.Two things about game design here (and I'm not even going to stoop to mention the multiple crashes herein). Firstly, if you're going to make enemies insta-kill people if certain ""rules"" aren't followed, you might want to hint to the player what those rules are. Having said that, a ""trial-and-error"" theory is to some degree also potentially acceptable, but ONLY if such cheap deaths are immediately preceded by a FUNCTIONING SAVE POINT. As it stands, this game has way too many problems, both in its design and technical execution, to be remotely worthy of my time.None of which is to say that this game couldn't be revamped into an at least passable fright-fest. The mood is at least part-way there, the monsters are at least interesting, and the sound...well, that can always be fixed. If the devs are willing to fix the myriad problems this game evidences, I may be prepared to give it another burl (and lucky for them, I'm plainly-and-simply not the ""refunding"" type). Judging by the lazy effort we have here, however, I'll be positively gob-smacked if the devs are willing to make the monumental effort required to repair this product, so I'm guessing it'll just end up being yet another less-than-passable effort languishing in my library.Oh well. At least the game comes with trading cards, so it wasted neither a significant amount of my time or money. The search for a genuinely scary and compelling multiplayer horror game continues. Good thing I recently bought all that scuba gear, 'cause it looks like I'm gonna be holding my breath for a long, long time...Verdict: 4/10.UPDATE: I actually wrote the above review around the time of the game's initial release, in October of last year, and recently dug it up from my files realising I'd never posted it. To maintain my integrity as a reviewer - Lord forbid that should ever be questioned! - I thought I should quickly turn the game on and see if anything had changed. The answer is yes, and for the better! But, er...only very slightly better. After dying you now reappear with Cyrus (no game crashes), and don't have to answer his questions again. The mannequin also seems to have mysteriously vanished from the apartment block (no idea why), and in its place we get the other creatures all the sooner. I still experienced at least two instances where I walked blindly into said monsters - due to my obvious reluctance to turn on the flashlight - and instantly became a ""resident"" for my accidental troubles. So yup...it's still a bit of an unfair, incomprehensible mess, but at least it's creeping closer to something vaguely playable. That said, it remains to be seen how much effort the devs put in from this point forward to make that a reality.REVISED VERDICT: 4.5/10."

Are you looking forward to watch how bad you and your friend are when it comes to solving riddles? This might be the game you're looking for.INTRODUCTION:Stay Close is a nice looking pet project. Even though it's pretty short game, you'll love every second of it.GAME ITSELF:You and your friend are playing as a married couple. You are lost in some kind of abandoned town and apparently, you meet some weird guy called Cyrus. The room where he is is something like the ""hub"". There he gives you tasks to do. From finding his compass to looking for other survivors. He also gives you some riddles to solve and you need to solve them in order to proceed.The game also gives you an option to play it entirely in single player.RESIDENTSDuring your play, you will definitely meet some creepy guys. Some of them are just lurking around, some of them are staying still and when you don't expect it they run towards you. These are called Residents. They are looking very creepy and it's even worse when you hear their noise and you don't see them. You will have to find a way to get across them (and believe me, it's pretty hard sometimes).PROSCo-Op Horror gameGameplay time (Even though it's pretty short game it's pretty hard to get through some parts. For example I have been playing it for almost 7 hours and still haven't finished it)Developer is great guy - there was a great update which made the game even better (he added a new Resident, improved the performance of the game and he supports languages! I've heard that the Czech language is coming soon and you don't hear that every day here in the Czech Republic)CONSShort game (when you know how to get through some parts)SUMMARYThe game has a lot to offer. Great gameplay, great A.I., great performance - the game runs smoothly. Even though the story is kinda short, it's worth playing. I am highly recommending this game to anyone that loves playing with their friends.MY RATING: 97%"

I let out an geniune sound of fear at one point.I'll start with the bad. The beginning of the game is intensely frustrating. It says that the game is saved when I enter the riddle room, but then I go back to the start at each death. I dont know if this is intended but it is frustrating to the point where I wanted to stop playing. The game also either crashes on death, or makes you wait an extremely long time/makes you tab out and back in to respawn (or should I say, restart the mundane first few minutes). The footstep sound honestly brings me out of the game. It doesn't sound like footsteps and the sound continues playing for a second after you stop walking/runnning.The good: Game runs great for me on a gtx 760. No stuttering or anything, although the sensitivity multiplier seems to be a little too much (mouse at 400 dpi and .5 in game still makes it very sensitive. The sounds (other than footsteps) are pretty darn spooky, including the background noise. The notes, so far, are well written and also pretty spooky. The interactive riddles are pretty fun, except when I have repeated talking to the man ten times in 30 minutes.I really want to be able to play through this game, but the saving and dying and repeating the first part over and over has me yelling at my monitor. I hope it gets patched soon cause like I said, I see a ton of potential."

My friend and I played through in about two hours and we both had a lot of fun doing so, the game is brand new so we expected a few bumps, we managed to find one that bothered us (Falling into a river and unable to get out) but all in all we had tons of fun.I paid $6.50 CAD for the game, it was worth every penny as far as I am concerned and fully intend to give it another go through once it’s updated the way the dev’s say they’re working on.Pros:-	Decently scary-	Good monster sounds-	Great atmospheric music-	Amazing textures in and around the city-	Amazingly well written creepy notes around town-Devs are making realistic promises that seem reasonable and sound like they’ll make the game betterCons-	No voice acting for the conversations that take place-	Character textures are not the best, but not awful-	When speaking, hitting the “next” button didn’t always work, had to hit it a few times through out the game and at one point we skipped where we needed to go, causing us to have to restart from the last save (Save before/after every conversation)So if you’re thinking about getting this game, do it; don’t be a cheap ****, it’s the price of a beer for min. 2 hours of game play with a friend."

I had no lag whatsoever and playing with a buddy who was playing on a laptop, he also had no lag whatsoever. The settings were on high and i had no problem. The objective is pretty clear, If you find the objectives, you kind of have to look around in the world ( hence open world) lol Played an hour of this game and i had a lot of fun, everything ran really smoothly. Had a few jump scares within 5 mins of the game! It was easy to make a lobby with a partner, i saw no major bugs, it was more enjoyable than i thought, just follow the objective directions. For a game thats less than 10 bucks, i think it has a lot of potential. I will do a full review once i play more but so far its scary, straight to the point, and fun.Edit: Expecting this game to be a triple A title will make you sound dumb lol I had no expectations, i just wanted a simple fun horror co-op and thats what this game is, there is room for improvement but almost every game can use some sort of improvement. Please dont buy this game thinking youre getting a 60 dollar game out of this....but it is worth the money, especially when they update it with patches and such.

The trailer does not represent the final product in nearly any way.Seemingly the game has been changed since the early stages of the development process and it has turned into a game with similar gameplay elements to various indie Slenderman games. You're tasked with finding items / areas (similar to the page system in Slenderman), while avoiding the two monsters in the game which have opposing triggers to gain their notice, creating occasional situations where both monsters are in the same narrow passage, making progress impossible.The first enemies, which appear to be vortigaunt (from Half Life 2) wannabes have little sense in their AI but do have interesting design as well as eyes that glow eerily in the dark. The aggressive mannequins (which share the same audio clips as the only other enemy in the game) are easily glitched and manipulated which can make an encounter either impossible or an annoyance where monsters must be kited away from certain areas. Quite often during my coop, 2.2 hour experience with the game, the mechanics of both enemy types were easily manipulated to the point where the enemies became 'broken'.Cyrus' writing is awful and clunky while being riddled with grammatical and structural errors just as Jane and David's are, with character names being inserted after their place at the top of the text box again or sentences being repeated. The riddles offered by Cyrus' did nothing to enhance the feeling of horror, instead serving only as bizarre roadblocks to progress through the game.Even with a friend to laugh your way through with, this is not worth the $5.93 (on sale) price tag."

Neither of us knew anything about the game beforehand, other than it having co-op functionality.We have not played far, but we just completed the first area or ""objective"", and we were both surprised! The atmosphere in the game is great, and the feeling of walking into a flat literally felt like walking into a lion's territory! It felt as if we were part of a movie, because we were two trying to carefully investigate the place, struggling to communicate properly due to fear, and even running out in sheer panic at times. Imagine the hilarious, yet horrifying sight of seeing your partner run down the stairs, right past you and back out the entrance door!As mentioned, I have not yet tried the singleplayer portion of the game, but if you want to explore creepy and at times startling areas in a dark town, then definitely try this experience. It is totally worth it, even if just to see how you and your partner can handle horrifying creatures in an immersive setting.One of the things I noticed about this game was that sound effects were a bit confusing, like the player's steps, because it kept sounding like they were coming from elsewhere. I am not sure if that was intentional or not.If you want to see what the multiplayer mode of Stay Close looks like, then here is my friend and me playing:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unrvdLVkfPw"

You either turn your flashlight on to blind the one monster or turn it off so as not to attract the attention of the other monster. You quickly learn when and where to turn your flashlight off and on and just walk forward. The fear goes away within minutes since you'll realize there's only 2 enemies and you're in total control with no surprises..No voice acting or much of any sounds really. Click flashlight on, click flashlight off, monster grunts.Graphics are horrendous, especially the shadows. Gameplay is in dark with a flashlight, light beam seem painted on wherever you're pointed.

The chapter number one has only 2 monsters and about 4 objectives to complete. In this phase of the game ,as it is a new game, there isn't a lot of content to point out, but i'm sure it will be better in the future.Pros-Multiplayer Coop (2 MAX)-Graphics not so good, but not so bad-The dark and shadows of the game gives it a good atmosphereCons-Bugs in AI of the monsters and graphics in general (normally with lightining)-Bad graphical performance (still in low settings)ConclusionThis game, for an new game, is actually pretty well made, the problems are normally related to graphical and AI, which can be resolved in a short period of time. I hope that the developers fix all this problems and add more features to the next chapter, as new monsters, mecanics, and pickable items (like different flashlights, or keys). The price of the game for it's gameplay duration isn't very fair, but in the future when the game gets more content, it will be very accessable.I recomend the game if you have someone to play with, cause the SP mode looks kinda boring. You can pretty much finish the game whitin minutes, so don't buy it if you want to spend a lot of your free time in a new game.

The most you get for a story is some guy named Cyrus giving you riddles found off google and a missing couple that they never shed light on. They haven't even put out more than one chapter. The monsters were literally just sad copies of the Nurse from Silent Hill at best. As for the visuals of the game, it really felt like they just wanted everything to be shiny. For how long they spent fogging out parts of the map you can't enter and shining up the side walks, they could have been givng the main character hair. The only ammusing part of this is game is just the spray paint head they call David. This guy had a bowl cut spray painted ontop of his head, and blonde stubble. In they end, this game should have waited before release and shouldn't have been put on sale. You can get the same experience you got with this game by downloading Cry of Fear.

But I only played single player and I didnt finish all of the achievements, there is more to explore.It was running very well on my computer, I had every graphic on max. No lagg what so ever and its a good looking game (my opinion)I dont lie if I say I got scared and yelled like my 3 year old daughter atleast 10-15 times, no lies! My wife even came into the room and asking whats going on :)So I highly recommend this game if you like getting scared, its totally worth the money. Its like 1 beer on the pub.Im gonna play it again for sure!"

Then this game is for you.  If not, avoid at all costs.This is what happens when you have a developer that doesn't know what they're doing.  It's not scary.  It's basically disfigured creatures that you either look at or don't for them to attack, even then the polygons are more of the disfigurement than the actual art.  The story is laughable at best, with horrible text written.  If steam offered refunds, this would be my first game in over 100 purchased games that I would want a refund.Pros: It's not Super Meat BoyCons: Everything.-Bad art-Lame story-No volume controls? what?!-No gamma controls...(I get it, it's supposed ot be scary, but you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥-Game Concept.-just everything, literally everything, not one redeemable quality."

Once started up the horror aspect does take over and you are instantly drawn into the story and terrifying details.

The game needs one of those mini tutorials at the start of the story that pretty much shows you your options on what to do. The game needs more options and more AI interaction. The walking is way too slow and the running runs out too quickly. This game has way too good of potential, but, just hasn't embraced any of it yet."

76561198084460345,Not Recommended,455120,31560028,Posted: 5 May,all,Davide,"The trailer of this game is just a big joke, putted there by some evil trolls.I've bought this on the product launch, when it was still on sale, certain that the game was good, but unfortunately i've played it only some months later, and jesus what a shame for me to be such a fool...I couldn't even ask for the refund.If you want to find out on your own, just watch the trailer, and then play the game or better just watch some gameplay on youtube, at least  you can avoid the shame to be called a fool like me.But...how does this game is made?Well, i've played only half an hour of this masterpiece of silliness, only on singleplayer, but i think it is enough to give a judgment.This game has been developed using the new Unreal Engine 4, so the main menu use a standard UE 4 prefab, something that you can find in many indi-games made with UE4 here on steam, and as usual windows and text overlap, and at low resolutions the screen and some words get cut off, obviously, and also (this is the funny part) if you change to low resolutions, text-boxs for mouse dectection are not aligned with the text, they are translated in an unknown position, at the right or the left of the text. But this is not a huge problem, right, i mean, if the game is good who the ♥♥♥♥ cares about the main menu, even if...this doesn't look promising.So, i've started the singleplayer and i have been immediately spawned in a corner outside of ""my"" house, sorrounded by dead bodies closed inside some body bags, and two character legs with one animation for all the movement directions.That's it, no explanation, no introduction , no cutscene just you in that corner, and a useless letter hunged on the wall.  I think that first impression should count, and this game is working hard to give me a bad impression.Let's talk about the letter, the first element of interaction in this game, how has this lettere been realized? Well, It has the texture wrongly attached, also if you interact with it, you can glaringly ascertain that the texture and the writing text that appear after the interaction are two completely different things.They could have simply scanned a paper and used it has a texture, but nope, they have decided to take some old missive image from the internet and applay it on the mesh has a texture, and also it seams that they don't even know how to applay correctly a texture on a simple plane, and this is the first thing that the player have to interact, but i'm not here for a letter right if the game is good who the ♥♥♥♥ cares about a letter, right.So, i've started looking around for the city, looking at some old veichles and other game assets stuff, i've found some in the UE Marketplace site (if i recall correctly), and some cost more than two dollars, 50 dollars or 60 dollars for a set of veichles and from 20 to 100 dollars for a single map. At least they have throwed away some money for this ""Thing"", this explain why the price is of 9 dollar for something so poor impressive (EDIT: Someone will prefer to say incomplete).After some searching i've found this guy, called ""Cyrus"", standing in the middle of an antique store. Essentialy a static character with one idle animation, that stands there like a empty shell watching at nothing. So if the letter, as an interactive element, was not impressive, Cyrus is also worse.You can interact with this inanimate character called Cyrus and talk with him, obviously, there aren't audio tracks recorded, some text will appear with some lines of dialogue.What do you expect from Cyrus, he doesn't even know to be in this game.Let's talk about the text in the dialog box, do you remember that problem with the screen resolution and the words that are cutted off...yah, i've to change screen resolution every time i talk with Cyrus, because words are cutted off. My impressions are drastically getting worse.But wait, we are not done with Cyrus, because Cyrus is not only a lifless body, but he has also the dumbest line of dialogue you 've ever heard. And he loves riddles. To gain the trust of this nut, you need to answer some stupid riddles (that he has found on google), by typing the answers in a prompt. After that he will give you a quest, an important quest, you need to find his toy (a compass) that he left in the house infested by monsters (stolen by the pretty bird he said), and you obviously agree without any objection, ""OK, no problem, i will bring you back your toy"", but hey you know what......who the ♥♥♥♥ cares about Cyrus, right, we are here for the monsters, not for talking to a crazy guy.Oh, the monsters, one type reacts to the light the other instead reacts with the shadow. Let's add something i've forgot to say, this game with the light turned off is black, black like my monitor if i turn it off.And this monsters, where they go, they stay, blocking the passage to the player, sometimes is better to restart the game instead of wasting time with them.(EDIT: i've read that if you put yourself at some distance between you and the mosters they should retreat, and returning to their initial position. Obviously this wasn't possible in a narrow place as the house, at least not for me when i got stuck between two monsters.)Also the singleplayer version of this game is unpleyable (EDIT: inconsistent), you need necessarily someone else to help you cover your back in the house, or you will get mad.So i've shuted down the game after my second encounter with Cyrus, and watched the rest of this game on youtube...and i've lost nothing, Cyrus is there just for asking stupid riddles and assigning useless quests, also i've found a certain similarity with the story of another horror game, here on steam called ""Rothschild: The Sheep Will Wake"", both horrible games.it doesn't worth 9 dollars.Oh, also it is 30 minutes long if you know how to play it, and you don't waste game time playing Cyrus stupid riddles.OTHER NEGATIVE and SOME POSITIVE ASPECTS:- with the light turned on everything, also organic things, are very shining. This can hurts someone eyes.- Environment seams impressive but some elements in the map don't feat with the purpose of the game, and also too many things seam all condensed in a very restricted area."

This game could've been something great if they had an actual storyline to it and actual puzzles and not lazy riddles. I do consider the monsters in the game a puzzle but it doesn't change up at all, its always with turning on and off the stupid flashlight. If I wanted something like that I'd play a free SCP game or something. I gave this game a chance because it was somewhat an open world with no loading instances and the first encounters with the monsters were what made me continue with the game. As well as investigating what was going on but all we had for that was a poorly written character named Cyrus and notes left around the map. The notes themselves were hard to find because I was more focused on trying to not get killed by weeping angel rejects. All and all it was just a jump scare maze and I do admit it was challenging and there were a lot of retries. But in the end there was no sense of victory, only disappointment and confusion. I'm sure there were more notes lying around that explained the whole game but using notes to explain it is just lazy. I WOULD RATHER LOOK FOR A FLASH GAME TO DOWNLOAD FOR FREE, or play gmod...Also it looks ugly as hell, wanna play as a male protagonist with his hair spray painted on? Or a female protagonist with picnic shoes?"
