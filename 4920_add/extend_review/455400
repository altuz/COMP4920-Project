,Recommended,455400,23688202,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,AA,"PAC-MAN 256 Is a port of a free to play mobile game developed by Hipster Whale, the talented studio behind the very addictive Crossy Road.This particular PAC-MAN title is based around the infamous level 256 glitch in the 1980’s classic, PAC-MAN. The glitch occurred when the player makes it to level 256, where the right-hand side of the screen would turn in to a jumble of letters and numbers.This is a very unique take on the PAC-MAN formula where you will be challenged to continuously move upwards in a never ending battle with the maze, ghosts, power-ups and the infamous level 256 glitch that is following behind.The aim of the game, like most PAC-MAN and arcade titles is to chase the highest score possible. There are many ways to increase the score multiplier as such as eating many ghosts in quick succession, as you would expect from a PAC-MAN title. The core mechanics that you would expect from a PAC-MAN game are here and they work well, controlling PAC-MAN feels as tight and responsive as ever.Hipster Whale evolve some of the original core PAC-MAN gameplay elements; collecting 256 pac-dots in a row will erupt 256 pac-dot chain that explodes the screen in celebration all while eliminating all ghosts on the screen. I found myself obsessively attempting to earn the 256 pac-dot chain as it was both satisfying and rewarding.Each ghost has their own idiosyncrasies where for example, the pink ghost will chase PAC-MAN if you appear in its line of sight, the orange ghost will continuously move down the screen while the blue ghost will always hug a maze wall and move in a counter-clockwise rotation. Learning how each ghost works is imperative to your success in PAC-MAN 256.Unlike previous titles in the series, PAC-MAN 256 features an array of power-ups that add new elements of fun, tactics and hilarity as you see a large PAC-MAN stomping around the maze squishing ghosts like a out of control bulldozer.Power-ups can be that can be upgraded using coins that are earned within the game and not purchased with real money, unlike the mobile counterpart. Upgrading a power-up will make it more powerful; for example, leveling up the Laser power-up will allow the laser to last longer, giving PAC-MAN more protection from those ever pesky ghosts. As well as earning them in game, you will be rewarded with free coin gifts at random intervals after several runs through the game. This makes this version of the game far more generous with the coins than the original mobile game.On top of the generousness of the in-game currency; upgrade times have been significantly reduced from the mobile game. Within PAC-MAN 256 on mobile devices, it would take anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours to upgrade the power ups. In the PC version of the game, these updates happen instantaneously.The audio should be commended as it sticks to the classic and iconic PAC-MAN sounds and music that PAC-MAN fans have come to love over the years. It does not feel outdated and in fact feels right at home in this zany take on the franchise.A local multiplayer mode is also featured in the game where up to 4 players can share the same screen in a frenzy to earn the highest score. Unfortunately, no online multiplayer is available.As expected, there is not much in the way of graphics options however the game can be played in both windowed and fullscreen with a range of different screen resolutions available to chose from. In-game effects can also be turned on or off.A option to change the skin of each maze is available and this provided me with many extra hours of enjoyment as I waka-waka’d my way through a office, garden, classic 80’s PAC-MAN and even Crossy Road.At £3.99, this game includes no micro-transactions, no advertisements and comes with all add-ons that were available for purchase in the games mobile version.  If you have any interest in PAC-MAN or are just looking for a quick and fun time killer, I would need to recommend you check out PAC-MAN 256 and its unique take on the classic yellow  icon.Head over to PCGN for the full review:https://pcgnet.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/pac-man-256-review/"
,Recommended,455400,23707247,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,Pinballwiz45b,"Pac-Man 256 is inspired by the Level 256 Glitch that appears in the original Pac-Man game. When one reaches level 256, the right half of the maze bugs out as a result of the game trying to spawn 256 ""fruit"" in the bottom right corner. Regardless of the level being impossible to complete, the maze is traversable.In Pac-Man 256, not only will you be doing the same thing on Pac-Man, but you must escape from the Glitch at the bottom of the screen that's trying to kill you as well, all the while trying to get a good score. Each of the ghosts has its own pattern, so you'll need to memorize which ghost does what in any given situation. There are also additional features, such as a Pac-Dot chain, Ghost Chains greater than 4 ghosts, powerups that help kill off ghosts, and a leaderboard that records your top scores.Pac-Man 256 can be brutal at times, but the replay value is worth the price. And this is unlike the mobile version of the game: Credits are removed, no advertisements, and no upgrade wait times are big perks when compared to the mobile version. If you're still unsure, give it a try on mobile if you can."
,Recommended,455400,25521723,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Misery,"First a quick disclaimer:  Steam shows me as only having a short time on this game, but I've been playing the mobile version since it released (which is nearly identical to this one) and have racked up some really huge amount of time on it, so I'm going into this review having already played this game to death.Now, onto the review.Pac-Man 256 is a unique take on the old Pac-Man formula that changes things up quite alot, yet doesnt stray from the ""core"" of the Pac-Man gameplay formula.   You could almost describe this game as Pac-Man + a Roguelike, as the maze is randomly generated out of a large variety of pre-made sections as you go along, with powerups and ghosts placed in random spots.   The idea of the game is simple: You go through the maze as always, eating as many dots as you can, avoiding ghosts, and so on, but in this game the infamous Killscreen Glitch is constantly chasing you.  A solid wall of total gibberish, this is always below your position, and it constantly advances, so you are forced to keep heading upwards further into the maze.  There isnt anything you can do to stop the Glitch, so one way or another, it forces you to keep up a good pace; it's a mechanic that works out pretty well.   It's also honestly just cool to see, they made it look particularly awesome, and the closer you get to it, the more messed up the screen and sound will get, and you get a rather disturbing sound effect if it manages to get you.  So the only thing you can do is to keep moving... right into the clutches of the ever-familiar Ghosts.All the usual cast is here, but there are some unfamiliar faces here too.  Each Ghost has their own unique behavior pattern:  Blinky (red) is the most determined and persistent of all of them (like he was in the original, and will simply chase you non-stop.  Pinky (pink, of course) just sits there until you cross her line of sight, at which point she'll charge at you, moving much faster than you can until she hits a wall.  Inky (blue) simply travels counter-clockwise around whatever maze wall he's currently attached to.  Clyde (orange) never, ever moves upward, but always downward towards the glitch and will take downward paths even if you're right in front of him and it means that he misses you.  Sue (purple) appears in groups, forming a slow moving wall that simply tries to block your path.  Funky (green) forms a longer, fast-moving wall that bounces back and forth.  Spunky (gray) is the lazy one, sleeping until you get near, at which point he goes all Blinky on you for a few seconds before going ""feh"" and falling asleep again.  Lastly, Glitchy (???) is a corrupted mess of a ghost, spraying out wonky letters and symbols as he moves around, also having the ability to teleport.Learning the behaviors of all of these ghosts is the key to mastering the game.  The game will throw TONS of ghosts at you, but it is never unfair about this... there's always a way to dodge them, particularly if you learn how to manipulate certain ones into moving where you want them to.As always, you have the classic Power Pellets at your disposal, which do just what you'd think they do:  They turn the ghosts blue and slow them down, and you can eat them until the effect wears off.  Each ghost you eat in a chain will give more points than the last, and grabbing another Power Pellet while the first is still going will reset it's timer without resetting the chain, allowing for really big points.   Fruits are also plentiful, and when you grab them you get some points and also a multiplier that lasts for awhile, multiplying all incoming points from any source.  Which fruit you grab determines how big the multiplier is (with melons being the highest, at a x6 multiplier), and these are the key to REALLY big scores.  Grabbing a fruit and then getting a high level ghost chain from a Pellet is the thing you most want to do.Of course, with so many ghosts around and the ever advancing Killscreen Glitch, Power Pellets alone arent going to be enough.  Fortunately, the game adds tons of different powerups to the mix.  The great thing about these is that they give you all sorts of fun effects, but they dont go totally overboard.  They never take away from the feel of a real Pac-Man game.  If you've ever played any of the remakes of classic games that were popular in the late 90s, you probably know what I mean by remakes that go too far with new ideas, transforming an old classic into something kinda crappy.  That never happens here, and these powerups only add to the game.  There's all sorts of effects here... you have a laser that fires out in front of Pac-Man (with infinite range until it hits a wall), one item that spawns tornadoes that roam around hunting ghosts, another that puts out an aura around you, causing you to be able to grab dots and things in lanes you arent even in, or other loopy effects.  You have a ""loadout"" of three powerups that you can choose before beginning a run, which determines which powerups will appear in that run.  Power Pellets will always appear, and are the ones with the biggest scoring potential by far.  Learning to use all of these different items is very important, and not all of them are easy to use to their fullest potential.Unlocking powerups and enhancing them is a pretty slow process... the unlocking simply happens as you keep playing, but powering them up further requires coins, which are either found in the maze or given to you by the various ""missions"" that will pop up.  Each time you enhance a powerup, it will either last a bit longer, or give more points, and each time the cost for the next enhancement will double.  These get very expensive after awhile and the process gets slower and slower, so that can be a bit of an issue at times.There is one other special mechanic:  As you keep eating dots, you'll notice that there's a counter that keeps going up as you keep eating them.  At certain intervals (16, 32, 64, so on) you'll get a small blob of points, but the real bonus happens if you can get your dot chain up to 256, which will give you a huge point bonus and clear the screen and next maze section of ghosts.  Doing this is difficult though; if your chain is interrupted by running over an empty space, it resets back to 0.  Getting a full chain of 256 is the most difficult thing to do in the game.One other thing to keep in mind is that this is a port of a mobile game, and a bit of a lazy one at that.  It does have it's issues, but fortunately not many... I found that they dont really impact my experience with the game much.Also:  This is a DIFFICULT game.  You're going to die.  Really often, and often really fast.  The game gets brutal quickly.  The ghost combinations and maze layouts work together to make your task as complicated and challenging as possible, and once you get hit, that's it, that's the end of your run.  Getting a truly high score is no small feat.Overall, this is a fantastic game, and expands really well on the old Pac-man formula without screwing anything up.  For me, this is one of those games that I just keep coming back to constantly, and I can absolutely recommend it to anyone that likes Pac-man whatsoever."

The goal is simple: You are pacman, stuck into a randomly generated infinite maze, and have to make your way through the ghosts as far as you can while escaping from the glitches.Difference from the Mobile Version:-No Microtransactions (including NO WAITING! between upgrades)-Skins are free-Local Multiplayer-Resolutions choice-1 life instead of 2 (they probably decided to give 2 lives on mobile since the unlimited play DLC is $7.99 and this port is $5)PROS:-Casual fun-Good replay value-Many powerups to unlock and upgradeCONS:-Combos breaks easier than on Mobile (on Mobile you were able to turn an empty corner and still continue your combo)The only feature I think it would need is a bigger field of view on the maze"

It's basicly identical to the mobile version, which is free but lacks the multiplayer mode. In that version you pay for new types of powerups to unlock faster. Luckily, the steam version doesn't have any form of microtransaction, but it does take a while to get everything unlocked. I clocked in around 18 hours till the last powerup was available for me. After this, I played more just to upgrade the power-ups (which is, for unlocking the achievement, also a lot of play time).The multiplayer being local-only is the main reason why I only spent about 30 minutes total with it playing with another. I don't know if me and my friends will play this game again, considering the simplistic gamedesign that was initially intended for quick burts of action on the phoneon the go. Despite that, the current asking price is 5 bucks which I think is a suitable number for a steam game that you can play while watching (or listening to) something in the background."

That is the game.There is some strategy to the game, which you will pick up over time, assuming you stick around long enough to really absorb.

Like any FTP game for a mobile platform, it was totally playable for free, but in order to do anything quickly or get the best content, you had to deal with in-app purchases.Now we have the console version. It's $4.99 up front, but what that gets you is no gimmicks, no money grabs, and a whole lot of fun. The game isn't quite as exciting as Pac-Man Championship Edition, but it's still a fantastic time trying to rack up as high of a score as possible. Not only that, but now that in-app purchases are gone, powerup upgrades are instant, and coins are far easier to come by, making the grind from the mobile game much easier to deal with and much easier to enjoy.If you're a fan of the classic maze games, I'd definitely give this game a shot.

The design is made with love and the powerups are a great idea.The only thing I dislike is that the replay value is really low. After levelling up most powerups, the game becomes more of an endurance race rather than challenging. That's mostly because it is much too slow and the speed seems to be fit to mobile input. Ghost movements are all perfectly predictable and the only time you run into a death situation if they randomly spawn around you, and you had bad luck.Other than that, it's still fun, though it might not convince players who love speedy and challenging action."

The title, PAC-MAN 256, refers to the 265th level in the original PAC-MAN arcade game, which is famous for glitching out, preventing you from continuing. The game is made by the same guy who made Crossy Road, and it maintains that style. There are multiple unlockable ""themes"" to play in, and a neat upgrade system.So, yes, it's a mobile game port, and yes, the mobile game is free.

Basically, how many people know about the kill screen in Pac-Man? A lot. Basically, when you get to level 256, the game freaks out and half the board is missing. That is how this game was born. It started as an iOS game, then it was ported to Steam, PS4, and maybe XBOX ONE. Since this was made by Hipster Whale, the guys behind the ""Smashy"" series, they took Pac-Man (with permission of course, as this was published by Bandai Namco) and sprinkled their magic to update the game. This version of Pac-Man has more than just the Power Pellets, since here, you have fire, giantness, and even LAZERS!! The game is also no longer a goal to eat all the Pac-Dots, as the game is now an endless run upward. You use said powerups to defeat ghosts as you go up, as like in normal Pac-Man. After all, in Pac-Man, the ghosts always do one thing: ""Pac-Man, WELCOME TO DIE!!!"" The game is super fun this way with the ability to upgrade your powerups for more points and longer lasts. The game also has a lot of fanservice (the good kind with all the references and what not. Not the... other kind) as you can choose many styles from the classic Pac-Man all the way to CE DX+. There is also a style that is based on Hipster Whale's iOS classics. To make it better for the ports Hipster Whale removed all microtransactions (as the iOS version probably has them) and added multiplayer. Sadly, there is no online. Just local, and that is my main flaw. My other flaw is that runs can usually end abruptly since ghosts can corner you at bad times and unlike the original Pac-Man, you have no lives. However, in multiplayer, you can be revived. I recommend this game to Pac-Man fans, players of Pac-Man who want a spin on the old formula, and people who want to just have a good hour to spend, as this can get addicting, especially to get the 256 Pac-Dot chain to screen nuke everything. The game is also only 5 bucks, so it's cheap enough so you can use leftover funds for other things. Like food, or something I dunno.

This game is gorgeous.  Don't let the simple appearance fool you, there's a lot going on here!  The various visual themes means the look never has to get stale.  Graphical ""glitches"" come across the map in waves, forcing you forward and altering the game ahead of you.  Powerups are greeted with flashy effects and zooms.The powerups!  There's a ton of them, and each can be leveled up with coins.  Other features new to Pac-Man are loadouts, and some limited stealth mechanics.There's some genuine gameplay innovation going on, as well.  Ghosts are more like Agent Smiths.  The traditional ghost personalities are present, but when glitches hit the map, they might switch, or even disappear.Is it Game of the Year?  Probably not.

In this game, the Missingno-esque wall of glitchiness actively advances towards you from the bottom of the screen, and you have to endlessly make your way upwards while eating as many dots as you can. It's a neat idea, and it works. Along the way there are ghosts to avoid, Power Pellets to even the odds, cherries, strawberries, apples, oranges and melons to eat, and 21 different power-ups that are unlocked as you play.The Power-Ups are mostly pretty cool. There's lasers and fire and icicles and traps and bombs and beams and tornados and they're unlocked in an orderly fashion that keeps the gameplay fresh. You can only choose three Power-Ups at a time to show up in the maze, but whichever one is next to be unlocked will occasionally fly down and give you a brief taste of things to come. The Power-Ups occasionally repeat though, so you'll start the game with Lasers, and later earn Optics, which are exactly the same as Lasers except they fire around corners as well, making them infinitely better. You can unlock a Tornado which chases enemies down, but later you can unlock the Twinado, which is like the Tornado, but there's two of them.You unlock the Power-Ups by eating Pac-Dots, but you upgrade them using coins that you can earn by doing missions, which include things like 'Eat a chain of 128 Dots', 'Eat 4 Apples', 'Eat 5 Power Pellets', 'Eat 20 Ghosts', 'Kill 20 Ghosts with the Fire Power-Up', and so on. They never really go up in difficulty, but the majority revolve around eating or using a certain Power-Up, so it's a nice way to force in some variety. And your progress carries over, so you don't have to eat 20 ghosts in a single run if that's a little too challenging for you.One of the biggest down-sides is that I've heard that this is a port of a mobile game, and I'm willing to bet that it was one of those 'Free to Play - Fee to Pay' mobile games, because grinding for coins to upgrade your Power-Ups is a nightmare. There are coins in the mazes, but they're only worth 2 or 5, which is terrible when you need to earn more than 85,000 to fully upgrade your arsenal. You get boxes of coins for completing missions, and sometimes just as random free gifts, but they contain random values of either 128, 256, 512 and 1,024. As you may expect, it's most commonly 128, with the thousand only showing up very rarely, maybe once after beating 10 missions.That's definitely the biggest problem - the grinding. This is a good game, honestly, but it's not the kind of game I'd want to play for more than 5-6 hours. And it bugs me to know that with every Power-Up unlocked, a decent high score achieved, and all of my favourte Power-Ups fully upgraded, I would still need to spend another 20 or so hours to get the last achievement, because the game wants me to keep playing, but it doesn't know how to make me beyond making the final achievement 'Fully Upgrade Every Power-Up'.But if the greatest crime this game commits is 'Wanting me to keep playing for a very long time', then I can sort-of forgive that. After the disappointment that was Pac-Man Championship Edition 2, this is a wholeheartedly good, if not great, Pac-Man game."

Like empty space being placed up long pathways that you can't see until it's too late, causing your dot combo to get messed up. Or how the powerup needed to get the next free chest suddenly becomes extremely scarce. Not to mention how getting a huge dot combo doesn't amount to much beyond clearing the screen of ghosts when you reach 256, which is immensely hard to do with how the game constantly screws your flow.Understandable since this is a mobile game intended to make you spend money, but I expect a PC game that I paid for one time to be balanced for fun, not profit.Thankfully I only spent a couple bucks on it during a winter sale. I don't quite regret my purchase. I still think the game is fun, but manage your expectations. This is a mobile game through and through."

Very addicting, enjoyable, and easy to sink hours on end, just trying to beat your own high score, or earn a new power-up.

Definitely makes it more fun.  The glitchy numbers mass which I call ""the matrix"" that works it's way up the maze and makes you have to continually keep on the move is a cool element as well.I gave the game a solid 85% score considering it's $5 USD price tag on Steam here.  It seems to have good value, it is fun, and the controls, while basic WASD or arrow key controls are all you use are very responsive and fluid.Thing's I'd love to see added..- Online multiplayer modes with perhaps the ability to sabatage other online opponents with mines, bombs, blobs of glue to make them slow, etc might be fun.- A Global online high score list in addition to the current ability to see Steam friends high scores.- Boss battles as you progress might be an interesing addition, like touch a glowing boss in the maze to go to a special ""boss battle room"" where you can use your chose power-ups to try and defeat a giant boss.. something like that anyhow.- Anything that fits this game that could add replayability like the boss battle idea above, but maybe also adding options functionality to give players the choice of turning such options off or on would be nice as well.Still, for $5 you can't go too wrong.. especially if you enjoy Pac-Man games or the classics.

Here is an endless maze based on the level 256 glitch of the original Pac Man and as a result, this doesn't quite feel like Pac MAn.  Ghosts are no longer entirely predictable and your path being randomly generated makes for a less strategic and more tactical responsive game.  To offset this change in the nature of the game, you'll have access to and will unlock powerups that will let you mow down ghosts or simply flatten them as you race towards the top of the screen.As such, this is sort of like a roguelike Pac Man, though I apply the term loosely.  Unlike CE, 256 favors a slow, methodical pace over insane speeds and path optimization.  You will be forever 'chased' by the oncoming glitch so despite the pace, you still have to keep moving ever forward.  I suppose there's a philosophical metaphor there, but you can figure that one out on your own.Still, 256 is a good time-waster and is geared for those who like endless endeavours to score higher, go further, and unlock more stuff.  Presentation is fantastic with a whole slew of different Pac Man themes to be applied to the mazes, all the right sounds are in place, and it's as colorful as CE, if not necessarily as adrenaline-inducing.If you have no modern Pac Man game, I would recommend you go and pick up the original CE DX+.  However, if you've got 'em all and you've seen them through all of their courses, then 256 is a valiant effort by Namco to revitalize the game and is worth your time if you're just itching for another Pac Man jaunt."

I see a lot of people say that it's not worth playing solo but I still have a lot of fun playing by myself and I hate most games. This game rewards strategy and skill to keep your pac-man alive. You can't just blindly move forward without considering what will be coming ahead of you. You need to treat each ghost in a different way, some you will have to bait and some you have to simply avoid.The game gets easier as you upgrade your skills and the later skills (my favorites are the lightning and the last green laser beam) but there's no end to the game so that just means you will be surviving longer and getting better scores. I sometimes disable the better skills just to give the game more challenge. There's some ""quest"" type mechanics that give you extra coins to upgrade skills but after 10 hours I have all the coins I need.Overall one of my favorite party games. Simple but fun."

It's easy to learn, hard to master and even harder to walk away from.dont just collect the power pelets collect power ups and traps.There are 2 types of power up attacking and stealth. you can eat a power pellet to eat the ghosts or become giant and squash them of even zap them with lazers.there is a stealth power up that makes ghosts invisible and you can pass through them.But what fun are these power ups unless you can upgrade them to make them last sooo much longer.Another cool point is you can change your maze and charecters from the classic style pac-man, to  my personal favriot pac mania as i loved this game on the master system, all the wayto the neon glow of the championship edition even that hit indie kids game crossy roads yes thats right your a chicken and you have to avoid ghosts dressed as cars.Where this game really shines is is local co op where up to 4 players can sit round and join in the mayhemeither 2 players on a key bord and 2 controllers or grab 4 controllers and slouch on the couch and  chase the numbered dragon together.In short Pac-man 256 is a port of one of them endless runner type of games on your mobile phones that  don't suck.I would recomend this to seasoned pac-maners who look for another way to get there fix  or who is new to pac-man."

There is no Game settings menu for extra replay options such as game speed, ghost options, and the like. Multiplayer is local only, leaderboards are tied specifically to your Steam friend list.

Its addictive, its fun, but its free on phones, and vastly inferior to Pac Man Championship Edition DX.PAC-MAN 256 is a Pacman interpretation of Crossy Roads.  Pacman must navigate an RNG maze with ghosts with new behaviors exclusive to 256 (Pinky is still the biggest threat though.)  Behind Pacman is a wall of 8-bit glitchy cacophony that swallows everything up.  You rack up points primarily from dot combos, which max out at 256, hence the name.  Furthermore, an assortment of powerups is gradually collected for your arsenal, which replace traditional power pellets and which  you can optionally equip.The pace is frantic and fun like Crossy Roads, but I hope you don't care about score, because 256 is basically at the mercy of RNG.  Occasionally very tight dual lanes will generate with no escape.  Your dot combos are occasionally broken by areas where the dots simply stop for no reason.  The worst offender of them all is the camera.  THE CAMERA!  IN A PAC MAN GAME!  The camera is centered around PAC man no matter what, limiting your view of whats ahead, and what awaits you when you use the side warps to stay alive.Children will like this, I know I do, but they could get it free on their phone, and for a more finely tuned experience, CE DX is the superior alternative."

,Recommended,455400,30566162,Posted: 17 March,all,Lostn Sound,"Pac-Man 256 - The endless chomp questOverviewTake the classic formula of Pac-Man chowing down on those little white dots and power pellets and turn it into an endless runner. Inspired by the infamous level 256 where due to memory limitations half of the level would glitch out this game has the bottom portion of the screen constantly being eaten up by a glitch forcing you to run away and continue upwards.GameplayThis game retains the awesome mechanics of the original... Eat, eat, eat and run from ghosts. The original ghosts are all back as well as the addition of a new ghost glitchy. This port from the original does have some changes. They have removed all the microtransactions which is a welcome feature and have added the option to play multiplayer! Co-op play in this is a blast. It gets very tense and if you die your team mate will have the opportunity to revive you. You can work together to unlock new power ups and continue to improve your score.GraphicsThe graphics are off the hook! you have never seen such cutting edge pixels in your life! it will make your eyes bleed! In all seriousness this is a great presentation. It keeps the feel of the old while updating it and making it feel like something fresh and new. There are several different themes that you can choose from including the developers previous title crossy road.ConclusionAll together I think one of the freshest takes on Pac-Man in recent years, and possibly even since its inception. A lot of fun to play in short bursts and true to its source material. I definitely recommend to people looking for a challenge or something as a quick burst of fun that you will keep coming back to.5 Pacs out of 5!!!"

Would at least be nice to have an option or it as another game mode.It would be nice to have a *full zoom out* that covers everything(i.e. the left and right sides of the field are always viable so you can see if a ghost is coming via the ""tunnel"").While it isn't the worst, some of the carryover stuff from the mobile F2P version is kind of meh.In addition to earning power-up upgrade coins via ""missions"" and in the maze, you also randomly get gift coins, but there isn't much else to do with such after you upgrade them.Unlocking new power ups is a bit of a grind too, and there isn't anything new added to the PC port."

It is very easy to argue that there isn't enough ""game"" to warrant its regular $5 price tag.  I don't recommend it unless it is on sale.Fatal flaws:Pac-Man 256 quickly becomes a game of luck rather than skill. The limited forward view combined with the design of the maze means that often you have to blindly commit to a path, with danger only being revealed after it is too late to escape.   Sometimes there appears to be no safe path at all, where nothing short of an active power-up could have saved you.  As your score increases, the number of ghosts increase.  In single player, around the 10,000 point mark you will be entirely reliant on your current power up lasting long enough to safely reach the next power up.  (In multi-player, things are a bit different due to some power-ups being replaced with ""revive a fallen player"" items.)Power-ups themselves leave a bit to be desired.  At first, it looks like there are a large number of power-ups, but some are just ""better"" versions of others.  The different power up designs also vary in effectiveness, a critical flaw when the game has you choosing three power-ups to appear.  Freeze is at best nearly useless, and is too often an outright liability. (Slows ghosts, but the main danger of ghosts is when they are in front of you, not chasing from behind.)  Cloak makes you invulnerable, but other abilities make you both invulnerable and fatal to ghosts.  Abilities like Tornado and Pac-Men are unreliable, sometimes they are highly effective while other times they leave you open to danger.The grind is far greater than the game's limited content.  You will unlock new power-ups quickly at first, but this rate soon slows to a crawl.There just isn't much to do.  The basic game doesn't change.  There are no alternate modes of play.  There isn't any real test of skill, as no measure of skill will counter the random death factor."
,Recommended,455400,30285444,Posted: 2 March,all,c5,"A fantastic spin on the classic that stays true to classic Pac-Man while being supremely addictive. Basically it's an infinite Pac-Man maze where you have to survive as long as possible, and you get bonus points if you manage to eat 256 consecutive dots. To keep things fresh, you basically play to unlock further power-ups which make you more and more powerful. It's a good progression that makes you really want to play one more game to get the next powerup, but doesn't feel like a grind. Each round gives a great sense of progress and I topped out the final power-up after about 10 hours of play, which felt like good value and even now I find myself still playing just to top my old scores. Pac-Man 256 isn't quite as flashy or over-the-top as the also-excellent Championship games, but I feel like there's more room for strategizing with how you can pick what powerups you want, and there's a great sense of split-second decision making: Do I go for the powerup or try to keep the dot chain going? Can I keep this going, or should I escape the ghosts? Stuff like that makes the game fun and exciting and it feels like no two rounds are ever quite the same. Great game!"

,Recommended,455400,29177708,Posted: 10 January,all,Therac-25,"Absolutely excellent and addictive score rush Pac-Man.  The controls are superb, the various map styles are (mostly) all excellent, and the sounds and power-up feedback are all pitch perfect.If you enjoy Pac-Man gameplay, this is an excellent experience.  It takes a couple of hours of gameplay to get all the power-ups unlocked, quite a bit more to power them all up fully, but once you get them all unlocked and get the most powerful ones levelled up to 8, you can compete in the leaderboards with no issues other than your own skill and patience.Probably thebestthing about this game, which I love the most, is that it doesn't artifically ramp up the difficulty as it progresses.  The difficulty is constant, so getting a high score is largely about mastering the gameplay, being careful and simply not screwing up.   Once you do that, you can go on for what feels like forever.This is one of the best examples ever of apure game.  There's no attempt to rationalize or explain it, it's just an endless score rush Pac-Man."

I never really liked crossy roads, but Pac Man 256 I do.The board isn't a normal Pac Man board, you have to move up the board, it then scrolls down as you move up, if you don't then you'll eventually be swallowed up by a bunch of numbers and letters, the numbers and letters are like that for a reason.In the original Pac man if you reached the 256th board you'd have encountered the famous 256 bug,  Players who reached the 256th board in the original Arcade Pac Man caused a buffer overflow, causinng the data in other areas to be overwritten, and thus you couldn't finish it.There's various power-ups in Pac Man 256, you can choose 3 at the start of game, others will unlock over time.

Your goal is to flee from an unstoppable glitch wall, but the maze of dots has ghosts, fruit and powerups littered around to keep things interesting. Powerups allow you to customise your playstyle slightly (some are great for clearing ghosts, and others like stealth are useful for making distance quickly since you can essentially ignore the ghosts altogether for the duration). You only have three slots but there are a ton to choose from, and after hitting total-dots-eaten milestones more will become available. It'll take a while to get everything opened up. Thankfully there are no microtransactions or ads to sit through to unlock anything, just play and they'll roll in. I love how each colour of ghost has their own behaviour, and will react reliably. There's very little down to chance, so with enough practice you can reliably get big scores. If you like Pac Man it's easy to spend a lot of time trying to beat your personal best."
