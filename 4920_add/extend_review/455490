It's funny but lacks contents.There are 3 different endings, each time the game will take you about 10 minutes to finish. I was trying to take different paths, but they made little to no difference in the end.Gameplay is basic visual novel, where you read a part, answer some questions which defined how the story continues.Even for visual novel, this is way too short. One playthought takes about 10 minutes, when you read everything. So you could beat it 100% in less than an hour.With more content, if it was lenghtier I could recommend it. But the way it is, I can't recommend paying to play it."

As Master Indigo has pointed out, it takes approximately 10 minutes to complete one story arch and there is only three of them. The game also gives you a false promise of gaining skills like strenght, intelligence and charisma, but in the end there is not enough complexity for that kind of thing. They only affect which ending you get and there isn't really enough time that to be anywhere important factor. You gained some strenght, what of it? Where do I use it? What is the meaning of having a good strenght and low intelligence? Does my choices matter? It's over already?I love dating sims where you gain attributes by doing deliberate choices and put effort in raising them. I also love visual novels, where there is a good and long enough story that I feel immersed in the world and the few choices I make really makes me think or regret things. This is not one of them. I feel I paid too much and it was only 2,99€. On the hindsight, I wouldn't play it even for free. It is not badly made game, but it is too short and makes the player too passive as a watcher. Either add more meaning to the choices or make it much longer."

I personally found it very amusing.Playing as a new college student (fill in the name) his main concern is not ending up a virgin (though the game says dateless) before his 30th birthday.  If he is a virgin at age 30, he will become a Level 30 wizard which is the last thing he wants to happen.  He is basically a NEET already and trying to emerge from his shell.  The amusing bits are the fact he is not apologetic about his mind set and simply happy any woman talks to him.  He is not creepy or really perverted in his attempts at talking to women just a little clueless, rather awkward and a bit stupid if that choice is made.  His internal dialogue is really amusing, at least to me it was.This is a short game, about an hour if the player uses the save game feature.  Ultimately, there are three woman he can try to date and win the heart of, two in college, and one later at his professional work place.  For older players say anyone over 30 (who has ever dated or tried to date), there are some quite tongue in cheek and rather hidden inferences about the realities and hazards of dating.  (Which will get into spoiler territory if revealed and is probably why I found this game so interesting.)  My last achievement was Archmage (get rejected by girls so much your magic is limitless) and I found that rather hard to get. (The player has to work hard at failing in this game.)  All three women are very easily romanced (There can be only one - per game scenerio) if the player uses just a little strategy when investing points into Charisma, Intelligence, or Strength.All in all, an interesting and amusing game, and worth an hour or so of time."

,Recommended,455490,21990129,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,Mantis (Card Farming),"""Don't Die Dateless, Dummy!"" is a pretty fun game that is worth buying, but only as filler entertainment to enjoy during a boring evening. You've probably noticed that most of the reviews have a short gameplay time. That's because you can easily beat the game in half an hour. That is, one route. (Maybe more, I was alt-tabbing a bit so it could probably be beaten in less time.) I barely got to know a girl and talked to her on only a couple of occasions, then ""Game Over"", I live happily ever after with her.For such a short experience, how could I recommend the game? First of all, it's very cheap (I imagine even more so during sales), and secondly it's hilarious. The script is awful but it has a ""so bad it's good"" charm, with lots of internet culture references. If you choose your paths carefully you'll get with a girl fairly quickly, but be sure to save often as wrong choices lead to bad endings, in which you don't lose your virginity before the age of thirty, becoming a wizard. (Again, these are usually hilarious.)There's not really much else to say. One gripe is the UI, or lack thereof. Hey, game developer, are you nuts? The background text box is just a semi-transparent rectangle, and here's the stupid part. When there is a paragraph of text, the text box takes up about 1/3 of the screen. Now at times, a single line of text can appear with the text box taking up 90% of the vertical space. It's madness! I haven't come across a single time that the text takes up more than 50% of the box size. This is a minor gripe and probably something the developer could fix easily.Bottom line: Do you want a game that's funny, cheap and you don't mind if you don't get more than an evening out of it? If yes, buy. If no, there are other cheap indie games that last much longer. Isn't that bird dating sim pretty cheap? Take your pick, wizard."

There's plenty of better visual novels, but this is average."

There is no way to determine which choice is right because the ""right"" choice is whatever the developer wants it to be instead of what makes sense. You can play through and get a bad ending, then play through again with the opposite choices and still get a bad ending.   If you enjoy making random choices until you stumble on the right combination to get a good ending then this might be for you.  It's probably better to forget about this and go talk to some real girls in real life."

Why did I get it then, you ask? My friends and I got it after a night out at the bar as a joke, having heard of the ""level thirty wizard"" ending, and assumed it would be funny in a live-action Super Mario kind of way: hilarious cheesy trash that would at least be enjoyable inebriated. Spoiler: it isn't. This is one of those games that crosses the line thrice: from bad to so bad it's good to so bad it's horrible. We got a bad ending by picking one arbirtray choice, then ten minutes later bumbled our way into the Ellie ending through equally arbitrary choices. It's badly written, badly concieved, badly designed and badly pretty much everything when you get right down it. Written by a misogynistic frat boy who has not gotten to first base with a woman other than his mother and programmed by an infinite army of monkeys with typewriters that haven't gotten around to writing Hamlet yet, I cannot un-recommend this game enough.

This game is kinda expensive for what it is. However, I'd say that if you buy this game, it's worth keeping. The humor in this game is really good at what it tries to do, especially one scene in particular that I found to be pretty clever. Which scene that is and why it's clever is not something I'm gonna explain here, though, because that's not what this is about. It took me 45 minutes to get all 3 good endings and some of the ""Wizard"" endings, too, but I'd still say it's worth a buy. It's one of those super short Visual Novels that you may want to pick up and play every once in a while.

No idea what those other reviewers were talking about, saying it was hard to get the endings, but for a game with two(?) main routes, skipping text is needed. I kept clicking the space bar and selecting the wrong choices for the other playthroughs, and had to restart.Only got 2/4 achievements, and I think that there might be a third girl to get, judging from both achievements and the title screen, but I don't really want to go back right now and try to get it. There wasn't any nudity in this game at all, which was the top reason I bought it, besides the price being cheap. It was just one ending scene where it shows the girl in their bra. Their expressions not really changing was also an issue I didn't like.Other than that though, I liked the writing style. As a fellow Ren'py user, I'd say this is a good reference for how dialogue should flow, and the kind of tone background music should have. Because from personal experience, a lot of free music resources out there are either too loud, or sped up. Which doesn't really work since a lot of VN's on steam are high school/college type of settings. Can't really say much about the story, knowing that it was a short game.The protagonist's thoughts were pretty cringey, which I wouldn't say is a bad thing. Talking to the two girls, the game gets into the trope where characters tell their backstories to strangers they've only just met, although I don't think it felt forced. Stats are the only choices that really matter, since the dialogue options just lead to the same ones no matter what. That's pretty much all you can really say about the game."
