I still have my copy.Pros:This is the game I love, on PC.I'm a step closer to being able to get rid of my N64 and its box of accessories.Having the game always available in Steam is pretty cool.I got it cheap on sale.You can still Google all the cheat codes, to unlock the game and get on with the nostalgia.Cons:BUT, this is not an enchanced, or redone or anything. It's just a step above running the game on an emulator.It doesn't have the resolutions you want (although there are tools like nGlide you can install to force it into other resolutions).It also took me awhile to get the keyboard+mouse controls right, but it had the options to do it. Maybe controller would be easier.Most troubling, there is a glitch that will set the camera WAY too far out, making the game unplayable, and it happens frequently. The fix it to push F1 (which zooms in the camera) at the start of each level each time. This will make the camera too close for a little bit, but then the camera will behave normally.So I'm still really happy to have this in my collection, but it's not perfect."

It was one of my first ever games on a c.d. rom back in 1998-1999 (17th grade) and playing it now was just as fun, maybe even more,Back than I had and awkward Microsoft Joystick, today I use the XBOX one controller.Using the XBOX one controller the control is very confortalbe (after customizing it using the settings) and I had no problem what so ever to run the game. I had one crash during my 6 or so hours and that's it.Important suggestionThis is for nVidia card owners, but I'm sure there's something similar for AMD cards as wellThe game is from 1998. On modern screen the game is Jaggie as hell and even though you don't buy this game today for it's amazing graphincs, going into the nvidia control panel and changing the 3D settings specifically for this application, forcing Anti-Aliasin, Antistropic filterring and what not improved the visuals immensly. For example, in the mission select screen there are some kind of laser rays, before they basicaly looked like steps and after they looked almost completly smooth. And everything you do, no matter how 'expensive' it is in terms of GPU, it's on a 1998 game so no effect.One very importnt issue for people planning on using the XBOX one controller on windows 10 (and maybe older windows versions). Tht triggers used to be buttons (with on/off state and that's it). now they are an axis (the value corresponds to how much the trigger is pressed). The problem is that older games that aren't aware of this keep receiving the 0 value of the tigger axis when trying to configure the controller in game. The result is that you can't configure the buttons the buttons.I myself have the xBox one elite controller, and the software that comes with it allows me to set the middle point of the axis to a comfortable place (like the end of the axis), then when I configure the buttons I just press the triggers all the way and I can set the buttons - no problem. Did this with Rogue squadron and also Assassin's creed II. If you don't have the software this is harder to do, but I know there are some 3rd party configuration apps that allow to do just that. Another option is to use the XBOX 360 controller, but I don't like it as much. It's triggers however are plain buttons so no problem there.One last comment.I read some revires saying that this game is not configured well for the latest and greatest machines. Now I can't speak on behalf of anyone but me, but my rig is pretty strong (i7 6700k, 16GB DDR4, SSD, gtx 980 TI) and I had no problem at all. Before I had the game on steam I tried using my old c.d. and there were a lot of problems (it was on windows 7, about two years ago) so maybe there was a patch, I don't know. Either way, works great for me,Oh, and, once you're finished, use these, their fun :)http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/70612-star-wars-rogue-squadron-3d/cheats"

Any pros and cons, you ask? I do have a few pros, but absolutely no cons! *thinks a bit* Well, maybe one con. Nothin' to do with the game itself, though!Pros:- Nostalgia! (Only for those who played it on the N64. Hopefully, most of y'all!)- Your ship has unlimited ammo; and your guns don't overheat. (Not that they do in the Star Wars Universe)- The levels are really fun! However, I must warn you, as in the N64 version, the re-release has timed levels as well!- Let's say you want to abort a mission because you want to go to bed, or need to take a break from gaming, and you get a ""Failed""; don't worry, because it WILL NOT count against your profile!-Slightly different way to make your profile than on the N64. Instead of choosing ""Select Game"", you are presented a roster. Instead of three letters (can be one's initials), you can type a full name (example: Dash Rendar, Luke Skywalker, etc.) which I am very pleased! So, yeah, startin' to feel old just sayin' that!Con(s):- Some people make the mistake of getting a game like this, and finding out that they need a joystick or console controller in order to easily play this game; please don't be one of them! The joystick I have, the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, is at least $30. Price of the joystick various, though, on the store you get it from!Before I conclude in rating this game, I must share with you a tip that has served me well!Tip: Always let your compass be your guide!My rating for this game: Solid 5/5!"

Upon firing it up, I was looking forward to the same arcade style space flight sim action that I grew to love nearly 20 years ago - good controls, nice visuals (even if somewhat dated now) and a wonderful difficulty curve in achieving increasingly difficult mission objectives for advanced unlocks.However, I cannot recommend this version of the game until the developers who created this fix a camera problem experienced by many:WHEN ACCELERATING IN THIS VERSION OF THE GAME, YOUR SHIP WILL CONSTANTLY FLY BEYOND THE CAMERA'S VIEW.The only way to rectify this currently is by continuously pressing whatever key you designate to reset your camera view...constantly.It is incredibly disappointing that a wonderful game has been ruined by a sloppy remake that can't bother to have a functioning camera and furthermore a developer that refuses to fix it, banking that nostalgia will continue to sell it despite an increasingly large amount of warnings that it is currently unplayable."

Gameplay-wise this game definitely stands the test of time and is worth the 10 bucks. However, when I first got the game I had a lot of trouble getting it to work so new players should be aware of two things:1) You NEED a controller to play this game. While it'spossibleto play with mouse and keyboard, the extra effort really ruins the experience (for me anyway).2) Unlike the latter two rouge squadron titles, the camera system is much more robust, but this causes more problems than its worth IMO. When I first start a mission the camera stays fixed at the entry point so that as I fly forward, the camera zooms waaaay out making it hard to see my own ship and manuver quickly. Thus, be sure to cycle through camera perspectives at the start of every mission so you get the one you want. The style from the later games should only require one or two presses of the camera button."

It's an extremely fast-paced combat flight game! Do not let that sound intimidating, however! It may be fast and frantic, but is not overwhelming! In addition, being the last one flying in one piece is ever so satisfying, with a sense of accomplishment! (A great balance of difficulty, I feel!) Add to that the extremely responsive and easy flying controls! Despite the game's physical age, it is extremely fun to play, to this very day, even for newcomers to the Rogue Squadron series! The game itself is quite short, able to be 100% complete, within a couple of hours, gold medals and all! However, newcomers have much offered to them, I feel!

I figured the price had something to do with making the game compatible, but I was wrong.I see most people are using xbox 360 controllers, and these don't work as smooth as people are saying. They are ok at best. You cannot reconfigure the controller in the options, and the menu tends to fade to black randomly. Changing sensivitity doesn't seem to exist at all.In game, it seems the camera is buggy especially if you boost with the x-wing. It is incredibly frustrating when your vehicle barely turns or makes huge circles depending on the camera angle. One time I even was stuck in the cockpit mode flying into oblivion. It could definitely use some sort of patch. I certainly see why some of the youtube playthroughs have terrible aim. So good luck gold plating the levels to get to hoth.After about 2 hours of trying to get back into it and thinking maybe I just suck at flying (trying to keep an open mind), I realized the controls, camera, and the random crashing made the experience not worth it. Honestly, I had such high hopes to play these levels again. The compatiability effort on the developer's end is just not there. Guess they figured everyone (like me) would purchase out of nostalgia. I just requested a refund as I approached my 2 hour limit.Only neat thing for anyone that wants to keep the game, I typed in the chicken password, and I started level 1 as an at-st...it was sweet, but the aim head stick is the same as the move stick so it was akward.

So I moved away from it, stretching the cords as far as they could go, and then got really frustrated on Fest with those annoying AT-PTs getting blown to shreds.  I instinctively jerked the controller back a bit, and the cords didn't detach, just brough the entire tv crashing to the ground, right onto the N64.  TV was trashed, but after vacuuming out the glass from the vents, the N64 and the game were fine.  I made my roommate do the bulk of the cleaning, since I maintain to this day that the fall was her fault.  Plus, she used to make  fun of me for playing ""boy games"" because she wanted to only play Mario Kart 64. This was a 20 year old woman with major internalized misogyny.  Boy games.

I hope you enjoy pixelated graphics!Simply put, I feel ripped off even though I only payed 10 bucks for this.

THese objectives can range from destroying AT-ATs, protecting a building or convoy, disabling another vehicle, or just straight blowing things up.You will be piloting vehicles such as X-wings, Y-wings, A-wings, Airspeeders, Tie Interceptor, Millenium Falcons, Naboo Starfighters, Ford Lincons (Yes, you can fly a Ford Lincon), though most missions will restrict you to one or two the first time around.If you plan on buying this game, install it instantly and test it out.

Don't even think about trying this on keyboard. You'll thank me later.I remember this game extremely well from the N64 era. Though I imagine for a lot of people, you might remember Shadows of the Empire better than this game, it's still a worthy entry to the Star Wars series, set between Episodes 4 and 5 of the movie series. I spent countless hours in the original flying around, blasting the Empire's forces to pieces, and eventually I got the Gold Medal for every single mission in the game (No easy task, especially on some missions).Update #2 (April 3): I've now Gold Medalled every mission in this release of the game too, so I can verify they're all doable.Now that the PC rerelease is out, consider this game if you're a Star Wars fan. Especially if you're into the air combat aspect of Star Wars games.Unfortunately, there's no space combat to speak of in this game (Even when you play one of the bonus missions), so if you're here looking for epic Star Wars-themed space battles.... Look for a different game (Sorry)For you newcomers who are finding this game for the first time on Steam, do NOT expect it to be an easy flythrough and romp through the Star Wars universe. Expect to fail/Game Over many missions repeatedly before passing them. It does become a lot easier once you know what to do and where enemies spawn to reach for many of the elusive Gold Medals, but focus on passing the mission first, and worry about medals and extra stuff after.And finally, don't expect this game to be like Ace Combat, because it really isn't. Take it for what it's worth and you'll have a good time blowing stuff up.Update: After playing with the Steam Port for a bit, the camera is a bit clunky at first and takes some getting used to (You'll be changing it a fair bit to force the game to refocus on the ship, I recommend playing Level 1 repeatedly until you Gold it). And maybe it's just me, but the ships themselves aren't as nimble as I remember... Or maybe it's just been so long since my last playthrough that I'm rusty...Now excuse me while I swipe an X-wing and blow up some more Imperial forces..."
,Recommended,455910,31527544,Posted: 3 May,all,Jhales,"As much as I am all about playing one of my favorite games from my childhood, I do have to warn future buyers. The controls are a mess. You pretty much have to use a controller, but even then it's not very intuitive. The mouse controls like a joystick and by default has the Y axis reversed. You'll pretty much have to learn the controls through trial and error since there aren't any prompts and the control options are pretty basic (all controller buttons are given a number, so if you choose to reset them, you'll have to tinker with which button is which number).The camera will always be your enemy and will get you killed unless you constantly wrestle with it.On the Xbox One controller, the default for switching camera angles is the Menu button. It's going to be your best friend. If you boost, it is highly likely that the camera will be left behind while your ship races off to become a small speck on the screen. This can also happen when just flying around without the boost. Sometimes at the end of a boost the camera will snap back to where it was before, but that isn't always guaranteed.If the camera is abandoned in battle (and it will, many times) press the Menu button to get the camera back behind your fighter. The cockpit cam may seem like a good solution for this and it is, as long as you are ok with your aim becoming off and shots no longer going where you want them to, also you will probably hit more things.All in all, it's good to be able to relive a N64 classic (yes it did come out on Windows 98, but it was more commonly played on the N64) but it does come with the price of reliving 20 year old design sensibilities and graphics. But seriously, don't forget to mash that Menu button after every boost or when you see your fighter getting further away."

I remember playing on N64 when I was 6, how some missions could be hard for me and I had to get my dad to pass this level. I even remember the first time I got a game over: crashed on the ground after picking up the controller.When I bought this game the other day, I just loved. When I started the game first time, I yelled: MY CHILDHOOD! MY CHILDHOOD!!!!!! and I was amazed by the game intro. This game is really good, the graphics are awesome and the missions have some varieties, such as saving allies, destroying buildings/ennemies, infiltrate, escort, race (but only once for this one). Anyway, you can play it with a controller, with keyboard or a mouse/keyboard combo. That was harder to play with the mouse so I only played keyboard.Good- The missions objectives- Really nice graphics- Easy to play on keyboard (only requires a bit of practice)- The ships you can use are pretty nice to use and varied- Access to more ships after you beat a mission for the first time (Except missions with an obligatory ship)- Some nice challenges to have a gold medal (Finish the mission fast, kill enough ennemies, good accuracy, etc.)- My childhood played this game.- The game itself. Period.Neutral- Game lenght? Honestly I have no idea where to put this. 100% completed the game in 9 hours. Well I had the advantage of playing it when I was a kid, so it influenced on my skills.- The price of the game. Well in fact I only want to add it costed around 5$ CAN during the summer sale, when usually its around 10-11$ CAN. A reasonnable price for me.Not good- The camera. Sometimes it just doesn't follow you or doesn't stay close to you if you go too fast with the Naboo Starfighter or A-Wing (Just press f1 when you can control your ship after your mission started and its fixed).- Play with the mouse is not easy. Messed up big time on first mission, so I tried keyboard instead.- Difficulty can be pretty high on certain levels. Difficulty coming from having lots of ennemies attacking you or the allies you must protect. Good thing its only in 2-3 missions.Final noteWell, now its done, I have to sit there and wish for Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2: Rogue Leader from Nintendo Gamecube to come on Steam."

Sandurz,"A true nostalgic throwback to the days of low-poly 3D models, cheat codes, and hidden levels, Rogue Squadron 3D benefits by the fact that it actually holds up very well as a game. The controls are simple and smooth, making flying X-Wings, A-Wings, and all other manner of Rebel Alliance aircraft a joy -- at least with a controller plugged in. I haven't played with a keyboard and mouse, and some of the other reviews indicate that it's a bit of a nightmare. Very light on story, but it does have a great variety to levels, from search-and-rescue to escort missions (surprisingly not awful) to guerilla-style hit-and-run raids. On top of that, there is ample incentive to replay levels to find secret weapon upgrades and earn gold medals to unlock hidden levels, such as the Death Star trench run and the Battle of Hoth.All that said, I found camera a little irritating. The game has a variety of camera options, some of which you are bound to prefer to others, yet does not allow you to set a default favorite, leading to frantically switching out camera options at the beginning of a level. This never really affected my gameplay experience all that much, but the option to set a default would have been nice.(I was also somewhat disappointed by the AT-ST cheat this time around. The N64 version featured it as a hidden level where you rampage around a Rebel base, destroying everything in sight and sending the Rebel scum fleeing for their lives. This time around, you just play the ordinary levels as an AT-ST, which can be good fun, but the levels are obviously not designed for ground-based combat. Since this is optional cheat code content, I can't really strike the game for it, but I was a little let down.)With that caveat, this is an easy recommend. Scramble your fighters, and may the Force be with you."

And It had controller support which worked pretty well for me since the left stick controls the ships direction.Take some notes.. here is the worst part of the game...Keyboard and mouse setup was terrible for me, the mouse controls the ships directions and would make make me turn more then I intended when going after targets and is a huge cost to accuracy.Controller setup was a pain but managed it with the PS4 controller and Steam Big Picture Mode. Not all functions were use on the controller but key elements for the different vehicle in the game. (Speeder specifically)Analog triggers (L2 and the R2) in the controller setup is also terrible as it serves as a button and an axis (Or rotation... I don't really know... I'm no wizard...)  so you would want to avoid using them.(Note that the left stick is still pretty sensitive but still playable).Once that was figured out the camera seems strange at the start of missions, the only fix was to use a Cycle Camera button. (one press on Camera Cycle is all you need as it follows the ship how it did in N64..) When using the thrust button and making sharp turns the camera will have trouble following the ship for a bit.If your not afriad of any of this and still want this, then happy gaming and have fun, there is also a cheat code system you can google around to see what else you can do...Taking control of an AT-ST!! : D code is  CHICKEN  start any mission and have fun figuring out how to play it.

,Not Recommended,455910,24128549,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,DAI YUNGA,"Rogue Squadron is an excellent combat flight game. Simple (albeit slightly heavy) controls, a wide variety of mission types, and a fun selection of ships make this a game easy and fun for anyone to pick up and play. On the other hand, if you're a perfectionist, getting all gold medals on every mission will take real effort (Fest and Sullust have probably driven everyone to frustration multiple times). Even the cheat codes are fun (KOELSCH, anyone?). This is easily one of the best games on the N64, and worthy of a place in anyone's library.Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the PC version. Being an older game, it's understandable that it doesn't work 100% out of the box, and there are guides on steam for getting it to cooperate with specific controllers and modern OSes, but absolutely nothing got it to work for me. The game launcher would give the all-clear after checking my specs, the main menu would load, but the game would crash to desktop as soon as I selected a stage from the briefing room. I managed to get the Mos Eisley stage to run after following the guides on Steam, but from there the game had all sorts of other problems.The controls were not very responsive, especially compared to the N64 version. I had to constantly wrestle with them to do anything simple like steer at low speeds, and I also had the camera issue many people mention, in which the camera will simply stop following your craft. You are still centered in the screen, but your ship just flies off into the distance, and the only way to fix it is to keep changing the camera view. Having try harder to control the ship than actually completing the mission is a real deal-killer to me. The in-game time displayed here on Steam does not reflect the amount of time I spent just getting the game to run properly through any method, something to consider when buying any older PC game.The combination of not being able to get this game to run consistently on my computer and the faulty controls (neither my xb360 nor my logitech f310 controllers worked with any method) means I cannot recommend this game. If you DO buy it, just make sure to give the guides on Steam for getting it to work properly in the event that it plays as terribly for you as it did for me. Some lucky people report absolutely no problems out of the box, and some people report success after following the guides. I'll stick with my N64 cart."

If your mouse sensitivity is anywhere below max the game will not respond at all until you move your mouse significantly, then it will overcompensate and move your ship equally far, making precision flying impossible.  If your sensitvity is at max then the constantly turn in which ever direction you moved it last and refuse to fly in a straight line, also making precision flying impossible.I genuinely love this game, but I'd rather see proper port than continue to fight these controls.

First things First graphics are horribly outdated, granted its almost 20 years after its original release. Gameplay is typical flight sim with basic controlls, though growing up with this game on the N64 Using a USB version of that controller and rebinding the controlls to it makes it easy for those who had it on those systems. I havent had any issues with controller compatability with the Elite controller, the Dual Shock 4, or a joystick. Second the micro patch steam has introduced does make the game playable on most systems provided you are running on a 64bit system, as it was not designed to run on 64 bit systems. 32bit i havent tried though issues may arise since you wont run that micro patch, so keep that in mind.Gameplay again is standard arcade flight sim, and while it takes some getting used to for anyone new to the genre, veterans should have no problem adjusting to the game. Most missions are relatively easy though some (Raid on Sullust, Moff Seerdons Revenge, Escape from Fest) do require some gold medals on other missions to become easier. Tough one thing to keep in mind is that there is a camera bug that will cause the camera to pan out indefiently at random intervals. Changing the camera to Cockpit or doing a full camera reset will make it go away, and this bug has been present since the original release (usually happens when trying to run 16:9 Resolutions, stick to 4:3). Missions are farly straight forward and consist of the following: Escort something, Defend Something, or destroy certain targets. Each mission is timed, and rewards are given for the following: Time taken, Enemies destroyed, Friendlys saved (If applicable), Accuracy, and Items Collected (If applicable). Do missions faster, with more enemies destroyed, few casualties, high accuracy, and collect the 1 item on the map (if applicable) to get medals which unlock 3 bonus missions, as well as 2 ships. Getting gold on some missions is a nightmare without prior tech (looking at you Fest and Sullust). Ships for said missions are usually locked to a default ship (Usually Xwing), though after completing the mission once you can use other ships which makes getting gold runs easier. The Prequal N1 Naboo Starfighter is also available, and while the movie wasnt great, this ship is one of the few good things that came out of that movie. For added Difficutly enter code ""ACE"" to make it even harder.So while the game can be completed in a few hours with a good run (beat all misisons on gold rather easily since i still played regularly), it offers a nice taste of Star Wars combat. I would recomend this game, though its best played in bursts instead of one long haul. Some nice little codes you can use to help is this: IGIVEUP (Infinite lives), CHICKEN (Play as an ATST), FARMBOY (Unlock Millennium Falcon), MAESTRO (Unlocks Soundtrack), DIRECTOR (Unlocks All Cutscenes), GOODGUYTIE (Unlocks Tie Interceptor: MUST HAVE FALCON UNLOCKED FIRST).TLDR: Good game few issues with camera, decent adition for 10 bucks. Recomend playing in bursts."

I'm sure it wasn't, as I was MUCH younger back then. That said, this game has a number of flaws. It may sound nit-pickey, but leaving these flaws in this re-release is just ♥♥♥♥ing lazy. There's no excuse for this. It's not like they spent thousands of hours designing a game, and left a few small parts unpolished; I'd be more forgiving if that were the case, but there was zero effort put into this re-release. I recommend that you go buy an old N64 and play this game properly, instead of rewarding lazyness with your money. You will get a much better experience out of it.Things that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off about this game:Half the game is designed for a mouse, the other half for a game pad. For instance, there's no way to map a controller's start button to bring up the menu in-game (using just the game, not joy2key or something), but once you press Esc and actually get to the menu, you'll find it's designed for a game pad. If you want to use the mouse for this menu you can't just point and click, you have to move it around, because the game thinks the mouse is a joystick. You can get used to it, sure, but why do I have to have a keyboard, mouse, AND a game pad all right in front of me just to play a game THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR A GAMEPAD?The chart indicating which ships you can use on the level you're about to play is almost never right, and the use-any-ship-on-any-level cheat doesn't seem to work. I can't remember if this was a problem on the original or not. Either way, it's the result of lazyness.The camera won't keep up with the ships. If you speed boost, lots of the time the ship will fly off into the distance, and you have to press the camera angle button to get it back to normal. This happens so often, it's almost unplayable. Rogue Squadron is an amazing game, and it's such a shame that a game breaking bug like this would ever see the light of day."

The game has a launcher where you can calibrate a ""Joystick"", but the dropdown list of recognized gamepads is empty, which means it's looking for a compatible windows-recognized game-controller but is not finding one... the steam controller is a mouse and keyboard according to windows. This means that the in-game joystick/gamepad settings do not accept any input, because no controller was loaded from the launcher. So... the remaining possibility is to configure the steam controller as keyboard/mouse and set the ingame binds accordingly (since the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse). After some messing around, I got the steam controller joystick to produce a mouse signal for the game to use, so that the joystick would steer the ship. But (as another reviewer pointed out) the mouse control is totally messed up, delayed+unresponsive... so the only way to make this work is to steer the ship with arrow keys... the joystick can be configured to simply replicate keypresses of the arrow keys, but then you have no control over the speed at which you steer, so you might as well play the game with a SNES controller... eugh, I spent hours hoping that I could figure out a way to at least make it feel ok... even if it was a tricky configuration... but I've concluded that it is not possible. Additionally, if you try to configure the steam controller specifically for the game, it doesn't work... it will stay with your Desktop configuration after the game is launched... so as I was testing, I had to keep going back to the main controller config (not in the game's menu) and manually changing my desktop config... I hope this makes enough sense, and that if you're hoping to use a steam controller for this game, you will understand what I'm talking about and not waste your time like I did.I even have the N64 cartridge... just thought it would be nice to play high frame-rate with newer hardware/controller... guess I'll be refunding this and busting out the N64 :P"

There's not much character developemnt or major EU legends gound breaking things to see here. But all the fun is playing in Luke's X-wing, and several other Rebel ships shooting down tie fighters blowing up the imperials crap.The Pc port gets  the most criticism for not being like the N64 version, for being buggy, or not even running at all on a top notch pc. I'm glad Steam has released this game on here so it can fix all those issues, GOG also has released this game and it works pretty well on there too. I haven't had issues, i think it has do with what kind of pc you have.One thing i have a problem with the pc version, is the fact the camera gets really annoying, your ship would fly away from your camera really fast, there are some ways to fix it like switching craft positions or dying at least once.Setting up a controller is pretty annoying, i use the xbox 360 and an xbox one controller and i generally would like to set it up to a degree i would like it, but i'm just fine with where its set up as default controls with some tweaks the control setup.Other than that, its a good port to steam hopefully as time goes on, this game will increase in popularity and the mod community will grow and people will be able to mod this game and make new interesting missions, i only hope. Now Steam, Disney, EA or whoever is running the Star Wars floor of games, RELEASE MORE CLASSICS TO STEAM!

Keyboard and mouse controls are a bit clunky but my Xbox One controller has full support and is way more comfortable than the N64. You can pilot multiple vehicles and take on a vast majority of missions. In a mission you can also search for weapon upgrades and try to get enough requirements to reach a gold medal to unlock more crafts. Another plus, unlike other Star Wars games, this one mostly has original music thats fits John Williams scores very well. I highly recommend to pick this up to prove that this game takes skill to fly unlike Battlefront EA's lock on, insta-dodge mechanics, and QTE AT-AT takedowns. Hopefully we'll see a Rogue Squadron Trilogy remaster in the future for both console and PC, more people need to experience the Star Wars games back when they were good."

But there are more bad outcomes than good in this remake.The framerate stays super smooth as if you were playing MGSV: The Phantom Pain, and the same decent sound and voice acting from the N64 version. However, it's the controls and camera that needs work. The keyboard controls are OK. Not GOOD, but OK. The biggest problem is the mouse controls. It's rigged and to hard to control. The easiest way to control your craft is to use the arrow keys, and even THAT sucks. You'll find yourself in a tight situation in a mission, or you'll find yourself close to crashing, making you press hard (and I mean REALLY hard) on the arrow keys, and eventually they'll break, leaving you to buy another keyboard. But what's worse is if you have a laptop, you'll be spending weeks or even MONTHS looking for new arrow keys to fit. It's much easier to connect an N64 controller, or even an XBOX controller to have fun with this game. And with the camera, it doesn't even stay behind your craft. It's easier when using the super-close camera angle by pressing F1, and you can see how fun that's gonna be.My final statement: Unless you have an N64 or XBOX controller, this game is a waste of ten dollars, leaving you to play the original N64 version. Even the N64 emulator version would be easier to play than THIS.I give this PC remake of an already great game a 3/10."

It's much more of an arcade game than a sim, but there's some degree of story as you follow Luke and Rogue Squadron to a number of planets, but if you have a joystick it'll make all the flying a lot more realistic.Space missions wouldn't be featured until the sequels (which were criminally never released for PC), but there are a variety of planets featured here, including Tatooine, Corellia, Kessel, and Mon Calamari. The ships are all quite unique as well (my beloved B-wing wasn't included until the sequels) and you can have lots of fun trrying the non-default ship for certain missions. The three (four including a cheat code land vehicle) ""secret"" ships are fun too.A must-have for any fan of classic Star Wars games!"

So far, there doesn't seem to be a lot of technical issues on my part since my MSI Gaming laptop is a Windows 10 (formerly 8.1 before the upgrade)...so yeah, that's about all I can say at the moment.Still, highly recommended. Although on a personal note, Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader (on GameCube) is the best in the trilogy from Factor 5.Now, I think it would be lovely if the PC version of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire also came to Steam...but for the time being, I guess I'll settle forGOG.comjust to see it again.

The sound, the look, everything about it I love. The missions are endearing and fun, even in some of it's simplicity. Everything down to the ships in their uniqueness between one another. Its a shame that in saying that the controls are absolutely atrocious, the camera has a mind of its own and loves to break the game, and the game itself goes into a frenzy of obscene proportions if you so much as move the mouse slightly too far and hit a menu outside of the game. (Yes. The mouse is not bound inside the game) Not to mention, when you attempt to Alt+F4 this atrocity once it's begun its Coup on your computer you're met with an unforseeable amount of pain and trouble. So, if that doesn't faze you and you're able to enjoy this game through its hellish controls and miserable port then it's a blast of incredible nostalgia of the best kind. Also, a tip, open your Task Manager, click 'Options' and select 'Always on top' to save yourself a world of pain once Rogue Squadron goes 'Rogue'"

Both friendly and hostile AI is hopeless and the levels are small,  but the game is still pretty fun to play. There are issues with the port, controller support is so-so (and mouse controls are worthless, use keybad or stic) and you might encounter some bizarre bugs (my examples: secondary weapon firing every time that primary weapon is fired, primary weapon jamming and not stopping shooting... some of the bugs ceased when i plugged controller in, even if i was not using it to play. there are also smalla camera issues and control jams), but if you manage to get everything in working order, it will be worth a sale prize and a flythrough."

One of the premier dogfighters of all time, Rogue Squadron is still a smooth operator with plenty of replayability, but all is not well in the galaxy far far away. First off, you'll need a controller as the M/KB setup is awful. Also, there's only a few resolution options available, so prepare to play in windowed mode. Menus are unsightly, achievements are sorely missing, but the worst offender is the goofy default camera option which is set to hang back while your ship flies off into the distance. Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3D isn't a bad game by any means, but if the stage is being set for the remainder of a remastered trilogy, let's hope for better treatment.http://zbrstreetgang.subdork.net/2016/06/steam-quickies-4.html"

Also, F1 gives you an effective camera angle, the default camera angle leads to the controls not making sense intuitivley  and the craft doing unexpected things. This is a classic in the same way goldenye is a classic, it was revolutionary for it's time and i still enjoy picking it up but it pales in comparison to modern combat simulators."

It features all the best vehicles and characters from Star Wars, in a story set just after the event of Return of the Jedi, where Luke Skywalker's brave Rogue Squadron protect numerous star systems from the Empire, rescuing defectors and using their information to deliver devastating strikes against Imperial bases.The game definitely holds up to today's standards. While it's almost necessary to use a controller, it is still an incredible game, featuring LucasArt's best music and sound effects, a compelling story, exciting gameplay, and complex missions, that reward unlockable vehicles for that late-game pwnage.This game was my favourite when I played in on the Nintendo 64, my favourite when I found the PC version at an old garage sale, and now my favourite again on Steam.

The game is virtually unplayable on a high resolution monitor and mouse. It doesn't auto center so you'll start drifting off to the side and found the craft uncontrollable even on low sensitivity probably better with a joystick but if you are buying a joystick for this then go find the original as the graphics aren't much improved and sadly the mouse controlls are just not suited for the high resolution of today.
