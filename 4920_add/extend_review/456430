This was a very fun game and the challenges were a good level of difficulty. Not too easy, nor are they maddeningly insane.The music, artwork and atmosphere are excellent and I would definitely recommend this game to those who enjoy this style of computer game as well as those who may like challenges, puzzles and of course an old fashioned Christmas or holiday setting. You won't be disappointed!One last bit to mention... This game is NOT too long, nor too short. I feel it had just about the right amount of things to do within a decent amount of time. As of now I have 3.7 hours in the game, but that isn't 100% accurate as I was playing on my laptop got about 1/3 of the way through, then decided to play on my desktop PC instead. Sadly, the game doesn't appear to have cloud save capability so when I started on my desktop, I had to start from the beginning which I didn't mind much anyway.I hope this group releases more games like this. Perhaps based around other holidays like New Years, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, etc... Two Thumbs Up here!"

While I've logged about 6 hours, easily 2-3 of that was idle, since I made a point of idling out the (surprisingly expensive!) cards before ever playing the game.HO scenes are ok, never hard.  Plotline is... um, well, you start off stranded at a candy house because your car turned into candy, and now three totally not-witch sisters want you to perform various totally reasonable tasks to get it running again.  Tasks like finding a piece of mail (it's in the mailbox); prying up their stairs (to find out what's hidden in there!); and taking apart clocks and other household devices (so you can build a magic panel that needs a gear one of them eventually gives you, so that you can find the lilac branch and grind it into powder by using a mortar & pestle and combining it with a chocolate bunny and maple syrup, of course!).The plot is fairly simple and striaightforward, and the 'hint' button pretty much always works if you're stuck, or just have a bad memory.Creativity/how high on goofballs: 8/10kaleidescopic range of color: 10/10 - it's  a pretty game.would keep a kid busy/kid-safe game: 10/10May help put an adult to sleep: 8/10Ease of achievements: 10/10- just takes some timeEndgame: For $1.99 it's not a bad buy, but knowing what it is now, I wouldn't pay that price again; wait for a sale (that is probably coming up soon for, you know....

There are a few spelling errors and object description errors that are just an inconvenience. The puzzle element of the game is interlocking, so lots of things you get are used with other things that you get. The story line is extremely limited and acts only as a vehicle to advance the puzzles. All in all, it is worth it for the extremely low price."

However, you arrive in front of an house, belonging to three old sisters. They apparently messed up and want to help you. However, first, you'll have to help them...This is a short adventure game. The story is just ""help the sisters for tasks like finding what to make clothes for birds and you'll be on the road again"". There is no evil plot, no hidden secret, nothing. In other words, Christmas Adventure's story is just inexistent.The gameplay isn't innovative as all, as it's find items, use them, clear hidden objects scenes and solve some puzzles. But there is a little problem with the gameplay. Actions to make aren't always making sense, some new areas are appearing out of the blue and I often existed the hidden objects scenes because while trying to click on an object, I was in reality in the exit area. Besides, you have just 4 locations: the three rooms where the sisters are and outside. You don't visit anything else.The graphics are acceptable, they're fitting to the Christmas ambiance. The soundtrack is also reflecting this.I should have known that for the price, I wasn't getting a great hidden object game. True, it's well polished. But when you're used to play longer games, you're kinda deceived. However, I would have probably given a thumb up if actions were making sense and if I was seeing more than four locations. However, I was disappointed in the end. I didn't really enjoy the game - and trust me, it's pretty rare when I'm thumbing down a casual game."

The places to visit are limited which can sometimes be a nice thing if you want to play something relaxing. But not all the things that need doing makes sense, but you'll figure it out it's by no means hard.It's a cute Christmas game or if you're missing Christmas and you like hidden object games, but there are way better hidden object games out there than this.

While some of the objects were holiday-related, there wasn't really a holidy feel to this game at all.It's a very short game at about 2 hours at most to complete. There are only 4 locations. Each one is fairly loaded with puzzles though. Some of the logic on where to put what items you find seemed off at times.The story seemed very arbitrary, help a few women do some random stuff in exchange for a magical cure to fix your car.There is either no music, or a single track from the Nutcracker on loop (that I can recall hearing). I don't remember much in audio in general.I found a single typo. Once asked to find a ""dool"" when it meant ""doll.""It wasn't always easy to discern what all the objects were in each puzzle, but as a test, I started selecting items from the screen that somehow stood out from the base image and was able to find most of them without even reading the item list. So it's pretty obvious what the target items are. When you revisit a hidden object location, it's extra easy to find objects, because they are all new objects that weren't there the last time.The hint tips are useful and there wasn't any limit on using them. However, it didn't always direct me to move to a different location when needed. If it didn't point to anything, I knew to visit the other three areas.It's okay for $1.39 (the sale price I paid).
