I love Rebel Assault 2 and will always love it, but if you never played these games twenty years ago, spare yourself.The gameplay is criminally substandard in both games and they were marketed based on how mind blowing the visuals and the presentation were for a video game. The ""movie like presentation"" is no longer impressive given the video and audio compression, plus all the 90s cgi. It's a pretty corny game. (although that may appeal to some)Each game consists of levels which can be categorized into reflex cursor action, cover shooting, or vehicle based obstical avoidance. If you have an itch for any of those, this game is the last thing you should scratch it with."

The game ranges from a cockpit space shooter, obstacle course, and light gun game where you control a Rebel through a Star Wars story exclusive to this game. The game plays great on modern computers, and it runs out of the box with both games. I reccomend Rebel Assault 2 since it has more adventure and gameplay features that you would be expecting.My cons are that the obstacle course with the space craft is SOOOO buggy without a physical joystick. You NEED a joystick, the mouse emulation is close to impossible to use and enjoy fully. Get a classy joystick if you wanna fully enjoy.Verdit: Buy it/11"

These games were ment to be played with a joy stick, I have one but the game doesn't register it. I took a look in the configuration options and it can be changed to work on the mouse, but the controls are still terrible,In Rebel Assault 1 you start off in a flight sequince, and it feels like the T16 is fighting back while you try to fly, good luck lasting thirty seconds here.Rebel Assault 2 starts with a gunnery mission, not to hard. Then goes to a in-and-out-of-cover shooting gallery mission, and finally, another flight segment like the first game, again good luck.Both games feel like they were made for an arcade and while they were something way back in the day, I think it would have been better if these stayed forgotten. If you have a really old joy stick laying around or if you are just nuts about the oldies, I can't stop you. Other than that, this game would need some re-tooling to be playable."
76561197970739339,Recommended,456540,31529547,Posted: 3 May,all,Captain Chaos,"The Rebel Assault series were two of my favorite games growing up, and my first experience of the now largely defunct rail shooter genre. Released in 1993 and '95 respectively, the first title was Lucasarts' first CD-only release and one of the earliest titles on PC to use FMV cutscenes, which allowed it to have far more sophsiticated visuals then PCs of that era could otherwise have rendered. A lot of effort went into the feel of the games, using music and sounds effects lifted directly from the classic trilogy, and in the second game, Stormtrooper armor taken straight from Lucasfilm's prop library. Fans of other classic Lucasarts titles will notice things like the X-Wing's interior display looking much like the one from the X-Wing games, and the E-11 Blaster Rifle's first-person sprite being identical to the one from Dark Forces, creating an internal consistency that is sadly lacking in the Star Wars of today.However, the games were oft-criticized for their janky controls and today, the visuals do not hold up at all well, with poor resolution and lots of fuzzy pixels. Today's ""gamer"" probably would not enjoy either title, but if you're me, this bundle is well worth its sale price for the nostalgia factor alone. Featuring the vehicles and campy style that made us love the original films, the Rebel Assault series tells an alternate version of the Galactic Civil War, staring a daring rebel pilot known only as Rookie One. The first title allowed you to set One's gender, a rarity in games of the time, though in the sequel the character was always male. The levels switched up perspectives where possible, with some levels putting you in the cockpit of a ship aiming at incoming Tie Fighters, or with a chase cam dodging walls and obstacles, others putting Rookie One on foot battling Stomtroopers. The second game introduced the rarely-seen Tie Phantom, a cloak-capable specialist assault fighter that would reappear in a handful of later Star Wars media, such as the Forces of Corruption expansion to the Empire At War RTS, an element I wished they had used more often, and the idea of a ""Bermuda Triangle"" esque region of the Star Wars Galaxy called the Dreighton Nebula, apparently famous for stories of ghost ships, creating the perfect backdrop for the Empire to develop cloaking fighters.In terms of this Steam release of the games, they are perfectly functional given that they are emulated through DOSBox, which is included in the download. They are playable using a mouse, joystick, or even an Xbox 360 controller if you are so inclined. I actually recommend the mouse at least in the case of the second game, which allows you to account for the overly-sensitive movement of the chase-cam levels with small mouse movements, because of this I only screwed up in one level involving a speeder bike run through a swampy area, due to the tight confines of the trees making it very easy to pin-ball your bike all over the place before you can properly react.If you enjoy classic Star Wars and/or rail shooter games, the Rebel Assault series might be worth a look. However, you might find the Dark Forces or X-Wing games more to your liking."

The controls make this game unplayable.  I only tried out RA2, not RA1, so I can't speak to that particular game, though I imagine the problems are similar.  If I use a mouse, it makes the first-person rail shooting sections easy enough to aim and fire with, which admittedly is pretty nice.  However, on any sort of third-person flight level (like the first half of Mission 3 in RA2), the mouse is too slow to respond and you crash into almost everything.  I switched to my Logitech controller to use its joystick, and the opposite problem occurred.  The control became way too sensitive.  I started weaving and zig-zagging like a drunken pilot, and I *still* crashed into everything, though not quite as much as before.  But on the second half of Mission 3, it switches back to first person, and the joystick is AWFUL for aiming.  Since you can't switch from joystick to mouse mid-level, that meant Mission 3 was going to be nigh unbeatable for me, so I just threw my hands up and asked for a refund.  What a disappointment."

76561198010608791,Recommended,456540,28663745,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,SeriousStrelok,"NOTE: I'm recommending and rating this based on REBEL ASSAULT 2.I wasn't sure what to think when I saw this package. Some of the reviews weren't particularly in favour. Nonetheless, being a 90's kid I still hold some nostalgia for that era of PC-joystick gaming, so was keen to look further in. Initially, both games follow the storyline of Rookie One, a Rebel pilot as he battles the Empire. The overall design is as a rail-shooter which comes in 3 styles for spaceship (canyon run, first-person rail-shooting and the same with obstacle-dodging added in) and ocassional TPS cover shootouts. While I'm not generally a fan of the rail shooter genre, I could forgive it thanks to gameplay variety (satisfying even by today's standards) and combination of FMV and arcade elements such as scoreboard which give some replay value. Plus it's still STAR WARS!Having completed Rebel Assault 2, I can almost see why these games often make it to ""Worst SW Games"" lists. However, that should be for the broken RA1 as not only was the sequel extremely fun and nostalgic, but it did a number of things really well. In purchasing this you automatically receive both games, but I will review them separately so you can decide if the package as a whole is worth it for you.REBEL ASSAULT 1:Oh my... if this were sold as a standalone I'd demand an immediate refund. I could overlook the extremely dated graphics if it weren't for the horrendous controls. Admittingly I no longer own a joystick, but that's no excuse for the impossible mouse controls. The canyon runs are terrible for it; the ship often collides with walls even when they seem distant, and during the times when the ship DOES respond to mouse movement it over-leaps. It's therefore just about impossible to complete Chapter 4. Which is a shame as the game could still be moderately interesting if ypu could actually progress more often than you rage-quit.Pros:- Good for its time I guess, technology-wise- Definitely Star WarsCons:- Your vehicle has a life of its own, and wishes to see it end- Nearly impossible to complete due to control sensitivityREBEL ASSAULT 2:A real breath of fresh air. I'm serious! This one I actually completed as I'm posting this. The cutscenes and graphics are a big step up from the original. Not as impressive as at its time yes, but has aged well enough. At the very least the game's levels still appear awesomely cinematic. The classic SW sound/music and space vehicles are all there, so nothing to question about those. The scoreboards are still featured, with one new improvement from the original being the inclusion of level/chapter selection which makes the game easier to complete. Not to mention getting to choose which of your favourite scenarios to replay (final mission is among my favourites). Incidentally, a few of RA1's flaws are more or less repeated. Canyon runs are more polished, though still very tough. It remains a chore estimating distance to turn/move and when exactly to dodge. Same for the first-person rail-flight-dodging levels. Luckily they send arrow signals when evasive manoeuvres are necessary. Unfortunately they are sometimes so sudden you have little choice besides constant trial-and-error to memorise the precise moments you need to move. BEAR IN MIND that unlike RA1 these segments are not impossible and can be completed with a mouse, just require some patience.The storyline and writing is really good. Its ending cinematic even provides a similar feel to Episode 4's throne room (with cute romance added in). Darth Vader's dialogue is spot-on and well-impersonated, though the same can't exactly be said for everybody; the actors for Rookie One and some of the rebels can be unignoreably cheesy at times. As common as that might be for FMV in games (especially the 90's) I still thought they could do much better given the standard set by the actors portaying other characters like Vader and the Imperial Officers. Nonetheless, I was able to overlook all that. After all, it's a given to expect some degree of cheesiness in a SW film or game. Most importantly it didn't tarnish enjoyment of the game's storyline and protagonist as well as the interactive action.Pros:- Difficult, but much less so than its predecessor- Well-aged 90's graphics- Cinematic story and gameplay sequences- Good gameplay variety- Intense final mission- Darth Vader is menacing as ever- Fun to replayCons:- Sometimes requires patience and perseverance- A couple of space levels look identical- Stormtroopers and TIE Fighters are 95% accurate shots.BOTTOM LINE:So this is what you can expect if you add to your cart. Personally I think it's well worth getting just for RA2. As atrocious as RA1 is to play, RA2 is a terrifically improved title. Contrary to those critic's lists I'd actually go as far as to say RA2 is one of the best SW Game Titles (if you don't count KOTOR, LEGO Star Wars, Battlefront 1/2, Empire At War). At least it gave me personally enough enjoyment to warrant that. You decide, but for RA2 I very much recommend!85/100"
,Not Recommended,456540,32583463,Posted: 19 June,all,eXpod,"Just say no. The first level of Rebel Assualt 1, and the third level of Rebel Assault 2 are ship piloting levels. That's also as far as I was able to get. Terrible terrible controls."
,Not Recommended,456540,24088019,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Olde,"I played Rebel Assault 2 as a kid on Windows 95. The controls were frustrating then and they still are today. I mostly replayed Rebel Assault 2, which I beat in an hour and a half on beginner difficulty and don't feel bad for not beating it on a harder setting. The game here consists of three different types of games: flying, shooting, and flying while shooting. It's an FMV game, meaning the game will play an FMV in the background while you move your ship or character throughout the game, very much like a shooter in an arcade. The graphics are surprisingly good considering their age, though sound is a bit spotty.The main problem I have with the game is the downright atrocious controls. What always killed me as a kid was goddamn level 3, where you pilot the Millenium Falcon through some trenches. I feel like it would be easier to actually pilot the real thing than play the game. The problem is that the mouse controls the direction that the ship goes, and if you get hit once, you go bouncing all over the place, and sometimes the things you have to dodge are impossible. There are three levels like this and they all get harder in difficulty. Even on the easiest difficulty, you'll die a lot. Something I never noticed as a kid is that you can--and should--invert the controls for the flying stages. Normally the flying controls are inverted (up makes you move down, down makes you move up), so actually flipping the controls in the menu makes the stage slightly more doable. The only downside to that is that you can't change it back in the middle of the stage, and in level 3, you have to do some ship fighting in the second half, so the flipped controls don't help on that front. The worst part of the flying stages is that it really comes down to memorization. You have to move your ship in the direction that the arrows point or else you'll take a boatload of damage, though the levels are always the same. However, it's EVEN WORSE in Rebel Assault 1, where there are no arrows at all!Ironically, one of the things that I really liked about the game was that it was so hardcore. There isn't a single health pickup or ammo pickup. It simply relies on skill, being able to move a ship through a corridor without getting hit or timing your shots correctly. Aside from the terrible flying levels, the game feels pretty fair in difficulty. The story isn't anything to get too invested in, although it's decent enough and the entire thing is acted, unlike the cuts to cartoon images of characters talking in Rebel Assault 1. Another thing I really liked about the game was that there was almost no sewer level...almost. They save it for very late in the game and it felt like they could've actually not had it at all, although the sewer level that they have is one of the best levels in the game.The only people I see realistically buying this game are huge Star Wars fans who absolutely NEED every Star Wars game ever made and people who played this in their youth. If you have no connection to this game, there's no need to play it, and also, once you're done with the game once, there's not much replay value. It's just an average arcade shooter. What would've been really nice is if you could control the ship's movements by the keyboard and if you could move the ship in shooting levels. I know the engine at the time was limited but it really feels lacking.I'm not going to review Rebel Assault 1 mostly because I only played three levels and gave up in frustration. I remember seeing someone's playthrough of only the first level and he couldn't even beat it. It's made overly difficult because the controls are even worse than Rebel Assault 2's, there are no directional arrows giving you hints as to where you need to be to avoid taking damage, and you have to know to change the difficulty and flip the controls in the options menu. After the first level, I found the second level infinitely easier, but the third was even harder than the first. Seriously, these flying levels are just insane and it feels cheap. The art design looked cool but I didn't like the narration. Rebel Assault 2 did well to have the story told all through character dialogue.Bottom line is this: if you like FMV games, arcade shooters, or if you played either one of these games back in the 90s and want to relive some nostalgia, you'd probably like to get this on sale. They both run efficiently on DOS-Box, though the controls haven't been fixed. Otherwise, pass. There are much better flying simulators than this."

One is using the keyboard and mouse, the other is using the Flight Stick. So far I think any flight stick will work. On my windows 95 I had like a flight stick you would use for fighter pilot games or Helicopter game like Jane's Lonbow. So two buttons on the top middle, a joystick like button on the top left and the trigger which was red. Plus two turn dials to set up the tail and wingflap sensitivity. Today for the current gen pc of my AlienWars Gaming PC the game I'm using a Thrustmaster joystick set so it comes with the Flightstick and the throttle stick. And I think it says  OS for windows 7, xp and 8. As long as you have the current system or near current system the game should work. I wish Steam could get every Star Wars Game set up to work on Current gen PC's. Would love to play rouge sqaudron 3d, or Force Unleashed 2.
