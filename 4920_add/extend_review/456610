Colours, lightin etc. are just awful and embarrassing.But I know PES is not about graphics and I have to say that gameplaywise we got a few upgrades. Goalkeepers are actually doing their job during the game, passing feels even better.After the first 45 minutes I closed the game and opened PES 2016. Here, I have to add that I have several patches, transfer updates, pitch update installed on PES 2016. The game just felt much better. Even the graphics looked nicer. Colors were brighter and the quality just better. Even the gameplay felt almost the same.So If you are asking me: Does it worth buying it?My answer is a definite NO. Just use PES 2016 with transfer updates and you are safe to go.PES was never for online playing and you can have fun offline with 2016."

People who can afford to pre-order the game, would most likely have the money to afford a decent rig on their pc to run the higher end graphics. What was designed for PC gamers, with the lower end graphics, is probably tailored more for people who torrent.I'm neither a suppporter of Fifa nor Pes. But I feel that what Konami has done is simply shooting themselves in the foot and killing what limited PC supporters that they currently have.Having said that, I dont mind slightly inferior graphics. I do mind, however, 1) long loading times between menus, 2) long waiting times for online matchmaking, 3) frequent disconnection, 4) inability to alt tab (without getting disconnected) while waiting for the game to finish loading.For people who wish to buy a PES title, it would probably be better to choose between whichever title is of the lower price, since the improvements over the titles are only marginal at best. Until massive improvements are made to the core game itself, I would probably not recommend users to buy the game at full price."

,Recommended,456610,33012339,Posted: 29 June,all,RockstarCRO,"The big question on everyone mind is do I buy FIFA (from EA) or do I buy Pro Evolution Soccer (Winning Eleven)? Read on and hopefully you will find your answer as both games have their +'s and -'s. I have played FIFA all my life (since 94) and have been in and out of PES games since 2005. I own both PES 17 and FIFA 17 (which I got for free - thanks HappyHrvat). If I had to make the judgement call I would say PES takes 2017 thanks to its gameplay. If you are one of those players that wants the athletes proper names and clubs, you may want to jump to FIFA. Otherwise, the solid gameplay will definitely shadow what FIFA has to offer.Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 is a rock solid soccer game in my opinion. Thegameplayfeels a little more rigid than FIFA, but I feel the game does everything right. I find there are a lot less glitches and accidents than in a FIFA game. The one outstanding fact that I must point out is that players actually move in this game. Seriously - every single player on the field is engaged in some sort of movement or positioning. Just in case you missed it in the last sentence, EVERYONE ON THE FIELD MOVES!  I find this to be a great feature as no one should ever be stagnant on the soccer field. I have been playing soccer for 22+ years of my life and can tell my reader that if you were caught standing still or barely moving on the field, you would get an immediate sub. FIFA for whatever reason only has a few players moving at one time. I find it is mostly based on position and will only draw other players that are in proximity to the play. PES, however, doesn't force a right back to pass to a right mid or a center back. PES moves all their players around accordingly and will even let you make plays across the field. This is the first notable difference I noticed between FIFA and PES. FIFA may have licences and better graphics, but it doesn't beat PES'sgameplay. I honestly feel the headers, the free-kicks, the 50/50 battles, the tackles and even the technique system (once you get used to it), is a lot better than FIFA.The layout and UI sort of resembles FIFA. There are minor differences between the two especially between PES ""myclub"" FIFA's ""Ultimate Team"". In FIFA, players are constantly on the market trying to sell and bid for players. PES has a bit of a different system; you can hire scouts to find some players for you or you can use special agents to find players that have a higher skill level. You can sign individual players on loan contracts as well, but acquiring new players isn't as much of a grind as it is in FIFA. I got a solid ""gold level"" team within ten games and with the right bonuses. There are other games modes such as skill practice, become a legend and master league. FIFA may have a bit of an upper hand when it comes to its game-modes, regardless, PES will keep you engaged and entertained. At least the game modes are there! The referees all seem to have different personalities and the game itself doesn't seem to have as much tolerance for slide tackles as FIFA does (meaning play clean)! Another major difference is the offside system. I find FIFA's to be more reasonable than PES. PES is very picky about offsides even if your back is slightly behind the last defender. Also - you can dive in this game. Welcome back to the time of FIFA 98 Road to the World cup sort of play! Pretty neat, but watch your timing or face a yellow card!Thegraphicsare pretty good, fluid and have smooth transitions. PES apparently moved to their FOX engine while FIFA uses Frostbite. FIFA seems to have more detail when it comes to their graphics while PES is just slightly behind. I have to admit that the animations that occur when players are tackled or when situations get awkward (players running into one another), things seem to turn out right. I also find that when players go for headers or half-volleys, the way its done just seems appropriate and awesome. Thesoundsand commentators are pretty good. FIFA may have a slight advantage in this realm, but again PES gives FIFA another good shot for their money.Overall, I will have to give the RockstarCRO's 2017 soccer game award to PES. I love FIFA, but within the last few years the same issues keep prodding up and new 99 Messi cards keep appearing. I really hate the fact that not all players are engaged within the play whereas PES has them moving all over. If I had to make a recommendation, I would say choose PES (unless you're completely brand new to soccer in video games).RATING : 8.25/10GameplayA-Story / CampaignBVisuals / User InterfaceBSounds / MusicB-Replay-abilityBOverallB+"

,Not Recommended,456610,28074639,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,GypoGamer,"Buying this game, I knew it would be wack...I bought it because (based on experience) gameplay on PES is superior to FIFA. A much truer representation of the real game. Tempo, Ball Weight, Player positioning, Choices, Adaptation to players on the team, even animations and the choice of animations in a particular scenario is fantastic, gives you a satisfying feeling. You feel as though you can watch a game over the weekend and recreate it later in PES.FIFA on the other hand, (I've played every FIFA since 99 where you had to button mash the triangle button to run faster lol, used to be a fan also) since probably 09 where online multiplayer became an integral part of the game. It has stalled in terms of progress. So called better graphics were prioritised over game mechanics, and focus was solely placed on the multiplayer experience. The really bad AI of the game was hidden behind the fact that you played other humans and loads of licenses, so you only saw the lack of authenticity in gameplay in glimpses.  It became an Arcade game.Now, PES on consoles is going places. Much better graphics, players feel realistic in terms of proportions and movement, shading. You can play by yourself and enjoy the game, online is not needed, it's a welcome addition, etc... My question is....Why the f@%k are PC gamers getting taken the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of?!Why are we playing a last gen game import for two years in a row now? It's ridiculous. If you are scared of people cracking your games then you are loosing a foot in where the industry is heading. More and more people buy products after they have tested them out and been satisfied with the product quality. (product does what it says on the box). Most gaming companies are all following the road of coning customers up until the release date after which they just go quiet and let people buy a half hearted game.No improvement what so ever from the last game. If it wasn't for the fact that. 1. I got it on discount. 2. The modder community is amazing. 3. I am hoping something goes through to Konami where they see that people on PC will buy their game if they don't alienate us from the REAL game.Lastly, don't ever charge 40 quid for what could essentially pass as an Indie game.

This year it has improved (as they claim they do every year), but again, only superficially.And this is the problem of PES, which hasn't been resolved or renewed or looked upon from konami. It seems well polished at first, but the more you play this last last version, the more you feel the 'scripted' flow of the game. AI just changes over time, and consistency has become a chore, not a way of playing. It completely gets the fun out of the game, and out of the joy what football is about. Im not talking about scoring incredible goals, or dribbling your way up to the goalie on a solo run (which has gotten more attention of the programmers every year again), but making space, creating opportunities, opening the game up, forcing it with YOUR team, and not because of the influence of a scripted AI. In honest, you have to know the series to know what im talking about.If you look at gameplay of PES,  you see a typical build-up of football, 'especialy on the higher difficulties: players passing one time passes over the whole field from a large distance (sometimes from immposible physical animations), players always running down a complete flank, which is completely not credible and feels more arcady than realistic. The AI is just a machine and thats exactly how this game feels, playing a machine, it feels like PES is playing you and not the other way around. This was the case after pes 2006, but it only got worse over time ,and every year the developers promise a rehaul, a back-to-the-top experience, but it fails year after year.Dont get me wrong, PES does things quite right, and there are definitely fun factors in the game, and nothing beats a game versus a friend, but what always attracted me in PES was the master league, building your club, improving it, attracting new players, getting stronger in playing the game, adapting to the AI, to eventually playing on the hardest setting and developing your own style untill you 'mastered' it. But the longevity of 2017's gameplay has a short span, and gets repetitve after a while. And thats not what PES is about, or the legacy of PES and its immersive gameplay, those days are long gone, and probably not coming back.5/10"

For years I've bought PES for my PS2 and PC, but it doesn't matter to their (KONAMI's) support. Without even talking about the fact that year after year KONAMI decides that the PC users shouldn't get the finished product, and year after year they releas a less finished version for PC. Without even talking about the amount of licences they omit year after year. I'm talking about being there for your users.After years of playing on daly base I encountered an error on PES 2017, error SGJC 427, while trying to play online. After one update PES team made, I just couldn't play online anymore (played before, didn't do anythong on my computer, and after the update I just couldn't). I restarted my PC, restarted my router, re-installed the game but nothing helped, so I decided to contact the support (after trying to reach them on FB didn't help). After waiting two days for a reply, they told me to restart my router (WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ON THE MESSAGE I SENT, SAYING I JUST DID). So I tried another time, telling them that my message wansn't even read. That time they send me a 10 bullets list, of data I should try to give them (most people I know would've quitted that exact moment). After giving them info about my ISP, network architecture in my country and much more data, I kept waiting for a solution. None was given. They just ingonred my message for about a week. AND I'M SICK OF IT. I'M SICK OF DEVELOPERS THAT DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE USERS THE SECOND THEY GET THE MONEY.Due to the fact that the game is being sold as a multy-player online game, and I cannot play online because of a bug PES develpoers made, I want a refund.Bottom line, DON'T. Just don't buy the game. The second KONAMI got your money, no one will give a damn on your problems, no one will try to help you, no one will answer your questions or try to solve your problems.

On the 4 of 6 scenario, my teammate could not steal the ball even though it was a mostly straight ahead steal).The Game needed to be harder than last year, but getting fouled constantly isn't fun.  They still don't call many fouls.  It's just the AI fouls so much that there is an increase in what is called.   I've switch to the boring one touch passing from end to end(only way to reliably advance the ball) and the AI still usually finishes the game with 4 or 5 yellow cards.  Also, be ready for slide tackles.  The CPU dives constantly.  They've also increased CPU recovery.  So if you beat your man, you may get one unhindered dribble(no guarantee's) before he's slide tackling you again.You have to pretty much always one touch shot as well.  If not the AI will foul you (its never called inside the box....EVER) causing an animation reset, and they will continue to do it until you lose the ball.  The only way to get a penatly called in the box is to skill move.  In about 30 games I've got 2 penalty kicks, both from doing the Ronaldo chop inside the box.Volley's are almost the only way to score lofted through balls.  The slow down on touch is so much, that even a 5-6 step lead will see the cpu steal the ball after a good frist touch.  Even regular through balls suffer from this.They've basically turned the game into a one touch passing game.  You can still win most of the time on superstar doing it, but its boring boring boring.PES 2016 was my first PES. It turned me into a big PES fan.PES 2017 turned me into a big FIFA 17 fan."

I've played Fifa since I owned it on my N64, played 2002,2003,2004,2005, 06,07,08,09,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 and 17. I HATED PES before PES 16 (Except when I was a kid on PSP, PES was life on that thing), I loved Fifa, I have unimaginable amounts of hours on it, I've played Ultimate Team since it was first introduced as DLC in 10 I believe (Wasn't able to buy it and only played the demo but I did play it in the next year). I loved Fifa, It was something you could play and get so angry and so happy at but it felt fair.Over the Years this changed however, I started to mostly notice this in 2016, the game constantly being Unfair, Clear penalties not given, Defence not giving a ♥♥♥♥ and goalkeepers being pointless.I would also like to State I believe EA break their games on release, I noticed that in 2015 with the Out of map glitch which only worked in the FULL game, the demo had no issues and it was not possible, which leads me to believe the demo's are actually better than the final release to give a false impression of the final game. They also allow you to manipulate the game by using Sliders which also somehow made it's way into Offline Ultimate Team somehow which was odd. Enough Conspiracies though.Towards the end of Fifa 16 I gave up and caved into buying PES 2016 and loved it, the tactics and pace of the game felt so much better, Online is bad but 18 will have an open Beta so let's give it a chance.Fifa 17 then came out and I finally conceded, 9 Games in UT 3 wins 3 draws 3 losses, I stopped Playing UT and I haven't gone back since release. And for the first time I bought PES early on and never looked back.Actual ReviewPES 2017 does mostly everything right and actually made some meaningful changes, Advanced Tactics allows you to play to your own style, want your players to Press quickly after losing possesion? Gegen Press. Want your Fullbacks to push? Attacking Fullbacks. Want your defence to ♥♥♥♥ing defend? Pull the defensive line back or play deep defensive line.<--- This is key, no longer will your defence just stand on the halfway line unless you tell them to. AND GOALKEEPERS ARE ALMOST PERFECT, they make realistic saves which means they'll fumble and they may not react in time to block it, but they will actually make decent attempts and are aware of their goal area, meaning no longer is the goalkeeper the weak spot of the team.Graphics, ALRIGHT YES VANILLA LOOKS LIKE♥♥♥♥♥♥ Download PES Smoke Patch and Reshade, the game looks brand new and you can download add ons such as New Scoreboards. The game even includes chants (I've only tested Liverpool's one and it sounds great at the start of a match though doesn't like to trigger in master league from what I've tested)Network, Haven't tested but I know it's most likely♥♥♥♥♥♥so probably wait until 2018 if you want that, I mean why are you here this late anyway if you want Online?Master League - I basically just played this throughout my entire time on here and off here, It's great, it could be better and 18 looks to improve with added Cutscenes and other improvements. I've been very addicted to it though.Commentator - Love them, they don't talk for the sake of talking, there is no ""Oh remember when this happened? Oh remember when you scored that goal lmao"". They also sound real and seem to actually enjoy the match.All in all PES 2017 is a fantastic game."

,Recommended,456610,25829335,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,MJBoyle16,"I decided to re-write my review. I have over 250 hours on this game since it's release last summer, and I have good and bad alike to voice about this game.Before I go into the bullets, I want to mention a major issue with this game (for me).When playing a game, you are assigned stoppage time like IRL. So let's say it's +4 minutes. The issue I have is that if the CPU team has possession during the extra time period, the game won't call time and give a minimum of 2 extra minutes to the CPU. Flip it and YOU have possession. not even 20 seconds after the +4 minutes ends the ref calls the game... EVEN if you are about to score/shoot. and even if they have it in their half and are stalling, it'll be 2+ extra minutes after the end of the 4 minute extra time period before the ref calls the game. I have tested this. I have on nearly every occasion had this happen. For me, this is a big problem. Just had to voice this to everyone.Pro's:-Gameplay is pretty nice, fluid, and easy to get used to.-Goalies are no longer pathetic POS's. They heavily updated and revamped the GK system in the game and in MY opinion, the cpu GK mechanics and over all AI stomps on FIFA 17's system.-Menu's and interface's are easy to use and learn-Creation lacks a little but is still pretty good (Minus crappy facial hair and hair styles). What I mean is that the beards ALL look like stubble. and the hair just looks really fake. Fifa def has the edge over this game on creation.-Visuals outside of matches are pretty decent, put the specs on high to know what I mean.-It's now only 20 bucks.-Game modes are fun and interesting, my favorite being My player and my league, but the online modes are really cool and fairly easy to get used to.CONS:-In match visuals... overall MAYBE equal to very early X-Box 360 days, but definitely PS2 at the least.-Lack of the English leagues and lack of real players. (If this is what you like, go fifa until PES steps up and is able to accomplish this). Also lack of MLS. (All MLS teams likenesses are given to FIFA and EA so don't expect this any time soon).-Creation system could use better looking visuals, better textures, better selection of gear, and better hair and facial hair.-Create a team is pretty much non-existent now. I really loved WE6, 7, 8, and 9, and 10 for this.-originally not worth the 40-60 dollar price tag.Some connection issues playing online, not many in my experience, but does lose connection like expected.With this all being said, I'd still recommend this game, but I'd wait until you can see what PES2018 is going to play and look like. For this particular game there is a group online that did a HUGE overhaul of the game in terms of minor glitches and adding in players and teams. Google SMOKE PES2017 and you'll find it. They provide a step by step install tutorial and it's really easy to get installed and I love it. Adds several different leagues (in packs of 3 leagues and you choose one set of three provided) but they got the German, Japanese, MLS, Chinese, and Colombian leagues added as well as Russian league. So it's nice. Before them, if you add ANY player on a team not included in the major leagues in the base game you got a random alternate player. Again... I do recommend this game, but with PES18 just a month or so away, I'd wait and see if the 59.99 price tag on the new game is worth it over this one's 20 dollar one."

,Recommended,456610,30708218,Posted: 24 March,all,The Once and Future King,"I will recommend the game but with the caveat that you're ready to be frustrated for most of your time playing it.Let's start with the positives:+The  modding community is and likelty always will be the lifeblood of the PES series. The ability and dedication to mod in kits, faces, stadiums, and leagues is what keeps PES alive and competing with FIFA.+The player likeness and the chants for the few teams that are licensed are spot on+The gameplay is a bit more indepth than FIFA, as per usual, and you have the freedom to make a wide range of tactical choices on the fly or before the gameNow then, for the negatives:-The PC version is an absolute horrendous port from a last gen system. I don't even know who thought that was a good idea or why, however most of the amazing screenshots you see on google come from the PS4. The PC version looks like a high end PS2 port, even with graphic upgrades like SweetFX and Reshade.-The off-the-ball AI leaves something top be desired. Unless you are directly controlling the player, they play like idiots. Unless its Neymar or Ronaldo, the AI will not beat its marker and at times will stop mid run and just watch the ball. When mixed with whacky pass tracking, be prepared for a lot of frustration as there's a 50% chance the play you wanted and the play you get will be two different things.-Online play is horrendous and that's often a huge letdown for anybody playing any sports game ever.Really, even after all of its faults its still an enjoyable game. But the oft asked question every year is, ""FIFA or PES?""And this year, FIFA delivered a better product and we can only hope Konami will learn going forward and correct their mistakes. Another PES release as lackluster as this could well see the series slip into rough waters."

ALL under a different name. I get that's maybe not entirely Konami's fault, but you just can not compete with EA in this state. There's no way. The game looks awful. It's a bad port with framerate issues. It just lacks any kind of immersion whatsoever. All that together makes this just void of any realistic experience; it's arcade as can get, which is a shame, because there is however a lot of potential in the gameplay departement. But overall it's just a bad game, I asked for a refund while it's still possible."
,Not Recommended,456610,29098400,Posted: 7 January,all,TomasElTigre,"Another year, another PES, another heartbreaking disappointment.Like the team you love who seems poised for greatness at beginning of the season, only to choke at the vital moments, PES gets so much right, but what it gets wrong ruins the whole package.Pros:- Out-of-the-box graphics are terrible, no team licenses, etc. All this is easily fixed with patches. I recommend PTE Patch. I honestly don't know why Konami wastes money on licensing. All of that content is provided by the community.- Dribbling is pretty OK, I guess.Cons:- You don't get to play the game. If you like games like Final Fantasy, where you put one finger up your nose, and then chose moves from a menu, you'll like playing PES. It's a lot like that.- Passing is atrocious. This is what kills the game. There is NO, I repeat NO ACTUAL MANUAL passing mode. You CANNOT just kick the ♥♥♥♥ing ball and then run your player into it. Even if you make a good pass on full manual controls, the game will decide you suck, and don't DESERVE to make the pass, and your player will run away from the ball, away from where you are pressing the control stick and let the ball go to the opposition.- Defending is a crapshoot. You do not get to decide which player to control, you do not get to decide how the player you ARE ""controlling"" moves. You are too stupid to leave these decisions in your hands, so Konami does it for you. Dumb♥♥♥♥♥I've come to accept that a decent soccer sim will simply NEVER exist. Don't look for it, be happy with what you've got, which is a clunky, inelegant contrived POS."

76561198334624494,Recommended,456610,25884663,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,aymanfcbayern,"My honest review:Although I am a big fan of FC Bayern München and it's a huge loss that the team is completely unlicensed this year, but I would still say that Pes 2017 is the best football game that Konami has ever made since the days of ""winning eleven 3"" and ""Pes 6"" for many reasons: (taking into consideration that I only play offline exhibition matches)Note: before you start evaluating the game and make snap judgments you have to spend some time first playing it, as the more you play the game the more magic you will explore..1. Gameplay: smooth with zero lag, quick player reaction, less bugs than ever before, no random ball physics or silly player collisions, accurate passing system, improved ball crossing and lofted balls, beautiful through balls which can now be achieved from any area on the field, goalkeepers quick reaction with new impressive animations, adaptive AI makes gameplay against CPU much more interesting and creative, Referee decisions are more accurate and strict, improved free kicks and new corner kick strategies2. Graphics: player models and motions look identically the same as in PS4 with minor differences in texture, The turf color looks greener and better than last year (only in day time matches), New beautiful net shapes and edit options, Animated stadium staff, Kits colors look more authentic and less cartoonish than last year, menus move smoother with a pleasant look.3. Sound effects: minor enhancements like the nets when hit by the ball or when the ball deflected off the goalie's gloves, minor enhancements in crowd chants, improved referee whistle.The major differences between PC version and 8th generation consoles version:As the Pc Pes 2017 is a hybrid version of 2 different platforms the following graphic elements are not available for pc gamers which is kind of disappointing:1. Weather effects: rain splash, wet grass and wet goal nets, breath vapor of the players in cold weather.2. high quality turf texture.3. Lifelike crowd texture.4. As many stadiums as the console versions.5. Referee vanishing spray.6. Motion of the players uniforms.7. Realistic night lightening.8. Digital animated adboards.9. External stadium view.10. New special celebration.However, As PC gamers we are so grateful that Pes 2017 runs smoothly on almost every modern or mid-age PC unlike other football games which require massive hardware abilities and yet gameplay is still laggy, moreover PC users can run the game at maximum graphic settings and the game will look even better than how it looks on 8th generation consoles,Therefore if you want to enjoy gameplay at the maximum graphic settings without having to worry about frame rate and laggy motion which spoil gameplay I recommend running the game at 1280x720 resolution only.Not forgetting that we have enough space to freely create and modify our teams on PC, Overall, PC game is worth it if we compare it to it's low price, as If you enjoy how football played on the pitch Pes 2017 is definitely the game of your choice, and if you enjoy how football looks on TV go for another game."

Still, I feel like the 2014, 2015 versions were better (and let's not talk about other titles).This game, hasn't improved much in graphics and sounds. Has improved in menus, team organization, update system (but still very annoying to wait minutes for the game to start sometimes when the internet connection is not reliable), IA (and there are many disturbing moments where the players just don't want to get the ball) and player movement.The ""Become a Legend"" and ""Master League"" modes have received some modifications, appearing to have less things then previous versions and to be more scripted than never. Just not so amazing as it used to be.So, between positive and negative things, the game is still losing his magic.

The AI is so garbage I feel the need to question whether or not the designer have ever played football. Your team struggles to maintain formation integrity. Man marking is a joke. No Zone control or defense  and everything is basically forced to let the player make up for the lack-of.I don't know why there is such an elaborate tactical design on formation and squad control, when it NEVER is applied in an actual match.Referee's are completely ♥♥♥♥ing dense and are always biased in favor of the AI, (because how else will it make up for how ♥♥♥♥ing easy it is to win the ball). Apparently so long as you make a sliding tackle it really doesn't matter if your attempt to win the ball (before making any contact with the player) is successful or not.so long as your an offensive player, the game will always look at it from a leaniant perspective that a defending player should be allowed to make moves like that, but a centre forward gets red carded on a sliding tackle where he won the ball and did not make any harsh contact with the player, slid from the side, TRAPPED THE BALL and was red carded.The design is obviously biased to suggest that a CF should not be allowed to make tackles on defenders because, if play continued... it's an easy attempt at goal. Apparently nobody likes a football game when its very easy.Goal Keeper control is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and is always slow reaction based.Unless you directly assume control of the goal keeper, he'll never do anything intelligent until he has to react. I.e. shot on goal, passed directly too keeper etcLoose balls, Narrow corner kicks and sometimes last man runs, Goal keepers are inclined to stay on their line.There's no AI based attitude to get a desired effect where the goal keeper will make their own decision.BUT HEY! LET'S REDESIGN THE FLIP FLAP... BECAUSE EVERYBODY LIKES AWESOME DRIBBLING SKILLSTo conclude, this game faulters where every top tier football game does. And fails to see the bigger picture.There's a lot more to a football game than a ♥♥♥♥ing retard who can dribble well, however Konami seem to like to add mechanics of dynamic dribbling, and discard functions such as, on the ball player command/interaction. I mean I can't even ♥♥♥♥ing direct somebody to make a run, and ironically enough they never do it themselves.I mean, have the developers of the game even looked at their own ♥♥♥♥ing game? Play the game, play the ♥♥♥♥ing game PLEASE, take possession of the ball, and dribble for a while. Now, watch your midfield. Watch them, just watch them.THEY'RE DOING NOTHING.Do you not realize that mid fielders and defenders still have active roles EVEN WHEN YOU'RE IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL?Do you not think that holding the D-Line in an aggressive scenario is still maintained even when you have possession of the ball?Do you not think that the team should MAINTAIN FORMATION at times?You cannot seriously think factors like zone control and formation integrity is maintained only when you don't have possession of the ball.Mid fielders never cut off space, or control open zones. I mean, it's like you think Zone defense is something completely different. I just don't understand.Please, learn football before you make a football game.And fix your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Ronaldhino syndrome!"

Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 is a series of game that developed for many years, but it is still far away from calling a Soccer game. It is not simply changing the interface, the layout of the contents, the background colour, but is to keep upgrading the engine until it playing like a REAL soccer game. And, after several years of development, what is in this game? I can say nothing.First, the camera views provide many choices but none of the camera meet the standard or suit the game; especially when I am playing Be a Legend mode. In this mode, I just control 1 player, but the camera always loss of control, it followed the ball without sense, my player is showed somewhere at the bottom of the pitch, the icon in the radar is not clear, I don't really know how to go back to my position. Next, the camera is following my player, but it does not turn the angle to follow my player, when I change in direction in a suddent, the camera may sometimes fade out. Then, the camera along the sideline giving a better view of the whole pitch, but it makes me hard to control my player, especially the he is running along the sideline far from the camera, player becomes too small. Can I have a camera that placed behind the goal, at high level, which gives a wider view of the pitch?OK ! Let's move to the gameplay. I am playing Central Midfield, and I keep lossing the ball in the midfield; poor first touch, unlawful tackle, strong muscle...etc. which always result in 2-5 players falling on the floor and fighting for the ball. It is unbelievable !! I don't know why the A.I. team can tackle my ball easily, YES ! I am playing ""professional"" level, but it cannot be such easy, right? The A.I. team just simply crazy !! Deadly tackle (in any situation) and deadly through ball (my defender simply let the A.I. player gets the ball in front of his face). These TWO major bugs really destory the game !Next, my player has been sent off for many time. Got yellow cards for a easy tackle, sometimes red cards for sliding tackle....but the A.I. team, when he did the same against my team, is not foul at all !!!How could you publish such a rubbish gameplay engine? I used 8 hours to play nearly 1 season in Be a Legend mode, and I think it is enough !! Don't wanna play such rubbish game anymore !!!"

This is the first time I have gotten it for myself.My god is this a bad sports game!  It might possibly be very fun, but I have no idea how to do anything!  I have done every training, watched tons of youtube videos, and played several seasons of master league...but I still don't understand how to do the most basic of things: win a header, shoot towards the goal, have my teammates NOT run away from a pass.  It's insanely frustrating.  I've fiddled with every menu, every setting, and tried every tactic, but if I play as Real Madrid vs the English 3rd division I am forced to watch Ronaldo get outpaced by Sunday league defenders while chasing a through ball, Modric get run over from behind and stripped of the ball whilst trying to process the ""pass button"" command that has stymied the great thinkers of our time, and seen my hapless goalkeeper stand by aimlessly as braindead midfielders rocket screaming dippers into the far corner from 50 yards out.Im 60 hours in at this point and I give up.  I want to be clear that I bought this game specifically for the offline gameplay.  I don't care about the graphics, the menus and layout don't matter to me, I almost never play online, I just wanted to play a ""realistic"" football game.  This is not that.  This game is very *complicated*, but it's just not football.This seems like it might be a good game for someone who is a long time player of WEPES.  For a relative newcomer, it makes slamming my head into a pile of bricks sound like an enjoyable afternoon."

Players who do not control the ball? Players who dive in every contact? Games stopped by fouls all the time?Since when that players from big clubs are the only capable of scoring goals? While players from small clubs are unable to beat a goalkeeper in 1x1, it reminds me of the commercial view of FIFA.I'm sad to revisit a game that I played so much and see that they have lost the feeling of football (soccer) simulators."

Practically does not differ from the previous parts in terms of new opportunities. I think you should bring something new into the game and remake the ""become a legend"" mode. Make opportunity to spend on anything a salary: for example, if the player was injured, then for treatment, etc. I often play for the goalkeeper and I want to say that the control is very bad. Do so that a player jumps not only when the ball is flying into it, but with each press of the buttons. Need the statistics of the missed goals, need the official names of all teams. We need all the leagues and do not forget about Russian and Ukrainian clubs. I think for such a cost of the game developers should do all the clubs and leagues, but not users. Sorry for my bad english. I hope developers will read it. Thank you :) I did not put on a negative review, because I like konami and I want a good PES."

The FIFA series never truly got my juices flowing in the past, although many consider it to be superior to PES. Personally, I always felt that PES does a much better job at conveying the flow and atmosphere of a football game, hammering home the ""feel"" of the game in a way that FIFA never really used to do.Reading the comments here, I probably should have known better... But I took a chance on PES 2017. I needed some football, and I have to say PES 2017 has delivered for me. My old rig can't even play it on full screen at the highest resolution, but I'm managing quite well and having a good time.- If licensing is a big thing for you, PES is not what you're looking for.- PES is not exactly the best PC port.- PES controls take a bit getting used to- Editor options could be a bit more broad- Replays are a bit clunky, camera points not the best- Camera takes some getting used to at first, in conjuction with the controls- Online play supposedly sucks, but I haven't tried and it is not that important to me personally.+ Stadium sounds are pretty good, can definitely add to the feel of the game.+ Flow of the game feels quite organic - I've always felt this way about PES vs FIFA and this is no different.+ PES in general feels like a football game rather than a game about football.+ Editor gives you some options concerning teams, possibility to set up your own teams, leagues, cups.+ Different game modes, some of which are quite interestingAll in all, I'd say you need to be aware of what you're getting. If you're familiar with PES and used to like it, this seems a safe choice to me. I think 20 bucks is a good price for what you're getting - but as is evident by the other reviews, not everyone agrees."

76561198338287175,Recommended,456610,31167042,Posted: 15 April,all,feldomingues,"Em português(brasileiro) / In brazilian portuguese:Jogo divertido mas que poderia ser melhor.Em primeiro lugar, os gráficos são da velha geração e o gramado é um tapete liso de textura borrada, pra mim que joga no Medium numa GPU Radeon HD 7650m rodando a 60 fps(você precisa rodar a 60 fps senão o jogo fica travando). Já chegou a hora da konami equivaler os gráficos e o jogo a nova geração sem distinção. E pretendo pegar um novo PC para rodar.Jogo na dificuldade normal e que com o passar do tempo ficou muito fácil e jogar no próximo nível, o Profissional já é bem mais desafiante e por vezes frustrante, especialmente no modo Rumo ao estrelato. Deveria haver um modo de dificuldade meio-termo entre os dois.Um dos modos mais divertidos e que não existe no Fifa é o Rumo ao estrelato onde você vive a vida futebolística desde o início de um jogador de futebol e controla somente ele em campo com visão de terceira pessoa vertical, como se estivesse dentro do campo. Uma pena que faltam tantas licenças e instalar patchs dizem que dificulta os jogos online.Jogar de dois ou mais jogadores locais com amigos é uma das opções mais divertidas, com diversas opções de copas e ligas diferentes, jogando cada um em seu time ou todos os jogadores no mesmo time.Pra jogar você precisa ter internet, não adianta colocar o steam no modo offline, uma baita sacanagem.Se você quer saber se prefere Pes ou Fifa baixe a demo dos dois. Aquele modo estória do Fifa é muito sem noção mesmo. E já está na hora do Fifa adicionar um modo similar ao Rumo ao estrelato.De qualquer forma, foram inúmeras horas de pura diversão pra mim que não jogava PES já a alguns anos e que sempre o preferiu em relação a Fifa. Mas se a Konami não fizer o próximo jogo com gráficos de próxima geração e mudanças significativas, mesmo porque esse jogo anual é bem caro, não pretendo comprar a próxima versão e olharei com carinho o próximo Fifa.In english:Funny game that could be better.First, the graphics are old generation and the pitch/grass is a blurred  pack of textures, like a green smooth carpet. I play on medium at 60 fps in a GPU Radeon HD 7650m(you need to run at 60 fps else the game gets sluggish). It's time for konami to equalize the graphics and the game with the new-gen without distinction. Also I pretend to get a new PC to run it.I play on normal difficulty wich has become very easy and playing at the next level, Professional, is quite harder and sometimes frustrating especially in Become a Legend mode(BAL). There should be a medium-term difficulty between the two.One of the funniest modes that doesn't exist in Fifa is Become a Legend where you live the life of a single soccer player since the beginning and controls only him on the field with vertical third-person view. It's a pity it misses so many licenses and they say installing patchs makes playing online harder.Playing with two or more players locally with friends is one of the funniest options, with several options of Cups and Leagues, playing each one in it's own team or all the players in the same team.To play you need internet, it doesn't work putting steam on offline mode, a big let down.If you want to know whether you prefer Pes or Fifa download both demos. That story mode on Fifa is really nonsense. And it's about time Fifa adds a similar mode to BAL.Anyway, I had several hours of pure joy for me that haven't played PES for a few years and that always prefered it over Fifa. But if Konami doesn't make the next game new-gen and with substantial changes, even bacause this is expensive and anually, I probably won't be buying it and will look closely to Fifa."

76561198078938514,Recommended,456610,30777509,Posted: 27 March,all,LiquidKameleon,"PES 2017 is hands down the best football game ever made, and that is why I bought it.If you've been playing football games as long as I have, whether it was FIFA or ISS/WE/PES, you have, no doubt already encountered cases where the sequels of these gigantic franchises disappointed you somehow. Especially lately I find it being a recurring theme in this genre. One year you applaud the current installment for having a great set of animations, a great dribbling feel, a precise passing system that lets you play the ball exactly as you intended, a good balance between the attackers and defenders, shooting system and keepers, and so on. Only to find that the next year brings a completely different story: the keepers suddenly leak like an old bucket, the defenders fail to cover, the through passes become uncatchable, too many goals are scored during the match... You know how it goes. So then you patiently await the trailer for the next installment to see if they're gonna see where the problem was and address it this year, but all you see is fancy names for new technologies that are supposedly improving the game beyond recognition (seriously, how many times were we promised a ""player ID"" system?), but are not  actually changing the gameplay elements that  matter that were kinda ruined the last time.This is why the latest PES is the monument for the genre. What they did was take the decent PES 2016 and tweak it adding improvements where they were much needed and balancing it out to make a better and improved game with the new iteration. Yes, it is silly that this is something monumental that we have to applaud, while it should be common sense, but that's where we are right now.And the result is brilliant. The gameplay allows you to play as you wish, creating chances in all ways known in the football world with no emphasis on any one of them. The defenders are drastically different and immensely more capable of stopping attacks, their well timed and solid tackles are uncomparable to the flimsy and unprecise attempts from midfielders and defenders to take the ball. Goalies are perfect, no more clumsiness and sloppy reactions and gifted goals as a result. The dribbling feel is excellent and direct, the feints are usable if you know how to perform them, and the aerial battles are realistic enough for punting the ball long forward to your tall target men to become a valid tactic. The AI is incredibly smart and will sometimes feel like a live player. You can't just repeat the same moves and passing patterns, because the CPU player will learn to anticipate it and stop it.What's really lacking is the Master League which is promising, but hasn't improved much since last year. Unlike FIFA, players will never stubbornly fight for a bigger paycheck as they become valuable, they won't be picky about the clubs they join, they won't complain if you don't give them enough play time, or just request a transfer because they feel like it. In PES ML they feel like cattle that just does as they're told as you buy them. This makes ML a lot less challenging than it could have been. Not to mention the lack of licenses, a limited but good soundtrack, etc.Right now, PES 2017 is the Richard Burns Rally of the football game world. Weaker presentation, a lack of official licenses and content, not well developed game modes, but in the middle of it lies an absolute gem of a wonderful gameplay that makes everything else irrelevant. And that's beautiful, because that's the essence of a video game, a foundation that must be well built before you can add anything on top of it. The game that focuses on gameplay first and fills the other gaps later is always the best. Like GTA did by making driving and shooting enjoyable before anything else and built around it, while it's competitors consistently failed by trying to fill the game with different content and neglecting it's core."

,Recommended,456610,34327373,Posted: 18 August,all,a.stent,"I have waited for a while to write a review as (for me) the initial learning curve was steep and it is hard to judge a game until you learn to play it well. For anyone scoffing at my ""learning curve"" statement, my issues are entirely down to using a controller. Although this is an absolutely brilliant single-player game, I have previously only played PES on the Wii and, although inferior in every other way to the PC version, the Wii control system simply cannot be matched with a controller. Even now, after 57 hours of play, I still regularly hit the wrong button and will probably never even attempt some of the flashier moves. However, I absolutely love (and hate!) this game and would recommend it to any games player who also likes football.A common gripe for many is the lack of real teams. This was solved for me by using the PES Smokes patch (I just typed into Google). I installed this immediately before playing the game so cannot make comparisons (apparently graphics are improved), but the teams all seem correct and properly named. The English Premier League even includes Huddersfield and Brighton.Another common gripe is multiplayer. I only intend to play single-player so, for me, this game is excellent value for money. However, ""could not log on"" is a common opening message. I bought this game for half the current price in the Steam sale and am clearly going to enjoy many hours of single-player gaming, making it an excellent buy.I have not yet tried everything. ""MyClub"" has not been tried and ""Become a Legend"" has only been played a little. There are lots of other modes. The attraction for me is the MasterLeague. It is absolutely brilliant to play. It perfectly simulates the love/hate feeling of supporting a team. Sometimes my team are on form and everything is wonderful with slick flowing moves and excellent goals, but then other times the forwards could not hit a barn door and passes are so inaccurate that I actually have to check that I am not holding the controller upside-down! Playing on Regular level (i.e. easy enough for a partial learner) I started with a lot of 0-0 draws (the Tottenham defenders are really good, just like the real team) but soon picked up. I got to the last game of the season needing just a win to be League Champions - my team hit the woodwork twice, dominated play and got caught on the break for a 2-2 draw and second place in the League behind Liverpool. The next game was the Champions League final against Bayern Munich - utter domination, three(!!) disallowed goals, more woodwork, a last minute equaliser and then lost on penalties (Germans!). The misery of real life simulated to perfection.The MasterLeague also has a transfer system, players improving (or getting worse), individual form changes and pretty well anything else you might expect from a real football season. Utterly brilliant (in single-player mode)."

Fifa can have its licenses, better graphics, and whatever else there is, but they cannot (yet) simulate soccer the way Pro Evolution can.This year’s PES 2017 has surprised me positively.

Gameplay has improved a lot and it is realistic, though there may be minor bugs, which I hope they improve. Goalies have also improved a lot. Now, the behave as such. Defences are tough and they are not easy to beat, which is great. Now, the ""superstar"" level is worth its name. The game is really funny and challenging. Besides, the way you command players and their movementes, either attacking or defending, has also improved big time. It also feels realistic.Graphics, as we all know, are poor yet they can be improved by using mods. As regards animations, they are, mainly, the same we had last year. There was not an improvement in this respect, at least in the PC version.Again, licenses are poor yet we can fix that issue, too.If KONAMI are going to fight against piracy, which is correct, they MUST treat PC users as we deserve as we have paid for the game.For that reason, I hope to get updates and bugs corrections as well as new faces and DCLs weekly.To sum up, if I focus just on the gameplay, I have to say that it is the best football game I've ever played.Cheers."

,Recommended,456610,25503367,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,takuu ´ urkki,"As you could have already predicted, graphics-wise, it's on the same level as PES 2016 PC version, in a matter of fact, it looks nearly identical - subpar compared to the 8th generation consoles. The most unfortunate part about this is that the spectators look like pixelated demon spawn clones from hell. What seems to be improved though is the player models and faces, which I think are on the same level as the console versions. What PS4 and XB1 copies have to offer are better lighting, shadows, post-processing effects such as model tracking motion blur, HDR etc. - pretty much everything graphics related. This PC version seems to have none of them. Thanks Konami. What an absolutely chivalrous way to please your paying PC customers.Now to the part why I still decided to recommend this game; you probably guessed it: GAMEPLAY. On all areas the gameplay is so much more fluid, responsive and overall better compared to PES 2016. Animations, especially goalkeeper animations are greatly improved. And the best part is passing play: short passes, long passes, low lobs, chips, everything works so well and natural. Collision detection is improved, and now the referee actually reacts to fouls like he should. Really great stuff, it does feel like a proper simulation of football. I kinda feel obliged to not recommend the game, but this is all we have for the newest, most accurate football simulator of now for the PC (not talking about you, FIFA 17). One big minus is the lacking team licenses, but I'm keen on waiting for modifications, which I'm quite sure will be on the making as soon as possible.All in all: If you are a big PES gameplay fan, and don't mind to spend the full price, buy it. If you aren't much a fan of PES, own either XB1 or PS4, prefer FIFA, are tired of Konami taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥on PC only players in the graphics department: don't buy it.

For the lack of licenses, fake names,kits etc once patches start rolling out, the advantage FIFA17 held over licenses would be irrelevant.

The scripting in this game is mad, Teamates making the worst decison in terms of pass, movement and when to dribble. While the AI makes perfect pass and dribbles. The funny thing is, my team is far better than thiers. How can someone like hazard  not be able to dribble one player, yet someone I haven't even heard of in the AI team is dribbling 3 players (including me) on the wing???To be fair, PES was a fun game and an alternative to Fifa, as the offline mode in Fifa is horrible. However, in recent years, they are getting too caught up in chasing the competiton in terms of online mode etc, instead of being honest with themselves and focusing on making the game the best it can be."

The game itself is literally just the Xbox 360 port, except that it pretends that your keyboard is a controller (literally the way you set up the controls is by corresponding keys on your keyboard to a part of an xbox controller). The game is lacking in many major leagues and teams, making it's customizability very important, which is one of the only redeeming features of the game. I am getting a refund and so should you. Use the Steam sale as an oppurtunity to buy from a developer that actually cares about PC gaming."
