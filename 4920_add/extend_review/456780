Things to note+Pros>Large selection of bikes>Beautiful courses>Fantastic physics>Great history+Cons>Somewhat choppy(Framerate issue, it might be just me but if not i'm sure this will be fixed soon)>Character models (lacking diversity in clothes,faces and everything in between)And that is it fantastic game for any Ducati and bike racing fan alike, offers extensive history on Ducati and a rich selection to choose from. solid 8.5/10"

(Ïf you don't like Ducatis there is no point, maybe) The historic bikes sound good, look good... and vibrate :-DTracks are also polished a bit.""Historical"" Milestone ""style"": Interface is basic: you have no time to read text about the bike on loading screen (SSD drive here... not a console :-)All oponents have same number plate and dress the same..Online is same basic amateur interface. Why not use Steam/Halflife interface?But again: it is great fun and instructional once the flag goes down :-)PD: I wonder if ""Wales"" track is somehow realistic. ""Stelvio"" (been there trice) is a pastiche, and it is in ITALIA. A shame!Historical tracks like old Assen, old Le Mans, Monjuich etc would be EPIC!"

Even though it is essentially just a standalone expansion of RIDE, performance is horribly bad and stutters a lot, even on computers that used to play RIDE perfectly well.Audio is dead silent, no soundtracks during races. Bikes not exactly modeled the best.To see more about what the game actually looks like you can refer to my review video here :https://youtu.be/yUlMZnc9zLA"
,Recommended,456780,31561123,Posted: 5 May,all,VithiA,"Well, for 2€ there's nothing much too say about the game.It clearly RIDE (same pros almost same cons) but for this price, defaults are quickly forgotten :rude and linear IA,""solo/career"" mode have 0 personnality,lack of customisation (riders gears, motocycles, ect ...).But it's only 2€ so ... for this price you have a Moto Racing game with cool feeling with xbox controller, a good gameplay (special mention when you Disable assists and start picking the curves like a BOSS !),sounds is ok but a bit uneven from one motocyle to another (some olds one sounds like weird, it's like a race with only mower.).Graphisme are ok, motocycles are well modeled but the long range environement looks outdated.Anyway, like i said at this price you can ride on without a doubt.PS: And god ! This game remind me at what point i miss to drive on Magny-cours <3"

I have an enterprise laptop on which newer more complex games run better than this.Riding by myself is ok, but going on races with 20+ AI just makes the system stall.Looking forward to playing it more when I get a better PC."
76561197970655201,Recommended,456780,24810443,"Posted: 10 August, 2016",all,Artie-Choke,"As the owner of a 2015 Ducati Monster that I ride HARD (10k miles in the last year), this sim was of particular interest to me.  I put it off until it hit -40% on sale though.  Certainly worth it at this price.Track and bike physics seem to be very good with lots of options.  Coming off Grand Theft Auto 5 where the bikes have fantastic (if unrealistic) handling, I was a bit surprised when a bike would actually slide out from under me when taking a corner too fast (as it should!).It's a real treat to race these historic bikes from the 50's on up to modern times.  The bikes seem to be modeled very accurately too.  Nice how they each get their own history synopsis.I love how the old bikes handle as you would expect.  Not being able to take a corner like a newer bike does is frustrating but very real.  I'm very excited to work my way through all these great bikes and finally take the one I own out on those tracks.One gripe is that the bikes do not feel very 'planted' on the track - visually.  They almost seem to float an inch above the ground.  Partially because the bikes do not seem to pivot side-to-side on the bottom radius of the tires (as you lean), but look to pivot at about a distance half way up to the axle - giving it a kind of pendulum swing as you lean the bike.  A bit distracting when in third person.  I chalk it up to the age and limitation of the engine.The other gripe is that all the bikes in a race look exactly like the one you're on.  All the riders look exactly like you look.  Would it have been too much trouble to mix up the colors and outfits a bit?Most of the review complaints here are based on this being more of a DLC to Ride than a stand-alone game.  A legitimate issue, but you don't have to buy it, so don't down vote the game because you think you should have gotten this as a free DLC.Wrap-up: You're never going to get a realistic feeling from a racing sim on a console or PC as compared to the bike I hop on every day, but for the money, I have no real complaints here and it's a thrill to ride all the historic Ducatis.  If you like to race or ride hard and love Ducatis, definitely grab this (especially when on sale)."
76561198064388679,Recommended,456780,29043428,Posted: 5 January,all,ZenZone1,"Feels unfinished; the first race in Historic Tour, all the bikes and riders look exactly the same right down to the racing number, suit and helmet. It's a clone race as you can see from some of the trailers and screenshots in the store page. Tutorial also lacking in voice over which is present in previous Milestone racing titles. No wow factor intro video either. All signs of unfinished work or budget or time constraints.https://youtu.be/7gSW-L1Mu4MGraphics wise looks good and plays smoothly even though my laptop doesn't meet the minimum spec. Music is as cool as in Ride just different which is good. Ride has better content and its replays are more interesting to watch than clone races.https://youtu.be/9vHfcIQNgKYOnly get when discounted 'coz it's non-essential; just a niche collection of bikes for fans, collectors or history buffs. Recommended only for bike fans or those who prefer a mix of street and track races. 6/10Why in the world do we have clone races? If this was real how to determine who is in what bike? GPS and RFID? These sort of clone races are also present in Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends but not all of them are clone races. I suppose it's the same here too. It's just so bland to watch, quite underwhelming actually. The worst aspect of it; all the same numbers. At least make the numbers different. Look at Project CARS Pagani Edition; different models different liveries and it's free!https://youtu.be/tdnT808kTaIIn DUCATI 90th Anniversary you get mostly quantity over quality. Yep 6/10 only, mediocre effort.Still recommended though 'coz it's the only one with antique models."

( you cant change gear helmets designs and so on like Ride)Apart from that the title run fine looks good ( MAX SETTINGS) handles fine so same ol from these Developers.Think of it as a stand alone addon for Ride and you set still good value, pick it up on sale as i did"

76561198005755324,Recommended,456780,24798809,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,Mr. Tex,"More or less an expansion of the original Ride game, if you enjoyed the first game you'll enjoy this one too. You get 39 bikes, 10 or so of them also appear in the original Ride game, so veterans get around 29 truly new bikes. In terms of DLCs and Expansions for racing games, getting 29 new bikes for €20 is a very good deal.The main reason to get this new game is for all the Ducati bikes, designed in detail and with unique sound and handling. The tracks are taken from the main Ride game, so nothing new on this front. The AI is really good and the game runs well on my PC.They have tweaked the user interface to be more efficient to use than in the orginal Ride game. You have a Career mode that will take you dozens of hours to get through. It is a very challenging game, where you need to learn the tracks and adjust your bike's settings if you race on Medium and above.My only complaint about the game is the same as with the Ride game; I wish the physics was more sim-like, closer to Milestone's MotoGP and SBK games. It would have added another dimension to the game.If you are a fan of Ducati or a true fan of bike games in general, this is a fun game to play."
