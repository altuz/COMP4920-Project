It's a zombie centipede 'snake' puzzle game of traversing labyrinths the optimal way, basically the clone of 'Millie' game by the same devs. It's intended for gamepad play but you can use keyboard as well. The problem resides in those controls department - I had a really hard time trying to push buttons in time to turn precisely where I wanted to, so the goal of the game and the thinking part start to kinda vanish behind this struggle - the damn zombillie wouldn't give you one spare moment before she bumps herself in the♥♥♥♥♥♥for gameover, and the buttons are either too unresponsive, or that's me who couldn't seem to concentrate enough (excuse me, I inconsiderately wanted to have some fun here).Несмотря на милый вид и неплохо проработанную проверенную временем идею, я не стану рекомендовать, так как вы можете расстроить свои нервы на почве данной игры без особых на то причин. Это головоломка ""змейка"" про сороконожку-зомби, которую следует провести оптимальными путями по лабиринтам, в общем клон игры ""Милли"" от тех же разрабов. Задумана для джойстика, но можно управлять с клавиатуры. Проблема лежит как раз в области управления - у меня возникли серьезные проблемы с тем, чтобы вовремя нажимать на кнопки и сворачивать туда, куда хочется, так что цель игры и мыслительная часть как бы уходят на задний план - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ая зомбиножка не даст вам лишнего мгновения перед тем как врезаться себе в ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ и проиграть, а кнопки такие неотзывчивые... то ли это я не сконцентрировался должным образом (ну простите, я всего лишь хотел развлечься)."
,Recommended,456810,28978585,Posted: 3 January,all,Gamephasis,"INTRODUCTIONZombillie is one of the cheaper titles that I purchased during the 2016/17 Steam Winter sale. I have enjoyed several of Forever Entertainment S.A.’s games in the past. Among these are the Teddy Floppy Ear games and the Frederic music titles. Although these games never feature tremendously high production value they are generally lower-priced indie games that are high on entertainment. Therefore, I was hoping for a title that would be something a little more than just a trading card idle game.HOPESHaving previously played Millie, another of Forever Entertainment’s games, I knew to expect a combination of the classics Snake, Centipede and other casual arcade games. Only this time the game had been skinned with the overdone and outplayed zombie stylings.Therefore, I had somewhat basic hopes for Zombillie before playing. I anticipated a simple, well-designed puzzler with smooth controls and challenging gameplay. I suspected that the game would be able to hold my attention for about an hour while I went on an achievement hunt.IMPRESSIONSGAMEPLAYUnfortunately, the expectations that I held for the gameplay failed to materialize to the level that I had hoped. Although the game has been designed for full controller support keyboard play is also enabled. Having spent time with both I found the keyboard the better of the two options. However, both have similar issues. I found that inputs weren’t as responsive as what I would have liked. This was more glaring when using my Xbox One controller than it was in using the keyboard but neither solution was quite satisfactory.The problem with this issue is that the game requires accurate input to be played at its maximum effectiveness. Having read through other reviews and discussions on the game I have found this to be a relatively common complaint. Therefore, this issue tends to take away from the overall gaming experience.I found the queues at the beginning of each levels a little too easy to skip. This information is important in educating the player with the necessary information at the beginning of each level. These do not repeat if you accidentally click through them by trying to restart the level. This was a minor source of aggravation.PRESENTATIONAs has been traditionally the case with Forever Entertainment’s games you’re looking at lower production values. The production values of the game are almost always most apparent in the presentation. Zombillie wouldn’t have looked out of place with games released a decade or more ago.Therefore, players can expect to find a simple presentation package in regards to both graphics and sound. These are passable for the game at hand, however, there is nothing within the entire presentation package that will be the least bit memorable after you complete the game. In fact, in a number of ways the presentation values of Zombillie really do nothing to persuade gamers to think any differently of cheap zombie skinned games.REDEEMING FEATURESI have levied more criticism upon the game than it arguably deserves. For the cost of the game, especially when purchased at the discount price that I paid for it ($0.49 at 90% off), you shouldn’t be expecting very much.There is a significant amount of content that will delight completionists.  There are almost 100 levels available to be played across 3 completely different environments and there are an additional 2 types of mini-games. This does keep the content relatively fresh and rewarding.The game contains a significant amount of content. There are almost 100 levels available to be played across 3 completely different environments and there are an additional 2 types of mini-games. Furthermore, there is an in-game store where players can cash in their in-game collectibles for bonuses and tools that will help you progress throughout the game.STEAM FEATURESForever Entertainment have always had a reasonable grasp on what their playerbase wants in a Steam game. There is a good set of five Steam trading cards along with 16 Steam achievements. The game utilizes the Steam cloud and leaderboard system and as mentioned previously also offers full controller support.In this respect, the way it utilizes the advantages of Steam’s available feature list is relatively impressive for a low tiered indie title. Such utilization does nothing but encourage players to purchase games when on sale and as such these practices are to be commended.VERDICTGiven the price that I paid for the game ($0.49 at 90% off) I’m not disappointed. The fact is that at this price point anything close to an hour’s worth of play is reasonable value. If you’re the type of gamer who purchases cheap trading card games to sell on the cards, you would have found the game to be a bargain at this price point.However, I would urge you not to purchase the game without it being on sale. The game really doesn’t have enough quality content nor smooth enough gameplay to justify a $4.99 price tag. I suspect that Forever Entertainment would understand this and given the regular discount intervals for the game may even agree. I would argue that games such as Zombillie are made especially for sales and bundles where any reasonable amount of income for the developer-publisher is a win-win situation.If you’re interested in cheap arcade puzzler’s and the game is on sale, then I would recommend a purchase. You’ll more than likely get your monies worth in this scenario.INTRODUCING GAMEPHASISGamephasisis a new gaming website featuring a talented globally based writing team.

This game is addicting, challenging and fun! If you like Pacman, Snake or even Centipede, puzzlers and nice graphics, get this game! The only complaint that I have is that the controls can be a little unresponsive, just like Millie,, other than that its a real fun little game."
,Recommended,456810,22919152,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,Gary Motherfucking Oak,"I got it about an hour ago and I love it. It's a puzzle game, and really long one too, much like the classic snake game, with extra stuff to increase the difficulty. It has a difficulty system that can change it up if you find it too easy (or too hard, you know...). There are twenty-four different floors in just the first level, out of three. The down side of it is that you have to collect a certain amount of hearts to go to the next floor or to the next level. This can make it a bit redundant, but, if you like puzzle games, you won't mind. The graphics are good and has it's own charm. I was impressed with everything this game has to offer and, again, I've only played it for about an hour.Now, the price is a little rough, unless you use hundred dollar bills to blow your nose, but not any worse than most Indie games(because, you know, they need to eat). I ,personally, had a coupon from making a badge for it and scrounged up the last buck twenty-five, but, if it's on sale, I'd recommend buying it."

You have to guide your ever growing worm thing through the maze without getting stuck.  So stopping and turning are essential.  But the game has a mind of its own.  You try to go forward once and turn left by clicking the arrow keys on your keyboard and instead the worm races forward several lengths running into itself ending the game.  I could almost deal with the teadiousness of it for the achievements and because it could perhaps be fun, but the achievements require the game to play flawlessly which it doesn't.  Check out how many actually have completed the achievements and you'll see a pattern.  I got it in a bundle.  I'm going to spend five minutes on the other game.  If it's not a complete winner I'm returning it.  Not worth full price.  Not worth it on sale for a fraction of that.  No help with game functioning on the forum."

You can play in different difficulties that grow your length at different speeds as you eat, and it just blocks the higher star rating & ""shoes"" collected that unlock new levels.  The game runs fine, controls are decent, and had no problems.  But in the end, I just didn't have much fun with it, so thumbs down.  (3/5 stars + trading cards)Millie is its predecessor, and is largely the same, but Zombillie has improved visuals (in my opinion)."

,Recommended,456810,35457400,Posted: 3 October,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Casual - Lemmings & SnakeTLDR: Pacman and Snake. Casual and Normal difficulties provide healthy relaxing twitch reaction gameplay with solid Xbox360 pad support and good and proper resolutions support. Controls felt responsive. Felt like it had a decent amount of levels and presented rather nicely. Liked it.This came two years after Millie. It features improved lighting, more visually engaging backgrounds. A less eye fatiguing color template. A halloween theme that fits centipede style creatures better and most importantly more responsive controls that do not ignore inputs from the controller. The concept to marry maze navigation, pellet gobbling and snake is interesting, and on the easy and normal levels, it provides a decent enough distraction for the mind and hands while keeping you rather hypnotized by the growing milliepede, the glowing orbs and the munching sound effect."
