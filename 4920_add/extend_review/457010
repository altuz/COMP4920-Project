,Recommended,457010,22380354,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,Trillnar,"Updated March 2017This game looks promising,  I will give it a thumbs up but i want to make a few things clear..Disabeling enemies is now possibleThe day / night cycle is too short (days are 12 minutes long and so are nights),You can not accomplish anything in that short amount of time. There is to much time spent on eating and drinking  and fighting off monsters you can not even see or hear at night until you are dead . And if you get caught in the spawn area with a zombie  you just die over and over and cant do anything about it.THe game requires you to stand in front of an anvil while you are making plates and you cant move or do anything else , A steel plate takes over 30 seconds.  IFood and water are spoiling too fast in your inventory ,  even if you build a freezer , they wont keep more then an hour or so. This needs to be rethought.I think the game shows promise And has come a long way.So now for the pros and cons.Pros1. great graphics2. The ability to create many things.3. Play with friends on a lan or over the internet.4. Hundreds of things can be built.5. The Sound is excellant.ConsZombies are too agressive.Day night cycle is too short.Working with the anvil is too time consumingHunger and thirst go down to fast.The game seems to generate a fairly small world even at its largest setting. Unless i am missing something the single landmass is the only landmass in the world.  (yes unity can create endless worlds if you program it to )Food spoils at too fast a rate , even if you place it in a freezer.Bottom line.I have a feeling that in time  the game will be a fun and exciting addition to your  library .According to the credits, the game states it was written by 1 person.It will probably take a long time before it is done. The price is right I am sure they will improve.I will update this review if things change.The game has come along  and  should be fine in the long term."

I'd just like to warn you that if (like me) you don't speak a word of Russian, this game is not for you.  Don't believe me?  Look at the Pinned threads, then go through pages of conversation all in the Russian script and find out for yourself.  The developer himself is replying in russian on the thread questions and there doesn't seem to be any real english translations to guide us english speaking community to understand what is going on with the thread.  Considering this is a Pinned thread, this enforces my statement further.  If I'd known I was going to buy a game that was not going to at least balance out the english language and give some of us an insight of wha'ts gonig on and being said, I would have swerved past this product.  As it is, I'm now stuck with it.I've given this game a fair 30+ hours of playtime so I should be able to make a relatively good base of a review on it.First and foremost, its not a bad game .  Don't let the Thumbs down actually deter people from actually purchasing the game.  I've done literally everything you can in game in regards to building what's currently available across two single player servers.The Pro's of the game* At the start, it is relatively slow to get yourself on your feet.  It took me around 2 realtime days to actually get some sort of broken battery power initiated to actually make any real progress.  Once you get a thermal generator up its smooth sailing for the most part.* You can make a fair few nice designs for base building.  The map can be varied to small, medium and big so you can get a lot of room to go places or keep the area small and managable.* The cross-server option is nice.  You make a fake world to mine resources and clear-cut the map to then bring over to your homeworld map (like Savage Lands where you can make a resource map - delete when cleared).* I do see a lot of potential if the game continues to go in this developing direction.----------------------------------------------------------------------Now the Cons - and sadly there's a lot more in these than the Pro's----------------------------------------------------------------------* Firstly, having aliens popping up ONLY at night (nearly always three and they randomly spawn whever they like) and die in three hits are tedious.  Technically any sort of barrier or even uneven surface they get stuck on and run at you where you can easily just kill them off.  They need a huge improvement with AI and spawning options.* A lot of the things you can build need to actually be operational and useful.   Currently, things like the Greenhouse, Filler and one or two other items constructed serve utterly no purpose.  They have not been scripted and are currently a construction waste of time as they do absolutely nothing at all.    These need to serve some sort of purpose.* My biggest headache - and a lot of the community agree - is that there is absolutely NO tooltips on items to be constructed.  I understand what machine (for example) does what by building and use it. (or I've had to refer to the discussions thread with other people asking those same questions).  The items are listed, it tells you what materials are needed to craft, however there's no description AT ALL as to what their purpose is.* The food side of things.  I am so fed up with just banana trees, oranges and lemons.  That's all I've found on EVERY world I've created and I've make hundreds of servers with different ratios for the resources sides.  but things like the Apple Trees, vegetables of ANY sort, etc etc... none of them exist.  I've never found any at all and really, I've solely been relying on oranges for the most part as a food source.  They decay in hand way too fast and the Freezer only slows it, so there's no real storage to keep them fresh.* Stuff needs to be described in regards to placement of structures.  I slapped down about 1500 blocks to be able to place the air transport factory as when I tried to place it on the map as its partially hilly, half of it was in a mountain or half underwater so I made a platform large enough (as its f'cking huge!) to place it on.  Total waste of time as it did not place on a flat structure.  This needs to be a possible option.  The Transport Factory has no problem being on a platform so why one and not the other?* Stuff like fishing, hunting that sort of thing would be good in game.  However, its currently not.. its a 3x tree farming simulator.* Some items are categorically useless.  The campfire purifies water 1x2 for the bottles.  When you upgrade to a Distiller, its 1x1, the process is a little slower, but you don't lose one bottle to every two.   Then there's the Chem Lab.  All its DOES is purify water and that's pretty much it.  Its the fastest of the three but what's the point of the middle man really?* Lastly, one other thing that has me a little concerned regarding the game that I read on Forum, I was trying to figure out the use of the Filler machine.  I have a vague idea but as its not doing what its supposed to do, I can't do anything with it.  I'm certain though that someone asked a question in regard to the Filler and the developer responded something like ""What is a Filler?""This actually concerns me as he was the one who put the object in and he himself doesn't know?   Two thirds of the forums are literally nothing but conversations in Russian which makes us english speaking only population at a loss unless we get a broken google translation decipher.   So it does raise my concerns regarding how ""user friendly"" its going to be.Please note, the main picture is of Space.  So Far I've found nothing that leads me into space and I'm not even certain if the games even developed that far.  The main picture on the Store page with the picture of Jupiter and one of its four main moons Europa.. that's the night sky spashscreen you see every night on your little chunk of island.  The bigger map may have fragments off shore, but it looks like there's no other islands off where you start.  I swam/walked for a solid 2 hours and saw nothing but ocean.  So I'm assuming its only the land you start on being the map itself.Personally I would wait to see how the game develops.  Its been enjoyable so far just to build bases and try and get some sort of power grid going.  Other than that, there's really nothing else to do.  So I'd suggest holding your money until it develops further."

I'll make it short because much of it has already been said.I'll add that the day night cycles suck.  Once it hits night you pretty much can't do anything because it's so dark.  Early in the game this means sitting around waiting for dawn.Also, you slowly die over time regardless of whether you eat/drink or not.  Not sure what's going on but it's just not fun at this point.  That's my two cents, buy at your own risk."

Unturned did that > For those saying that this may be some one man dev and that he may have a hard time.I liked the game on day one. But it ducking hasn't changed at all. It's still the same ducking experience you do. Having fun with 15 machines growing ducking bananas and you're done, no automation, no♥♥♥♥♥♥ Nothing whatsoever. Sure building is fun, go ducking buy minecraft okay?If there's one thing i hate it's when devs actually don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about people that enjoy their game. ""IllusoryWorldEntertainment"" Yeah, that's all in the name, Illusory updates, illusory bugfixes, illusory changes. It's all a ducking troll. This game shouldn't have ""Mostly Positive"" reviews, it should get a ton of sh*t in the face, because when these guys are actually getting unnoticed, some people actually struggle to make a game and are getting♥♥♥♥♥♥reviews.This shouldn't exist, this shouldn't be, Steam shouldn't let such guys sell products they don't even update. I mean sure it's 10$ or 6$ on sale, but after a year of developpement we're pretty much on day one developpement stage. Shame on them. So please everyone, don't buy this game, don't rate it positively, just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ until some update that's actually greater than 10mb comes out, with real content and not ducked up glitched content, where you get (rather try to get) to a dungeon and fall through the world and then your whole world is ducked and feels like you're in another dimension.I liked this game, i hoped it would've updated nicely even if it's kinda slow, i wouldn't have cared. I even thought to myself (on day one) that even if it looked a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥, i'm sure they'll get new mechanics in, new machines, planets, stuff to actually DO in the game without it ♥♥♥♥ing glitching on you. But guess what, if i'm writing this today, you can understand all that didn't happen. So please, just let StarsOne die.It's never gonna become anything, do not hope. The game is still a ""fun"" way to kill time if you don't pay for it, but yeah, you'll get 10-30 hours of gameplay like me and then you'll see how empty it is, and that the game never really changed in any way.Even with a multiplayer it would be empty since there's nothing to do besides farming and bulding, so if you want to build a map sized castle with a chest full of every type of ressources and 10km of banana trees then feel free to do it, but man, there's gotta be other games to do that same♥♥♥♥♥♥that are actually good.

The same day the developers responded and fixed the problem! If the devolopers keep this up I have no doubt in my mind they will become successful. I really hope they will add things like mining, maybe caves to explore and boats. The boats would be things like jetski, pontoon, and maybe cruise ships or submarines. I also hope they add underwater exploration and diving suits and harpoons, and enemies to be in the water. I wish they put in alien animals so we can use meat to help feed ourselves. The game itself is fun, my one complaint is  the heavy use of F1-F11, on mac thesebuttons dont work. At 7.99 (currently its on sale, normally 9.99) its a steal! great game! 9/10!

It does a good job of engaging the player in a bit of puzzle solving as to where to build, what to build and when. In the beginning it's important just to have a place to hide from the various critters.The game is still early in it's development. It seems to be a one or two man show at the moment. That being said, they have done a bang up job. It's a fun game that will have you wasting many a night building bases and machinery.The biggest down side is as of the writing, it is only a single player game.

Possible not, StarsOne seems to be a attempting to differentiate itself from its competitors by the range of building and progression through the crafting and if you see the screenshots you can see how advance you can go, but you do start of with building with wood and basic iron always up to modern electric items.Graphics of the game are competent nothing that is world changing but its good enough (without floating items you seem to get in random generate worlds). Only one area that needs work is shadowing on landscapes which especially one land seem to flick in and out of existence.Survival part of the game you need to keep health, hunger and thirst under wraps. The game has gone for a seed system for food, so as soon as you find one piece of fruit you can make trees to make more and more and more meaning this aspect of the game looks after itself. Water side of the game I had to deal with be building my base next to water and making bottles is very cheap and easy so you can care plenty of water around with you again not adding torment to the game which is not bad as the game seems to centre around crafting more then the survival.So why you not recommending?The core game play loop for me is just plain boring. I found very little need to go explore other then to find more ore for mining which seems to be about the only thing you cannot just keep building more off. The ore is just in the middle of fields you run up to it and hit it, I feel a sense of exploring to find items would help a sense of achievement to the game for me to keep me interested.It takes so long to turn ore to ingot (which can be left to do on its own) also even longer to use an anvil and turn ingot into usable parts all of which you just have to twiddle your thumbs.Can multi-player save the game?In its current state No, but I feel its the area that could ""save"" this game but the interaction between characters need to be made to offer great variety and allow people to build a world which they can almost rule, adding the human character aspects between players.If you just love collect and craft games give it a go for early access its better then most. Has the game done enough to separate itself from the market? If you just like simple building game then yes but for survival games it lacks compare to other choices.https://youtu.be/oqoDwOdFzI8"

Super Minor...- When the tree falls you can see through the bottom of the tree.- Getting surface ore is nice but it does not regenerate.  However, there is Iron veins.

The game is always being updated as well. Documentation for the game is lacking but most of it is self explanatory. The game also looks great and runs well (stable fps).

This game is very stable, and very straight foreward for something this early in development. I cannot wait to see what they add in the future, especially with the mention of trading, colonizing, and space travel in general.Full discloser though, I did spend about a quarter of my time so far just playing with the digger. So.....nine hours of good gameplay if you really want to rush things.If they continue to add to this game, and maybe make the guides and discussion threads a little easier to access for english speakers, this will be amazing, and you will be happy you spend ten dollars on it. But even if they don't, it's ten dollars for an actual working game, unlike other early access titles(It's less buggy than some AAA games at launch, and it's still VERY early access. That is a good sign.)"

The game has a great feel to it and atmosphere.Alot to craft/build/etc.  Love how u go from very basic materials, ore from the ground, etc to advanced cars and flying machines.Combat is ok as at the moment theres only 1 kind of ""alien zombie thing"" which is creepy and pops out of no where especialy in the dark.  U have to alway be aware of your surroundings, especialy at night.DEFINALY MUST HAVE GAME!I didnt know about this game until it was released and took a chance and bought it after just a quick glance at the description.

The tech progression makes sense and there are survival reasons to do things.  Graphics are decent without being overbearing.  Everything appears to function fairly smoothly.The one down note is that it is lonely while playing it.  Supposedly, it was intended to have multiplayer functionality, but that was removed last year.  I haven't noticed any news about multi coming back, so...if you want to play with friends, you are better off with one of the others, like Empyrion.That said, I still rate this game worth checking out, for the price."

Now for a game in the alpha stage, such as this one, I am very surprised at the stability of this game. It is not perfect, things pop up and still need to be done.Over all this is a great game with much potential. I love the building part of it. Creating things the way I want to. It is fairly simple but one does have to get use to the set up, which is not really difficult at all to figure out. There are some help documents that can get you going. The devs keep things updated, but this is still in the ALPHA stage. They are great devs but not gods, lol. I recommend this game even at this stage, which is very rare for me to do.

I had tired muting the audio to keep it from creeping me out as I played but it didn't help. I'm sure many of you who buy this game will not feel the same way, but this is why I am asking for a refund. Also, I am sure with it being early access this will be implimented later, but I would have enjoyed the story being in the game and not just something that I read on this site.Things I like about this game though...I enjoyed how easy it was to survive my first night. I have played games where once the sun goes down on the first day you may find you're doomed.There is little hand holding in crafting. I was making devices that I had no idea what they were used for and I was burning sticks because I didn't know coal was an option.Minimal villians. I know the natives would attack if they found me, but I never saw one in my two hours of play.The sense of adventure from the description was very alluring. I was so excited to build up a base and try to find all these missing friends. That's really what I had bought the game for.Things that could be added or improved.Character creation would be nice. Every time I open the menu there's this creepy looking man staring at me. He's part of the reason I don't want the game anymore.I find it strange that fruit from earth is growing on this planet.If I crashed in an escape pod I would anticipate a slightly different beginning.Anyways, I'd keep playing but it is unsettling to me.
