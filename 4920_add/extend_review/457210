We take turns running the levels. The controls are super tight, and the various powers you are given work well with speedrunning.Pros:+Really well designed title for a fairly niche audience+Controls are super tight, as they need to be for this kind of deal+The story is humorous enough and it definitely has it's own 'flavor'+Tons of content; if you are into speedrunning, this is a big playground+From my experience with early game content, the level design is great and feels fun to speedrunCons:-I hear that the level 'skin' and setting gets tiresome and doesn't change over the course of the game; I could see this becoming a drag after many hours-While I played on my gaming rig and low-end laptop and both worked well, there was some hiccups in the menus with the laptop; I've read from others that perhaps some optimization could be hadTry the demo.Great game, just go for it."
,Recommended,457210,24579897,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,dpi.erico [TF2 Odds Collector],"I barely ever play speedrunner games, because I want the game to have something special besides fast-paced gameplay, the 'X factor' if you will. SEUM has that special something. Here's why:The basic maneuverability is an element in all speedrunner games, but SEUM offers special powerups that completely change the way you have to move and position yourself across the map.The levels start out very straight forward, but soon you'll notice your best time is a lot slower than other people's. That's because the level design allows for different paths to be taken! The obvious choice is usually not the best compared to that hidden path you find after a dozen tries, and it's very satisfying to see your time decrease with each shortcut.That's another thing, you often HAVE to find the hidden paths to even come close to the target times! There's one easy to medium difficulty target time, and a hard one, in every level.Collectables! Yes indeed, there's a can of beer in every normal level, a couple bacon slices in the bonus levels, and let's leave the rest a surprise ;)Lastly, the overall satanic theme and heavy metal music fit really well with the speedrunner concept, and there's nothing like it at the time of writing this!Two thumbs up from me, 10/10, A+, you get the picture. NOW START RUNNING!!"
,Recommended,457210,31089481,Posted: 11 April,all,[J7] Dsp21 👻,"I wasn't aware of SEUM up until I had played its demo (now removed from the Store). In less than one hour, I was completely convinced that this game had immense potential, so I added it to my wishlist and waited for a sale. Six months later, here I am writing a review for it.SEUM is a first person platformer where you have to complete each level as fast as possible. Featuring a leaderboard system, you can track your times, your friend's and the worldwide records for every level. The scores are reset on every season, to make sure the top scores are fair without fixed exploits. It is technically an incentive to come back to it once in a while in case being on top is something you love.Running on the Unity engine, the game does not look spectacular or revolutionary but what matters is that it plays wonderfully. Controls are simple but tight, and movement feels perfect for the genre. All controls are rebindable in case you want to customize them. Graphical options are very limited which is disappointing, but you can adjust the FOV from about 60 to 140, which in my opinion is a crucial option in a game like this, despite the max value being a little too much!The first levels are fairly simple which mostly serve to introduce you to the mechanics, but the difficulty surely starts to increase on the third floor. With an impressive variety in level design and level variety, every level feels completely different from the others. That said, repetition doesn't feel frustrating in this game, it is the only way to learn and progressively get better. In total, there's about 150 levels on this game to be beaten, about 25 of them added in expansion packs (labeled as Extended Plays), completely free of charge! If you even want more levels, SEUM features Steam Workshop support and has a level editor to create your own demonic creations with ease! Within every level there are 2 different times to beat, and a beer hidden in it. Obviously, to get 100% completion all of this criteria is required. These beers do get very challenging to find on later levels! I have to admit the Steam discussions and guides surely gave me a hand. There's just tons of content in this game to discover and play through. About 10 secret levels, 12 bonus levels and 10 rituals to complete, which unlock 10 more secret levels.The music in this game despite being very short and limited, is great! The tracks are either rock or metal songs with no vocals, that will have you humming along while dying over and over again. At the time I did the Hardcore Speedrun, I had it turned off to listen to my own music, but bear in mind I had about 25 hours clocked in at this point. There's some great tunes in this title, definitely a game to NOT mute while playing!Five powerups may be present in the levels: Teleport, Anti-Gravity, Split, Spawn-Platform and the Booster. The last one is just a temporary speed boost so it's not like the others. You can have one powerup equipped at a time, and this means you have to plan your strategy on levels with various powerups. Bear in mind you spawn with no powerup, it must be picked up every time. There's definitely a learning curve in each of these powerups and it will take a while to master them.If the clock ticking on each level isn't enough for you, there's also an Endless Mode that randomly generates an infinite hall with traps with a deadly machine right behind you to make sure the player doesn't slow down. Run, Marty, run! And if the Endless Mode is still not enough, you also have a Speedrun mode where you can speedrun entire floors at a time... or even the whole bloody game from start to finish! Not to mention that there is an option to enable the Hardcore Speedrun mode in which you have to complete the whole game without dying. It was a tough and lengthy challenge, but completing felt overwhelmingly satisfying. Still not enough content to convince you? Well then... just go find the secrets and Easter eggs scattered around!It took me 35 hours to complete everything in the game, including the Hardcore Speedrun. Of those 35 hours, none of them were tedious, I cannot find a section of this game that I utterly hated or despised for being too hard, too frustrating or just boring... except Level 70 - Lamb of the Spit, of course. It is safe for me to say that SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is a formidably astonishing gem in the gaming industry. That said, it's completely worth getting it even at full price for it's excellent blend of platforming and fast paced action."

Like honestly I can't speed run nor does it sound fun."" well, you're wrong.I saw this game and instantly fell in love, speedrunning isn't a game genre itself, it was a community made thing which mostly aimed at older games as they were easy to break and complete. Then Pine Studio came in, making SEUM, a one of a kind game on steam, it doesn't compare to ""SpeedRunners"" as SEUM was targeted for proper speedrunning.GRAPHICSSEUM was made on Unity, I know a good looking and well made game running on the Unity engine.But the graphics are unique, they aren't some triple A, 12k sony textures. But they're good enough to satisfy any player,they're simple with 2 options which are resolution and graphics preset, the game doesn't include that FXAA blur effect but instead keeps it nice and clear so speedrunners can focus on the game rather than the graphics.It also has that old doom feel, it's set in hell with a heavy metal feel around it which sounds bad but honestly works out perfectly for this.SOUNDTRACKI usually don't talk about soundtracks in games as I mute them or turn them down, I always give them a try and none have satisfied me, but then SEUM came along with it's metal, I was ready to completely mute it before even giving it a chance, I'm happy I didn't though.Metal isn't a popular music genre, it isn't up there anymore like that cheeki breeki hardbass or pop, but should be.Pine Studio made an amazing soundtrack not only because it sounds great, but it motivates you to keep trying to beat your records, makes you feel badass and accomplished if you succeed.GAMEPLAYIt's a speedrunning game, you do need to be quick, the soundtrack like I said before goes well with gameplay, you need to be very focused on every single level and there's always alot of room for improvement making me always come back to this game, yes this is a speedrunning game so it may seem short, if you try to get 100% the game will possibly take 10-20 hours at max, but don't think of not buying it for being ""short"", this game has replayability to every aspect, getting better times for levels, new strategies, shortcuts!PLOTYou're chilling back as a ginger man named ""Marty"", have a beer in your hand, watching TV until Satan walks in and takes your beer, you're like ""♥♥♥♥ off m8 this is mine"" BUT THEN, OUT OF KNOWWHERE SATAN CUTS OFF YOUR WRIST, SO YOU CUT HIS OFF! He runs away with your precious beer but Marty didn't give up, he went into his secret basement and built a new hand with satan's hand, you go into hell with a badass fireball hand and fight through it , until you reach the end.ENDING AHEADYou're there at last, level 82... ""Beer Heaven"" , there's some clouds...they all were special though as they had beers all over them, Marty was literally in Heaven and never left...COMMUNITYOn steam the community seems inactive or dead, but when you get on the discord you'll find a humble and welcoming community, everyone sharing strategies, chilling out and talking with eachother, even theDEVELOPERSare in the official discord server and discuss about updates, ask for ideas and even implement them!SUMMARYThis game feels like it had alot of effort put into it, with the whole surrounding (Hell) in combination with the music just making everything feel badass, you can rarely find some edges that shouldn't be there, but they're very rare to find."

,Recommended,457210,29883998,Posted: 12 February,all,K O N S L E X,SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell in it's simplicity is game centered around speed and fast reaction.Graphics isn't SEUM's strongest side but it does make you feel like your stuck in this underground world which is ok. Soundtrack - even I don't listen to metal at all is great boost to the game and fits well.
,Recommended,457210,34759233,Posted: 5 September,all,General Kass,"SEUM is one of those weird games where almost everything when horribly horribly right. Essentially Super Meatboy meets Metalocalypse, SEUM (briefly) tells the story of a Marty, a metal fan, who cut off Satan's hand, duct-taped it to his own arm, and descends into the depths of hell.The game is just plain fun. That's what it is. It's fun. The game's description warns that you'll lean toward your screen as you play and its totally true. You'll tense up, feel the rush of hot air, and immerse yourself into the heavy metal landscape.Similar to Super Meatboy, SEUM initially gives levels that show you the ropes before testing your skills. However, where Super Meatboy continued to introduce new concepts and challenges into the late game, SEUM has a comparatively limited toolbox.This makes the late game of SEUM into a puzzle platformer with an emphasis on speed. You solve the puzzles first, then come up with the fastest way to do it. While not especially unique (Quantum Conundrum did it), the game has a great simulated movement that puts you right in the moment.Speaking of speed, I really appreciate how the game handles competitive speedrunning. Every run you make is logged into the system. Once you beat the ""Uber"" time, you can instantly see how the best people in the world run it. The great thing is that many levels have a second secertish way of solving puzzles, but the majority of levels can just barley be solved using the standard route if you have enough dexterity, training, and time.As for art design, the soundtrack is complementary and makes the game seem faster than it really is. Satan and Marty talk to each other from level to level and have some fun quips. The devil hand looks awesome and has fingernails made of stone. The backgrounds of hell are kind of hit or miss.You have 3 main regions: Generic lava landscape, dark green pit of bubbling acid with giant cheesy skeletons in cages hanging from the ceiling, and what I can only describe as Dethklok's wet dream. While the first and last areas are mostly fun to look at, the green pit isn't appealing to the eye and doesn't invoke images of hell. Additionally, there's really nothing to look at in the background. No tortured souls, no demons, etc. There's not a single full character model in the entire game. The last level in the story has you fighting Satan in one of the most anti-climactic ways possible. I really would have liked to see a Super Meatboy-esque race between Marty and Satan rather than another 90 second puzzle level.Still, that small gripe with art direction aside, I found SEUM to be an addictive and relaxing experience. An arcade game you can play for 5 minutes or 5 hours and hardly tell the difference."

The controls are butter smooth, the game is optimized better than a German Motorsport racecar, the levels are challenging but never unfair. As someone who loves oldschool metal, the soundtrack and artstyle are both awesome. I love how this game doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest, it's a good way of presenting it.Replay value depends on whether or not you're the competitive/perfectionist type. Plenty of collectibles and achievements, I especially like the ""Beer"" collectible because it encourages you to explore the levels even though this is a speedrunning game. The collectibles/achievements alone are enough to squeeze out a decent amount of hours. If you're the kind to hope for getting a top 10 ranking on any of the maps, well, then... sky's the limit. I also hope they will release more ""Extended Play"" levels as time goes on, Seasons 1 and 2 were pretty damn good.I got it during a sale, but definitely worth full price.

,Recommended,457210,26375786,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,!kyoob,"I just saw the word ""speedrunners"" in the name, so I decided, why not? And then I bought it. And, you know...I don't regret a single thing!This game combines what I like most in games, every major thing. First of all, it's a speedrunning game. Youhaveto be fast in order to progress, you have to find creative and unusual ways of completing a level, most of these ways being mostlyintended by developers. This game basically teaches you how to speedrun, which is, as for me, the greatest game idea ever.Secondly, Doom + Duke Nukem + references = the atmosphere of this game. I don'teven really kno how to describe it; the brutal protagonist Marty who seems to only care about his beer, Satan, hell... This atmosphere, in couple with the level design, is the greatest element combination I have ever seen. Huge thanks to developers for doing this in particular.Thirdly, gameplay. Not only do you have to run fast, you also have to aim well and calculate... Everything. From physics to positions of moving objects. There are also a few power-ups you can collect in a level, which you have to be smart with, too.Fourthly, secrets. Just running fast isn't enough to progress, you need to collect secrets in basically every single level, and the further down to hell you are, the harder it gets. I love both speedrunning and exploring, which depends on the game, so I always wondered if it was possible to somehow combine these two elements in one game. Well, I guess this is the game to accomplish that.Fifthly, global leaderboards and replays. If you somehow manage to complete the level fast enough to beat the par time, you'll be granted an ability to see how others completed the level, which is an amazing learning opportunity for beginners and not-so-experienced players (AKA noobs), and an excellent competition for pros.Sixthly, achievements. I can't say a lot about them because I haven't achieved a lot, but from what I've seen, they are hilarious and overall well-made. Unlike in most modern games, you don't get achievements for every step you make, you have to work hard to unlock most of them.Seventhly, the soundtrack. It'sawesome. I'd say, it's just the soundtrack I want in most FPS games, but it fits this one particularly well. If usually I start playing some YouTube video or some music from a social network, for this game, I actually close my browser and enjoy the game soundtrack. Just like in the older, classic games which are now legends.Overall, I can say that this game just brings back the nostalgia, still maintaining the drive and the speed. The gameplay is extremely entertaining, the level design is quite simple yet pleasing to the eye and bringing a feeling of overall brutality of what's happening. I don't know how to describe it, really, but need I? Try it out for yourself! I give this game 10/10 without hesitation, and I know for sure that this is what I'll be playing for the next month or so. Since Doom and Duke Nukem are now legends, I want SEUM to be a legend, tooCheers and huge thanks to Pine Studio,kyoob"

,Recommended,457210,24897377,"Posted: 13 August, 2016",all,[DFS] Calico,"You see, this is what makes indie games enjoyable. They don't have to be overly complex and expand beyond what the game is clearly capable, resulting in a giant, potentially confusing and empty mess. All you need is a fun premise, a silly storyline just for kicks, and above all, gameplay that will leave you want to play it over and over again.This game delivers just that. You play as a redneck/metalhead who's out to get Satan, because for some reason Satan thought it was a good idea to steal your beer. So you descend into hell, armed (heh) with a demonic arm severed from Satan himself, which shoots fireballs and can grant you several powerups such as anti-gravity, teleportation, or rewinding yourself to your last known position since you used the powerup, in order to retrieve your precious beverages.Gameplay is simple, yet challenging. It's basically a first person platformer, and your goal is to run like hell (puns are fun kids) from point A to point B while jumping, dodging, and using various powerups in order to not suffer a fiery death, and in the shortest time possible. You can also use your demonic arm to use powerups, and to shoot fireballs to clear out mines, or trigger switches. I say simple, because you really get the hang of it after only a couple minutes in, making the game really easy to get into. The challenge comes in timing your jumping and movements exactly right in order to arrive at the goal in the shortest time possible, to top a place among the leaderboards. There is a time limit, however you don't die immediately if it runs out. Rather, you can still explore the level as you wish, however when you do reach the goal you will have to start it over because you were too slow. This looks and plays reminiscent to something like Quake, or Doom, in regards to how fast-paced it is, which gives it extra points in my book.The real fun comes in trying to beat your friends in the leaderboards/making a name for yourself among the top. Which is way harder than it looks.The levels themselves start out simple, however you will have to learn to use combinations of powerups in conjunction in order to beat a level, and you will feel like a god once you successfully pull it off. There's also a wide variety of powerups, some of which can be combined in a very creative way which definitely spices up the gameplay.So far, I am loving the atmosphere in the game. as I mentioned before, seems to take inspiration from Quake and Doom to make for a really satisfying aesthetic. The soundtrack is also absolutely great too. Nothing quite like fast-paced platforming while heavy metal plays in the background.ConclusionOverall, would I reccomend it? Yes, I definitely would advise you to try it out. It's fun, is simple, and this is a shining example as to what indie games should be like. Smooth gameplay, and just letting you have a whale of a time.10/10"

,Recommended,457210,31502867,Posted: 2 May,all,Yeti,"SEUM is one of a kind. It takes the concept behind platformers, puzzle games, and speedrunning then sends it to hell where you, Marty, have to retrieve your beer after Satan broke into your house, removed your hand, and stole all of your alcohol. You've vowed to avenge what you have lost and must run through the many of cirlces of hell with nothing but the hand of Satan and a kick a.ss metal soundtrack.Mechanically this game is fantastic. The movement is incredibly well tuned and the level design is very creative and well designed. In addition to speedrunning through various traps and obstacles, you are also given powers. You can shoot fireballs, reverse gravity, teleport, spawn platforms, and reverse time. This adds another dimension to the complexity of the already intricate levels. It's a very satisfying game to play, especially after you spend hours perfecting one level and finally make a flawless run. You can also compare leaderboard rankings with others and friends. The top 10 on each course will go down into the ""Pit of Infamy"" at the end of the Season to concrete your success in SEUM's history. There are also various hidden collectibles, pathways, and QR Codes throughout the game as well as a level editor with workshop support.ConclusionIf you are into speedrunning, skill games, puzzles and problem solving, are a completionist, level creator, or just love improving your skills I can't recommend this game enough. There's not many games like this, and much less so that executed it so well. The options menus are fairly in depth between graphics, controls, and various preferential options. It's very stable, lacks bugs or quirks almost entirely, and overall feels great to play. Performance is smooth and I have not ran into any FPS issues or stuttering. The level design is incredible and there's around 15 hours worth of courses, depending on how quick you're able to get through them, not including workshop maps and collectibles. There are also Extended play (pretty much free DLC), Speedrun mode, and a procedurally generated Endless mode. I paid full price for this game and I have loved every minute of it, even when bashing my keyboard in from frustration. If you're into this kind of game, I believe $15 to be more than fair."

The game also offers both global and fiends only leaderboards so it's easy to have a bit more fun by directly competing with your Steam friends.I especially applaud the choice to go with a very large number of short levels. This way you still get substantial total gameplay time and in the same time you are able to get in and out the game very quickly. So SEUM can be a great way of passing time or taking short breaks.Controls are simple and spot on.Soundtrack and graphics do their job well. Most importantly they both blend well together and make a very solid background that doesn't become annoying even after you are retrying the first level for 3 hours strait just to get into the Top 10 on global leaderboards...My only suggestion would be to somehow give more feedback to the player when he bumps into a wall.All in all a very good game worthy of your time.

It's meant to be cult game as in it's not meant for every gamer. But it sure is a load of fun for gamer like myself who spend hundreds of hours playing in BHop servers on CS:S, CS 1.6, CS:GO and Garry's Mod.It has a killer soundtrack, a sick theme (The theme is hell... Speedrunners from Hell... Not a very subtle title.), smooth enough gameplay (though could be improved), built-in global rankings... All I'm saying is it has everything you'd expect from a ""Speedrunning"" game. And the devs recently announced they're working on a map editor and workshop support so we will have more content than we'll need hopefully.To sum it up, this is sub-genre game very specific to certain gamers. If you're among us, it'll be a blast playing through about a 100 levels. In my eyes, SEUM will always be remembered as a cult game that delivered the content a small portion of gamers wanted."

The power ups are all super cool and each have a really solid difficulty curve, easy to learn and fun to master.The thing that consistently impresses me is the level design. While the visuals and style leave some things to be desired, the amount of variety and use of the core mechanics is just phenomenal.

,Recommended,457210,27997965,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,nͫiͤcͫeͤ,"SEUM: Speedrunners From Hell is one of the most rewarding indie games I've played in a while. I fell in love with it during the first half hour of gameplay. It's like Portal by way of Iron Maiden, combining spatial puzzle solving with break-neck speeds and fast-twitch reflexes. Every level is worthy of multiple attempts because they present two different challenges: one of planning, and another of execution. Each level is a puzzle, and as you attempt them over and over you notice places where entire milliseconds can be shaved off through the use of a different technique. It gives you the ""AHA!"" moment that the best puzzle games offer, but in a context where you're too busy having fun to feel like an idiot for not noticing the solution sooner.Unlike Portal, the difficulty ramp in SEUM is perfectly balanced. I was a couple of hours into the game before I really started to sweat the latest levels, but by then I had already gone back and repeated all my previous levels in order to get better times and move up the ranking system. If you find yourself getting stuck on a particular challenge then there's always a huge amount of other content waiting to be challenged.The best part of the game is the sense of achievement you get when you perfectly execute a run and manage to increase your ranking on that particular level by shaving 200 milliseconds off your previous best time. There're so many great levels that I want to constantly revisit and practise in order to inch closer to the top 100 rankings. My favourite level so far is #36, Parachute. The moment at which I got the 71st fastest time on the leader board might be my gaming highlight of the year. I was so exhilarated by the sense of speed, tension and satisfaction that I could hardly drag myself away from the game.The soundtrack is an original composition of heavy metal tracks that are all of a really high quality. They're all instrumental pieces with an emphasis on roaring guitar solos that keep up the tempo and push the player forwards, deeper into speedrunning hell.The game has some flaws. The graphics are straight from 2010 and look like something I'd expect from a Source mod. Very few textures in the game hold up on close examination and the graphics settings are lacklustre. Humour abounds in SEUM but only half of it really hits for me, and when I've played the same level 300 times back to back, hearing Satan repeat his funny one-liner to taunt me starts to lose its charm. The powers the player uses during the game all have the potential to be frustrating to use, depending on the level. And that's about it; a few nit-picks but nothing worth crying over.This game is advertised as being ""the first heavy metal speedrunning game"", which sounds like a joke until you play it and realise what an excellent idea a heavy metal speedrunning game truly is. For me, it's a real under-rated classic, a better tribute to heavy metal than Brutal Legend could ever be, and well worth the £10 price tag."

I'm not including the bonus levels on this review since I didn't collect the hidden goodies. This will be my first steam review too.GameplayThe object of the game is simply to make it to the end of each level by making contact through these blue portals that act as a finish line. If I am not wrong there are hidden beers and among other stuff on each level that you can find if you want to look around, these will unlock bonus levels especially the ones around Floor 9. Platforming for the most part is solid, the only annoying thing I found is that jumping up through a platform section feels a bit slippery since you slide around a bit while climbing. Other than that there isn't much else to note, I am clearly not an expert on platform speedrunning but I did have a good time trying to make it through each level. You can try to achieve the best time to complete each level if your into that sort of thing, with some levels you'd be at first baffled to figure out how it was done so quickly. In conclusion about the gameplay, it's solid even if I'm not a fan of this genre.SoundtrackThe music this game has to offer can get a bit repetitive even if each song is interesting and helps you keep going on each level. It's possibly something I cannot play outside of this game but the songs are good for what they are. Or maybe  I only like certain types of metal music.Art DesignThe environments look interesting when you spend the time looking at it. I can't go into detail because I'm not an art person but long story short the art and the look of the game does its job and I didn't notice anything bad about it.Voice ActingThere isn't a lot of it in this game when I went through the regular levels but some lines are heard over and over depending on the circumstances, the lines are there just to be there pretty much. It's not a very story driven game so you don't have to listen to a lot of voice acting.ConclusionOverall it is a solid platformer if you are into repetitive gameplay similar to other games you have played just like Geometry Dash, Portal or any other game that requires you to do memorization. The fact that this game has its own look and design prevents it from being a complete copycat and it turned out to be fun when you give it a chance. I covered the entire regular levels this game has to offer and I have gameplay videos on my playthrough of it when I livestreamed it if you want to know what the experience was like.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZOoOwcoHd4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87yfnUz_6OEhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCR4b6nQlEE6.5/10"

Go through trials using different powers to get your beer back. Along with shooting fireballs, you can teleport, rewind, reverse gravity, and create platforms, depending on the level. And man some of these levels are hard as hell (pun sort of intended), so playing a level to try to beat it over and over, finding the secret beer or bacon (there is one in every single level), and optimizing your time to get into the top 10 best times is going to make you sink a lot of hours into this game (I've sunk about 12 hours as of writing this and I've almost done with the main campaign, but just started on the next episode). I also really love the metal-and-hell aesthetic, and the art style fits very nicely into that.In a recent update, they've released a level editor for the community to create and share their levels, which was the final push for me to pick this up, because now there is virtually endless replay value, in playing over 200 community made levels and create your own masterpiece.EDIT: Linux version does allow you to use the level editor.Seum is also very well optimized and runs really well for Linux.

He than quickly reacts and cuts the Devils own arm off in return before the Devil slips back into Hell. The Redneck attaches the devils arm to his own and chases after the devil through Hell to get his beer back, wihle getting the oppurtonity to weild awesome devil powers to navigate through the different levels of hell as quickly as possible.That is the plot behind this game, how can you not get exited to play this game. It is a steal paying 15 dollars for this game. I have already put over 4 hours into it, and am only about half way through the game. The controls are smooth, the levels are challenging and daverse. There are different modes to play through, and some wicked powers to help over come challenges as quick as possilbe. There is a running leaderboard on each level, to show where you rank up against the world for time. It is addictive and so much fun.The only reason this isnt a perfect 10 is because there are some slight flaws with the game. The big one is that later through the game, the hidden beer cans are insanly hard to find unless you stumble across them by accident. The second  time objective is usally understanbly hard to get, but its fair, except for a choosen few levels, to where you have to be near perfect to grab the time needed for the medal. Usally when you run into those issues there are shortcuts you just havnt found yet, but there are a few levels where there are no shortcuts and you just have to be that good which is a bit unfair in my opinion.Outside of that, this game is amazing and everyone who enjoys first person shooters or games like Portal, should play this game."

76561198040868056,Recommended,457210,29101281,Posted: 7 January,all,ZuTheSkunk,"""SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell"" is a first-person platformer where your entire goal is to reach the end of the level as fast as possible.As its subtitle suggests, the gameplay is heavily calibrated towards taking every risky move and trick imaginable in an attempt to slice off as many precious milliseconds from your record as you conceivably can. And in that sense, SEUM does its job wonderfully.Your character is capable of doing three things: running, jumping, and throwing infinite amounts of fireballs. And that's really all you need, since as the levels go on, the game throws more and more obstacles and unusual level designs at you, always requiring you to think fast and learn from your mistakes. Much like Super Meat Boy, you are going to die a lot and keep respawning again and again until you manage to nail a level, the only difference being that you have a keyboard shortcut with which you can respawn instantly.You are going to have to deal with lots of spikes, swinging blades, rings to jump through, moving platforms, sawblades, and so on. On top of that, you eventually get ahold of four different powerups, each adding a new angle to the gameplay. The controls are very tight and everything is very tightly designed, making it a joy to perfectly nail some of the more risky maneuvers. Almost every time you fail, you can tell that it's your own fault, and you immediately take note of the things to improve on during your next attempt.The game's humorous take on the theme of hell also works very well and sets up a lovely tongue-in-cheek atmosphere, where you feel that you are some beer-chugging badass who jumps across hell like it's nothing, all while bobbing his head to the awesome heavy-metal soundtrack. The surrounding hellish environments are really nice to look at and provide a nice backdrop for the action happening in front of you.Really, the only things I could complain about are largely nitpicks. For instance, the graphics seem a little dated - the game appears not to use normal maps or shadows, so everything is kinda flat and covered by global, uniform lighting. On top of that, the developers' idea of creating a wall seems to be taking a rectangle and slapping a wall texture onto it - and while they try to cover that up with some extra decorative bits, sometimes this graphical simplicity becomes rather apparent, to the point that there were times where I felt like I was playing a Gmod map or something. I realize that this is probably because they wanted the graphics to not get in the way of the gameplay, but still...One other complaint I would have is that while the Level Editor is quite easy to learn and use, it's still missing some important features at the time of me writing this review - such asdrag select. I mean, really?!But despite this, SEUM is an awesome game and easily one of the best games I bought myself this Christmas. If you like fast-paced platforming, then this is a game for you. Especially because it's far easier to master its controls than Super Meat Boy's."

However, after playing 10+ hours of the game, i wish i hadn't. The first few floors of the game are VERY fun, but i found that after a while of playing the aesthetic became boring to look at. Even with very similar visuals on every level i was enjoying the game a lot up until ~floor 7, at this point the game started to feel very tedious, and the longer levels started getting very annoying. Levels 80 and 81 also felt very clunky and the feeling of being able to move through the level very smoothly wasn't there anymore. I have only done the hidden ritual levels 1-3 at this point, but the third one is horrible, it has three rings spinning around very fast, so not only are you spinning, but you are spinning while trying to jump to the next ring, then on the final ring witch is spinning so fast it was making me motion sick, you have to jump from that to a non-moving platform with the end portal on it, but when you jump off of a spinning platform it flings you in the direction it was spinning, so it's incredibly hard to land there. Overall the game has a lot of content in it, but in my opinion only about 2.5 4ths of it was fun and worth doing. I do plan to go back at some point and finsih all the hidden levels and such. My final reveiw of this game is a 2/5. If you see this game on sale for ~$8 and you really like speedrunning/platforming games i would recommend buying it, however i wouldnt pay any more than $10 for it.Edit: I forgot to mention that there were multiple levels that were very glitchy, and i was even able to go through the ground and walls on some of them.TLDR, 2/5, dont buy for more than $10."

,Not Recommended,457210,33381672,Posted: 8 July,all,hiandbye,"Incredibly boring, uninspired level design, filled with gimmicks and long, straight, entirely unchallenging corridors; sluggish, unresponsive controls, partly because in this game a mid-tier video card can't achieve 60 fps on anything but the lowest graphics settings; very generous target times, that require little skill and innovation to beat.These things come together to severly hinder the mastery of control that is usually crucial in speedrunning, the ability to execute insanely precise tricks consistently to get a better time. Again, since the level design is so bland you will have a hard time finding any levels where such skills are needed, but it still feels frustrating while playing.The aesthetic of the game is well done, music and presentation fit together to create a fast paced, metal experience, the macho quips between the guy and Satan are funny, if you like that sort of stuff.Overall, it's a speedrunning game for casual players that's not very fun to actually speedrun. If you're looking for a First Person Shooter to speedrun that has precise controls and requires and facilitates absolute mastery of them I can recommend Lovely Planet instead."

,Recommended,457210,30941082,Posted: 4 April,all,Dan Schneider | csgospeed.com,"The plot of this game is what really makes it the game that it is. Sure, speedrunning is fun, but for a speedrunning game to have as great of a plot as this takes dedication, style and investment.The game follows the emotional journey of Marty, a metal loving middle aged man, who's pride and joy was taken away from him. In a swift act of revenge Marty must travel to hell and back to save that which he loves so dearly.This game is the epitome of art.Pros:Great level design.Soundtrack is fantastic.Fourth Wall breaking in voice lines. Always a sign of a great game.Cons:Some beer locations are really weird. (e.gPyramid has a secret rotating point, for some reason?)Invisible platforms in some levels that only appear once you've triggered other ones.Difficult to get uber skulls in some levels without a guide.All in all, memes aside, great game."

The graphics are decent and the custom level workshop is great! The game has 90 levels to play but at level 40 I had the feeling they kind of gave up and just made the levels really quickly to just finish the game... I do still recommend the game but i'd wait for a sale!
