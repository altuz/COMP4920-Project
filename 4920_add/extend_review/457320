,Recommended,457320,23389629,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,Togan,"I'm a casual racquet ball/tennis player, and after the update this game is now better than ever.Before the update, this was a great game.  The core game was solid, but my only gripe was that each shot felt more like a ricochet rather than an actual swing. When I would serve the ball with all my might, sometimes it'd be a cannon, and sometimes it'd be a dud. You'd get a lucky defensive shot ricochet with power into the AI's sweet spot. You really just had to make contact to stay competitive with expert AI.Since the update, ALL these problems have been resolved.  EVERY Time I serve, it zooms across the court like I intended.  Also, those fast serves get a FAST return volley.  If you serve with power, be prepared to react within a split second. Now my defensive shots are slow and easy for the AI to pick up. Against harder AI, you truly have to earn each point and smash the ball into their sweet spot.It also now gives you a warning to use your wrist straps and perhaps replace your Vive straps with Wii straps. I am a victim of Vive straps breaking off, causing the controller to fly into the wall.  You do not want a $110 repair bill from HTC support. Trust me.Great game: A must buy for racquet ball, tennis, squash players, or anyone with a mild interest in racquet sports really."

,Recommended,457320,29317402,Posted: 17 January,all,Patsonical,"This game is extremely fun, challenging and gets you moving. Many people compare it to CyberPong and, having played its demo, I can honestly say that this game is better.The main problem with CyberPong, compared to this, is that here the ball actually responds to how quickly you hit it. In CyberPong, the ball goes at the same speed most of the time. In multiplayer, it just speeds up over the course of the point, but gently tapping it has the same result as hitting it with force. Here, you can feel the momentum of your bat/racket/thing getting transferred to the ball. The ball even curves if you hit it right. There is also a subtle vibration as you move your controller, making it feel as though you are actually holding a lightsaber! The music is fantastic and fits very well into the theme of the game, and the visuals make you feel as though you stepped into Tron: Legacy. This is further augmented by what the AI (your opponent) says: things like ""next human please"" if you lose and ""this may be a quirk of the reality we graced you with"" if you score a point. Kinda reminds me of GLaDOS, honestly.To conclude, this game is super fun to play (it kinda feels like a workout after longer sessions) and its atmosphere is spot on. I can't wait for things like multiplayer to be added (which IS listed in theComing Soonsection in the description, which is nice).If this review sounded like an essay, I'm sorry, it's the middle of Exam Week."

Then, that child grew up, and had a baby with the classic indoor sport of racquetball. That wonderful, miracle, of a baby, is named; HoloBall!HoloBall is a competitive sport-like game in which takes place in what appears to be a neon version of a racquetball court. The goal is to win against a snarky, sarcastic, comedic AI, and attempting to get the highscore to get your name up on the leaderboard. Doing so, immenses a challenge and a great amount of fun! The different difficulty levels, really help to match your level of skill. The harder the difficulty, the larger the court and the smaller the ball. The racket has perfect physics! It feels all so very natural swinging at the ball attempting to get it passed the AI. Not only is this game a large amount of fun, its a great workout too if you really get into it!I highly recommend purchasing this game for anyone who even has a slight interest in; Racquetball, Tennis, or even the original Pong.Warning: DON'T LET GO OF YOUR CONTROLLER!

76561198344708794,Not Recommended,457320,30180870,Posted: 25 February,all,shauniedarko,"This game is so close to being perfect.  For the first hour, I was in love with this game.  It was after the first hour that the issues began to arise.  The first is that the AI shoots the ball right on the edge of the play space.  Now, they do have a way to add padding to your play space to keep you from hitting walls, and that's a great thing to have, but when the AI is consistently throwing shots that make you fearful of hitting a wall (I hit a picture frame and smashed the glass) it stops being fun.  Tweaking the AI to keep it from throwing so many shots on the play space line would go a long way.The other issue is the physics of the ball.  They're just not right.  Hit the ball to the left, and it curves to the right.  It does all these weird curves that make absolutely no sense and make it difficult to have any sort of strategy.  Why try to hit the ball in one direction when it's just going to fly off in the direction it wants to anyway?  That might have to do with the way the paddles are angled in relation to the controllers.  You can't hold the controllers normally and have the paddles be at a normal angle.  It's odd.  Allowing the user to modify the angle of the paddles would be nice.Overall, fun game.  But if you have a small play area or are looking for a paddle ball game where you can actually control the direction of the ball, look elsewhere.  Though I'm recommending it, I do so with reservations.Yeah, I had to change my rating after continuing the play.  I just can't recommend this game. The AI is atrocious and the physics governing the ball cause one hit straight on to curve off to the side or even go behind you, which makes this game just too frustrating to bother with."

I'm not particularly masterful at any sport (real or otherwise), but this feels well-balanced. I am currently just about beating the computer on Medium every time and now am ready to try Hard. I've found myself gloating at the AI player after a nailing particularly good serve or offhand smash (which includes pointing my right-hand paddle at it and saying ""HA F**K YOU LOSER!"") and the feeling of personal shame when you fluff a particularly simple shot still gets me.Some quick tips:- Be mindful of where BOTH paddles are. A couple of times I've tried a backhand and my off-hand has gotten in the way and rebounded the ball back through my own goal.- You can tee up the ball on the serve before smashing it. Makes nailing Aces much more likely (my best is 4 in a row). I can foresee that, with practice, I could start to Roddick the crap out of this and hit them every time).- Low returns are a ♥♥♥♥♥. Be prepared to get down low and deflect them back defensively.- Don't be afraid of your weaker hand - you might actually find that your % success rate is better as you'll hit so many more across to the other side of the goal and the AI might not make it in time.I'm looking forward to seeing where this games goes.

,Recommended,457320,22822783,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","If Holopoint is the game that will make you hate the Vive's breakout box, Holoball is the game that will make you hate its wrist straps. I personally haven't had any experiences with anyone letting go of the controller yet, but I've seen plenty of evidence elsewhere, and it's a bit telling that Nintendo has suddenly sold out of every color of wrist strap except the basic white, so if you don't always keep a good grip or know someone who might not be too careful then you might want to get a beefier wrist strap before you play this one.As for the game itself, it's simple but fun, like most of the cheaper Vive games I've played. It's sort of like pong mixed with tennis, in which you play against an AI. If you've got a spectator they can also take over the AI and play with WASD, but in my experience they won't stand a chance and it's better to just leave it to the computer. There are four difficulties that you unlock as you complete the previous one, and it can be a pretty good workout on the later difficulties. It's not necessarily the sort of thing that's super impressive on a technological level, but for the price it offers a fair amount of entertainment unless you manage to break your wrist strap, in which case the only people being entertained may be the TV repair company."

Maybe the developer will add some more, but it's not bad as it is.But BE CAREFUL. I had someone try it out and while playing, the wrist strap on the controller SNAPPED OFF and he lost his grip and the controller flew into the wall and stopped working. Thanks to a guide I found online I was able to fix it by opening it up and reconnecting a strip, but it's much better to not have your controllers break at all. So hold those controllers tight when you're playing this game! I would even recommend putting something different on for a wrist strap. I use the ones from the Wii controllers now."

Your goal is to get the HoloBall to the opposing side of the wireframe, tetrahedron court, whilst preventing your opponent from achieving the same.Stylistically the design is spot on. A very clean and pure 80's digital distopia, which will remind many of you of the iconic ""Tron"" films.The music sets the tone perfectly and compliments the aesthetic too a tee.Occasionally it feels as if the collider for the paddle is not keeping up with the update cycle. This could be a problem with the Physics Engines update period, (I'd be interested to know if they've got it set at 90FPS). Alternatively I could be getting old and decrepit.The HoloBall will occasionally ignore that my paddle is inside it's spawn box, which frequently results in own goals whilst I gloat over my perfect serve. This is irritating and unless a real♥♥♥♥♥♥up has occured during development, should be a very simple fix.The obvious feature request would be multiplayer, pvp and co-op would be great fun.Alternatively someone else will probably create a knock off on this idea and implement the above...Who knows, my weekend is pretty clear!All in all, great game, lots of fun, decent work out.

I have to be mindful that I'm in my lounge and not in a futuristic Tron world.

The amazing soundtrack, the snarky AI, the perfect art design, and the challenge that ramps up in just the right way. It's one of my essential VR experiences.If you have multiple play areas available, then use the one with the most width. This gives the AI a wider area to return the ball and makes the game even better."
,Recommended,457320,24590159,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,arleas,"Quick First Impression review since I started this up after midnight and I don't want to disturb any neighbors.I started the thing up and the first thing that stuck out to me is: WTF is that robot dude saying?  His voice is the worst thing ever.  Imagine some guy making his voice sound unnaturally deep and then standing behind an electric fan and talking and you'll be on the right track.  If you're going to make a robot voice make it intelligible.  Or just make R2D2 sounds and give me subtitles...So anyway, the 2nd thing that struck me was ""Wow, this is a big ♥♥♥♥ing room!"" and it was... like far bigger than the room I was playing it in... I started to worry that I was going to run into walls.  I tried not to run...This is a game where you will want to run though.  Keep that in mind.So those things aside, what is this game?  Think ""VR pong"".  It's like all my old 70's and 80's arcade buddies came back in VR form!  So  yeah, you get a big ole paddle  (One in each hand actually) and a multifaceted VR Ball appears in front of you... swing your paddle and the ball flies towards the big red square that represents your robot AI enemy.  He makes sure his large red square hits the ball and it flies back toward you.   You will likely wind up having to dash a bit to get to the ball in time and thus you start to annoy anyone downstairs.At first the only two modes available to you are Zen (where you're just whacking the ball against the wall) and Easy... and I assume to unlock the harder modes you have to beat the easier modes.  Fair enough.  I wouldn't want to challenge the game on hard without proving I'm not going to have a heart attack on medium first anyway.There isn't a whole lot else to this game (or so it seems).  There was a customize option but I have no idea what options are available to customize.  Maybe paddle size? ball size?  Some kind of documentation would be nice...maybe there is some and I just didn't see it.  It's certainly not in-game though.Anyway... VR Pong, guys... this is pretty much what you can expect.  It feels a lot like you're playing squash or tennis (minus the net).  I think they could do better with this game if they added some stuff to it though... Maybe change the gravity or add some better sound effects... As it is now, it'll be a good workout (so many games this applies to) but whether that translates to fun or not has yet to be seen.I'll update this review when I've had more time with it.  For now it gets a tentative thumbs up because it seems to have potential."

First of all, the gameplay is perfection. This game feels like you're really there, playing racketball in the matrix for your life... or something. The rackets, the way they interact and the haptic feedback is superb. Fortunately, because with this type of game it would otherwise be frustrating if the physics and racket+ball interaction didn't feel right. I love serving the ball after each point, it's very rewarding.Now, on to the graphics and the atmosphere: Simply amazing. The 80's/drive color scheme and ""plot"" is felt the entire time you play. The AI ""enemy"" will even stop the music occasionally to talk smack to you or just add to the immersion. Reviews basically saying this is pong are made by people that probably don't appreciate art or anything beyond 1's and 0's, don't listen to them.Lastly, multiplayer is in the works - per devs.This game is worth every penny. Of all the ""simple-arcadey, demo-like experiences"" on the vive, this game actually shines as a worthy ""simple"" game as it has character beyond.

Seriously. You're on a neon light, wire-framed racquetball-type court, with each Vive controller represented as a paddle. Your goal is to hit the holoball past the black/red trash-talking AI square at the far end of the court.If you own a Vive and want a decent workout, then buy this game. It's quite easy to work up a sweat through this game (you may want to invest in some VR Covers to avoid your headset foam eventually smelling like your gym locker). It's also great fun in addition to the exercise factor.If you for some reason let go of your controllers at random, do NOT buy this game. Although I've not once came close to letting my Vive controller fly out of my hand, for some reason this game seems to be THE reason for the majority of broken Vive controllers.And assuming you have replaced the standard Vive wrist-straps with Wii straps (seriously, if not, go order some now because the standard straps WILL FAIL EASILY), this is a great demo game since it is so easy to pick up and play. Gameplay is literally swinging your arms to hit the ball. No buttons to worry about. No control schemes. Just tell them to use the paddle to hit the ball and let them enjoy the game."

Even keeping this in mind I managed to send things flying off my desk in the first match when I reached for a hit; be careful! It's not the games fault, it clearly shows you the boundaries.

Great use of room scale and motion controls for a fun experience straight out of your favorite 80's-video-game-inspired movie. Good music but the narration was hard to hear and understand. First couple of games were rough, but they inspired me to get better and keep going. The AI challenge is surprisingly good and will make you work up a sweat. Would definitely recommend for someone looking to get active and have fun with a good challenge. Plays similarly to Raquetball, but I'm no good at Raquetball and this was so much more fun (less running too)."

The music is great and helps you get into it even more. Feels like you are in the movie Tron. For a racquet ball player this game is a must. Can easily get lost in this game for a while. Would be cool to see a mutliplayer version maybe in the futurer or different game modes/ challenges. Overall great game for a good price!

Can only recommend it to everyone as it is a good ""showcase"" of how room-scale VR can look like.+ Nice and colourful graphics+ Good music+ Very fun and challenging+ Kind of workout-ish- Real mutliplayer would be awesome!- Sometimes physics are not yet fully acurate (hit the ball and then it slowly goes to the out)"

The physics are great, the frame rate is great and the AI is solid enough to learn your weak spots (at least it feels that way).  Of all the ball smashing pong related games out so far, this one is the best.  Worth every penny."

I've beaten the Expert mode a few times now, and I'm still just amazed at how fast and accurate this game, along with the Vive hardware, is able to track the controller movements.  It really matters how fast you swing the ""racket"", the position of the racket, etc.  I'm amazed at how accurately the ball comes off my racket, and how I can apply spin and have the ball curve in a realistic way... Just like a real tennis ball does, although a bit more dramatically.  And while I can beat Expert mode now, I can't do it consistently because its still incredibly challenging.  Perfect level of difficulty! (at least for me)  And great exercise too!  Hats off to the developers, and to the Vive hardware!  Looking forward to multiplayer... That should be pretty cool, if it is done right."

It has some of the most basic mechanics, and yet it is one of the most exciting VR games I have played. As someone who owns both the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift I would say this is one of my all time favorite games out of all of those that I have played. I find my self consistenly going back to this everytime I hook up the Vive. It's not that its the most adventurest, and it sure as hell doesnt have a story line, but it's entertaining. I have spent hours playing this game, it is a fun work out and is truly enjoyable. If I were in better shape, I would have more hours on record.. just saying.The only downside I have found with this game is that I got too immersed in the experience and ended up throwing my controller across the room. Yeah. Classic Wii situation. However I was wearing the straps, they just simply snapped with too much forced applied. I reached out to HTC to see if they could replace the controller and it was going to be something like $100. I hope they get these straps fixed soon, otherwise I could see this being another Nintendo situation."

The aesthetics are perfectly in tune with the visuals, the glowing pinks and blues mesmerizing as you duel the hateful A.I., all the while getting your blood pumping through intense acrobatic and badass motions with your lazer batons.It'sthe first Vive game I've purchased that's room-scale only, and it puts it to great use.

Purchase HoloBall.When I got my vive, I wanted some type of sports game that would get me active and be immersive enough to keep me at it for a good long time. HoloBall was a great choice. It has several game modes that have weekly and all-time leaderboards, you can use both controllers for paddles if you choose to do so and I'm sure you'll fall in love with the smart-mouthed computer.

,Not Recommended,457320,34740221,Posted: 4 September,all,Teemu,"Physics of hitting the ball with the paddles were totally of. Only if you lightly touched the ball with the paddle, you could somewhat get the ball going where you wanted. But then there isn't enought speed. The harder you hit the ball, the more random its reaction would be. And sometimes it felt like the ball went straight throught the bat if you hit it too hard.Maybe I was expecting too much having played lots of Eleven Table Tennis recently, where you have quite accurate physics and much more control over the ball."
76561197973511105,Recommended,457320,35092668,Posted: 20 September,all,Ryan,Decent enough. Found the 'hit zone' to be a bit off. Kept missing the ball despite clearly swining in the right place. Not sure if it's an issue with the shape of the virtual paddle or something but other similar games (e.g. RacketNX) don't have the same problem. Returned for a refund as the inconsistent hits were bothering me too much but judging by the other reviews other people seem to enjoy it and not have the same frustrations.
