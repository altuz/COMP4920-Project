,Recommended,457330,29492108,Posted: 25 January,all,TylerKun,"I just want to start by saying that you should not listen to the reviews saying negative things about this game. All of them have the same thing in common. 0.1 hours played.High Octane Drift is very fun and easy to get a handle on. It definetly is not like any real drifting, but that is almost the beauty of it. It's a new mechanic to learn and it's fun to practice it and get better.The customization of cars is awesome. There are not as many cars as I would like, but it's still in development. Modifications are very good. There are many different options with pros and cons on each part. I would like to see more body kits and exterior modifications, but again, I still have hope for the future.When first starting there is a tuorial of some sort... For me it was buggy and not helpful at all. I did resort to asking other people online (Mostly everyone online is pretty cool too) about things and using Google. After playing and messing with things on my own, it came along pretty quickly.Microtransactions are 100% not needed and not intrusive at all. You do get an edge by paying real money, but name a game that you dont get an edge by paying.There is also a mechanic where you must repair your vehicle, buy tires, buy fuel, etc. At first I was very turned off by this, but it is not bad at all.Overall High Octane Drift needs some work to be better, but being in open development means they will gradually improve! I'd definetly say play this game and spend at least 30 minutes in it"

I would simply click the buy car button, then click yes and the game would do nothing. It won't take money and it won't give me the car. Please fix this."

,Recommended,457330,29723570,Posted: 5 February,all,YDproductions,This is the best drifting game I have ever played. I have attempted many but none can compare to how great this game is. There is car building public drift events. Tandem lines. Anything you want in drifting and building cars they have it.

,Recommended,457330,29574704,Posted: 29 January,all,Rockybarry,"This game, although great when you have the money, isn't really fun if you don't have the money. Freemium games should still let you become very good just as easily as people who pay money for the game even if you never spend money on it.Take notes on Clash Royale. While it is a freemium game and you can get stuff faster with money, it still doesn't take away the skill aspect of the game. A free to play player is still as capable as a player who pays money for the game.In High Octane Drift's case, however, a free to play player has a huge disadvantage against a pay to play player, as the car you start off with is completely mediocre.For that I say, if you have enough money and are willing to use that money to have fun, play this game. But if you don't have money, playing this game will just be a lot of grinding."

The game is really good, tends to lag just a little, but it's not intolerable.

,Not Recommended,457330,29414536,Posted: 21 January,all,Escalator Death Horror,"This is one of the singular worst games I have ever played. It may be a free game, but it is not worth the disk space it occupys. It is a waste of time. Not only is it a waste, we humans have a small time on Earth, and any second playing this game is so much of a waste you will regret playing this game on your deathbed. This game is a waste of brain cells. The physics are awful, you can't even drift. If you try to drive normally your car is if a piece of butter were to slip and slide on pure oil. This game isn't even free. It is a pay to win game that expects you to pay real money for new cars/upgrades, considering the progression on this game is incredibly slow. You could spend your money on microtransactions in this game instead on a good game, such as anything else. Even Big Rigs Over The Road Racing is a better game than this. The cars look good, but then again, thots can look good. Looks can be decieving. Out of 10, my overall score for this game is being fisted in a back allyway by a middle aged man named Pedro/10"
