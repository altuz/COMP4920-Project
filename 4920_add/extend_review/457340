This game is extremely boring to me. The ""puzzles"" are trial and error with no thought required. The pacing is slow, the sound is almost non-existant, and a few of the mechanics are actually meaningless. As a first foray into VR, sure, it's not completely terrible, but beyond the fact that you're there, which the game gets just by being a VR title, it has no wow factor or fun factor. It's not for everyone, that's for sure."

If you've played Unseen Diplomacy (or wished you could!) this is a full game along the same lines, with more polish and puzzling. Level-based; there are 5 levels (plus another.... :) ) in version 0.2.0. I'm looking forward to more!The developer answered my first question in hours and seems highly motivated.Absoutely an Early Access title worth throwing a few bucks at - it's worth the price of admission for what it is, let alone what it promises to be."
,Recommended,457340,29213658,Posted: 12 January,all,lloyd709,I've got about 30 VR games and this is in my top 3.  It's not about legging it around killing things or doing foward rolls every 5 seconds.   It's just  very imersive slow moving puzzel type game that gives you a good take on what VR is really good at.  It has the feeling that a lot of effort from a dedicated small development team or person has been put in.  The teleporting works perfectly with this alowing me to play behind my desk in very limited space without making me sick at all.While playing I like to imagine I'm not acutally pretending to be there but that I've actually been virtually placed there - so teleporting within the world is actually how you would do it in real life - if you know what I mean!!!

There is a definitive feeling of presence in here... looking over the edge of a room to see lava below you definitely gives you the same feeling as real life.Comfort: I usually get sick playing a lot of vr games, but this one is pretty comfortable as long as you stay away from the walls(there seems to be a bug in the current version)."

It took me 4.5 hours to complete the game but there are some secrets and bot letters stilling missing.Positive:+ gameplay is somehow something different to all the other games, slow paced but not boring+ puzzles are good and vary a lot+ certain game elements are nearly, physically exhausting (jumping, last level, jerry...)+ every level is different (at least until now)+ jerryNegative:- graphics are neither good nor varied- story is not very creative or at least not told very well- you somehow get the impression this is a collection of game elements proof of concepts- jerry"

This game needs some patience in the early stages but really takes off once you are comfortable with teh basic ideas. I hope that the author will keep adding levels."

This game contains so many VR ideas and concepts, it 's awsome.It's kind of puzzle game, but with ideas never seen elsewhere.It's built especially for VR, using many mechanics only available on this support.Gfx are simple, but efficient.Sounds and ambiance are top notch....Add an alien base conspiracy scenario, and you have a fantastic adventure, with clever level design.The experience is mind blowing.Like many VR games, I wait updates to play them to the end, so don't watch  my time of gaming....But I think I will stop this way of doing, and start to enjoy this kind of gems immediately, instead of instant-buy hyped robberies.This game roxxx. And for less than a cigarette pack...."

I love being able to move by teleporting or in FPS mode although you need good balance for this until you get used to it. FUN!
,Recommended,457340,33908046,Posted: 30 July,all,Dr.Death,"This game seems pretty simple at a first glance, the graphics are rather cheap and the story is pretty flat. It has a good potion of humor though.However, VR vise, the game is well worth every penny!There is so many VR mechnics built in every level, you constantly get to try out new things and have to figure out how to solve the little puzzles.It's a little like a tech demo, a sales pitch. It goes through many mechanics, you constantly learn to use them more and combine what you learned and then you reach the end.It's not that long.But it does it all so much better than many other VR ""games"" I've tried, at a very reasonable price!And I hope to see some of the mechanics this game tries out in future games as well.Like phyiscally walking down a narrow path and not touching the edges for example. That just doesn't feel the same sitting in front of a monitor!Totally recommended to try out!"

You have enveloping domes that spin around you from the beginning, a drone shooting a green laser grid, and every menu has motion in the backdrop. All of these motions cause motion sickness, and none of them are needed. A static menu, no smoke or backdrop movement is needed at all. I will grant you used the correct form of motion in that of blink, but the other motion in the staging area and menus are just unnecessary."

The user interface in this game is sleek and modern.  The introduction to challenges were engaging. The control scheme is very clearly explained to you all through the first level. Has both teleport and sliding movement options.

Very simple, not much actual gameplay to speak of.  Teleport mechanics are inconsistent at best and constantly remind you that you're wearing a VR headset by virtue of forcing you to work around the limitations of your space.  The ""teleport here GO"" minigame is interesting the first time, frustrating the second, and downright annoying after that.  Teleporting to beacons would seem a fine mechanic if it didn't also randomly re-orient your space for you--just bring me there in the direction I'm still facing!  There are massive arrows you can't get rid of telling you which way is the ""front"" of your playspace, but I'm really unsure why it should matter.  That's not the sort of thing I want to have to worry about, and it shatters immersion.Controls are also rather strange, although the ""hold your controllers close to your face"" mechanic is nice.The story seems rather bolted on after the fact, not helped by the fact that you get tossed out to a level select screen after every level.  Why can't it just take me into the next level automatically?Unfortunately, I cannot recommend at this time."
,Not Recommended,457340,31830789,Posted: 18 May,all,Darmok,"Expected to like this game, but it wasn't very good.I got the sense that there was some sort of attempt at a plot, but sorta felt like I was ""along for the ride"" and the plot was unfolding elsewhere and these floating robots were occasionally clueing me in.Controls were just sorta obscure and weird.Teleporting is often done by obscuring the entire play area while movement happens, which is really slow and annoying.Sometimes you get somehow misaligned from the center of your place space, and the whole thing goes white 'til you fix it.  This happens far too often and seemingly for no good reason."

Yeah the puzzles are easy enough, and the grahics are very basic.  But considering this is in early acces, its very impressive.I've only played for a short while, so far a big thumbs up.  Play the demo, and see what you think, its free!"

,Recommended,457340,24679624,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,CorreAktor,"I've only done two levels but I can already tell that this is going to be my favorite game in VR. The use of room scale, even with the minimum space, is great and they make use of forcing you to move around. It is on-par with Portal VR and The Gallery: Call of the Starseed as far as polish, which are the two top games in my opinion. This may edge them out.One update, level 3 is very annoying, so if the remaining levels are like it, I will be changing this to not recommend. Going between walking and moving the space while trying to get something to move is not good, as I was about to get the task complete only to run into the physical wall."
76561198058844292,Recommended,457340,24267615,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Viveacious,"Mr. Developer, you have a winner on your hands here.I've been keeping up with Dimensional for a while now.  Watching it played, I became interested.  I'm here to say, however, that the visuals are much better than what you see in the videos (if you have a 1080 crank those settings up to 'Highest' and watch the texture detail jump out at you and all aliasing disappear), and the game is very fun to play.  The combination of room scale, navigating through traps, scaling up and down rooms, and leveraging Digby to help you along your journey is a winning formula.The atmosphere is convincing.. it feels as if you're really there.  The menus are well done.  The room calibration during initial setup was a good idea to keep some of us from killing ourselves due to our boundaries being a little off.Very pleasantly surprised.. this thing is a steal at $4.99.  A well-polished game for early access.  Can't wait to see what else Mr. Developer adds in."
