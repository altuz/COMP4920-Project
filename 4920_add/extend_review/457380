Whilst the future game looks like it could be promising i feel charging for such a small sample of the game is unfair & not good value. If your gonna buy it i suggest you put an egg on to boil, it'll be perfect when you finish."

It's cool but a bit short.The hands in game are not in the same position as my hands irl. it's as if they are positioned on top (the round part) of the vive controllers. very weird and no menu to adjust.there are alot of cool pictures in the preview video, but you won't see any of it in this demo. only the snow part. Gameplay graphics are ok but nothing special. not like the pictures in the video. so after seeing it and downloading while being hyped i felt a bit dissapointed after..still very curious to see some other chapters.Please fix the hand position.."

In fact to be honest it's a little cheeky to be charging for what is offered here. It's very, very short with little to do. It looks like it is going to be a series of connected puzzle-room type set pieces. Worth keeping an eye on this as it develops but I couldn't honestly recommend that anyone part with cash for it just yet."

This played more like a demo than a full episode but I did thoroughly enjoy myself while playing.The puzzles weren't overly complex but with the time crunch on they were difficult enough to have you rushing to find a solution.It's half the price of a morning Starbucks coffee and will last you about the same amount of time and probably be more satisfying. (Bad analogy, not a coffee fan. Oh well.)The ending leaves you teased at a much deeper story and i hope to see more episodes out soon though I hope there's more content per episode."

Short, but very sweet. With the time running out, the frostbitten hands getting worse, and the character mumbling to himself gives you perfect sense of your impending popsiclization. Never experienced cold in a 'puter game since Penumbra Overture. I wish you could have experienced the inside of the cabin before the game ends.Like you sit down on the couch, and then a samsquantch comes in and eats you.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=896713089"
,Recommended,457380,30835892,Posted: 30 March,all,Neuvron - Virtual Reality,"You enter a snowy and stormy environment and you have to survive. In order to do so, you have to solve a couple of puzzles.Let's start with the price. Only $1.99. So the price corresponds well with the amount of play you get. Somewhere the developers need to put food on the table just like everyone else. We feel the price tag is well deserved. You get roughly 10 minutes of gameplay. This actually makes the game only playable once. Because, when you have figured out the puzzles, how to survive, you probably won't play the game again.But that is probably the developers thought: to be a one time experience, so with that said, 2 dollars is worth it. It shouldn't be more. So this game is great for new players or maybe letting others try it out to get a nice VR experience.The graphics and the gameplay was fine to. You teleport like most games and interact with objects. And the object interactions were good. We don't want to spoil anything here.Summary: Worth the price, a game you play once (if you don't die ofc), good for beginners or letting others try who haven't played the game before. It's not really a group game because once you know the solution it's over. But we believe this is the developers thought, and it makes sense. We are pretty sure this is more of a taste of what's coming, more developed puzzles.And the idea of fightning against time is a great stress factor!Watch us play it here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uXPjJWeHzg"
76561198015339281,Recommended,457380,30869139,Posted: 31 March,all,Arthands,"Storm VR is an episodic puzzle title, that features roughly 15-30 minutes of gameplay (your mileage may vary). This title is set in an outdoor venue that's having a wild storm, and your objective is to survive. There are a couple of fetch quests and light puzzles around, and the actions are executed by motions too.In this game, your gameplay is constraint by a rather short time limit, and its easy to die as a result. Every time you play however, you learn more about the game and the solutions, thus increase your chance of survival in subsequent attempt (it took me 3 tries to finally clear it).The game is rather atmospheric, and the increasingly fast beeping sound on the watch really makes you feel anxious, if you haven't felt so from the storms around you. You move by teleportation, and you really have to make use of your surroundings to make sure you are not lost from the storm. That and couple with the awesome voice acting, really heighten the tension of the game.The price tag fits the game time well enough. If you are looking for a bit size title, you should consider it. This is just a prelude to bigger things to come (there will be more episode according to the developer)."

I liked the puzzle solving and the atmosphere as well as the voice acting. Unfortunately I was unable to finish the seemingly short experience due to my hands not being able to reach some items. I'm pretty tall so I guess it offset from the position you thought the player would be at. I suggest putting raycast in the hands to reach faraway items or just making the area in which your hands can grab items bigger.Looking forward to the next one!"

,Recommended,457380,29334719,Posted: 18 January,all,JadeK,"Storm VR is a survival game in which the player faces a snowstorm in this first episode, ‘Snowstorm’. Another episodic experience in VR but not at all predictable. Somehow it manages to strike the perfect balance between giving the player the unique cinematic experience that only VR can offer, whilst simultaneously involving the player so that they feel like an active participant AT ALL TIMES in the game, as opposed to an onlooker watching a film. Made by a small team, it really is spectacular for what it offers. STORM VR is just the first episode of what looks set to be an exciting series, and leaves you on the edge of your seat wanting more.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7qOJxVdrRM"

,Recommended,457380,28701319,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Baphomet,Storm VR is a quick and cheap VR experience that plays like the antithesis of an “Escape the Room” game. You’re actually trying to get into a room this time to escape the deadly cold outside and you have a time limit before you die of hypothermia. There are a few simple puzzles to solve and that's about it and the production quality is nice. Not bad for $2.

After 10 minutes or something the puzzle is resolved - I had to start over - and the game accomplished. Since it is 99 cents on sale, you can't do anything wrong, if you just need another VR game to quickly show your audience and friends the power of VR. Don't expect a real adventure though. Don't expect any replayability.Recommended for show purposes only."

(OCed GTX1070.)It is just a few ugly trees, a low detail car/house, very low view distance and a few snowflakes.It really isn't that much more. Should have been a free demo but of course I gladly paid the developers for the effort,hoping more would follow. But since purchase, nothing has changed.However the Storm VR has just been updated... with Oculus Rift touch support. Like this was something we waiting customers were waiting for..  It looks like the developers are happy with how Storm VR turned out and they are working on the next title. In my opinion there are quite a lot of things to improve and fix in Storm VR. Or even expand it just a LITTLE, in appreciation to the people who have already bought their experience. But no...Simply impossible to recommend this."
