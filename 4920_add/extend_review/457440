I didn't even figure out some of the abilities (you get 2 per run which sometimes aren't useful or have nearly infinite cooldowns).There are different mazes which are always exactly the same. The second one was bugged (at least for me) because an arrow kept shooting me straight into the ceiling instead of the platform which made me fall into my death (and no, that's not intended, because sometimes it actually worked).The graphics are nice and the game is somewhat funny, but if you don't like games which consist only of mazes and/or extremely loud jumpscares, keep your hands off this game.There is basically no content except for repeating the same two mazes with maybe different special abilities, so I don't see how this game lost its Early Access status.Don't get fooled by the trailer and the screenshots, it's neither a jump 'n run nor a stealth game nor a horror game."

Just as good as in the screenshots and when i first started the game i thought the russians who made this game mistook how much a euro was worth.I ran around a bit, parkouring if thats what you want to call running and jumping. Then i encountered a monster. The sound of the monster was like 3x the other sounds of the game which is not a good thing. The monster was behind an iron barred fence and kind of just stood still. No standing animation or anything, just completely still. I moved i bit to the left, and so did it. Moved a bit to the right, and so did it. It follows my movements with programing so simple i longed for the refund. There was a small ledge which it had to jump over to get to me, however it couldnt. Three monsters there are in this game, and only one is interesting. The TV guy which can be seen in one of the trailers. The other monsters are a lizardman (which was the one that screeched) and a human with green eyes, both of which seem terribly out of place. Overall the graphics are amazing but the gameplay is awful. Not worth the money.Hyped for getting my money back."

And most power ups you can get don't seem to do anything.- Game isn't remotely scary because it's too dumb and most of the 'monsters' are men in pants...- Totally silly and jokey nothing about it is near funny.I know it's like 2 quid...

,Recommended,457440,24432005,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,CrazyCanuck,"OverviewThe Running Man in space is the best way I can think to describeWatch This!, a sci-fi, horror’ish game that has you running through a space maze, avoiding obstacles and collecting coins, with the goal of getting your family to like you enough to help you escape.And how do you get your family to like you? By buying them items, of course! Perhaps a dinner. Or a game system. Because nothing says “I love you and please don’t let me die” like a video game.You begin in a random room, with a camera on you, where it is safe. This room changes every time, but there aren’t a lot of different spots to spawn, so it’ll become pretty obvious where you are rather quickly. And like the room itself, the maze doesn’t seem to change (at least from what I’ve told). If you spawn in a particular room, take a left, then two rights, then two lefts and you wind up in a room with a pool of water, then that will always be where you end up. There is no procedural generation here.The game looks very nice. It’s nothing to write home about, but the graphics do the game justice. Lights sparkle and reflect, coins have a neat shimmer to them. Sound is a similar story. You can pick up on environmental sounds pretty easily, and will be able to tell if the enemy you hear is to your left, right, or if he’s behind you and you’re dead. The announcer is very annoying. I imagine he’s supposed to be extremely over the top, but it just becomes grating. Controlling your character is simple enough, but the game does feel stiff at certain parts, especially when jumping off from the top of a ladder.Once you’ve collected enough coins, you can buy items for your family at one of the panels spread throughout the maze. Each subsequent item will cost more than the one before it. Once you’ve gotten a family member on your side, you then work on escaping the maze. Obstacles in your way will be water (because really, what would a platformer be where the character is incapable of swimming?), spikes that push down from the ceiling, spike pits, fleshy monsters, and monsters with a television for a head.You’ll be able to collect drinks to restore your health and hamburgers for I don’t know what purpose. You can’t eat them, and when I throw them at enemies, they do nothing. Good chance there’s a purpose to them and I’m just being dumb. You’ll also be able to collect two powerups which will be random. The panel that gives you these look like it’s going to be a memory match game, but whatever two cards you flip over are what your specials will be, and that’s it; those will be your options until you die or escape.Family generation is probably one of the “best” features. Before every game, you’re shown a picture of your family, which is randomly generated. My favorite, by far, was having Doc Brown as my father, a woman in a hijab as my mother, some trashy looking Kardashian (so any Kardashian, really) as my wife, and Kim Jong-Un as my son. Family dysfunction at its best.ProsInteresting concept with a ridiculous storyExcellent visualsFast paced gameplaySlight replaybility in terms of powerups and spawn locationCheap, and has trading cardsConsNot much replayability, as once you’ve escaped, you’ve seen what the game offersOccasionally stiff controlsExtremely annoying announcerSummaryWatch This!is well worth its asking price. It’s a fun jaunt through the maze, avoiding enemies and obstacles designed to kill you horrifically, but it’s over rather quick, and doesn’t have much incentive to do it again. Still in early access, I see a lot of potential for this to expand into something much more, and will be following the game’s progress. Pick it up! It’s four bucks ($4.49 here in Canuckbuck currency), what have you got to lose?"
,Not Recommended,457440,25685813,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Conflagrated,"The game features an announcer with an accent that is difficult to parse, and is quite obnoxious to attempt to decipher while you're fighting the floaty jumping controls and massive player movement component hitbox off the edge so you can hit a bumper without banging your head into the spikes on the ceiling.Maze is  claustrophobic in the worst way, with little room to maneveour sideways it's easy to get hung up on monsters you were trying to avoid, and get stuck  inside of them - unable to prevent your health from melting away.Certain mechanics are very nebulous or poorly explained. You only get two 'powers' on each run, but this can be tricky to figure out, as the machines that dispense your powers don't power off or do anything to acknowledge that's all you get.Enemies can see you through walls at seemingly random, picking up the 'pursuit' music and possibly startling you off whatever platforming you're trying to accomplish.The platforming itself is a chore, thanks to the aformentioned default Unreal Engine 4 player movement component. It's floaty, and your player is way larger than they need to be, making careful movements tricky.The horror aspect is just loud noises and creatures that path around 1xN hallways in a fixed maze while you buy your randomly generated family presents.Cool idea, but overall finds itself crowded, clunky, and generally frustrating. First-person platforming games need a whole level of care on their own - Putting the player in a tight area isn't doing you any favors."

I'm sure there are others who love it, but I just don't.I feel like this game is a lot of wasted potential. It was a fun idea, running through a maze of traps and monsters with an announcer. I guess I was kind of hoping that it would be like Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax from Saints Row.I was really let down. The game is incredibly repetitive, does a poor job of explaining anything, and feels unfinished. Not to mention, it has really long loading screens(even on an SSD!!) with no progress bar so you end feeling like you're being trolled by the game with a giant WATCH THIS loading screen that sits there for up to two minutes making you think the game has frozen."
,Not Recommended,457440,25724365,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,daV,"I bought this game recently purely because I liked the trailer and the graphics shown in there. Plus, I was thinking that for almost 4 bucks you can't go wrong. But don't expect it to be just like in the trailer.I played it a bit and for the first 10-15 mins it was ok, nothing out of the ordinary though. After a while it can become repetitive and annoying. Also, you only have 2 levels to play, 2 mazes so to say which look pretty much the same in terms of content, maybe with a different structure.And when it comes to the horror elements, well I didn't find that. I mean the monsters consist of:Type 1 - A naked guy with his ding-dong hanging outType 2 - A guy dressed in a leather suit, like a BDSM suit (that's what I think)Type 3 - A thing with a TV instead of its faceWhat I like about this game:I like the graphics, I like the sounds and the stupid commentary running in the background, I find the family photos funny, and I like the concept.What I don't like about this game:I don't like the fact that it lacks creativity. I mean yeah, I digg the concept as I mentioned but they didn't build much around the concept, it feels unfinished. I feel they could've made this so much more fun and intense to play.Also another thing I personally don't like, maybe I am just an idiot, is the fact that if you die, you will start right from the beginning. So if you went far ahead and you die, well bad news, you'll spawn right where you started. Some checkpoints or something would've been nice, just my two cents.Even if they have a FAQ, sometimes you don't even know what you have to do, or how to act.Is it worth paying almost 4 bucks?Well, it depends. If you want an intense and scary game with lots of things to do, then NO. If you just want a nice looking game and if you are looking to spend your time somehow, then YES.For me, it's not really worth it because I had higher expectations. I would have been happier if the game had crappier graphics but a much, much better gameplay. I would've paid even more.Even though I gave a thumbs down, I didn't want to ask for a refund, and I won't do that just because I want to support the devs for the concept, not for the execution. Maybe in the future they'll update the game and make it better, just a hope.Here is a short video I did related to this game:https://youtu.be/-nl9IR2Rp8c"

,Recommended,457440,26025002,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,Leon,"I'm going to be a bit lenient with this game, not to the point of giving it an all clear and not talking about the bad points but because it's an indie game and while it's a full release I hope they come back to it to add more maps, more monsters etc. because it need some fixing+additions. As always, this is my opinion as all other reviews are, also there's a TL;DR at the bottom which will have some things that I didn't mention during the rest of it.Alright to get started I thought I'd point out something that causes me great annoyance with games, usually indie games, there is no tutorial. You have to work out everything all by yourself, I mean you can look at the controls in the F.A.Q. on the main page but that prepares you for nothing that you're going to be going through. To escape you need to find both a heart and the door code but to win you also need to buy your family presents so that they'll let you come back home since they sent you here in the first place. The door code won't be something you need to see and remember, you find it as a square pick-up then it's displayed on the bottom of the screen. You will also need to find different keys to unlock different areas colour coded to Blue, Green and Red. There are burgers to throw, their use however remains unknown to me.Second it's a maze based horror game with monsters, pick-ups, ability boosts and traps. The monsters consist of 5 different creatures, one being a TV headed creature that reminds me of the Big Daddy, another looks like an incredibly  angry Fish Man then we have 3 that are similar. There's what looks like other contestants/mutants, people who's eyes and skin have turned a green/brown shade, one of which walks around on patrol (I've only seen it on the second map), another that is found praying to either tv screen or one of the keys you need to access other areas of the maze and finally, a ninja that does the same things as the patrolling mutant. While all of these have the same programming to hunt and kill in a bee line to you which gets boring and easy to exploit (unless one backs you into a corner in which case you're down 1 of 3 lives) I noticed that the Fish Man will attack the Mutants and kill them for you, I don't know if the others have interactions such as these, but I liked it at the time.The graphics are detailed which is something I like, everything looks good and everything feels like it belongs in a space station maze. The controls aren't great but they are very manageable, when jumping you feel like you're floating but you get quite a bit of control in the air so it's not all bad. The sounds are good in general but I'm just going to say, no matter how low you turn this game down, the monster roars (specifically the Fish Man) will be close to deafening. My sound mixer has the game at 1% and in game I turned the only sound option down to nothing (Please add a sound option for general sound, including the monster roars) and it still sounded like it was at 100%.The maps themselves are not very diverse in their rooms, while the game randomly generates the dungeon each time you play. The rooms themselves are very much copied over with not a lot changing from run to run and this could do with a little work but it's not bad, just something I noticed after playing map one 3-4 times. Traps are great, they work as intended but are not unfair, if you're observant then you'll have no trouble with them.Overall I don't think it's a bad game just a game missing a lot of polish and stuffing. It had/has potential and I know it can live up to that but right now it falls a little short.TL;DR+ Graphically looks good+ Abilities to give you an edge+ Controls well, maybe a little ""floaty""+ Traps feel like traps, most of the time you'll die because you didn't see it (jumping into a spiked ceiling)+ Nice twist on the maze escape with having to buy gifts to truly ""escape""+ Fish Man kills mutants for you+ Map Randomisation per run+/- Monster model variety is there, just not differing behaviour+/- Short game times, I've finished maze 1 twice and almost finished maze 2+/- Room uniqueness is low, you'll see the same rooms almost each and every run+/- Monsters are much slower than you and can get stuck on corners every now and again+/- Heart Model can be hard to make out in a dark room missed it once, a light from the thing under it would fix this entirely+/- I've only seen a few abilities in 5-6 runs, slow-mo, speed boost (feels like it does nothing), 3k money and sub-zero (freeze nova)- No tutorial, this is always going to be something that will annoy me because I'm not given any idea of what I can do or what I can work with- No sound option for the monster noises, Fish Man scream is the worst jumpscare you'll come across and it's at 100% volume- Not a lot to do, limited re playability right now. Needs more levels, maybe a level editor could give it some life if that's possible to implement.Summary:Not bad, not good but has the potential to be so, so much more."

I am not sure how much this will end up being an issue (using Iron Man helmet, Predator DvD box, Larry King Live interview with Bill Clinton, etc), but it is worth mentioning.The main focus of the game is to navigate a space station laden with traps and monsters in order to escape. There is currently no tutorial, so I managed to gather that you need to find a Heart of Steel, an access code and purchase enough gifts to make your family happy. If you meet all of these requirements, then you win.Visually the game is a mixture between alright and nauseating do to a feature called Chromatic Aberration. Textures are rather decent and it ran well for the most part. Monster designs are interesting, but ultimately non-threatening. The massive volume spikes when these monsters shriek do more to startle than frighten. Cutscenes are drawn surprisingly well, but it is clear almost every character used for the family is based off a real life person.Gameplay is simple: walk around, gather coins, find what you need and get out. The map is small with no map system, making it extremely easy to get lost. The traps are all time or position related and are easily avoided. You can get perks to either hurt or assist you, ranging from a super jump to a random teleportation. Coffee is also supplied to restore health you have lost on the current heart and cheeseburgers to help lure or distract lesser monsters. I managed to get through it in 15 minutes (after one failed run) and with only one map currently available, it is not much to go on.There are some issues with movement when jumping from ladders or walking over pipes. Monster AI is rather hit and miss with some of them just wandering even after seeing you. The inventory counter only recognizes if you have at least one of an item instead of displaying if you have multiple. For the most part, it works.It is still hard to recommend this title even with the current price tag.

,Recommended,457440,24422023,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Gorgeous Freeman,"Watch This! is an interesting game, the idea of a gameshow featuring someone navigating a maze filled with deathtraps is novel, but Watch This! pulls it off so well.Running on the Unreal 4 engine, the game looks and sounds incredible, looking almost exactly the same as the screenshots on the store page. The sound design is fantastic and really sets up the atmosphere of being on a spacestation, metal floors clank as you walk over them, saws buzzing and spinning at fast speed, screeches of the monsters when they spot you. It's all beautifully done.The maze is somewhat randomly generated, the general layout stays the same but certain objects will move, adding some replay value, more on this later.You are given three ""lives"" and all of the traps, saws, spikes etc. are an instant kill, returning you to the start of the maze. Monsters  will usually kill you in three hits, health can be restored by drinking coffee found around the station however this will not regenerate lost hearts, although this isn't explained so I drank them anyway so when I really needed the health, there weren't many more to find. More on this later.Burgers can be used as bait it seems but normally the monsters don't really seem to care about them, even if I throw them directly at them, I could be wrong about this but again it isn't explained.Monsters are pretty silly, but in a good way, you have that weird fish thing, straight out of a horror movie, some sort of evil cthulhu monster with a TV for a face and these weird zombie things that kind of look like desiccated corpses. The fishy thing is the worst as his screech is extremely loud and he always gets me because just outta nowhere there's this really loud noise, of course you'll jump.You can pickup money from the maze to buy gifts for your family, the game randomly generates you a family at the begginning of each game. To make them want to let you out of the maze. Some family members are real world celebrities others are characters out of films and some are entirely random. Some of the combinations are pretty funny, like my father being Vladimir Putin, my mother being Hilary Clinton, My wife or honey being an alien with three breasts and my son being Kim Jong-Un.You can also find bonuses and these can help or hinder you in someway, although you can only choose two and you keep these for the entire game, only picking new ones when you die and start over. There's no real strategy for picking these, they're flipped over and randomized so it's just down to luck. An option to get rid of one and pick another would be a good addition.It is a good game as of now and there's only been one patch so far but this is a good example of an EA game. It's got the base right and now it needs to build up more features and such. Some things are needed such as:An option to regenerate the maze, playing through the same maze is boring, you start to learn where everything is or will be. A button to completely regenerate the maze would aid in improving replayability.The option to turn down the screechs of the monsters, they are incredibly loud and always catch me, and I'm sure others off guard.Multiplayer would also benefit this game, maybe make it a who can escape fastest or something, and you can choose if you want to help, or hinder the other players.And as I mentioned before, an option to remove one of your bonuses and pick a new one would be good. Maybe you have to pay $100 and the cost increases each time you do it, making you think about wether you want to swap it out.Lastly, a tutorial of somesort is needed as the game doesn't explain what the items do or anything like that, and you're left to work out what stuff does through trial and error.However, this is still a good game, it just needs time to get the features and the polish done right, and it's cheap at just £2.79. Overall, I'd give it a solid 8/10."

Is basically a first person maze navigator with a very cool presentation and a heavy inspiration from Lovecraft for its monsters.  The game is rather short but it's also very low priced for the quality.You're thrown in a sort of industrial/game show maze where you need to find three keys and a ""heart"" object, as well as be expected to purchase gifts for your family.  There are pretty crazy traps all around and you mostly die from one hit from them, with few exceptions as well as some monsters who simply injure you.  You get money from pretty much everywhere and get to pick two random powers that range between ""meh"" to really, really useful.Graphics are very polished and smooth, controls are responsive and most of the enemy encounters are about playing sneak on the monsters.  There are some voices more or less constantly berating you, it's not pro work and you can tell whoever recorded it wasn't a native english speaker but it does a decent job.The monsters are pretty creepy, there's a sort of Star Spawn with a TV instead of a face, cultists worshipping a TV and a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Deep One lurking around.  The rest are all about traps of all kind.  There's a good attention to details and no two room feel identical, so navigating isn't much of an issue after a few deaths.It's cheap, it's fun and the devs really listen to the feedback, so I'd say go ahead and get this if you want something really original."

It's very simple, yet really entertaining! Even though the maze isn't randomly generated, the game still has huge replayability because the mazes are enormous, and you always spawn in a different section.

Here one of them:GAME's NAME:Three black felons and a little, sweet girl...ABOUT GAME:Five passengers travel in the last railway carriage of night train... In the end of the car sat a grandmother and her 15 year old granddaughter. Near them sit 2 fearsome big black men and about something loudly talk. Suspicious black old man sits at the end of the car, which is a bit concerned and quietly talking to himself. Nothing boded trouble, but suddenly grandmother got an attack of diarrhea. Uttering eerie sounds, she ran away with the groaning to the toilet. Three men suddenly fell silent at once, as if already knew each other. Without wasting a minute, an elderly black man deftly close the door from the outside with the help of his crutch. Girl about anything not guess and watch her favorite anime... Suddenly two black men got up and approached the girl. When she lowered her tablet, she saw that they without scruple take off their pants!!! She screams loudly, but no one hears her!!! Oh, she's smarter than is possible to imagine! She erupts past two black criminals! She gets up and runs to the door, her grandmother moral supported from the toilet!!! YES YEAAAAAAASSSS!!!! She almost near the door!!! Oh no... Old black man suited to this door... and... He closes it. Again... The girl falls to the ground. Hope fades in her eyes ... What a despair!!! Oh no ... no ...

,Recommended,457440,34078721,Posted: 7 August,all,Punished Bump,"For the price I actually found this game to be a nice little experience, though to be honest the claim of replayability definitely seems innaccurate.There's two playable mazes. One has a more open, non-linear feel, with the three keys placed in multiple locations, as well as a number of branching paths that really give you the feel that you're finding your way out of the labyrinth, and it's definitely fun getting past the various hazards or deciding to look for another means of getting where you want to go.The other is a bit more restrictive in what order you need to go through things in order to progress, with only one of each key, and you having to grab them in a set order. The abilities you randomly get are varried and it can be fun figuring out what each one does when you first get it ala roguelites, but since the mazes are largely preset you likely won't find them to be enough of a reason to replay the game, and each maze only takes a little over an hour to clear.While the monsters seem to be premade assets (the Tv-Cthulu seems to be the one truly original part of the game), and they really only follow the Amnesia stereotype of ""if they see you they run towards you to hit you"" they took the time to program everything well enough that it isn't jarring, you aren't left with the ""stapled together"" feel that you'd get from say, a Digital Homicide game.Also sidenote before I forget, the comedy is pretty hit-or-miss. They certainly got the sleazy show host stereotype they were going for, and there's some comedic appreciation in that, but the voice lines themselves leave something to be desired.The most important part, I think, is that unlike your shovelware asset flippers, it's clear these devs are actually trying to make something that qualifies as decent on the shoestring budget they have available, and they aren't trying to charge a price disproportionate to the content present, so if you have a few bucks to spare for a neat little indie horror game, it's worth the consideration.7.8/10"

I cannot get this game running at all. I have tried 2 different computers and neither could get the game working. What keeps happening is the game launches, shows the unreal engine, then shows the starting video. Then a glimpse of the main menu before it goes to black. I should mention the entire time the game's sound continues to play.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT STRAIGHT UP DOESN'T WORK!What a waste of £2.79."
