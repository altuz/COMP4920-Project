,Recommended,457480,22696311,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,Tero,"Wow. The only reason I found this game was through crafting a few Steam Badges and getting a Coupon for this game. Now, to be honest, the games they give coupons for are not so great. But, I do always look at the games I get coupons for. This game, casually look at the trailer, looks like a fun little indie game, decide to get it for $1.99. I download it, takes around 2 minutes, and launch it.In the launch, it asks me what graphics and resolution I want. That's a plus. I choose my settings, BOOM! Play the first few level, very simple, a good game to chill out to with some great music choices. Btw, I know I'm a terrible reviewer :PPROS:~Simple Concept~Steam Achievments~Steam Badges~Very Nice Music~Has Different Skins for your personal enjoyment~Great Price~For the price, a very good amount of levels~Steam Achievment pictures are nice for showcases~PHYSICS BRO!?~Just Quality in all aspectsCONS:~So far (a few hours into the game) I have not found any problems in the game.Thanks for reading my review! Have a good day :)"

There's no achievements associated with the last two levels, though.Pros/Cons:+ Surprisingly good controls.  Mouse wheel is for rotation.  WASD moves the camera.  Space/shift raises and lowers.  It's all very fluid.+ Oddly satisfying gameplay.  There's nothing quite like toppling over a line of dominoes without having to pick them back up.+ Unlockable patterns for the dominoes.+ Free play mode.+ Fun mechanics (ramps, balls, etc.)+ The domino limit per each level is rather lenient, allowing for a casual challenge.- I experienced some issues with the framerate dropping every so often-- not enough to discourage me from playing, but still annoying.- Sometimes the physics were a little janky.  For example, I'd fail a level then retry(with no changes) and somehow win.- Restarting a level after a failed attempt would sometimes leave a stray domino that I'd deleted earlier.- Some levels seemed entirely based on luck.- You cannot stack dominoes.Overall:Domino Sky was surprisingly fun.  For $3.99, I got ~3 hours of gameplay out of it.  It's not a bad priced given that I did not mess around too much with the free play mode.  Physics puzzlers are always a blast-- especially when the levels are so satisfying to figure out and complete.  Though my troubles with stutters and overall jankiness was frustrating, they didn't quite hinder my enjoyment of this game.  I liked this one.  I'd recommend it."

Good for those wanting to get all the achievements in a game, or those who just want to play with virtual dominoes! Free play mode is open from the start so you can go crazy with your own creations.I wish you could edit the levels themselves in free-play, but for the price I think the game is worth it!"
,Recommended,457480,31176608,Posted: 16 April,all,Jester,"A slightly casual game where you have to position domino-stones to archive something. Physics is pretty distrubing sometimes, kinda random behavior, annoying as hell. However, a 90%-coupon 'forced' me to buy this, I guess I've wouldn't bought this otherwise."
76561198120645127,Recommended,457480,30826444,Posted: 29 March,all,Snake,"Fun+ Free build available from start.+ OST is great while enjoying the game, Sometime its annoying when you try to focus.+ It has 40 level.+ Once you've passed a certain level you will earn access to any color of domino.+ Easy achievement, if you are an achievement perfectionist (didn't know what you call it in english) like me.+ Cheap? well it depends on your currency, i bought this game using coupon.Not Fun- Some level design is not about logic for example : space levels.- Sometime when you retry to use the same domino setup, it use setup before your last execute.- You can't change preset keyboard settings.- Domino physics tends to change extremely frequently, even when you use the same setup your dominos will not falling   with same result.75/100"
,Recommended,457480,27371371,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,yoshiman6464,"This game is a very unique game. The first couple levels are straight forward, but then it gets really challenging. Regardless, I was able to beat all 40 of the levels in less than four hours of gameplay. I love the customization mode where you can make your own domino creations.I have two problems with this game so far. First, the physics tends to change extremely frequently. In other words, if your domino placement doesn't work one time, it could work the next time without any alterations. Second, testing out a Domino set could shift your dominos completely. These problems are especially apparent when you attempt to play the challenging levels.Overall, as a domino enthusiast, this game is really great. However, the game's problems need to be fixed in a next update."
,Recommended,457480,32052065,Posted: 29 May,all,SteevMeem,"I got this game because I crafted a 90% off coupon for it, but I would have very much paid full price and more! Seriously fun just a few levels in, love the fact that the free mode also comes with three different stages. Best indie game I've played in a long time."
,Not Recommended,457480,33755116,Posted: 23 July,all,nujumkey,"A game that takes a really simple concept and tries to build on it over a number of levels. The most fun part of this game is the fact that you get a quite good simulater of domino physics. The problem is, there isn't much depth the game can add to those physics, and so if they aren't constantly adding new mechanics to the game the levels feel repetitive are are a bit too easy. Also the controls were a bit clunky.I enjoyed it for a good 20 minutes, but it's really hard to make knocking down long chains of dominoes interesting after you've done it 5 or 6 times, although if you do enjoy that process of planning out your domino trains there's certainly plenty of levels for you to enjoy."

,Not Recommended,457480,30848268,Posted: 31 March,all,Phonics Wright,"This game starts out pretty good, 20 levels of smooth sailing. Maybe a couple retries, but overall, not too hard. Then, it pulls out the pachinko level, and your life sucks. This is when I realized a glaring issue that ultimately ruins puzzle games. Doing anything, hitting go, change nothing, then hitting go again gives you two different results. I got to level 26 before kinda giving up due to things like that. The game is broken in it's current state, short and simple."

The physics work okay, they are a bit wonkey (same setup can give different outcomes) but a lot better than in other simular games.In my opinion, the game is just long enough but way too easy.I'd say its an advisable game for 6-12 year olds and for those who like to play something simple on the toilet."

Also ran well on my less than stellar machine.  As a kid who owned Domino Rally though, I expected more.  I was hoping for some really crazy stuff that took advantage of the things you can do on a computer that you can't do in reality.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but at the moment I really can't recommend this for more than $1"
