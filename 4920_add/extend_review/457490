It’s a dream of a happy family sharing profound and eternal love. So does it even matter how much of it is true, and how much takes place in the forgetful mind of an old, possibly dying man who often forgets his own wife’s face and name, and the death of an only child? This story is a reminder of how true forgetfulness isn’t in the old, but in those young people who have forgotten that true love can never really end. After all, where would it go that we cannot follow, someday? (And the music is exceptionally nice.)There may be no shortage of those saying that FNLAKN (which is by no means a game, but simply a story that moves at the reader’s own pace) is contrived, designed simply to provoke deep emotion. And it might be hard to argue to some extent, since it does do that very well. But it’s more than that. No doubt the meaning and value of this story resides largely in the heart of each reader, and will be interpreted very differently based on age and life experience. But for one ageing male gamer who married for the right reasons, however mistakenly and briefly, this is a story about the hope that even the simplest memories of love can be eternally (and eventually) redeeming. And that goodness and kindness can be those stepping stones we need to cross that last river. But mostly Forgotten, Not Lost – A Kinetic Novel is a reminder that no matter the number of powerful and sustaining memories age and dementia may take from our daily awareness, in whatever remaining part of our minds we continue to dwell those memories also reside, undiminished.If readers wish to feel the heartbreak of dementia, and understand how too many people currently experience each day of their lives, FNLAKN is an excellent experience. As well, if you wish to understand caretaking of your own elderly family members, now or in the future, and this more regrettable possibility of your own future, again, this is a simple, short and inexpensive way to preview those prospects, in a hopeful manner. Or if you’ve simply lost love, and wish for the reassurance of its possible return, this may prove a very pleasant way to spend some time while warming your heart.Thank you.(4m/s)(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)"

This is totally not my genre, but I picked it up for the topic.  Not my art-style.  Not my choice of general sentiment.  But it's so profoundly praiseworthy for the natural characterization of the main character.Hands down the best first person portrayal of dementia I've seen in any media.A lot of people seem to think that there isn't a person inside the shell of the person with dementia any more because the interfaces are broken.  And for all that this is a treacle-y love story, it really gives you a notion that there is a person inside the broken memory.I took care of my own mother for years after my dad died, in my home.  I'm a rather ancient gamer grrl as such things go -- pushing 60, and in our ethnic culture, it's the youngest daughter's job, and a loving duty.Mom had times where she'd have issues of thinking Dad would come by, particularly before they got her on l-dopa for Lewy Body dementia -- she would set table and cook dinner for the two of them, and then be terribly upset he wouldn't show up and be worried something had happened to him.This story puts something like that into a magical realism/fantasy setting.Generally, we infantilize and disrespect our elders in general American culture (if there is one), but even more our elders with dementia.  We dehumanize them.  They require our compassion doubled and more.  Any one of us could be there in some number of years, and that should drive us to care more, not drive us away.There is something very amazing about old marrieds who are best friends, quite literally forever.  I have a few friends and family that I will never give up on even if I don't see them ever again in this life, whether or not they are still with us.  And those relationships really are the last things that stay with us.And perhaps at some point, when I'm too tight wound and can't let go, this will be the thing I'll come to, to take a wrench to the faucet.  Fair warning.8/10 would feel completely silly crying again instead of killing things, with cheesy 2d anime art, and think it was time well spent."

I wasn't prepared, at all, for reading this.The story is from the point of view of an elderly man with severe, chronic memory loss. I was not prepared for this, because my grandmother suffered from dementia, which caused her to behave in a much similar way. She died last year, and wow, memories of her came flooding back while reading this. My great grandmother had severe Alzheimer's disease before she died as well; though I never met her, I heard many stories about her. It's a very sad, scary illness that I wish had more awareness and more funding for research on how to find a cure for it. Thus, I'm glad this VN exists.I probably would've found the story sad regardless, but knowing someone personally with the same kind of mental illness definitely makes it more emotional."

Now it's too late for me to visit her.I love this game, it made me feel like a horrible person, but I simply didn't have the heart to see my grandmother in such a terrible state. I'm so sorry.The novel's full of simplistic, but still good, symbolism. Such as the different emperors of Memoria (pretty obvious ...), and of course, the characters that the main character interacts with through the story.The ending can be interpreted in different ways, either as an afterlife or the main character's last dream before his death.I recommend this novel if you want to think while reading it, maybe about the past, just like the main character. It can be finished in an hour, maybe even less, but it will be worth it."

The only interaction here consists of clicking the left mouse button, or pressing spacebar from the start to the end of the story. I'd generally categorize this under the 'kinetic novel' category instead of a game. It would be nice too if there's some element of choice in the story, but I understand that would probably blow the budget beyond the cheap price of this game.Being aware of that however, if what you want is an EXPERIENCE, a nice story of how an old couple live together at the end of their lives (and beyond), then by all means, get this kinetic novel. I guarantee that this product comes with tons of chopping onions and will touch you deeply as tears flow -- especially if the characters in the story are people you can relate to. Arts is okay-ish and does the job, the music is excellent! Writing is decent. The nearest equivalent to this would be those $1 indie self-published books in the kindle store, but this one comes with a full multimedia experience of graphics and music too. I play it at night and managed to go through the story in about 30 minutes, and for what I paid, I consider it worth the money. It's also something I will definitely recommend to other people whom I know share the same taste as myself."
,Recommended,457490,25900420,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,☆ AEON ☆ CSGetto.com ☆,"Review originally published athttp://vnvortex.co/2016/04/04/forgotten-not-lost-review/Forgotten, Not Lost is a kinetic visual novel by Afterthought Studios (A More Beautiful World), and it’s available on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux via Steam for $1.99. It includes Steam trading card, but no achievements to collect.Who are you?In this visual novel, the reader takes the role of an old farmer who is suffering from dementia, and is slowly losing more and more of the memories of his wife and child. Due to the shortness of the novel, it’s really hard to go much more into the details in order not to spoil it all, but it’s easy to say that this is one emotionally loaded novel. Depending on one’s reading speed, it will take a little over or under one hour to go through Forgotten, Not Lost. There is no replay value at all.Occasionally it’s easy to lose track of the characters due to the similarity in all of their names, making for some confusing scenarios. One could go and assume that the confusion with the names of the characters happens on purpose, but it can easily sway the reader from the verge of tears to confusion, really eating out the immersion that was being built. But since the author of the story has based it in their own, actual experiences, this could very well be something that just escapes me since I have not had to deal with any sort of memory loss in life – this is to say, the story might resonate more with those who have actual experience with the matter.The art of the game is quite simplistic, but it fits the sorrowful theme very nicely – same can also be said for the music, which complements the whole package neatly. And while I do feel that there could’ve been some more sound effects in some scenes to bring even more life to the experience, it’s not a major downfall.In conclusionForgotten, Not Lost is definitely a decent visual novel, and while it is very short and even quite confusing at times, overall it manages to make itself worthwhile. The price of $1.99 is already not too bad, but later down the road when discounts start to hit it, it can easily be recommended for a short bedtime story."

It deals with dementia and loss. if none of that appeals to you move on. Anyways i won't talk too much about it because you just need to read it. its also cheap to match the length.  anyways we all know how Dementia can destroy lives. it really sucks. anyone who has been around it because of family, friends, or even work knows what this can do a person. so you can relate to this novel."

I got the feeling I couldn't trust any of my perceptions and memories.  Perhaps I felt a little bit of the lostness that someone with dementia experiences constantly.  And perhaps this was by design.  And perhaps this is the greatest first person portrayal of dementia ever done.  It certainly is one of the very few.  Perhaps you won't be as emotionally touched as I was, but it is likely you will deal with someone with dementia in your lifetime, as have I.  So it is something I feel was important that I experienced.  It will only take an hour of your time and a few dollars."

I was on the verge on tears more than a few times and that testimonies the level of writing behind the game.The VN's setting is of an old couple living in a non-descript village with the old man struggling with his failing memory. It doesn't take too long to figure out things, but the writing is spot on from the old man's POV as he doesn't anything strange until the last few moments of the game. I recommend it for anyone interested in VNs - doesn't take too long and there are no choices, but it's bound to leave a mark for a while after you complete it."

Yes.. even if you are a ""heartless guy""!  Furthermore, I will make it known that I state right now that anyone who can genuinely read this entire short novel and not at least wet an eye simply doesn't have a heart, period.There's nothing more I can add about the story that the details in the description and the preview video don't present better already.

This is a kinetic novel, so there are no choices or inputs of any kind. This works well especially with the theme, dementia and aging, as in a way, the reader feels similarly unable to control what is happening.As for the story itself, I found it to be compelling. It is both sad and hopeful at the same time. The focus isn't so much on what is happening, but how the protagonist experiences it. The lines between memory, dream, and reality get intentionally blurry.The visuals and audio were simple, but appropriately expressive.Overall, I'd recommend the experience. It got a tear or two out of me, and got me to go hug my parents afterward, so it definitely affected me."

Not amazing, but good.Gameplay:Kinetic novels don't really have gameplay, it's just a story, which is fine, and they are often short but this only took me 25 minutes to get through and there is no reason to play it twice. That was only enough time to accrue one of the three trading cards the game provides so if you wish to collect them be prepared to leave this running in the background for a while.Story:The story of an old man with dementia. I appreciate any story which has themes which raise awareness of important things but I actually expected a little more. It started out with promise, he couldn't remember that his daughter was long dead, forgot how to use his knife and it was very poignant but suddenly it's all about ghosts and his impending death and the main theme of the novel gets kind of lost in the shuffle.SPOILERS AHEADIt is obvious what's happening from the get-go, when the spirits of his wife and daughter arrive. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, I just don't think it was done as well as it could have been. I have to say, his daughter wearing a tomato costume was weird, it was meant to be cute and had a little story behind it but I can't help think that literally anything else would have been better because she was dressed as a frikkin' tomato and it made it hard to take it seriously. I also wasn't keen on the fact that the town was called Memoria because that is way too on the nose. It's poor writing.I'm a sucker for tragedy and normally someone going out to find out that their wife has fallen down a hill and died in the night would be gold but in this story it's just pointlessly brutal. The story is meant to be about the man and his life and his dementia and it seemed totally unnecessary to have that as the plot. It's like the story couldn't decide what it wanted to be and so it chose to be everything.+ Hearing about his past and the stories of how he met his wife and the end when they promise they'll be in heaven waiting and he finally passes on and meets them are quite well-done and did make me smile.Writing:+ The writing was good. You won't be blown away but it was very good. I noticed only a single mistake, a missing full stop near the end on one of Maribel's lines.Value For Money:For the price it's not worth it as a good rule of thumb for any game of any genre is £1 per hour of gameplay. If you can get this for £0.50 or less, that's fine, but I wouldn't spend more.Bottom Line:Don't buy it unless you can get it for less than 50p. If you can, expect a half hour of a cute story with many flaws which will make you smile by the end but then be forgotten pretty soon."

Especially the backgrounds, well done. I also like the music as well, it fits the moods well(though it gets kind of sporadic and repetitive, still good).I also admit that it's a tough and noble thing to tackle the issues of mental illness and trying to fit the reader into the shoes of such a person. I think we need more stories like this in that manner.Having said that, I can't recommend you pay any sort of money for this novel, for the following reasons:1. The story does not do the topic justice. It's confusing, goes nowhere, nothing happens, nobody changes or learns, and the ending is predictable and boring.2. The charatcers are confusing as all get-out. And boring. Not fleshed out at all.3. The story was definitely padded with the same thing over and over again (i.e., character recalls something, character's wife reminds him that so and so died, character accepts as the truth, pats daughter's head). This happens ad nauseum throughout the story.4. The music and audio inconsistencies. Music randomly cuts in and out, sound effects are random.5. Spelling and grammar. Did you proof-read this? And is it Madaline or Madeline? It keeps changing in the story making it quite discombobulating.6. Some of your character prompts were broken (i.e., lines spoken by the wife not displaying their name, meaning that it looks like the main character is speaking it.)In the end, this is a noble freshman effort which lacks polish or any decent story. There are bits where it does shine, but it beats you over the head with them so many time you wish you didn't bother.I would recommend to Afterthought Studios that you up your writing game, or get another writer. I think you could have great potential, but until you have a good story, it will be difficult to ewach that potential."

I got to an hour, after going back a few times because I had accidentally skipped a 'page'.I feel like I would play it again just to grasp the entire purpose of the story better, but not now, right after I finished, as it is one of those things that you need to take a break from.I'm not sure why it has so many saving slots as it has no choices or changes.I am on one hand quite disappointed that the ending was the way it was. I believe there could have been more.Also I feel like it would have been better to buy it in a sale, but it was worth it for me.Even though it was short it felt very fleshed out for me and I felt for the characters. It made me cry a little. I've read a book with a similar story (for the Dutch speaking people that are interested: Hersenschimmen by Bernlef) and I liked these characters more, perhaps because of the time and place this game was set in.The random Mayor, though, was kind of weird. I get why, but they could have made it less weird. Like I said, the ending could have been dealt with better in my opinion.If your looking for a sad story that makes you smils and you've watched all the good movies already, this is definitely a steal."

With very simple visuals, music, and writing this game reaches into your chest and rips out your heart, mostly if you've ever known anyone who suffered from dementia and/or Alzheimer’s. If you have the few extra bucks and half an hour do play this game and be ready for the feels."
