That's my situation; I can't muster up the interest in more than two or three large games a year, if that.  Aging sucks, huh?But you know what I'm always hungry for?  A cheap, short, medium-hard indie that, as Mellencamp sings,  will ""thrill me, and then go away.""  This here is the very definition, dear friends!  It's nice to look at, it's challenging, and the gameplay is as smooth as Kentucky creek rock.  And did I say it was cheap?  So very cheap?A little shot of something strong to keep the harried tricenarians among us going!"
,Recommended,457520,22927053,"Posted: 12 May, 2016",all,Twistor,"Super Moustache Man and the quest for the magical moustache gelTL;DR:Moustache Mountainis a short but challenging platformer.InMoustache Mountainyou play as a jumpy, athletic guy who has a moustache (that sound oddly familiar?) and a simple quest: go onward and reach the top of the mountain. Graphics are indie-minimalistic but fine at that, and the funky 8-bit-like music fits the game like Super to Mario.Gameplay is simple enough. Each level is just one screen and your job is to reach the right side of it. To do this you may run (with a constant pace as there is no boost), jump, climb and wall-jump all the while avoiding traps. Initially I thought there might be some secret areas or collectables in the hard-to-reach parts of the levels, but alas, it really boils down to reaching the other side of the level.Controls are slick and work perfectly. You can play with either keyboard or controller (I used the latter). The only shaky thing is the wall-jumping that only seems to work when moving towards the wall at the same time as you jump, which is inconvenient when you have to try and jump to an overhanging ledge but matters little when you just want to climb. In comparison the movement mechanics are almost the same as in e.g.Super Meat BoyorA Walk in the Dark.Nooo, not the spikes!While those games are admittedly more difficult (and longer), there's challenge inMoustache Mountain. Initial levels are just simple parkour challenges but soon enough the levels become filled with deadly spikes, dart traps and cleavers. You have only three lives and once they are spent, it's game over. At least there are no generic saw blades!That sounds pretty bad though, right? No one has time for starting over these days. But wait, actuallyMoustache Mountainis really short. With only 15 levels the game can be beaten in under 3 minutes. There's even an achievement for that. And thankfully the hitboxes are quite generous so you know most your deaths will be your own fault. Isn't that conforting?To counter the eventual repetition,Moustache Mountainhas a trick to shake things up and keep it fresh: there are more levels than it initially appears. While a single run has only 15 levels of increasing difficulty, the level roster changes between runs and effectively there are something like 50 different levels. All the levels become familiar as dying is easy in any level that you haven't played before. I think this was a neat way to expand the game.That said, I would have liked to practice specific levels more without having to play through the whole game before randomly running into them. A sort of practice mode would have been a nice addition, although after a few tries even the more difficult levels become beatable.ConclusionsIt's a pity that even with the rotating levelsMoustache Mountaintook me only something like 40 runs to complete (both without dying and under 3 minutes), amounting to about 1.5 hours. Interestingly I can see that the challenge could be too much for some people: the less you've played platformers, the longer effective playtime it offers. You can also compete on the leaderboards for the shortest runs.By the way: There's a local co-op mode though I didn't try it. However it seems that some of the later levels might be more difficult in co-op because of the reactive traps. Hard to say whether that's a good or a bad thing though it might add some randomness and fun to the soup.For a game that costs 2 € it has an okay amount of content. It has Steam cards too to sweeten the deal. If you like platformers go ahead and buy it to get a quick snack."

Take super meat boy, remove 95% of the content, and give the player 3 lives to complete the game and you have Moustache Mountain. I wanted to like this game so bad. It is just that the charm of the game is purely in its visuals... also it has ""Moustache"" in the title. I guess it is impressive for the sale price of $0.49 that I picked it up for, but I just had such high hopes."
,Recommended,457520,33408876,Posted: 9 July,all,t. mike,"Moustache Mountain is a fun little $2 time-killer. The smooth and simple platforming mechanics carry right over from Amatniek's previous game, There was a Caveman: with limited controls including movement and jumping, and bouncing off walls being about the most complex these moustaches get.As a tiny (but burly) man with a moustache, you platform your way up 15 single-screen levels with increasing difficulty and traps. Heaps of bloody spikes, player-activated arrow traps, shifting blades and narrow platforming -- your goal is simply to make it to the right side of each screen without losing three lives.A single, successful game should only take between three and five minutes, but it'll likely take up to an hour to get there the first time. To keep things interesting, each screen is pulled randomly from a handful of options (except level 11, which always seems to be the same).As with Nauris' other solo projects, the music is the dreariest boops and bops of anti-music, easily making it the game's weakest aspect.Moustache Mountain doesn't come with much, but it's a fun project easily worth the measly price tag it carries. I also recommend following the developer on Twitter / Patreon (@namatnieks), where he actively creates gorgeous pixel art and tutorials. :)~"
,Recommended,457520,29393442,Posted: 21 January,all,Solty D,"Moustache Mountain is an entertaining, quick game that follows the adventures of a gentleman with a sweet moustache and his quest up a mountain for glory and moustache gel while avoiding pits, arrows, spears, spikes, and knives. It's an easy game to pick up and play for just a couple of minutes and while the ride is over quickly, it's fun while it lasts.The game itself takes place over 15 single-screen levels where the object is simply to get to the right edge of the screen and the aforementioned traps will try to kill the player. The levels ramp up slowly in difficulty and are randomly picked from a pool of 30-40 stages, so even after finishing there is replayability in seeing some of the other levels, as well as a Steam leaderboard that records the fastest times up the mountain.The graphics are good, clean pixel art that get the job done. Most dangers are obvious, with spear traps being a bit harder to see. After a couple of playthroughs, however, the player will quickly learn where they are anyway. There are whimsical touches like the lives counter having moustaches with the current life adding a little extra wiggle. There are windowed and fullscreen modes, but the window can't be resized and is really quite small. For higher resolution monitors, fullscreen is the only way to go. A scaling window is the one feature I felt was lacking here.The sounds get the job done without frills (it's a budget indie game after all, frills are extra). What music there is is fine, but there's only one track so be ready with your own playlist if you'll be playing for any significant length of time. The controls are solid and responsive, critical in a game where the only moves are jumping and wall-jumping.In short, the game does what it does well and delivers a fun distraction for a few minutes without promising any more. It's challenging, it's enjoyable, it provides some replayability and doesn't overstay its welcome. Moustache Mountain is well worth the price of admission for a little casual gaming."
,Not Recommended,457520,26721528,"Posted: 20 November, 2016",all,Vantier,"What I liked-The game looks and feels polished-It has leaderboards for speedrunning-It has a decent difficulty curveWhat I disliked-The Leaderboards are ruined by the fact that the 15 levels you play are randomly selected, which means on top of playing perfectly, you also have to just get lucky with the level selection.-Game is too short, combined with the flawed leaderboards, and there isnt much replayablity from either a casual or competitive standpoint.Just to make it clear what the full content of the game is, if you can't tell from the videos or screenshots. Each screenshot shows 1 full level of the game. Go through 15 of those screenshots and that is the whole game. Some of the videos might give the impression that the levels are bigger than they are because they are zoomed in and the camera pans to the right. But again, each screenshot shows an entire level.SummaryThe game has a solid foundation and feels like it could have been expanded on and made much better. But at the end of the day it just feels like a 2$ Demo for a full game that doesnt exist. You are better off getting ""Super Meat Boy"" or ""1001 Spikes"". They may be 8x the price of this game (15$), but in the end you will get far more than 8x the content and replayablity. There just isnt enough here to bother with. You're better off saving your 2$ and putting it towards a more complete game."
76561198365236399,Recommended,457520,30069761,Posted: 20 February,all,Awai,"A short and succint platforming game. Lovely pixel art and that is to be commended on. You are navigating a character that is burly + presumably has muscular legs that can propel him very far, but runs a 15 min mile. He is faster jumping/hopping than running...Things that may aggravate you 1) having to restart from the very beginning after 3 mustaches are lost. Perhaps at say level 6, a check point, then level 12 another one? 2) Smoother/more reactive wall jumping. The concept of wall jumping is great as it offers more flexibility and variable game play into a platforming game. But when you wall jump in this game, you almost have to button mash to jump off the wall before you slide off the wall (because you slide very fast - gravity!) and into your most likely death. So it becomes less focusing on how to wall jump to a specific location, but more button mash and hope you make it after that. Although, enough gameplay, this should be remedied. 3) No way to replenish a lost mustache. I finished it with only one lost at the last level, but for the less capable gamer, having a way to replenish a lot life due to a learning mistake or mis-jump later on in the game would be nice. Granted, continuously play throughs will get you used to each map and you will be able to finish the game easily in the end.To note, some of the traps and platforms are seriously hard to see. You really have to pay attention ahead of time or you will end up jumping to a spot and wondering where to go next or recall, ""oh I hear a sound, spikes will come up"". If that is the intended game difficulty, sure got me a few times in the beginning. However, if the game did not intend to have melding graphics with the background, then this would be a thing to improve upon.Randomization - I think it is a nice touch to add this in so you aren't playing the same level over and over again as you try to reach the end. It can be debated if it is truly randomization since each level only shuffles through a selected few intended in that level. What does suck is that if you are attempting achievements (say the 3 min achievement), some stages are more time consuming than others, while others can be more difficult to navigate (if you are attempting the unstoppable achievement say). It'll take various tries and maybe some luck to get a good run in for levels that are not as time consuming or the most difficult to navigate.Overall, a nice game to play as it is a very short game. Simple platforming game with some funny quirks that can be enjoyed by most. IE: one of the later trap is a shaver - a mustache owner's worse nightmare! 7/10."
,Recommended,457520,30530161,Posted: 15 March,all,Warnerrr,"A speedrunner's best friendSeriously, the game has a built in timer, so you don't have to fiddle with splits, it's right there on the screen for you. Sure, for more accurate results, you could also run livesplit, but so far the speedrun community for this game isn't very large, so there aren't any contested runs yet.As for the game itself, its simplicity is where it shines. You can jump, and you can wall jump. That's it. No finicky other buttons to press, just directions and jump. However, the game is not without its flaws. Using a controller, my preferred platforming control method, there is a bit of a problem with the controls. Touching down on the dpad causes you to stop moving entirely. So as you go from left to right or vice versa, you might inadvertently press down as you roll over to the other side, causing you to lose momentum. This could be easily remedied by the developer by either removing that feature, or allowing the player to rebind their keys. However, I don't see that happening, since there are practically no customisation options in the game, having only sound on/off, fullscreen on/off, and vsync on/off.A solid game that I really love, that could use some improvement.7.25/10"
,Recommended,457520,24189086,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Gemini166,"This game is a pretty short, but good, arcade-style platformer.Running feels slow sometimes, but it's just right for the pace of the game. Jumping and wall-jumping are simple and responsive, which is good, because wall-jumping is a significant part of the game.Levels seem to be semi-randomized, andmighthave multiple variations dependent on when you reach them?Gameplay is pretty simple; complete 15 levels without dying 3 times, and you win.I have no friends, and am therefore unable to review local co-op mode, but singleplayer was good.Soundtrack is unintrusive, something that could be easily muted and replaced with your own music, but something that shouldn't compel you to shut it off in fury.Art is pretty nice.High Score boards are available for the competitive.I got this on sale for $1, and I don't regret it.My largest complaints are not with the game itself, but with the Trading Cards/Achievements. I completed every other achievement before I got the 50 New Games achievements, and MUCH before the 100 New Games achievement, so I was left to grind those out by repeatedly exiting to the Title Screen and starting a new game, which was actually pretty quick, so it was less painful than it could've been.I also unlocked EVERY achievement before unlocking all of the only 3 card drops, and this was AFTER I left it idling for about 30mins while I did something else.Overall, though, definitely worth for a $1 game."
,Recommended,457520,25858245,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,716green,"I'm doing a positive rating because I give the developer a lot of credit for creating a platformer that made it to Steam, not because it's unique (because there are countless platformers on Steam) but because the games mechanics are responsive and because and the controls feel right. You can pick the game up with no idea what it is and have it down to a science in minutes. I personally feel that sliding down during the wall-jumps is a little hasty and I read another review that said that as well so if that is addressed there is a better chance I'll come back and play some more.The only REAL flaw, and again this is just my opinion- the 3 lives system is a bit dated. This was a concept created for arcades to determine when it is time for the player to pay to keep playing. These days I feel like the best of the skill based platformers give you unlimited lives. I really think that should be removed. For example, I just played levels 1-12 about 7 times in a row. Now when I go back to play again, I need to re-play those levels again. The first 7 or 8 levels are too easy to really be fun after a few plays.Besides that, it's a lot of fun. Seems to be in the early release stages and will hopefull receive some re-design in the fast wall sliding and the level system but regardless it was very cheap and now I can play it anytime. It's a funny concept and I like that.I'll check back and re-play at some point. I hope it's updated by then to reflect the user feedback. I'm not upset that I bought it. I beleive it will only get better."
,Not Recommended,457520,22453357,"Posted: 16 April, 2016",all,Nameless,"Moustache Mountain is a small platformer featuring a total of 15 single-screen levels (with a couple of variations each), a few different simple mechanics to avoid and... well, not much more. The level design is bland and almost every sprite seems to have been copied and pasted between the stages. There's a single audio loop soundscoring the entire game.Expect about 30 minutes of game play to beat the game and about two hours if you want to clear all the achievements. Even at the low price point of a couple of Euros I think it's a mediocre value proposition at best. I can appreciate the art style but that's about all the game has going for it.If the developer adds a bit of additional content I might revisit my rating but for now there is no way that I could recommend this game."

Your character who does not appear to have a name so I will call him tommy has a mustache. Tommy has a problem a good mustache needs wax to look its best, but his mustache demands only best and storebought will not get the job done. Tommy hears rumors of an ancient mustache wearing race of monks that created mystical mustache gel. The problem they decided to hide it ontop of flying mountain filled with deadly traps for they knew that facial hair grants you ninja like reflexes and they did not want this gel falling into the hands of non mustacheoed normal people.presentationMustache mountain looks like an old school platformer. The level design is well laid out and changes with each playthrough. While the worlds are not randomly generated there are a number of ones predesigned so it will be random on what levels you get.SoundThe sound effects are simple, but fitting of the games art direction. Playing with sound on helps as it alerts you of some traps giving you the time to react.musicThe music is a simple loop that fits for the game style, but gets repetative quickly. The problem with the music is you can not turn it off without also turning off the sound and since the sound helps with reacting to traps you are forced to listen to the music. I would sugest if a future update comes out enabling turning off the music seperate from sound.controlTommy controls perfectly he is a mustache ninja. You are able to play with both a controller or keyboard. The most important mechanic for a platformer is solid control and the developer nailed it with this game. you move and jump fluidly. Since tommy is a mustache ninja he can wall jump to avoid the hazards.DifficultyAs you clear levels the difficulty scales up. Expect to die at least a few times on your way to the top of the mountain. The deaths never feel cheep however if you die its because your reaction time failed to be good enough. after three deaths you must shave your mustache and it is back to the beginning of the game while this might seem harsh it is not bad since if done right you will clear the game in under 6 minutes.endingTommy scales 15 random levels dodges spikes pitfalls and razor blades trying to shave off his mustache. He gets to a giant mustached statue in its mouth the prize of perfect mustache gel. Tommy's mustache assends him to the heavens and he now Lords over all..... or the game goes back to the title screen adn you may start again.bonus contentThe only extra gameplay content in mustache mountain is the option to play local co-op with a friend. I had no access to another mustacheod friend so I do not have a verdict on co-op. There are however achievments to try and collect not to mention with the random level selection this is plenty of replay fun.Final VerdictThis game is fun if you enjoy a good solid platformer in the likes of super meat boy you will most likely enjoy this game. Yes it is insanely short the record for beeting it is just over two minutes, but at a price point of $2 that is perfectly fine. I got this game the night before I did a 10k that I had to be up at 5:30am for I stayed up 40 minutes later then I wanted just saying alright one more time. I am going to be keeping an eye on future games from Nauris AMnatiaks. Mustache mountain gets Jawfins Seal of approval."
