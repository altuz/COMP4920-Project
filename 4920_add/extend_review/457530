,Not Recommended,457530,22539617,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Faudraline,"Here is the dream coming true for a certain kind of otome gamer: now you can pursue your butler as a romantic interest! Interested? Buy the game already, it's for a dollar anyway. Not so much? Skip, 'cause this brief definition is really all that there is to this game, and by using the word ""pursuit"" previously, I already overcharged the concept. The whole VN consists of 5-6 choices and 3 scenes, without any kind of decent story build up. Cute, brief and without much content,My Ladysadly feels like the outline of an Harlequin romance without decent story progression, character depth or even expected romantic exaggeration.You are young Lady Bauxmont, a fair noblewoman of age seventeen and desperately in love with your butler, yet it is not possible for you to be together thanks to the difference in social classes. Age old story aside, you have a tyrant of a mother who'd most surely arrange a marriage with another aristocrat of your age quite soon; thus, you have one last chance to get things into your hand and try to grasp your happiness with the butler. Lemons and oranges as your fateful maid Sophie tells you; lemons and oranges...The game is extremely short and characters are not given any kind of depth at all to actually comment on that quality. You are free to name Miss Bauxmont and the butler as you please - or keep original names, which are Elizabeth and Alexander - to arrange some kind of immersion for the player, but it’s a sad attempt at that really. The chosen art style of faceless figures feel unfittingly eerie and existentialist compared to the flighty mood of the game also. One serious plus is that the game is fully voice acted with good enough acting in the sense, especially for Sophie with her accent, laughter and remarks. The game comes with 5 endings, which are easy to reach yet the choices and their influence in endings are a bit ridiculous. Apparently, the kind of woman you are and what kind of an ending you'd happily pursue is dependent on your choice for the dress color you'd pick to wear that given day. Oh, well... What are you gonna do sometimes?I haven't played the developer's previous game, quite successful and surprisingly freewareSeduce Me the Otomebut apparently it has a truckload of content in it and much replayability compared to this one, so it is frustrating to see the previous game being a freeware and this not. I'm aware that it's a one dollar game and there shouldn't be expected much, yet I'd personally prefer paying forSeduce Me the Otomerather than forMy Lady. With at least some proper story build up between the starting position and one of the endings rather than the abrupt appearance of a suitor we know nothing about, this game could have been much more pleasant or at least interesting. As it is, go buy yourself a can of soda if you don't have an unbearable fetish for butlers - correction: the ""concept"" of butlers since Alexander doesn't bear much personality himself.

The Store page summarizes the plot really well, so i won't go into that (no spoilers here, ur welcome) here.The art is a little different this time, as all of the character models have no face's. However the bodies were drawn well, as were the clothes. Almost old fashioned shadow puppet like (due to missing face's) art, that fit's the story well.The music was good, changing to match the tone of the story at times.A good, cheap VN, that won't last long, but will b enjoyable while it does last."

As pointnclister comments in their review 'a shameless bit of fluff'.  My Lady is that and not apologetic about being fluffly, romantic, a little brazen and just a bit mushy.Runs along the the same theme line of boy and girl from different backgrounds and social status who fall in love with careless disregard to either background or status, yet at the same time both of these things are the defining factor of their romance.  Found the world over in books, movies, and plays like Romeo and Juliet, The Great Gatsby, Slumdog Millionaire, Cinderella, West Side Story, The Man in the Iron Mask, Cyrano de Bergerac, and countless others.  This is pure and simple classical romance.Storyline: Miss Elizabeth Bauxmont (Elizabeth is the default first name), age 17, is in love with her butler Alexander (default name), age 21, and has been awkwardly pursuing him or at least trying to get his attention.  Mother Bauxmont wants to marry off her daughter and has arranged for someone suitable by the name of Isaac Newport.  The entire storyline takes place in one day and one evening with the proverbial sunrise of the next day the conclusion to the romance, in some way or another.  (The whole game, and all the endings take about an hour and half to play, if you do not skip most of the dialogue.)I would venture to guess the time frame to be the mid to late 1800s (because of the horse drawn carriages) and the setting East Coast of the United States (United States because of the word lawyer, East Coast simply due the cosmopolitan ambience, and the fact most people involved are wealthy, not nobility.) This time frame and setting lends to the believability that any of the five endings could actual happen.  ""Happily Ever After"" has many different forms, definitions, and connotations.The voice acting is great.  The writer voice acts the maid.  Everyone speaks but the Main Character (MC).  The player has the option to name both the MC and her butler.  The visual novel aspects give choices to the player, some of which will have a direct bearing on which conclusion to this ""forbidden"" romance between the MC and her butler will occur.  The player is very much in control of the MC and very much takes an active part in the decision making progress.  The player literally choses their ending and is not forced into some ending by the visual novel storyline like so many other visual novels do.The best thing I like about this game is the maturity level of the MC, even more then the believabilty.  The MC is very aware, consciously and personally, about what her choices mean and the ramifications of what she choses.  She is not clueless, naive or dumb.  She is not a damsel in distress or a helpless pawn.  She is fully aware of herself and those around her.  And yes, one can have oranges and lemons, if the circumstances are correct.Highly recommend."

The cost of .99 USD at full price is justified by this playtime.The story is a typical forbidden love romance between a noble woman and her butler. There are multiple good and bad endings. The player makes choices throughout the game which influences their path and eventual ending in a typical visual novel format. Overall the story was relatively satisfying and well paced.The art quality was adequate. The choice to make the characters visually featureless beyond their hair colour and style and clothing is an interesting one, and I suppose it allows the reader to insert themselves into the story beyond naming the main characters. There are drawn scenes at important moments in the story that are then available later in the gallery.The audio quality is good. Throughout the story there is pleasing music in the background. The non-player character voice lines are voice acted. Each characters voice actor seems fitting to their personality. The butler's voice is pleasantly charming. The voice over, music, and sound affects volume can each be adjusted individually.The game features a skip text mode which is very handy in going back and completing other routes. There are community guides available which detail how to achieve all endings.Overall, I recommend this game as the quality is well worth the low price."

I can't tell which time period this is set in and for some reason the strict, well-to-do mother says ""anyways"". As in, you can read the word in the text and hear the voice actor say it.The characters are probably meant to come across as fairly snooty and/or reserved. Unfortunately, this causes them to feel dull and one-dimensional. I did enjoy Sophie the maid, despite her becoming a bit grating at times.Voice acting is solid enough but there are several moments when the clips were cut a little too short, creating a jarring sensation. The music is relatively pleasant, although it does become repetitive. There are at least 'preferences' so that you can just turn it right down.I think what I enjoyed most was the strange art-style. You could say the expressionless shadows are a brilliant metaphor for the game itself. Still, I enjoy it and I feel it's somewhat wasted on a game that appears not to have nearly as much effort put into it as it could have.Please note my gameplay time might be a little off as I left the game running in the background a few times.[Conclusion] 3.5/10In my opinion,Michaela Lawscan do much better than this. I'll be keeping my eye out in future for further titles from her."

,Not Recommended,457530,30406467,Posted: 9 March,all,Nuuskiss,"Sligthly dissapointing even for its cheap price. My Lady is extremely short visual novel which tells about young lady in distress and how she is secretly in love with her butler. Meanwhile her mother has totally other plans for her daughter and invites a young suitor to heat things up.While the game is decently voice acted, it is very hard to identify with characters because they are both metaphorically and literally faceless. The thin content of the story simply doesn't provide plot twists or anything mindblowing that would make it a memorable experince - it just goes on rails and doesn't surprise. And while there is some branches in storyline the endings are more or less the same excluding the epilogue's popping subtitles in the end.So as a final verdict I'd say that do not bother unless you are a big fan of the dev who really has done some better titles in steam than this."

,Recommended,457530,28459404,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,niX,"For a dollar, I was impressed. You do get what you pay for, however, as this story is not very long. ""My Lady"" is about a young rich woman in love with her butler. She is of the age to find a suitor, but only wants the adoration of the one man she simply cannot have. It's a very simple and short story. It took me about 15 minutes to read through my first time. All five endings will most likely take you an hour, maybe an hour and a half tops.The artwork is a bit lacking, as the characters lack any fine details. They essentially look like mannequins wearing clothes, and don't have any facial features. This didn't bother me much, and it actually gives the game a sort of charm to it in it's own odd way.I was immediately impressed by the fact that all characters (with the exception of the main character) are all fully voiced. This is something that you don't see even in expensive VN's at times. I appreciated the effort put in. They certainly didn't have to go the extra mile for such a small game, but they did.The game has choices to influence the endings. Although there are technically 5 endings, it mostly boils down to if you get to be with the butler or not. Some choices don't matter, but even if they don't, it's not like the story drags out with the few extra choices that are thrown in. All endings are easily achieveable, meaning that this game isn't a big time commitement, even if you wanted to read every piece of dialogue and go through every ending.Overall, a nice little story that can be read quickly if you've got some time to spare. There was very little that I disliked about this."

You play as a wealthy young lady who is in love with your butler.Steam: $0.99The art is very simplistic. But it has its own appeal and style. There are only a few different backgrounds. There is a small selection of CG’s as well.The gameplay is very simple. Read and then make a choice. There are only a few choices in the entire game. But that’s mostly because the game is sooooo very short. I unlocked all the endings in under an hour.But the question is: Was it worth it?I liked it. I thought it was clever that a couple choices really could decide you fate. While it is very short it is also very cheap. The artwork was charming and the story got it’s point across quickly.

Now, to be fair, I wasn't expecting much; 99 cents, independent game, whatever. I figured it'd be worth a shot.Hoo boy. So we'll start with the pros. It's cute! The art is nice for ambiguity on all the characters apppearances, giving an air of inserting ones own ideas as to how everyone looks. And I like the naming system, as silly as that is. I used my partner;s middle name, as well as mine for the title characters. The voice acting was well done. Michela Laws is on my subscribed list on YouTube, so she was the main reason I bought the game.Unfortunately, the cons far out-rank the pros. I'm disappointed with the dialogue. Yes, the game is short, but there are better uses of speech and exposition that could have been alloted for this story. Length is not an issue for me; substance is. I've read better in penny-romance novels from the dollar store. The whole chess element is odd, and not gone into enough. It was confusing to add, and since it was only for the storyline choices, it honestly made no sense with the in-game situations. The endings themselves were predictable, the characters lackluster and generally unappealing across the board. My biggest issue, though? That there are MULTIPLE dialogue/character choices that ultimately DO. NOTHING.  and automatically send you towards the worst ending. No real indicators of which choices will change your path or not. And while I get that the mechanic is more or less the point of the choices, I technically had this game beaten in 45 minutes; I spent an annoyingly long time into finding the 'correct' answers.All-in-all, this game was unfortuantely not worth the pennies I spent on it. I applaud the attempt, but would recommend refining the text and options for another venture into gaming novellas such as this. 1/5 stars."

However, if you're looking for depth and a choices game that blows your freaking mind and leaves you wondering what the hell you did wrong/right to get that ending I wouldn't recommend this, if you're looking for a quick piece of predicatble fluff then this is definitely your jam.

(Only for the sappy romantics) Such as myself. I highly recommend it, Honestly, it can be played a lot. There are different outcomes upon what decision you make. Too bad they did not make it longer!"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

It's a simple game, but if you've got a dollar and a little bit of time to kill it's a nice little romp. So long as you don't go in expecting a novel you should be pretty pleased."

As the game's description suggests, there are branching paths and multiple endings. The game itself is rather short, you should be able to get all endings within an hour. Despite it's length the game is rather good. The writing is crisp and to the point. The music is pleasant to listen to and fits the story. The character and background art, while limited, is more than suitable for this game. Given that the game is priced for a dollar, there is no reason not to pick it up if you are a fan of visual novels or narrative-driven games."
,Recommended,457530,22868920,"Posted: 8 May, 2016",all,Akanue,"A very interesting game with a good story and romance that got me invested. The voice acting and music were extremely good for an indie visual novel. The choice of faceless mannequins was... different and I would have preferred at least a CG with their actual faces, but you could also see the choice as providing a blank slate to input yourself into the story, so don't let it put you off. I was very glad I bought and played."
76561197994619541,Recommended,457530,22540154,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Crazy Cat Lady,"Cute, short visual novel. Emphasis on short - you can easily earn all the endings & achievements in under an hour. The story is simple and straightforward – you’re in love with your butler, but he’s too polite to romance a lady of your standing. The romance is not deep by any means, but if you get the right ending(s) you’ll be filled with warm fuzzies.I thought the art style – grey, faceless people - was sort of off putting at first, but by the time I finished my first play through I decided I really liked it. It gives the game a bit of a surreal, dream-like quality.BGM is nice. I wasn’t a fan of the voice overs and muted them fairly early on.If you’re a big fan of otomes and you’re looking for something short it’s worth the $1 price tag."

I was a bit hesitant at first because the art is different than the other games that I've played before but this game is defnitly worth trying. I liked that it was fully voiced and I really liked the characters. I wish it was a bit longer though because I enjoyed it.

The butler's voice actor did have a harder task, when comparisons to Jeeves, Sebastian, the Downton mob, and Anthony Hopkins in Remains of the Day are inevitable, but he does alright. The choices are well thought up, with a good mix of unexpected and decoy choices that at least took me by surprise. And the game is short enough to find the best ending by good old fashioned trial and error."

I absolutely loved it to pieces.The moment I was able to name my butler, I named him after my boyfriend and made him my end goal, haha.For how short it was, I found myself very involved with the characters, despite not having faces (but imagination takes care of that). The voices were very good. Sophie was kind of annoying at first, but my god does she grow on you. The butler's voice was very swoon-worthy *_*This game totally gave me feels and turned me into that squealing romantic school girl that I keep hidden deep down in a dark pit. Very rarely does that rabid girl ever get to come out, but when she does I have the best time!Game gets a 10/10 in my book! Worth every penny~"
