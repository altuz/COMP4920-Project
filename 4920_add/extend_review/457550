One time, I fell asleep watching a movie and woke up a bit confused because I was still in my beautiful fake apartment.I demo the Vive to a lot of people, and everyone has a different app/game that really gets them as ""The Thing"" that makes VR magic to them.  I'd say this app 'gets' probably 1 out of 5 people as the jaw-dropping thing that they love.  (And that's strong, because the rest of the 4/5 is split across probably 10 other cool things).When VR glasses get smaller and wireless, I'm probably going to live in this apartment about as much as I do my own.  Don't judge me."

I've been using it to Watch Anime, Netflix and unnamed movies from a unnamed movie site through my Vive. Anime looks particularly good. Things look layered. Characters look like they are standing in the enviroment(I have a Mainstream anime site subscription, so I'm watching it at the best quality).Over 9000/10"

,Recommended,457550,30193671,Posted: 26 February,all,AshPod,"This was a blast! I watched some movies with some people that I don't know, they were also very friendly. We had a chat, and it was generally really cool. The downside is that, I met someone we had great fun, he had to go, and he was never seen again :(  But overall I 100% recommend this game. The best part? It's free!"

Truly outstanding.It's a tool (bring your Desktop to VR)It's a virtual Cinema (yes, SBS 3D-Movies work).It's a way to play all your non-VR gsmes in VR, albeit not natively, but on a virtual Screen.It's a social experience, where you can experience the beforementioned features together with other people, who are represented with their virtual avatars (Heads/Hands).So, I just experienced one of those goosebumps inducing moments: started a public room. Switched to the cinema-preset. Started VLC-player, put it on the virtual silverscreen, started ""The Matrix"". Room was joined by others, watched the beginning of the movie together, sitting ""next"" to each other...10/10, would jack in to the matrix again."

Here is a list of cool features in the game.0 Bug, 0 Performances issuesMultiplayer modeAwesome communityFrequent updatesUI well polishedUx as wellYou won't feel like you are running on BetaIn Bigscreens, the most cool stuff to do is to play alone to watch movies or documentary on your own theater sized screen and actually in your own theater. Meeting people who love virtual reality and who will try to speak with you if you have a minimum english speaking level, and sharing awesome contents eachothers.Just stop reading reviews and buy it, you won't regret.If developers are reading this, it'd be awesome to make us able to moove in environements and not just sitting.And thanks a lot for your work."

,Recommended,457550,30000711,Posted: 17 February,all,JoycieC,"Bigscreen does a stunning job of providing you with a friendly environment that you can share with both friends and strangers.I entered a room to watch John Wick, ran into an issue where my headset went black (twice) but I will not fault something classed as beta, what it does it does very well.Being able to project your entire monitor onto a large wall so that each user can watch and listen at the same time is so basic yet so brilliant, it's the kind of VR experience we have all wanted and it's shaping up to be more than just a fun little tool to mess around in.When VR becomes more maintsream I can see software like this becoming the norm and communication being redefined completely.If you haven't tried it already, please do. It really does a great job of displaying your desktop nicely."
,Recommended,457550,29689822,Posted: 4 February,all,Kinky Koala,"This is one of the coolest experiences I have ever had in my life. The best wasy to describe it is that it is like having a LAN party with your friends, even though they are at their house.Downloaded this only to watch movies on my rift, but when I discovered the multiplayer rooms, my mind was blown. You literally are teleported to a room with other people and you can play games together, watch movies together, or just hang out. It is a free program, give it a shot!"

76561197961485482,Recommended,457550,30048839,Posted: 19 February,all,Radical Shnag,"Bigscreen is a VR desktop and chatroom but the stand out feature is multiplayer screen sharing in VR. Singleplayer it is a solid virtual desktop with a good UI. In multiplayer each user can stream their desktop in the room as if each person had their own monitor. It is a very cool sensation to sit ""side by side"" with friends in the VR room and play a game online together, though the framerates will vary.I used the Vive with a GTX 970 I was able to get ~20-30 FPS with Rocket League, and when watching the game on my friends' screens I got ~2 FPS. On a more gracefully streaming game, Tricky Towers, my friends mentioned they got around 10-15 FPS when watching my screen. There are a few steam settings that need to be changed to run games without closing Bigscreen, and some games will need to be in Borderless Window.The tech is very impressive but I would have liked a bit more focus on privacy. Once a room is joined, the default setting is to immediately start streaming your desktop. Also, the Vive microphone was active by default. There didn't appear to be an easy way to mute that didn't involving aiming a laser pointer at a virtual screen. Regardless of these issues, it is an excellent VR desktop and chatroom with a good UI. The environments look good and have a couple of different orientations, such as a couch and TV or a bed with the screen projected on the ceiling. Absolutely worth giving it a try."

Works really well too.Very impressed with this.  Strange to say perhaps, but its just a plain nice place to be.  Stick on some nice music and just sit on the north balcony and relax. Shame the enviroment backgrounds weren't animated but hey, you cant have everything.  The cinemas are great too, to make it perfect I need to find some sort of EQ/DSP effects to give the sound a suitable reverb level for the room though.  Great stuff, keep up the good work!"
,Recommended,457550,29998898,Posted: 17 February,all,Prunes,"Most folks in Bigscreen are fairly cerebral and friendly.   Met some Brits and a guy from Washington and we had a four man, guitar, jam session around a campfire.  It is limited to four folks per room which is nice in that you have more control over your company.   You can watch movies and listen to music and trouble shoot VR tech issues.   Pretty great stuff!"
,Recommended,457550,29914923,Posted: 13 February,all,rooms,"I would have paid up to $10 for this and still have had it been worth it to me. Best way to use your flatscreen programs in VR, I've spent hours watching Black Mirror in the theater (that was a trip, especially when I got to the VR episodes) and the performance environments are much better for gaming than the default Steam theater."

,Recommended,457550,30067820,Posted: 20 February,all,Hendew,"I just tried out the multiple monitor support. This is the feature I've been wanting, and its great. This is my favorite vr desktop app. It is fairly easy to position the monitors so you don't notice the screen door effect so it doesn't hurt your eyes as much. I really hope that the next generation of headsets have high enough resolution so you can use them all day.I would like to be able to rotate the monitors, Having to add lots of space between the monitors just to account for the spherical nature of how they attach to your center point is kind of annoying.In the future it would be nice to have virtual monitors. For example I may only have one physicall monitor and a headset connected to my computer. But inside Bigscreen I could create 2+ virtual monitors(Install drivers so the os thinks it has two additional monitors. Look into the Air Display ios app). I use 4 monitors at work currently, and I dream of the day where I can have as many monitors as I want using a vr headset."

,Recommended,457550,29634881,Posted: 1 February,all,KingKj52,"A great social experience for friends in VR, and even with strangers. You've heard all that before.I used it for escapism, and it worked wonders. Binging a show on Netflix, except instead of my measly dorm room, I'm now in an extravagant loft, laying on a couch. Instead of laying on a bed, head turned to the side, to watch off a monitor a few feet away, I was laying on my back, head nestled into my pillows, as I kicked back and had a massive screen right where I look.The devs are great and will help you with anything you may need, and lots of features and improvements are always in the works. For the low low price of free, why not give it a go?"
