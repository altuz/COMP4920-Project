76561198140442560,Recommended,457570,26282479,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,IAmThePonch,"After chewing it over, I think I can actually recommend this one despite its rough edges.Camp Sunshine places you in the shoes of Jez, a surly teenager who is sent to summer camp by his parents for initially unknown reasons. When he gets to the titular Camp Sunshine, he says farewell to his mother and meets his bunk mate, who says Buddy an uncomfortable amount of times. Then Jez goes to sleep and wakes up to find almost everyone in the camp murdered in bloody fashion. It's not long before he finds the freak in a mascot costume repsonsible for the murders, and he soon learns that in order to stop this supernatural being, which can teleport at random, he will have to find several diary pages and corresponding items and destroy them.The game, as you can tell, is a mixture of Slender: the Eight Pages, and top down pixel horrors such as Mad Father. You have to scour the open environment of Camp Sunshine in order to find all the items you need. Each note unviels the back story of what the hell is going on at the camp. It's a fun premise, but the game does have a lot of rough edges.For one, the dialogue feels really poorly written and rushed. Not only are commas misused all the time (either to combine two independent clauses, or they aren't used in spots where they should be) but the dalogue itself feels incredibly basic and on the nose. But that's okay, right? Plenty of horror games have great stories without great dialogue. Just look at Silent Hill 2. Sadly, the story proper is disappointing and predictable after a certain point, but there are also elements near the end that don't make a whole lot of sense (some more explanation would have helped greatly in this regard). There aren't really any interesting characters to latch on to, either, except maybe one of the ones from the flash backs that come with picking up diary pages. The reason for the main conflict is also never really explained in a satisfactory way, either (I'm being vague to prevent spoilers, just take my word on it). Characters also don't react to the situation at all half the time. You'll meet people in need throughout the game, and many won't even acknowledge that everyone's been slaughtered, and Jez will make no mention of this fact, either. It's jarring and bizarre.There are plenty of problems with the gameplay, too. For one, the mascot can appear anywhere. This means whenever you're outside or in a building, regardless of whether or not you have a place you could feasibly run to. IE, you'll be going down a one way hallway and hear the mascot spawn, and there's literally no way for you to get out of the situation without taking damage. The spawn algorithm could have used some work in this regard, because pretty much the only time you'll ever get hit is when the game spawns the monster at an inconvenient time rather than through any fault of your own. The second is that Jez movies really slowly, making walking across the camp a chore. I don't need it to be a super fast game, but after a certain point, the back tracking felt like a chore rather than enjoyable explanation. Lastly, I would have liked more hints as to where the items you need to find are. Some are located in logical places (like a emdical bracelet being in the nurse's office) but others you really have to stumble upon through blind luck, which can be annoying.One side note, you save by sleeping in beds. Which makes no sense. Why would you sleep when there's a killer that can teleport at will? And why would you sleep in a bed covered in blood, something you can do regularly as long as it's furnished? There's also a myriad of glitches, from audio skips that are fairly common, to hard crashes that require a restart of the game (I had to play the ending sequence twice because the final few scenes wouldn't trigger and instead the game froze).The game's not all bad. I really liked the open ended structure and exploration driven gameplay. The game also looks pretty nice for pixel art, with plenty of stomach churning gore and solid sound effects that sell the gruesome atmoshere (unfortunately, Jez's whiny and casual way of dealing with things often cuts the atmospheric effect off short; seriously, he goes to search a dead body and acts annoyed that he has to do it, rather than disgusted or horrified). I wouldn't mind seeing this structure and atmosphere improved upon in a sequel or follow up. One last thing, the soundtrack is kickin and feels like a classic 80's slasher movie.There's a lot to like about this game and its concept, just be aware that there are a LOT of rough parts that could be smoothed out. I'm curious about what the developers can cook up for a sequel (or even potential DLC) and see how they improve on their solid foundation."

,Recommended,457570,31281176,Posted: 21 April,all,Hawk Zombie,"I went into this game expecting something a bit different. From what I heard, it was an RPGMaker version of Slenderman-type games: go and find all the pages before the big bad can kill you. While it does follow the same sort of formula, there are several ways that it makes it a bit more interesting.Each diary page you find opens up more about backstory of why everything is happening. Also, each page has a certain item associated with it that you need to find as well. Several pages are only rewarded after completing quests and there is a good deal of NPC interaction. So while it does use the hunt and find mechanic and jump scares, I think it does so very well.+Good price for what you get.+Excellent cutscene graphics and original art that matches the base tileset (It uses the POP!: Horror City one)+The extra voices added more to the ambiance, and were very well done.+The graphics and custom systems they incorporated into the engine were VERY well done.+Good and interesting storyline that kept me interested until the end.+Does NOT suffer from dozens of typos or ‘Engrish’.=One of the last bridge puzzles had no restart button, and it took me a frustratingly long while to figure it out.=The bear can appear right next to you sometimes, giving you little chance to react. You can, thankfully, run faster than him.=The ending was a little hokey, but it fit the game.-The white flower quest: the flowers aren’t marked on the map, so searching for them can be difficult without a guide/map indicating their locations.-A bit short, but the good story helps to make up for this. (My played time is due to idling for cards).TLDR: A great little seek and find horror game with an interesting story and unique ‘boss fight’ at the end. I got it when it came out and don’t regret it one bit."

The story is well put together and full of great horror tropes. The story is where this game shines. It is well paced and slowly reveals itself through a good narrative. It keeps the player interested and engaged.The music and sound effects are top notch. The sunshine bear's voice is great.The pixel graphics are outstanding.You should be able to complete this game in about 2.5 hours at most. Recommended if you like fun horror and exploration."

,Recommended,457570,26399445,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,JayTMax,"Camp Sunshine is an ode to both 80's horror and to the 16-bit era of gaming, and a rather nostalgic and fun-to-play ode it is! Perhaps the most impressive feat of the game is just how well it captures the spirit of both.First off, I felt like I was playing a game straight from the mid-90's, although one benefiting from some modern polish and shine; some of the things that I've seen other reviewers complain about, such as weird dialogue and nonsensical requests from side characters, I had actually taken as a deliberate nod to the gameplay of old-style SNES games. While the SNES, in the USA, did not come out with a game of this type, if they had I have a strong feeling the game play and character interactions would have been very similar. I was under the impression that this is what the developers were going for, so I believe they nailed it.Secondly, I felt like I had stepped back into the 80's as well at several points, in some sort of weird-but-awesome point in time where the video game mechanics and conventions of the 90's met the pop culture and style of the 80's.A word of warning: Going into this game, realize that the mood of the 80's horror is more reminiscent of some of the later films of the decade which were more self-aware and deliberately campy good fun, as opposed to some of the earlier titles that took themselves seriously, even if some of those earlier titles ended up being campy by accident. So the game makes room for on-purpose silliness like, say, one of the later Friday the 13th titles, rather than going for a serious and strictly foreboding atmosphere like Halloween II (1982) or the original Friday the 13th (1980). With the exception, that is, of the killer's origin story, which is remarkably grim and takes itself rather more seriously. I actually found the contrast interesting, though, with the origin story providing a darker and solemn tale, while the present-day story was more willing to loosen up and get silly sometimes.The killer in this tale, dressed up as the Camp Mascot ""Sunshine Bear"" will remind you a dash more of a stalker like Freddy Krueger or the killer from Wes Craven's ""Shocker,"" than of Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers: He talks and drops some one liners as he stalks you. I found it to be well-done, and in line with the overall mood of the game.Does the game have its moments where it's rough around the edges? Sure. However, not only are the developers working on patches even as I type this review, I want to point out that even many professional games from the 16-bit-era the developers are mimicking have similar rough edges, and yet never failed to provide a generation of gamers with delight and entertainment. So somehow this game just seems very authentic, like it was a genuine and real production from those days rather than an Indie Game by a two-man team. The game is also relatively short, clocking in at about 3 to 4 hours if you're used to this sort of game (though I've heard from the developers that some players take around 8 hours) but that just helps its replayability in my opinion. Still, if you want a lot of game time for your buck, you've been notified.Overall, I believe that the guys at FossilGames have done the horror and gaming communities a great service here. I personally enjoyed it enough to play it obsessively more than once, and even make a guide for it, for whatever that says about how much I liked it. If you enjoy the themes and styles it seeks to mimic, as described in this review, then I think you won't regret your purchase, especially not at this very good and affordable price: In the 90's, I could easily see a comparable game, length and all, being put on store shelves for at least three times as much."
76561198037077800,Recommended,457570,31813406,Posted: 17 May,all,dystopicfilms,"For those who love a good bit of post-modern Horror revisionism, 'Camp Sunshine' is the tongue-in-cheek 80s slasher gem that you never knew you needed but absolutely can not live without.The story is your standard 80s Horror affair. You play a boy named Jez, who as luck would have it looks suspiciously like the tubby kid from 'Stranger Things'. He's been sent by is mother to a Crystal Lake style summer camp and before too long, campers start winding up cut to ribbons. It is then up to Jez to piece together the story as best he can to find out exactly why this strange phenomena is occuring and unmask the killer before Jez joins the ranks of his victims.Created using an RPG emulator similar to the ones used to make 'Pokemon' and the early 'Zelda', the game is mainly exploration based with the odd pick up thrown in. The references to some of the late 20th Century's most beloved Horror movies come thick and fast, proving that this is very much a genre fans' game, and it's interesting to be able to digress briefly from your quests to search for some of the more obscurely placed Easter Eggs littered throughout the environment. All the while, desperately trying to avoid the grinning vision of 'Sunshine Bear', a sociopathic theme park mascot who wants your guts for garters.If you're someone who misses the good old days of blood and gore, visceral Horror gaming, this may help to provide some degree of sustanance. Just don't go expecting to hack and slash your way through hordes of undead. Like so many Indy titles these days, you are not a fighter. You are helpless kid with no means of defense beyond your own two feet. This will no doubt annoy some players, as will the 'Zelda'-esque way that the villain can literally appear from out of nowhere. However, when you're dealing with retro-movie logic, anything can happen.As a Horror fan through and through, I personally adore 'Camp Sunshine'. It's probably not to everyone's taste admitedly but then you can't please everyone all the time."
,Recommended,457570,26259913,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,fantomchoder,"Only had a short bit of time to give this a try tonight so i'll just review based on what I've seen and update as needed after I get more time to play. Overall I liked what I played so far. The game quickly loaded up without any issues at all so I was able to play immediately without any bs (sadly not always the case it seems these days). The artwork looks solid and definitely gives off a creepy vibe while playing. I'm pretty sure i'll have some fun with it once I get more time.Only criticisms that I came across (all minor) are:- Not able to rebind controller/keyboard mappings (their defaults are perfect though, and re-mapping with steam controller would have been easy if needed)- Controller uses the D-pad to move instead of the controller joystick which isn't mapped to anything. For this one I switched over to the steam controller to map the D-pad controls to the joystick. I can't use a D-pad on an Xbone controller anymore whereas on keyboard it feels more natural so I had to switch since I was in the mood to use a controller.- Character movement is always mutually exclusive to the x or y axis, which is reflected in their strict use of the D-pad. So even with my steam controller, I still couldn't move diagonally at all which isn't ideal when walking down windy trails trying to run from a murderer. This was still a minor criticism but it's the one that bugged me the most. Of course, it's possible that this may have been part of the classic style which they were trying to achieve.- Character dialog seemed a little unrealistic. It just didn't feel too believable to me in some conversations. Also, the main character's first words to a few people weren't ""$**#&$*# I JUST FOUND A BODY!!""."

For the most part it is a generic horror movie esk game where you take the role as Jez who had just been sent to summer camp only to soon for the entire camp to be attacked by a mysterious killer in a bear costume.  The story starts to progress by finding diary notes all around the camp that explains the background of the camp.  Although these notes can be kind of annoying to get because most of them are from ""fetch quests"" it kept me playing because each diary page contained more cutscenes about the past owner and a mysterious curse with his child, Isaac (kinda reminds me of Lakeview Cabin Collection).  Another thing I would have to compliment it on is it's soundtrack and how it could make for some of the creepiest momments throughout the game.  Aside from the pros, the game did have a couple of problems with crashing when you would activate a secret cutscene, how hard it was to find some items, and the walking was a little rough at times but it did create funny momments walking into the wall after being hit by the killer.  Overall, in my opinion, this was worth the $7.99."

The camp is a creepy bloodbath, the bear is ESPECIALLY creepy and to me the story really goes back to the older genre of horror. It's got me super interested in how this is all gonna end. Not many real scares/jumpscares aside from the bear so far. Wish there were more but still a good pick up in my book."
,Recommended,457570,26392459,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,targrus,"Okay, I saved writing this until I finished the game. So the plot is cheesy, and the dialogue can be a little cringe worthy, and.. I really loved it! 16-bit style visuals are near and dear to my heart, and so is the horror genre. Toss in some more general geeky and 80's references for seasoning and it shows that these developers really get the kind of stuff I'm into. This isn't a long game. I think I finished in ~2 hours. But it was well worth the price of admission and I had a great time playing through it. The visuals and music I really appreciated, and the cheesy horror plot served it's purpose. Bear mascots are now even creepier, yet again. (A note to aspiring devs. Focus on another mascot in the future!)One thing I will say is that the game is NOT terribly forgiving. I mostly wanted to just enjoy the experience, and wound up playing at the loweest difficulty after dying a lot on normal. The two hit kill mechanic fits, but in practice it means ""get hit, eat, repeat"" for a good chunk of the game. That being said, it didn't detract from the experience for me at all."

The only thing i think that holds me back from giving this a complete 10/10 is the fact that the dialogue seems a little rushed/forced.

NO I dont want a easy pie game but the suggestions I think would help improve the game. So please no haters!!!  I  played  Friday the 13th on Nintendo and trust me it was very hard!!! But the map was easy to memorize and navigating it helped!! Yes I know this is not Friday 13th but I think some of the mechaincs in theFriday 13th game helped to make it a little bit easier to get around. That's all !!!!! Just please take in my thoughts and again NO HATERS!!! Just giving my thoughts how this game could be improved on."

The main game play revolves around finding items around the camp all the while avoiding a crazed maniac that's killed everyone. As long as you check every cabin, you're gonna find everything.  There are a small handful of actual puzzles to solve. There is no combat in the game at all. There is not a lot of voice acting in the game, but is there is very well done. The bear costume maniac sounds a lot like Freddy and a female counselor in distress sounded especially chilling. There are a lot of references to different horror franchises including Friday the 13th (of course), Halloween 3, Demonic Toys, Child's Play, and a few others. The whole game takes around 3 hours to finish. One annoying thing was that there was no analog stick support for the controller and using the directional pad was unwelcome."

Everyone has jumped on the whole 8-bit revival train and I've been waiting for what seems like forever for a decent 16-bit revival indie game and this definitely scratched that itch. That combined with horror-esque themed games being my favorite genre, this is definitely checking all the right boxes! Controls well, I never feel like I don't know what to do or where to go next so far, great asthetic... Definitely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of 80s slashers!"

Although this one didn't have many jump scares in it, and the enemy wasn't hard to avoid at all. I really enjoyed the story and will definatley be looking into playing more games of this style.You can check out my playthrough of this title with the video below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q40TEmsEUc&list=PLFhxnvQFRXfqJDW6hljTwyoOgou6ohB9wThanks guys"
,Recommended,457570,29829051,Posted: 10 February,all,The Lord of the Shadows,"Camp Sunshine is a quite short game where you have to find items while hidding and running away from a killerbear. You might find it quite similar to games like Slenderman because you have to find pages while the enemy appears randomly anywhere.Pros- Spooky atmosphere with few lights around that increases the feeling of anything could pop out from the darkness.- Good story with a few nice cutscene animations.- It doesn't rely on jumpscares (ok, there is 1 or 2 *rolls eyes* ).- It takes 2 hits to kill you so it's not just you are caught and it's game over.- You can be killed while checking the map so you don't stay like that for too long. However, using items in your inventory will pause the game allowing you to exploit being hit and eating food for healing.- The map will show the location of the people that gave you quests and where you are supossed to go to complete them. It's quite handy because the map is big.- There are plenty of easter eggs and references around.Cons- Sometimes you can walk around the whole camp and never find the bear and other times find it way too often.- There are scripted places where the bear will appear that just surprise you the first time it happens.- On the one hand the batteries run out way too fast, but on the other hand there are so many batteries around allowing you to keep your flashlight always on if you do a fast enough run (might not be like that on the hardest difficulty)- When you are hit the bear disappears, that's good so you aren't trapped in a narrow corridor against a wall, but at the same time that allows you to eat something quickly to recover health while the game is paused letting you be hit as many times as food you have.- You are so likely to get lost and forget which buildings have you entered and since there are so many items you have to find you might end up wandering looking for the last items you need.- The fact that the bear won't chase you outside or inside of a building or see you hide into a bush right in its face is not realistic at all. Needing to be at certain distance for it to lose track of you would be better.- Sometimes the bear will run too fast, as fast as your own running speed while you have limited stamina.Overall, a good game for horror rpg maker games fans even if short."

But so far it's pretty good. It really deliveres the feel where you don't even want to go out of your cabin because the thought of getting chased and killed by a bear mascot with a butcher knife and a tase for blood give you MAJOR anxiety. The fact that the map is super big yet so small, gives you chills because1. you can't NOT be spotted2. you can't hide in the bushes or somethingand 3. YOU COULD D I E !This game is good so please buy this RPGMaker masterpiece."

There's no fighting enemies like other RPGs, but instead you just have to make your way through the game tracking down Diary Pages.  This in itself is not so bad, but I found myself becoming lost occasionally with no aim as to what or where to go and what to do next... it can get really annoying, especially for those of us who don't like the pacing of the game to falter just because we can't find ONE thing.The game also crashes a bunch, most of the time when entering a building.  This is especially frustrating when you haven't saved in awhile.The game as a whole is enjoyable.  There's some VERY AWESOME 80s shout-outs to horror.  I think the Easter Eggs by themselves were probably my favorite part about the game.  I just wish Fossil Games would have ironed out the bugs first."

This is funny right?! Laugh, please!!!""---Killer is a hilarious FNAF clone at best and utterly annoying at worst (which he is most of the time). He turns up way too often (approximately 2 times a minute) and when he does he's just sort of there. No musical cue while you're being stalked makes it pretty drab - some of the lines he says when he appears are somewhat funny, though this can be seen as a good or a bad thing)--Has the typical signs of lazy RPG Maker devs such as being able to walk through walls and out of bounds of the level area, player sprite turning invisible, events interrupting one another etc etcI really wanted to like this game since RPG Maker games and slasher movies are two my passions, but I just can't recommend it the way it is... Rework the killer mechanics, streamline the collect-a-thon, fix the worst bugs and I'd probably change my mind."

I was hoping for the entire length of the game that at least something original, unexpected will come up – but I wasn't rewarded in the end. There was next to no flavor text, just a little excuse of a plot, and a lame ending.The ""16-bit feeling"" is probably the only winning point, but there are too many games exploiting this aesthetic now. Being tedious and repetitive isn't something that you can call evoking the spirit of the older games.Would not recommend ever."

There's a glow around you so you really don't need it. Go in and out of buildings alot and save early and often. Great game. HIGHLY Recomended.
