Overall, it looks quaint, but for whatever reason, I'm very fond of this experience. It's a bit easier on the eyes than Demonic Guest, and the choreography is considerably better. In Demonic Guest, you reside in the center of the bed, in this experiance, I think you're supposed to be sitting on the edge. You may have to adjust your physical location a bit.You come home from work and take a rest, before your wife does the same, but she has become possessed somehow. I wonder what happened to her. What's the backstory on the lady visitor?http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=896713125"

Steam VR only just implemented support for runtime 1.3. It does work, but the scale is totally off. Basically the player character is about three meters large. I assume this is caused by some problem between the very new runtime 1.3 and the newest beta of Steam VR and not a problem of this game. Just keep in mind that, should you choose to play this on a Rift DK2 or CV1, you'll likely have the same problem until Steam VR gets patched.On to the game: It's really short (about 10 minutes), but it totally managed to achieves what it sets out to. It's a very simple experience without any controls except for the players ability to look around using his VR headset, but given the result the asking price seems reasonable and so I recommend this game to those who have a VR headset and are looking for a short horror experience."

A few of them even refused to continue playing half-way through the game, so they failed their test.

I'll just say that this isn't scary, that's the only reason I wouldn't recommend it as it is fairly boring and could only be scary if you never experienced horror before.

There were about 3 events that occurred and each felt equally underwhelming and gave FAR too much dead time in between. The developer clearly ignored many issues like the volume requiring to be maxed out on your computer in order to hear anything and cut many other corners. I really am not keen on the lack of care that was given and don't wish to support the developer for something that doesn't feel worth it. I am happy to fund devs for the Vive as I really believe in its future, but I think by supporting indie devs who hold little care for their products will only bring on more and lead to the Vive being something bogged down with too much shovel ware to be regarded as something truly enthralling by outside eyes. If I knew he was really trying to put out something he cared for I would happily fund him expecting him to work harder and later on create better experiences, but it's clear he does not care all too much."

I shouted and pressed buttons on my Vive controller frantically to make it stop at one point, followed by laughing at myself for a minute straight. Even though part of my brain knew that I could just close my eyes to make it go away, I had no control over the reaction. My wife only made it about 2 minutes into the experience before screaming out loud and telling me to shut it down.Great work!"

I play through the lab, and other standing VR games.. tired.. I sit down in a chair I had in the room to take a break. I scroll through the VR games (mind you, this is early on, very few games for Vive existed) and I see this item for $1.I figure, what do I have to lose. I buy it, install it.. and launch it. Almost immediately, I realize I just made a mistake. Not by buying it, but by being seated when I launched it. The experience starts with me lying in bed. And I really feel like I am there. Basically paralyzed. The scares come quickly as the sound design is VERY spooky and very well done. The graphics, perfectly scary. There is someone or something at the door.. but I am stuck in this bed. I hear it enter. I even see something come up the steps. What is it? Who is it? What happens then? I still can't tell ya.. I get scared and exit out every time I played it so far.Had you scared me once.. it would be worth $1.. but still not being able to tell you how it ends? Priceless. Great work and a real treat."

You cannot do anything except look around. With that said the 5 minutes is a pretty well done 5 minutes. This could becoeme a very good game or movie. As is, it's just something that 'could be.' Don't buy this expecting a game or interactive experience. We tried this with a group of people and even those watching were scared. It was pretty creppy but it was too short that we wanted more. No actual 'scary' game that we paid for comes close tot his. We've tried 'The Cubicle' and 'chair in a room: greenwater' and none of those are scary. They're more of a puzzle game with some weirdness to it. Since this is only 0.99 cents it's totally worth it for the experience. Use it to scare your friends and family and give them a taste of what a real experience could be like."

There was always something new to see when you saw those lights flash.The mood was great, the events were spooky and I only recall maybe two very surprising elements, but just playing through the experiences had me on edge no matter where I looked.The game does not have immediate replay value; however, if you wait long enough for your memory to fade and come back to it again later, it is still fun and even more fun to foist this on a family member who has not played it or see you play it.For an inexpensive, yet well done VR experience, it has my recommendation."
