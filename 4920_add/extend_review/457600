,Not Recommended,457600,22763405,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,MyMy,"It's a simple game of territory control and resource management and there wouldn't be anything wrong with it, if it wasn't advertised as 4X and the price tag was 2-3 times lower.Good things: combines two genres, one of them is survival game and it's not enough of those in the market.Bad things: looks like an old browser game, not many abilities on the map, weapons progression is not interesting, combat is ok but repetitive and '4X' part is way too shallow.Deal breaker, but it's very personal: campaign doesn't make any sense, you only take a few items into the next mission, and it's quite hard and slow paced game, so it doesn't feel right to play everything all over again. Even research is not taken into the next mission. Let alone the soldiers and their abilities you cared about. I'd play a few days if the metagame was progressive. But as of now I can't imagine people to recommend it to.If you like survivor management games, I suggest playing Deadsville 3 - if you want something of a 'board game grade' simplicity. Or Dead State if you want a complex survivor base management with combination of something more meaningful (TBS)."
,Recommended,457600,22734433,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,Aurumlamina,"A nice surprise from the Indie market, Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is an entertaining strategic zombie survival game.  You won't be scavenging for supplies, directly rescuing survivors, or securing a clean source of water, though it has its own style of gameplay that I have found to be unique and fun in its own right.Each scenario that you play involves you taking control over a small colony with the goal of expanding and securing the city around you.  You'll be facing off against an ever increasing horde of zombies with new varieties arriving as time goes on.  To achieve this goal, and often other scenario-specific goals, you'll be researching technologies on three separate trees to assist you.  These tech trees will improve your resource collection (cash, crystals, production, and science) and will make your colony more effective at fighting off the encroaching ranks of the dead.Though much of the game is spent looking down at the city from a bird's eye view, there will be times when you take a more direct approach in defending your colony.  Your character, selected from one of three varying classes, will face off against the zombies in what feels like an improved Oregon Trail hunting mini-game.  A variety of weapon types and skills that can be upgraded when your character and their compatriots level also adds a level of strategy to this as weapons and abilities add a considerable amount of options to develop your own style of play.All in all, Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is an enjoyable game that I certainly don't regret spending my money on.  I would give a forewarning to those who might be on the fence, it does feel like a well designed mobile game.  However, when compared to said mobile games or the flash games that might do something very similar, Emerge does just enough to make those others obsolete on a purely gameplay basis.I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of zombie apocalypse games and is wanting to play one that isn't survival in its strictest term as gamers have come to know it.  It is an enjoyable strategy-lite that I can definitely see myself putting more hours into in the future."
,Recommended,457600,35225537,Posted: 26 September,all,mretsam,"An enjoyable game.  It features some throw backs to old zombie games with resource management.  It also comes with an isometric shooter, where you aim your cursor over the undead hordes that come down on you.  You are also able to have quite a skill tree to pick from when you are upgrading your weapons, and abilities.  One draw back to the combat system is that it's repetitive, but that is to be expected with most isometric shooters that are fixated in one position.  It's definitely not enough of a draw back to not play this game.If you like a nice throwback to older zombie games, and are a fan of base defense shooters, you will like this game. $7.99 isn't a bad price for the game, but I know you should be able to pick it up on sale also.  I'd at least make it to your wishlist until it hits a sale."

You gain resources that allow you to build turrets, buy weapons, and unlock new members who can help you defend your towns against the hordes of the undead. You can even fight battles both attacking and defensive in a barricade style like you would've seen in the Last Stand. It's all pretty badass. It's clearly been made by an amateur developer but there is a clearly a lot of effort with a very specific idea in mind and it combines to make one of the more unique zombie games I've played in a while. In summation, I highly recommend this game for the low price tag.Gameplay Footage:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8T9NcrKFdE"

There are plenty of classes, starting bonuses and weapons to choose.I could tell you things about this game for hours......But i prefer to give you a list of things as we are talking about something pretty big:_Build defenses (Automated turrets)_Manage random territories and capture these wisely (Each one gets its own statistics)_Explore (Random but expected ""positive"" or ""negative"" event)_Random events (The unexpected ones)_Big amount of loot including items, consumables and weapons (Those last with degrees of rarity of course!)_Build manufactories into your city (To improve your production, economy and science stats and even more things...)_Defend or attack territories by yourself, alone or with recruits (Nicely done that action part of the game)_Level-up system with perks to select (Each class gets its own skills)_There are a campaign, skirmish and a challenge mode_Spend your AP each turn carefully, in addition many options can be added on your AP bar._Research tree split on 3 branchs (Quite complex as you always want to pick up everything :D)_More of + 15 types of ennemies to fight (With 3 bosses)_And even more things you'll find out by yourself :)To conclude?First you'll find it hard, unbalanced and too agressive... And then you'll eventually learn (Unlike mostly of negative reviews who found it ""impossible"" within one hour or less) you'll find SO MANY possibilities, SO HUGE content to discover and unlock. Finally those ways you found firstly insanely tough, you'll laught about next :)So yeah, i enjoy it VERY much. It's not a game apparently to put on every hands as not everybody gets the patience required to understand it well. But if you enjoy challenges, good replayability, countless of possiblities, then you have to try out that hidden little gem which isEmerge: Cities of the apocalypse!Thank you for reading :)"
,Recommended,457600,32944170,Posted: 28 June,all,Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism,"With real-time zombie defense shooting reminiscent of Newgrounds-era flash games, to resource management with the aim of upgrading, buying, and selling,Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypseis an amalgamation of many different genres.Set in a vague futuristic post-apocalyptic backdrop, you're presented with a city map that you need to take back from the dead, block by block. Those who have played any of the Rebuild series of games will find many simularities: you need to balance out a multitude of resources, all the while expanding and upgrading the areas under your control. But it won't be easy: you'll need to defend from many different types of zombies and mutants, and ultimately you'll need to take the fight to them more often than not if you ever hope to expand beyond your walls (and win!). You won't be alone though: either through chance via random events, or straightforward hiring, you can fight against the undead with upwards of 3 characters. You can also set their combat AI. This is on top of a number of defenses you can implement.In your downtime, you can choose to 'Take a stroll, see what happens' and possibly come upon a random encounter. In typical RNG fashion, it can either be positive or negative, and some you can actually choose how you respond to, but I found that the amount of events seem limited in scope. This is one of my few criticisms of the game, but it can certainly be chalked up to my preferences alone.There is an element of replayability, with the chance to unlock different classes (some hidden), traits, map modifiers.Overall, Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is a hidden gem. The aesthetics of the game, ie. the setting, art, and music choices all work seamlessly and the gameplay, while basic, does provide enough replay value to make this game good value for your money. At the very least, it's a solid time-waster. It's also worth noting that the developer seems very passionate about his work and more than a year later is still releasing periodic updates.Definitely recommended. Support your indie developers!"

I was looking for a base building sim, and while the style of Emerge is a bit different than I envisioned when searching for a game of this kind, I was pleasantly surprised. This is an exceptional title and offers tons of replayability not to mention a ton of hours of gameplay for a single playthrough. A mix of strategy, live action combat, base building, as well as RPG elements such as leveling, equipping, and selecting skills for your party, I could go on and on.If you are looking for a zombie game this one is original, a ton of fun, and a great bargain.Can't wait for future updates or an Emerge 2, I'm already sold!"

,Recommended,457600,32750655,Posted: 24 June,all,Sheepify,"I mostly play offline, which Steam apparently does not track, so do consider that my play time is at least (and easily) five times higher than what shows.An amalgam of turn-based strategy and real-time ""tower-defense"" genres, Emerge is deceptively simple-looking for the replayability it offers. While the same elements that offer such high replayability also can cause somebody to burn out and get bored of it if played too much, on the other hand they do ensure that every time you return the game still holds its appeal.The strategy part has all the necessary ingredients. You will upgrade what sectors you hold, defend them from attacks, visit the weapon and equipment store, and interact with random events as a result of either patrols or game progress.The defensive mini-game is far less complex, but by no means utterly mindless. Depending on the choice of character classes, your different weapons will require different approach (though, frankly, a grenade-launcher is by far the best choice for the player-controlled character, and sniper rifles are superior to everything else for the AI). One excellent feature is the ability to modify the targetting behavior of your squad mates - and you certainly need to figure out how to employ them in the most efficient way before the big waves hit.There is plenty of variation in enemy types, frequently influenced by special conditions each map offers. Along with various traits you can pick for your squadmates and their weapon choice, this offers plenty of room for experimentation. Although, in all fairness, there are some clear winners.This is a somewhat recurring theme in Emerge - while there are lots of open possibilities, in the end only some of them will be truly worthwhile your attention. As another example, weapons offer two ""mod"" slots... but in the end, using some of them is more of a gimmick than actual benefit. Likewise for the technology progression - ultimately you will settle on a sequence of research progression that will only change when faced with specific map-enforced condition.It rather sounds worse than it plays, though. There is plenty of fun to be had elsewhere. The different enemy types that slowly appear have the capacity to completely change your previous approach to combat. Unlocking additional classes gives you more options, though both weapon loadouts and trait availability (where again, some are far superior than others). The ability to transfer items between maps is nice, but you will probably settle on the highest +infrastructure mod (the variable that allows faster expansion) as soon as you find it and stick with it regardless of what else you find. Though that's more of a self-inflicted issue than problem with the game itself :)Bottom line, Emerge is a very fun game that offers a LOT of replayability as long as you allow yourself to take a break whenever you begin to find it too repetitive. For me it is a pretty relaxing game, with enough challenge to it to work quite well as a way to relax after a stressful day at work.Even for the asking price, it's a steal, much less when offered at a discount."
,Not Recommended,457600,24299726,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,Wraith,"I've got really mixed feelings about this game. I've seen and played old flash games with similar concepts, They've done it better, by a lot.It's not a bad game per se, but it definitely need some improvement. If you don't rush certain tech you find find yourself hit pretty hard. There are some great utility skills, but not much point to use them considering you don't save any characters skills across games. It's not that hard to find yourself boxed into a back and forth where there isn't any point defending territory.To be honest with some tweaks it could be a beautiful thing and offer a lot of replayability. Crystals are too important and not that easy to get for how much they are needed. The scientist class takes the edge off, but leaves you feeling meh. The war chest post mission lets you hold 3 things, but you can only take one in? It's almost always going to be infrastructure. No point keeping a glowing weapon your characters can't use till the end of the map.If characters kept their levels AND your squad that you invested so much in either stuck around (or at least the slots did) I could definitely recommend it. Until then, not so much. Without those factors it just leaves you doing more of the same with some very minor spice thrown in.In short a major problem with this game is any actual progression, as opposed to temporary progression. It's bad enough that it's not really fun to play pretty quickly. If the author changes that, I'll swiftly change my review, because it only needs very minor things to be good.A little tip to the author, this is the kind of game that could be absolutely amazing if you opened it to modding. Lots of good opportunities."

It doesn't fit neatly in to any particular genre, but incorporates several, combining into a unique game with surprising strategic depth. The main game is turn based strategy including research, resource management, and light RPG elements. Battles become a real-time tactical shooting minigame.It's not an easy game. It's simple in that it the mechanics are easy to learn, but actually learning how to survive takes time and patience.There is no progressing ""campaign."" Instead you play a series of several different maps, each with diffrent objectives and rules. A few examples include having to simply ""secure"" the map (control a certain number of sectors) within a turn limit, or locate a specific survivor, or  you may be asked to beat  a map with a spefic player class. Beating these maps may unlock new world regions, new player classes, items, or abilities which you can use in future maps.The game is a labor of love by a single developer, and is not polished like a AAA title. The graphics are simple, but get the job done. The soundtrack is a decent futuristic techno grunge. The price is $8 when it's NOT on sale, so if you want a different take on a sci-fi zombie apocalypse, it's worth checking out!"

It is really important to know that these are only frequent if you use your action points to trigger them. You get 10AP a turn and you can trigger an event for 2. It is a nice little gamble you can choose to do if to avoid wasting points but you don’t have to and you can level your luck to swing the events in your favour. Don’t want to waste points on luck? Level it on one of your npc teammates and have them contribute to your gambling addiction. There are a few events that trigger on their own but these are not that frequent, maybe once or twice in a game, or not at all.For me this is in my catalogue of games that are great for breaking up the day, or playing a bit between chores so my play time is probably going to go up again the next time I’ve got some spring cleaning to do."

It has some different aspects to it, nothing overwhelming but none the less a solid gaming experience.The design of the game is both clever, as the player can affect the difficulty a lot with their own options and at the same time the game mechanics give the game itself a hard time. The reason I say this is that the content is vast, specially enemy-wise, but paced a bit slow.Thus the game can feel like a grind due to lack of persistancy between missions and reliance on unlockable content to customize your own sandbox game.A hit and miss sort of game with mostly solid design, enough that I would've expected to pay a little more for it.

But, the problems with the game are rarely ever considered acceptable.  You start off on a world map and as you clear out zones of zombies new zones with new mission objectives will show up.  However in many cases the objectives require you to complete other zones first.  An objective might be, ""complete this with the Commando class"" but... you don't have a commando class.... and there's no real restrictions on doing the mission without it.  You might waste an hour or two within any way of knowing that you can't possibly find someone with a 'commando' class.The game is very simple and can become repetitive fast.

When you end a turn, the zombies may well attack your defence turrets. If they make it past them you can choose to make a stand with your character (and team) and manually defend a barricade against them in an enjoyable defence shooter, likewise with taking a sector already occupied by zombies. Your character and team level up, acquire better weapons, skills and tools to use. Add random events and boss fights into the mix and the whole games comes together nicely.As time passes, more challenging zombie threats *cough* Emerge *cough*, and to keep up with the difficulty curve ramping up you need to be playing smartly. Meeting specific objectives by the time you finish a map unlocks further character classes to play, different challenges to complete and interesting perks to further add to your progression map to map. Losing your HQ loses the map, but not the game. You retain your unlocks and progression in a rogue-like fashion, so all is not lost.I see the developer has added a more forgiving difficulty setting for those who struggled, but I love my challenges to be as hardcore as it gets.

Simply because everything you do in this game reminds you of the microtransaction games...You are supose to expand your territory and recruit more people, recruit is no problem at all as long as you have enough money. But actually using these people for anything good is worse, you have to gather crystals to unlock slots on your team. And why they even bothered with that crap i cant understand.Also all the building you do is basicly like farms in phone/tablet games, get a area, build a farm, workshop e.t.c to get 1 x more resource which in total gives you this many resources e.t.c.Youll end up going in a bad circle to actually get somewhere in this game, grab 1 area, loose another to a huge hord, grab another area loose another to a huge hoard until you'we bothered doing it long enough to be strong enough to kill these hords.Hopefully they are still working on it and will fix / remove this crap in the future but as it is now its getting a thumbs down from me. And my advice is even though its cheap, buy something else cheap."

The recurring goal of the game is to secure different cities by reclaiming sectors within the city. Each reclaimed sectors allows for limited construction of resource-generating buildings, either providing much needed production for different types of automated defenses, research points for advanced technology, economy for purchases, or crystals for miscellaneous purposes including recruiting NPC survivors.Gameplay is sort of turn-based, whereby you spend limited Action Points to do things like scouting or taking over sectors. You may also spend APs to trigger random events, or activate one of several strategic options unlocked via research. At the end of your turn, zombies will move around and may incur upon your territory. When your automated defenses (if you choose ot build any) fail to fully eliminate the invading zombie, you and up to 4 recruited NPC teammates will be tasked to do the dirty work in some defense shooting action. Armed with one of several types of weapons, direct your reticule to approaching zombie hordes to gun them down before the barricade gets torn down and you get overrun. Kill enough zombies and you level up to gain a precious skill point to be put into either combat related skills or non-combat related skills such as increasing chances of finding survivors, or increasing resource production among other skills.What's good?-  It's a fun, casual game that tests your decision making ability and how one adapts to the random situations.What's bad?- Other than the moving zombie hordes during combat, everything else is pretty much static.- The AI of your comrades during combat is rather dubious, especially when it comes them them moving their aiming reticule, which isn't going to as fast as the player zipping their mouse around.- The random events will eventually loses it's novelty when you have read most of them, and all you are concerned is whether it's a positive or negative events.- Unless you are used to replaying to unlock perks and such, its get repetitive pretty fast.Million dollar question (or whatever price the game is), is it worth buying?The basic premise of the game doesn’t quite change and you are tasked with doing the same thing over and over again with additional challenging conditions, which might lead to gradual waning of interest if you decide to grind maps upon maps in one session. When played in moderated sessions, such as during coffee breaks or an hour or so before bedtime, it provides a satisfying amount of entertainment without causing addictive indulgence. Do remember that Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is what I consider a casual game, and while I often have no qualms about buying an indie game and supporting its developer, watching some Let's Play videos convinced me that this was worth a purchase for its price, and it is."

Like, maybe give the player some options during the explore action instead of just having it be pure RNG. And maybe have the opportunity to fight *alongside* your automated defenses to make them more effectve, rather than forcing you to mop things up. Or sally out to attack zombies even if you don't plan on capturing the sector.It was a neat premise, but it didn't quite get there for me. Can't recommend, but its not a *hard* thumbs down. Without a mixed option, though, I fall on the no side of recommending or not."

If you liked Rebuild, you will like this game.Review:Ok, so this appears to be a GameMaker game that took 4 years to develop. Kinda scary if you ask me.It sets you in post-apo metropolis where you reclaim sectors, manage your team and production, conquer moar areas and fight off zombies.Fighting is set in odd real-time setting, where hordes of walkers move onto you and you just fire on them from a fixed position from behind a barricade.Not as bad as it sounds, but I hope there is more to come.There are some more actions you can take based on ""action points"" (??) which produce good or bad results (or none).Graphicsis *passable* for such a small title, but resolution is basic 4:3 or 16:9 in almost lowest possible setting.Soundis kinda meh. Plasma rifle bolt hitting target reminded me of GemCraft monster death sound. Music is kinda annoying but at least it's not some rock or techno.Gameplaylefts a lot to be desired. There is a research, but it is very limited. There are other people to join your team, but you have to buy(wth??) team slot in order to put them there.Overalthis game is somewhere between 6 and 7 out of 10.There are currently bugs present, for example you cannot give found weapon to teammates, but you can create a gun out of thin air (basic gun costs you no cash).There is little to do for your team later apart from clicking 'explore'.Worst of all, when enemy attacks you automatically loose sector and can only choose to let it go or try to reclaim.Would be awesome to actually defend it along side of our automated turret.I give this game a thumbs upbecause I want bigger, better Rebuild.Right now there is not much to do in the game after certain period of time, but maybe if enough people gets interested the creator will be able to expand upon the content.Things currently not in the game:- No random cities with selectable difficulty that you can rebuild and then move onto the next one- No good team management (party slots, really?)- No nothing for your survivors to do when they are sitting in the recruit pool- No weapon change for your teammates- Unable to recruit guards and set them to patrol borders"

It's hard as nails yes, but I really enjoy the challenge it presents.The zombie genre is something I tend to avoid. Saturation is of this 'sub-genre' high. But when there's a turn based strategy aspect, it turns into something that actually appeals to me at least.Emerge is a game that has been criticised for being just another ""Browser game""... But I would say it's an unfair statement. Whilst some missions are a little repetitive, this can be avoided if you prefer to play games an hour or mission at a time instead of one long sitting. It also has enough of its own flavour in the gameplay and art style to stand up on its own.Plus with the low price tag, you can't really go wrong. If you like these kind of games, you will get bang for your buck... I've purchased full priced AAA games that have barely gotten 3-5 hours of play time out of me. So Emerge is certainly doing something right."
