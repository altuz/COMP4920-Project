,Recommended,457680,23245675,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,EdenStarGazer,"The Day I Found Opusa Sci-fi Indie Adventure game that will have you exploring, and seeing, the stars differently. I found Opus today, and of course played until I’d 100%ed the game. Though there are 31 achievies, they all come pretty normally through the story. By the time I’d finished the story, I had surveyed over 500 stars, which is the achievement just before the highest of 1000. But, I still had to locate a final supernova and a moon of one of the planets, along with the last 500 stars to survey, so that final count took a little grinding.Narrative:Story rich in a tantalizing and sentimental mystery, you are immersed in this charming tale of dreams, or goals. The title comes from the Latin phrase “Magnum Opus,” or “Great Work.” You start in a spaceship as a robot named Emeth. I’m totally unsure if that name comes from some Easter egg, or maybe it’s an acronym. But, two scientists are aboard with you and they are searching for the planet Earth, which was the origin of the human race, according to myth. They are growing doubtful they’ll find it, if it ever really existed, before they are too late to save mankind. The story presupposes that the gene pool has decayed to the point that survival is not expected. They need to return to Earth to collect more of their original genes. The robot is motivated by the female scientist to continue searching, despite the growing pessimism of the male scientist who is aboard with them. Then a power outage occurs, Lisa and the other scientist disappear, and a hologram of Lisa guides or assists Emeth in his search to find the missing planet Earth.Story Mechanic:Opus takes a single game mechanic that is also present in the new Stellaris, by Paradox Studios, and does it even better. Lisa, the female protagonist, has programmed Emeth to operate Opus’s telescope. Opus is the large ship they are inside. When you turn on the telescope, you are gazing at the stars and you are able to scan in search of habitable planets matching the characteristics of Earth. Meanwhile, the hud overhead displays tabs for your target coordinates, target section/sector, target zone, & filters needed. Just beneath the display of tabs is a button for the Earth Locator, which functions to guide you to each of your missions and sub-missions, target planets & stars to explore.The Earth Locator gives you clues to help you locate where the target star will be. You watch the display on your telescope and follow the degrees of rotation to calculate where you are, and where you need to be to find the target. This is comparable to flying an airplane by Instrument Flight Readings (IFR.) But, if you pay attention to the tabs at the top, each one lights up or turns off as you enter a zone or sector matching the description for your target, making it possible to just pilot “by the seat of your pants” as they say in Visual Flight Readings (VFR,) or flying by sight. If all the tabs are lit up, then you’ve found the right area. Also, a hint button will appear far right that will point you in the general direction, and you won’t find it too difficult.Comparisons:Other than the comparison to Stellaris in the way you explore the stars, I find this game reminded me very much of Firewatch. In Firewatch you were given realistic navigation tools to find your way around a map of the forest. Opus does likewise, but you’re searching through the galaxy. Also, Opus has an immersive mystery story much like Firewatch. And, it keeps you engaged until you finish the game.The developer, Team Signal, is an indie company that has a few mobile games thus far. I checked out a couple of them myself and found both Earthworm Alchemy and Hyper Square fun and free on my phone.Pros:Story RichEngaging & fun mechanics you’ll loveGraphics are nicely done in a cartoony style, No bugs or glitchesCould be fun for any age gamerDecent  SoundtrackGreat price at $8.99Cons:It is one simple aspect of exploration, but it does that extremely well.No strategy/ quite linear gameplayRequires meticulous patience for scanning a thousand stars.Final game section has major flashing lights that may be problematic for someI highly recommend Opus: The Day We Found Earth for anyone who loves stargazing, space, exploration, and solving mystery, while enjoying a strong immersive story.No Spoilers Here! I think the best way to play this game is to go into it spoiler free. So, I’ll leave my review at this."

And if you'd bother to check a little bit more you'll also find out the game last no longer than 2 hrs for average players. But in fact that's exactly part the point of this game:For a novel, fresh experience & gameplay in games, you don't absolutely need 50hrs of play time or super innovative, convoluted, unseen or complex mechanics to achieve those. There are all kinds of interesting short and interesting games in the indie scene right now that you won't regret paying 5 or 10 bucks on them. For 90 ~ 120 minutes of the gameplay, OPUS provides a quite touching, and even deep, philosophical experience, if you know what you are looking at.I am an avid space-themed media junkie, so the astronomical side of OPUS also highly interests me. But there's a thin layer of somewhat deceiving sugarcoat there, if I may say so. The scientific detail or the accuracy of terms and descriptions in the game sometimes doesn't add-up, even though improvements have already been made since the mobile version. But again, that's not really the point.I am going to boldly claim that the game's astronomical / science aspect is only there to support it's narrative, just like Interstellar (YES, THAT CHRIS NOLAN MOVIE) -- even more, the central idea of OPUS can actually draw a few parallel comparison from Interstellar directly.You know right from the beginning of the game, that hundred of thousands years into the distant future, human race has somehow forgotten its origin, and Earth has long become a myth. And one important character in game totally doesn't believe there is even an Earth at all. Just like in Interstellar, the general public has long ""disapprove"" the idea that human has been to the Moon and beyond, and no one believe in any of those grand idea anymore.Of course, I am not really claiming that a small indie team can produce something that really rivals a worldly-acclaimed award-winning Hollywood movie, nor does it take as serious an approach to science as the Nolan film to cover its philosophical / spiritual ideas, but it's already an effort very rarely seen in games, in my opinion.To say anything more about the narrative or story about OPUS would be a huge spoiler for the game itself, so I'll stop here. I only hope that my review can help you look into the game a little bit more, before you start nitpicking its problems. The game is not expensive, it will not cost you a lot of time and energy, the gameplay is smooth and I think the difficulty curve is just right for this kind of experience. So by all means try it out for yourself!EDIT: typo"

I think it amounted to a 70% completion from what the game told me.I much like the theme of a robot trying to complete a task it was given by its master in the absence of said master/mother. It had a lot of potential for exploring the development of human like AI in the event of isolation. But the story left me wanting.With the characters in question it feels like the movie ""AI"", only instead of facing and overcomming challenges while trying to find your mom, you sit in a room and point at numbered dots on a map while someone else tries to find your mom.All in all it still was a nice experience though and had some good atmosphere, art and interface designs.The price seems a bit much considering the playtime, but I have payed more money on food with less entertainment value."

It's like a hidden object game that has an arrow pointing to your next object.  At least 10 minutes of the 90 minutes play time was simply being shunted back to the ship screen after every find, watching a progress bar, and then having to go back to the telescope mode.  The majority of the sparse dialogue amounts to either ""I'm gonna do it!"" or ""When is mommy coming home?"", and reads like a children's book.  Mildly atmospheric, but compares poorly in that regard to walking simulators."

,Recommended,457680,22789082,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,Fenrakk101,"OPUS is a wonderful experience, and I highly recommend it. The story isn't flawless, but it did succeed in nearly bringing me to tears, which is still something only a few games have accomplished - and it achieved that in under an hour and a half. If you're not someone who inherently hates iOS ports, you'll find something to love in OPUS.That being said, I'm much better at writing criticisms, and I do have a major gripe with the game. When starting the story, you are prompted to choose between ""Normal Mode"" and an easier ""Story Mode"": Normal Mode promises to hold your hand less, while Story Mode promises to carry you through the story as painlessly as possible. So I chose Normal Mode, of course, but then it never actually felt like the game let my hand go. The story progresses by scanning specific planets, which the game points you directly towards - it points you to a general area where the star can be found, and the star is always the brightest one there. Even when those areas become larger, the game provides you a means to narrow the search down to a handful yet again, meaning you can realistically complete the game without ever scanning a ""wrong"" system, even on your first playthrough.As soon as you scan one planet, you are immediately told where the next one is. First, this raises a lot of serious questions about the plot - how did they ever have trouble finding Earthlike planets when they're so helpfully mapped out for you? But even purely as a gameplay mechanic, I believe it genuinely detracted from my experience. More than anything, it actively discouraged me from exploring the actual map: the characters are constantly pattering about how they desperately need to scan the next planet, and the next planet is always right in front of you, so what kind of jerk would make them wait so you can go look for that supernova you just found out about? It also makes the whole scanning mechanic seem completely pointless; if you ever scan an incorrect planet, you feel like you've only wasted your time (more on that in a moment). I would have much preferred a mechanic where you would be told an even broader area to scan in, and you would need to randomly scan planets in the area to find clues to the next candidate - a reason to actually make you want to look around. As it stands, by the time the story gets to the ""we're now desperate so we need to look fast"" section, I didn't really feel much pressure, since I had felt pressured to rush the story scans from the very beginning.And about scans being pointless: why on Earth is there an achievement for scanning 1000 systems? As mentioned, you'll probably get through the story with barely over 25 scans, and extra scans up to that points were already a waste of time; what's the point in asking players to sit around for 2.5 hours clicking on star after star, just so they can see the ""that's not Earth, stupid"" message pop up hundreds of times? I really wish developers would stop adding achievements that may as well read ""do a boring and repetitive task over and over and over for us.""Closing statements on OPUS: Did you miss the first paragraph? Go buy OPUS, it's a beautiful, if brief, title. I only criticize it so much because I'm an obnoxious prick, and I believe giving games a free pass on critique just because they're indie or because they're iOS ports is fairly patronising."

Apparently the gene pool has run dry and you have to find your way back to Earth to find more genes. Click a planet to find, it tells you the co-ordinates, you move the telescope there and press space, and discover the system is not Sol. Repeat for 2 hours until you find earth."

76561198047495857,Recommended,457680,28648797,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,OdanUrr,"An enjoyable experience overall even if it's lacking in certain areas. You're OP1414, also known as Emeth, a small, childlike, robot who has been tasked with finding planet Earth by using a space telescope called 'OPUS.' This is what you'll find yourself doing for the most part of the game, searching amongst hundreds of stars for the location of humanity's first abode. While certainly a repetitive experience it can also be quite cathartic at times, as you do some stargazing to a very relaxing soundtrack, encountering alien planets, galaxies, and even supernovas.Unfortunately, I found the concept was not developed to its full potential. What do I mean by that? After beating the game you unlock a new mission that has you tracking down the creators of Emeth's power armor through OPUS. I really enjoyed this short side-quest which had you play detective while teaching you a thing or two about light and space. I felt the game could've used more of these side-quests and that the characters should've been more reactive to Emeth's discoveries.That brings us to my second point. Assisting Emeth in his search for Earth is a holographic AI named Lisa, modeled after the Doctor who created Emeth. Emeth is reluctant to accept the help of this ""fake Doctor"" at first but eventually they reach some sort of understanding, though their interaction is still quite limited. However, this prompts Emeth to ask a simple yet poignant question, where is the Doctor? I was really looking forward to solving this mystery, even if I felt the answer was fairly obvious. And yet, despite the fact that you find clues here and there hinting at what could have happened, you never get the full picture. At the very least I wasn't able to put the pieces of the puzzle together, leaving me clueless as to what happened to Emeth's beloved Doctor.As a result, because AI Lisa and Emeth have very little interaction, and because the mystery of what happened to the Doctor is not resolved, I found that we didn't have enough (time and material) to bond with these characters. Furthermore, and I don't think I'm spoiling anything that the title of the game hasn't already spoiled, the game comes to an abrupt ending after you finish your mission, and it's an unsatisfying one at that. It's a shame because the ending could've been so much better if it had added a short scene with AI Lisa, rounding up the Doctor's fate at the same time.I was also disappointed that something as simple as zooming out or having a space chart at hand wasn't available, what makes locating your objectives more time-consuming than necessary (there's a hint system though).In the end, I'm afraidOPUS: The Day We Found Earthdidn't quite hit me emotionally as it did other players. While a beautiful game to play for a short while (it took me about 3 hours to complete), its narrative is a bit on the weak side, making the day I found Earth not as engaging as it could've been.Recommended at a discount."

I'm going red thumb for balance reasons since there are already so much positive reviews explaining why you should buy this game.If you did not read any of those here's a TL;DR : Great atmosphere (especially the music), unique experience, nice story and lovable characters. If that's enough for you, go ahead and buy this game. The bonus developer commentary you get is a nice touch as well.However i feel like this game have a poor lifespan to price ratio. You can rush through the story in like 2 hours. Took me 8 hours to get 100% (some idle time included, probably possible in less than 5) but that's with a very stupid achievement which requires 1000 stars scanned. I only went for it because i kinda have achievement OCD. Wasnt that long but it was tedious and very unnecessary.There is no challenge whatsoever even in the ""normal"" difficulty setting. The gameplay is original but repetitive. It's not exactly a visual novel but yeah the emphasis is on the story, not the gameplay.Also i dont know if it's just me but at some point the telescope is damaged which makes your screen shaky and it really ♥♥♥♥ed up my eyes and damaged my immersion.So whether you should buy this game or not really depends on what you're looking for."

76561198022266051,Recommended,457680,29437244,Posted: 22 January,all,OakenPants,"Now this was cool.It's basically an very enjoyable, charming, narrative story where inbetween brief episodes of story telling (provided through text-bubbles, but very well written) you explore stars that could potentially be where Earth is.  To explore the stars, you view through the telescope and move across the starry sky and have the computer scan the star on the cross hairs --- but you don't scan just any stars.  You're told which star you are to scan -- so it's your job to navigate the telescope to that named sector and then to those given coordinates in that sector and scan a star inthatarea.  It'll usually find a planet and score it's likeness to Earth, and give you an opportunity to name the planet you discovered.After every scan it returns to the spaceship view of the game where the story resumes (usually), or if not, you can return to the telescope to search for Earth around another star, or click on a few things around the ship gathering information and back story that way.The graphics in the game I thought were very well done making it enjoyable to navigate the telescope across the night sky, but really, it's the story that shines in this game.Overall:  This was a great, albeit very short at 1.7 hrs to complete, point-n-click adventure game that is very well done with a great story.  8.5 out of 10."

Click... and that's it !People would say that I'm missing the story in the game. Yeah yeah, the story is nice. If the purpose of the game is to make you loose some time in between the scenes so that you can get the feeling of being stubornly dedicated to your task and feel like the main character in the game, well, alright... but that's not really fun. Maybe the only incite you'll have is to discover what happened and go through all the space search for that though, not really worth it, no challenge and even probably a bit annoying too.Repetition... If only there was some progression in the mechanisms of the game but it's almost a repeated action during all the game and the pace of the game is slooooow.I do not write often negative reviews but I really felt like the overall good feedback on this game (which convinced me to buy the game) needed to be balanced down, so here is my contribution to reduce the obviously too high score of this game.Anyway, I do not recommend buying this game despite all the love the dev probably put in it."

Unfortunately, the story is pretty predictable, and since you get a new bit of plot dialogue after each newly discovered planet, it becomes a little tiresome to see the inevitable reveal drawn out, especialy since one of the characters has already figured it out.The game play has a few minor drawbacks as well. The sky is split into a number of non-uniform zones and sectors, which makes keeping a point of reference difficult. This is extra rough, because new points of interest only include directions from the closest way point, so if you've decided to track down one of the optional objects, you may have to back track through all of the previously discovered planets to figure how to get back to where you were."

After many years of genetic engineering, the human gene pool has been deteriorating, however, and the only way to save it is to find samples on Earth.

OPUS is an hour and a half of moving a cursor around a map and pressing space on the brightest spot in the region the game points you to. Doing so rewards you with some generic drawings of a handful of planet types and other cosmic structures, but there are seemingly none to find outside of those required for the story or side quests. Since the story also takes you to every interesting megastructure on the map, there's really very little to explore. In spite of this, one achievement requires scanning 1,000 planets, which is at least 10-20 times more than what's necessary to complete a full game, and 950 of them will just be ""Similarity: Low""The story is competent, but unambitious.

I was actually quite surprised that the end was the least interesting between all the ideas of an ending that I would have thought about. Too bad...I was also a bit turned off by the repetitive nature of being forced after each successful scan to get back to the ship screen in order to follow the next phase of the story.There seem to be some lose ends in the story with all the missing notes and such, which I couldn't find anywhere. It felt that I get clues for non-existing puzzles.I took my time a bit playing the game, using the more ""challenging"" mode and did not rush straight to the end of the story. I just wanted to explore a bit around, but in the end, I didn't quite understood what was the game expecting of me, gameplay wise, besides completing some achievements.Overall it felt that the game tried to do more than be just a ""walking simulator"" and compromised a bit too much to achieve that goal.It is a keeper for me, but I can't really recommend it."

,Not Recommended,457680,22747169,"Posted: 1 May, 2016",all,Tag Wolf,"Developers or Moderators deleted forum post which contained feedback and feature requests I thought would be beneficial to making gameplay more interesting.This is the first time I've had this happen. Maybe it was a mistake, I can't say. But as I get the impression they do not appreciate user feedback, I cannot recommend the game on that alone. However even if that wasn't the case, in my suggestions I brought up several things that impact this game in a negitive way.This game has a pretty solid story. But the pacing it terrible.You play a small robot looking for earth. You search for it by aligning your telescope using the mouse or keyboard to grid coordinates or a general ""In this area kinda"", type instructions given to you by the computer.You scan stars in the area you think the match is in until you find a planet that is a high percentage match of earth, but is not really earth.You do this over and over again, with little variation in play, in between each star, you are shown a view of the ship and read through some dialogue, mostly about how the robot misses it's friend.Your character appears in multiple locations on the ship as you progress and unlock new areas. However, these areas serve no other purpose in the game besides a different background to read more dialogue.I felt like there are so many missed opportunities that would have made this a great game.For example, incorporating zoom and focus into the telescope. Piloting the ship and repositioning it. Really, by the 10th planet that wasn't earth, I was really feeling antsy and begging for the game to give me some other task to do.Bestowed upon you about 1/3rd through the game, is a computer aided locator, which lights up on average 3-5 possible stars that are the one you need to scan. This actually made the game even less fun because it removed difficulty from gameplay instead of increasing it.Towards the end, you are given one new mechanic. It consists of a filter, which shows something similar to IR light when looking at space. The game has you use this about 3 times total before the end of the game and tells you when you need to use it.Really I understand wanting a story based game and a casual experience. But in my opinion the dialogue felt more like it took me out of the experience more than made me hopeful to hear more story. This is mainly because you listen to more dialogue in the game after EVERY SCAN of an earthlike planet. Which means about once every 2 minutes. Most of this dialogue is not worth interrupting the player, showing the ship, and going through more dialogue.This filler dialogue should be spaced out and for the non essential stuff, it should happen while you are looking for things and during scanning.Once you finish the story. You unlock Normal mode. Where you can spend time clicking on random stars and scanning them. All gameplay functions in both Story and Normal Mode are as follows: Pan Up/Down/Left/Right, Filter On/Off, Scan.This gameplay mode offers you nothing new, other than to continue scanning the 100,000,000 star systems in the game and naming them. Literally the most feedback the game offers is a random percentage of how close that planet is to earth, a picture, and a description of why it doesn't support life or isn't like earth. Once you finish the story I don't see much point in playing in normal because at the core, it just isn't varied enough to be fun.I think this had so much potential. I am sad to see parts of this game that just have a failed execution. I hope the developers rethink some of the mechanics and make the experience a bit more captivating and varied. All the foundations are there. If they do I'll be sure to change my review.Currently however, this plays more like a visual novel with a hidden object mini-game. That would be the best way to go into this I think.I will give the game credit though. It does have a really nice graphical feel. Soothing music. A unique direction and above all, it's got a lot of heart. But for the reasons above, that heart just isn't enough for me. I would give it shot if scanning the sky in the game in a casual and very basic fasion sounds fun to you, but I think that after the story you'll probably never touch it again. That is what bums me out because this has an opportunity to be something really special."

However it's not a game, so I found myself instead comparing it to novels and films.  Compared to them it it is pretty shallow.  It held my attention mostly because I wanted to find out how it ended, and I found the conclusion unsatisfactory.I do congratulate the developers on the attempt, and I hope to see more games that explore what is possible with interactive fiction like this.

I'm surprised to find out the pictures on the wall, Lisa's notes and books, the name of stars and planets discovered by Lisa now all make sense. More deeply the game is full of metaphors. If you read carefully, the name and symbols for each zone and sections, the default name of the stars, the room background in the spaceship are all meaningful! I'll stop here rather than spoil it.

I complete it in 69 minutes. Seriously, the experienec does not worth the price at all.2: Boring and NOT innovative (for an indie game)I know this is the first game of OPUS's developers and they mark it as an indie game. But what I want to say is that when you put the word INDIE in front of a game, it DOES NOT NECESSARILY make it an innovative game. Indie games are known for being innovative, but indie game DOES NOT EQUAL innovative.For what I can sense in this game, the developer try to gain a title of ""Innovation"" simply by putting the operation of usual astronomy apps (such as Stellarium) into the game play. It is good for one to think of those astronomy apps when you try to make a game of a robot observing the sky through a telescope, but not enough.You'd get bored VERY QUICKLY after playing it for some time. I, personally, is an astronomy lover. I operate telescope, observe the sky and take pictures, but still, it made me bored. I bought the game in the beginning because I saw the trailer and all its screenshots. They're beautiful and real, if you wonder, but that's it. Nothing more. Literally no meaningful interaction within the game, transitions between gameplay and CG are awkward. What you do is repeatedly move ur wasd to find a star, with some plot that does not touch your heart at all.I did not buy this game to have two Stellarium in my computer.But still, the OSTs inside the games are good.

This game does a very good job at keeping you at suspense and then giving you little hints as to the happenings of the world around your characters. The two main protagonists in this game are very humorous and reminds me highly of Wall-E and EVA from the movie Wall-E.The gameplay is simple but it works very well. You won't get confused at it too much and there's always a little 'Hint' button to direct you in the general direction of the area you need to check out although that might be due to Story mode and not the other mode.The music amplifies the gameplay experience a lot. It's a HUGE difference to be able to play this game with the music and without it. It really set the atmosphere and assisted in the narrative of the game as well.Now the game isn't really too long, around 2-3 hours in one entire session until you reach the end. Double that if you play the other mode as well to find all the collectibles and other scraps of the story.In fact I'd say this game would be criminal to charge me so much for such a short game but I forgive it. Why? The story affected me, the music affected me, and those were the goals of the developers as they have stated themselves. They achieved that goal with me and thus, I'd say my money was well spent. I even bought the soundtrack.And the ending is one of those endings that you'll love but wish there were more."

After all the Dev's made a great game and I will look into future games of those guys."

,Recommended,457680,22623405,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,13thsymphony,"OPUS is a short and sweet experience - about 2.5 hours for my completionist run, just right.The core gameplay mechanic is a simple but unique mix of ""find the hidden object"" and map memorization, of all things. You operate a futuristic space telescope and are tasked with finding a series of planets and other astronomical objects given only a very incomplete skymap, some cryptic hints, and a couple of magic decoder keyring-style tools.This might sound monotonous, but there is sufficient variety and the game had a well balanced difficulty ramp. More importantly, I was always highly motivated to find each new planet in order to unlock the next chapter of the story. The plot and setting form the core of this game - if not that unique or groundbreaking, it was still very touching and well written. You start out with the goal of (re)discovering the long lost planet Earth in order to save a distant future version of humanity, but this cliched opening quickly gives way to more personal motivations. The story and characterizations are revealed through a combination of dialog, found artifacts, and flashbacks - once again, quite sparse but effective at letting you fill in the details of what happened in the past.Some technical issues were my only real complaints. On my Surface Pro 3, the cinematics were inexplicably very choppy (probably less than 5 frames per second for what I assume would be a 24fps movie); in addition, there was an alarmingly high number of typos - ""hybernation"", missing prepositions, incorrect plurals, etc. But they don't detract heavily from a well worthwhile experience."

This is not an action filled game, nor is it 'hard' per se. What it is a nice story-driven game where you have to find certain planets/stars/other. It's nice and relaxing, and worth a look."

Very repetitive and mindless gameplay. But if you're looking for an easy 100% achievement game (slightly time consuming), this is one for you."

Some might say it's too short but I don't think so. There is a freeplay mode that you unlock at the end and hidden/unlockable items to find so I think it's good value for money. Definitely give it a shot if you are looking for something a little different.

Simple gameplay, sort of like the scanning mini game from Mass Effect, but more detailed as you drag the mouse around a massive star map to look for Earth. Of course the main star is Emeth, the touchingly cute and child-like robot that expresses so much love and longing. He's innocent but grumpy, dedicated but irritable...you'll fall in love with him and with the supporting characters. A simple but wonderful experience, with superb music and pick up and go elegance, since it saves on exit. I give OPUS a 9/10"

One playthrough can be completed in under two hours, and since the story and puzzles are so simple, it doesn't have much replay value. But it's great as a break from longer, more intense games. I'd recommend buying it on sale. It's also worth noting that this game has rapidly changing lights and colors at certain points, so if you're sensitive to flickering lights, this might not be the game for you."

After scanning Earth, the screen shows the satellite going into hyper speed, then the screen goes black and occasionally shows dialogue of LISA with a happy face talk to Emeth. The same dialogue that is said before scanning Earth. Can anyone help me with this? Is it a bug, or am I supposed to press something?Other than that, OPUS: The Day We Found Earth was a great game.

,Recommended,457680,33184805,Posted: 3 July,all,LonM,"A nice game. A bit short if you just burn right through the main story objectives. The story itself is good, although the main character can seem a little whiny at times. But I guess given the situation, that's part of the point. Music, art and interface design is all good. Gameplay is good when you're trying to complete an objective but it would get a bit boring or repetitive post-completion."

The story is the best ive seen in a long time. One thing though apart from the stars that the radar detects as part of the story there arent any high low range planets to detect on your own. Maybe something to think about in the future but for now I think it should be priced more than it is. What no mans sky could have been if it was 2D. :)
