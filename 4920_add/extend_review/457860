Apollo 11 VR was a wonderful, emotional experience and totally worth the price of admission.As a developer also working in VR, I've tried dozens of VR experiences, and this is one of my favorites. Highly recommend."

Although it's pretty short (played through in just under 1 1/2 hours with interaction mode enabled) the production values and attention to detail are nothing short of amazing and it really shows what the future of learning will be like in the coming years :) Would recommend this to anyone.
,Recommended,457860,22820568,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,voodoodrul,"This has some great moments but it could have been better. For single purpose, limited scope experiences like this, I expect higher quality assets. Textures are lacking, especially orbital and ascent views of the Earth and Moon. The feeling of presence inside the spacecraft is excellent, but just when you want to reach out and flip a switch you realize you can't. The lunar surface is lacking in detail - this is only marginally better than any random spot on the Mun in Kerbal. Don't get me wrong, this has great moments. The Saturn V assembled for launch is great just for the scale of the thing. But as a paid VR experience, focusing on less than an hour's worth of content, I think the bar should be higher. The lunar surface needs footprints and regolith that gives way. There needs to something to do for ascent and docking with the command module for return."
,Recommended,457860,26546403,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,Qix,"The Apollo 11 VR Experience gives you a close sense of what it was like for the astronauts on the first moon landing in 1969. You see everything either from the viewpoint of one of the astronauts, or from nearby. It brings out the unusual and disorientating effects of being in orbit. You get to try spinning the lander round to attach it to the command module and landing on the moon from orbit, which is not easy, I can tell you. This part is basically a flight simulator. Once on the moon, you get to check out Tranquility Base and find out about the experiments they performed up there. There are also a couple of easter eggs for you to find, including a cache of recordings from people connected with the VR project. Finally you return to Earth and splash down in the ocean.It took me 2.7 hours to complete, but you could just watch it in about half an hour as a VR experience without struggling to complete the flight sim parts or explore the moon. If you enjoy the scientific endeavour of space exploration, you will no doubt enjoy Apollo 11 VR. If not, you may find it boring. I found it to be an immersive simulation, so I'd recommend it as just that, without suggesting it's really good fun or anything."
,Not Recommended,457860,28436617,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,Ganerumo,"I saw this game on sale at a somewhat random occasion on the store, and was at first quite interested in the concept.This, however, turned out to be a very underwhelming experience, and the first genuinely BAD vr experience I've had overall.So let's start from the top, with a simple question: does this game deliver on its promises, ALL of its promises ?The short answer is no. Now for the long answer.Apollo 11 VR sells itself as ""a new type of documentary"", but a documentary it is not. What it is, is a short, undercooked project with no genuine lasting impact, and very little short term fun or entertainment to be had. There is relatively little in the ways of information or factoids to be learned here, save for a fairly inelegant info dump in one of the later scenes. The ""mix of original archive audio and video"" is used in a rather unpleasant way as well - rather than here to complement visuals and audio, it feels closer to a tacky attempt at simulating historical fidelity, and it gets old very quick.Another issue comes in the form of very limited interaction. The store page mentions several critical sections of the game being interactive, and well, it isn't lying - you CAN take control of the command modules, the lunar lander and explore the moon's surface, but it is extremely limited. Perhaps the comparison is a bit harsh to make, but I expected from those sequences something akin to a simplified Kerbal Space Program, and it is in some aspects - but there is so little to do, in such small capacity, that one has to wonder if there even is a point to putting this here to begin with.The issue of visual fidelity also needs to be addressed. Apollo 11 VR goes for the laziest, most basic direction possible in terms of graphics, and persists on being just kind of mediocre graphically. It doesn't take a lot of trickery to make even average assets on an accessible engine look stunning and this application tries to utilize none of them, which is made worse by the fairly immersion breaking oddities one may come across, such as spinning lense flares or the lifeless eyes of the few human models one gets to see.The most drastic problem that overarchs all of those is that Apollo 11 VR feels uninspired, flat and basic - more than a shame considering it is set out to pay tribute to one of mankind's most significant accomplishements of the last century. This won't make you love NASA or space faring or the inventivity of man. If you already love those things, it won't give you a new perspective on them - in fact, if you're into building space shuttles and sending them out into space, you're better off playing Kerbal Space Program, which has practically everything game offers sans the overdone ""inspirational music"" and without pretending to be historically accurate about anything.One last problem about the game, as a VR title: it can be potentially very nauseating for some people. I have the huge advantage of not suffering from any motion sickness in VR, but those few scenes and panning shots of the moon or of planet earth can be extremely dizzying, and I can imagine that people who are more sensitive to the effects of motion sickness would not be able to get through these sequences without taking off the headset. A particular early sequence in which the player is set through a fly-by shot of the shuttle prepped for take-off is very uncomfortable, but doesn't really offer any of the thrill that one may expect from literally flying around a shuttle the height of a downtown appartment building.As for longevity, well, I don't think it's quite as important as some may expect from a game like this that tries to be more of a set experience than something you'd go back to, but it struggles to reach 60 minutes. I hopped around the surface of the moon for as long as I could take it before getting bored at the complete absence of activites (don't trust the whole ""deploy experiments"" thing, there is no moving of parts or assembly required, just one press of a button and models magically pop up), and still couldn't get to make this last more than an hour.It could have been a lot longer, and a lot better, if more creativity had been employed in the making of the interactive segments, which in themselves should have been more numerous. Not to be an ideas guy, but I expected a lot more from it - I've got a set of controllers that allow me to grab several things at once, twist them around and whatnot, so I expected the devs to do what plenty  of other games do and let me take the whole shuttle apart to see how it's build, or let me deploy those experiments by hand, or physically move the controls and push buttons inside of the shuttle, but there's none of that.To finish this review, I'd simply like to reiter my earlier recommendation of KSP for those of you who wanted to pick this one up as a semi-simulator of sorts. If you just want a simple demo to show off VR, there's plenty more options that fit the function more than this one, a lot of which are FREE."

,Recommended,457860,23393039,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,Astrobia,"I feel like this title deserves recommending but begrudgingly so.It is passably well made and there is value to it, but only in a specific niche.It's not a simulation, it's kind of a documentary, but not really. As ride alongs on rockets go it's somewhat lackluster and definately lacks any replayability of it's compitors. Objects in the game are well modelled but often the low quality textures take you out of the experience. As it stands the visuals are okay. The strongest thing it has going for is it's use of music to set the mood. It's also quite short.On the one hand, this is one of the first VR experiences of its type and that is applaudable. Additionally the small user base for VR means it's got to be hard to recoop development costs... But even so it feels overpriced. See even as a VR headset user I'm not going to get anything more out of this and I got little it of it as it was. It's a good demo for showing off to friends to give them an idea of where VR experiences are headed... But it's nothing spectacular in it's own right.Unless of course you know nothing about the Apollo 11 mission, never heard the JFK speech before, generally experienced little of the moon landing media... Then it's a rather impressive introduction to those things. As a one off.But for the same money you could buy 3 feature length movies on the topic just as moving and inspiring if not more so. Is it fare to compare the product of a small studio to Hollywood productions? Does that alone justify paying more? That's up to the consumer.One area they had the chance to stand out was the interactive sequences. Unfortunately experiences are super simplistic and dumbed down or otherwise limited by the controls, plus few and far between. There are a lot of almost unnecassary drawn out external camera shots which while setup to set the mood, would be much more compelling if the player was given control durin them, to take them at their own pace and explore as they will.That's not to say I don't think the developer hasn't put effort in. But while they are showing off some of the strengths of the medium they are drasticly underutilising others. There is some educational value to the product and it does stand up as a ""demo"" but it's not much more then that. I also definately want the developer to make their money back on it so we can see more such VR experiences and better ones as the medium is explored more.As it stands, unless you have a lot of friends you are trying to show VR off to, have teenagers in the household or are really obsessed with the American space program... I'd wait till this product is on sale. Hopefully when it is it will sell well."

,Recommended,457860,29876541,Posted: 12 February,all,[F.T.L.]Shadow404,"This was a truly moving experience. I cried happy tears multiple times. Love the interactive sequences. Graphics are amazing on my 960M card. VR was really well done for the VIVE.A few suggestions about the accuracy that could use some fixing:1. Helmets were being worn and the astronauts were holding/carrying their oxygen generator while on the ride up  the Launch Tower Elevators.2. Would be cool to see them get into the Command module and shake the hands of the white room operators. (especially Günter Wendt's (wiki that name for a really cool story)).3. During the Interactive Docking sequence:- Add an ability to reverse thrust translation on the RCS, I only saw a forward thrust on the instructions.- Add RCS fuel guage read out on the PAD Computer as well as a goal to stay above in the mission goals. Also add this functionality to the analog dial/guage on the instrument board.- The command module had a radar range finder for docking sequences, and you would have seperation distance and closure rate read out in meters/sec on the computer. Advise what the ideal meters/sec is for the goal (right now its vauge) and included a functional read out of both values.4. During the LEM seperation sequence, they would seperate in Earth view for COMMs. But during the film sequence, they were out of Earth view, so they would not have comms? LOS/AOS. Would recommend at least an Earth Rise for this portion to make it more accurate before SEP.5. Remaining RCS fuel would be dumped shortly after main or drag chute deployment, yet Guages still showed values for the RCS fuel on the instrument board with the Parachutes deployed???6. No Radio signal possible while the command module was going through re-entery ionization.....so how did they get a response the from the Apollo module while they were still going through this ionization? The radio contact audio was actually after the drag chutes were deployed, so matching the audio up during the correct re-entry sequence would be a simple fix.7. During the PAN around the Saturn 5 rocket, before getting on the Elevator, add LOX vapor burnoff around the rocket body, this would make for a more detailed experience showing the rocket body all chilled down from the cryogenic fuel ready to blast off.Otherwise, this was an amazing, awe-inspriring experience, and takes a space history buff to really tear apart the small in-accuracies that I found. Overall, this studio did an amazing job, well worth the price!!!!!!!!"

This is the reason you buy VR, and I don't mean it from a campy experience.  This is a deep, educational journey that inspires.When I bought this, I expected it to be the 3D-TV-like videos of flash and no substance.  This is everything but.  It's worth every penny and beyond and it's the first path I take people down when they start asking about the value of VR.If you're ready to experience the challenges of capturing the LM, walking (and landing on) the moon, and want a view of Earth that makes you feel ""there"" instead of all those nice pictures that try to encapsulate it, you are in for a ride.  This ""game' (?) makes me want to walk around with my rig and Oculus and make people watch.  It's impossibly good."
,Recommended,457860,24676766,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,CaptainKoloth,"Oh my goodness. What an amazing experience. I literally teared up at the incredible experience I had as I rode the Saturn V into orbit in the Apollo command module with Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins; like almost nothing else I’ve experienced in VR to date, I really, truly felt like I was there. This review is based on an Oculus Rift and GTX 1080 for reference.As a VR early adopter AND a longtime crazed Apollo buff, this seemed like exactly the program for me. And it IS! Sitting in an Apollo command module cockpit or standing in the lunar module on approach to a lunar landing, my jaw dropped at the fidelity and accuracy of what I was seeing- it really was like being transported into From the Earth to the Moon. I was especially impressed and happy to see the extremely accurate switches in the various cockpits and background audio.The “game” parts of it are decent but not extraordinary; come for the ability to experience an Apollo launch in an extremely accurate and lifelike presentation of an Apollo capsule, or to land on the Moon with Neil and Buzz actually standing in their place in an exactly correct lunar module interior.The lunar surface portion could use some better graphical fidelity; it was a little jarring after how excellent the in-spacecraft elements were.Pacing is a little all over the place; with some very long external views which tend to be slightly less interesting to me alternating with the in-cockpit content, but it is all extremely impressive and well-made.I would have liked a mode in which you can just sit in the cockpits and look around, and perhaps some interactivity with some of the switches – perhaps this can be added in the future. But as an interactive, you are there VR version of From the Earth to the Moon- look no further."

The historical audio adds a lot to the experience, and the sense of scale rivals any footage or movie I've seen on the subject.  This is a fanstastic experience to share with anybody who isn't the slightest bit interested in video games.  When I thought about how amazing our trip to the moon was, I was even brought to tears if joy.The main downfall is the graphics, which don't do much to give you a sense that you are actually beholding the amazing sights you are ostensibly witnessing, which is a shame.   Other little touches like the lack of lipsyncing when doing the moon landing were a letdown, but the experience is worth it despite these pitfalls for those with an interest in space or anybody wanting to show an older person what VR can do.There is an interactive portion of the experience, but it was far too challenging for content of this type.  While it instilled me with respect for those that actually pulled off these miraculous feats, the repeats resulting from failure disrupted the flow.  My advice: experience it non-interactively first, then try your hand and landing on the moon on a subsaquent.Overall, I would say if you are at the point of reading reviews for this, then you will most certainly enjoy it.  It is overpriced, but that's how VR software is today, and this experience stands out from most VR shovelware on it's historical and educational merits.  It would be amusing to me if the Russians made a version with their space stuff and spent more on the graphics, which is the only way I think it could be improved.  Maybe the developers will add an HD texture pack or something to jazz up the blandness of the moonscape in future updates and offer a Low and High setting in the menu."

It has probably the best music from any VR game I've ever played.Also, the end sequence allows you to free roam on the moon, and I normally get motion sick with trackpad controller movement, but this didn't make me motion sick at all.Only nitpicky things for me is that part way through, my vive controllers became no longer visible, and the selecting of objects and menus became controlled by the headset and also that I would have liked more specific instructions on how to complete the lunar landing.Overal though, this was spectacular and cinimatic and I look forward to what else comes from these guys."

There are 3 stages where you can take control - the landing on the moon is best one to take over, although I miss the lack of briefing on all the interactive stages.Generally, I want to criticize the lack of information throuout the ride. Of course they tried to make it as real as possible, but sometimes it would habe been nice, to get more background information and not just ride along and listen to the recorded radio transmissions. I think they should continue to develop this experience and add more interaction to it, as well more information.- graphics / design- not a lot of information+ soundtrack, even though it would be cool to turn it off completely.Suggestions* introduce a ""hardcore"" mode to do the whole experience in VR (no cuts, no music, no external views)* more technical information about the whole mission and especially about the procedures for the single stages.Fair warning: I got motion sick the first time with the VIVE when I was on the moon using the beaming feature."

For example, the camera accelerates at random which produces an involuntary weird feeling in your stomach and knees. It's distracting. The movement does not use the HTC Vive controllers but your look angle, it's gross. The whole things is just akwardly staped together.The interactive sections were boring and also half baked. Nothing about this demo is really interactive.The trying-to-be-impressive shots of earth felt fake in their low resolutionness and their very obvious planarity. It was really hard to get into it.I kindof somewhat liked the part on the moon as they do tell you a bit about what the mission was like and what the experiments did, and also the part where you are inside the launch and the lander were kind of fun. But again there is absolutely no attention given to any detail. Buzz Aldrin jumps around and doesn't care to jump through rocks, because they are all just fake props.

Control on lunar landing is limited at best with little ability to use reaction control and no ability to throttle thrust.  If you overshoot landing slightly you go beyond the range of the game.

The coolest virtual field trip I've ever taken.Landing on the moon took a lot of tries, but I eventually made it down. A few things to note: you're initially off-center to the left, so you need to immediately start thrusting to the right to get lined up, or you'll fail because you ""flew too far away"". Your lander is automatically thrusting upwards at a steady amount; your job is to control the angle to adjust your forward speed and descent. The thrust (up on the analog stick) is to help slow your descent, but thrusting kills your vertical velocity fairly quickly, so don't use it too much initially or you won't descend quickly enough - however, it also increases the power of your pitch and translate.Don't use the ""angle"" markers on the window as absolutes - they're probably going to be innaccurate if you're trying to figure out if you're level or not, because they depend on your head position. Instead, use the attitude gauge in the cockpit just to the right of the angle markers on the window: each grid on it is about 10 degrees. Finally, pitching forward will increase your ground speed and your rate of descent. Pitching backwards will decrease your ground speed and increase your rate of descent. Pitching so you're straight up and down will keep your forward speed steady and will give you the slowest descent. There's no vertical speed indicator to match the ground speed indicator, but the altitude indicator changes every second, so you can get a pretty good idea of how quickly you're descending. You can also look up videos of the Apollo descents on youtube to get a feel for their trajectory: how fast they were descending, what angle they were at, etc. Happy landings!"

It doesnt work as a VR game and is shallow as just an experience.Pros:+ its amazing to see the magnitude of this human accomplishment and gives a good feel of what was neccessary to achieve this+ the music is good and atmospheric+ original audio from the actual mission which was very interesting to listen toCons:- its super overpriced for just one hour and almost no interactivity- a lot of the textures are blurry and dont look good- the immersion is completely broken by the fact that you for the most part are an observer from the outside....like you are standing in space and watch the vessel fly.....I didnt like that at all and wanted more first person views to actually experience how it was like to go on this huge mission....its especially hilarious when you leave the moon and the game lets you stand outside the spacecraft to watch it fly off, leaving you on the moon....I felt like being stranded- there are only 2 interactive parts, where you can steer the spacecrafts and its horrible.....you have to be way too accurate for a VR experience and its just annoying. You also get a grade and I got an A- and still didnt pass.....luckily you can skip it once you are too frustrated- there is advertisment for Audi on the moon.....Im not even kidding here, if they got them as a sponsor, why do I have to buy this at this high price?- its like this wasnt meant to be for VR, often times the camera flies around something really fast like in a cinematic scene, but in VR this just makes you uncomfortable and dizzy- everything is so lifeless and stale, the other astronauts never interact with you, the flag on the moon does not move like it did in real life, breaking the immersion again, which VR is all aboutNot a good experience and super overpriced for 1 hour with no replayability whatsoever.

The sense of scale in VR really makes you understand the magnitude of the moon landing.I used the word experience with a purpose, because calling it a game would be misleading. All in all there are 3 parts where you can actively control what is going on, one of them the exploration of the moons surface. But most of the time you are spectating as a part of the Apollo 11 crew. In fact I recommend choosing the ""cinematic mode"" when starting the first time (see what i did there ;)), and using the interactive mode for further expeditions.And if you have any interest in the exploration of space you will come back, despite the sometimes sub-par graphics and animations. This is because, as mentioned above, the sheer magnitude of the events unfolding and the really great soundtrack create an uplifting experience (did it again) that is just astonishing.

After getting my Vive and experiencing room scale, I thought, ""There's no way I can enjoy a seated experience now."" After playing a bunch of VR experiences and hungry for more, I decided to give this a try. Thankfully I can say I don't regret the purchase. Before you start this, make sure you give yourself a good 90 minutes of uninterrupted time. You spend this experience going through the Apollo 11 launch, entering space, landing on the moon, and coming home.There's two versions of the experience: one where it's all an automated scene by scene experience and one that adds in interactive versions of a few scenes. I went with the interactive version because I felt it would be more gamey than sitting and looking. While the interactive scenes are really nice addition to the experience, I wouldn't recommend it for the first viewing. One of the scenes is having you land the lunar module on the moon and I got so frustrated failing that it took me out of the experience. You can thankfully skip to the regular scene if you want without having to start everything over. But I'd recommend playing the normal non-interactive version first so you stay in the moment.My GTX970 did have an issue during the moon landing sequence and got jittery, other than that the experience didn't hiccup. Motion sickness wise, my only issue was re-entering Earth because the whole module starts shaking like crazy. But even with those issues, I'd recommend Apollo 11 VR. I can see it not being for everyone but my jaw dropped when I reached space and walking on the moon was incredible. If you've ever wanted to be an astronaut or walk on the moon, you have to pick this up. If you're not really into historical pieces, you may want to avoid this. This experience aims to take you through being an astronaut on Apollo 11, not a joy ride through space. But if you don't mind an educational piece, this is worth a place in your VR collection."

I did really feel like I was in the command module on the launch pad. But the experience is marred by long load times between sections where you are placed into a grey space with nothing in it which immediately takes you out of the experience. I would suggest avoiding the interactive sections, they are not really that good best just to sit back and enjoy the ride for what it is. As an experience I would give it a 7 out of 10 which I would rate higher except for the long load times between events.

It's accuarte, provides a really good sense of the scale of everything (especially the size of the Saturn V), and is an enjoyable hour long experience.This game could use some better textures, more first-person experiences, and some room-scale moonwalking (though that may be disorienting). I would also have liked to be able to move around in the spaceships and get to interact with the controls more directly. As it was, I couldn't read all of the labels in the cockpit.Granted, a lot of these flaws are because this was developed more for the Oculus which doesn't have room scale but it would have been nice to take advantage of that."

Definitely going to give one this a revisit.(I opted for the Cinematic mode, over the Interactive mode, so I cannot give an opinion on how well the interactive mode was implemented.)Got it on sale for $5, which feels like a decent price for what it is. While I'm used to other experiences of this quality and length being free, I don't necessarily mind encouraging development!Ran without a hitch on the Oculus Rift, using a 360 pad."

It takes VR to a new level when you can stand next to Neil Armstrong and watch him land the lunar module on the surface of the moon with all the controls and view from the time.

Over all not up too the hype and not realy worth the cash.Best part is landing on the moon.  Worst part is all the parts it skips.Would be better if it gave you more options to look around the different parts of the ship and if you could pick your camera locations.I would only recomend this too those who are deeply into the Apollo program.  If you are just curious go watch Apollo 13 the movie."

They have clearly put some work into this. Though in saying that, it this had much for features then I would have gladly paid a lot more. The only frustrating part was the instructions for interactive sections were very poor. But the intergration of NASA archives was great :)It's worth the experience, and I would love to see someone do something similar with more depth to it. Such as interaction from other characters.Thank you to the developers for making this :)"
