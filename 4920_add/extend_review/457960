A few shouts of ""I'm mufukin Legolas' later and I'm breathing hard, sweating and thoroughly entertained. Scores of enemies lay shattered at my feet. Arrows embedded in the walls, the ceiling and floor.My wife thought I looked dumb shooting invisible arrows straight up at the ceiling while kneeling and swearing. I didn't. I felt like I looked awesome. You will be ducking, kneeling, spinning, nocking, shooting, nocking, shooting until you fall over.Oh ya  I did get the headset chord caught around my foot so watch out for that. Also there was bullet time when bullets and things get a little too close to your face (which is awesome)This game, it's awesome."

I liked the act of firing a bow so much that I thought I'd search for more expansive bow and arrow experience. Thats where I came across Holopoint. The mechanics of the game are quite simple, but so enjoyable. Each time I hit a target, it fires back at me, causing me to have to dodge out of the way. This is what makes the action feel so cool. Each shot I take, I immediately move/lean/crouch out of the way and into position for another shot. When you begin to string together shots and position changes, its an incredible and oddly fluid/graceful feeling.For the price, Holopoint is a pretty fun experience. I experienced no motion sickness, no tracking issues, and had no trouble enjoying the experience. Its a very active game, so prepare to sweat. If you're a fan of the bow and arrow mechanic, I definitely recommend."

The whole mechanic is based around firing arrows at boxes while dodging shots fired at you, with every level becoming more challenging. More boxes. More shots fired at you. Closer boxes. Different enemies. Boss levels! It doesn't seem like there's much to the game play...but that's all you need for an intense 15-30 minute game.-It is a work out. My thighs are killing me, my arms are tired, my core has been worked. I told a friend I felt like I was doing standing up sit ups. My waste has been bent forward and backward more times than I care to count in a ten minute game span.-Videos do not do this game justice. Not...one...bit. If there was a game that needed a demo, it's this one. I almost quit in the first five mintues because I didn't even think the game was polished enough to justify keep playing. I'm glad I didn't quit.-The samurai that attack you.                  They look real. Watch out for them."

You shoot with arrows on blue boxes that unfortunately shoot back which requires you to step aside or move your head aside in order not to get shot. Later you will fight again holographic moving enemies.It is very difficult and to be honest in the beginning discouraging. Just try at bit more often. Do not fell the temptation to immediately refund the game.Make sure to play in the morning or at least when you feel yourself fit enough. It is not the sunday hang-over game or the after-work tired lazy gaming experience.Bringing PC gaming and sports together. That's what it is.Highly recommended for the fitter gamers out there or those that want to be fit again after year of lazy seated gaming. Like me. hahah...
76561198045246321,Recommended,457960,32926093,Posted: 28 June,all,GanjaNight,"Holopoint is a fast archery combat game which demands a lot physical movement, precision and quick re-orientation work of its players. Playing this right causes solid sweating after few minutes. The learning curve is quiet good and the fun playing it is going to increase with it.Persanally this is one of my favorite VR games now. It has not much content but the thing it does are mostly right. It has high replay value if you see it like me as a game for workout.The most impressiv thing which did this game for me was to break my „gamepad-lethargy“, how i call it now. Decades of playing just with keyboard & mouse or with a gamepad teached me to press a button or stick to move around and avoid to be hit by bullets. In VR games my reaction time was sooo sloooow and in many situation i just stood dump around and got hit and was frustrated. I could have moved a step right or left but somehow it didnt work. And then in Holopoint there was the moment then I jumped, yes JUMPED, to avoid a projectile. And now I constantly move around - using the little room I have in VR to it‘s full extend – to get the best angle to shoot or get to the savest spot in the room. I crouch, twist or bend my body to avoid projectiles.  No other VR game demand this much movement from its players than Holopoint. The constant necessary flow of movement, re-orientation, aiming and shooting is exhilarating and chilling in the same time.Sure there are a few downsides in this game. Biggest is the poor bow mechanic compared with games like QuiVR. In QuiVR shooting with the bow fast feels natural and it is possible to headshot enemies over large distances. Using the bow in Holopoint feels awkward in the first place but gets better after a short time. My advice for people who come from QuiVR: look in the option menu and try around different settings, this helped me to get better results. The main reason for the awkward feeling is that the grip is too much below the center of the bow. It feels like you dont hold the grip but the bow arm below it. I dont know why the developer did this. They might had a reason and in time i got used to it. Now 95% shots are hits. There are also other things which could be adressed with little effort and would make the game even better. I hope the developer is going to put more work in this jewel to create a true tressure :)(Please excuse grammar failure and misspells. English is not my mother language.)"

The realisim of reaching behind you to pull an endless amount of arrows out of your quiver is enough to make you truly feel like Legolas or Katniss Everdeen.

I think depending on your room size and how good you are at cable management (you know what I mean) this could be improved with the addition of a few ""options"".If you could choose whether the ""bad guys"" hit back at all, that would change the pace, and allow you to enjoy the game a little more if you dont want that work out.A few other ideas could easily make it more enduring, like different shapes, enemies, etc.The theme of the room is very Matrix, and that could be exploited, plus perhaps a room change or two, maybe user selected.I like this game a lot, recommend it, but dont play it if I dont want to make the headband in my vive sweat, which is a shame as I would play it a lot more if I didnt HAVE to workout to play.Space pirate trainer seems to suffer the same with pacing I find. Easy for ages then suddenly stupidly difficult.

He seems to patch in two bugs for every bug he fixes, and recently has all but abandoned development for Holopoint (but not before doubling the price).The second half of the game is too difficult to reach and has broken aiming, but with total silence from the dev for three months we can probably assume he's cut and run."

Highly recommend it to anyone.The point of games like this is to trick me, the lazy geek, into exercise.  For that reason, the dodge mechanics become very important.Holopoint requires a fairly significant amount of dodging.  Part of what makes that possible is the single shots coming from bad guys that don't track your movement.  Something shoots, I see it, and move out of the way.  Eventually too many things shoot and I die, but the single shot mechanics ""work"" for me and keep me active. (currently ranked #530 or so... so I don't suck at the game... or there are only 540 people playing:) )Those jerks with the swords are pretty exciting too.  Nothing like turning around and having one of them inside my movement box because I forgot he was sneaking up on me until that point.My only con is the lack of instructions.  I've poked around and couldn't find anything specifically stating how to play.  Its not that difficult, but...Why does a box sometimes not shoot?  (bullseye hit vs not)Why do my arrows sometime start burning?  (No Clue.  Speed of shots?  # of hits in a second?  what?)Do burning arrows DO anything except look cool? (I don't THINK so)Can I dodge the sword swings? (I don't think so, but that would be cool if I could)Can I shoot ANY incoming missile (stars, crap from that one boss, etc?)Does putting my arrow in the way of an incoming missile actually count as an intercept? (seemed like that happened once)As an aside, I wish I could search for ""Room-sized"" ONLY games.  Things that don't have ""standing"" or ""seated"" as options."

Of all the games I purchased, Holopoint is probably the top for getting my heartrate up.  The first levels are very easy, just introducing you to the game.  Once you hit level 25 though (you can start a play session at any level you have reached in increments of 5) the game is surprisingly fast paced and tiring.When things get intense, I find myself crouched on the ground firing arrows and spinning on my heels like Legolas in LOTR movies.  The game is definitely better with a large play space and I highly encourage some kind of ceiling cable management system to keep the cords from getting tangled around your feet.

Other archer games just have you sitting on a platform shooting things below you. Holopoint has you on the ground and in the action.  Most targets you shoot will attempt to shoot back, forcing you to move out of the way while keeping your eye out for more targets. There are bossfights if you can progress far enough and recently they have been adding raids that  include new enemy types, a new boss and a unique bow. At its core it is still a wave shooter but the dodging mechanics are more than enough to keep you entertained and feeling like a badass archer."

The way you can walk around in your playarea, looking for the appearing enemies, the way you have to get a new arrow by reaching behind your head. You really feel immersed in the game!The blue boxes seem a little bit like a placeholder, but to be honest I never thought about that during the gameplay.Because you need to dodge the shots, it's also a nice little workput ;)If you want to showcase VR a little bit, this is a perfect game. Just drop the people in at level 5 and watch them reach level 10 ;) Or experience the feeling, if you spot an enemy behind your back und you can just turn halfway round and fire there...amazing.Pros:- perfect use of rommscale VR and the vive controllers- nice little workout- engaging highscore systemCon:- additional weapons would be nice- change placeholder graphics for the boxesBe the archer Green Arrow couldn't be this season!"

Seems simple untill they start shooting back. The idea is that you have eyes in the back of yor head so you can both eliminate cubes for points and avoid cubes shooting at you. When a cube dies it more often than not shoots you, when a cube turns orange it shoots you. How do you avoud these shots? You dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge your way around them. Also there is samurai and ninjas.Is Holopoint good?Holopoint has amassed an impressive 97% positive feedback and with good reason, it is simple but fun. You need no archery skill and it works well even in a relatively small space and for a measly £5 pricetag it is tempting to say no to.For how cheap the game is and for how much fun and exercise you and some friends can get I think that Holopoint is very much worth itIs anything bad?If i'm nitpicking then i'd say that there is no real tutorial and that it was frustrating realising that physical movement is required to progress in this game (which is a lot to ask from a nerd), only other points are perhaps the lack of bow options or any kind of features that would make the game more complex.

You're going so fast your arrows have literally lit on fire. You're hot and sweating, you're almost to the end of the wave. And then, as you pivot to take out a humming square that's about to shoot, your Vive's power connector yanks out of the box because you've been spinning around so much that the tether is all twisted. You lost.That was my biggest enemy in this game, stepping on the cord, getting the cord tangled, unplugging the cord because all the slack was taken up by twists. Even my earbuds managed to get caught and pull out of my ears once. The game is fantastic, it's one of my favorite experiences so far. But it really shows off the limitations of the Vive's cabling. Maybe it's just me, maybe other people have a pulley or something to keep things organized.But in the first twenty minutes of any session, when there's slack in the cord and you're not sweaty, it's a ludicrously fun game. A few other games have ""dodge"" mechanics like this, but those other games make your hitbox so large that you can't dodge all that well (they have block mechanics too, usually). This one has no block, you can only dodge; and the dodging is very precise - you only need to move your head half a foot to the left and a bullet will miss you.

The bow handling feels terrible compared to games like QuiVR and of course The Lab's Longbow.Even when using the ""two-handed"" setting (and why isn't that the default?) it still feels awful. The motion is delayed and the endpoints don't align with the controllers properly.The haptic feedback is all wrong, too. Again look at Longbow because how they do it makes sense. There should be vibration when you're pulling / slacking the string, but when you're holding it steady there shouldn't be vibration, obviously. This is another small thing that contributes to how ""off"" the whole handling feels.Other than that, I like the shoot / dodge concept.The humanoid enemies drop from the first floor in a very clunky animation.The game just isn't polished, from the basic handling, to the menus, etc etc."

,Recommended,457960,30989222,Posted: 6 April,all,Isaac_HoZ,"For a more in-depth look (and some high level gameplay) check out my video review:https://youtu.be/bRgVU7zyuXEHolopoint is like if SuperHot had sex with Space Pirate Simulator and Geometry Wars is in the closet watching… but there is no slow motion and you can only use a bow and arrow. Is that helpful? I think that describes this game pretty well after playing it for 50+ hours. At its heart it’s another wave based survival game that strongly prioritizes your own reactive movements above all else. Yes, it’s important to be accurate but you can miss an arrow here and there without the game ending. You yourself can only take two hits until it’s Game Over, so getting the Hell out of the way is a bit more important than landing your shots. That being said, I’d try to make every arrow count anyway as that’s pretty key for your hitting a new high score.Chasing after your high score is very addictive as no matter how low your score starts there is just something about knowing you’re a faster and a better virtual bowman than the dude you just toppled on the leaderboard. There is a downside: good luck not tangling your Vive’s cable. No, seriously, good luck. You’re going to need it. Based on how often enemies attack you from behind it would be a damn miracle for your not to have a horrifically tangled mess by the time you’re done with an intense play session.Still, even with that negative, I’d urge you to buy Holopoint if any of this sounds vaguely interesting. It may not be the best bow and arrow simulator on the Vive (though I intend to find out what is) but it sure does make you feel like a badass… perhaps more than any other game before it. I’d just probably do some stretches or something beforehand though, you don’t want to pull a hammy."

,Recommended,457960,31438109,Posted: 29 April,all,balthazar,"A year and a bit on this is still one of my favourite VR games. The mechanics are simple; shoot a box and it explodes and shoots a projectile back at you, which you have to dodge (in later levels, samurai also steadily approach you and you have to shoot them before they get to you). Simple though they may be, they're tuned perfectly. You're always focusing on the next target, balancing the time to line up a shot with the urgency of the two boxes behind you that you can hear are getting ready to explode (boxes left un-shot will explode and shoot at you of their own volition: still dodge-able but much harder and less predictable).The sound design is also excellent. As boxes near their exploding point, they make an unintrusive whooshing sound that builds to a crescendo. This is both long enough and balanced enough that you know exactly how long you have. It's also very well placed in the space around you, so you know what direction it's in. Excellent soundtrack as well.The game is very physical. It is the only VR game I've come across that actually builds up a sweat. By some accounts the game can be cheesed a bit if you're methodical with dodges, but it's equivalent to using a dictionary in scrabble; it may give better results, but it's no fun. It's best played leaping and spinning around like a ninja. Treat it that way and it will entirely fulfil your Matrix fantasies.I always see it reccommended for new users but rarely evangalised, which I think is a crying shame. I think it's one of the most mechanically complete games available for VR.10/10 would arrow-ninja again.N.B. There's two different aiming mechanics. I highly reccommend switching it to 'two-handed', as this aims like a real bow (straight line from rear hand to front hand). The default mode uses the orientation of your front hand to aim and doesn't feel natural; your hand won't be where the string is. Any negative comparisons to archery in The Lab etc have probably not enabled this, as it makes the aiming systems identical. Wish it was the default though."

A setting to only have targets appear in one direction, rather than in a 270* arch. Even settings for the size of the target, requiring more precise aim to hit them, stuff like that.For now, it's an extremely basic experience for the price, where you literally can only press start and be thrown into a very stressful experience where you are worn out after 3-4 attempts.So with some more options and variety, it'll be great but right now, it's just too limited and gets boring too easily.However, I won't give it a thumbs down due to the price. It's staying well below the current price-average of most VR games and there's enough fun in the game for the given price. But it could be so much more!"

Shooting the bow can feel quite good, and it's nice to notice you get better. But it still feels quite unfished.The game consistently crashes every time I exit, meaning you can't truly quit the game without taking off your headset to click on the ""this game has crashed"" windowThe intro logo keeps flying to the front of your face while the game loads, like a wayward hair that you can't quite grab. A bit of a pet peeve, but annoying anyway.The game's content is heavily gated, and it's very hard to see any new content. You only unlock new checkpoints every 5 levels, and those 5th levels often feel very unfair, suddenly introducing new mechanics, that you can't practice again without replaying all the ones before that. I understand that in martial arts repetition is everything, but let me decide on that myself in stead of forcing it. I'm trying to just have fun.The moving enemies don't obey the laws of physics. They will often change direction in an instant, going against a lifetime of training with things obeying momentum. This feels especially unfair when they follow it up with an attack that can kill you in an instant."

,Recommended,457960,23891710,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Krotiuz,"TLDR; Game is awesome fun and very physical. 100% immersion, bow position in left hand could be a little better, but is good enough. I recommend purchasing it, $15USD isn't too much for such a neat experience.Bought this game yesterday, and I've only played it about 45 minutes so far. This number *WILL* increase.Firstly this game is rather awesome. I've played maybe 15 VR games, and this one is the first to make me squeal like a little girl. The archery is almost spot on (more on that later), the waves of enemies build up nicely, and there's more variety in oppoents than Space Pirate Trainer for example.The Enemies: First off you start with some harmless looking cubes, which shoot things at you. These aren't too bad, and if you just dodge they seem to go away even if you miss. Then all of the sudden there's so many cubes, all you can think of is ""F*** I hope there's not one behind me!!"" Things calm down for a second when the next enemies are introduced, a swordsman. He doesn't shoot thigns at you and just comes at you with a raised sword. Relentlessly. And before you know it you've now gotta pay attention to where the sword guys are while the cubes fire more missiles at you. It's pandemonium. There are more enemies, and at least one boss, but I'll let you find them.Movement: Takes advantage of roomscale. Enough said really, although I have a roughly 2x2.5m space and I wouldnt want to be playing in any smaller, because have I mentioned that you move. Like a lot, jumping, dodging, weaving (falling over...)  I'd having a guess that this is probabaly the most active game on VR currently, and defintely the most active I've played.Combat: The archery is good, one handed mode is sort of like The Lab, and two handed mode is more how real life is like. Sadly, I wasn't fully happy with the way the controller was mapped to the bow, it feels like you're holding it too low. About 5-10cm (2-4"" for you Americans) too low. You can adjust to this, but I just feel that the archery would be perfect if it was changed a little. Devs, maybe an option to change the grip height on the bow?Overall, this is an awesome game. I love it. If you like the archery in The Lab and games like Space Pirate Trainer, I recommend picking it up.Performance: On my system this game works really well, and is fairly easy on hardware. My GPU's don't run VR terribly well, but at no point did I experience any desire for more framerate. Note: I haven't tried in single GPU mode, but in every other VR game that I've had performance issues with, one card is better than two.i5 2500k @ 4.6GHz16GB DDR3 RAM @ 1333MHzAMD 7970 GHz edition x2 (Crossfire)"

There are so many nuances to being a skilled archer, some of which includes leading your targets, accounting for arrow trajectory, and tracking moving objects, but this game has none of that.  You will spend your entire time in a small room firing at stationary targets.  Even the samurais walk directly toward you, so none of the above really comes into play.  This game does not take advantage of any of the mechanics that make archery so cool.The archery module included with the free game ""The Lab"" is a much better archery experience, Come to think of it, I even had more fun with the Wii Sports Resort archery, which included distant and moving targets along with crosswind and bonus objectives.The one thing I did enjoy about this game was the need to move your body to dodge incoming projectiles.

I enjoy that it gets me moving, but there are a number of issues with it that keep me from playing more.First, the mechanics for the bow lack a lot of feedback for the player. When knocking an arrow or drawing the bow there is no feedback from the controllers. This small omission really makes it difficult to know when you've got an arrow knocked and how powerful your shot will be once drawn.The hitbox for the quiver is a bit small as well. More than once I've reached for an arrow only to come up empty.The ""enemies"" are just a series of spinning cubes that fire at you when you hit them or if they have been left alone too long. They can spawn anywhere around you but do so without a sound or any other noticable cue for the player. This forces the player to spin around, looking for potential threats. As a result, the player is constantly at odds with the headset cables. I've almost tripped over them more than once and could have seriously damaged the hardware.It seems like the developers had a really interesting idea but just got as far as making it playable. Were they to polish it up a bit more and really think about the requirements of the platform and the needs of the player, Holopoint could be a much more enjoyable experience. As it stands now, I'd stick to the Lab's longbow."

Let me explain.Normally these actions would not be a big deal. The problem stems from the pace of the game...which is super fast paced and with dodging.First: when you go to pull an arrow from the quiver (on your back) the vive controller tends to clip my headphones (I use over the ear can style 7.1 surround sound...NOT CHEAP headphones!), and since the pace is so fast...I tend to hit them pretty hard violently knocking them from my head. I am worried I will break my vive controler and/or a $200 set of headphones.Second: The enemies shoot back when you hitt hem with an arrow. They do this so quickly that you havbe to move your head VERY fast to dodge the return shot. If you wear large can style headphones like I do, this allmost throws them across the room. Not cool.$8 game vs $200 headset or $1000 VR rig....you decide.TL;DR This game needs to chill a bit out with the action or you will break your headset/VR equipment.

Way moreso than any other game, I frequently find myself getting tangled up in the cables while playing. This is because most of the targets are placed to your sides and often times they are even behind you, so you have to constantly spin around to find a shot and then need to move forward and backwards to dodge. Compare this to something like Space Pirate Trainer where most of the time you fight enemies in front of you and can spend most of your time dodging left to right. Also, There isnt very much in the way of audio queues to tell you where to look, so you constantly need to whip your head around which frequently causes the headset or headphones to shift around. Lastly, the operation of the bow causes me to constatly smack my controllers or headset into eachother, and my efforts to avoid this cause me to misdraw.That said, I only find all of this stuff so frustrating because it gets in the way of my enjoyment of this otherwise fantastic game.

If you are looking for reasons to buy this game, look at the other positive reviews; I'm just going to focus on the negatives.First, waves 1-10 can be tedious. I don't know if you can skip them at the begining since I've gotten far past them since, but if you happen to lose on, say, wave 9, you have to back track and redo some of the tedium. It can get frustrating fighting the same 'responsive' cube over and over again.  It'd be better if there was something else to hook the player's attention in these first few waves.Second, the point system in this game is hard to decipher. Its there, and there are leaderboards, but the best way to get points is a mystery. All it really needs to fix this issue is to have some sort of score pop-up after you destroy an enemy.My negatives are small though, and this game is definitely fun if your looking for an dedicated archery game outside of the Lab's archery."

It's still a great experience and well worth the price; you just have to be real careful with the cord.As a final note, I noticed a few other reviewers complaining about the bow and arrow dynamics (saying they weren't as good as in The Lab), which almost made me not buy this game. Not sure if the game has been updated since those reviews or if those people just didn't know what to expect, but as someone who's shot a lot of real bows, I can tell you the dynamics are perfect. They're also adjustable in the settings if you don't like them for whatever reason."

You are forced to take a step sideways after every shot, so it gets your feet shuffling at the start and has you dodging bullets like Neo near the end.If you've wanted to feel like Legolas or the archer girl in Hunger Games (sorry HG fans) then this is the training you need.

Have had some small issues with slowdowns and lost tracking, but only like 1% of the time in one out of five games. 9/10 highly recommended.The gameplay is simple, you stand in a room and shoot stuff at the same time as dodging projectiles that are spawned from the things you shoot (or thrown, or spawned if you're to slow at shooting something). I recommend the setting that lets you control the bow with both hands, feels more realistic and is a better workout. Try really getting into it and pretend it's a real bow, bend your legs and you'll feel like a Samurai :)It's pretty easy to tangle the cord to your HMD after spinning around alot, a tip is to try and return to a ""base position"" facing the same direction after every move, sort of like when playing tennis or squash."

This game has gone straight to the top of my list of Vive launch titles. The difficulty ramp is perfect so far (just hit wave 16, I think) - changing things up just enough as time goes by to keep you pressured (and to get you moving enough to get your heart rate up!), without feeling unfair. I expect that I have a long ways to go before I'm good enough to see all this game has to offer, but I don't plan on stopping any time soon.I will admit that I'm not sure how this game would play in a tight space - I have about 2.5x2.5 meters and feel like I use it all, but you could probably get away with less with more ducking.The only problem I have had with the game is one built-in to the Vive - I recently died because I stepped on my cable and lost USB connection to the computer from the linkbox.

I literally feel like a 日本の射手 (nihon no ite -> japanese archer) practicing 弓道 (kyudo -> ""way of the bow"") in my own personal dojo.  My only complaints are that the samurai become invulnerable once they begin their attack animation, and their attack is a high swipe so it looks like it should be dodge-able.  The only bug I've experienced is occasionally my arrow will shoot horizontally and do no damage (maybe I'm pulling too sloppy?), and occasionally the start cube doesn't activate when firing on it.This game is very similar to Space Pirate Trainer, except there's more diversity in enemy types at the expense of less diversity in attack options.

Sounds boring right? Not as simple as it sounds. The moment you hit one, it retaliates and shoots back as they shatter. And if you leave them around for too long... they also shoot. This goes on with every increasing amounts and eventually you simply cannot hit them all before one shoots without you hitting it first... and thats when things change radically and new types of enemies start relentlessly be thrown, a suprise after another. And no, there are no shields, so no turtleing, and you have to dodge all the projectiles.Thats when things get really interesting and accuracy becomes very important.And its not just Point and shoot, you have to use both your hands to align your shots at your target, and coordinate with the other to reach the quever. You will feel even more bad *** when you manage to hit multiple targets in a row.I highly recommend this to anyone that the space to go side to side in, and has the physical fitness to play it: but do pull off some practise on turning with the head set on. There is a danger of getting tangled with the headset if one keeps turning a single direction.

So, so much this.I loved trying out theBlu and getting a first sense for the whole VR thing. And then trying out The Lab and seeing how interacting with VR worlds could seem natural and just... real. But they both felt like the type of thing that would be more useful for ""Hey, you have to check *this* out"" when friends come over, rather than any sort of lasting experience.And then there's this little $8 game. Even though it requires a high-end PC and an $800 headset thingie, it somehow reminds me of some of the very first video games, in a very very good way. It's just pure gameplay. There's no gimmicks, no plot, no nothing, just you and a high score list, but the gameplay is so damn *fun* that that's all you care about.As (many) other reviews on the interwebs say, yes, it does in fact make you feel like a badass. When you duck underneath a cyber-samurai's sword swing while drawing back your bow to take out another one off to the side, yeah, you feel ridiculously cool. And that's because Holopoint just strips away everything and somehow makes you feel you're *there*. It is so viscerally satisfying.A couple of things that could impact your Vive's livelihood. First, after playing this for 15-20 minutes, I started to sweat a bit. Which hasn't come close to happening with any other VR thing I've played. Maybe a little bit with the (similarly simple but beautiful) Space Pirate Trainer, but not to this degree. So you might get some damp (and eventually stinky) Vive foam.Second, as a few other reviews point out, you move around a *lot* in this game. I've yanked the Vive's cable from its little dock with my feet three times now. And I've pulled out my earplugs an equal number of times. It's frantic, and you pivot around constantly. Plus, ducking and weaving and dodging out of the way. I did find that after playing for an hour or so, my brain started to somehow process where I was in the real world while paying attention in the virtual world, and things got a little better. I found myself raising my feet, anticipating where the cord would be. Or turning counter-clockwise after turning clockwise a few times to untangle the cord. And I also found myself relaxing a bit and being less spazzy overall after playing for a while, which also helps.I kind of expected that VR games would give me the whoas, and be really cool things to show off to friends. I had no idea that some $8 launch title would also fall into that rare category of game where if I have 10 free minutes I'll go fire it up, thinking ""OK, time for just one round..."" This game does that."

Easy to forget that you're not actually some hot-shot archer training for battle. Overall the best game for cardio I have found for the Vive, providing a good amount of sweat and fun.Cons: Cord is easy to trip over when you're spinning around every few seconds, and the bow mechanics are a bit unrealistic with your arrow-hand not affecting trajectory. But, it's a game and that can be overlooked."

Nice break from the gun-based variety. It starts out simple (what? I'm just shooting cubes?) but builds to very satisfying levels.As a bonus, I credit Holopoint for honing my sense of where my headset cable is at all times.If the developer would add more scenes, enemies, waves, etc., I'd be very happy. That said, it's still a fine value as it is."

BOY AM I GLAD I DID!There's not a lot to it, but what it does have is super fun. It is the most active Vive game I've played so far, and I get out of breath on every round. I guess this is how athletes stay in good shape...they get a workout doing something active that they love! There will be a lot of nerds losing weight with this title. :)"

,Recommended,457960,24733650,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,benji7425,"Definitely my favourite VR game yet! At the time of this review, Steam says I have a bit over an hour in the game, which seems weird to me because I definietly feel like its been at least twice that.Anyway, this is very fun! It becomes a lot more than just point and shoot, as the floaty squares shoot projectiles at you when you destroy them, and explode if you leave them for long enough without destroying them. You end up shooting and dodging, and constantly turning to check behind and above you for newly spawned floaty cubes (not really sure what to call them!)Every 5 waves you reach a sort of ""checkpoint"", ie when you die you can restart at that level - but only if you have reached that level at least once before.Once you reach wave 10 the dudes start to spawn. At first they seem less dangerous than the floaty cubes, as they move slowly and dont shoot at you, but I found them harder to hit, and if they reach you it is actually quite terrifying when they swing their sword in your face! It really gives motivation to improve your aim and shoot them before they get too close.This game is not yet perfect - my main complaint would be that the default aim is too low. It takes quite a bit of getting used to - I feel like I need to move my bowstring hand further down than I should just to get the arrow to fire straight and perpendicular to my body. As with almost all VR games at this point, it does feel like it could use a bit more work, but is still incredibly fun as it is at the moment.The constant doding, moving and shooting can get quite tiring. Whilst not especially fit, I'm in OK shape, and I find this game gets me fairly sweaty after playing for a while. I normally need to go take a shower straight after playing! I'm hoping this will help me get a bit fitter though, as it definitely feels like a mini-workout playing this.All in all a very fun game, and I definitely recommend you purchase it - unless, that is, you have the minimum amount of space to play in.This game requires you move around a bit, and initially I only had the minimum area to play in with my Vive, and I feared for my controllers with the amount I was smashing them into things (thankfully they are still fine).Once I managed to upgrade my space into a larger area it becamse a lot easier to play the game.You can still try play it in a tiny space, but its really hard and not too fun, so you might need to give this a miss if you are playing in a tiny space."

But the feeling of shooting arrows while dodging lazer beams and just being a freaking BADASS is just perfection. 5 stars for Holopoint. Have a Vive? Get it. Have an Oculus? Get it, but make sure that you have at least three sensors for the best experience. Have Playstation VR? What the hell are you doing here? Anyway, this game is a must have."
