,Not Recommended,458060,22589186,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,Thehagengnome,"This is a short visual novel that focuses on the life of an emperor and his sister. So what's good about this game, and what's not. Well..Pros:- a little art of slightly undressed women, i guess..Cons:- Horrible soundtrack, repeats every god damn minute- Uninspired writing, with grammar mistakes and dull language- Subpar art at best- Writing that tells a rubbish story without more or less any substance or reason- Throwing in lines about killing people for fun + lesbian and incest things without explaining why, and without it adding anything to the story. Just having it there for the lol's i guessThat's more or less what this game is, i would not reccomend buying it. Not even at this price, simply because you would be wasting your time. And as a final note, you can change three sound settings in the options menu. You can change music, speech and ""effects"". Yet, the only sound in-game is a really annoying soundtrack... Wonder where the other sound elements are, maybe they are in the next game.. If you want to look at it some more, you can check out my youtube video of it below.Gameplay video:https://youtu.be/FkADB9gC1Rk"

Well, it's a VN that supposedly ""follows up"" the story from the game I Am Caligula. It definitely follows in I Am Caligula's footsteps in terms of absolutely awful writing, grammar, and spelling. The story reads a lot more like a poor fanfic (or, in this case, ""real person fiction"" would be the accurate term). You have the original character Lucca who is apparently the favourite slave of Drusilla.I cannot suggest Drusilla Dreams at all, and I highly suggest you run far, far away from it. There are FAR better VNs out there that cost less than this (and this already does not cost very much). If you want to find out more about the real Drusilla and Caligula, go to wikipedia and don't support this game. Also be warned that there is a fair bit of sex talk in the short amount of time this VN will take. It's something that makes me question why this game doesn't have some sort of age gate on it, but what do I know in terms of that I suppose."

I took the liberty of wasting $0.64 just to see how garbage this mess really was. AND BOY IS IT GARBAGE!PROS:If you're into incest and lesbianism, then this is for you.If you have poor eyesight, then the art style can be actually quite refreshing and worth noting for it's ""intricate"" design.If you like your games less than an hour long, and about the rate of completion on par, if not surpassing 'Gone Home', then is a worthy investment.Buy this game if lighting dollars on fire is a natural pass-time for you.It hasmultiple endings.CONS:As soon as you start up the game, you're greeted with a screen devoid of any audio.The UI, if you can call it that, looks like vomited feces that has pieces of corn in it of varying widths.Speaking of audio. I've not once heard any voiceovers, and the background music gets grating after the second loop... Which loops pretty often if you're a slow reader like I am. Fortunately, it has more than one track.It's riddled with spelling errors, and poor punctuation, you'd almost think this was made by a bunch of Weeaboos with a love for history*COUGH*. Excuse me, I have an allergic reaction to my own irony.The ability to make decisions happens once in a while, and dictate when and how your ending will play off. If you think that's normal, you'd be right... Except if you spacebar'd through the monotonous text, then decisions mean nothing since the game ends as quickly as it began.I'm not very good at history or linguistics, but I'm pretty sure Romans didn't talk like these people. I'm not even refering to the fact that English probably wasn't their primary language.Remember those endings I mentioned earlier? Yeah, there's probably like 4-8 (I only encountered 3 of my own) endings, and each one is just a history lesson about thetwoprotagonists. I'm referring to Caligula, and Drussila. Oops... SPOILERS! Like it matters...Speaking of Caligula. He's in this game for some reason, which contradicts the whole point of Drussila ""overthrowing him"", considering that in one of the history lessons that preceeds one of the endings, it mentions he passed the throne to Drussila after falling ill. Hmm....The text box sucks. It's far bigger than it needs to be 90% of the game, and when text does fill the window entirely, it's welcomed by its co-pilots, BAD GRAMMAR & PPFT-WHO-NEEDS-WORD-WRAP.Remember how I said the art style is great for those with poor eyesight? Now, if you can accurately see your screen, and actually have artistic taste, then you'll probably agree the characters and the accompanying background look atrocious. I mean, most DeviantArtist's would likely agree that it looks ""nice"", but this isn't DeviantArt.It kicks actual Visual Novels in the balls for being better at being a VN than this monstrosity. By that, I mean it isn't a Visual Novel-- Because it's not the length of a novel... Not even a Light Novel.There's controller config in the options......... Why?Final Thoughts:If I can get my money back, I likely will proceed in doing so. Even if it's a measly $0.64. That 64 cents was spent to prove a point. The point has been made, and I'd rather go back and play Zombie National Park before I play another ""game"" by this company again. Here's a small album of a few screenshots I took showcasing some of the ""excitement"":http://imgur.com/a/PFbZX1/10 - Never again."

I got that $1 back.Pros:+ Works+ Art is ok I guessCons:- Horrible writing- Tons of spelling and grammar mistakes- I beat it in 8 minutes (Yes I read everything)- Little music- The developers can't handle criticism, banned me from the steam forums for criticising the gameSo just... don't.I edited the review to make it longer and more in-depth, here's the original:You can beat this game in 8 minutes. Not worth the $1. Also the devs banned me from the forums for criticising the game."

And unless it turns out I was missing something here I strongly suspect it'll also be my last.Maybe my expectations were too high.  I figured this would probably be some sort of Roman history fan fiction, but in less than 20 minutes I think I explored ALL of the possibilities and got all of the endings (4 or 5 I think).  Choices really didnt matter - this seriously lacks any sort of depth.  Ends after 2-3 ""choices""...why does this even have a ""save"" option???"

Instead of addressing problems people who reviewed the game mentioned, he fixed one issue, and then used the characters to talk to the reviewers by saying ""the creator told the reviewers to eat♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; now, you might be asking why did they say this. Well they said this because the creator was tired of people complaining about his terrible game, and instead of fixing what's wrong with the game he told the people who payed for his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game to eat♥♥♥♥♥♥Tl;dr. This game is a 30 minute long ♥♥♥♥♥how with a terrible game creator. DO NOT buy"

Even if it was free would still feel like a rip-off. That's how horribly bad this game is. No character development, dull dialogue and short story. The very few whom gave this abomination of a game a thumbs up need to have their head examined."

,Not Recommended,458060,34388486,Posted: 20 August,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Adventure - VN - Visual NovelAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Inconsistent polish. Meh character development, internal coherence and historical believability. Low amount of content. Interactivity limited to very few choices mostly in the intro and at the end to supply the ending.Noticed some typos and this borrows too much from real history which might at first confuse the player as they slowly are faced with the fan fiction grade plot layers. Game art was actually okay-ish for what it was, and the writing was at least well structured and had a certain elegance about the storytelling aspect of it. I found the wish fullfillment to be both a little on the blatant and unsettling side of things, especially given the nature of the relationships between everyone and their supposed status as powerful entities of their time. It just does not gel. In the end this is just too short and has too many issues to actually warrant keeping on active library and I will move it to declutter."

,Recommended,458060,28660132,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,undeadbobop♫Faint♫,"Flagship rants in these reviews, but honestly it is just simply a story book with 5 different endings. Most of the art work shown in screen shots on the steam page shows the endings to try to get people to buy it leading them into sexual idealisms from the start making them think sex will be in the game when it won't. Google search porn if that is what you want. As for the story telling I found some misspellings, some lack of continuity with characters that would lack it, and a few 4th wall breakings that are entirely unnessary as nothing more than filler, and a lack of ablity to tell a story but rather present a joke.Now Why am I recormending this game? Well I am a masochist, I knew this game was garbage, because it is simply not a game really. I attempted to make something similar with IE and VBS YEEEARS ago and it had more options to choices and more endings and it was only 1/100th of the way done.This game has many useless features not even used in the game which tells me it is left over content from what ever template, engine, or framework they used to make it. Such as a save feature. It is entirely useless outside of saving at decission making points to skip text blobs.FYI the story is entire BS incest, talking horses, and getting in sexual positionings for nothing more than steam screenshots to try to get people to buy this, there is no gameplay out side of clicking 2 choice options.This ""Game"" is trading card father for the grinder. Oh wait... It isn't even that.FYI this game is the sequal to ""I am Caligula"" another ""novel"" written by a typical internet troll out for yee money.It is just as bad and for even lesser reasons costs more.This game doesn't even know what it is trying to be other than a income grinder for the 1 dev team."

76561198069159152,Recommended,458060,31552736,Posted: 4 May,all,wrb41977,"This is a very, very short visual novel. There are five endings, most of which aren't that great. Julia Drusilla, sister of Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, better known as Caligula. While the game builds on rumors that she and her brother were lovers, there is really no historical evidence of such (in fact, most of the rumors were made up later to discredit Caligula). What is true, is that upon her death in 38 AD, Caligula had her deified (something which probably lead to some of the rumors of her being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Also true is when Caligula fell ill in 37 AD, he named her as his heir (to continue the line of Julius Caesar, from whom both were descended). Side note: That illness may well have done some mental damage which lead to the later insanity from which he is said to have suffered.Okay, I have probably above given you more historical information than is in this entire game. No matter...The game itself is a bit of fluff. If you approach it as such, you might even enjoy it. If, on the other hand, you approach it for historical accuracy... go elsewhere."
