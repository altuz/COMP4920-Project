,Recommended,458470,23350811,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,shiaakuma,"I've gotten to the point where I snap up every Artifex Mundi title the minute it comes out, and I'm rarely disappointed.  This new game is probably one of my favorites thus far.The format is familiar to any veterans of the genre: minigames and hidden object scenes, inventory management, etc.  Where I feel it stands out is with some new features, especially an improved inventory that allows more interaction with objects, including combining and rotating objects.  Gone from this game is the mildly irritating ""I guess I'll leave this hook here for the next half an hour since I don't have the rope to attach to it yet"" situation; instead you're able to grab and combine as you go.  This cuts back on backtracking for earlier objects you couldn't use yet.Graphically, this game is very pretty, especially for the genre which isn't always known for good-quality visuals (although that's improving with time).  Hidden object scenes are clear and crisp with no pixel hunting necessary.Voice acting is done quite well in this game, which is a relief to me (and anyone like me who cringes at some of the godawful voicework out there).  I actually enjoyed listening to the dialogue for a change.The minigames are varied and not too difficult, but aren't total pushovers either.  There are also the usual little flourishes, like achievements and collectables that add some extra fun (and replayability) to the game if you're a completionist.Overall, a very good game with an interesting plot concept and well-crafted scenes and gameplay.  I clocked in at 3.5 hours for one playthrough, which is a good length for this type of game (even taking into account my stepping away from the PC for 20 minutes to make lunch).Absolutely 100% recommended for any fans of the genre.  I generally wait for these games on sale because I don't usually like the $10 price, but I enjoyed this one so much I think I would happily pay full price."

While at first glance, this genre seemed too casual for me, but boy I was wrong.I get it now.After my experience I can say two things:1. Yeah, this game is fairly 'casual', BUT2. Man-oh-man it is addicting and sooo butter smooth to playGrim Legends 3: The Dark Cityisverypolished, and definatley keeps you clicking.The time flies. The storyline is a cool fairy-tale esque affair, and the puzzles are just difficult enough to keep me interested - yet never make me rage. There is something very rewarding about going through this. While this genre will never be the staple of what I play, I definately appreciate it and think highly of how well-crafted it is.Essentially, this title is a series of closely related minigames that you solve as you experiece a great story.Some are run-of-the-mill hidden obect games, BUT alot of this reminds me of classic point-and-click adventuring (without a character physically moving around the screen). You have an inventory and use it to solve puzzles.Definately a great atmosphere.Pros:+Highly polished game with stunning atmosphere and engaging story+Very rewarding puzzle solving that is a bit addictive+Easy to get into+If you haven't tried one of these, you owe it to yourself to pick one up when there is a deep saleCons:-Definately a casual game, but great for just kicking back and enjoying the experienceGet one on sale, and I bet you will find yourself smiling and really enjoying it."
,Recommended,458470,23431076,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"Sylvia is a member of a secret order, guarding Incarcerati Stones and protecting the world from Koshmaar. However, she lost her memory one year ago. With Solomon, her master, she goes to Lichtenheim, where a thief is hiding with a stone. However, why Gabriel, a former member, would have used it? And why is Sylvia feeling that this is related to her?Grim Legends 3: The Dark City is as any Artifex Mundi developed game a true gem in terms of story. You don't know who you are really and the more you're learning about Gabriel and Solomon, the more you're feeling it's relating to you. Even the way to discover why the people possessed by the Koshmaar is interesting: memories of their involvements are told by solving different minigames, all pictures of their stories.In terms of gameplay, everything is simple: you take items, you use them, you combine them, you clear hidden objects scenes (whether it's a list of words or a silhouette-shaped mechanism), you solve puzzles. Nothing is really extraordinary there, apart the way to save people as explained above. I've a great regret: the prologue showed a very interesting way to play: formulate a plan by looking and clicking on items/persons of interests. It's the only time it's used. Contrary to 9 Clues or Enigmatis, which are using specific mechanisms several times, Grim Legends 3 is void of this. However, you'll have to defend yourself against the possessed people by using magic. To win, you need to find the only pair of symbols not represented on the enemy side.Graphics are really good, as usual. However, I feel like the team was influenced by Assassin's Creed, given how the girl is moving in the beginning and the clothes. It's a Grim Legend game, meaning that you have dark stuff in it. But where the first two games were still colorful, here, you're really in a grim city, with rain, darkness, anything that can make feel like you're in a nightmare.As usual, the soundtrack is marvelous. The tunes are really fitting the game.But there is something unusual for Artifex Mundi, more if it's a game of their own: translations were badly handled. While it's not as catastrophic as in Princess Isabella, it's like they fired or stopped using people to check translations. Thanks god, there isn't much hidden objects scenes with words but even there, you have real problems: since when a coat of arms, which is translated in French by ""blason"", is a ""bras"", which is an arm? I was searching for the part of the body, not for a coat of arms... And apparently, the other languages are also posing problems. I wouldn't mind playing it in English only, as apparently, it's one of the rare languages that are checked.Artifex Mundi, if you begin to get on the slippy road of not checking your translations, you have to know that many people will be disappointed. Grim Legends 3 is one of my favorite games from you, It's awesome. But there is also a level above awesome and the game would have reached it in my book... if the translations weren't badly handled.As it's a collector's edition, you'll find bonus like a bonus chapter as Gabriel after the end of the main story, with also a pseudo-choice of how to end the story (it's only mattering for achievements), concept art, music, etc...So, is Grim Legends a good choice? It's an awesome game. But you should perhaps choose to play it in English if you don't want to be disappointed by your native language. Grim Legends 3: The Dark City is a real must-have, despite these translations problems. I do hope that Artifex Mundi will realize that they need to be more thorough when it comes to them...."

The graphics and cut scenes are amazing, and the story, while part of their standard fare, is still engaging. Plus, some of the Steam achievements are challenging, and run into the bonus story, as well, which is also new.It's good to see the developers that contribute to AM's catalogue improving their games! The Grim Legends line is probably my favourite of the catalogue, and The Dark City has quickly and definitively become my favourite. Definitely worth your time if you enjoy the HOG genre!"

But I don't feel the game has so much charm as the previous ones, and some parts of the game annoyed me a lot.The story doesn’t really match the relaxed gameplay at all, and I think it fits an action game or an RPG a bit better. It felt a bit too action packed for a point and click adventure game’s slow exploration and problem solving gameplay. If there was one thing I certainly didn’t want the series to add it was any sort of fighting mechanic. Which they have done through putting up a mini-game for spell shields.The characters seem a bit more complex than previously, even if the story is still easy to follow. This time we get to see the female protagonist multiple times throughout the game, as the cut scenes can’t decide if they want to be in first person or third person, even if the game outside is in first person. Which I don’t think really work for an adventure game when the character has a backstory and preexisting relationships in the story.It is visually pleasing. The game doesn’t really have any things that are directly harmful, so if you think it looks interesting you should buy it. It does seem like attention and love has been put into the game, I just don’t think the various things match up all that well. As for me, I am glad I bought the three games in a bundle, rather than buying this alone as I had originally considered."
,Recommended,458470,23486762,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,TheCyberDruid,"Grim Legends 3 is a very well made hidden object casual adventure game. There are quite a few points that I'd like to mention though.First of all I'd like to say that while this game has a very intense and interesting atmosphere it simply doesn't fit well in the Grim Legends series. The fairytale theme from the first two games is completely gone and this just feels odd as the third part of that series. That doesn't make the game any less fun to play though.The presentation is great and almost as good as in the first Grim Legends game. There are a few scenes when the characters aren't 3D rendered and instead use the moving 2D image technique that don't look great. This being sad most of the game just looks fantastic and especially the animation is really well done. The music and voice acting is flawless and both fit the atmosphere of the game very well.The story is interesting and quite dark. Both the pacing of and the few twists in the story are great. I'd say that the story is one of the best in any Artifex Mundi game.The mini-games are at last not repetitions of the same mini-games in older Artifex Mundi games. All the mini-games feel new and for the most part are very well made. Sadly the hidden object scenes aren't as amazing as in other Artifex Mundi titles and for my taste there were too many FROGs and 'find x of the same item' kind of scenes. Still those parts of the game are fun and don't ruin the game.The last thing I'd like to mention is that some of the achievements in this game are quite hard to get. This isn't bad, but the one that requires you to finish a hidden object scene in under 20 seconds might be a bit too harsh. I had to replay the game a few times to memorize one scene and then execute it perfectly to get that achievement.Overall it's a great game and I can recommend it even for the full price. If you really liked the fairytale scenario of the first two games and don't like darker scenarios though, you might want to wait for a sale."

I believe that playing the previous games made my expectations grow, yet the third installment could only grant me frustration.I can't precisely point out what, in The Dark City, is responsible for my lack of enjoyment/enthusiasm -- it's all just a big ""meh"". Perhaps it just didn't feel like ""Grim Legends"" at all... Its vibe is raw, unfinished, shallow. The game also seems to be shorter than the previous two, with a 2 hours difference when it comes to completion.I can't complain about the art, the design or the soundtrack -- these have always been Artifex Mundi's highlights, IMO. However, the puzzles and minigames are not as challenging nor as intuitive as the first and second games, respectively; the first two Grim Legends were absolutely brilliant and fun to play, challenging and exciting, beautiful and with a really nice atmosphere.I wish I could say the same about Grim Legends 3: The Dark City.5/10"

Monsters start appearing in the city and you have to find out why and how to stop them.The game's story is in no way connected to the two previous Grim Legends games, and I'm not sure why this is in the same series as this has less of a folktale feeling to it. This should be in its own series imo. Please.Good innovative puzzles and interesting twist on classic ones; interesting plot with decent twists, good graphics and voices all around (the main character is British for a change), well placed achievements, no bugs or glitches. The monsters are really neat-looking and well made. The HO scenes aren't that many or overwhelming, so someone who's not a fan of the genre may still want to try it as a point-and-click/adventure game.The setting has a feel of Assassin's Creed or Batman over them, though of course slightly more feel-good and colourful, though the story is still fairly.. well, grim. There are bossfights and a finishing puzzle with part of the plot revealed for every mini-chapter you complete, which was neat. The inventory is good; each item tells you if it can be combined, which saves you a lot of trouble of figuring out what goes with what."

While the story is similar to the previous Grim Legends games, this time the developers allow us to choose an ending, albeit only in the additional adventure.All in all, if you love hidden object and puzzle games with good story, beautiful art and a diffuclty that is not over-the-top, you will likely enjoy The Dark City a lot."

But if you're in it for a good story, move along.Neat Things:* The graphics kicked it up a notch in this game. Lot's of cut scenes.* Everyone in the order gets the same uniform. That almost inappropriate top buttons undone for men and women alike. This matters a lot to me.* The puzzles and the themes to them were really cool. Everything fit into a theme (even if it was overhanded at times; like the hospital) and pleasing to the eye.* Soundscape was pretty good. Voice acting was better than usual in this series.Meh Things:* What unrealistic battles! There wasn't a time penalty for not acting quickly enough (maybe there is on super hard?). But I can't believe an enemy would just let me sit there and awkwardly pattern match.* The plot. Was dumb. It had potential at first, but then it just derailed in a bad way. And the ending just made me sit back and think: ""did I really just sit here and play this game for this ending?""* The side story. There was perfect potential to side story whatever thing that made the heroine lose her memories (like, idk did she get sick? Was she injured in the line of duty? Fall off a building?? I'll never know!), instead we got something dumb. It's a theme with Grim Legends to have bad side stories. Well, their not *bad* there's just something that's obviously so much cooler and interesting, and every time we get something that is disappointing.* This herione. Isn't that smart. She doesn't prepare well, or think ahead. I don't know if it's because she lost her memories (and that's where she got her accent from?), but, this girl."

During the process together with your mentor u will also be fighting the big bad demon.I'll be very honest I didn't like this HOG that much. The first Grim Legends is much better. I then like the second one. For some reason this Grom Legends just feels wayyyyyyy to different than the last twoAt least the voice acting is very nice, the music was nice as always, the BG was nice, animations are nice, and the art is just amazing. Also lots of cool different things were introduced in this HOG. U actually can combine ur items in your inventory. You can examine ur inventory items to see if that item needs to be disassembled to be used with another item. There is magic fighting in this game. Also some objects u can rotate to look at another side so u can examine the object.Also this HOG has bonus content in which I really enjoyed playing.I guess my biggest problem with this HOG is that it just felt really different than the other two. Also I feel like this game was rushed. An example like there should of been more scenes with the doctor. I forgot his name. Would of been cool to see the doctor more involved in the game. Also because I really liked the bonus content I really wish it was much longer too.I would be rating this a neutral review if there was a neutral rating."

Very flashy! ****

You will be more immersed in the plotline, more appreciative of the art and story and more objective in your appreciation of the game.My wife and I played together and enjoy it. It's not our favorite genre of game, but of the games within the genre, this is good. We highly commend it to you."
,Recommended,458470,30151097,Posted: 24 February,all,maxcorps,This was a interesting one. Doesn't seem to have any connections to the previous 2 games. Decent all around. What struck me what the magic duels. Havn't seen something like that in one of these before. I recommend giving it a shot.
76561198340719239,Recommended,458470,30150079,Posted: 24 February,all,unique_username27,Grim Legends 3: The Dark City is a great puzzle game. We fight as a member of the Order against the monster Koshmaar who threatens our world and discover secrets from our past along the way.The story is intriguing and the characters keep developing as the game goes on. The art is amazing and the cut-scenes are very well made. I also really like the colored-glass-elements in the game.The puzzles range from medium to difficult and are also very varied.I definitely recommnd Grim Legends 3 to any fan of the puzzle genre.

Compared to other games like these it had a change of scenery this time, set in a town/towns.Looks like there is a problem with the achievement ""True hunter - Game on expert"" not unlocking.Edit: Do NOT close the game until you are done with it. I did and True Hunter popped right after finishing the game."

,Recommended,458470,34651929,Posted: 31 August,all,SexBomb,"Oh man, this game is awesome!I've barely booted up and this already feels like the best Artifex Mundi game I've ever played. The cutscene animation is astounding. The scenery, incredible. The voice acting is... well, it's bearable, which is more than can be said for most of the games in this vein. I would even call it good! Even the plot has me completely sucked in... a rarity for any HO.While I haven't made it very far, I can say with absolve that I'm very much looking forward to where this adventure is taking me... and this time I'm not just in it for the puzzles!"
,Recommended,458470,34726629,Posted: 3 September,all,Lyrian,"I've loved almost all the hidden object games I've played by this company, but this one is the best one yet. The puzzles don't feel so arbitrary, they (for the most part) make sense and I never felt frustrated because I couldn't figure out the solution. It never felt impossible because I couldn't follow the developer's logic. Instead, it felt like I could figure it out if I just took some time to mull it over.Also, I love the art style for this title."
