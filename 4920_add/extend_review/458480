But when you arrive at this house, it seems that he crossed it and is in danger, like in your dream! Travelling from world to world, the mysterious guardian is putting obstacles so that you can't complete the artifact in your possession... but why?Mythic Wonders is again a game picked by Artifex Mundi to be part of their publishing catalogue. While I do think that they should develop more their series as they're really good, they're good to choose their games, apart with one or two of them (but one of them was plagued with translation problems  - I should see if they're now patched). Mythic Wonders is the last at the time of the writing.The story is very good as you're jumping from world to world, corresponding to a new power you'll acquire for the artifact. And these are needed if you want to advance: lightning to see darker areas, fire to burn obstacles, water for growing plants, etc.. I didn't really expect the twist at the end, even with the hind dropped.The gameplay is quite standard: use items, find them, clear hidden objects scenes, solve puzzles. The fact that you need to use logic to open the portals are also a nice idea, though I think there was a mistranlation at one moment. Besides, hidden objects scenes are also varied: list of items and shaped. But what I really liked a certain shaped type: runes. It was fun to find symbols in a scene full of them. Puzzles were easy to solve apart for one or two where I had to check a walkthrough because even with the help, I couldn't really understand it.The graphics are quite beautiful, given the different worlds visited. They're always bright and peaceful, even when you're surrounded by lava. It's one of the best I've seen in the Artifex Mundi world. And the soundtrack was also quite good.It's also a collector's edition, meaning an extra chapter in the shoes of an ancestor at the time of the creation of the guardian, concept arts, etc..Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is really one of the gems in Artifex Mundi's catalogue. A very good story, nice landscapes, good gameplay, why ask for more? This is a must-have for hidden objects and casual lovers."

The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.Game AudioI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.GameplayThere are only four difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual, Advanced, Expert and Custom.Journal Notebook has two sections: Notes and Objectives.There are interactive items in the game. Interactive items are marked with a symbol. Most of these interactive items do require extra items before they can be interact with.The interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations.Elemental Artifact is found towards the beginning of the game. But it can't be used immediately because it's elements needs to be found in each of the worlds. Light; Earth; Water; Fire; Air and Aether. Artifact is used in certain situation. Like using the gate portal to access the next world.Most of the hidden object scenes consists of find ""x"" amount, traditional word lists, picture items with little or no interaction. Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the extra content section.Most of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Most of the game's puzzles can be replayed in the extra content section.There's a bonus chapter, but it can be access, only after the main portion of the game is fully completed. The bonus chapter is sequel to the main story.Seventeen different morphing objects to find throughout the game.There are twenty-four different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements do has some requirement before they can be unlocked. The achievements are tied to 'Game Story,' 'Hidden Object Scenes,' 'Puzzle/Mini-Games,' 'Collectibles.'MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/458480"

Along the way, she finds a bronze phoenix statue - the game's incarnation of the philosopher's stone - which she uses to gather the misplaced elements (fire, water, earth, air, etc.) and she uses it to get past obstacles and fight magical forces - including, but not limited to, a dragon, a mysterious phantom, and wild fauna!The game had a nice pace to it, but because there was so much material and lore to cover, there just wasn't enough time to wrap everything up nicely at the end.My one big gripe about the game was its own gimmick and how limited it was.The philosopher's stone - a bronze statue of a phoenix infused with alchemic elements - had a lot of potential; I was disappointed that I primarily used the earth and water elements for puzzles and getting past obstacles in the game.The air and aether elements were only used a few times near the very end of the game - if the game had two more levels to it, all the elements would've had a chance to be used more than once.It was a fun niche, and I found myself wishing that I had been able to use it more, so it's really unfortunate.The only other problem I have with Mythic Wonders is how rushed the ending was for the main and bonus storyline.It's a bit disappointing for the big twist to happen right at the end, just when you've finished gathering all the elements to complete the sorcerer's stone, have a boss battle, and then go right home and act like none of it was that big of a deal.This formula was used in both plots and it just felt choppy.All the lore and glamour aside, this was an enjoyable experience and I'm happy to add the game to my collection.There is some replay value in regards to the relaxing puzzles and cozy backgrounds and atmosphere, so I don't regret buying this at all. I only wish that there was more meat to it."

But you must accept the (*) point at the end and its length.- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is the greatest game of Organic 2 Digital Studio  I’ve played and so that’s a very good Artifex Mundi game too.You play as Emma which has for only family her uncle Alfred but after having recurring nightmares about him she decided to stopped by his apartment to make sure he’s all right. She has been helping her uncle several times to restore a time and space travel device and she feared something went wrong with it. She will then be transported through different area through time and space in order to rescue her uncle Alfred.As every Artifex Mundi game you can move freely in different area and need to solve some puzzles and find all objects in hidden objects scenes. The game has (different difficulties?) and a guest feature: every one of the family can play an independent save and resume the game where they left it. When you first play the game you’ll have a notebook where you have all your objectives as well as all your notes. You also have a map to not get lost. Adding to that you’ll have a hint button that will help you in many ways but be warned that you may not use it in any puzzle or hidden object scene (HOS)or investigation scene (IS). Hints can be used to know where you need to go, where is the next interaction or to show an object or clue in an HOS or IS or to skip a puzzle. To conclude this part, you’ll also have an inventory to store useful items through your journey.Puzzles are very good and different. There are 2 kind of Hidden objects scenes. (HOS) The one where you need to find objects hidden with the help of their name. Colored names mean that you have to interact directly with the scene or use an item in the scene. And the other one where you need to find shapes hidden in the scene.Like some Artifex Mundi games you’ll need to collect a number of Morphing Objects: they appear for a short time replacing the original object.One of the very good thing of this game is that there are 4 unique features you won’t find in any other Artifex Mundi game:•	You’ll need to solve some charade (find the right order with the help of hints) to restore the portals•	You’ll be able to move through time and space with the help of the portals.•	You’ll have a mythic artifact that you need to restore in order to use its powers.•	You’ll have a short action-driving game where you need to avoid every obstacle.To talk about the mythic artifact, it will help you to go further in your journey thanks to its powers. Powers are connected to the different elements like: earth, fire, water, wind but not only. With these powers you can:Light dark places, grow plants, make wind or play some notes and do several other things.(*) :In addition to no skip or use any hint while playing every puzzles and Hidden objects scenes, there are a few more missable achievements. Two of them require you to finish a puzzle or a hidden objects scene in less than one minute. And one hidden objects achievement asks you to find 3 objects within 3 seconds.A collectibles achievement need you to gather every morphing objects of the game, I suggest you to follow a guide in order to not miss any of them.Finally if you missed anything while finishing your first playthrough, you’ll need to play the game again. As far as I may guess you need to play on the same profile to unlock find any morphing you’ve missed. (To not start all over again.)"

You cannot really say anything bad about this game, it is not great nor special but it is ok. Comparing to some other games it is a little longer, recent HOGs tend to be 2 hours thing, while this one gives you almost 5 hours of gameplay. The plot is consistent, not boring and I liked the concept.If you need something relaxing or easy achievements and cards it is a game for you. If your expectations are above average play something else."

Basically you travel through different worlds attempting to find your uncle, and at the same time assemble an artifact based on elements (water, air, etc). But you get almost no back story on either you or your uncle, no idea of how and where you found the plans for the original portal you've constructed together, no nothing.Some of the puzzles are quite frustrating, too.Overall, far from the best Artifex Mundi game I've played."

Stumbled across this (and a few others) in my discovery queue, and since this was the one on discount and not connected to a larger series (yet), I thought I'd check it out to see if this publisher would be worth pursuing. I must say this game is very captivating. Might be from me not being used to such games being this... well-drawn.The puzzles so far have been relatively simple. Do need to work on my speed to get one achievement, but still...Would work as an intro to the genre."

Fantastic voice-overs (truly well above par for HOPAs), lovely graphics, relaxing music.(Side-note: many negative reviewers are claiming the voice-overs are bad. They're either obviously not talking about the English-language voice-overs or they are possibly comparing them to trillion-dollar-budget games which can afford Hollywood stars as voice actors. As far as HOPAs go, this one has some of the best (if not the very best) voice-overs i've heard.)Aside from a couple of the puzzles being... well, truly puzzling (in that it's still unclear to me what they were asking me to solve!), i thoroughly enjoyed this. Short, yes (i clocked just under 4 hours for the main story line), but a pleasant romp through lovely landscapes. Not terribly challenging, but i don't play HOPAs for the challenge, and i mention that aspect of the game only because it appears to be an important port for some (potential) players."

I liked the different realms you visit and the hidden object puzzles but some of the mini games just didn't work for me. Maybe I am not good enough at them or maybe they were just too much. It felt like they appeared more often than you usually get in an Artifex Mundi game. If you are going to be purchashing your first Artifex Mundi game go for Grim Legends. They are the best ones. It is the developer I recommend - I keep trying their games but some series's are better than others.

Beautiful HOS, well built : the objects harmonize the scenes they're thrown into.The storyline isn't from the best I recall from the dozen Artifex games I've played, but it gets the job done.There's just one tiny thing I dislike about these games and Mythic Wonders doesn't avoid this characteristic : young women characters voice acting tends towards teenage voices though they are not young girls! In addition to the loss of authenticity (it doesn't feel realistic), these sharp voices can be irritating on the long term.Apart from that little thing, Mystic Wonders : The Philosopher's stone is another very nice game from Artifex !"
