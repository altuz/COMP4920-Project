,Recommended,458630,26407158,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,ManBearPigeon,"I don't normally write reviews, this is my first one in fact.  But I saw some of the negative reviews and just thought I would put my two cents in.  To start, yes it is a pretty straight forward game.  You won't find much depth here compared to Democracy.  However, what is there is quite fun.  I've only played through a few campaigns so far, but I enjoyed all my experiences.  My first playthrough I just sort of got used to how turns worked and to efficiently use my staff.  I abandoned that game and started a second, and I was pretty easily able to get a landslide victory in Autumn Island (USA basically) on the games default settings.Looking for more of a challenge, I tried a harder difficulty campaign on Winter Island (UK plus Ireland), with a different opponent (you can choose their personality, clean, corrupt, pragmatic or unpredictable.  This effects what kind of staff they hire and how they play the game.)  Anyway, my third game was wildly different from my first.  In the first two games we started out on the east and west coast of Autumn Island and pretty much used the whole time to lockdown states near the start with minimal fighting in the middle of the country over any state.On Winter Island however, the two most populous starting provinces are relatively close, and there is a choke point province between them that can be blockaded to make it difficult for the opposing party to move.  Suddenly I was having to send my staff through neutral and red territory, wasting turns trying to get to a specific province.  The point is, if you choose the easiest map on the default difficulty, win easily and decide to shelve this game, you are missing out.  Solid 8/10 in my opinion."
,Not Recommended,458630,29076813,Posted: 6 January,all,buster_whitfill,"I liked the idea behind the game, and I even enjoyed it for a moment, but after playing through two campaigns with generally negligible differences at moderate difficulty, I quickly realized that I had purchased a game that I would maybe play for an hour or two, and would collect digital dust in my library.Pros - I enjoyed the event scenarios that generated random perks and drawbacks. Stuck in traffic? A police officer will help you out and gain you some logistics points (basically this game's action points), but the scandal will follow you around. A well-connected individual approaches you for some favors for his son? Expose him and gain an uptick in public opinion or help him for added fundraising perks.Cons - Once you've played through the game and learned the mechanics, there is very little challenge to it. Scandals only matter for a few thousand voters and do not seem to impact the election unless it's close (it's never really that close). If you have the money and logistics, the election is easily won. The animal politicians are superficial sprites. They do not give you individual strengths and weaknesses; they're only the representation of your character. You can have a peaceful, religious lion (which matters little except for the preferred campaign platforms for each district) or an aggressive, money hungry mouse.If I had discovered this game for $5 on my cell phone, I might be tempted to recommend it, but for $14.99 on the PC, I think you will thank me for recommending that you spend that money elsewhere."

Customization - I'm very particular about details, so I really, really liked customizing every bit of the traits, skills, and weaknesses of my Lion and staff (my favorite so far is Eduardog the Preacher) and my platform. You also get to choose the length of the campaign, starting funds, and difficulty of your AI opponent. (Since it was my first game, I opted for the shortest campaign, the highest amount of funds and an easy but corrupt AI opponent.)2. Difficulty - it took me some time to get all the actions (e.g. bribing, rallying, raising funds, giving gifts to district patrons), but the tutorial helped a lot. The game uses funds and logistics as requirements for each action, so the challenge lies in effectively using these resources to build your reputation on the island.  Random situations and events will pop up mid game, leaving moral dilemmas. I originally wanted a clean campaign for myself, but when I started losing funds, I found myself agreeing to under-the-table deals for additional funds and patron relationship. (I used influence to help a Patron's child enter a school when he/she didn't pass the entrance exam. (yikes) I also loaned from a cute Shark!)Given that I won by only 100,000+ votes (whew!) against a corrupt donkey in the Autumn Island (the easiest map), I really am looking forward to trying out the difficult maps and competing with their best AI.Has anyone won against a Crazy - level opponent in the most difficult island?3. Strategy from beginning to finish - this game really has strategy written all over it. Every action requires studying the available data about the districts (e.g. population, available funds, concerns, relationship with the patrons) and planning tactics for your next turns. If you prefer research-like tasks like I do, then you might want to try the game out. Also, all actions have a corresponding variety of advantages and disadvantages, so the outcome will really depend on your own strategy. (I gained Patron's support after helping his child, but this made me vulnerable to scandals. Mr. Shark loaned me a significant amount, but he billed me with huge interest during my next turn.)I found Giving Gifts to Patrons helpful in minimizing the logistic costs, but this meant spending more for the gifts at the beginning. I remember opting to change one of my staff to a Bunny who has great taste in gifts for some bonus points.Overall, the customization, sound, appearance, and mechanics made it entertaining for me. :) I’ll see if I can win against a difficult AI without using dirty actions on my next game!P.S. In giving gifts to patrons, developers might want to consider adding another slider for the percentage. I just thought that this way, there won't be a need to move the fund slider back and forth just to reach my desired percentage."

Now's your chance to prove it.... but first, you need to get elected.Political Animals is a game about the campaign trail. The music and art is cute. And the animal sounds are adorable. But behind the cute music hides the fact that you are going to be a corrupt and lying animal. But wait, didn't you want to be on the rightious path? Then, go ahead. But don't expect the other guy to do what it takes to win. They will bribe, cheat, and steal to win the elections.Do you still think you can win an election without any scandal?

The game is beautiful, and funny, I ain't critize that, however it's funny for less than 60 minutes, it won't explain it price.I think, if you expect to play a game like ""This is the police !"" where you choices have an impact on the storyline you will be disappointed to finally find a very simple game with no real challenge nor real randomization of the events, nor real content on your campaign.I wouldn't have posted this review if the price of the game was 4/5 euros, I think it's it real price."

During the Steam Summer Sale, I purchased Democracy 3, which was a little too accurate and frustrating when it came to political simulators. Every path I took seemed to end in death.I am happy to report that this is a much more cheerful political simulator. Croccy may be a cutie, but don't be fooled by his appearance. He will bribe, scandalize, and steal away your voters to make sure that you don't win. Of course, my chosen candidate, Panda, could have done the same, but I guess I'm just one of the few honest politicians left. :PIf I had to complain about one thing, it's that I haven't figured out how to make the reporter point out any of my opponent's scandals, but that's probably user error. Otherwise, there are multiple ways to win over votes for multiple playstyles. I just wish it were multiplayer so that I could play it with friends!"

There are customizable characters, but they are limited. Each animal that are on your staff has a special power and they help you. Also, the game is simpler than democracy in terms of understanding what your staff is doing and what you are doing each turn.But again, I just was not having much fun.The characters are super cute though!I'm sorry for the lack of information. I could only play 40 minutes because it just wasn't fun. Maybe other people like playing games they find do not fun for longer in hopes that it gets better, and for the sake of this game, I truly hope it does. But if you're the type that puts down a game after 48 minutes of just repetitive boring, then I wouldn't suggest it to you.Many of the other positive critics received the game for free. I paid for it. :/"

,Recommended,458630,26443002,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,Naztafari,"Political Animals is an awesome boardgame-esque election campaign simulator with a twist: adorable anthropomorphic animals. In it, you wage war for the hearts and minds of the inhabitants with sorties across equally cute islands (shaped after real countries) in a race to raise the most votes during a campaign period of 15 to 30 days.Brought to you by the artist behind Spacechem and Prison Architect as well as the coder behind Warrior Defense and the publisher behind the Democracy series, Political Animals has a laid-back charm that draws you in with its character - it's like Richard Scarry's animal Busytown with a Pixar-esque adult twist: You can choose to play it clean with your campaign or pull out all the stops with bribery, intimidation, scandals, backstabbing, blackmail and the works. Random events are funny too. While you can win the game with one playstyle, the ability to mix up play styles and customize your character and ""roleplay"" a game is a large part of the fun.Unfortunately, the game is currently single player only (with mind-boggling-to-me AI as a game developer given the depth of the game). The ability to play with friends (or strangers), role-play, trash talk and trade insults would have upped the ante tons. Hopefully it's something in the cards for a future patch if the game makes enough for a round 2 of development.All in all, I give Political Animals an 8.5/10.VOTE PIGGY 2016!"

I had fun enjoyed the feel for the game5. it had a great sound bord and game track ( do wish there was a tad more though)bad- 1.the game was not balanced prouperly upon a full release (skills are to high to make them worth useing or at times they just arent worth it the rng factor can completly kill mutiple turns money isnt balanced well on maps etc)2.  game stopped funcation ( I played though a few campgains and mess with the game useing a trainer to see how the ai worked in such and such. The result was it doesnt the ai just stop broke i had multiple games just up and stop not letting me finish becuse it didnt open the election chart on the last day  heck even a save when they were teching me had the game broke by breaking the end game button.} it needed more testing and polish3. The game lacks multiplayer ( the game was rushed for election season and lets face that it kinda shows with bigs here and there but i am ok with that but what really grinds my gears is i only can play with the computer not a person online or at my house shareing a computer dispite haveing a turn.)4. the staff selection and charecter creation ( A big part of this game i was happy with was the charecter creation but then i relized it was very very narrow you can only build a platform on two things why? why are not all the staff showing up for some animals? why only have one action per turn if i still have logstics why is not paying animals for there work ok)to the develpors and such for there next game and this one but please dont judge it solely on this next point5. Why no user support for mods ( you had a really good base game. so why did you downgrade what chould of been a really cool customization system. You hard wrote the assest into unity instead of haveing them load into the game by a script if you had and then had it read the folder and understand a little bit differntly you chould had a little system to drag and drop the land masses togeather like a puzzle and then you chould draw the the lines  for new maps or a method for custom two demension charecter models and use a set defult walk animation  sure for most it would be a funky animation but it would of atleast allow for artist and such to get a new feel even after playing the game for hours to get those grindy acheviments. you chould retexture all the maps tiles and then save them under the same names etc allowing complete user generated custom content you whould have to make a screen to preview the content in game and the game would have to load in the assest and prehaps saveing a defult folder and maybe a few other deals here and there but   complete user generated custom content especilly since you released on steam i feel would of really extend this game for a long timealso becuse i see that the develpors looks on here a bit i will leave suggestions for this game down below this review1. you should define the staff more the mouse reporter for example well he has his skill his passive traits but useing that skill is hard if he chould move two spots instead of one it would add more diversty. prehaps a passive on coccidle to when he step onto the same tileas a enemy it takes a turn away. so on so fourth a second trait that doesnt really have a cost that chould lead to more mechinas and it would allow for tough ai becuse you chould push hard on stacking up mutiple things onto cheateing computer were they are rigged to have the most advantages reather then smarter ai programming2. get rid of actions per charecter a turn and go for straight all logstics and then one free move and then make it cost x amount allowing so pulling all the money out so on so fourth it will make so much easier for programing the ai to do things properly and it will allow differnt play ways of playing3. make a reward for haveing a full claim to a land a good method to do this is have more events and make the events pop up in claimed land and if you do this give a big reward for the home state kinda areas4. allow us to use all those extra charecters you have please they are just extras in the story but they are kinda cool5. the smaller areas that dont have much money need more motivation as to get there funds like prehaps 1/2 cost or something6. prehapes a day and night cycle day being for all the up front and night giveing you more shady activtys becuse bribeing and playing dirty and giveing someone 20000 to like you  just doesnt feel right when you are out in the openi have more if you need just ask down below for add me and leave a messge or leave a email down or something get creative"
