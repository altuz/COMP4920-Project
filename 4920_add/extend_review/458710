Or is it?Pros:+ Kingdom Rush is a hell of a Tower Defense. This sequel is no different.+ Graphics, little details, Easter Eggs: the charm of the first Kingdom Rush has not lost any magic in this new Frontiers Lands.+ A very good diversity of enemies with some new interesting mechanics (temporary stealth, teleportation...)+ Eight new four-tier specialized towers.+ Some missions offer still more towers (Frankenstein tower, Dwarf bastion...).+ A very decent amount of content.+ Much better mechanics for leveling up heroes.Cons:- This is not a sequel; more like a stand-alone expansion.- Same two magic powers as the original Kingdom Rush.- Many new enemies are just reskins from the first episode.- Some foes are very trick to beat (Sniper lizards, Mage tortoise)- One tower specialty seems to be useful (to the point of being mandatory) only in one arc of the main campaign.- Many issues of the first episode have not been addressed (no fast-forward option, half of the stars just pile up with no use)Verdict: Is it worthwhile? Of course it is! Aren't we speaking of Kingdom Rush? Have the developers been lazy? Wouldn't say so: the content is still of top-notch quality and the game mechanics worked so well anyway that it would have been pointless to change them."

Everything is retained from the first game, but things have been added to; more heroes (that you can level up and upgrade yourself), new towers, new abilities, and the graphics are simplyoutstanding. Each tower got a redesign and everything looks fresh. The startup menu even allows you to choose to play at 30 or 60 FPS if you're into that sort of thing.For those new to the series, you don't have to have played the first game to enjoy this one, although I'd strongly recommend it as Frontiers feels like a direct sequel. I'd easily claim Kingdom Rush to be one of the best Tower Defense games in the entire genre. The game can be controlled entirely with the mouse, but there are a few optional hotkeys on the keyboard you can use to save yourself the trouble of clicking near the edges of the screen. The in-game hints (that act as a tutorial) as well as the first few levels areverybeginner-friendly and serve as an excellent foundation to get you on your feet. If you're in search of a challenge, however, there's a hard difficulty setting (as well as an easy one if you're having trouble) that you can change to at any time without penalty. Each level also has challenge modes that require not even a single enemy to break through your forces. These challenge modes are completely optional in terms of story progression, but are necessary for 100% completion if you're going for that.On a sidenote, I got an opportunity to talk with the devs of the game during one of their livestreams; not only do they actively reply to questions and comments, but they're very nice and easygoing and seem more than willing to address any issues, concerns or questions you may have. From what I've experienced, good devs make good games, and Kingdom Rush Frontiers is definitely a game I'm proud of owning in my Steam library."
76561198263427469,Recommended,458710,30899161,Posted: 2 April,all,Rurik,"The game is so good, so i have bought it to just write a review. I passed this a long time ago.Frontiers is the second game in the Kingdom Rush series.  Actually, when i first time started the game i was pretty dissapointed.  I liked the original KR, but i expected to see something totally new in the second game. For example, new skills, new game modes, etc.. Yeah, Frontiers offers to player new towers, new enemies and new heroes. Also, you have got new map terrains and a new story with comics.. Actually, there are no innovative ideas. Everything is the same. But it is on a proper level. It's like a second season of awesome season one.I realised that i have got negative feelings because my inflated expectations. After i played some hours i chenged my opinion to extremely posititve. I liked this game. I liked to feel the same feelings which i felt playing the first KR. I am sure now, devs did a right choice keepingFrontiers is the most easiest game in KR series. I passed all stages on Veteran for 3 stars without any problems. For example, i still have some unpassed levels in KR and Origins. Anyway, i would advice to play original Kingdom Rush before starting Frontiers.There is nothing really to say about gameplay. If you played KR, you find Frontiers the same game with new towers, enemies and maps. If you didn't, i can say that KR is the best TD game now (I don't consider WC3 maps as a game).There is no secret that it is a mobile port. But it's really qualitative port. No bugs were found. The game looks good on Full screen. Anyway, i recommend to buy this game on mobile. Not because of the fact that the game is a half cheaper on mobiles, but because it is really awesome what you can play such a great game when you have some free minutes (in a public transport, in a queue, etc).I recommend this game to play in any platform you prefer."

It's not quite as good as the original but it's nice to have it on PC anyway, it's still good fun.What I like:- pretty much everything good about the original is still here more or less. It looks great, plays fast and is fun.- new towers, enemies, heroes and environments.- most stages have some unique stuff. New paths being created mid-stage, neutral creatures eating both enemies and your soldiers, stealing gold from a dragon etc.What I don't like:- cave levels are (in my experience) much easier than desert and jungle levels. I played on veteran and I breezed through them while I struggled with some challenges in the earlier stages.- bosses are really, really weak.- this new hero leveling system is weird, it promotes grinding and makes the difficulty curve out of whack. I don't like it.- level 4 specialist towers from the original are nowhere to be found.- necromancer tower is overpowered.- it's shorter than the original. There are more stages coming in future updates though.- ""tap to..."" don't do that. I know it's a port but this is PC."
,Recommended,458710,28384993,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,Antwog,"Kingdom Rush: Frontiers is a tower defence game developed and published by Ironhide Game Studio. It was released in July 2016. Frontiers features a campaign with various storylines in which you progress throughout the game upon successful completion of each level. This review will cover the campaign and the gameplay.CampaignFrontiers features a very fun campaign. There are several stories within the game that incorporate different enemy characters. For instance, the forest allows you to play levels against the cannibal tribe. A second example is near the ocean of you defending against enemy pirates or sea creatures. Frontiers features two extra game modes alongside the campaign, heroic and iron. To play both modes, you must play a level in the campaign mode and earn three out of three stars. These modes add replayability and difficulty to the game because Heroic adds some challenges to a level and Iron bans certain towers within the level, adding an extra layer of strategy. And, the game features 20 different level that amount to 105 upgrade points. I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign.There are various settings in the game, allowing for levels to be in different climates such as the jungle, ocean, mountains. Frontiers shines in the strategic element that you cannot use the same strategy of tower placement each level due to the various types of enemies, but you can create a basic guideline of what works best against an enemy. Ironhide flourishes in creating beautifully designed diverse levels that are not repetitive, are simple, and emphasise strategy. I completed the campaign in 20 hours on normal difficulty, but I only earned 46 out of 105 stars. I found my play through to be enjoyable and not boring because I played the game more in a casual setting and that allowed me to enjoy it instead of quickly playing through it in one day. Back to the point, I believe there is enough content for forty hours of gameplay.GameplayFrontiers incorporates various heroes that are diverse in character and have different abilities. You use these heroes when you play the levels and they gain experience, which levels their character up to level ten. I really like the heroes because it adds a simple and fun mechanic to the game, particularly the diversity in heroes and their strengths and weaknesses against enemy heroes. Furthermore, the heroes complement the four different ally towers in the game, artillery, archery, mage, and barracks. The different towers obviously have different strengths, weaknesses, and have upgrade paths that are liberal in levelling up according to your enemies in the level. For example, if you face heavy armoured enemies and fast-moving wolves, it would be best to upgrade your level three Wizard Tower into a level four Necromancer tower over the level four Archmage tower because the earlier has high damage but also spawns skeletons when you defeat enemies, contrast to the Archmage tower that has extreme damage but very minimal map control compared to the Necromancer tower. I like the variety of towers and upgrades though because the player needs to be strategic about their enemies within a level because not every tower or upgrade is suitable for every condition.The game also has some neat voice acting that I think accurately portrays the type of personalities of each character, ally unit or enemy unit. I found there to be a hint of humour within some characters dialogue lines and I think the overall tone of the characters, their dialogues, and voice acting fits the casual tone of the game. Furthermore, to further capture the casual nature of the game is the artwork that mixes comic-book graphic elements, which I think adds to the overall gameplay and storyline experience.ConclusionI highly recommend Frontiers. I played the original Kingdom Rush in Flash on the Internet and I believe it has evolved since then without heavily altering the core mechanics of it. In saying that, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Frontiers and I found barely anything of fault with it if I am honest, I knew what to expect with this game. I particularly highlight the map design and the stories as a core component out of the game because that is what adds the uniqueness and continuous freshness to the game without staleness. Therefore, I highly recommend Kingdom Rush: Frontiers at the full price of USD$9.99.Rating10/10Pros- Map design.- Various storylines within the game that take you on a journey through different settings.- Diversity in ally and enemy characters and their character traits.- Frontiers strategic element that alters every level.Cons- If I had to nit-pick, I would have liked some more towers.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Bugged Ironhide about when they'd release a PC version and they were all ""we have no plans for that, sorry.""  So long story short, here's the PC version.According to the dev, there will be frequent updates until all of the Heroes and levels from the mobile version are available in this one as well.  ""except maybe the Endless stages"" but I don't know why they'd exclude those; if I order a steak but I'm sitting on the patio do I not get butter with it? Is butter only for those who eat their steak on mobile? >:[If you liked Kingdom Rush, Frontiers is more of the same only better.

For me this series is one of the best Tower Defense games for the PC.The graphics are clean and cute.The sound effects and music are perfectThe gameplay is just great. You will find long Levels and you have to adapt your strategy. I like the tower, enemy and hero variations and especially the surprises in the levels. The best for me is that it`s not too easy. You really have to find a different strategy to finish each level (you can choose between casual, normal, hard) I think it is obvious that I love this game :)You will get a lot of play time just with the campaign. And when you are done with that don't forget to try the iron and heroic mode for each level which will give you an extra challenge. For Kingdom Rush I have 80hours + of playtime and for sure I will play both parts again in the future.Overall,I can only recommend buying this game and trying it out.

,Recommended,458710,26006386,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,February,"The best Tower Defense series on Steam, hands down.Score: 8.5/10Pros:Rich in detail, as per usual.Distinct units and towers.Beautifully crafted visual experience.New mechanics compared to the first game - new enemy paths opening mid-stage and stage-related objectives, which can prove to be helpful during the run.A few more interactive, map-specific units compared to the initial game.Great music and SFX.Lots of hidden achievements throughout the stages.Cons:Worse hero progression approach compared to the first game. Results in quite a bit of unnecessary grind to get all the heroes maxed, where - in the end - you will stick to only a select few anyway, due to their specific abilities. Do note that this hinders the overall experience in no way, really, as it is a post-game issue; one can easily finish the game with the starting hero, not having tried the others at all.Sudden difficulty spikes in a couple of stages (like 2 or so) that can throw you off.No real incentive to play at any difficulty higher than Casual (Normal or Veteran), as there are no achievements related to it.Game suffers from the same issue as the first one, being that once you get to doingHeroicandIrondifficulties, you end up with an absurd amount of additionalStarsthat cannot be used on anything, as the upgrades available in the game only utilize so many of those.Some issues with Cloud saving (people mentioning those issuse are in huge minority, though)As you can tell by the score, the cons listed didn't really affect it much and should be treated as ""I wish this was in the game"" complaints of a die-hard fan, more than anything else."
76561198114036996,Recommended,458710,24538950,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Chabow Jackson,"I learned to love many Tower Defence Games over the years. The original Kingdom Rush onArmorgames.comwas amongst my favorites, thus I did not hesitate to buy its updated version as a fullpriced game on Steam. Seeing this successor made me wonder if the quality could hold up to my expectations; after about an hour of gameplay I have the feeling that I will indeed love this game- as it builds upon the strengths of its predecessor while adding some improvements.I will first speak about the Kigdom Rush Series as a whole, before getting into detail with Kingdom Rush Frontiers.What are the strengths of the Kingdom Rush series?Style:First of all the lovely art and sound design; if you are able to bear the sight of a comic look you will notice that the drawings may not be at the peak of 2d-graphics (probably due to the games flash/mobile origins) - but that they do have a decent style on them that makes them distinguishable from other TD-Games. The sound itself is a combination of a decent background music (neither is it outstanding,nor is it irritating) and wonderful catch-phrases by your troops/towers.Gameplay:Kingdom Rush is that kind of TD-Game where the path of the enemy units can not be influenced by your towers as you are building them next to the walking-path at specific locations (therefore: no mazes and no towerspamming till the map is full). However, one of the four towers you can build is a ""melee-tower"" which spawns three soldiers at a location you can can choose within its influence area - this gives you the opportunity to block enemies on the road with a fight - while your towers are tearing them apart. Micromanaging the spawning locations ofthese troops - as well as your powerfull hero character and your two spells - while planning your tower upgrades makes for a pretty intense experience in which you will forget that there is no button for fast-forwarding; as you are much more actively involved into the gameplay as you usually are in a TD-Game.What improvements does this game bring to the series?First and foremost it is the leveldesign that was improved; while the first 6 stages offered a nice variety of artstyle it is the uniqueness of some gameplayelements in those maps, that made them really distinguishable -  without any spoilers: new paths are created and there are more interactive objects than before.The heroes feel more powerful and unique than in Kingdom Rush.Is it worth buying?That - as always - depends on your experience with Kingdom Rush and TDs in general and of course the price of the game.If you played Kingdom Rush and liked it you will like this one too. If you like TDs in general but never played Kingdom Rush - give the original a try. If you do not like TDs but are still reading this review I really do question your priorities."

76561197983740996,Recommended,458710,24741009,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,Chane,"'Kingdom Rush Frontiers' is the second game of the 'Kingdom Rush' tower defence game series. Like it's predecessor it's a port from iOS and Android but that does not diminish the quality of the game. It's a very enjoyable, colourful, comic style, strategy game that's not to be missed if you like tower defence games.Pros:- cute comic style- traditional path-based tower defence game- loads of pop-culture references to films like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Castaway, Predator etc.- maps can change in the middle of the action when enemies create new paths- challenging- cool boss enemies that can make your whole defence setup worthless- three difficulty levels plus Iron and Heroic difficulty with completely different waves of enemies- more than 40 types of enemies- complex combination of towers with different special abilities- special attacks- nine different heroes with very different special abilities- looks and plays like the original - yes, that's a good thing- addictive- maps contain secrets- upgradeable towers base values- upgradeable heroes base values- no glitches, no bugsCons:- absolutely none"
,Recommended,458710,33562048,Posted: 15 July,all,Artibius,"PROS:+ great art style+ awesome tower defense elements+ cool puzzles/levels+ fun achievements+ level specific events+ Heroic & Iron mode level variant+ 16 heroes to choose from+ 22 levels (66 with Heroic & Iron mode)CONS:- Kingdom Rush Origins is not on Steam- some people will find it too easy compared to Kingdom Rush- not all heroes are useful in the more difficult stages- makes you angry when that last minion ruins your perfect scoreComment:After playing and really enjoying Kingdom Rush I was happy that the sequel appeared here on Steam. This game is possibly easier than Kingdom Rush as less of a specific mix is needed. Towers often have special variants that make them eventually viable for almost any enemy. This is the trade-off so you can play the way you want. Three expansion unlock after finishing the main campaign, each adds new units to make the gameplay fresh and a bit more difficult. You have a lot of heroes to choose from but apart from maybe the expansions there is no real reason to level them up. You can just pick the one you like and get him to maximum level and just keep using him/her. Though I have to say not all of them are usable in the later levels, especially the expansions. I had an occasional game freeze (FPS drop) when a tower is built or hero revives but it happened only on some levels and not always. During the campaign most of the stages have a special event (sand worm, ship cannons, etc.) that makes the gameplay more dynamic as you have to adjust to event while fighting enemies. Overall a really great sequel and definitely a game to check out if you are into tower defense games!P.S.:Great Defender, Heroic Defender & Iron Defender probably only unlock in Normal or Hard difficulty (this was the case in the first game), but you only need to finish the first 15 levels to unlock them------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on theCurator pageor in myReview Corner."

,Recommended,458710,24926042,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,Wirdjos,"Frontiers is a direct sequel to the original Kingdom Rush. There are new enemies, new heroes, and new specialized towers to experiment with, but the interface - down to the first three upgrades of each tower - should be familiar to anyone that's played Kingdom Rush before. Heroes, however, now gain permanent levels along with their own skill trees which adds a further sense of progression and greater range of options. Those options come in handy as difficultly has a habit of suddenly spiking in the middle of a level forcing one to adapt quickly or face starting back at wave one.This installment is not quite as lengthy as its predecessor, but free updates, including several new heroes, have already been promised to bridge the gap. However short it is at the moment, Kingdom Rush Frontiers delivers plenty of the same tower defense brilliance, background details, and pop culture references that made the original such a favorite in the genre - which is more than enough to justify its modest price tag."

Artillary fires powerfull aoe attacks but slowley and mages use powerfull magic attacks. Each tower you will upgrade 3 times and then get a choice of 2 finale upgrades. Each finale upgrade does a different thing depending on your play styke.Enemies:There is a huge varaity of enemies in this game. Each collection of levels has a setting and the enemies fit the setting well. For example, the desert stage consists of bandits and scorpions. The only thing is that each stage has basicly a re-skinned version of the troll from the first game and the orc from the first game. But other then that you encounter new and unique enemies that you must adapt to defeat.Stages:I metioned this a bit above, but there are a variaty of stages that you will fight through. You start in the desert, were you fight off worms from tremmers and bandits, go to the jungle and battle with the cannabalistic tribes, and finish the campiagn in the dark depths carvens and defeat the lizardmen. Once this is done, you unlock the halloween levels and the beach levels, and maybe a mushroom level(that might be in the first game I forget). Each stage has new enemies, sometimes towers, new terrian, and twists.Stratagy:Your stragagy in this game is important! Why, becuase its a stratagy game. And each tower will play into it. I said above that each tower is different and brings new attacks and ways to bring your enemies to there knees. For example, the necrmancer can summon the souls of enemies you have defeated and have them fight for you. While the ax throwers can make enemies take more damage and remove magic ressistince.OtherThe screenshots:I just want to say that the guy whose screenshots are getting overrun of a few of them.The Haloween LevelsThere back, there fun, not much else to say.ConsLess extra levels then the first game:I love the extra levels from the first game, I think it was the most fun part, and there were like 10 new stages with like a total of 15-16 levels. This game I think has 3 new stages and 8 new levels, something like that. I would like to see the orcs and the trolls in frontiers. Also, for those who are completely lost becuase they dont have the first game, the extra levles, or bonas levels, were levels unlocked once the story was completed. They were extra hard and introduced new enemies and almost all ended in a boss fight. I wanted more once I beat the game.Only new towers and heros:Wouldn't it be cool too see the musket men supporting a mech? or Thor doing battle with savages? Nope, instead of also having the old towers and heros along with the new ones, we just get to new ones. F*cking sucks. Dont get me wrong, I like Necromancer more then archain wizerd and assassin more then templar knights, but, cant we have both?9/10"
,Recommended,458710,34192421,Posted: 12 August,all,Tablis,"This game is an improvement over the originalKingdom Rush- which was already great. The towers are all new (at least the advanced onces), fun to use and also seem better thought out. The overpowered lightning tower is gone, but there is even crazier stuff available now. Where the tower design in the first game was somewhat cautious, standard fare for TD games, here the developers let loose their imaginations and it works out. I also appreciate that many towers now have animations showing which upgrades were purchased.There is a wide array of heroes to choose from and this time progress (leveling) is persistent! There are more map-related elements now like unique towers, heroes that appear only for one map, environmental hazards and so on. Another nice touch is that you don't need perfect performance to get 3-star ratings - it's possible to let a few enemies past and still get the top grade. Once again though, you run out of upgrades to purchase halfway through the game and then you're just collecting stars for no real reason. The story is... kinda lacking, but then who plays a TD game for the story? Not me."

It's the second game in the Kingdom Rush trilogy, and also the second one to hit Steam, and it is a tower defense game, esentially.The concept of gameplay and story is pretty simple: evil guy wants to rule land hurr durr, build towers to spook them, then go after the bad guy yourself and defeat him. And you know? It isn't called Kingdom Rush for nothing, I mean your kingdom is under attack of another kingdom, you defend succesfully and just go after the enemy's♥♥♥♥♥ You'rerushingyourkingdominto his face! As much as it sounds like fun, well, it is!Now the gameplay itself consists of you defending a couple of pathways from enemies to reach your booty and you have to build specialty towers for that. There are a total of 4 towers to construct and each one has 3 normal upgrades and 2 branching ones, which change their gameplay all-together or are just straight upgrades to the normal towers, which both options are still nice. Apart from the towers, you also get to choose a hero to help you out in your journey, and you unlock more as you play, and what can I say other than that they all have unique properties and abilities and I'll leave the magic of discovering for yourself ;)Now as of the game's release there is only the campaign available to be played and there are only half the heroes available compared to the mobile version, HOWEVER, all of the remaining special levels as well as the heroes are going to be updated a tad bit later and everything will be perfectly fine, as believe me, all of that content is worth your while.bUT mr. ReVIeWeR, hoW CAn YoU be So surE tHey wiLL aDd thEm?!?It's simple: proof of Kingdom Rush 1. At launch, not everything was available right away, however in a couple of good working months, all that was promised, as well as its own Steam exclusive levels were added in updates and everyone lived happily ever after. Except for Veznan lolNow for the levels themself have been improved quite a bit since its predecessor, and pretty much a vast majority of 'em have special encounters you have to keep an eye on, some being fun, some being challenging and a lot being annoying :)And lastly, 2 more things before Imma go finish the last heroic level: the soundtrack is just as epic as you expect it to be, that's one. Two: each enemy and unit has it's own character portrait, but the towers do not anymore. That made me quite sad, since the ones in the original KR kicked♥♥♥♥♥tl;dr Welp, it delivers what you expect: a solid tower defense game. Now I am not a fan of strategy games at all, but I do recommend this game for anyone, regardless of preferences, as it's just simple to learn and understand and it's just that addictingly good. The final verdict for Kingdom Rush Frontiers as of it's release is a well worthy 9/10. If you're willing to go get this game when all of the levels and heroes have been pushed out, well let me tell you(and this will skip me an edit in the future, trust me) that your game is worth a 10/10! But why a perfect rating? It improves on everything that the original game had, which is strategy and imagination, with more creative towers, more creative enemies and heroes alike as well as the levels.This has been your random reviewer, leaving his opinion and going. The choice of purchase is all up to you. Have a nice day!Final note edit: Did you know there's a toilet paper emoticon from this game? Now that's true devotion to emoticons! :krtp:"

You can't do else but love what you see there, just like watching cat videos on Youtube.Each of the 3 difficulties is well balanced, with the hardest one being a tough challenge where you might need to restart the round a few times and rage about this one dragon flying past your 10 artillery towers.Did you already play Kingdom Rush and enjoyed it? Why do you still struggle to buy this one? The game's style remains the same, towers and heroes are different so you don't get bored!This sounds like brainwashing, are there any cons?The price of currently €10 compared to the playtime of approx. 30h when doing every stage in normal, heroic and iron is maybe a little high, especially for a tower defense game.

Some levels on ""Veteran"" difficulty seem a bit brutal till you figure out how you're supposed to fight.Completed it all on Veteran difficulty, with Heroic and Iron challenges. Loved the difficulty - some levels are puzzling and brutal, although none are impossible, you just have to figure out how to do it.Loved Heroic challenges, some were rather hard. Iron was a little disappointing, I remember there being one tough level, others were a breeze after beating Heroic (it comes sooner in the list).

Fairly certain that was the devs that requested that, so you know <3 Ironhide, they respect their fanbase. Even without the coupon, if you've played the first game, you'll love this one.They've upped the strategy, and made heroes more than just a point and click go here and stand your ground. Control upgrade points as they level up. Heroes keep their levels after battle but it takes a significantly larger amount of time to level them up, levels are unique to each hero. Hero A at level 7? Well, Hero B is at level 3, go grind some earlier levels to level that guy up. Distribute level up points into unique skills for each hero.Towers have been changed/tweaked, new upgrade paths and gimmicks (the Archery Tower's final upgrades are actually useful now), further you go up certain tower, the more synergy you get with other towers around it, Archery tower for example, has a side path upgrade in one of the level 4 upgrades that effects all towers around it with increase range (has to be a mage, another archery, or bombard tower), also gives chance for criticals to all those towers. Smack an archery tower in the middle of the group and spam the upgrades, watch as your Mages get blown-out-of-the-water range on their attacks.No new towers though, I'd have hoped for a 5th choice, not just the original four you get in the first game. Oh, new map by the way, and of course it's very pretty.New Environments, new enemies, same great feel.My experience this far is that the levels are a lot more close to challenging than they were in the first game, where it was either too easy or too hard. I feel like if I just tweak my strategy in someway with my tower setup/troop positioning/upgrade purchases I'll be successful.

Having just finished the campaign, I can say that this was a worthy sequal to the original Kingdom Rush. The maps got progressively harder, but not impossibly so, and the new upgrade towers were quite fun to experiment with.

I played this series for many hours on my phone and tablet, and still couldn't wait to get this on Steam.I just started playing this version, but it looks like they've improved quite a bit. They've gotten rid of the micro-transactions, upgraded the graphics, hero system and towers.There are 15 levels currently, with bosses every few levels. Each level also has 3 difficulties that usually require different strategies to beat.

Ironhide brings you the same great art style, defense mechanics, new and old tower upgrades, a plethora of new enemies, AND to spice things up, we have unique Heroes to command on the battle field.Now, I've read a couple reviews which put the Hero system in a negative light. Personally, for me I really enjoyed it. Honestly, I played with one hero the whole time. Mirage, which is a clone creating, thief type Hero. Now, let me tell you that each Hero is very unique with their own pros and cons. I gravitated towards Mirage because her abilities matched my playstyle. I also messed around with the Wizard, the Alien dude and the final Dragon that you get. Ultimately, always coming back to Mirage. The Heroes are here for you to test and have fun with, not to be over whelming on the battlefield, which they are not.Kingdom Rush is my favorite Tower Defense game and it's my favorite game to just pick up and play for 20 minutes or so at a time.We will also be receiving FREE MONTHLY UPDATES. Yup. Ironhide is one of those game developers thatgetsit. The last week of each month we will receive two new heroes and a new campaign. This game is loaded for only $10. Well worth the price.The game itself takes around 12 hours to complete. If you want to collect all the stars so you can fully max out your traits, then you'll be putting a bit more time into it. I'm at around 25 hours as of this review and I'm coming close to 100% completion of the base game.I can't recommend this game enough! It's truly a gem."

A completely new set of new enemies, new heroes and 22 new levels... more than you can shake an oversized Dwarven bombard at (or at least enough to shut you up for a good 20-30 hours).The Tier 4 towers have also undergone an overhaul, providing a new set of tactics and toys to play with; from assassins, to battle mechs... and, most deliciously, a freakingNecromancer Tower. Finally... Nowyou'rethe one who gets to summon armies of the undead! The new towers feel well-balanced and have a diverse range of special abilities that seem to promote a much stronger focus on synergy than before, at least from my experience (though the Necromancer can feel a little overpowered on lower difficulties).The only major change (which is hard to say if better/worse) is that the heroes now retain their exp between levels. Where, previously, they'd go from 1-10 in a single level - you now level them up throughout the game, adding earned points into to cool abilities and passive upgrades. Whilst it adds a nice RPG element to your favourite heroes... it can equally add a grind factor if you wish to play with the full range on offer, as you'll need to level them up individually. And obviously, if you wish to try any new heroes, you'll need to levelthemup to the same as your current ones to be able to provide a meaningful comparison. So swings and roundabouts really... But the hero you use is more for your own fun, so it's not like you're hindered from finishing the game if you only wanted to stick with a handful or even just the one - in which case this isn't a problem at all.Other than that: Same loving attention, same cracking array of challenges and same humour... What's not to love? And at 60 fps, it looks smoother than ever before."

To name a few: the hero level-up system the five skills, the tower types and bonuses which require lots of synergy and real tactics to be efficient... etc...The longevity is also in my opinion higher, for the player who is not the typical expert looking for a worthy challenge. This longevity is mainly given by the fact that it is interesting to tinker with the heroes and how they progress and improve as they level up.The story is the usual revisited quest to defeat an evil lich/demon, whatever, but the variety and originality of the enemies and the towers is more impressive than the first game, in my opinion.Overall I'm extremely satisfied of the purchase, although the price should be set at 5 euros in my opinion.

Even more than in the original one. From Predators to Wilhelms you are gonna have fun trying to find ´em all+Amazing sound track. I would recommend finding the OST on YouTube and listening it, especially the Boss Battle soundtrackCons:-Bosses are too easy. Maybe it´s just the fact that I have completed each KR like 5 times, but these bosses are ez to slaughter.-The game is being updated, but rather slowly...Maybe I am just bragging, but it will take 3 more months until the game is fully done.-No endless mode. I need that thing in my life. It is so much fun to try to get a high score in these levels, please add them. Even the locations where the challenges take place are marked on the map!-The new hero system is a bit annoying. It took me 22 levels just to level Mirage (one of the starter heroes) all the way to max, which annoys me so much. I want to experiment with different heroes, but that is too annoying when a hero can´t get even one level up from one stage.Final thoughtsI love the KR series. Like I said, I have completed all the games ATLEAST 5 times on veteran, all stages. This is why I bought this game as soon as it dropped, and I hope that this means that they will give us KR: Origins too, playing it on mobile is too annoying. Overall I also appreciate the devs behind the games. Like for real, the amount of detail, secrets and easter eggs on these games is mind blowing! Like I mentioned earlier, each leve has something unique in it, usually even more than one thing! These devs just put so much work into their games and I am going tobuy KR:O if it ever comes out, alongside with Iron Marines.Would I recommend it? ♥♥♥♥ yeah. It is gonna be worth those 10 bucks, specially if they are gonna add something ""special"" like they hinted.

They fixed some issues such as a too small cursor (I have a 27"" monitor and a small cursor gets lost).Lots of interesting units and towers and the levels in the campaign are mostly well balanced. I did dislike the final boss battle - the 15 rounds of the battle were fine (actually very easy) but fighting the boss was a pain. I read up on the forums where people say you should save up 2000 gold, I saved up 5000 and still found it really tough. But I did beat in with 3 stars on normal difficulty, which for me is good."

,Not Recommended,458710,30932062,Posted: 3 April,all,Rook,"Kingdom Rush Frontiers is a fine tower defense game, but its relatively standard gameplay does little to set it apart from its competitors.  If you are looking for a tower defense game to play, I would recommend Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten instead, because it does much of what Kingdom Rush Frontiers tries to do, but better.Particularly glaring in Kingdom Rush Frontiers is the lack of a fast-forward button, which has become standard in the genre for a reason.  The game has little downtime, but levels can take 15 minutes or more to complete, so replaying them for a better score at 1x speed can be annoying.The four tower types are unique, but I thought some of the tower specializations were underpowered.  The numerous heroes have a good variety both thematically and gameplay-wise, and were enjoyable to discover.  It would have been nice to be able to more actively control them, because you are given only two spells to affect the battle with in real time.Kingdom Rush Frontiers has fewer but longer levels than most other tower defense games I've played, but the enemy and map variety keeps things interesting enough.  One highlight was the iron challenges, which disable certain tower types to provide a short but focused challenge.For the most part, the tooltips are of acceptable quality, though sometimes they refer to having ""a chance"" of an effect rather than giving numbers.  The metagame is pretty barebones; it mostly consists of upgrading your towers along a linear path.The story is essentially nonexistent, which I have no problem with.  Don't expect any real characterization or plot developments.Kingdom Rush Frontiers held my interest, but unfortunately, I see no reason to recommend it over Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten.  I enjoy standard tower defense games, but the sad truth is that if you fail to innovate, you run the risk of someone else making the same game, but better."

And also it had some elements I dont like in a td game (split paths, no fast forward).  I put in a lot of hours an had some fun, but overall, could not get over the negatives.Then I got KR: Frontiers on android. It had a Shop where you could purchase items that made a massive difference - and it was exactly what the game needed. So I said to myself, I'll definitely buy this on steam, bc KR graphics are too tiny to enjoy on android imo.So I bought KR Frontiers on steam, and guess what - the Shop is not in this version and never will beSo, another Kingdom Rush game that sucks.

Also, the larger number of heroes with individual leveling needed per hero seems a bit more annoying in this game than how the leveling of heroes and the number of them worked in the first game. The overall difficulty, however, is what really put me off here, because I felt like it was perfect in the first game, but excessive this time around. If you wanted a harder Kingdom Rush, this game is for you, but if the first one felt just right, this one might be a disappointment for you, as it was for me."

Well They decied not to put them in. What a huge dissapoitment I spent $10 hopeing to get the endless Levels. Just know when you finished the game you are done there is nothing left to do but wait for them to add updates.  I hope they change their minds and put the endless levels in.  They could still put in the gem store and make mony off micro transactions.Over all its a good tower defenese game. Its fun an challenging and has great art.

Your towers are inconsistent, lie about their ranges to your face, and upgrade descriptions are often vague and unhelpful. Cap it all off with critical 'Champion' characters who not only must be manually directed but levelled *individually*, and you have a recipe for a game that starts frustrating and quickly veers into boring: After all, there's also no visible-map pausing, no fast-forwarding, and no checkpointing...

No soul, no graphics, no atmosphere. Now I'm sure that the soul lives only in such masterpieces of oldschool like warcraft. At this point I could complete the review, but I want to ask one question for all readers:Why you encourage unscrupulous developers and buy these games? Oh, sorry - ""games"". Very funny and sad to watch how the parodies of Warcraft maps (which are disguised as the original games) sell for huge amounts of money... Why are tens of millions people play DotA and other MOBA games? Why do they pay for these games, if they can just download a free map for Warcraft? Honestly, I don't understand this foolishness...

The graphics are nice, the gameplay is fair but not too easy, and the upgrades provide many different ways to power up your towers, the heroes are an interesting way to more directly involve the player, and the towers have many interesting abilities. There is one bug that annoys me, however. When a tower is being upgraded, the numbers for the next level are ALWAYS green, even when that stat is being decreased, say for example the Axe Thrower specialization for the archer tower. The upgrade tower menu shows that both the increased damage AND SLOWER fire rate in green. Wouldn't the slower fire rate be in red, to show that the stat is being decreased? While some may say ""Oh you are just nitpicking."" HOWEVER, in the flash version, this is not the case, as it shows increased stats in green and decreased stats in red. So, please Ironhide Studios, just fix it. I understand it's a small feature, but still. This bug also exists in the Steam version of the original Kngdom Rush, so maybe fix it there too.

It does have bumps on the road however and can be incredibly frustrating, especially with the introduction of the Sand Wraith, an upgraded version of the enemy spawn unit from the first one.The pro's of this game have been listed by many people, maps are enjoyable, able to find and click things for a bit of amusement, and towers are a ton of fun to figure out which works and doesn't. Feels like the old one but with updated and new versions that feel at home in this game. Which is weird to see someone list that as a con but honestly a Paladin guild would not fit in a desert setting as opposed to a assassins guild they have in this one.The main cons of this game that I feel are the hero's, introducing a very grind system into the game that should not be a part of it especially since you can only use  your hero's on the 'campaign' parts of these maps, they're taken away during heroic and Iron situations. The hero's themselves are enjoyable and appear to all be unique and fun but very weak as well to the Desert Archer swarms which can be a bit difficult to handle if somone is new due to how fast they can rip the hero apart. The other part would be the Sand Wraith. The first game had a Necromancer which did a similiar thing of spawning 4 skeletons peroidically while having a ranged attack but easy to handle due to how far into the game they're introduce, giving the player a chance to be able to handle them. The hero's as well were capable of beating on them due to progressing in levels during the campaign, not a grind mechanic this one has. They work with spawning a coffin at a random location, ahead of them, in the samel lane they are (so yes they can spawn past your militia barracks). This is a huge problem as they'll also spawn more than just 4 mummies so easily able to get swarmed and suddenly over burdened. This wouldn't be an issue if they were somewhat squishy but they have half as much health as an Executioner who's supposed to be the Ogre (except he has one hit kills majority of the time) with 1400 health. The Sand Wraith's stats are HP: 700 DPS: 30-60 ranged AR/MR: none MS: Slow and thankfully only take 1 hp away. The bad part though with its slow MS it spawns more than enough tombs to release a swarm of mummies and towers will focus the mummies over the Sand wraith which you have zero control over. They'll also kill your militia quickly if you try and move them to handle it. Early on Hero's will not be able to handle it or help as well. I did the mistake of not leveling up my reinforcements and meteors apperantly as that's the only way I find to slow them down and when the wraiths are distracted with melee attacks they'll still spawn mummies. This is something of a huge turn off for me as i've actually RQ now due being so quickly being overwhelmed by 3 wraiths who spawned in close succession (without rushing the next wave in).Outside of those two things this game is once again incredibly enjoyable and a very welcoming feel to the TD genre. It can be frustrating, especially with tower placements at times, but that's the challenging part of it as well. Finding the best ways to maximize your Militia and defense towers range/damage. No tower is better than the other as each one is required to beat a map, the hero's are a welcoming part (in my mind) to the TD genre. The upgrades can feel a bit forceful in what you have to get first in this one however but make the game give a reason to actually get more stars and do better.  I still recommend the game, even though the Sand Wraiths are a huge turn off as well as the grinding feature in a TD game."

The tower specializations have differed (and are quite interesting) but the basic purposes are still the same. The enemies are different but the general premise is unchanged. There are new heroes, but the purpose of having a hero on the field is the same. So if you liked KR, you'll like KRF; and conversely if KR wasn't your thing, KRF is not sufficiently different that your opinion will be altered.So, assuming you enjoyed KR, you'll find KRF an enjoyable revisit. It's got plenty of new challenges, interesting new towers, and incorporates a subsystem of certain enemies' abilities being ""magical"" so that you can negate them with a particular tower upgrade.Forewarning: The final boss of the campaign is kind of BS (spoiler: it can just straight-up delete a few of your towers and there's nothing you can do to stop it) but that's mostly just going to cause you to retry the stage and adjust your strategy (namely: keep leftover money instead of spending it all on upgrades at the end of the last wave)."

What piques my interest with this one is how funny the characters are and how they used references from other games to Indiana Jones and the Predator just to name a few. Everything has been made so well and the gameplay is so fluid. The game has achievements based on many other game references hidden pretty well in a level for example ""Finding Reptile from Mortal Kombat"". This makes me so curious as to what is hidden and got me searching thoroughly throughout a whole single level (and there are tons of levels).

It's perhaps better to see this game as a gigantic expansion to the first, protected from accusations that it should have just been DLC by the first game's colossal amount of extra content existing beyond the main campaign and within the base game and the large number of variations that Frontiers has made to tech tree progression, enemy types, and map interactivity.What it boils down to is simple - if you like tower defense games, buy both of the Kingdom Rush ones.

It's simply more of the same with a different setting and different ultimate towers. The upgrades (which you purchase with stars) haven't changed at all, those are all the same. The heroes on the other hand are all new ones, each with their own unique abilities. Newly added to the heroes is a level system. So you don't have to level up your hero while in a match every time over and over. Also new is the enviromental traps (and a few ones that help you as well).I can only say possitive things about this game. It's highly addictive and lots of fun!"

I would question the price tag considering the amount of content and also that fact that you can play it online for free. However the port from mobile is good and I have had no issues with the game.My only gameplay issue I have is that is seems to force you to play in a certain way. Early on if you unlock a new tower or hero you better use it or you going to have a hard time.I completed the main story about 12 hours, I got stuck on a couple level for sometimes and played on casual. There are some bonus challenges that you can do but its a bit dull for me. The challenge take away your hero and some of the towers you can place.Tl/dr: Go online to play it, unless you want an awesome full screen experience."

The advanced Towers have all changed, which is both a blessing and a curse (no more spamming Tesla Towers for easy wins!), and the enemies have been switched around as well to present you with whole new challenges. You'll face tribal shamans who can make their allies all but impervious to specific damage types, enemies with multiple forms, necromancers galore and all manner of tricky foes that will need smart planning to defeat.Frontiers feels a lot harder than its predecessor, in no small part due to the need to counter all manner of enemy casters that wander down your lanes. Thankfully, you can always lower the difficulty if things get overwhelming.If you're new to Tower Defense, try picking up the original Kingdom Rush first.

They're usually pretty well balanced. Even on hard, most maps still allow for some variation. so you're not stuck with only using a specific pattern to win a map.Overall, the game is excellently made. Lots of references to popculture, like the previous one.not to say that there aren't some cons:like the first game, you accumulate a ton of stars that just sit there and nothing can be done with them.no way to make or dl user-made maps.new hero system isn't necessarily an improvement over the old. while experimentation is still somewhat possible, the repetition to get later-stage heroes leveled up is a disincentive and most players probably won't bother.there could have been more challenges or more varied challenges instead of just the 6 wave / 1 wave. (user generated maps could probably addressed this in a creative way)To reiterate, KR:F is a great TD game, but because the KR series was initially conceived just for the smart phone and flash game markets it lacks some of the features that would make it an even better series for the PC market.""Stay Frosty!"""

Even a slightly wrong upgrade can be costly.- Even if you put all the right towers to all the right positions, you still need to micromanage. That means, locating your hero correctly, upgrading towers right on time, using the militia/meteor thingy right when/where they are needed.Cons- There isn't an Encyclopedia button in game.

Frontiers implements a hero upgrading system and more powerful heroes overall.  The tradeoff is that the game difficulty has increased, and hero placement can mean the difference in an enemy slipping through.  Furthermore, while the base towers remain the same, there are entirely new tower upgrades to play with.  The later levels require you to strategically mix and match your towers in order to effectively deal with varying enemy types.  The game punishes you for spamming one type of tower."

If you've finished KR Classic, and you feel like you could use another 21 levels of it, then this game has what you're looking for.There are eight new towers, but they replace the eight original towers, so although they're fun to unlock and use, you don't have more towers overall. There are new enemies, but half of them are just reskins of the classics, so only the latter zones really feel noticeably different. Apparently there's also a small improvement to graphics, but I didn't notice.The only obvious difference, to me, was the introduction of the leveling mechanic for your heroes. This time, they start off at a lower level, and you have to grind them up to lvl 10, and choose which powers to upgrade along the way. Since they all end up the same at lvl 10, however, your individual choices don't really matter in the long run; just grind your favorites to 10, so you can use them on the hard stages.Like I said, though... I didn't want anything different, and I don't suspect that you do either. I loved the last game, I wanted more of it, and that is exactly what KR Frontiers delivered. The only complaint I have (without spoilers) is the final boss. I feel like he broke one of the unspoken rules of Tower Defense games, and I did not enjoy fighting him at all."

I only wish the encyclopedia was more useful.Kingdom Rush: Frontiers, is a decent followup to Kingdom Rush, with the same (fun and tense) gameplay, decent balance between different tower types, a dozen or so new heroes, and an average sized campaign supplemented with a fair number of mini-campaigns.Unfortunately, the KRF port on steam comes only with the base campaign and about half the heroes. The rest are ""coming soon"" (concrete dates noted in a post by the devloper below). At the moment, I would not recommend buying the game."

The artwork of the game still remains the bright cartoonish style but with more details, sound effects brings back the felling of KR it self, and also the amount of easter eggs in the levels surprised me, you will never know what will hapen when you click on something. What a great game!"

Heck, I could get my Texas instruments calculator to run this if I got bored. A simple flash browser game that got big and ported to every OS ever... That sums up the game on a technical perspective. It runs great, although not important in this genre, it pulls 18 frames more then windows on same hardware even.Easy 1 button install, easy 1 button play. As good, if not better then, native Windows.Cheers to devs."

But for this Steam version, it lags horrendously sometimes, I have restarted my computer, defragmented my disk, and closed out everything else besides Steam and the game, but it doesn't fix the lag. It's literally unplayable when it lags, but when it doesn't, it's an excellent game."

It is a mobile port, but it is well done and worth the $10 price. On a related note, the third game in the franchise is also coming to PC and I can’t wait. It is a great game series and fun to play."

Probably the best TD game on steam along with the Orcs Must Die. At first it was very challenging, but the game is obviously much easier with Boneheart. If I had any compliant it's that the heroes aren't well balanced at all. Most are duds."

(so far!)A great game to play while listening to a podcast or just some tunes.Tons of levels and heros to play and unlike the free versions all them are unlocked through playing the game instead of more cash. Also ditched the lvl every game system Kingdom Rush used, so now the grind counts towards something instead of just being reset every game, Only thing I could think to add is a zoom function so I can see the backgounds and towers up close but thats about it.tldr: 9/10 a great tower defense."
76561198138939394,Recommended,458710,34699687,Posted: 2 September,all,Insert Name Here,"Man, do i LOVE this game.I recommend buying this game all the way, and for some major reasons.1. The game is quite long, and has some good replayability, making it the perfect time waster2. As this is the steam version, you can get all the heroes completley free instead of paying for most of them on the IOS/Flash versions3. This game and the original Kingdom Rush have the same price, 10$, and they occasinally go on sale from time to time, so if you see a sale, dont miss dat chance.4. The amount of enemies this game has is quite impressive, almost every stage has a new enemy appearing atleast somewhere, some more rare then others, and, although it has less bosses then the original Kingdom Rush, they are still a challenge to fight and will keep you on your toes.So, theres the good things, but there is one flaw in this game that may not be that big of a issue to some, but it kinda is to meThe difficulty is quite hard, even on Casual mode, but atleast its not as hard as Normal or Veteran mode, those are almost impossible to do without lossing a hefty amount of lives.But, overall, i recommend this game to anyone looking for a great tower defense game, this is truley the best you can get."
