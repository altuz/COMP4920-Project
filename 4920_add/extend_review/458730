,Recommended,458730,25006619,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,raximkoron,"I originally completed this game on my PS Vita, as it was initially released for the Vita and 3DS.I'll be frank about it, the dungeon crawling mechanics and battle system are not going to blow your socks off. At some point early on, you can make a combination of star children that have the move ""Killing Field"" and there's no point in deviating further than that combination throughout the entire game as it's significantly OP.The dungeon crawling is very reminiscent of the Persona series, with randomly generated levels that you wander around in a 3rd person view.The battle system is kind of interesting, having 4 positions around an enemy you can move to which helps mitigate and/or cause increased damage. Overall though, it's very simplistic which isn't a terrible thing as it's a JRPG, so grinding for levels is required at certain points.Where the game shines in my opinion, is in the character writing; something that Spike Chunsoft games in general possess. Outside of dungeon crawling, there are dating sim elements with several female classmates. These dating sim elements are more like the Persona series, where making the right choices will further along that character's storyline narrative, not necessarily furthering a romantic relationship.Most of these characters storyline narratives are much more interesting and compelling than the throwaway main story and was what kept me playing the game once I finished the main story. That and the English voice acting (as sparse as it is) is quite decent.Overall, it's a dating sim game with the husk of a dungeon crawler RPG placed around it, dusted in innuendo and humor. It's a good time to be sure, but maybe not for someone specifically looking for all of their games to be innovative."

Conception II starts with an interesting story, an engaging turn-based combat system and Star Children (enough said), but is often bogged down by its awkward dialogue and dull characters. If you can find it in your heart to forgive and forget some of these things, there is an RPG under it all worth playing, even if it's definitely not the best thing we have seen out of Atlus.Final Verdict 3.5/5Final Note:The concept for Conception II is definitely interesting, and I can see this is aimed at a certain segment of gamer. But even a niche title needs to hold the attention of it’s player. Unfortunately the lack of variety in the dungeons and the lack of real choices in the dating sim bog the game down and turn it into more of a chore than a fun RPG experience."

The dungeons have a certain number of floors and you just have to find your way to the end. I was alright with this and found another way to get addicted. The best part about this game is making infinite babies with your many potential waifus. Best part is that they're alright with it if it's for the sake of saving the world. Big Plus for that! The classmating system is great as it improves and benefits you as you play through the game. The main point of this certain game is it's dating simulation. The partners you can choose from have a variety of personality and theres no ""best"" one when it comes to dungeons. It really does depend on who you choose so go for it. You could even choose all of them, no big deal!So I don't recommend it for it's rpg aspects, but for it's dating simulation it's a nice buy especially when it's 20$ with the dlc, dual audio, and mini ost (CONGRATULATIONS OF YOUR NEW ARRIVAL)."

A great blend and mixture of visual novel, dungeon diving, dating sim and making all the star babies you can possibly dream of. Adorable little things, seems they keep their mothers hair color. you can release them to independance and level the city getting more buildings better items etc.Dungeons, quests and so on may seem repetitive, but honestly what in life isn't? It's more a matter of what repetions are fun and enjoyable.The dungeons are a bit lackluster: sqaure/hallway repeat, but considering this is a port from psp or vita and 3ds or whatever I didnt go in expecting killer graphics and so on.This is up there with Aegis Earth on my favorite Steam titles at the moment. A steal of a deal at under 20 dollars, please keep bringing awesome ports like this to us!Few games mix VN and RPG's well, but this one (personal opinion) is perfectly executed. No time limit to detract from either side of playstyle, not overly heavy on VN to kill your RPGing, right up there with Sakura Dungeon, albeit it was a more....naughty title ;) (I got the uncensored version)On a side note I always wonder as I bid my star children farewell tears welling in my eyes, will they end up flipping burgers at Wc Donalds? Or truly make a mark and create a full on corrupt congress and bring capitalism bringing a much, much more dreadful fate; far worse than the monster and ruin invasion! Neptune and friends are chewing their nails in nervous anticipation from Gamindustri!Lame jokes aside, if you like anime, get- if you like visual novels, get- if you like turn based RPG's, get!

,Recommended,458730,29614988,Posted: 31 January,all,Novaire,"Conception II: Children of the Seven Stars is a Japanese role-playing game, developed by Spike Chunsoft, released in April of 2014 for PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS. The Vita version was later ported to Windows via Steam, and released on August 16, 2016. It is not connected to the previous game in the series beyond gameplay mechanics and can be jumped into without any prior knowledge.Livin' On A Prayer​The story of Conception II manages to be very concise during gameplay, whilst sounding incredibly convoluted outside of that context, so keep that in mind during this section. Human society is under constant duress as a result of monster attacks. These creatures emerge from areas of the world called Dusk Circles, mysterious dungeon formations that secrete dark energy. Prior to the start of the game's events, humans have been unable to venture into these areas, as they simply didn't have the ability to survive within them.Humanity is not without its defenses, however. You see, the world is protected by the blessing of the Star God, which imbues select members of the world's youth with star energy. Teenagers who possess the mark of the Star God on their hand, a side effect of the blessing, are forcibly gathered at academies located near the Dusk Circles in order to contain the problem. Here we venture firmly into the territory in which Conception comes into it's own. With this holy energy, a pair of male and female students are able to undergo a ritual which has a chance to produce Star Children, a chibi race of fighters capable of providing a great boost to mankind's defensive. That process is called Classmating.Yes, the name of the core gameplay facilitating mechanic is a ridiculous pun, and the game continues to embody a similar level of silliness from here on out. Still, let's take a step back for a moment and take a look at the character who will make the largest impact in the game's story. Our hero is a young man named Wake Archus, who has only just arrived at such a school, just in time to thwart the attack of a creature which had escaped the defensive boundaries, rescuing two of his future friends in the process. Soon thereafter, by way of the routine testing, Wake is discovered to be God's Gift, a student with an immense amount Star Energy, making him capable of not only consistently producing offspring, but exploring what had been previously unknown territory, the innards of the Dusk Circles.​Born To Be My Baby​​Separate to dungeon exploration is the heart of the game, which resembles a visual novel in structure. Wake's movements take the form of a list where the player chooses a location or a character to visit, which allows the purchasing of items and the progression of relationships. The most important of these characters are the nine female students, which play into the Classmating mechanic. The heroines become available for Classmating relatively soon after their introduction into the story, leading to a rather uncomfortable exchanges and subsequent cutscenes. The strength of each's bond with Wake is indicative of the strength that the Star Child is capable of, raising it's potential skills and level caps. Some heroines are more capable of creating particular classes than others, of which there are as many as thirty-seven separate classes, leading to a large variance of potential party members.These characters are really the soul of the game, as they each stand out in the limited context of the game. Each is uniquely designed, and well differentiated in terms of personality. It's genuinely entertaining to hear what each of them has to say as the relationships progress. Your interactions are only limited at certain points of the game, and these are lifted rather quickly as we continue to finish Dusk Circles, allowing him to become closer with his potential mates, each of which was given a character specific ending.​I'll Be There For You​​Separate to dungeon exploration is the heart of the game, which resembles a visual novel in structure. Wake's movements take the form of a list where the player chooses a location or character to visit, allowing him to interact with his fellow students and further his bond with them. Only those formed with the heroines can be truly increased, and they're used as indicators of the strength and level potential of which the mother's Star Children are capable of. As many as thirty-seven different classes are available, with some being more easily attained based on the chosen lady, leading to a staggering variety of possible party combinations.These characters and your interactions with them are the most interesting part of Conception. An effort is made to see that all of them stand out in the admittedly limited context of the game. Each are uniquely designed, and well differentiated in terms of personality, and it's genuinely entertaining to hear what they have to say as their relationships progress. Your interactions with them are limited at certain points of the game, but these are gradually lifted as we continue to explore the Dusk Circles.​Bed Of Roses​​It's not always a great experience. One of the more annoying traits is the lack of any form of time constraint on interactions, and honestly, the developers really should've included some. Whilst it isn't advised, you could forego interacting with the female students until the game's conclusion and still manage to finish out every characters relationship arc without having to go so far as to step into a dungeon. This lessens potential attachment to characters that you might've chosen to spend time with of your own accord.I found the dungeoneering gameplay to be lacking, as it was simply not engaging enough to keep me invested. The game contains no additional difficulty settings, and as it sits, is on the easy side with minimal grinding necessary to see it to the finish. Beyond the initial play, I doubt the relationships would provide much in the way of value for subsequent plays, as they really don't contain any branching paths, meaning you'd be experiencing a very similar story, regardless of your dialogue choices. Perhaps the lack of a limiter is a blessing in disguise, as the game really doesn't have any replay value to speak of. It provides you with a save point after the final battle so that you can choose a different girl and experience their ending without forcing you to replay an entire section of the game to do so, an appreciated gesture for my money.Conception II is far from perfect, and its thorns cut deep by the time the credits roll, but it does provide some charm in it's own ludicrosity. Aesthetically the game is very easy on the eyes, and it game has plenty of fun with the concept's inherent quirkiness. It comes mildly recommended for fans of visual novels and folks who enjoy relationship-values as a game mechanic, but the gameplay may not hold the interest of veteran role-playing fans for long. Have a nice day.Time Spent: 60 hours.Further Playing: Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 (PlayStation 2, PS Vita), Fire Emblem: Awakening (Nintendo 3DS)"

You will quit once it starts getting labyrinth heavy and you realize you have to grind for a few hours to keep up.If you are familiar with some of those games, and you enjoy them, then you will enjoy this.  Yes, level grinding gets dull after awhile, but there are enemies you can chain and other things to make it better.  The visual-novel aspects are very good imo. I really had a hard time choosing between 4 of the girls for the last choice and usually I stick with one from the beginning. There are not many other things to do other than talk to the girls, create better star children, and go through labyrinths, so it does get a bit tedious for awhile. BUT the story will pick up and get better and you unlock more cutscenes/convos with the girls and your friends.I give this game a 6.5/10.  Not the best of its genre, but still good.  It kept my attention for a few weeks and I will probably play it again in the future."

Humans can fight off these monsters, but only in their world. Enter main character: Apparently, he's such a badass, he can fight in the enemy's world. He can also bring a waifu too! Main character + Waifu of choice needs to go through series of dungeons to save the world. Don't forget the kids!Traditional RPG mechanics at its finest, Conception 2 plays similar to the Persona games in terms of dungeon exploration and enemy encounters. You fight enemies in battle by selecting an attack or skill, and then picking where to attack from: Front, side, rear. Enemies have distinct weak points that when hit, deals extra damage. There's also an elemental attack type system, and a few other minor elements to the game. If you're into traditional RPGs, you may find an interest in the game.As the game's imagery suggests, yes. Conception 2 also has dating sim elements. Between story progression sections, you are given the opportunity to chat with a few of the heroines in a simple visual novel style cutscene. Usually giving you one or a few choice option of words or interactive options. Depending on what you pick, you can improve their mood, or make them hate you more. Their moods will also determine the strength of your children.Oh, did I mention children? YES. CHILDREN. In the game, you are required to visit a proclaimed ""Holy place"" with a heroine of your choice. In this statement, the main characterhas sexual intercourse with the female character and creates ""star children""undergoes a ritual to create non-human beings that fight along side you called the ""Star Children"". The game states however, that this is a ritual, and not what your dirty mind thinks it is. I would like to believe them, but seeing as one of the girls became exhausted after the event, and they're very embarassed by the act...I'm watching you, Conception 2...The PC Port isn't bad, but I'd like to say it's ""Lazy"". The game itself doesn't have any settings to turn on the MSAA. or other important graphical features. Hell, you can't even CHANGE THE RESOLUTION. These settings can however be changed in the ""config.json"" file within the game's installed folder. I suppose it's better to at least have the option than not be able to at all, but still... Is a graphic config menu really that hard to add?There's now a configuration tool.Controller is highly recommended. There's no ""proper"" configuration for using keyboard to type.In the end, Conception 2 on Steam is a solid port. I've had no issues running the actual game, only PC Elitist issues of keyboard + mouse support.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to buy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of this game's steam cards..."

,Recommended,458730,26094403,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,カラクリ,"I haven't beat the game yet but I'm past the halfway point so I say it's fair enough to give a mini review for right now.As everyone already said, the main story for this game is definitely not it's strong point, neither is the repetitive gameplay. So what makes this game worth? The waifus of course.No, seriously. You start off the game with four heroines. By the midway point of the game you will have seven heroines to choose from. Each girl has their own strengths and weakness, so to get the most out of what the game has to offer, you have to work on keeping each girl in a happy mood as much as possible. This is achieved by going through their routes and classmating with them. The routes play as standard visual novel flair, or Persona 3 and 4 for the social link junkies out there.It's fairly simple to answer correctly, although the dialogue doesn't really change regardless of what option you chosen. This can get somewhat confusing as you sometimes won't know that you said the wrong thing until you see their mood lower, as their following dialogue will go as if you've said the right response. It's a minor nitpick, but aside from that, all seven girls and their routes bring much more to the table than the main story ever could.Overall, if you favor character specific plots and their development over the focus of the general story, give this game a try. Even if you don't particular care for the characters, the dialogue in general, considering the type of game and plot this is, has its comical moments. Nothing is sacred. Yaoi, yuri, comparing breast sizes, yandere, tsundere, you name it, they probably referr to any one of these common tropes in Japanese games/anime and more. I recommend it, but if you're on the fence, I'd wait for a sale."

Soundtrack and dungeon traversal are weak imitations of Persona 3/4.

Most heroines are just plain adorable (Serina, Torri, Fionne). However, be aware that the dungeon crawling aspect in this game is not very good.Good:Every thing related to interaction with heroines. Heroines are amazing and their stories are interesting. They're fully animated, and their story dialog is full voiced. This is truly something, I've never seen anything like it.MusicBad:Dungeons. Dungeons are horrible. They're boring, dull, highly repetitive and are designed to be as annoying as possible. Combat has uneven difficulty curve. Most of the game everything is VERY easy and you can auto-battle through anything the game throws at you. However, on a few occasions the game will throw a boss that will mop floor with your team as if it was nothing. Combat is supposed to have a bit of depth in it, but the game almost never puts you in a situation where you'd need to utilize that depth.Level cap on star children. Star children come with level cap, and when they reach the cap, they will no longer levelup. The only option is to make a stronger star child, BUT he'll start at level 1, so getting it back to high level will take some time. It is incredibly annoying.Weird:Main storyline. At some point it takes a very awkward turn that felt a bit rushed for me.I recommend to check this game out because of amazing heroines and their storylines. As for horrible dungeon crawling aspect... since the game comes with dlcs included, just grind ""serious sagitta"", and ignore everything else."

Well typical heroines, that is tsundere, air head...etc..(no yandere ...i think) so well not expect much.3. Only had found 2 costumes (from what i know is swimsuit and normal) but had a lot of accesories that you had to give on dates...they are kinda expensive but is the only thing that worth expend.4. well you kinda make your own party, with ""children"" you make with heorines exist a lot of jobs and leveing them you get more jobs...some are item only...5. not really choices on dates... well you can say...that you have choices but actually all you say had 3 options be good, normal or bad...you will try evade bad ...and that depend of heroine...probably you will select bad for see what will say no more.6. Bad dungeon desing...really if you enter this game for only play dungeons...you are in the wrong place...basicly this game is for see the conversations and select choices with a dungeon mechanics...sadly dungeon mechanics has a lot of flaws. i will start with thebasic...exp/diffictultynot match, basicly for level you will be entering and looking for a creature that lives in last floors of some dungeons, give more exp that hardest creatures in training (by more is 10 times more) with luck some chest will put a mob that gives good exp too. I dont see the point of enter in train dungeons for get exp.7. In the same direction of dugneons is quest.... they ask you get 3 items in mob kill...or kill some creatures...or look for a item in chests...that is normal....but you can only accept 5 of them...1 of them is a semiboss. and if you dont accept quest before kill it (and probably even accepting but well maybe i was wrong) you have to enter training mode for finish. The drop of item is low very low...that is you will only see 3 creatures in all map that had it...and actually they will not drop you, also they not appear in all parts of dungeon. Now if its chest is worst cause is only 1 floor and if you dont get it...you must leave and try again.Conclusion: if you look for a decent story with a side option of dungeon mechanics is the game for you...if you want a dungeon crawler...just keep looking."

Gameplay wise, it's a lot like Persona 3 Portable, but that description doesn't really do it justice. (Mostly because describing games with other games isn't exactly justice.)This port to the PC is for one, cheaper than the console releases. Additionally, if this game goes on sale, you'll be saving more money. You'll be sure to get a bang for your buck with this one, and in terms of the dating sim options, maybe even quite literally.I'm not sure, I haven't actually played too far into the game yet..For another, it's actually really fun, and feels timeless so far. I say that because I'm a grinder, especially when I've not played the game to the end on my own, and don't exactly want to google for the best viable team. Additionally, this game has an elemental system, so getting as many possible characters up to snuff is one of my objectives on covering my bases.The timeless part comes in when you're playing the game and grinding on the same levels in the same types of hallways don't bore you to tears. Maybe it's the fact that there's an autobattle system, maybe for another is that when you encounter an opponent of much lower levels than you are, you can instakill it by walking up to it, not even engaging in combat. Love this feature.The best part about this port is probably just the fact that it's ported to PC. It's somehow less tiresome than having to play on consoles for some reason. So there's that.The, alas, worst part about the port is not being able to keybind. If you've seen people recommending using consoles, that's the reason why. It took me a while to figure out the keys in accordance to the PSVita, but once that learning curve is done and out, the game's quite fun. And if you're playing thje game already and are looking for the keys, here it is within spoilers;WASD is the movement, Arrow keys are Camera. Q/E are the two left/right buttons on the side of the console, while left CTRL is X and Tab is Y. Z and/or Enter is your acceptance button while Backspace is your nope.Should you buy it?Go right ahead. If you've lost time with the Shin Megami Tensei games, you'll find yourself right at home with this game, but go in expecting less. It's much more fun when you keep this is a completely different game that will have a different experience than if you keep comparing it with an already made game.Also, unsurprisingly, tiddy physics."

Dusk circles are labyrinths or in this case randomly generated dungeons as this is a dungeon crawler.The one thing i hate about this game is each dungeon looks pretty much identecal making the game feel very boring the only differences are the coulor schemes pretty much oh and the level grinding ... oh god the level grinding.you are constanly making your children independent which means they can go about the city and do as they wish. Making them independent however does unlock job classes but then the next star child starts out at level 1 making the begining of the game very slow.I will go into classmating (aka sex) you will eventually have 7 heriones at your side each one with different personalities and skills. These girls have spasific equipment you unlock by doing quests and thats the only way to upgrade there equipment.Anyways of subject classmating is where you basically make your star children this game gets really complexed here. depending on the level of the heroine you choose to make the star children with will effect the childs maximum level. The higher level the heroine the higher max level the child will be able to become.I will  not touch on the matter of the censorship because i really don't care.If you like dungeon crawlers then feel free but if you power your way through the game don't expect this to be very long i am on chpater 7 currently and only 14 hours ish in it says i have 30 hours game time but i guessi played it before.I do plan on beating after some ... level grinding.However if you do all of the optional stuff like raising your city to max level which requires the independance of your children then you will most likly get more time out of it because that will also unlock more side quests to do.

I played this game originally on the 3DS and when this game is going to be released on Steam, I was confused, but mostly excited.I played this game for countless of hours not due to the RPG or the battle mechanics, but rather the Visual Novel-esc gameplay with the Female characters. Learning about their backstory, struggles and quirks, it is a pretty interesting ride. However, the battle mechanics is what caused the game to be okay. The battle system does drag as it is repetitive and gets stale fast. It is interesting in concept such as the position of the characters and chaining but battles can be easily be won by using the auto command. I know this is a dungeon crawler type game but the aesthetics of the labyrinth looks unappealing and not that interesting. And yet, I still continue on playing. Because of wanting to know more of the characters and learn how they progress, I continue to slog through the labyrinth just to see what happens next with the characters. I know at points the characters have the personality of your typical anime but I am a sucker for romance and Conception II is no exception.Now to talk about the port. The port is pretty good. 60 fps, better visual graphics and the ability to change the voice between Japanese and English is a nice addition. Also all the DLCs, from what I read, will all be in the Steam edition pre-packed which is nice. Overall the port clearly have some effort put in and not just dump it from the 3DS or Vita version.Overall, I would say Conception II: Children of the Seven Stars is an okay game. If you were to treat this game more of a Visual Novel such as I did, you will have a much better time though be mindful of the repetitive battle system."

As a visual novel it is pretty much your average standard visual novel, but as a RPG it is a bad one.

The story itself is rather simple and nothing too fantastic, just your average action anime.There is a lot of grinding in this game, which can get old pretty quickly if you're looking for excitement, the combat and levels are all randomly generated and apart from being skinned differently throughout the different places you visit.. They are more or less all the same and purely for grinding, it really slows the story down to a halt.Pick it up on a sale, it's not worth it otherwise."

,Recommended,458730,25048451,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,hockeyhacker97,"I own this game on 3DS and its a fairly good game but lets get to wither or not this is a good PC port seeing as if you wanted info on the gameplay mechanics the game has been out since April 2014 there is plenty of gameplay footage and ""let's look at's"" to see if your interested in the mechanics or not. The cutsceens are locked to 60FPS which is prefectly acceptable, and while I have not tried KB&M yet since certain genres I flat out prefer controller while other genres I prefer KB&M, and when your moving in 3D I just prefer analog control over 8way movement, I can say that the controls work just fine. I did have a bug where I had to disable my Xbox controller drivers restart my computer and then reenable them to get the game to stop freaking out in menus but I only had that bug once. And the graphics and cutsceens look like they are a fairly decent resolution and don't just look like graphics blown up from the handheld port.I was skeptical that the port would be good since these devs are the same ones who ported DanganRompa which while definitly not a bad port was not a very good port either, controls just didn't work right, graphics looked like taking a Vita screen and just blowing up the size to a moniter, it was a not so great port of a fairly enjoyable visual novel along the game mechanics of Phoenix Write games which is one of the few Visual Novels that is actually enjoyable to play since there is actual game play and it isn't just a book with pretty pictures.Anyways back on track, the game is enjoyable, if you want details on mechanics and story it came out 2.5 years ago on handheld so there is plenty of gameplay footage, and the PC port seems fairly decent. I hope Spike Chunsoft continue to do good ports of Vita/3DS games, maybe I should go back and try Danganrompa on PC again maybe they patched it to be a better port then when it first came out."

I take back my previous claim that the game is censored. But be sure to think twice before getting this.

Options for your favourite waifu are important for getting good children fighting with you in the dungeon. Story is similar to Conception 1, at least the background of the game. Battle system is improved as you can bring your favourite waifu along with your children when entering the dungeon. Interested to see, you will have your children in the same hair colour as their mother (same to conception 1).To be honest, MOBs are almost the same in every dungeon, boring. I should tell everyone, using automatic mode is stronger than manual operation. Switch on your automic attack mode, so sit back and enjoy your tea^^Good to have conception 2 on steam, game combining visual novel with RPG."

,Recommended,458730,24957903,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,WOOMY,"I shall preface this with saying that I've played the 3DS release of this extensively.That said;This is a good port.   It supports controllers fully, and I've been using my Xbox One controller to play on PC.It runs at a steady 60 FPS, the art scales fairly well, and it's just as fun as I remember it being.I can't remember the price I paid for the 3DS version (I believe it was somewhere in the $40 CAD range), but it was worth it then, and it's even more worth it now, especially given the low price on Steam.I didn't even know that this was coming out on Steam (Shows how much attention I pay to the 'coming soon' tab), but I bought it as soon as I saw it, knowing how nice of a game it was.It's a really fun dating sim/dungeon crawler mix that gives you a lot of options on how you set up your team.Pick your 'heroine' (herein referred to as waifu) and set up teams of up to nine Star Children, whom you create with your waifu in a process cleverly known as classmating.  It's definitely not sex, I think.There are several classes for your Star Children, and your team composition can be made up however you want it to be!  Set a group of three as clerics to do heavy healing, or mix it up and throw in some melee fighters alongside them.Most of the Star Children are pretty cute, and it's fun to see a massive horde of little animu-folk running circles around your ankles as you fight your way through some lovely dungeons.  Fight monsters with strategic maneuvers, attacking from behind to deal bonus damage, or the flanks to build up good combos.I'll go ahead and list the pros and cons as I see them:Pros-Many cute waifu-ladies to talk to, with some pretty touching dialogue between them and the main character-Quite a bit of replayability, with multiple endings and a lot of entertaining dungeon-crawling goodness-Plenty of customizability in your party; your main character, your choice of waifu, and nine little'uns to do your diabolical bidding against your foes!-Fuuko a cute-Narika a cute-Chloe a cute-Feene a cute-Torri a cute-Ellie a cute-Serina a loli, also a cute-Lots of cute Star Children-Lots of items and weapons, and plenty of things to explore.Cons-Main character not a cute, I guess-Not good if you don't like waifus  (but I don't even know if there are people who don't like waifus.  Probably some really terrible people.)The long and short of it is that it's a good game if you're a fan of dungeon crawlers, a good game if you like dating sims, a good game if you like cute animu waifus, and a good game if you like anything at all.I'm just going to say it straight; if you don't like this game you're probably a heretic.10/10."

I really enjoyed it more then I thought I would when I first got it back on the Vita years ago. I got it after completing the Persona and Devil Survivor series. I found this game to be the perfect choice after playing those also. The game at first seemed a little weird, but outside the word "" classmating "" and "" star children "" this game is exactly like P4G. The story is great, I enjoy all the conversations by the girls and guys you meet throughout the game. The battle system/dungeon system is no more worse then anything you would of had to deal with in Persona, and if you've played them through efficently this game is nothing as far as difficulty. You can speed run through dungeons also if you have no problem fighting bosses lower level, the floors are short, and the average amount of floors in this game is nothing compare to Persona 3.I'm really happy to see it come to Steam, since most Steam games like this are just some of that Ecchi/Hentai garbage that gets 10 new games every week. Overall I wanted to play this game a 2nd time and really happy to be playing it again. So far I've find 0 bugs or anything to complain about this port, the price was great too. 20$ marked down to 16, I was expecting it to be 25 and the 20% was it marked down to 20$. If you enjoy making connections and the RPG/Dungeon crawling elements of the Persona series, I feel you will fully enjoy this game and what it has to offer.<3 Serina and Ellie had one of the best stories."

Also, understand that my experience with the game so far is limited. Without further ado:If you liketurn-basedJRPGs and cute anime chicks you'll like this. The official reviews don't lie when they say the dungeon exploration and battles are like recent Persona titles. Back in town you basically spend your time buying equipment and items, and doing ""events"" that'll involve you spending time with friends or flirting with ALL the girls (because why not?)...so yeah basically Persona if Persona were about winning the hearts of your anime harem while trying to save the world--owait it is, isn't it? Although this is arguably more ""anime"" than Persona if that makes sense. The Star Children are not pocket or digital monsters, but they are reminiscent of classes from Disgaea which adds a lot of fun. Disgaea doesn't have the dating sim elements that this game has, and this game doesn't have item dungeons (there is a way to upgrade your equipment but its probably not NEARLY as in-depth) but they're pretty similar in that your time spent in town is just time spent prepping for the next level, i.e. you can revisit previous dungeons, shop around for better equips and more items, or create new units. You can even improve the city for more options (which I haven't discovered yet).If you haven't played the games I mention above, just know this is a fun and colorful JRPG with solid gameplay and a cast of cute characters who are all willing to make babies with you (and yes it does stray into those awkward moments when your parent walks in on you watching anime and it just happens to be THAT ONE SCENE) and if you're uncomfortable* with that kind of thing,don't buy it!Don't make the mistake of buying this if you like only visual novels where you only have to click to advance. This hits the same niche Persona does where it blends VN and RPG elements in a way that works for people who like a bit of VN in their RPG.DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU'RE EXPECTING PORN! I have a very specific category for games like this, which is titled ""Not p0rn"" During classmating your character and the girl become glowing blue and pink slime and hold hands. Shemightbe sitting on you. THAT. IS. IT.*At one point even I became so self-conscious I had to turn it off--hard explaining to your roommate when he hears ""Oh, I'm so embarassed. As a teacher I should take the lead, but I really don't know anything about this. Could you show me?"" But I swear its NOT porn.TL;DRFunny: Be like Randy, be a legend.Serious: Good game for $20. Niche gamers will love it. Rates 7/10 overall, gets the silver medal in the category of ""JRPG with lite VN elements"" where Persona scores gold. Great value at 20% off. Chloe besuto waifu"

,Not Recommended,458730,28896187,Posted: 1 January,all,Xykros,"The initial parts of the game are okay, despite the cringy mechanics (read: classmating) and the weird story that it has. However, the game gets boring over time since this is a grindy game and, obviously, you will need to grind. A LOT. The labyrinths are unforgiving, too, with tons of unnecessary twists and turns.Overall, it should be an okay game, but it just gets boring. If you're a masochist who likes to make him/herherself suffer from monotonous dungeons and grinding, then suit yourself, please do buy this game if you would like to. However, if you're a person who gets bored fast, this game isn't suited for you.In the end, this game would be one of those games that I'll play when I run out of games to play."

When you find out there is a button you can press that makes the game play itself and you are happy to find said button, you know there's something wrong with the game. The game also expects you to do an ungodly amount of grinding. Grinding is fine in an RPG as long as it's fun and for not too long. This game has neither of those. The character design of the girls is also very troupey and boring. The story is also not something to write home about, bla bla bla the world is being destroyed by monsters bla bla bla..."

It does everything this game wants to do but better in basically every way.No, it's not necessarily fair to compare the games because of Age, Money, Tech, etc... but I feel like they tackle a lot of the same concepts so I'll run with it.  The game gets super grindy about halfway through and neither the gameplay or story were solid enough to keep me going through it without cheating like crazy (I learned a lot about CheatEngine, so there's my silver lining).But yeah, you should just play Persona 5.

,Recommended,458730,25765629,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,paralistalon,"My experience is that this is a great dating sim/visual novel wrapped in a painfully mundane JRPG.  They try to tie the two together in a way that the more you level a specific girl in combat and the further you advance her story, the stronger your party characters can become.  You can unlock several dozen different classes that you combine into 3-man teams to create your 3 supporting party characters.  There are tons of options as far as how you combine your characters to unlock unique combo skills, so there is a payoff for your grinding, but unfortunately, the battles themselves are fairly boring and unstrategic.  You can only fight up to three monsters at a time.  You basically have everyone choose their single strongest attack and target the monsters' weak sides, and that's really all you need to do.  They have other complicated systems where you can earn an extra 10% exp. for intentionally fighting poorly and hitting monsters on their strong sides and not killing them, you can spend your precious few BP on a Mech Unite (you'll probably only use this on a tough boss fight), and you can try to match up elemental strengths and weaknesses if you really want, but it's all mostly unnecessary.  The dungeons themselves are procedurally generated (shudders) and as bland as you can imagine a dungeon being.  Again, the saving grace is the story is actually pretty neat, and the characters are mostly likable.  You can also romance all 7 girls at the same time to their highest level, so no need to choose one over the others!  You even get to have ""mind sex"" with each of them as much as you want!"

,Recommended,458730,26553276,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Milo Zyloto,"Pretty alright. Inventive combat system, with a sort of gridded battlefield, where party members' and enemies' position and orientation can effect both damage, and how your limit break/super move meter builds, though normal encounters rarely last long enough for this to really matter. I applaud the lack of characters who conform to the big harem archetypes (I am infinitely thankful for the lack of a real tsundere character, though Serina regresses to it at points), and I even liked a few of them, a rarity for these japanese high school works. That said, the flaws in this game are hardly irrelevant. Every dungeon after the first few is a slog, difficult to finish not because it challenges you, but because you traverse indistinct, undecorated rooms and hallways, with no visual distinction between dungeons except for color and door frames. The story is passable at best, with a bizarre, sudden, and dark turn at the end that feels shoehorned in for the sake of a twist and a conclusive ending, but cutscenes are skippable so it's not a huge deal if it's not to your liking. The party system is fun, and leads to interesting ways to build characters and plan for boss fights, but leads to grinding new members between every dungeon. Overall, the game is enjoyable, and better than a cynic might expect. Even the poorly ported 3ds version could be worth it if don't have a Vita or a half-decent PC, but reluctant customers and those less interested in typical high school setting,and all the tropes they entail may want to wait for a sale."

Especially if you want to unlock some achievements. But I'm sure that thing is normal in RPG games.For me I really do enjoy this game because the story, you will get multiple ending (total 9 endings).And this game have a lot of funny joke too, it really crack me up.Serina (one of heroine) event is most fun to do, her event always give me a big smile especially when she saying the magic wordspetan, pita-pita, petankooooohonestly that make me laughing out loud.I use JP voice, good thing I can listen a bit japanese so I know what they saying. Sometime the translations it a bit off from what they actually said, probably because censorship.Final Score 7/10I will give this game 7/10 score because the story is really enjoyable. Not perfect score, because there are a few thing bothering me when I play it. Overall I really enjoy it and I don't mind to play this game again.I need to find another Visual Novel + JPRG game like this."

Also when you classmate with someone the Starchild becomes level 1 again, I like it that way because the grinding but everyone has a different opinion.I myself am still busy with the story but I will replay it to get the other girls endings my first one will be Fuuko, but Serina is also so amazing it's hard for me to choose between them, but Chloe is kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tho tbh.Would I recommend it to my friends?Yes if they played JRPG's but they don't shooters is the most things my friends playWould I recommend it to random peeps?Depends if the like JRPG with a lot of grinding later on and cutsie anime grillsI would Rate it but I suck at ratings."
