Physics are drastically improved, audio is much better (no more wasp in a matchbox car sounds!!) and graphics are way better too. I'm having an blast playing this.I really disliked WRC5 but this is lightyears ahead of that.ALSO: (updated to include this 14/10) .. the developers are actually patching this one up and fixing stuff. We have had more patches, fixes and improvements in the first month than the previous WRC games had in years.. please keep up the good work, developer peoples! We like being looked after and all of us WRC fans have been treated pretty badly in the past so it is nice to feel like our game is getting some love for a change :) Thank you!BAD BITS:1. It can feel a little slow when you are in the in-car view (I wish the FOV was more adjustable because right now it feels too narrow)2. My biggest problem is that the co-driver just doesn't deliver the calls early enough even on 'Far ahead' setting. My personal preference would be to get them earlier.3. The tape damages the car WAYYyyy too much. Last time I checked, tape does not dent the car this badly. Bit silly, but I can forgive that!4. The bonnet cam seems really high up. It's not a nice position to drive from. Wish it was either lower or there was some way to move it a bit!It picked up my wheel nice (Logitech G27) and the FFB is great. Nice to feel the weight shifting around and tthe grip through the wheel like this and it took very little set up. I started the game and the wheel was detected. I did have to change the button bindings a bit, though, which was a bit of a pain to do. It looks like the UI for bindings is a bit wonky in the launch build (it's too sensitive - you press the button to set the button and it thinks you meant to use that button rather than waiting for another one). Hopefully they can get that fixed in an update?"

It won't be as tough as DR though once I get the settings for my G27, which works fine.There are still some glitches to be worked out I can see already.But overall, the game is pretty immersive, I'm not totally missing the exact replicas of all the courses, the notable features on the tracks are good enough! St. Laurent's downhill hairpins and Fafe's big jump, El Condor is sweet too. But I am loving the 1 to 1 on the SSSs, that is really cool.The Yaris is fun to throw around as well.Anyhow, the last WRC game I had was 4, this is soooo much better and I look forward to doing the career!

,Recommended,458770,26108125,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,KingManWV,"First review I've done, here goes nothing...Firstly, this game is a HUGE improvement on WRC5, although that wouldn't be entirely difficult. As soon as you jump into career mode, you can tell the developers have actually thought about the product they are producing. This is evident in little things such as seeing another driver start the stage before you (and its actually the car ahead of you in the timings, not a random). Another nice touch which I appreciated is the fact stages can be cancelled due to bad weather, an accident or too many spectators on the stage.The handling and FFB feels really rewarding to me. You can really feel when you are driving on snow and ice (steering goes light with lack of grip) and on tarmac (steering is harder as there is lots of grip). The stages are much more realistic as they are longer and narrower with a lot more obstacles to prevent cutting and a lot more spectators lining the stage which really immerses you into the world of rally. In addition, the stages are accurate to that of the real rally. For example, the constant corners in Corsica, the square corners and hairpins in Germany along with fast stretches on narrow roads. WRC 5 was guilty of having constant hairpins on every rally, as if the developers have never seen a rally stage. Thankfully, this isnt the case in WRC6!The damage model is more realistic now as well, although it could be more realistic for my liking. Punctures can occur along stages, forcing you into either struggling to the end or replacing the tire, costing a 30 second time penalty. Again, a nice touch by the developers. The best stages are the super specials which are SO MUCH FUN to drive.The downside of this game for me is how boring career mode can become. Seb Ogier wins almost every single rally, and the AI time appear to be fake as you could lose to your opponent on a super special but still be quickest?! The developers need to look at F1 2016 to spice up their career mode. I like the categories you have to go through on your path to WRC, but once you get there my god it is dreary. Career mode should evolve, like F1 2016's. For example, in 3 years time M-Sport are suddenly very quick and VW arent.Overall, the game looks stunning. Visibility is poor in foggy conditions which is a real challenge. Stages are nice and long and ready to kill you at any moment. Rally fans, it is a must buy. Casual gamers, you could enjoy it. I believe this game could get you interested in the world of rallying.8/10. Sort out the AI!"
,Recommended,458770,29039881,Posted: 5 January,all,Galaxian,"This is a SimCade game leaning more towards arcade though. If you are searching for a simulation rally game then this is not for you, try Dirt Rally or Richard Burns Rally. This game is unplayable with my driving wheel, a DFGT. It is made to be played with a gamepad. I am using a xbx360 gamepad and it plays very nicely.It has a lot of tracks and teams and is enjoyable if you take it lightly and play casually.So, not recommended for Sim Racers. Recommended for simcade or arcade racers. I am going to give a thumbs up because the dev team has done good job with this title and hope they can improve in the future and deliver a simulation racer in the end."

(I am using an Xbox 360 controller)There is a sense of speed and some sense of weight distribution.The engine sounds have improved.The game performs very well at a constant 60fps on the highest graphics setting. (RX 480 Sapphire Nitro 8gb)There are many stages and countries to visit.The bad:Driving over gravel always makes me think the exhaust is dragging on the ground because of the terrible noise it makes.Graphics are not so great, but are decent for what the game is. I think most of us who are interested in this game will probably worry more about the driving aspect than looking at pretty scenery.Nothing looks natural. Not in a graphical sense, but I get the feeling everybody I see in the game is some sort of an early build android robot.The ugly:The pace notes are just awful. After you get past the robotic and comical way they are said and yelled to you while you are driving, you will also learn fairly early into the game that a 3 turn could actually be a 5 or 1. I have taken 3's in 6th gear and other times had to drop to 2nd, pull the e-brake and power out of the outside of the turn to save myself. Just be cautious when he says 3, he's probably lying. Also since pace notes are such an important part of rally, I think the creators should have put more time into making them at least bearable to listen to.Overall this is a good game and very fun to play. I'm going to be playing this one a lot. This is definitely a good addition for rally game fans and those looking for a more official and professional rally experience.By the way ""Left 5.

Gone from WRC 5 are the graphical glitches and sudden FPS drops, as well as the very unrealistic sounds of the cars.It's not ""dirt rally quality"" although it's not trying to be. It's very much focussed at the arcade/casual crowd from consoles, however it does do a very good job for an arcade game. FFB and wheel options are ok with a G27 but it feels much better with a gamepad I've found so far. With more tracks and cars than WRC 5 had, as well as a visual overhaul of the routes you race on and improved car handling physics, it's a decent game I've had fun playing.How much you want to pay for it is up to you, but it's certainly not a game to avoid because of bugs or bad gameplay like previous games in the series."

,Recommended,458770,26092688,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Trulli Train-rekt,"one that keeps me triggered was one of the shallow reasons why this game is having a low rating was simply because it is being kept compared by the community to Codies far superior DiRT Rally(which we cannot deny IS the best rally game atm)...but it DOES NOT mean that this sophomore Kylotonn effort for their official WRC license is a terrible piece of s***, please keep that in mind.WRC 6 is a noticeable improvement over its predecessor, the WRC 5 and the *cough cough* Milestone ones: its been a long time that the typical chain of crap official WRC games FINALLY has garnered such potential with on-par graphics at best, decent physics/mechanics, good sounds, and with its albeit clinical yet straightforward presentation, this reinstates a new hope for this honestly struggling series.sure there are still a lot of disappointing issues that needs some more ironing(bah bind controls and irritating wheel incompatibilities!) but considering theyre starting to churn patches lately, and for the spirit of unadulterated casual rally racing, this game should be treated with simple expectations; give the game a generous chance~a still must-have for those rally artists and some OCD racing game collectors alike, once the price is right, WRC 6 should at least be given some love. this franchise is trying their best to revive themselves from the ashes, to put them back on radar and to be noticed again by the audience. a solid 7/10 attempt that could(and should) be the start~"

No visible controller lag, responsive to minor adjustments, works well.- Stage length:Stages are surprisingly long and complicated.- Damage modeling:You can break just about everything and it has a physical affect on the car.- Licensed:All the licensed rallies, teams, and cars.- Performance:At Very High settings / 1080p / Vsync A, I'm getting a solid 60FPS with no drops and no stuttering.Cons:- Graphics:While they are an improvement over last year's graphics, there's still visible shimmering and the visual fidelity isn't up to par with say AC, F1 2016, Dirt Rally or Forza Horizon 3.- Sound:The sound is mediocre. There's a distinction between the gear whine, engine sound and popoff, but the engines sound pretty weak and there's no real aural difference between cars.- Co-driver:The robotic co-drivers are dated at best. They serve a function, but the Dirt games have done co-drivers better and smoother.- Measurements:(This is the American in me speaking, so metric-using friends, I apologize). There's no way that I've determined to switch from Metric to Imperial measurements (m to ft, kmph to mph, etc).Overall, this is not a bad game, and with the 20% promotional discount is a decent price. It's a marked improvement over WRC 5, and while it's not on par with Dirt Rally, it's very good in its own right. It's a mix of sim and arcade that is approachable and works well as a licensed game. It's also very important to point out Kylotonn is NOT Milestone, and they've done a good job of fixing the problems from last year while introducing some decent improvements."

I wanted to give the WRC titles another shot as I always enjoyed them in the past but I don't feel that right now I can recommend this game. The graphics are still very poor compared to other titles.  I have to admit, even on my system running a GTX 1070 with everything cranked up, it still looked like an old xbox 360 title.  The screenshots posted on the store actually look nothing like the game.  I hate to say it, but it feels like false advertising.I always liked the fact that you start off in the junior leagues in the WRC titles and work your way up but the actual driving physics which should be the most important aspect feels so off.  Yes the cars feel weightier but you cannot justify the snap oversteer/understeer that you feel.Comparing this to Dirt Rally is unfair. Codemasters have been doing this for years and honed it.  Dirt Rally is as close to a simulated rally experience you can get here on Steam, this isn't a simulation at all even though it has a sim handling option.  Treating it as a stand alone racer, I don't find the experience rewarding and although it is better than WRC 5, it still has a long way to go before it is as enjoyable as the original titles.I feel that what is needed is a new focus.  Rather than churning out a new itineration every year, take the time to actually get the car physics right.  I admire the fact that you have 1:1 scale stages but what is the point if you feel like every turn is laboured.  Do what Slightly Mad and Codemasters done and get this into Early Access and let us racers actually make this the game that we all hoped it would be. I was seriously hoping for better and I hope that things get sorted out otherwise I can just see the WRC titles just not existing and us all just going back to Dirt Rally."

At first the team was interactive with the customer and I truly believed the few ""bugs"" would be fixed. Sadly I believe the main""bug"" of rapid frame drops and micro stuttering is not something this team is experienced or cares enough to fix, and it is deal breaker for anyone interested in this game because if anything it has gotten worse just like last years attempt at ""fixing"" it with 2 versions of V-SYNC, neither of which fixes the problem. Yes it does help, but in 2016 and this being their second attempt at this title, they have failed the customer again. So in closing-unless by some miracle they fix this game breaking issue-along with some other ""bugs"" like the pace note calling being rubbish and sounding like some crazy mad man is in the car screaming certain calls usually too late, save your money . I have above the recommended specs for this game and run it on medium and still have the stuttering and frame drops, so its definately not my rig. Have a GTX970 iCore5 6500 16 GB of DDR4 2133MhZ ram, so you be the judge on why it still runs crappy?WRC 6 first off is NOT in the same league as Dirt Rally, but, it really cant be and still be sold to the masses. Rally is a cliche already, and to make it as real and difficult as Dirt would not help sales. I will say that I own all 6 WRC titles and WRC 6 which was made by this same developer is a HUGE improvement over last year. The cars seem to be a little more in touch with the road and the different surfaces. the tracks are quite different than any previous title and vary enough to keep you interested. Now ehn WRC 5 came out last year I purchased it and gave it a recommend, then they tryed to fix it and did more harm than good. This year there doesnt seem to be as many issues as last year except for the V-Sync , screen tearing issue. Not as bad for me as for some others, but, still present and the most dissappointing issue about the title. I have a GTX970 and Windows 10 64 bit, iCore5 6600 and msi Motherboard, 16 GB DDR 4 2133 MhZ,  not the best, but pretty good, and I dont have hardly any FPS drops or screen tearing issues as I have heard some complain of  the game has a lot of different ways to play, hot seat being one of my favorites, and you can start at WRC JR and work your way up in career mode. You can design your own championship with any class and put the rallies in any order or just your favorites. All in all, good FFB and not bad physics if you choose sim mode.  I am very hopeful that the few issues there are will be given the proper attention and be fixed, the main problem being the PACENOTES. They dont come on time even adjusting the timing in menu and sound ridiculous, takes away from the immersiveness of the rally. The FOV and no rear view nor seat adjustments are unconscionable in a new title when they should be included as a no brainer. The rear view is what I think is a big issue mainly when you are playing head to head against someone, and i always like to take a gander back once in a while in the game just to see what i hit and the damage it caused.  In my opinion (and I own all of the modern games RRRE  Dirt Project CARS Assetto Corsa Automobilista) to name a few and enjoy sims more than arcade racers, but, this is good enough to own if you enjoy racing games and want the WRC lisence experience. I would say that if you liked GRID Autosport and its sim-cade experience, than this is as good at least as that."

The physics are better and the tracks are narrower but they are also flat and drifting is easy. The challenge is to keep out of the gullies and avoid the drops. Textures are a bit weak on banking and surface. Like the previous games this supports a limited number of steering wheels. I use the xbox speed wheel, which is supported in the Dirt series of games but not WRC. Saying that there does seem to be more controller adjustment with this game so I can over tweak the sensitivity for it to be used.Not sure about the weather, played one race and it was either fog or rain but came across as just grey screen and a depth of view of about 5 metres.I am disappointed as yet again there are no female drivers which is a total insult to the likes of Louise Cook, Molly Taylor, and Emma Gilmour. Also absent from this game is the WRC3 class which makes vehicles limited.Overall, it is a fun rally game with a large number of tracks to slip and slide around.

Having said that I will start with the positive bits.  The physics are improved over WRC 5, but not as much as people say in their reviews.  I love the special stages, and wish I could import them into Assetto somehow, but that's not the point is it? The game is fun as an arcade game, but in our age of Dirt Rally, Assetto Corsa, and Rfactor 2, no developer has business creating a rally game where you don't need to use the hand brake.  Using it made me slower on the simulation setting, so I just tried turning and braking like in WRC 5 on the same simulation setting and I was able to do a perfect drift each time.Ok, that was the positive part, if you can call it that.  The physics and feedback people talk about is nothing but a constant rattle of the wheel.  My fanatac was just rattling no matter what the terrain was, or how big the bumps were.  This fake feeling of feeback from the tires and road just became annoying after a short time.  This game is not in the same league as Dirt Rally in any area except SS tracks, and for my money nowhere close to Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo either.  What SLRE had going for it was one very simple little thing, the feel of weight transfer of the vehicle when braking.  I believe that they nailed that over any other rally game in history, and i'm sure it's thanks to Loeb, but people trash it cause understandably they were expecting the greatest rally game ever made, because of how great he was.  I won't compare this to RBR.The cartoon like graphics don't bother me so much.  In fact, they make the environment more lively and pretty.  However, what developers need to realize is that those types of graphics make colours bleed into each other, which makes it hard to see the road.  The reason realistic graphics work is because it creates a visual contrast that allows you to look further down the road.I actually feel kind of bad giving this game a bad review, because generally I love racing games, simracing games, and especially rally racing games, and would love to encourage developers to make more of them.  I hope that the develper listens to the community and gives us a proper rally game that feels like a rally game.  If they only fixed the fake ffb (fffb), and fixed the physics so drifts don't feel assisted in simulation mode (so you have to use a handbrake to go faster around hairpins), I would completely recommend it."

There has been definite improvement since last years WRC 5.  Is it on the same simulation level as Dirt Rally no however this being the official WRC game they are aiming to be more accessible.  They have a multitude of difficulty settings which allow you to go from the arcade to simulation which is fairly close to the level of Dirt Rally which I am impressed by.The engine sounds have gotten better and the pace notes are back to what most people know with a 1-6 which is nice.  Handling feels good if at times a bit loose but I have only played the Junior WRC in career where setup changes are not allowed.  The stages also feel more like the real world counterparts this year which is also a huge plus.Downside would be the damage model feels too forgiving but then almost all games are like this.  For example in the video I run into a fence and have next to no damage from the impact.Overall I would recommend this even if you have WRC 5 as they have done a good improvement over last year unlike most yearly releases as long as you know it is a more simcade than simulation.

In snow the brakes appear to do almost nothing and you must have your foot on the brake at all times. The only way to drive effectively is on HOOD cam view, and then you miss the windshield wipers!More notes as of late:-The car always seems to be too slippery on every surface other than tarmac-Snow with studded tires should be incredible grip, yet is as if the tires are bald in the rain on tarmac-Cockpit view is nearly impossible to see out of-Hood cam is too high up10/8/2015: Still loving it!Just a few ideas I had:-more ground cameras-Skoda Fabia R5 has 5 speeds not 6-adjustable seat-remove the tinted upper area of the window, its hard to see through it (some cars have it, not all)-Clutch pedalThis is a really fun game!

Perhaps the biggest endorsement of this game I can offer, is to say that after playing 210 hours of Dirt Rally (the benchmark against which all rally titles will now be measured), I still immediately enjoyed WRC 6. Well, almost immediately - I had to experiment with the wheel settings for about 30 minutes before finding settings I was satisfied with.  It was definitely worth it, as the game quickly went from being mediocre, to very, very good. I'm using a Fanatec CSR Elite and the feedback and feel is excellent.Anyway, let's get on with inevitable Dirt Rally comparison. While the game isn't as visually spectacular as Dirt Rally, the graphics are a marked improvement on previous versions, and generally very pleasing to the eyes.  The game doesn't appear to be too demanding of your hardware either, and will run in 1080p at very high settings on my machine (which has a fairly modest spec sheet by today's standards). I have no complaints about the audio either. Again, probably not quite up to Dirt's standards, but more than adequate nonetheless.The physics? Well, that will really depend on your perspective, but for me, WRC 6 falls short of Dirt Rally in this regard, as the physics simply don't have that realistic simulation feel.  If however, you prefer less challenging, 'arcade' style physics, then you'll likely enjoy the car behaviour in WRC 6 more than Dirt Rally.  I turned the settings to simulation and turned off all assists, and I find the handling to be a good balance between arcade and simulation, and for the most part, challenging enough to be enjoyable.WRC 6 also can't compete with Dirt Rally for variety of content, the latter offering Hill Climb and Rally Cross events in addition to the standard Rally events. These additions are by no means a novelty either, they are brilliantly executed, and keep you coming back for more.  WRC 6 does however offer an esports competition, an officail online WRC if you like, which is a great addition for all of us wannabe WRC drivers.If it's starting to sound like a one-sided fight, and a clear victory for Dirt Rally, well it's not quite that simple. If, like me, you're a WRC fanatic, then WRC 6 trumps Dirt in one key area - official content. You get all 14 rounds of the 2016 championship, all the official drivers, teams, cars etc. which is very appealing for hardcore WRC fans. The stages are fanatstic too.  Rally enthusiasts will be pleased to know that the stages are now properly narrow, and some of those stages are now also seriously long, and will really test your concentration levels.Objectively, WRC 6 falls short of Dirt Rally in almost every way, but it's a game that seems to be greater than the sum of its parts, and for me, is at times even more enjoyable than Codies' recent masterpiece.  Time will tell if WRC 6 has the enduring appeal of Dirt Rally, but at the moment I'm loving it, and can't see myself getting bored of it anytime soon.If you're a rally fan and a keen gamer, do yourself a favour..."

I want variety, I want new and different content. I like racing games, not just 'A' racing game or 'THE' racing game. If you are the same you should have a look at WRC 6, as well as Loeb Rally and all other non-Codemasters racing games.The standout feature for me so far in WRC 6 is the stage designs. While I enjoyed the aggressiveness of the stages in WRC 5 they felt a bit similar after a while. The stages in WRC 6 are completely new and different from WRC 5. They are much more varied and unique.I've not had any technical issues so far, 'true' I had to tweak the settings to get the game to run smoothly, but I've been forced to do that with every racing game I've played for the last 20 years, even the mighty Dirt Rally.

After putting a good chunk of hours into Dirt Rally I wanted to try something different so I bought this on sale.This game gets an undeserved bad rap. In simulation mode the driving is just as hard, and feels very similar to Dirt Rally.You can also crank the AI difficulty up to extreme and you will probably come in last every single race. Or if you're like me, put it on medium and come in first every time which is kinda nice after not doing so well in Dirt.Unlike DR this game has different gameplay options from arcade driving to full simulation.Where this game does lack compared to Dirt Rally is the finishing touches. I use headphones when playing and the sound in the car just doesn't quite sound real. The flying gravel sounds like a recording played on loop that doesn't quite match with what the car is doing. And the co-driver is frankly, awful. His voice clips and he sounds robotic the whole time. Except when you get near the finish and he for some reason yells out ""finish!"" and it's so jarring compared to the rest of robotic delivery.At least he doesn't sound mildly disappointed after a big spin out like the co driver in D:Rally.But this game has an upside compared to DR and that's the career mode. First of all it's real WRC licensing so you get all the cars and drivers and tracks from the 2016 season and there is a real progression not just buying news cars and trying to get into the next racing tier.We all know Dirt Rally is the current king of the rally games but this game is quite fun and worth playing especially when you can get it for 50% off."

So developers: the sound the engine in making IS NOT DEPENDENT ON RPM ALONE. RPM dictates the pitch, but the loudness is given by power, WHICH DOES NOT CHANGE RPMS BY 1000 IN 1S. I drive by sound, but downshifting under braking and then accelerating instantly to the rev limiter is immersion braking.This is the only bad point I carry over from my WRC4 review. Gameplay is good, stages are pretty long, my fanatec wheel is working great, but RPMs are my killers.

It doesn't run as well, the handling and controls are nowhere near as intuitive (maybe ""familiar"", in my case), the graphics suck, the camera angles are horrible and the co-driver's voice and tone is unbearably robotic. Unless you're desperate for official cars and stages from the WRC calendar and/or are a huge fan of rallying and are highly skilled at rally games, I cannot recommend this over any of the DiRT games (except maybe DiRT Showdown :P)."

The fisics of the car is the same on every surface (playing with the more realistic settigns) and you are not able to set up anything! damages are ininfluent on the car or on the engine. Gears are too short ancd you cannot tune them. The car will spinn even in 4th gear! The grafic is quite good but the sound is horrible!Don't waste your money, buy Seb Loeb Rally or Dirt Rally. Now I understand why WRC6 is cheeper than WRC5!!"

Total surprise and instant favorite game. Game physics are so much more improved and graphics are very nice. I play games only in 4K and Ultra setting and this game runs just perfectly around 70 - 80 FPS in 4K. I like car physics, it feels in most of the time very realistic and you can feel car heaviness. Even more realistic than Dirt 4 in my opinion. With Thrustmaster T500RS this game is the blast. I really hope that WRC7 is even better and more improved. Then I say for Dirt Rally goodbye and play only this game :)"

To put it simply, WRC6 doesn't even compare to Dirt Rally.  It just has this arcarde-like feel to it, and no sense of realism.  With the graphics set to max, it still looked ""malnourished.""  I will say that the different stages/locations WRC6 has to offer are nice, where as Dirt Rally has only so many.  WRC6 (and as with most racing games) was designed for a racing wheel, one that I do no have.  So attempting to find a setup for the controller was almost impossible.  This might be the reason why I felt the controls for the game to be ""clunky"" lol but hey, us gamepad players gotta complain about something (Dirt Rally gamepad controls did not have this issue btw).  The overall sounds too were just, meh.  I couldn't get serious, I didn't feel immersed and again, Dirt Rally certainly didn't lack in this area of their department.There are many other reasons why I wouldn't reccommend to purchase this game, but to leave an honest review I'm going to just end it here.  Those are my top pros/cons.  If you're looking at the pictures and starting to get the ""drools"" as I like to call it, please do not let that be your determining factor.  Yes this game is cheap and if I'm not mistaken, there is a special sale going on for it as I'm typing this review.  But if you're willing to spend the $35 for it, might as well keep it in your pocket and put it towards Dirt Rally :)"

Handling, sound and FFB is improved.But if you try Dirt Rally right after a stint of WRC 6, there is still not one element that matches the level of Dirt Rally, in every aspect is WRC 6 still inferior to Dirt Rally. And by a comfortable margin.One thing that could be better in WRC 6 is the fact that its backed by a licence, but that is not something that speaks for the game itself.Lots of problems with controller setup. Using Logitech G920."

Why is it a DLC now?- Bad graphics, WRC 5 looked much better- The Yaris can not be used in a custom season so it is pretty much useless- What does the pace note Left 5 over tunnel mean? Am I supposed to engage the Jetpack?!? I could not find a key for that.- The game forces an annyoing introduction on you on the first start. All I wanted is to drive the Rally Monte Carlo so I had to ALT+F4 out of that and restart to be able to do so.- Some annoying Rabbit on steroids keeps gobbing off in the menu with useless information like that you can start a rally in the rally section (and I though I would find the Rallies in the options menu, good that he was there to ""help"" me.)- The Rallies are a joke. I drove the whole Rally Monte Carlo in 30 minutes. 5 stages no longer than 9 KM. That is like the Shakedown of the real thing.Overall:Just get WRC 5. It is cheaper and better. Or if you like it Hardcore with no mercy and difficulty from hell get Dirt Rally."
,Recommended,458770,29358682,Posted: 19 January,all,Cotivity,"I was not expecting much but for twenty bucks I had to try the only other rally franchise that interested me over the years and am pleased to report that the game is actually good. Sure it doesnt feel as responsive or have as much physics into the driving model as our resident hero: Dirt...BUT it does very well for itself and after a few races I was able to get into that ""rally flow"" (flick left, right...feathering the brake...etc) and THAT is what matters ! I played a demo of this on console a few months back and hated it as it ran poorly but on PC this game handles pretty good with a higher fps and possibly better simulation model.As long as you're not trying to replace Dirt, this racer is a great addition to rally fans libraries.*UPDATE*  This game has some serious controller issues that need to be ironed out BUT with that being said, I have started playing the game using my Logitech Wheel and it's night and day in comparison...It's almost like theres a completely different driving model in-play when using a wheel and I would recommend using this control scheme as opposed to a controller."

It drives me crazy that hitting a tiny shrub on the edge of the road has the same effect as hitting a pallet of bricks (instant stop). I found it unforgiving and difficult. Even after numerous runs on the same track I couldn't place a competative time. Maybe I'm just rubbish at rally games. This being said I was using a keyboard. People with a controller or wheel are likely to have a better time.* EDIT *So i got a ps3 controller to use with it, figured i owed it to my self seeing as it cost $ 71 AUD. Actually plays very well. Really like it now. Definitely needs a controller!"

Gameplay isn´t good either, tracks are un realistic, co-pilot is unsyncronized all the time. It´s just awfull. Absolutely regret buying  it."
