They then release Pool Nation VR just 5 weeks later and i dont think there has been any update or word from the devs since regarding this game.Just take a look in the forums and you will see not only are there no updates, but there is no reply at all from the devs. They are active in the Pool Nation FX and Pool Nation VR forums, but utterly silent on the Snooker Nation Championship forums.I know it is inexpensive, but i wouldnt even pay the £3 they are asking for it. Devs like this deserve no money and no support.From the store page:Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“We're hoping to be in early access for no longer than a year. We will follow the communities lead on when we feel its ready for a full release”11 months so far and not even a single update yet... not one.How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?“We want to schedule set updates, that we can work together towards. Each update will be planned in advance and we will take it one update at a time based on community feedback :)”Sure.... This is an outright lie. Cherry Pop Games are scam artists, plain and simple.

Here's why...I bought Pool Nation FX in its early stages of development because of the addition of a ""Snooker"" game. The developers (Cherry Pop Games) were very keen to turn this into a serious, well-made snooker game and progress was originally good with lots of support from people wanting a great snooker game. CPG decided to take all the suggestions from the PC players and put them into a ""new"" paid-for version of the game called ""Snooker Nation Championship"" which I bought into with hope and excitement. The graphics were great but the old bugs, issues and problems from PNFX were still present along with some new seriously bad sound issues __ so basically a cut and paste job from PNFX to SNC.However since promises of updates the develpment of this game has stalled completely with no feedback from CPG leaving the game unfinished and unplayable.In the meantime CPG have realeased a new virtual pool game, which seems to be successful and are working on a virtual hockey game now too. To add insult to injury they have relased an ""update"" of SNC on the X-box while we, the PC punters are still waiting...So for many months now I have bought into a belief that this snooker game is going to be great while all along playing a half-hearted botched, unenjoyable, bugged game with no real improvent on the PC to date.Cherry Pop Games, to date, simply cannot be trusted."

I simply can't just sit here and watch people spend there hard earnd money(Even though price is not much, but this game is not even worth it as free to play) on this pile of **** from **** devs. Not only is the game FAR from unfinished, bugd, single player has the worst AI ever if you can do a break of 20 or higher you will easely beat the HARDEST AI that barely get a break on 10. But no, that is not enough, on top of that it's getting close to 1year since update to the game, like 4-5months since heard from the devs.So people, just don't buy this game, not even if you think it looks ok as it is and it's cheap. Just dont support devs like this, devs like this is what ruins entire Early Access so just don't support them even if they drop price to 0.001euro.

I hope its not moving the mouse back and forwards quickly..When tight to the cushion the view is obscured by the 'transparent' cue which gets annoying..AI is wierd.. standard difficulty and they are playing cannons at some very strange angles into the middle pockets!It would be good if the AI aim was actually where the ball was going (they can be aiming straight yet the ball comes off at an angle).Graphics are excellent. would prefer to have the keyboard configured to move the camera up and down the table rather than having to push the mouse..most annonying things in the game... mostly sounds are a let down.the floppy people in the snooker hall.. what on earth are they doing?the referee constantly shouting for mobile phones to be turned off or to be quiet and let the players concentrate.. even though no mobile has gone off and there is no noise coming from the crowd...the way they cut off the clapping and oohs and aaahs.. it just stops deadthe referee echo no matter whether you are in a hall /club or Championship table.. its like playing in an empty cave..

The cue ball control is non existant for the player but is spot on for the AI. If you are lucky (and i mean lucky) and you manage to get ahead in a tournament, the AI will make it almost impossible to get any kind of positional shots and you just have to sit back and watch as the AI takes frame after frame.Havent tried multiplayer yet but, going on the AI play so far, even in easy mode its almost impossible to achieve much.Its still a work in progress as i am aware but still, they could have tried to put out a better game.Someone said it was a steal for the price, well, they must have had a word with the effin AI ingame because that steals all the effin shots and frames.Just a quick update, do not use ""force play-on"" on the AI after it has commited a foul as it will place the cue ball in a convienient place therefore negating the unplayable situation it had placed itself in. Also beware of the AI calling Foul"" ""push shot"" on you when the cue ball is near the pack of reds, this is a glitch and will most certainly cost you a lot of points.And finaly, do not be disapointed when playing in the solo player tournaments, the AI is ramped up to pro level when you get into the quater finals, unless you have many hours of gameplay under your belt, its best to avoid these even when in easy mode. The AI does not like to lose thats for sure, 60 points in the lead, no problem, AI calls a foul shot, AI player makes 70+ clearance and clears the table. Who knew the AI could be so professional :-)"
,Recommended,458830,26566350,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Jacobmeister,"Well... this is a pretty tough call. I absolutely love snooker, and any snooker fan will probably love this game too, and considering the price, there's no reason not to buy it if you're into the game. However, I'd struggle to justify the purchase if you're not a fanatic.The physics are great. A game that finally accurately depicts side, yay! I've always loved my masse shots so it's pretty fun to do them on here too. They're very tricky though; no matter what power I set it to, the side kicks in earlier than the guideline shows.. perhaps that needs to be attended to?The AI is good, but needs a little more balance. This is one of the few things that were fixed in the like, two updates this game has gotten, but you still see really low level AI get perfect safety shots when they can't pot a black off its spot. Honestly. I do feel like its priority needs to be looked at to - you'll sometimes see them go for a baulk colour when they can still force something on the blue. Positional play is probably the biggest issue, and I'm sure this is something way harder to fix, and is why the hard AI is REALLY hard. They consistently play like they've already won and are playing exhibition shots. It's ridiculous. If you could improve their positional play, watch a few games, see how snooker pros make their decisions, rework the AI based around that; nigh impossible cut shots are awful to play against when you play a good safety and they get out 9 times out of 10.There have been a couple of bugs, which is fine as the game is in Early Access, but as noted earlier, barely any updates! Not good. Partly unfortunate timing due to the VR hype train and other games and whatnot, so of course this game would get sidelined as it's a bloody snooker game for crying out loud, but a little more love would make this game far more approachable. Valve haven't ditched TF2 after 8-9 years or whatever, and they're still making money off that through constant updates - show some love to the game that needs it most is what I'm saying, really. Back to the bugs though, sometimes pots wouldn't register if they almost don't go in, like it just skips to the next player's turn... sometimes the AI just plows straight into a colour off the break if you've snookered them (like literally, straight into the colour in front of them)... I found a weird one today where I loaded up an old tournament I was still in qualifying for and I was apparently losing 0 frames to 3 when it was a 1 frame game (I don't recall playing these out) and I won a frame and won the game. Pretty funny, but weird.Well, you do kinda get what Cherry Pop say... a full tournament. There really do need to be other, shorter options to make it less of a boring, monstrous challenge. Would be nice to see shorter championships, like the Masters, or the other UK / Europe ones, perhaps. Again, with lack of updates, planned features haven't made it into the game. Rest usage would be very neat, but would only really happen with a realistic shot update, which again, no bueno there. Multiplayer is there, but barely anyone is ever on, and it's pretty much the same system as Pool Nation, which is fine, but ughhhhhh.Overall, Snooker Nation Championship is a decent snooker game. Its main strength is the accurate physics and simply the fact that there's no better game around. A LOT of work needs to be done to bring it out of Early Access, which I don't see Cherry Pop doing as that effort may not be worth it for such a niche game in their eyes. But, and this is more directly to the devs, there is simply no other rival. You hold all the cards. Don't just throw them away, do something; the building blocks are there for an amazing snooker game, work on making it more user-friendly, more unique.Get it if you love snooker, you seriously will not regret. New to snooker? Only if you have the money to burn and can accept the loss of a few dollars."

Its not just a game its life. JK) then I suggest you buy it to kill a few hours. I know there is probably better snooker games with a MUCH larger player base but for the price you really cant go wrong. Rate it 7/10"

Top Marks to the Devs, this is a very easy game to recommend.My hopes for this game would be the addition of a career mode which follows the Pro snooker tour , and who knows maybe even official licensing from the WPBSA & worldsnooker.Pleasant on the eye , easy on the wallet.A quality EA game 10/10."

It`s like being one of the guys playing the tour on Eurosport as I watch the games during easter or some other holiday. You have 3 modes in this game: Local VS, Online VS and singleplayer championship. If you like a chill game of snooker with no shooting and murder you should buy this game, if you don`t know the rules dont worry there is also a practice mode and I forgot there is also a trick shooting mode. So good game :)"

The physics seem spot on with a natural and pleasing ""feel"" to the play. The graphics are gorgeous and it runs very well on my modest hardware.There are some bugs and incomplete features as expected for an EA game but overall the game is in good shape already. For the price, buying this is a no-brainer for any snooker fan (and even for those that aren't)."
