,Recommended,458920,26260337,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,shelleproductions,"As a huge fan of Pierhead Arcade and someone happy with Nvidia Funhouse, there wasn't really a need for Carnival Games VR in my life, right?  Wrong.  Carnival Games VR is a great experience with Golden Arm, Fast Pitch, Ring Toss, Shooting Gallery, Haunted House, Funnel Cake Catch, Quick Basketball Throw, Skee Ball, a challenging Climbing Wall, Down the Stretch horse racing, Balloon Pop Darts and a Dunk Tank.  It takes elements that people have sold in full game experiences and makes them short and fun exercises that can make for a quick demo for friends or have you angling for the top of the leaderboards.I figured I would start out with all of the games readily available but instead, the developers made it a challenge.  To unlock all of the minigames you have to earn tickets in the games starting with Golden Arm and working your way through each of them like a challenge.  You can also use tickets to trade for prizes you can then look at and play with in a separate playroom.I was surprised at the depth of Carnival Games VR, figuring I'd play for 20 minutes, make a video for my YouTube channel and leave.  Instead within the first couple of hours the game was available, I extinguished the remainder of my controller batteries and played for over an hour.Carnival Games VR is not for everyone but it brings a true AAA developer's concept to VR in a fun way that I will definitely share with friends and family.  It's more expensive than my favorite Vive title, Pierhead Arcade, at double the price but it has enough variety that I would encourage picking up both.  Go for Pierhead first though!"
,Recommended,458920,32308378,Posted: 9 June,all,arleas,"Carnival Games VR is a pretty self-explanatory game.  You go to a ""carnival"" and play stuff like the ring toss or knocking over bottles with a baseball.  The difference here is that the games aren't all rigged so you'll lose.  In fact, it's quite the opposite.  The games all seem rigged so that even if you screw up spectactularly, you will still get some tickets.I've only seen a couple of the areas to play in so far, because you need to spend tickets to unlock new stuff.   That's kinda neat since it forces you to play the games for a little before advancing to another, but it's also kinda annoying since each game area uses its own set of tickets.  If I go to do the shooting gallery and earn 25 tickets and then leave that area to go to the next area, It will say I've got 0 tickets because I didn't earn them in that zone.I guess that's not that big of a deal since you're only going to unlock a game or two and then a new area, and there's a ton of crappy toys to spend tickets on...but I still kinda found that annoying.Speaking of annoying, there's a carnival barker there in EVERY scene talking in an EXTREMELY exaggerated WAY that YOU will QUICKLY find TIRING!  OH and HE has TO comment ON everything YOU do AND there's NO way TO shut HIM up WITHOUT silencing HIM completely!  He doesn't even sound like the stereotypical barker either.Example: I go to play the ring toss.  I throw one ring and he says ""this DOESN'T look LIKE your GAME!"" and then I throw another ring and it lands on the highest scoring point value and he says ""i LOVE to SEE a MASTER at WORK!"".  They should definitely tone this guy down a bit.  I could understand him saying I suck if I screwed up multiple times in a row, and I could understand him saying I was a master if I was doing extremely well over the course of the game, but it seems like he can go from ""YOU SUCK"" to ""YOU'RE AWESOME"" in no time at all.Another annoying thing (and it could just be the way things are set up for me) is that the game puts stuff just out of reach, and when I reach for it or move to grab it, the whole screen goes black and it tells me to recenter my play space. It's not really well made for Room scale, and the standing playspace it uses is really kinda small.  Is this game aimed at Rift users?Graphics are decent, the areas are colorful, and there does seem to be a slightly cartoony carnival vibe to the whole place.  Everything is well polished and it looks fun enough, but as far as I know, the game is played solo, so you'll just be going for your own personal high score and any friends who happen to have it will also show on a leaderboard.Pros:Nice graphicsThere's some fun games to playIt's not too difficult or rigged so you'll failYou can win some silly stuffed animal toys and there's an area for you to play with them in.Cons:The Barker is annoyingThe aiming scheme with your controllers on the Vive is awkwardSome of the toys don't even seem to work properlyIt's single-player where having a friend play side-by-side would have been great.Looking at the store page it says it supports the Vive only, and Room scale, so maybe there's an option somewhere that's missing.  I know it's set for room scale in VR because in virtually every other game I can move around the room easily.  It still doesn't explain the awkward way you have to select items.Overall this is still a fun game, and it's worth playing, but don't buy it expecting multiplayer, and you might want to turn the volume on that Barker guy way down."

I don't want to tell you how to spend your money. Nor do I want to set you up for disappointment, because it is a short mini game. But one second you're tossing balls at milk bottles and thinking, yeah this alright.  Then you switch to climbing wall.  HOLY CRAP. You're sweating your balls off climbing around an obstacle course of doom.  Its intense.Overall, Carnival games is polished and to the point. Its a collection of mini games that lend itself to VR very well. I say you already blew all this damn money on a vive, what's twenty more dollars?"

Usually I play the VR with many people over and we take turns, so having one game with many different gametypes involved is a plus, rather than constantly launching new games. Game runs very well and is set up in a believable carnival setting, Games are relatively easy to pick up on, yet challenging enough to leave the user wanting to continually better their final score. Kudos as well for having an unlock system that encourages the users to try every game. Definitely recommend!"

They mix really well and make the games very enjoyable.  The experience overall is pretty good, and I can see myself playing this for a short time here and there when i'm playing with VR.There are a few lessons I learned that won't spoil any gameplay, but for me I kept forgetting this was a game, and actually reaching down to grab things.  Finally after 20 minutes of frustration with the warning message popping up, I figured out I could just click the trigger to grab the next ball or item.  That works for most games, and made things more enjoyable.For me all that matters is I enjoyed the game, found it worth the $20, and I think my family will enjoy playing this.  It makes for I think a fun simple VR experience."

I have been a ""gamer"" my whole life, whereas my wife has never really gotten into video games. We also have numerous family members, young and old, who play games with us.  When we got the HTC Vive, one of the first things we did was look for a good ""family"" game.  I'm so glad we happened upon Carnival Games VR.  There is such a wide variety of games in it and it is fun for the whole family, regardles of ability level.  From the ""funnel cake stack"" to the ""haunted house"" all of the games are fun and exciting. We will play round after round of every game trying to beat our own high score and get three stars.  The only game that has not been a favorite has been the obstacle course. It wants you to beat the whole thing in less than a minute (I forget the actual time) but we have not figured this out yet. It seems to take multiple minutes to even get part of the way through it. I'm sure we'll play that one some more and eventually figure it out.TL: DRI would strongly suggest this game for any person who is looking for an exciting, immersive, family friendly game.  Get a group of friends/family together and try to beat each others scores!"

The previous games on the Wii and Kinect were shovelware, and there's a lot of negative opinions on this game because of that, but this game is a marked improvement.There's certainly some bugs in a few of the games, but most of the games are bug free, and play excellently.To be honest, it's a bit overpriced, and would probably work better as a $10 game, but I can understand the higher price of development, and it's still plenty fun.But all-in-all, it's a solid and enjoyable game, and I would recommend it to most."

76561198075749547,Recommended,458920,32623798,Posted: 21 June,all,Get Revved,"Pros:-Good graphics with a cartoony feel to the Carnival, which is fine.-Fun mini games to play, most of which you would find at a carnival, quite a variety which is great-Ticket system works well with encouragement to play things more to get tickets and unlock areas. Not too easy, but not too difficult either.-Leaderboard for high scoresCons:- ROOMSCALE! It really feels like this game wasn't designed for roomscale at all. Before you get anywhere near your boundary the screen goes black and it tells you to move back into the centre. Having the objects tractor beam to your hand emphasises not being designed for roomscale also. I automatically try to reach and pick things up and it really feels like it doesn't want me to do this at all. VR is all about interaction and immersion, this ruins both. It feels like it could have been developed for roomscale so much better, which is a shame.- Aiming/pointing just feels unnatural and awkward to use, could have been done so much better- I don't understand the toy area for 'playing with the toys' seems a bit pointless- The guy shouting things at you can get annoying quickly. Repeats the same things over and over and when you have to play the same games multiple times to get tickets, this can become annoying very quickly.-Leaderboards could have been done better. Global top 10 list with it showing what your global rank is for each game would have been nice.-The Haunted House ride should keep facing forward like it does in real life. I sat on a chair to simulate being in the ride car and it kept making me twist to one side to see forward again which just felt wrong and bugged me. Also this ride is a bit short, more variety, tracks going in different directions on each attempt, dark areas with jump scares etc would have made it more interesting.I got this at 50% off sale and I'm glad I did. I would have felt I paid too much if I'd have bought it at full price.This is a fun set of mini games with a bright, colourful, musical atmosphere. It will be great for demoing to people but some of the VR specific cons I've highlighted ruin the game a bit for me which is a shame. I'd still recommend picking this up in the sale though, it's worth having in your library."

Even after reaching out to 2K games, no respose. It would be such an easy thing for them to put the Rift compatable version here but no luck.

It is a port of an older title, with VR Support, but lacks any way to move in the game or touch menus, instead you wave your hand in a specific, unnatural, slow movement to highlight menus far away from you, sometimes on the other side of the game world.  There is loading screens when choosing games, instead of just walking up to a game you want to play! That is ridiculous in a VR game, when I can see where the carnival game I want to play is but I can't just walk or teleport to it, instead it has to black out the entire screen and then load! Too much of a hassle to explain all the little annoyances to a kid who would like to just jump into a game and have fun, in a natural way, which is what VR gameplay is best as simulating. I bought it at half off but even then it is not worth the price.  Instead, I would encourage everyone to play Pierhead Arcade, which I was surprisingly engrossed with for over half and hour my first play through and ended up being the experience that I was looking for in this game."

There's a lot of games to choose from and the physics feel great! The basketball one is heavily assisted but I still had fun. My only complaint is that the Haunted House ride doesn't lock your camera to the seat of the ride so every time you go around a turn you must reposition yourself. I understand that you probably designed it this way to prevent motion sickness but it makes sitting down for it not work very well. Also I wish the Haunted House one was longer :D Would be cool if there were a couple more ride type things you could go on as well. Wonderfull job Cat Daddy and 2K! I'm very impressed with the quality you brought out in this one. I'd actually pay for DLC for this if that was ever a thing.

Some might find it very grindy or boring but for me it was easily worth the ticket price.The only downside I really have is that you can see a lot of rides / things in the background and you can't really go on them. I suppose it's the fair mini games but I was kind of hoping for the whole carnival experience.Well worth the money, no lines and the games work.If you hate VR mini games or are just sick of them look elsewhere but if you want a collection of decent games this is for you.--------------------Make up your own mind.DanielJMWaters."

Store page specifically lists Vive support. Hoping to see/hear something about dev's looking into this or i'll be requesting a refund. The game does not function. (all other VR games/apps i have still work fine for me)"

My only complaint is the UI for choosing different mini games is a little wonky. You have to hold the controller up at an odd angle to be able to select them.

,Not Recommended,458920,33483203,Posted: 12 July,all,Dom The Musky Skunk,It's not that bad. but in my opinion definitely not worth the price. The minigames are more or less all the same and get boring real quick. Maybe it's worth getting this during a sale but I wouldn't pay the full price again.

(If you have neither, I suggest getting the vive,  the price went down $200 to stay cometitively priced with the Rift so there's not much excuse not to buy it.)"
,Recommended,458920,34693267,Posted: 2 September,all,Kompressor,"Rift Owners Beware.Unfortunately this game doesn't run well for Oculus Rift even though this same titled game is available from the Oculus store.  Two vastly different versions for two different Ecosystems which currently makes it impossible to have all of your games and experiences in one or the other, with my choice leaning towards SteamVR.     This is a Vive only supported version.   Although it will run with Rift at the beginning,  there are major crashing issues which make the game unplayable.Luckily this game was eventually offered for $4.99 sale from the Oculus store and runs flawlessly for Rift,  not having the issues mentioned before with the steam version.   The canival style games are simplistic for sure,  but a great way to satisfy your middle-of-the-night skeeball fix.I only wish 2k would unify both versions across both platforms"
