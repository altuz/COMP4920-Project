It lasts about 30 minutes which seems short when you read it, but its ""almost"" too long for all of its scares. The sound is great and the ride portion is a wet dream for theme park lovers.  This will be my go to horror showcase for the vive.  A must buy experience if you have the nerve."

Maybe even cry.There aren't any video options but it's silky smooth on my 980.

Put first timers on here, who cares.  Just catch them when they fall over.  (walking is slow so it's not so bad)I thought I could play it seated, NOPE, it's a standing experience.UPDATE:  Installed the game onto my SSD hard drive.

Some might complain about the game's length (I pushed through in about 90 minutes) but there are collectibles and you can replay the game and try for zero deaths.  It's also great to watch your friends jump in terror the first time and that **** is always priceless.Be sure to check out the ""Miniature Railroad"" for a nightmarish kiddie-train ride.Well worth the money."

Not completely unhappy as I've had some great experiences, but having seen the constant release of sub par or downright crap releases I've started to not even bother tryng most things.I saw this after playing a similar title on my cousins Playstation VR and thought I'd give it a go. Am I glad I did so - YES I AM - it's actually nothing like the Playstation title, it just has the same premise. This experience took me right back to first time trying my Vive, that feeling of complete awe being engrossed in a VR world. From start to finish this experience was utterly brilliant! I'm usually not good with moving in VR without the teleport sytem, and although this title doesn't have it I didn't have a problem moving through the levels. Even in the fast moving parts I was to busy shouting f*ck that to be concerned about throwing up everywhere.Shooting sometimes felt a little off, hard to describe really, but it just didn't feel I'd hit some of the targets, even though they responded to being hit. However thats just a little niggle in what was otherwise a fantastic experience. To the developers, you have given me renewed hope that VR can, and will be a great a platform for the future. To anybody who hasn't tried this yet, I recommend you buy this immediately. In my humble opinion it'll be like putting on your Vive for the first time all over again."

In fact, I loved the locomotion. I'm a fan of arm swinging but it gets tiring. You have two items, a flashlight and a six shooter. The trigger on the flashlight moves you forward in that direction. It took some time to get used to, but it's the easiest locomotion I've tried so far. The gun has six shots each time you pull back the hammer, so while not realistic it was easy to reload in a pinch. And you will be pinched. I did experience some motion sickness in the mine ride portion, but I didn't really care, it was like a roller coaster. You will be on foot at some point, and the locomotion worked great. I'm not going to say anything else, you should really give this a go if you're into shooters, coasters and/or horror games. If you scare easy though, you may not enjoy this. I very much did.I have three criticisms for the developers. One, the loading is immersion breaking. There are never any points where you feel like there should be a loading point.Second, I mentioned you're doing what you're doing non stop. I would REALLY like a way to save my game and come back to it later. It took me almost an hour and I had no choice but to keep going.Third, because there's no saving, the dying and then still being in the game was confusing. Yes it was kind of cool like how Silent Hill screws with your head....but I'd rather die and then pick up where I left off.All in all, I hope to see more (from the devs) and would like other developers to use this locomotion and reloading scheme. Thanks!"

The graphics really make you feel like you are in an old mineshaft.Length vs Cost: 730-35 minutes - While most of the game is on rails there are parts where you can walk and explore.  For $8.99 you can't go wrong.Entertainment: 7While I am immune to jump scares; most people will jump and scream many times.  The overall atmosphere and sound really give a full immersive experience.Gameplay: 4This is where I think this ""game"" is more of an ""experience"".  There isn't much ""game"" to it.  You have a gun and a flashlight.  While you can shoot things in the shooting gallery, there are no scores or objectives.  The Mine Ride part of the game doesn't seem like much either.  At the end it said that I died 4 times, but I really don't recall any ""dying"" in the game.  There was one time when I triggered a trap, but that was the only obvious part where I ""died"".  I'm guessing that you will make it to the end no matter how many times you ""die"".If you are looking for something to provide a couple jump scares; this is the best I've seen so far.  If you want more of a game, then you'll be disappointed.  Overall this is a great experience, but leaves me wanting more ""gameplay"" aspects."

Great feelings of terror and loneliness.  True to a shooting gallery.Negatives: No real options to configure the second display (too dark on TV's, so others cannot see all the action). Need a map or something or possibly a hit when people get turned around. Continue to develop the story about the protagonist if possible. Sometimes the Spiders will be in the walls and kill you even if you cannot see or kill them yourself (you can hear them scurrying).The down and dirty: I have had several people play this using my VR headset now and everyone loves the game, it feels right and all the way around is just entertaining as heck.

,Recommended,459010,33899663,Posted: 30 July,all,Skirmy_WarGameGeek,"This gets a 3/5 stars, let me explain.I LIKE the game. But, there are two flaws that plague this game for me that ruin it, and I'm hoping the developers read this and update their game.Saw this as a demo at Mid Summer Scream today, it just looked awsome and it was running on a Vive. I asked the guy at the booth would it run on an Oculus and he said yes with 3 sensors (Which I have, ceiling mounted, entire room mapped and guardian system) it would be fine.So, after the horror con, I came home and bought this. Heck, 9 bucks, who can beat that! Then I played it and got frustrated within 2 minutes of the game and here is why.1. You can't rotate your virtual self. -- There is a left thumbstick that is just waiting to be used for something. Right now, it's not used for anything. The only way you can move in this game is point the flashlight where you want to go, and pull the trigger. It'll start walking in that direction. This didn't cause me any discomfort as other walking games do, and I don't believe they need to add teleport. But rotating your virtual self while standing still is a MUST. It's tremendously annoying having to walk to one corner in the room just to get yourself turned around so you can center yourself somewhere else. With 3 sensors there can still be a minor dead spot and it comes back to bite you in this game. I'm seriously hoping the developers can add the ability for the left thumbstick to rotate your virtual self.2. Gun bugs. -- I can't tell you how many times the gun would just ""lock up""... ie it'll just freeze in mid air and not be useable for 20 or so seconds. Then it'll pop back in your hand. This is a huge bug and for a shooting game, where you can't shoot, well, you do the math.So, 3 for effort but they need to add rotating with the thumbstick and fix the gun bugs on Oculus.Note, every other game I have in the rift works completely fine, so, it's not my setup nor my hardware. These issues only affect this title."

Having a mine cart ride through a haunted house, where you don't know what's just some plastic set up to scare you, or a sudden zombie-attack/illusion is great.-The game is well designed in terms of little bugs and errors. It works smoothly and as it should.Cons:-The game goes overkill in terms of scary. For some, this may be great, but for me it made it very boring and predictable. Like every second, you get 'scared'. There is no real building up. The beginning is great. You walk through the dark, not knowing what to expect, but soon enough every second something gets thrown at you. The game would work a lot better if there was some time to build up tension, before it shares the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.-There doesn't really seem to be a way to die. With the accent on ´seem´, because, it turns out, I did die quite a bit. 34 times, in fact. I just had no idea that I had died. I actually was convinced I was unkillable, and tried everything. Shoot myself, move my head in a saw blade, walk through traps. Nothing killed me, seemingly. It also made it feel all very pointless and I couldn´t bother trying to dodge anything.-The game is very, very short. 30 minutes is about all you get from it.-The nausea you experience from this is extremely high. If you're even the slighest susceptible to motion sickness, you will get it.In general: it was a nice thing to have experienced. If it was for free, I'd recommend it, but what you get in return for the 8 euros, is very little."

I also had to close my eyes at several moment during the game because it was just too much (a fast moving downwards spiral in a roller coaster, are you mad?)So unless you really don't get any motion sickness this might give you 15 minutes of fun (yes, it might take 30 minutes to finish, but really, not all 30 minutes are fun).

As you can tell from the video it goes well beyond the touristy shooting gallery and mine ""ride"".There are some serious pros and cons here.Pros:Graphics and art style are great for the low-light environment.  They add to the ambience and ""old"" aesthetic.The movement mechanic is slow and steady to keep people from becoming nauseous.The aim for the gun is very forgiving, especially on the various vermin in the game.Jump scares are kept to a minimum (NOT!) But, that's what I love about this game!VERY spooky later on in the game.  I wasn't expecting the babies... truly creepy.Cons:Fade-out to Vive happens way too frequently (playing on an I7-6800X and GTX-1080 so that shouldn't be happening at all) and breaks the immersion as well as causing some untimely deaths.The inability to switch the pistol from your left hand is ridiculous and should have been addressed at release.If you have ANY movement-induced nausea then you want to avoid this game.  (spoiler alert!) when the mine carts free-fall and are out of control along the tracks toward the end you WILL most likely have some issues.  I had a hard time keeping my balance so I can imagine someone that gets motion sick would have some issues.Many of the jump-scares can be completely missed if you're looking in the wrong direction.Overall a definite good game for horror enthusiasts and well-worth a playthrough.  I wouldn't say it has much in the way of replay value since everything is static, but it's definitely worth watching your friends squirm when they play it!"

The scream for everything is the exact same scream. It was fine at first, but became annoying. Same creepy robo over and over; Same scary miners over and over, all doing the same scream. Shooting does pretty much nothing except clear paths, switches, and causing a scream.

I literally feel as though I just rode a mine ride at Disney. The visuals were excellent, very authentic, creepy, and atmospheric. The only downside is that your stomach may do loops if you are prone to nausea. Make certain you are ALWAYS looking where your walking and following the motion of the mine car. As long as you're always looking forward you should be OK. Also, there are times during the ride when you go from room to room where you get kicked back to Steam while the game loads its data. I'm not sure if this is a problem with this game or Steam in general but it definitely takes away from the immersion. I have a fully loaded top line PC / 980ti and shouldn't have any problems with this type of game. Perhaps the code needs to be optimized to reduce CPU strain when loading data.Other than the nausea and issues with data loading, this experience is highly recommended for those of you with iron stomachs.

Hence that's why the theme park's haunted.  I thought I would get nauseated from having to walk around inside vr because I also get really bad vr motion sickness but what helped me overcome motion sickness while I was out of the mine cart exploring on foot was just by looking in the pointed direction of the flashlight and simultaneous squeezing your motion controller's trigger to move and releasing the trigger intermittently to look around the environment at a stand-still position while letting my brain recompensate for the false sense of inertia.  There are numerous jump scares that startle you right from the beginning and I think this game is perfect to scare the crap out of anyone you have try out your Vive.  Though I wish the game was just a tad bit longer, it does have a satifying ending.  I've come to realize that these Devs at Spectral Illusions can really effectively pull off the horror genre.  What I really would like to see/spend money on are more supernatural/paranormal type shooter horror games by them in the future.  Can't wait to see what's next from these guys!"

This has to be the best 9 dollars I've spent in many years. If anyone is hesitating about this purchase I'd say this is a must try unless you can't deal with motion sickness at all. (I couldn't handle Onward but I managed to finish this game with mild motion sickness)The production value and quality is one of the best among VR games. I wish there were a little more variants in monsters but that may be too much to ask given 8.99 base price.I just wish this game has a shorter version of the ride or some ways to save the game in the middle. The game is pretty long to finish in one sitting esp for those can't deal with motion sickness. I wish to demo this to my friends but one full ride is way too long for a demo.

76561198188697017,Recommended,459010,28211806,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,cockrill,"I just bought a Vive and hooked it up today.  Based upon online review, I bought Ghost Town Mine Ride (GTMR) as one of my first ""experiences.""  And boy, was it!  After trying out Google Earth, The Lab, and The Blue, and being impressed, I thought I would give Ghost Town Mine Ride a quick look.  30 minutes later I put away the Vive and unplugged the Lightboxes with sweaty hands and a rapid beating heart.  And a huge grin on my face!Before getting into the game itself, I will say that I ran into a lot of problems trying to run GTMR.  I kept getting a red ""screen"" in my Vive or, more often, when the game started I would get sound for a second or two and then no more audio.  I didn't have any issues like this with the other beforementioned experiences, so I'm not sure what the problem was.  Finally, after many reboots, audio setting changes (at random), etc., the game worked!  I have no idea how I ""fixed"" it...I don't want to spoil any of the fun, but the experience starts out relatively slowly, and is reminiscent of an amusement park ""lost mine"" ride.  You are in a mine car as it rolls along, can shoot bottles, bat silhoettes, etc.  Pretty tame.  Then the car derails and you proceed the rest of the game on foot.  That's when it gets really exciting!I won't go into any more regarding the gameplay, except to say that you can go as slowly or as quickly as you want.  I went rather slow.  The game mechanics are very natural and intuitive -- flashlight in left hand, six-shooter in the right.  The game's graphics and sound effects are great.  The experience is scary, but I didn't find it so scary that I wouldn't let my 11 year old son try it out.My only criticisms are that, 3 or 4 times during the experience, I briefly saw a ""This is Real"" screen in the Vive.  I see in the game's description that the developer is aware of the issue and is working on it.  Additonally, a few parts of the game were ""jerky,"" but maybe there's an issue with my PC?  I don't have enough Vive experience to really say if the game is at fault or if my PC needs upgraded.  (I suspect the latter, honestly.)  For reference my machine has an i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 16GB RAM, and a Radeon RX 480 GPU.A couple more points...  I didn't even realize that this was a ""game"" until I finished it and read some of the reviews of it here on Steam.  I never ""died"" once...  Maybe that is because I was going so slowly, shooting everything that moved?  Additionally, I'm not sure what the replay value of the game is, but, honestly, it was worth the $10 or so just to play it once.  That's how much I loved it.I am now on the hunt to see if the developer has any other ""experiences"" available or planned."

I did get a little sick with the movement but if you hang in there it will pass.  Mainly because the game is a short one.  However, it definitely feels longer than what the clock says when you are finished.  You can get moving up and down and it really makes your stomach fell like it's in your throat like a real coaster.  Are there parts I didn't care for, sure.  In the end, shooting does almost nothing.  The black tones aren't really black enough so it reminds you that you are in a game.  Not sure the replay value is there.  Is is worth the price?  Maybe not but it's definitely close to that.  What's a couple of extra dollars to support software developers in creating more games.  Bring on more."

,Recommended,459010,33229002,Posted: 4 July,all,Raldman,"This one is a very mixed bag, but it just barely won me over. If it was more expensive, I would give this a definite ""NO"", but the asking price is spot-on. You definitely get what you pay for with this one, and I can't really get upset about that. Here's a summary of my experiance:- Immediate creepy atmosphere at the start screen. Took me some time to man-up and continue (Good first-impression).- Find out that this game uses a walk mechanic instead of teleport (understandable, but caused low-level motion sickness. Won't be an issue for some)- Immediately greeted by animatronic without a faceplate (Little early for that? Seems like it would have been a fun surprise to save for later)- The wooden targets are activated by shooting little red buttons instead of hitting the targets themselves. You have a real gun according to the game, so why shouldn't you be able to just shoot the wood part? I'm sure the button system is a real thing, I just think it makes the game have a little less kick. Seeing wood explode at every hit would feel better (style choice, also not a real issue).- Proceed to mine cart ride. This section was by far the best part. Wished it was the whole game.- Mine cart section ended and had to walk through caves while occasionally shooting stuff. Started to notice that I wanted to walk one direction and aim my gun in another, but the flashlight only points with your navigation hand, and you can really only see where it's pointing a good chunk of the time. I'd recommend the developers attatch it to the gun in future games. Ended up only being able to look exactly where I was walking, so I missed some stuff.- Shooting the animatronics didn't have the kick you'd expect. It just activates their death anim, where they wander around a few steps before ragdolling. Had a cheapening effect, and reminded me I was playing a videogame.- After two or three jump scares, the game just didn't feel scary anymore since every single one felt like it wasn't quite aimed at me (Like I was standing in slightly the wrong spot). They just flailed around and hoped I was in front of them.- Then I started feeling like the game was padded out, and was starting to see the same things repeat more and more, which made me wonder if I had already seen everything.- At some point, an animatronic apparently flung me off a cliff and instead of respawning back in the game area, I just got stuck in the crevasse below (I think I hit the walls a lot and it slowed my momentum enough for me to survive the trip). At first I thought it was possibly part of the game, but the ground had no clear direction, and had much lower quality textures/polycount than the rest of the game. If I really wasn't supposed to be there, I'd recommend making it an instant kill on contact. Either way, I had no desire to continue playing at this point and stopped.This will probably be a game I'll have my friends play up to a certain point, then have them move on to something else. The first chunk wasn't perfect, but was enough fun to be recommendable. Just wish the section after the mine cart wasn't such a drag. I hear it gets crazier at the very end, so I may try it again some time, and will update my review at that point.(Played with HTC Vive on a mostly up-to-par PC. Game seemed to be well optimized)"

Positional audio could use some work--like with the flying axes; can't really tell where they are coming from based on sound.  VISUALS: The darkness helps the scare factor, but it's too dark. There is much happening around me that I hear, but don't see.  More thoughtful stage lighitng to bring attention to specific areas would help.  VR SICKNESS: Full locomotion gives me little or no sickness, but the mine cart is a bit tough on my stomach. It would help if the mine cart didn't jerk so hard on turns.I love the story.

Let's just say that upon finishing the game, I instantly was trying to get my friends to play it too.When buying the game, I thought I would only play it once after reading the description, but I'm actually inclined to play it multiple times now to see if I can get all 40 skulls.I do wish the rock-wall graphics and the water had a higher poly count.

All I know is that I wanted something kinda creepy and this delivered. It became one of the more immersive VR experiences that I have played so far and it exceeded my expectations. For those with motion sickness concerns, you should know that there is NO blink movement in this game its all glide movement and riding in minecarts at varying speeds. HOWEVER, I am moderately affected by VR motion sickness but not once in this game did I feel sick. Not once. Great game especially if it's on sale!"

Camp-y but still scary, particularly in the beginning.Pros:- Good length- The beginning and the end of the game were super uniqueCons:- Some of the ""gags"" became a bit repetitive after a while, making my initial genuine terror downgrade to minor fright."

Since this is my first review of a game I'm not sure exactly what to write but I will give you a very honest opinion. Having 201 games in my account and 57 in VR. I've experienced quite a lot of content and for me compared to everything now available that I know of Ghost Town Mine Ride and Shootin' was a great experience. It's relatively inexpensive and runs very good on my system. I purchased the game 2 weeks ago and today just got around to playing it, I guess I did't read the description very well and was expecting an experience like going into the local sporting good stores and playing the carnaval like airgun shooting game and really nothing more.......... That's were the developers really got me. The title does say mine ride and to be honest I wasn't expecting much to that. Wow! was I wrong about that. Don't want to say anymore to spoil it for others but I thought I was pretty hardened to VR scares and conditioned to not physicaly respond to sudden events. Was I wrong I was ducking and shooting like my life depended on it! You got on my nerves developers in the best possible way. Thanks and yes do buy this game. I'ts worth way more in my opinion if you can handle it. Two thumbs up or should I say 1 flashlight and a 6 shooter way up."
,Recommended,459010,29209769,Posted: 12 January,all,Gunslinger,"I really love this game/experience. First time I played it, I definitely jumped a few times. What i love about it is that stuff actually happens - this isnt a walking simulator with ambient sounds - this is a horror game with dolls, ghosts, zombie miners, bats, and spiders that are constanly jumping, stalking or throwing pick axes at you.Great atmospere here. The whole abandoned Wild West amusement park is creepy as hell, especially with the animontronic miners. Anytime I have people over for VR, I always break Ghost Town out. If you own a Vive, this is an awesome horror/FPS with a rollercoaster/minecart aspect and is definitely worth the price. You can tell a lot of love went into Ghost Town Mine Ride.Cons:-Flickers back to Vive home screen randomly which breaks immersion-Some textures look super muddy-It's a relatively short experience 30-40 mins"

When did that happen?For me the mine car ride made me motion sick so people that get motion sick from vr games will start to feel a little woosieIts short......8.99 to me is a little high for a sub 30 min game.....Butt the quality of the game is very good so I'm not to mad about it.Not a bad game.....not a great one either

This will be a good game to put on if you want to scare your friends and family.I would love for more VR games like this to be created in the future."

Free roam, massive runaway train runs, drops off cliffs Zombies starting the shirt off me, endless jump scares.  Shooting and ducking. Lots of potential for VR sickness but hell. .. it's a roller coaster meets zombie horror if it doesn't make you scared or feel ill what's the point.  Walk on the spot if scrolling  bothers you, but for the minekarts. just squint. or shut your eyes, lol."

Good lighting effects and colour combinations. Occasionally gives motion sickness though. Scary, but okay for a child above 11yrs. Sound effects are scary and very immersive.Real feel of a ride inside a haunted mine. Lot of characters to shoot at. Highly recommended!"
