,Recommended,459220,31261023,Posted: 20 April,all,Roboute Guilliman,"First thing's First. If you never played the console version, it might seem a little jarring to you because of all the wheels and simple mechanics.The second thing, The Publisher NAILED the price perfectly, not because it's a bad game but because they know its age, and its quirks are going to be intimidating at higher prices...that and it's no longer worth a full $40-60.The UI is extremely responsive, the loading is very quick, and there are some minor speed problems which I have to assume is tied to the FPS which might be why V-Sync was enabled.The graphics aren't super crysis levels, and that's fine. But they are definitely better than the original version on the Xbox 360.I loved the old game years ago when I still had a working copy for my 360, to see it released now on Steam is a dream come true, and hopefully an indicator of things to come.There are some minor visual problems, mostly the UI scaling hasn't taken into effect yet, so you're going to have a UI designed for max 720p, though the game resolution is much better overall.The gameplay is still awesome, and it has Co-Op campaign as well. This is how you do games, this is how good ports are made. I can fault 343 for many many attrocities, but this is not an attrocity and it is definitely a good game. It's not a ground breaking RTS but it is a good one none the less. Made by (still around at the time) Ensemble Studios which made excellent RTS's in the past, this port was so far, well done.For $20 I say get it, let's show Microsoft why Steam is prefered over the windows store, and let's let them know there is a vast and viable market waiting for more.*EDIT, I should note, I am hoping the game is moddable. The community can do wonders for this game and might even increase its value ten fold."
,Recommended,459220,31296342,Posted: 22 April,all,泥鰍小妹妹,"What you probably don’t know is that Halo Wars was the final release of Ensemble Studios (Age of Empires). Sadly, even prior to the release of Halo Wars they had been marked for closure. Despite strong sales and a good reception, the writing was on the wall and even the game seemed to be a one-off.Pros+Game has aged very well and transferred well over to the PC+Very smooth and visual upgrades are well made+Game is easy to understand and play+Strips down Real Time Strategy for use on a controller+Lots of love for the Halo Universe+Multiplayer has lots of modes+Online Co-op for CampaignCons-Reuse of Assets can be a bit obvious-Not a game for experienced RTS players-Limitations from the original release are needlessly kept in the game where removing them would improve it-Not a real definitive edition, more of a graphical remaster-limited options availableI feel it’s important to get this information out at the beginning, as sort of a disclaimer. Especially, for those that may have played the original Xbox 360 version. Since there could be some that wonder if it’s worth picking up a Steam VersionOther than running at a smooth 1080p and 60 FPS and including all the DLC, which is mainly multiplayer maps. It also runs up to 4K on PC. Everything about Halo: Wars Definitive Edition is exactly the same, as its Xbox 360 counterpart.Personally, I’m not someone that plays RTS games. Give me a Strategy Role-Playing Game and I’d probably give it a shot. RTS games just have too much going on for me to understand. The draw to the original, like for many others, was probably the Halo tie-in. Being a huge fan of the Halo universe, it gave me a reason to want to play the game. Ensemble and Microsoft absolutely honored that by showing some major love and affection to the Halo lore. From the moment a player starts the game, they are treated to familiar looking menus. Music akin to what’s in the other games. Not to mention, campaign and multiplayer modes.what I enjoyed is how easy it was to setup a base and get units rolling quickly. I wasn’t bogged down with minutia of selecting through so many kinds of units. It was easy to see where the upgrades were and the game explained them. So, I could decide if I wanted to use medics or instead use the healing ability. Then, the focus could go on something else. This goes even further, once there are missions where you are tasked with multiple bases.However, this may be where the game falters a bit. The over simplification can create situations where you just keep pumping out the same units every mission. Controlling multiple bases on the later missions at higher difficulties does add some chaos and variety though. Ultimately, the campaign is more preparation for the multiplayer. Regardless of difficulty, the campaign is fun. But there’s not many situations where your base will get overrun. Especially, if you figure out how to keep bases protected,Conclusion:Halo Wars: Definitive Edition acts as a good remaster of what has shown itself to be a game that stands the test of time fairly well. Still inhibited by restrictions implemented due to its Xbox 360 origins, it still manages to be fairly enjoyable and look pretty decent while doing it.My verdict: 8/10 play it if you are a big HALO fan."

76561198064021071,Recommended,459220,32761979,Posted: 25 June,all,Commander Stealth,"Halo Wars, one of my favorite games I kid you not. This being my first Real Time Strategy Game, It holds a special place in my heart for the Halo franchise. I was ecstatic when I saw this game make it to the Steam Marketplace. Many hours have been put into this game on my old console; I reached the rank of Brigadier in multiplayer.With a compelling campaign that you can play through with a friend if you choose to, and a mostly well balanced multiplayer. In this review for Halo Wars, I will be going over the campaign and multiplayer modes as well as some of the changes from the original edition and the definitive edition.Now some people are immediately going to complain how 'simple' Halo Wars is to play. This game used to be an exclusivefor the Xbox 360 back in 2009, meaning the controls have to have been simplified for the controller, not the mouse * keyboard. Halo Wars is admittedly not as complex as other Real Time Strategy games like Command & Conquer, Warcraft, or Starcraft. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing; it's a nice change of pace from other RTS games and I feel as if Halo Wars gets a lot of people into Real Time Strategy in the first place.Now, there are two major factions in Halo Wars. The United Nations Space Corps (UNSC) and The Covenant Alien Alliance.Each of them have infantry, vehicles, air units, unique units, and uber units. Each unit can effectively counter specific units. There are no specific units that are the best in every situation. This can create tense multiplayer battles and how you fire off your army's abilities can change the tide of battle.The other 3 factions are not playable, and these include the Flood, the Forerunners, and the Rebels (the rebels are only seen on specific multiplayer maps, not seen in campaign). And these factions mainly serve as an obsticle on multiplayer maps to prevent players from just rushing key points very early in the match.CampaignIt's 20 years before the Halo event on installation 04. The war against the covenant rages on. You are James Cutter, Captain of a UNSC war ship known as The Spirit Of Fire. You soon realize the covenant are after a super weapon capable of dooming the human race, and it's your job to lead your army to secure victory and defeat the covenant.With excellently rendered cutscenes throughout each mission helps immerse you into this universe.The famous Legendary difficulty makes it's appearance in Halo Wars, the AI is relentless. There are even collectibles to gather in every mission, this includes skulls and blackboxes.The skulls gan either make the game easier or more difficult, I believe this is the first Halo game to contains skulls that make it easier. The black boxes contain timeline events that go back as far as planet Reach. There are essential details in the campaign that I would rather not spoil for anyone new to Halo Wars.MultiplayerHalo wars multiplayer is very good for the most part, There are 6 characters to choose from before you begin each match. For the UNSC, you have Captain Cutter, Sergeant Forge, and Professor Anders. For the Covenant, The Arbiter, Brute Chieftan, and The Prophet of Regret. Each hero has their own uniqe units and abilities.There are big differences on how each faction operates their army, and this is their tech levels. The UNSC uses nuclear reactors, while the Covenant uses Temples, this can be an issue for the UNSC on the opposing side if the map has claimable reactors. As the Covenant can get max tech at level 3, while the UNSC needs 4 levels. The Covenant gains most of their units at tech level 1, and can further upgrade units by claiming a free reactor instead of spending 2000 recources on the Age of Doubt. This can lead to Wraith rushes against the UNSC which can spell defeat for them if they are not prepared with spartans and anti-tank turrets.This does look like the battle is in favor of the Covenant, but it's actually more balanced than you may think, because the UNSC troops outperform their alien counterparts, but smart and clever use of the many abilities will secure victory.Definitive Edition added features-Server browser for multiplayer-added campaign cooperative matchmaking-all DLC is included with the Definitive Edition!-multiplayer ranks are now separated from achievements-improved visual effectsConclusionMy final rating for Halo Wars is an 8/10If you're a fan of the Halo franchise, or Real Time Strategy, pick up this game. For only $20, this is a great price for a great game, and it comes with all the DLC too!"

,Recommended,459220,31519911,Posted: 3 May,all,Swash,"Now before all of you whopping super duper review readers pin me down and hit my head with a bottle for sharing a different opinion about multiplayer. I'm going to say that this PC port is wonderful, and the way they created multiplayer is a truly fantastic idea for such a smaller community. Let me tell you the pros and cons of this game in my opinion, and why I believe you should play this game.As a highly experienced player, with over 3000+ hours on it (It's literally the same game as the 360 console, with the exception of a different multiplayer lobby setup) I can say this is one of the most balanced games that has different leader powers and different ways to play such as UNSC/Covenant. While many believe that this is not true, there is no main meta character that people choose, as all seem to be equally important depending on the strategy at hand. No one can choose all 3 of the same person and win with ease.Before you buy this game though, please realize that this is a smaller community, and that a lot of people on multiplayer are experienced individuals such as myself. Also, many, but not all, will be very mean once you have been defeated. I've experienced many times just due to my avatar. Come on Halo Wars community you're better than this.Pros:- Heavily Balanced Game- Maps are diverse and unique- Community does help new players learn how to play (I help newer players and will create videos!)- Amazing PC port, in which the game has not crashed even once for me!- A unique multiplayer experience differing from Halo Wars Console Edition- Campaign is quite the playthrough, and is definitely worth the money on it's own- Automatic A.I. in skirmish that learns how you play, and is able to combat you forever. Never stops growing in difficulty- Lots of lore about the halo universe, and an entirely different part of the UNSC you can only readCons:- Multiplayer does allow experienced players and noobs to play together.- Boosters using multiplayer acting like pros and being little hillbillies due to their meaningless boring rank- Hawks.- Game can be hard to get into at first.Now, I'm going to go a little more in depth about multiplayer and kind of try and explain why I believe 343 chose this decision. Now that players are able to ""host"" their own multiplayer lobbies, it allows people to play the game-mode and map that they wish and open it up for any or all players to join. In many RTS games, you are already facing pros and forced to learn how to survive first hand. This is natural, especially for RTS games with such a lower population. Adding a matchmaking system with less than 10,000 people will end up in people never finding games. There's not many lobbies being hosted as is. The population is slowly increasing, however it won't be like when the game first came out. So the people who were expecting it to, are leaving a negative review about the matching skill system. However, I do believe ranks could define actual skill so players can know what kind of player they will be facing. There is no reason to deny that the current multiplayer setup is bad, however it is the best one for a game with such a small community. It allows many of the game-modes and maps to be played without the hassle of waiting on people for hours. A lobby is there, and people will most likely join. That's what's wonderful about this.However, I do believe that the host should not be able to kick people from ranked games, and that a timer should be created in the lobby once it's full. It's ranked, why the hell is the host allowed to kick? Who even thought that was a great idea? Once people are known to be more skillful, they will just be kicked and struggle finding a lobby. I've been kicked out of over 50 games. heh.Over-all the multiplayer setup is a smart move. It'll keep the small community active for a long time. I do truly believe this is the right step for reviving this game.Well, that's all from me. Thank you for taking your time reading. If you want to learn more about the game, don't hesitate to add me or leave a comment!"

76561198031262604,Recommended,459220,31962289,Posted: 25 May,all,The Bored Chairman,"I was a huge fan back in the Xbox 360 days, so I decided to pick this game up for nostalgia sake. In short, it's everything I remembered, but keep one thing in mind while playing this game:It was designed for consoles and controllers. NOT for keyboards and mouses.For the most bit, the game performs quite well and is a great game for newer players looking to get into the RTS genre. However, if you've been spoiled by PC RTS games, you might notice some glaring flaws.Normally, the game pacing is pretty balanced, with my only gripe being that the Covenant gets access to Vehicles and Aircraft after Teching once, compared to the UNSC, who has to tech twice, making Wraith Rushes quite dangerous if the player hasn't trained Spartans or built AT-Turrets.However: if you play a map with empty reactors, this HEAVILY favours the Covenant faction, as they get a free tech upgrade while they would otherwise have to spend 2000 resources, compared to the UNSC's 1200. The UNSC also has to reach Tier 4 tech compared to Covenant Tier 3, and Covanent troops gain access to many of their units and Tier 1 upgrades simply by building a Temple, which also provides them with their Leader unit.It may sound like the game is unbalanced in favour of the Covanent, but fortunately, UNSC troops outperform their Alien counterparts and they have access to some excellent abilities, which helps even the playing field. You'll likely not notice anything that's blatantly unfair, other than the Reactor situation.In terms of AI programming, the biggest threat to you is actually friendly AI leaders, with the Covanent Leaders being the worst of the lot. The AI Brute Chieftain and the Prophet of Regret will ALWAYS spam their unique units until mid game, making them extremely easy to defeat with Flamer Rushes. Only the Arbiter is semi-competent, as his unique unit (the Suicide Grunt) has horrible sustain (for obvious reasons) as such, he rarely builds them. Even with this glaring programming flaw, your allies will likely not build UNSC Troops, instead attempting to rush Vehicles and Aircraft, which often results in their bases being overrun. The friendly AI also has terrible situational awareness compared to enemy AI, as enemies will often coordinate a defense or attack with each other, whereas the friendly AI has poor expansion, often ignoring free bases, will attack enemies even if the odds are against them, resulting in a lot of extra work for the player.As for the rest of the game, it comes with a solid Campaign with Coop mode, something I believe is sorely lacking in modern games, especially RTS games. The cutscenes are extremely well rendered, which I applaud the devs for. The story and characters are well-written (though I'm not a huge fan of Forge, but that's my opinion).I recommend purchasing if you're a fan of the series or enjoy a casual RTS game. If you're a competitive RTS gamer, however, you may find this game to be less than you're accustomed to."
,Recommended,459220,31305653,Posted: 22 April,all,yangjo,"Please Microsoft, you're missing out on bringing probably the most requested game franchise to Steam. I'd suggest bringing it soon while Halo is still a somewhat popular game franchise. Many of us have grown up, some of us will move on from playing games, please cash in on our nostalgia before we go. There's not many big FPS games on steam, all the other huge FPS games right now are on other digital drm platforms likeBattle.net, Origin, etc. The biggest fps game on steam right now is Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and I think bringing Halo on Steam would be massive competition to such a game. Halo 3 in particular has many different gamemodes to play, a competitive ranking system, a well renowned story, map making tool (perhaps improve it), and custom games. Porting Halo to PC would only give you GAINS rather than losses.Sure, Counter Strike is not particularly a game similar to Halo, but it is in the same genre, and that's all should matters to competing.We have this Halo shaped hole in our hearts that desperately need to be filled. This E3, please surprise the hell out of me. (HALO 3 ANNIVERSARY)Other than that, this game is alright. I enjoy Halo Wars 2 better even though it is quite dead on the windows store.

It is truly a masterpiece of a game, and while it is very straightforward in terms of gameplay, buildling and research, its simplicity is actually a benefit rather than a negative aspect. The keyboard and mouse controls take a bit of getting used to, even for RTS players like myself, but after an hour of playing, it is already feeling familiar. Its rare to see a game where there is little difference between using a keyboard and mouse and a controller in terms of fairness, especially for an RTS, but Halo Wars manages it perfectly. The port itself runs great and looks amazing in 1440p. Heres to more Halo on Steam!"

Chronologically within the Halo universe, this is the first game of the entire series, which means that you get additional stories from before the other Halo games. Now to this game alone; it is a tactical RTS with 6 different heroes to choose from (3 covenant, 3 UNSC) with differing specialties and abilites. Here is a Pro/Con list:Pro:RTSEach hero better/worse at different combat situationsWell polishedMore background storyCon:When using the Spirit of Fire (the UNSC's way to use Hero abilities) abilities, the screen is extremely sensitive unless you move very slowly. (Compared to Xbox where the SoF targetting screen was fast, but controllable)""Unit to unit, the UNSC are slightly superior to the Covenant in every way"" -Direct quote from the game itselfThe selection box can be misplaced, i.e.: start holding LMB right behind a unit, and drag, only to have the box start being drawn infront of the unitRegardless of the cons, this game is very engaging, and entertaining. It is definately well worth the $20."

I'd murder someone for the chance to play ODST, H2, or Reach on my computer.ACTUAL REVIEW:Originally starting as a console RTS and in development as far back as 2006, Halo Wars is a fairly standard RTS game that was built to be played on a controller for the Xbox 360. So how well has it stood up to the test of time?One of the few functional RTS games that could even be found on a console - I'm looking at you Command and Conquer - Halo Wars has aged incredibly well, I'm talking as well as the Knights of the Old Republic or Bioshock 2 well. A new coat of paint, a graphics tune-up, plus all the effort it took to port it over to PC, plus all of the existing DLC and yes it's worth the 20-ish dollars you'll have to drop on it.It's a port!Yes, yes it is a port. It bothers me that Halo Wars ported over to the windows store and then released on steam, a game from the Xbox 360 - functioned better on Port-Launch than Halo 5 or the Master Chief Collection did. Seriously, 343 how does that happen. Your job is to make games for the Xbox and Halo Wars, one of the two Bungie-era ""throw-away"" Halo titles is a better port than Batman: Arkham Knight? How the hell does that even happen?How well was it ported? Pretty damn well. There's a few bugs sticking around.- Occasionally pulling up the leader power menu and using something like Carpet Bomb or ODSTs will cause your camera to stick in the same way you would see while using the power after you've used the power. FIX: Zoom in or out.- Disappearing mouse. Sometimes the cursor would just vanish and you couldn't get it back, but were still able to play. FIX: fixed in recent patch. No problems since.- Key Rebinds. You can't rebind to peripheries like extra buttons on your mouse or spare keyboard buttons. WORKAROUND: Logitech SetPoint lets you make spare mouse keys ""act"" like a keyboard key press in-context specific ways (I.e playing a game, like Halo Wars). So move ""Special Attack"" to something like ""L"" on your keyboard, then use SetPoint and add a new context specific Micro for Halo Wars, and set your mouse key as ""L"". Works just as well. NOTE: SetPoint doesn't get along with all games - I also play Planetside 2 and SetPoint drops continual input - i.e sprint was set to mouse 5 for me and my dude would only sprint for a split-second because of SetPoint. WORKAROUND: shut off set point be closing it from the ""Show Hidden Icons"" button next to the time on the taskbar.- Queue Way Points and the Minimap. So, like any decent RTS you can hit the ""order move"" key with units selected and hit directly on the minimap for where you want to go. Halo Wars allows you to queue up successive move points by moving once regularily and then pressing and holding shift and hitting move to on the next spot successively, however if you try to do that while ordering up queued waypoints directly on the minimap it won't work. OVERSIGHT BY THE DEVELOPER. Minor gripe. Units won't accept queued waypoints until they've been told to move regularily so you have to right click to move, and then press Shift and start clicking to queue up way points rather than it just accepting Shift + ""Move to"" as a basic input.Does the game hold up against the original set of gameplay - it's a port after all.Honestly, it's better. Being able to micro units easier means Flamethrower troopers are really awesome. They've added in some RTS mainline Micros - like Task Groups (selecting units and then pressing CTRL + #key and then hitting that #key will select just those units). But not being able to access a building menu while away from your base isn't here. Which is unfortunate.However, some dumb stuff is still here. Remember that clusterf- of trying to get units in a pack to move out of that pack, but it's a mosh pit so they just run into each other and get stuck. Yep. Still there. ""Oh Halo Wars.""The default control scheme is garbage. As I mentioned in the bugs, special attack is bound default on the keyboard - while regular attack is Mouse 2 default. And you can't directly rebind to peripheries.So what's awesome about it?A solid port, that's still getting patch support for some minor things. I mentioned the mouse cursor occasionally disappearing. That's been patched so the Devs actually give a damn.A Halo game on steam. Sorry, I mean aGoodHalo Game on steam.Updated textures, and cutscenes all rated for 4K, all DLC including the Map Pack, Game Pack, and the skins for pre-ordering and getting the delux edition (The fireball warthog and honour guard wraith skins) are included in the base price.Co-op! Yes! Co-Op is here! Play with your buddies on Steam. Campaign, against bots, or vs. one another.There was always something I found ""boring"" on the console version. I figured it out. The console version was based more on Macro with very limited Micro. Microing is so easy on the 'board and mouse. Being able to micro really puts a damper on rushes as well, which was a hugeannoyancetactic on the console. Rushes are still very effective, but they're more managable now. However the micro means that the Arbiter has the best individual leader power because the Brute Chieftain and Prophet of Regret leader powers glue them to the ground, while Arby can jump around. Speaking of the Arbiter, I've had some issues getting his leader power to lock-onto aircraft but the AI can do it fine. This needs some work.I've done Co-op Campaign and Co-Op vs. Bots, but I haven't actually done PvP multiplayer and I've heard some things about no actual MMR being taken into account. Which seriously sucks. It doesn't need place a badge rank, but the system needs some work I doubt it'll get.Overall: 8.5/10 Better than I remember, but not without its flaws. Can't compete with Star Craft or Command and Conquer, multiplayer wise however. Buy it because it's: A solid port, a good halo game. Has a fantastic soundtrack. You can play with your buddies. And so Microsoft will look at the sales figures and go ""Hmmm, we should port some more Halo games to Steam!"" :D"

,Recommended,459220,31372640,Posted: 26 April,all,Milo Jvrament-De-Fèr,"UPDATED 04.05.17(see notes at the bottom)Let me say before anything else, that this review comes as abase-building RTSexpert first, and a Halo fan second. Also, forgive me, but my reviews are long and exhaustive. I don’t like exposing my points too briefly, but I guess I can afford giving a TLDR:Good classical RTS with many features that allow players for turtling, booming, etc. Unit and faction diversity is wide, and allow for players to play according to their taste and play-style. Overall a very good strategy game I would positively associate with Age of Mythology in particular in terms of mechanics. Some minor features are lacking, making some aspects of the game annoying for certain players: not being able to pick your colour, cannot save skirmish games, the unit stats are not visible, no unit formations or orders (e.g. patrolling) etc... Still, I highly recommend the game, and the developers *seem* to be interested in adding community-asked improvements. The price is reasonable.With that in mind, I hope somebody finds the rest of my review useful.Warning for those (either RTS nuts or not) who have never played any Halo game before: I don’t suggest, personally, that you buy the game without either having played the main titles (shooter games as you surely know) or having spent several hours reading up content on the Halo Universe first. I say this knowing that many often overlook the background story to RTS games because of two reasons: developers of the genre generally don’t put too much emphasis and players generally do not care. I often do not either. Then, if you wish you can ignore this advice and buy the game discarding the whole story whatsoever, but if you do intend to play the campaign and enjoy the story, you are informed the game was mainly made as a non-FPS instalment, for consolidated players of the franchise; as such it does not initially provide any good info on what is going on in the galaxy of the 26th century. All you get is a timeline feature in the extras, it isn't bad but isn't definitely not complete or rich with details.I never played Halo Wars on Xbox before, and the PC edition here is my first experience with the game. From what I have seen so far, the game is really well made. Why? Because I’ve encountered too many RTS's which lacked a decent amount of factions, unit diversity, had few or poorly designed/not interesting technologies, etc... I have many examples I could name, but that would surely arise many debates, offend fans of said sagas and I don’t want to expose my review to a flame war. When I say RTS games often lack diversity and content I refer to games with only 3 total factions, games which have no or little unit upgrades, or games which boast only a dozen units per faction. I’ll make an exception, and mention Grey Goo as a vivid example of this. I would describe this RTS as a very classic one, comparable to what is for me the apex of this genre: the Age of Empires series(1). My reasoning is based on the following elements:1. Units have several upgrades each, not as many as some other games, but they have a lot of impact, often changing the unit weaponry and equipment.2. Units are really diverse, some overlapping in role and thus allowing for more creative, customised strategies. Personally a game has enough units when you can completely disregard some in favour of others just because you like their aesthetics, without sacrificing your performance.3. The opposing factions are two, but each has a hero with a unique unit and a unique power or a super unit (Covenant or Humans respectively). This means the games has 6 factions rather than the boring three I’ve seen in so many games.4. Game as an age-up feature, something I found to be absent in so many RTS’s. It’s a matter of taste, but I like base building and researching technologies – Halo Wars has it all!5. As mentioned above, the game is not focused on capturing points, which pushes players into an aggressive and quick playstyle in almost all cases. The resources are obtained primarily from structures attached to one’s base, allowing players to play with a highly defensive stance known as Turtling, or for a fast economic development called Booming. Good news for you, yes, some factions perform better at turtling, some at booming, etc. If you want some advice I found, so far, that the best Turtlers seem to be the Covenant in general, both the Brute Chieftain and the Prophet give you unique units that are suitable for a defensive gamestyle. The Arbiter is said to work great as a defensive unit himself.(1)I played many other strategy games, and I don’t consider the Cossacks or Battle for Middle Earth series, for instance, inferior. However AoE has some advantages over others such as the fact it has covered many historical periods and even a (historical) mythological scenario. Its engine has also allowed some franchise-based games such as that of Star Wars to come to life.My brief conclusion is that of the TLDR you can read above.As a last (and tedious) note, please do not take my comments upon fast-paced and point-capture RTS’s as harsh. If you feel my comments on this subgenre too unjust, it’s because players who enjoy the more classical strategy games have suffered a tremendous lack of new titles in the past decade and a half – while the former category has gained more and more popularity and eventually became totally mainstream and simplistic in some cases. On the other hand most of the old-school RTS types and their series simply died out before the market took any notice of them, maybe it was for the best.. Still, the decline of our beloved classical genre has disappointed many, and caused despite for the newcomer subgenre in others.Bottom notes as of May 3, 2017This is a brief list of pros and cons I am adding progressively as I continue experiencing all of the game features. I tried to incorporate all of it in my original review but felt it would be confusing, and would alter the text too much.Cons:-There are no walls, or barricades, or trenches, or any other sort of additional defensive building that the player can construct to his liking. I believe walls would perhaps look stupid, but entrenchments and fencing items would seem appropriate especially as they were often seen in game. For humans jersey barriers are common in the campaigns, and so are ""Covenant defense barriers"".-Technologies are a bunch like I previously stated, but I think there could have been a lot more, possibly giving the player a little bit more of strategy as in many other classic strategy games. Universities in historical RTS games I have in mind usually contain about a couple dozens of technologies to be researched - no, they are not all relevant or interesting as the ones in HW, but their quantity and diversity are vastly superior. A matter of taste I assume...+The graphics are all in all beautiful, and all the effects pertaining the explosions, the bullets, or just the unit animations are amazing. I am extremely satisfied with the way the game looks, it makes the battles very enjoyable+The campaign has a lot of cutscenes, is well designed and fun to play. I usually and categorically avoid campaigns in RTS games, never started any but a couple on AoE II. I made an exception here and I was not disappointed.-I would have loved to be able to place not just barriers around my base, but also houses, farms, etc to give more immersion while looking at my base, and scenario around. Yes, I know this is not a historical setting with workshops and farmsteads, but in the halo universe the need for housing and a food replenishment system still exists. Again, a matter of taste, it would have added realism.+The music is catchy and beautiful. I have always found that music is an important aspect of most games, but especially so in strategy ones due to the frequent moments of tranquillity."

Players get to control all of the Halo universe enemies and hero's.The player's gameplay of Halo Wars consists of building and controlling army's to destroy their opponents base, while defending their own. Players will construct structures and base's to produce a variety of units, such as tanks, Spartans, ODST squads, Grunts and Ghosts. Bases are locked locations with limited building zones, however can be upgraded to account for more buildings. Buildings include reactors, turrets, barracks, mortar pools, and aircraft stations. Halo wars plays like an RTS game but is restrictive in population and building locations. This doesn't take away from the RTS gameplay much, however may be frowned upon by hardcore RTS players.The story of Halo Wars follows Sergeant Forge on his journey under the command of Captain Cutter. The story and gameplay of the campaign has variety and has been polished, but has a tendency to let they player camp down and wait without much backlash. The voice acting and visuals of the campaign are solid and fit well, and Halo Wars is a good looking game for its time. The campaign follows Forge on various planets fighting Covenant and other enemies, some of which include fungal life forms. Disappointingly, the Fungal Life forms are not a playable race.Halo Wars Definitive Editiondoes some things right:•Fun skirmish and multiplayer•Pretty well balanced•Great looking game•Campaign feels like halo•Variety of campaign missions•Good storyHalo Wars Definitive Edition does a few things wrong:•Can turtle in most campaign missions•Can win most matches by spamming a single unit type•Skirmish AI can be dumb•Decent but unpolished voice overs•Lack of skirmish refining & feels unfinishedOverall, Halo Wars Definitive Edition is a classic and fantastic RTS game. To hardcore RTS fans, it may lack features other RTS games have, however this does not take away from the game at all.

I was really happy when I heard it was coming to steam as I was majorly dissapointed over the fact Halo Wars 2 wasn't being released on steam but rather Microsoft's sorry excuse for a PC gaming platform. One thing I recommend is holding ALT and zooming out as it gives you a better view of the battlefield.The campaign runs amazingly and overall the graphics are a treat compared to the old 360 version. I always loved the fact the campaign has CO-OP so I'm looking forward to completing it again with a friend and killing some Covie scum.Some people have complained about multiplayer not working but I created a skirmish game with my friend and within a minute or so two other people joined and we were straight into battle; we got our asses handed to us but that's beside the point...Overall this game is a great remaster and worth every penny. My only real challenge coming from 360 has been dealing with the hot new graphics and remembering to use hot keys. I hope they add workshop support because I can tell any mods made for this game will be bloody great. Now to pray to the Forerunners in hope they bring Halo Wars 2 to Steam.

This game  is good for those that are looking for a casual game that doesn’t have a steep learning curve. However, this means it doesn't have the depth that will make the game enjoyable forever.If you're a Halo fan, you'll appreciate the story mode and the various skulls and collectibles to find along the way. The cut scenes are still good to this day, amazing soundtrack, and memorable characters like Cutter, Forge, and Anders. The missions thrown your way are varied enough. For 8 hours you will be defending locations, people, with varying starting strength, tech, and heros.The game mechanics follows a rock, paper, scissors system like other RTS games. However, it seems a little shallow, ecspecially when it appears that some factions have better units. An example would be Jackals vs. Marines. One unit is a sniper while the other has to get much closer before it can fight back. The game can have extremely annoying early game tactics as some factions are vulnurable to an early game rush. There are also some unit combonations that are hard to counter with certain factions.Overall if you’re new to strategy games or want a more laid back not micro heavy style of game this game will be good. If you’re looking for depth or a well-balanced game, skip this game. If your not a Halo fan, skip this game."

Own so many Halo related things. There's even a Grunt figure chillin' by my PC as I type this.That all said, I've never really played this game. Owned it long ago, but had no clue what I was doing, as I never played an RTS before. I still live up to that today. This was my first of this genre. I've seen it labeled as a good intro to RTS', which made the purchase a lot more convincing to me. Also it's ♥♥♥♥ing Halo.I'm about half way through the game right now, and I am loving it! The game play is easy to follow. Controls very well on M&K. Looks pretty good. Base building is simple, selecting units is good, all that. It all made it easy to get with.As for it being Halo-ey. It's great! The ODST Spartans are fun, the leader stuff is good too. I'm not far in enough to know what's going on, but the Arbiter being involved seems cool!Performance wise it seems prefectly fine. 120 FPS cap I think. Good enough for this. Textures are decent, look much better than I thought an old title would. Also it works really well in borderless.In the end, I love this game. I'm so excited to keep on going! The only thing that bums me out about this entire thing, is the fact that I can't play the main series titles on Steam. I hope this game did well enough to convince somebody, somewhere, to get Halo 1, 2, 3, MCC, what ever, on here someday.EDIT: Just beat the game! Fantastic story,ending was a bit upsetting. Seemed to blow past quick.All in all, great for me. Loved it all! :)"

They even got the price tag right with this title, 15.99 seems pretty reasonable for a ""remastered"" classic. This title is also a personal all time favourite in terms of Real time strategy.I'm going to start with the pros:- Wide variety in units, as well as generals to play as- Each general is different, having their own special ability as well as their own special unit which makes them feel unique- Being an RTS game the tensions are high, as you will need to plan your style of play accordingly, choosing either a defensive or offensive position(or both) in order to win the game- The story was surprisingly interesting for me, with some pretty decent story telling in terms of characters and dialogue along with a wide variety of objectives- The campaign on the 360 takes about 5 - 8 hours to beat, depending on your playstyle, I am currently half way through so far on the PC steam versionCons (While I struggle to find anything wrong with this title, these cons are more like nitpicks if anything)- Modding could be added, imagine being able to mod a game in the Halo series- Sometimes the camera has movement issues on the mini map when I try jumping from one area to anotherOverrall, if your a fan of the Halo series or RTS games in general, you should pick this up. It's safe to assume that we might be getting other games in the Halo series ported onto Steam so if we can show as much support as we can maybe this will be a dream come true for many of us :)"

,Recommended,459220,31274687,Posted: 21 April,all,Viper123_SWE,"I figured I'd write a review for this since I've played the literal♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Halo Wars on Xbox 360 and later Xbox One.First off I'll begin addressing the state of the PC-port. Surprisingly I've had very few issues with it. Halo Wars on PC features both mouse and controller support, the former works very well considering that the original game had no mouse support and the former also works just as well as it originally did.PC controls (mouse & keyboard) are a bit un-orthodox when compared to other PC RTS games such as Starcraft II, Company of Heroes, etc.Most of the keyboard hotkeys can be rebinded and while the controls are a bit ~funky~ at first they are easy to get used to.My only problem right now with the keyboard controls is the lack of a proper multitask command (commonly shift) so as of now you can't units multiple commands.Graphics-wise the game holds up well IMO and despite the requirements most machines should be able to play this on maximum with little to none impact on FPS and other performance. The game looks considerably better than the old 360 classic and you can't count the individual polygons on a model anymore.Sound and visual effects are all on-point. As with the graphics the FX have also been updated (they look less cartoony too IMO).As for the rest of the game it still hold sup if you ask me. I've always been a fan of Halo and I'm probably one of the few who loved the original game on Xbox.The story, characters and environments are all interesting and I definitely recommend Halo Wars for fans of Halo or for people new to the RTS genre looking for a good introduction into strategy games."

Halo is one of my favorite game series, and this game deserves deserves the title ""Halo"" (unlike Halo 5, in my opinion).  This game has some really fun mechanics, a great storyline, and outstanding characters.As an owner of this game on console as well, I can say that you will not be disappointed by this version of the game.  It is great that I can run it in 1080P with more than 30fps on my current setup, and it looks great and runs amazingly.  It is fun to play this version of the game and I wish Halo Wars 2 was available on platforms other than Windows 10 (though from a Microsoft business standpoint, it is understandable it is only available on the Windows store).I would give this game overall a 10/10 and this version deserves the same score of 10/10 because I really enjoy the experience on PC.

Just playing on PC instead of Xbox so you may have a better experience.Now as for Multiplayer Gameplay, I find it much more fun than Halo Wars on the Xbox, because you can communicate to your allies/enemies.It's also a lot faster to play, and gives it a more competetive feel, now that you have so many hotkeys to use.Now on to the most discussed topic, the way in which you find games.In my honest opinion, it's WAY, WAAY better. Instead of match making for a game, waiting in queue for 10+ minutes, you can search for games and join in less than a minute.It also allows you to search for multiple modes, and number of players. Ex: Search for 3v3,2v2, and 1v1 matches at the same time.It's a lot easier to find games. You can launch HW, and be in a game within 2 minutes.There is a downside to lobby games, though. Eventually you get to know the players, and learn who is good/bad.This is bad for multiple reasons, If you're a good player, it *can* be very hard to start a game, because the enemy might just leave the lobby once they see you're on the enemy team.It's also bad because good players can lobby hop untill they find players they know are bad, and beat them to improve their ranking.This is all possible, but I wouldn't say there's a definite chance it would happen.(ignore the console fanboys saying the new search system is broken)ALSO, THERE'S MOD SUPPORT. THERE. IS. MOD. SUPPORT. THINK OF THE POSSIBILITES!!!!! (although it will probably take a bit for the good mods to come out)For me, buying this was obvious. I love Halo Wars, and I will get so many hours out of this game playing Online.If you've already experienced the campaign, have multiple hours in multiplayer, and just want to buy the game for a couple hours of casual PvAi, I personally wouldn't buy it. Unless it goes on sale, it's not worth the $22 for 5~ hours of already experienced gameplay."

High refresh works perfectly, other than in cutscenes. I play at 1440p165hz and it looks great. There are still a few bugs, I had my mouse cursor disappear during a multiplayer match which made it very difficult to play (had to restart the game afterwards to fix.)

76561198141552273,Recommended,459220,31288954,Posted: 21 April,all,Charles Dickinson Took This L,"I've been a Halo fan for as long as I can remember, and Halo Wars was my first Halo game. My father was rather strict about M games when I was a child, so when he saw a T rated Halo game that required strategy he thought it would be a great learning experience. It took me years to realize it, but he's one hundred percent right. When I first played this I thought it was boring and had ""no action"", but as I've aged so has my realization that flashy set pieces and epic guns aren't the things that make games great. This game is a simplified rts, but that doesn't mean it's easy. One must understand the rock paper scissor system in place to take full advantage of their enemy, and find a play style which leads them to victory. You can be punished for a mistake, or rewarded for success, it depends on what your game plan is. The main bungie Halo arc is my favorite story in gaming, perhaps in all of media, but for me the story isn't the main selling point for this game. For beginning rts player, or experienced ones at that, this game will make you feel as if you're playing a game of chess, and it will push your mind to it's best potential. I can't thank my father enough for showing me this game, it legitimately helped grow my critical thinking capabilities. Plus it's ♥♥♥♥ing Halo. Buy it, you won't regret a thing.- Zack"
,Recommended,459220,31346541,Posted: 24 April,all,[-NoE-] Mortis Angelus,"A GAME WITH HUGE POTENTIAL, BUT WITH A LACKLUSTER PC-PORT!TL,DR:So why do I still recommend this game? Because even if it is filled with minor, yet somewhat annoying, flaws, most of the things I've listed above can (if they want to) be fixed with patches and updates. The game to its core is still solid, even if it is not a perfect experience on PC. But mostly, buy this game so we hopefully can get more Halo-games to PC.Let's be honest here: I bought this game for one reason only: To try to vote with my wallet and show Microsoft that we want ALL Halo-games to PC. I even paid the ""full price"", whereas I usually would have waited for some kind of sale for an old game like this.Now, as I write this ""review"" I have only played the tutorial of the game. I have watched the cutscenes from this game many times over but never been able to play it as I have never owned an Xbox 360. So instead of giving a deep analysis of the game, here are a few things I have noticed in my first 60 minutes or so:- The in-game cutscenes (not the pre-rendered ones) are stuck in some weird 30 fps interpolation. The game displays 60 fps (according to the fps counter), but it lags/jitters just like the game would at 30 fps. As soon as the cut-scene is over it is butter-smooth again.- The game does NOT like if you run your system audio in 192 khz. It creates a lot of static noise and crackeling. Taking the quality down to 96 khz fixes these issues. Not a biggie, but I would prefer a fix for this. Annoying to have to change audio settings everytime I open this game- People say this is an ""excellent"" port for PC and I highly have to disagree:1) The UI-scaling is too big and the field of view is too narrow. It feels like I'm looking at a sub-FullHD game upscaled to 1440p, rather than actually looking at something that is 1440p. I kinda expect that for the game though, as it is a X360-port. But I think it should be mentioned. I just can't help the feeling that I would like to zoom the camera out more than is currently possible.EDIT: I now found out how to zoom in/out with the camera. But I still feel it would be nice to be able to zoom out even further.2) Keybinding is limited... Seriously! Whichever company that was responsible for porting this game; SHAME ON YOU! Why on Earth did you decide it would be a good idea to make some actions re-mappable, and some locked down? E.g. You have specific buttons for rotating the camera left/right, but they are locked to buttons ""delete"" and ""insert"". Like WTF???? There is NO - and I really mean it - NO reason for locking down key-bindings on a PC-port.3) Camera-movement is way too aggressive. Clicking any of the WASD-buttons moves the camera way too agressively and quickly to either direction. This is a direct result of poorly ported controls from an analogue stick input to keyboard controls. On Xbox 360 you can easily decide how fast the camera moves with the joysticks, but on a keyboard it is 100 % speed from the get-go. The same goes for rotating the camera. Not only must you hold ALT + Mouse movement Left/right to rotate the camera, but also here it activates 100 % movement; like mouse input would be either ON or OFF, and not speed dependent. FIX THIS PLEASE! Lower the speed of the camera.- When grouping units, why the frack is there no group-indicator or number indicator so I would know which key I binded which group to? This again feels like a rushed over-sight: ""Yes, we must add grouping, because all RTS-games on PC has it! But don't bother adding any indicator. They won't need that!""So is there anything good about this game? Probably YES. Probably everything that was great about it already on Xbox - I will see when I progress in the game. I'm mostly complaining about PC-port-specific issues. But the point is: Even if it was great on Xbox 360 with the mechanics it had there, it might not be up to snuff for PC as the mechanics we are used to on this platform is vastly different; RTS was born on PC, so we expect a bit more from an RTS title in terms of how to control things. On Xbox (or any console) I think this is one of the only RTS-games that has ever been released, so the stakes are also much lower. I've also seen other reviews complaining about localized/region locked multi-player. I don't know, but if those claims are true, then STOP IT MS! STOP IT! Global matchmaking please!So why do I still recommend this game? Because even if it is filled with minor, yet somewhat annoying, flaws, most of the things I've listed above can (if the devs want to) be fixed with patches and updates. The game to its core is still solid, even if it is not a perfect experience on PC. But mostly, buy this game so we hopefully can get more Halo-games to PC. But if you are a hardcore PC-RTS-gamer, this game might put you off just because of those odd choices when it comes to controlling the game mechanics and the camera."

But it makes more strategic when you must think before you place.)I've had little issues with this port, some things like.- Slight lag under heavy pressure (Lots of Units or Explsions going on at once)- 1 or 2 random game crashes when first downloading the game. (They've stopped. So I think it's just a base start port issue when it's first downloaded.)- Glitchy sound time to time during Caginpain- I wish they stopped spamming on Multiplayer 😥😥- Units phasing into the ground (COUGH, ARBITER, COUGH)- Some multiplayer connection issues.But I'd personally say, after logging 100s of hours into Halo Wars on Xbox 360...

It is a very simple Rock, Paper, Scissors RTS game that someone could learn quickly.3. It is a game where you can play on...- Easy - which makes enemies brainless so you can learn the game- Normal - where they show signs of aggression so you can step up your game against an enemy- Heroic - where the enemy starts getting aggressive much earlier introducing some rushing elements to challenge you- Legendary - which allows you to harness your ability to maximize on time, resources, and rotating units4. It feels like Halo without it being Halo. I can build Spartans and they be a presence as they take vehicles. Scorpion tanks feel and sound like they should. Banshees feel like they should. It doesn't feel like it's just a reskinned game to look like Halo.5. Introduces new vehicles and units that challenge certain army builds and counter others.6. You get all of the DLCs, which includes more than a handful of maps and modes, and it adds to the game.Cons:1. In this version on Steam, the online/matchmaking element is... pretty bad. It requires you find games already set up in a pool of players that was small from the day it was released because of how you have to find lobbies with people. The random matchmaking element that was on the console version is gone. :(I loved this game on console and I love it here. A friend and I love to get on and play against computers to do silly stuff and see how fast we can get units up and size up. What kills this game is the horrible matchmaking system/lack there of. Because of this, there is no real true skill system. It killed the community very quickly.

Playing on controller is still just as bad if not worse, so don't expect improvement from that.Huge interface meant for TVs, not widescreen computer displays, looks very ugly and offputting.A big reason why this game has a positive review score on Steam is because of people who bought and played the game on console many years ago, and didn't have anything better. Later they buy it on Steam to drop a nostalgia-fueled positive review that doesn't reflect the standards of RTS on PC at all. Therefore, be warned that the score is partially misleading. It could be an OK game if someone wants something extremely simple, but even then there are better RTS for it so I can't recommend this one."

Now yes it may be simplistic, nothing near Hearts of Iron, Sins of A solar Empire, Stellaris, or Supreme Commander in terms of complexity.. But that is where it shines. It is easy to learn and get into but it takes time to know the strategies, especially in multiplayer! Yes, you may have seen people win with rushes like a warthog rush, a simple and effective strategy, but it can be easily countered with a Scorpion or two (Or Wraiths) and some air units. Another good covenant strategy is the Hunter-Jackal combination, but in its own regard, is garbage against air units such has Hornet's and Hawks, if you play as forge you can even use Grizzly's to wipe them out.Those are only a few of the strategy's to Halo Wars multiplayer, there are TONS of ways to play and counter your enemies, and it makes the game ""complex"" in its own use of simplicity. Can be super casual or super competitive depending on how you play. (The only downside I have seen to Halo Wars in multiplayer is people quitting early because the enemy has the ever-so-slightest advantage and is too lazy to counter it) Also not to forget that the Definitive Edition includes all the DLC from console meaning that there are more gamemodes to be played too over the base game!Now the Campaign:It has a wonderful campaign! It shows the Halo universe from a different standpoint just like Halo: Reach and Halo 3 ODST but in an RTS style. The campaign has pleased me greatly and even more so in Legendary Co-op with a friend. The cutscenes in the game still look amazing and they were made in 2009 (With a few revamps just like the actual game itself in the Definitive Edition) there are a few flaws though mostly when it comes to the setup of the missions. Nothing too large, just a few personal tics such as the Covenants spam of useless units sometimes which in its own regard is fun to mow them down, but doesn't offer the biggest challenge. Other than minor things like that, its great overallPS: FORGE IS DOWNExtras:-Great Music (Feels like a true Halo game!)-Nice and easy to learn control scheme-Great graphics! (Explosions look even cooler with a skull and you can make the physics rediculous with another skull)-Gathering blackbox's you unlock more and more pieces of the Halo Timeline feature in the main menu which gives you loads of lore"

It's a very good port with all of the original goodness of the original plus the bonus of having PC and Keyboard advantages such as numbered control groups and selection boxing.However there are some issues that detract from this otherwise great experience. The two big ones I noticed was the need to press and hold the alt key to rotate and zoom the camera. A simple right-click drag for rotating the camera and using the mouse wheel for zooming would be preferable.The biggest bug I found was, after using the ""Spirit of Fire""/special abilities menu, my cursor suddenly vanished. I could still select and click units but the cursor was invisible. It remained this way even after leaving to the main menu. This is a bug that needs to be fixed.Aside from those two issues, the game plays almost better than the original. I hope some Steam Workshop support comes to the game if it hasn't already as that would make this game even better than before."

While playable, they are really awkward in regards to placement and you can't remap the majority of them.(Really apparent in the camera control keys) On top of that you can't assign any to mouse buttons.

My first ever rts game. I was a console player, and this was the top selling rts for the xbox 360. So I picked it up and boy did I enjoy it. I am a huge fan of halo (having read some of the books and have played every single halo game), and too anyone who hasn't experienced the story of halo. You are missing out. Now I may be a bit biased, however I am not alone when I say that the halo universe is quite exciting. You won't be playing with the Master Chief in this game, but instead you will be taking command of the Spirit of Fire, a modified colony ship, and help fight the losing battle against the Covenant. This game captures the universe at it's grittiest, especially with the opening cut scene.For those who have had no experience with halo, you can still pick it up and enjoy the story. The best thing about Halo War's story is that it is set at the very beginning of the human-covenant war, on the planet Harvest. All the backstory you need is that negotiations went south (there is a reason for this I won't spoil, but it has something to do with the religon of the Covenant) and the United Nations Space Command are fighting for survival against the genocidal campaign of the aliens.The gameplay, I'm going to be honest, is not the greatest. This was a game made for the xbox 360. It is very dumb-downed and should not be compared to some of the RTS greats like starcraft and SupCom. However, it is very good for a first RTS game and casual RTS players looking for some fun. However, every hero is unique. The game play is still very fun, and is based on a 'rock, paper scissors' system (which imho I never found to have a strong presence, they are more soft counters).However, Halo Wars is still very fun to play, and is a good introduction to the halo universe for new players."

If you are new to Halo Wars or RTS in general for that matter, this game may come off confusing at first if you dont somewhat attempt to do the tutorial. Do not be alarmed though, just because it takes about 20 min to get used to doesnt mean you should be worried. The controls are just a tad bit complicated, but nothing an average pc gamer couldnt figure out, plus with this technically being a console to pc port, it comes with full controller compatibility. Not just xbox 360 and One controllers, but also playstations DUALSHOCK 4 controller, which is my fav because i personally enjoy PS more than Xbox, but that isnt the point.Next lets get into the gameplay. Im gonna be honest, i will never complete the story for this game because i have way more fun going online and playing against other people. If you actually want to play the story, get the game because most people say halo wars' story wasnt that bad. I dont care about it because I enjoy the multiplayer more. If you're just getting the game for a casual intro to the RTS genre, you can play it basic like i did when the game first came out back on the 360. But, if you are also looking for something that puts on a challenge and gives you a reward for winning, this game is still for you. Making a solid plan with your team like having nothing but Hawks and Brutes is one of the most fun situations to play with and against. Point is this game is for everyone.So if you actually decided to sit through my first review that i typed up while i was bored because im not playing this game, congratulations, you get to hear my rating. I give this game a 9/10 which isnt really important to you because im some random dude on the internet.

To appeal to a console audience, the gameplay and RTS elements remained relatively simplistic and facile. It's also important to note that this game was not meant to be released on the PC by the original developers, Ensemble Studios.If you're looking for an in-depth RTS, then it's recommended to skip this title. However, the story and fast-paced skirmish gameplay makes this a good buy for anyone looking for a competitive game, and for sure, is a must-have for any Halo fan. Sure to bring nostalgia to any Halo fan, Halo Wars: DE will likely have you replaying the countless hours of campaign and multiplayer with a new community and platform.In short, this isn't another mobile top-down shooter like the Spartan Assaults.

76561198026017825,Recommended,459220,31823103,Posted: 18 May,all,DeportMeDaddy,"This game was the cornerstone of my existence from March 2009 all the way until now. I have logged probably 2-3x the hours in this game than my entire Steam library combined, so I have no idea how many 1000's of hours I have played Halo Wars.Halo Wars was released by Ensemble Studios in March 2009, the same developers that brought us the Age of Empires series, so if nothing else, you would know that Halo Wars was created by basically the grandfather of RTS games. I cannot remember when they began the project, but I believe it was somewhere between 2005-2007.What people need to understand about the ""limited"" content is that it is a port from the Xbox 360, as such, Ensemble had to develop the game with the limits of the Xbox 360 in mind. So, let's go over some of the complants that people have.-""My Scarabs are getting destroyed too easily.""Even though the Scarab is classifed as an ""Uber"" unit and it takes up 3000 of your resources + 20 out of your max 50 population as Covenant, the Scarab is not the be all end all of units and strategies in Halo Wars. A Scarab is just another vehicle and without the proper support it will get destroyed, as with all other strategies you must keep in mind what the enemy team and what your team is building and plan your military and strategy accordingly.-""Scout vehicles are useless.""The 3 ""Scout"" units in the game are the UNSC's ""Warthog,"" the Covenants ""Ghost"" and exclusive to the Brute Chieftain the ""Chopper.""The Ghost, even though it has a research tree, is almost entirely useless after the first 5 minutes of the game. It is good only for killing un-upgraded scouts in the start of the game because they start with a weapon, unlike the Warthog and the chopper. Other than that, I have seen them maybe dodge a few Cobra shots or RPG's, but they take up too much room en masse and are not good at anything to supplement your army. It is best just to forget you can build them.The Warthog does not start with a gun, though it does start with a ram ability. As you upgrade the Warthog you will add a turret, then a grenadier and finally you will replace the turret with a gauss turret. This is the only Scout unit in the game that I (personally) would incorporate into a full army, but only for a specific purpose. The Warthog is an extremely good supplement for taking out air units, though by themselves, they die pretty quickly, so it is not recommended to send them in to fight air alone, the air must be distracted by something else for the Warthogs to deal damage. Good in combination with Hawks or Hornets to fight Vampires or to get a slight edge on other air units.The Chopper, you would see me using this more if they did not cost 2 population and were not in the Factory. Choppers are okay against light units, they take the least damage from their ram ability and have the best health of all the Scout units, but there are too many cons to create a Factory just to build Choppers (or anything for that matter with the exception of Locusts.)-""When my partner(s) die (or leave) I don't get any of their population or other assests, so I can't continue the game.""Well yeah, you don't get anything of theirs, that's kinda the point. It's meant to be an extreme cripple when one of your allies is taken out, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the game's over for you. Depends on what the enemy has vs. what you have in terms of a military. Attack immeadiately, try to do the same thing they did to you to one of theirs and hopefully you'll balance the scales. I was in a game back on the 360 where both of my partners abandoned me in the first 30 minutes and it ended up being a 2v1 against me. That game lasted over 4 1/2 hours and I still won.I could go on with this, but it already seems like this is getting too long for a review, so I'll stop here but if anybody has any questions, feel free to add me on Steam and ask away.If anybody is interested in joining a gaming community (not a clan) for Halo Wars and a lot of other games, I'll leave all of the information down below.Renegade GamingTeamspeak -renegadegaming.typefrag.comSteam Group -http://steamcommunity.com/groups/renegadegamingcommunitypcYou can read our description in the Steam group if you're interested."

Only thing I would say is because this was a Xbox title back in 2009, expect this game to work better with a controller.Go grab it, if nothing else it will be a trip down memory lane, just in better detail! :)-Edit just be careful if you go against the UNSC as the Covenant, you can do absolutely ♥♥♥♥ all against them if they decide to go air straight off the bat.

Now, with this PC port, it feels like everything I disliked about it is now much better. Gameplay is smooth, controls are easy to pick up, great for a first time RTS player (like myself) and just an all around well polished game.Only cons I have are when people resign the game freezes for a moment, which may be expected? And the other is that there are only 6 playable characters, which leaves little to choose from when you want to try a new class.Would definitely recommend the game after a few hours of playing. At first, I didn't know if it would stick with me, but it really has in the long run."

If I was to play multiplayer it would be with friends."
,Recommended,459220,31314835,Posted: 23 April,all,Caboose,"Halo Wars was my first introduction to the RTS genre, and it was probably one of my most played Halo and Xbox 360 games. I love this game so much, so seeing it get a proper Steam release is great.STORY: (6/10)Halo Wars story is decent for both a Halo and RTS game. The game takes place 20 years before the events of Halo: Reach and the original trilogy. While some of it's characters aren't very memorable and it does have some cheesy moments, it also has some pretty awesome scenes involving the SPARTANS. The missions themselves are fun to play through, though on Legendary difficulty they can be a bit challenging.GAMEPLAY: (9/10)As an RTS game, Halo Wars is pretty simple. Since it was designed for consoles, it has watered-down RTS mechanics (no free base building, small unit cap and only one resource type). But this doesn't detract from the gameplay at all. The slower gameplay is a plus for me, since I'm not good at the multi-tasking other RTS games demand from you. While it's not nearly as intensive as other strategy games such as Starcraft or WH40k, there's still a good amount of strategy involved and micro/macro is still important. You get to play as both the UNSC and Covenant in multiplayer, both of them having 3 leaders. The UNSC gets access to leader abilities, while the Covenant gets to control hero units. All of the units are fun to play around with, and they are generally balanced.GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE/AUDIO: (9/10)For being an 8 year old game, the game's graphics still hold up nicely. The unit models/textures and resolution are improved from the original game. The audio has also been significantly been improved. The game runs smoothly on my PC, and I haven't encountered any issues yet. A nice addition 343 included with the Definitive Edition, was unlocking the pre-order unit skins for both the Warthog and the Wraith for everyone.CONTROLS: (8/10)While the original game was very playable on a controller, being able to use a mouse and keyboard is much nicer.The controls are mostly great, though some things such as using leader abilities do feel pretty sluggish. The hot keys are pretty standard for an RTS game. Another nice addition is the ability to create command groups with your units, which was missing in the original game.ONLINE FEATURES: (8/10):While there are no dedicated servers as it uses P2P connection, it does a feature a server browser where you can search games on. The multiplayer set-up system is very nice, allowing you to host both multiplayer games and campaign missions, with several option such as skulls being able to be toggled.CONCLUSION:Overall, the Steam version of Halo Wars: Definitive Edition is a good port with some small issues. No doubt that you should buy this over the Windows 10/Windows Store version, as it has a much smaller playerbase. If you are looking for a simple but yet fun RTS, or wanting an interesting take on the Halo universe, pick it up!I'm happy to see that 343 Industries is interested in bringing more Halo games to Steam, and I hope this a good sign of things to come. My hopes are that they bring Halo Wars 2 and most importantly, the original trilogy and Reach to Steam aswell (though I wouldn't mind Halo 4 or even Halo 5 aswell!)"

,Recommended,459220,31345625,Posted: 24 April,all,Lightning Fanboy,"Finally, one of my favorite RTS games from the last gaming generation comes to steam. While Halo Wars may appear to be lacking in depth at face value, under the hood lies a rewarding RTS experience. With this game Microsoft managed to strike gold in my opinion with one of the finest balances of a casual RTS wherein a seasoned player can adopt advanced strategies for drawn out matches. This however does not exclude newer players from jumping into matchmaking with success with a fine-tuned unit pool for each race and special units making for a rich variety in playstyle with each being viable. Hawk rushing with Anders can be just as viable as playing for a long game and making a healthy mix of armies with up to two teammates. On top of this the fantastic multiplayer experience is complimented by a very interesting campaign that in and of itself on higher difficulties prepares the player for PvP. A fantastic soundtrack underlies each mission as well as very unique level and objective design keeps each mission feeling fresh. Overall for $20 the game is a steal and hopefully opens the gates for more of the franchise (especially Halo Wars 2) to find its way on steam. A word of warning as the playerbases are split between the steam and windows store version and rushing early as convenant are still present and can be frustrating without proper counterplay."

I later picked it up over the summer of 2009 and actually got into it. It really was the best console strategy game available and still is. I prefer this to any PC strategy game just because of it's fun, ""pick up and play"" mindset while balancing tactics without making it overly complicated. It is best played with a controller such as a PlayStation or Xbox controller as it was orignally designed for. Really glad they brought one of my old favorites to Steam. It's in my top 15 games of all time to be honest. It doesn't seem like it's been 8 years and it kind of makes me sad but I'm glad MS finally decided to bring it to Steam where I can enjoy it with extra features and play it in 4K 60fps all these years later.""BASE UNDER ATTACK""Gotta go, see you on the battlefield!"

Played this game years ago non stop and it feels so good to play again with up to date visuals. As others have said, Its not the most in depth RTS out there but it definitely can be one of the most entertaing ones! It runs and looks great, Its easy to find/invite friends/set up online games. My only negative so far is I have experienced some lag in the multiplayer matches, May just be my internet but thats the only negative I have. Its a fair price in my opinion and I highly recommend it!"

I was wondering when you'd-...What's that? This remaster wasn't made by Ensemble Studios? ...It was made by 343 Industries? ...Oh. I see. How awkward.*AHEM*Hello, 343 Industries, ...new friend. I guess. I'm so glad you're still riding off the success of other game developers... I guess. I was wondering when you'd be making a new Halo game that'd be different from the usual fanfare. I hear Halo Wars 2 was a nice hit, though. Congratulations-...What's that? You didn't make Halo Wars 2? ...Creative Assembly did? ...Oh. I see. How awkward.*HEAVY SIGH*So, yeah. Halo Wars? Good game. Definitive Edition on Steam? Good port. Runs smooth, looks great, has solid gameplay, and beautiful music. Well worth the price as this edition comes with all the DLC that was released. Unfortunately they seemed to have also kept the balancing issues from the original console version in the days after Ensemble Studios' unfortunate... ""retirement"". Mmm, yes.Thanks, Microsoft.I'll be honest, though. It's not the BEST strategy game to ever grace the world with its presence (seriously Ensemble, you could've done so much better). Games like Command & Conquer, Total War and Age of Empires are much better representatives of the genre and are, lets be honest here, much more successful ones at that. However, Halo Wars is not the WORST strategy game to ever be released either. It sits all nice and snuggly in the middle of the spectrum as it offers very basic level RTS gameplay mechanics. However, they are extremely functional and easy to understand and utilize. It is certainly, as so many others say (as much as I loathe to say it myself), a good introduction into the genre. But the lack of depth and features that the other RTS games previously mentioned have can potentially makes this a double-edged sword and drive people AWAY from the genre all-together.Still. I'm looking forward to playing Halo Wars 2. Creative Assembly makes good games. I love the Total War series. Much success....Ah, hell. I'll just come out with it.343, when will you actually make your OWN bloody Halo games for once? And I don't mean the current trilogy garbage that you've been spewing out lately, that heresy should not have ever seen the light of day. I mean new games within the uncharted territories of the Halo universe. Rather than continuing the story of past games, NOW is the perfect opportunity to EXPAND on previously established lore. Do what Bungie did with Halo 3: ODST, only give it more depth and have it focus on a regular Human like a Marine or the like. No ODSTs because they're OP. No, give us a perspective of Humanity's struggles throughout the Human-Covenant War by putting players into the meat grinder and showing just how hopeless the situation was for Humanity. Give us a more Human story. Or show a more in-depth perspective on the Covenant's side... Wait. No. Don't do that. The Covenant suck. Bloody Jackal snipers and their bloody beamy sniper rifles. I HAVEN'T FOGOTTEN, HALO 2. You suck, Bungie....I miss you.*sniff* Buy this game if you like casual Real-Time Strategy gameplay. *sob* It's good fun. *more pathetic sobbing*"

More classics that were previously locked into specific consoles should come to PC and should come to a platform that is used by a large number of people, such as Steam. But having played RTS games for many hours I cannot recommend this game. The features that would be considered standard, such as grouping and high unit diversity, are not here. If you are looking to relive some nostalgia with some friends and don't know too much about RTS games this will be a good fit. But the clunky unit collision that will stop units from moving in an open field, the lack of units and unit types, and the extreme simplicity of this game make it not up to par with the standard of RTS games today. Again, if you want to relive some childhood memories go for it. But after playing it myself I realize that some games should remain in your memory under a shroud of nostalgia. More classic IP's on Steam would be great, but hopefully they get some games that stand the test of time."

The game is an excellent port of the original 360 version, with the ability to increase your resolution to 3840x2160 and play at over 60FPS. A welcome addition to the original game, and a must-have for us members of the PC Master Race. Despite only having played for a couple of hours so far, the gameplay is smooth, and incredibly easy to learn. Even though the control scheme is overly simplified for an RTS game, I would still easily recommend this to anyone who has a love for the Halo franchise/lore, and who enjoyed playing endless hours of Age of Empires as a child.

It feels like halo, but there isn't enough to it. Not a bad game, just kind of empty, like tetris or something where it's the same thing over and over again.The controls take a long time getting used to and in some cases are blatantly very hard to use correctly (such as when trying to use healing or bombardment abilities). Hitting F while the human side willbring up healing menues and bombardment menus, which is absolutely neccessary to take down scarabs for instance, and a lot of this isn't taught anywhere so you end up having to learn it by mistake. You can end up stuck wondering why you can't win and then realize there's a secret button hidden somewhere; I still have no idea how to use elephants and get them to spawn troops, and I've googled it multiple times. Try altering the hotkeys on your keyboard to something more reasonable, as well as the controls as they are, are akward being ported from the X-Box to computer, I think. The balance is great, save for the Scarab (which by itself can break the game).Overall is a mediocre tactics game, but the artwork and atmosphere gets you in to the Halo world and it feels alright. 6/10 for gameplay, 8.5/10 for Halo graphics."

For example: I reported two bugs and about 24 hours later those bugs were fixed. Sure, it's not some super advanced RTS. It's actually pretty basic. But sometimes, basic is fun and this is one of those cases.I might be a bit biased since it's my first RTS that I got and played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of as a child while I was also able to understand english, so it wasn't like when I tested a few other RTS games and I had no clue what I was doing.Also, the cutscenes are pretty gorgeous, or atleast they were back in the day but they still hold up pretty great. The different hero units/commanders are similar to the other ones of their factions due to the fact that they are of the same faction, but they are definitely different enough.And a little tip for anyone who wants even minor advice for playing covenant: you might want to use a controller. two out of three hero units' abilities are a bit confusing due to how they work with keyboards and mice, while using a controller for them is really easy.So TLDR; I find the game fun, though it's basic and it was originally made for controllers so it plays best that way, though it's still a good port. Bug fixes and such aren't uncommon either so it's not scary to run into bugs since they're likely to be patched swiftly.Yes, I recommend this game, but it's understandable that some people wouldn't like it due to how basic it is and such.You should make up your own opinion and the game and purchase it if you think it will be fun.Have a good day, all!"

[60+ FPS on my 760 GTX2GB on Max settings 1080p]+The visual upgrade is fairly noticable when compared to the original 360 version, however maybe not a very huge leap but still pretty good enough.+M&K Controlls work pretty well.+Campaign is pretty well made and even features 2 player co-op+Very easy to get into for people new to RTS, some refer to it as ""Baby's first rts"" but that can be looked at both a positive and negative way, i tend to look at in a positive light since it's nice playing something more relaxing and simpler in the RTS genre for a change. All though the simplicity is mostly due to this game originaly being designed only for console, granted don't think then the game won't be a challange at times and then there's no strategy involved at all it's just simply not the near unforgiving levels of some rts games like Starcraft.+Server browser for multiplayer matches+Contains the DLCs they added in during the original's lifetime [Just some multiplayer modes and maps].+Only 20$+An RTS you can play with a controll fairly wellMixed Things :+/- Hotkeys do exists but a few are missing such as being able to tell units to leave a defensive structure, instead you gotta click on em, open the radial menu, move your mouse up and click again.Bad things :-UI was updated somewhat for M&K however a lot of elements are still designed around a controll such as having a radial menu being opened when  you click on a building.-If you're a hardcore RTS player who operates on the speed and strategy levels of a Korean SC pro player who's on crack cocaine, then you'll find Halo Wars to be far too simple and dull for you  since as i said it's a more simpler and easier RTS game when compared to most in the rest of the genra. Even games such as Dawn Of War and original older C&Cs are more complex.Overall, there's only very few problems  with this new updated definitive version of Halo Wars, and it finally brought the game to a platform where it feels more at home.Hopefully this is a sign that Halo Wars 2 will eventually soon pop up on Steam and maybe even some of the Halo FPS games. It would make sense to put them on Steam too instead of limiting them to the terrible and dead windows store but this is Microsoft, they've been messing up in the PC gaming space for a long time  however this is one of the few times they actually did a good call."

What could have been a decent game is let down in a number of ways however. Before you read any further understand that I am a campaign player when it comes to strategy games. I may dabble in skirmish but I will never play RTS multiplayer. Therefore if those things are important to you, read another review.In terms of the campaign itself, it is merely adequate, the missions aren't going to blow your mind but they are decent enough for the most part. I didn't finish the campaign because I have encountered a mission type that I absolutely detest, a timed mission. Having visited the forums, I have discovered that there are several missions of this type in the campaign as well as an escort mission, a mission type that should die a slow painful death. The acting is cringeworthy and not in a ""so bad, it's good"" kind of way that CnC used to do so well. Also, the campaign is quite short at only 15 missions.Another flaw I discovered while playing the campaign was unit pathfinding. It is laughably bad. The vehicles will get stuck and just stay in place if the game deems the passage too narrow. What you have to do then is move a few units individually to address this. It seems that the units are absolutely determined to avoid bumping into each other. That would have been commendable if they were drivers on a freeway but I think I would rather get a few scratches on my warthog than take the long way around to get blown up by the giant death laser. It may seem like a minor nitpick but babying your units in RTS is NEVER fun."

Made by the creators of Age of Empires, it was one of the first RTS games that were playable on console in my opinion. Even though it took microsoft 7 years and disbanding Ensemble Studios, they finally figured out that to make an RTS sell, means to bring it out on PC. Alas, now that the game is rather old and the interface was developed for console, it's kind of a pain to utilize sometimes. There isn't even an ESC button functionality, you HAVE to go to the top left corner and click a small button. Whatever the case, I'm happy they didn't charge full price for this, and now I can finaly play a game i've loved for many years with all of my friends, because nobody owned a 360 except for me, because consoles suck."

And now with the PC release its still just as good, even better with KB+M.Gameplay wise, it's very basic (Compared to Starcraft atleast) but that isnt a bad thing. Its a good game for new comers to RTS's. Both the Humans and Covenant play pretty much the same with some slight difference's between them, mostly depending on which commander you choose during Skirmish or Multiplayer.The port is very good, able to run it at a solid 60FPS with mostly max settings (no AA or Shadows)Overall, for $20 USD, you're getting around a 8-9 Hour single player, very basic, if not fun gamplay, and multiplayer."
,Recommended,459220,32741268,Posted: 24 June,all,Spades Neil,"I originally played this on the Xbox 360, and boy was it fun. Still is. The controls are generally ported over pretty well to a mouse and keyboard, barring one or two minor exceptions where it feels a bit odd.Or, you know, you could play this with a controller, which is actually surprisingly comfortable. This is the only game I've ever known to make an RTS work well on a console.If I am to view this objectively as if I were never exposed to the game before, and if I were to compare it to other RTS games already on PC, it's a little on the basic side by comparison, but it's still a great deal of fun, especially if you like Halo. Also it has a COOP story campaign so that's neat too.For someone who is new to real time strategies though, this game would probably be an excellent game to start with.tl;dr For $20 I'd say it's worth it."

I remember when I used to play Halo every other day, and when this game came out for the 360 my heart raced, I used to even watch the E3 trailer and presentation, I was so excited...I bet some people expect me to say it wasn't worth it, it was though, it was so worth it. This game taught me that you don't always need to be the low down tough and gruff guy doing all the shooting, you could see the action from a top down view and feel just as good as you would up close in the blood. And personally, this game hasn't lost it's touch, with mouse and keyboard controls, it's as if this game aged with me and I love it, now there's still the stupid control scheme for camera zoom (page up and page down) which I despise, I wish it was just the mouse wheel like every other RTS but I can forgive them for that seeing as they gave us the DLC reskins of the warthog and wraith, (which to be honest should never have been sold for actual money in the first place, it's two skins for five bucks..) but other than that they bumped up the graphics a bit and it really does look good, now it's not a remaster, far from it, but it certainly holds up for PC standards at least in my eyes.Gameplay?, you wanna know about gameplay? What's there to know, it's an RTS, you build the resource strcutures, raid resource areas, build up a ton of infantry at first then spit out mad amounts of vehicles towards the end with some special powers here and there.One issue I really have with this is the special powers, for example, the UNSC feel perfect, calling in MAC rounds to be fired from orbit, dropping carpet bombs etc. But the Covenant, on the Xbox 360 you controlled them, their hero unit was their special power, it felt like you were playing as that unit, something I never thought was possible at the time. But in this it feels a bit.. off, but it's minor at best. Few more tweaks and we've got us a propah smash em' brawl ere' lads!What would I rate this game AT LEAST 7/10 because blinded Nostalgia. and of COURSE 9/10 Because why not.I'm not the technical person who gets into the nitty gritty of these types of reviews, I just say it how I like it. You want technical stuff scroll up or down. For me?, this is a game I recommend and that's all I got.Did I mention there are Scarabs in this?"

Have you ever wanted to muster an army? Command an army to obliterate an enemy in intense combat? If so, this is the game for you.When you enter a game you're presented with an unbuilt base, from there you use what resources you're given to build the necessary infrastructure to help the production of your base and army.  Whist you're preparing your base and army, you can't help but feel vulnerable, you have no idea what your opponent(s) are doing. The uncertainty is a thrill, ""Will they attack?"" ""Do I need to work on my defence?"",""The enemy seems dorment, maybe I should attack now, but what if they launch a counter attack?""  Once you have concocted your battle plans and army, you may decide to launch an attack, as your army moves on, you know along the path you'll most likely come into contact with an army, you're feeling confident, your army is too big to be overwhelmed, but wait, you're minutes away from your base what if they launch an air attack that'll take you by suprise and leave you in a compromisable postion?  So many possibilities in a single round, this is what makes this game so fun.  You have to excersise all these possiblities, or you may die.  You gotta act as a true battle commander, you have to be quick smart or you'll perish.THINGS YOU MAY WANT KNOW.1. There are 2 factions in halo wars, UNSC and Covenant , there are 3 leaders on each side. Each faction offers a different style of playing, one not being a re skin of the other, despite these differences, they offer a fair playing field. Each leader in their corresponding factions will provide different​ factors such as specific units or passives skills. Overall providing a different but fair playstyle.2. Each map has its own layout and look so they all provide a different strategic advantage and/or diadvantage.3. If you're worried about out playing all the set difficulties, no need to worry, they have a difficulty called ""automatic"", which means everytime you win, your ""automatic"" score goes up, which will increase the difficulty, this will last a LONG time, always providing a challenge, suited to your skill level.4. The campaign is actually quite fun to play, especially if you're interested in the lore or have enjoyed any other Halo games. I haven't finished the campaign but so far it has been a blast, it isn't tedious at all and after every mission, you feel more invested into the storyline.Overall 8/10"

,Not Recommended,459220,32872679,Posted: 27 June,all,The Serious Man,"Alright, so I played this game back on the 360 and it was fantastic. My first RTS and it was Halo themed with great cinematics, decent enough AI to play against, and a steadily declining multiplayer due to the Ensemble fiasco. The campaign was alright, I eventually got every collectable and beat it on legendary with gold medals for each mission. I wasn't bored with it.That was then.Now the mechanics in the game have not aged well and Microsoft made a poor attempt at Keyboard controls being that they locked half of them from being altered. The mechanics I speak of are all based around unit controls. Selecting units and assigning controls groups are fine, but the unit movement is handicapped.When units are selected, you can assign a location for them to venture to with a movement order. They will then proceed to go to that location. Some of the units will even group up and travel together toward that location at uniform speed. However, if at any time you place a new movement order, they stall. If you repeatedly place movement orders, the units will repeatedly stall and move at a snails pace.This might seem like a silly detail to bring up, but when you've played Dota 2 for four years, it becomes a serious detriment.I would have kept the game and played it were it not for these issues I've listed...Oh... and before I forget, the pause key is defaulted to F10 instead of Escape...Why?"

I've been in it since day one and I've played and finished all the games with the exception of ODST which didn't work for me.When I saw this on PC I naturally thought ""Wow, I wasn't expecting this."" And bought it straight away thinking that it was going to be almost the same as it was on console. Needless to say, I got what I was expecting and then some. But there's some problems (And improvments) that I'll list below.It is brilliantly ported to PC and controls beautifully for an old game that was made on console. It looks amazing, everything has been updated splendidly. The sound design is on point and everything sounds exactly like you'd expect from Halo and the music is flawlessly 'Halo'. Every soundtrack sounds perfect for the Halo universeHowever the main flaw and it's biggest downfall is it's multiplayer. 343 (or Microsoft) has done away with the matchmaking system for Halo Wars and replaced it with a generic lobby browser which is worsened by the insanely low playerbase. Nearly no one is playing this game. (At my last check there was 454 players. How strange...)This wouldn't be a problem if people were actually playing it, but as is, there's nobody playing a game that has very little replay value in the campaign mode after you've finished it once. And it's for this reason that I've requested a refund and am also not reccomending it. If you're thinking of getting this for the campaign and maybe to play Co-op then by all means go for it. But if you're after a new RTS and craving multiplayer, don't get it. It's dead on arrival."
,Not Recommended,459220,32159512,Posted: 3 June,all,Jedianakinsolo,"I've got ""No"" selected because I feel that as an RTS, this game is really not that great.  It can't stand up to any of the heavyweights like Company of Heroes or even starcraft because it simply doesn't have the depth of play that even most low-tier RTSs have.  If you're a HALO die hard, pick it up, but it's only saving grace at release was that it had almost no competitors in it's Genre on the Xbox.  Now that it's on PC where the RTS genre actually exists, it's obvious that the game has less depth than Clash of Clans.  It's an enjoyable game a few times through but it boils down to spam resource centers and one production center of choice, then whatever the best unit is for you.  Done.

Instead, both are far clunkier, mostly because they were origionally optomised to play with a controler. You CAN play it with a controler, but as with most strategy games made for consoles, those controls are also a little clunky and awkward."

For me, I have always been an avid fan of the Halo franchise but relieving this on Steam now is a fresh good memory. Although Halo started off as a FPS, Ensemble Studios managed to convert the franchise into a creative and fun RTS game. Even though the battles are only on land, the game is still good coming with a interesting storyline campaign and AI skirmish battles. Multiplayer modes are fun and challenging. I recommend grabbing a bunch of your friends and use teamwork to utilize the best strategies. Keep in mind though, the controls may feel weird considering that this game was originally designed for use by consoles. But luckily, settings are adjustable to your fit!"

There are sadly many other issues too. The line of site is ridiculous for a game that doesn't include any sort of radar, or real ability to zoom out, and forget about using powers such as the mac gun as the moment you finish dragging it to where you are trying to hit, your unit or base is already dead and you lose the ability to fire.

They released it with better visuals and all the content it had for $20? ON PC?? Hell yes! I believed I would enjoy it as much as I had originally, but to my disappointment. I've played many games since then, obviously. I'm older now and my tastes have refined. I don't remember how it played exactly, but I suppose my expectations have gone above what the game can do now.1) Camera. I'm accustomed to camera views such as seen in the Total War line up. I can see my entire army from a high vantage point and react accordingly to any enemy movement. Not so with this, for obvious reasons. My memory of the camera view is higher than what the game currently has. Entirely my fault.2) UI. When I hard group units, I can't see the group, let alone the type and number of units in the group. We have the ability to group our units, but not see them? It becomes tedious having to press each group key each time I have casualties. Group 1: No casualties. Group 2: 1 unit dead. Group 3: 1 unit dead, 2 wounded. Replace dead units in 2 &3. Rinse and repeat for further dead units and groups.3) This is what♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off rather than just being irksome. Units going off to fight on their own. They don't stay where I wish them to. I want some soldiers to stay in the back to watch the flanks, but still remain in firing range of the frontliners. Won't happen. They all clump up in one area trying to kill a pack of Grunts.I know I haven't played the PC port much, but just these issues leads me to believe I won't be able to accept them as just part of the game. I'd rather just delete a game to save space than be frustrated. It's not my cup of tea. Unfortunately, there is only Like/Dislike, no in-between.

There are other little bugs here and there as well but nothing worth complaining about, so until they fix THIS major bug, I’m not fixing this review from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. WHEN they do fix this bug, then sure, I’ll change it to a thumbs up hoping they come out with some DLC of other characters (which probably won’t happen). What ya see is what ya get most likely.TL;DR Thumbs down because of a game breaking bug: your cursor randomly disappears while playing and for an RTS that is an automatic match loss for you in game."

So, you get to know each units, and their good against and weak against, basically you have to use some sort of tactics as well, like having vehicles taking dmg while infantry helping behind.It's also very interesting that you can upgrade a tons of stuff for your units, making them from weak weenies to Strong GO AHEAD TRY ME bad boys. Of course, WHO CAN FORGET ABOUT THE CORE AND MOST BADDIES IN THE GAME? The Spartans. They're very flexible and strong, nearly an one man army, EMPHASIZED ON NEARLY. Because they still need other units to help them.Besides that, you get to spend supplies that either build more stuff for your base, or upgrade stuff for your units, or give power-ups like Fix or Transportation. But, rather spending supplies on transportation, I prefer to have transport ships as units like those in Red Alert and StarCraft series.Now now, talking about goodies, let's talk about why it is so garbage. THERE ARE NO BUTTONS to tell your units to stop where they're, and their ability hotkeys are VERY CONFUSING. Sometimes they even walk directly toward enemies when you want your units to fight them. And their path finding are SUPER DUPER AWFULLY DESIGNED GARBAGE. Your units ARE SO CLUMSY AND STUPID, EVEN USING VEHICLES OR AIRCRAFTS. They're SOOOOO stupid and clusmy like they forgot how to walk or pilot and drive their vehicles.And the most unfair and unforgivable BS is, SUPER DUPER STRONG TANKY ENEMY BOSSES THAT CAN TAKE A TONS OF BEATINGS. Like that cursed  Scrub, I tell you, that misison really made me nearly want to punch my monitor. I constantly lost units because of the DUMB PATH FINDING TRASH. And god damned thing took a while to kill while you have nowhere to run and hide during the combat. You'll get to see some of your ""Baiting"" units die thanks to stupid useless path finding in the game.DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT LET YOUR SERGEANT IDIOT GET BLOWN AWAY FROM HIS LASER CAR. He'll be very useless and garbage as enemies with energy swords can like put him into coma within seconds, and he cannot get back to any Warhogs.And last thing, VERY VERY VERY UNACCEPTABLE AND UNFORGIVABLE. Bugs, and glitches. I had one so far which is okay, but it just happened in the middle of game which I am about to finish it. AND THEN BLACK SCREEN, YOU GOT STUCK IN THE CINEMATIC MODE. Son of a .... WITCH.But still, I would NOT recommend this,  even if this has co-op camapign, unique co-op mechanics that is so alien for me since I play RA and SC most of time. Cool, but sucked as this game only just want you stop playing it due to its stupid path-finding for your units. Trust me, you'll lose a tons of them before you even know what's going on."

While the graphics are a tad outdated they are by no means terrible, gameplay is simple and straight forward, anyone can pick up, play, and have fun. With that said, if challange is your thing, legendary will give even the most veteran players a hard time.Throw in multiplayer, Skulls (like Grunt Birthday Party, or Sickness for extra Difficulty), Deep lore, a good story, and you have a really fun and simple RTS that you can spend hours in.I highly suggest this game, and at 20 dollars US its a steal.

The multiplayer, while not the most in depth rts is enjoyable and I see myself playing it a lot in the future.

I played the absolute hell out of the game that I managed to ruin the disc, re-bought the game, and kept going.

If your a Halo fan and an RTS fan I recommend this game to you. It's story is up there in the halo universe, the soundtrack is amazing, graphics, though it's a port from a 360, are actually pretty good though you can change them much.

The UI is also very much a console UI but does work well with PC.I believe that this is the start of something big. On E3 we WILL see a Halo 3 anniversary (or at least MCC), I guarantee it. 343 are terrible liars so don't believe them for a second, they said the same exact thing about Halo Wars 1 on PC and H2A on XBone.

The game does have it's own identity and truly does feel like a Halo game. Resource Management is fairly simple, and the amount of units you can control is tiny compared to what I'm used too, but it all makes up for it with the combat and building.The Campaign is probably the best part about the game. The CGI cutscenes still look outstanding by today's standards, and the characters are pretty decent if a little generic, (Sergeant Forge is the wisecracking macho Marine stereotype, Anders is the stuck-up Doctor/professor), yeah it does get a little tiresome. But those cutscenes and the storyline hook them all together perfectly.The combat is a runner-up in the best features. You need to have a good mix of Power/Supplies, and Heavy/Light troops in order to find that sweet spot in the battle. You can't send in twenty Scorpions and expect to bring down a base, as you'll most likely be countered by Banshees or Hunters which can take you out fairly quickly. All in all, the game is decently balanced unless the enemy has saved up enough supplies and just spams ODST drops at you.Great game, and a great port."

There isn't a large variety of troops nor buildings like other RTS games however each one has their own unique purpose and needs in battle. When it comes to strategy, there's some in-depth thought of either defending or attacking but not enough to truly give a sense of mix ideas against a player.  Most of the time it's either a spam of a strong troop to destoryed the enemy however sometimes this gives a player the sense of fear of being pushed against a corner which in turn leads to a back up strategy plan. Not the best RTS out there but decent enough for a simplistic form of an RTS for newcomers who are interested in getting into the RTS genre. Fun, simple and enjoyable."

They may have had good intentions to stop the enemies coming through, but in reality they messed my attack up and it cost a lot more to succeed.2) After the above happened, for some reason my cursor was no longer visible and I closed the game for a while as a result.Other than those two things, the game is fun but you do have a low population limit."

Yes, you can say its toned down but your opponents are also handicapped by its shortcomings. It doesnt have the depth of AOE or Starcraft but its a very enjoyable game with its own twist on how you upgrade your units and even build your bases.Campaign is really good for an RTS and this is a really good port. My only issue is theres no matchmaking and its all custom lobbys.I hope this is microsofts way of finally realizing that most people would prefer to buy their games on steam instead of using the Windows store, now they just need to let people with the Windows 10 version play with the steam version.Unless you want to be able to play on an Xbox as well with your friends I reccomend this version over the Windows 10 version."

,Recommended,459220,31364264,Posted: 25 April,all,Goob✅,"I hate the new Halo trilogy. I hate Microsoft. But I want my old Halo games on Steam, so I had to support this.Halo Wars was and still is a great game. Although its development p­issed off Bungie because Microsoft went behind their backs, Ensemble was respectful to the story and worked with Bungie to make it sensible. It's a shame Microsoft destroyed Ensemble's budget, forced them to lay off so many people during development, and killed them after release. I am glad Bungie left. And I am glad to play this great game again, AND on PC from Steam!The FOV is a bit small and zoomed in, but this can be fixed with cheat engine.The port is solid with only a few bugs existing, like the mouse cursor disappearing. This can be fixed with a restart.The gameplay is simple, but that is what made it great on console. You can have sandbox fun with all your favorite units from the Halo story, with a few extras to boot.The story is on point. Although it's a one off, I think this is good because had the game failed it wouldn't have affected the main story at all. You follow three characters: Captain Cutter of the UNSC Spirit of Fire (a colony ship modified for war), Professor Anders (protige and rival to Dr. Catherine Halsey), and Sgt. Forge (badass Marine and who Bungie would base Spartan-II Jorge on). They attempt to defeat the Covenant in their attempts to unlock Forerunner secrets found within the ancient structures on Harvest.(I respect Ensemble for keeping the story in its own little section versus games like Halo 4 and Halo 5 which resurrected a dead [finished according to Bungie] story, put it on life support, and butchered a lot of great characters in what people claim to be ""they finally added character and story to the Halo games"". Even if that added character and story means turning the confident and walking tank that is Chief into a depressed, asocial emo guy who magically forgot all his friends, a Cortana going through menopause and rampancy [again], as well as the UNSC still warring with the Elites, and the Forerunners hating both the humans [their legacy] and the Precursors [their predecessor role models].)p.s. Halo was originally meant to be an RTS similar to Myth. Even though a lot of fans already know this, somehow many more forget. So imagine this as a what could have been."

76561198018598933,Recommended,459220,31326574,Posted: 23 April,all,mangamastermind,"Halo Wars finally comes to the PC. It took it 8 years, but at long last it’s where RTS’ thrive and belong, Right? Well, mostly.The short version of this review is simple. The game is good, plays very much like the original did on the Xbox 360 eight years ago. The game is very well balanced game play wise, and things generally flow very well from one combat to another. If your looking for a toned down, casual RTS that’s good starting point to jump into, then this is your game. But be advised, there are some hang ups.It bears repeating that this game was built for Xbox 360, and playing it shows. While the game has been ported with drag box system for your mouse curser, which allows you to accurately select units, and double clicking allows you to select all your units of one type, which was not in the original game, a lot of features not common to RTS’s are present. Namely scrolling to zoom out the map is not supported here, as it was in the original title. In addition there appears to be no way to group units threw normal Ctrl+ number groupings, though the game does support a “jump to army” feature, or bases, which might be a hurdle for some RTS players.Also be prepared to learn the hot keys to this game. Selecting local units, all units, using your armies abilities, and your global abilities (Such as Mac rounds or ODST drops) are a must to learn quite rapidly. Precision is not this games strong suit having been designed for consoles, and while mobbing your enemy and using army group abilities on a single target like a base or super unit is viable, when you want hero units like Spartans to steal vehicles, you’re going to have to be meticulous and very quick to select your Spartan and get to that enemy before your army blows it up. The game “fixes” this by tying one unit group in an army to your scroll wheel, which again, is a bit of a stretch to learn and adapt too.But again the game is extremely well balanced. Limiting resources to two (Research level, and supplies) allows for quicker tactical planning since both can be effectively either managed at your base(s), or found around the map at strategic locations. Various areas of the map have special resource nodes, defensive structures, or even light bridges or light walls to block troop movement. Which ultimately for people playing competitively is a massive plus and helps to allow for a better experience overall.So while the game has some fumblings with the port, I don’t think it’s flawed in any way. Fans of halo will like the game, even if the story is a bit barebones and filled with sarcastic wit, and fans of RTS’ and competitive games will like it for the balanced game play. I don’t play multiplayer for halo wars, so I can’t speak for the matchmaking system. Overall though, for 20 bucks, it’s definitely a game you should at least look at and maybe add to your collection."

It may be less complex than it's genre brethren but as a die hard Halo fan I could not pass this up. I have only played about an hour so far and everything seems great.I just have one critique. The game doesn't allow you to rebind all the controls. You can rebind some but not anywhere near most or all of them. This, is a cardinal sin in any port. I hope it gets fixed in a future patch.But the game runs great and the fact that control binds is my biggest pet peeve seems to indicate that this is a mostly solid porting job. Great game. Good port. All the original DLC is thrown in there too and let's not forget no need for Xbox Live.I recommend Halo Wars: Definitive Edition."

Huge facepalm for not getting this game when i had a 360. runs well after a few tweaks to the grapics for my potato of a laptop and still looks really good. Gameplay is fun. watching Vultures wrek stuff with missle pods is very satisfying.

YesBefore starting I would just like to outline that even though I haven't played this extensively on Steam I have clocked roughly 70 Hours on the Xbox 360 version many moons ago! So that will also form the basis for this review. Enjoy.Positives- Simplistic style, would act as a good starter for those new to the strategy genre- Good variety of units accessible by certain characters based on what the user chooses- Its release in 2009 would suggest that it has aged incredibly well, aesthetically is very pleasing- The graphics have been updated from the Xbox 360 version- Includes all DLC from the original edition as seen on consoles- Engaging campaign, which I feel is a great edition to the Halo series- Ability to play as both Covenant and UNSC offering different perspectives from both sidesNegatives- Dissapointing difficulty system (Lacks an inbetween difficulty) / This will likely vary from player to player- Unit inbalancing, Covenant Scarab is easily obtained and very few units can withstand it effectively making Covenant a better choice- Its simplicity, although a positive, can be seen negaively by some more familiar strategy players. The inability to have larger amounts of units and not being able to set up bases anywhere can leave users feeling somewhat restricted- Very few maps, 18 in total, but some cannot be accessed in certain scenarios. For instance, 4 of those maps are only available for 3v3 games, and 7 maps for 2v2 and 1v1.ConclusionI recommend Halo Wars to you if you enjoy a more simplistic playstyle, but be warned there are a few restrictions in the game which might leave you unsatisfied, especially if you are coming from much more familiar titles suc as Supreme Commander, Ashes of the Singularity, Planetary Annihilation and Stellaris.Thanks for Reading!"
,Recommended,459220,33912223,Posted: 30 July,all,EpicHD,"When the original Halo Wars released on the xbox 360, I was an instant fan. Now with a port to PC, I thought I would give it a try. There has been a small amount of upgrades since the Xbox 360 version such as an unlocked framerate and slightly better visuals. I personally think this game is worth it's price tag (£15.99). I would recomend this game to people old and new to the RTS genre and the Halo series."

,Recommended,459220,34266328,Posted: 15 August,all,calibrojosh10,"What I liked:A Halo game on PC and it’s a strategy gameA great story for fans of the Halo seriesA simple strategy gameWhat You Need to Know:Some may fault the game for being simple, it is. The game doesn’t live up the standards of PC strategy games. This is good for those looking for a casual game that doesn’t require a lot of learning to play. This also means it doesn’t have depth that will make it last.The campaign is good enough to warrant the buy if you care about the halo series at all, otherwise skip the game. You get great cut scenes that are still good, a great soundtrack, and memorable characters like Forge, Anders and Cutter. The missions you take are varied enough with the 8 hours you won’t get bored with tasks of defending locations, people, varying starting strength, tech, and heros.The game has a good amount of modes even after the solo campaign. You can replay the campaign in co-op, use skulls ( a staple of the halo series) for added insanity, or ease. You have skirmish modes up to 6 total people with even teams of any mix of AI or people with different modes to play, normal, deathmatch ( lots of money, all techs), tug of war and capture the flag. ( Online is only normal mode btw)The map choice is very slim if you go 3v3 with only 4 maps. 1v1 able to use any of the maps offering over 10 maps. There are enough variety in the maps though, with some offering tech, healing or money stations to hold or take from the enemy with walls and teleporters and different amount of bases you can place on the map too.The game is not at all balanced for anyone that will play the game enough to learn that the rock paper scissors mechanics is very shallow. Different factions have blatantly better units, like flamethrowers vs jackals. One snipes while the other has to get so close. The game has cheesy early game tactics with varying degree of success rate, like warthog, mac or brute rushes. You have hard counters within the rock paper scissors that aren’t as powerful as other factions too. (ODST vs tanks)  And certain groupings of units are hard to counter if you pick the wrong faction. What I’m trying to say is the game is very shallow and doesn’t have the balance or depth to be taken as a  serious strategy game.The multiplayer player base is insanely small. Most of the time you won’t be able to find more than 1 game running if you’re lucky. Weekends and times when most people would be home will increase your odds. You do get 6 choices of commanders that give you a unique ability and some units that are the reason to play said commanderThe game doesn’t have basic attack formations, unit facing, some key bindings can’t be rebound. This will sometimes having you fighting the game with wanting more to be able to finesse your army, or having bigger armies since the base unit caps only allow armies no bigger than 25 of basic units or less with more advanced units( with some mixes having a lot less)Overall if you’re new to strategy games or want a more laid back not micro heavy style of game this game will be good. If you’re looking for depth or a well-balanced game skip.  It is fun to play around with scarabs, ODSTS and the different units that are unique to the halo franchise.  You can still see that the port wasn’t all that great in controllability that PC users are used to from other games, even within simpler strategy game down belowMy Score:BPaid: $20Completed in: 8 hoursGames similar I recommend:Creeper World series  (easy to learn)Particle Fleet ( simple yet has depth)Lambda Wars ( Half life strategy game)Ultimate General: Civil War ( simple controls)Tooth and Tail (looks casual and not out yet)"

,Recommended,459220,33208636,Posted: 3 July,all,Jazzer,"So I played a hell of a lot of Halo Wars on the XBOX360, so takey review with a pinch of biased table salt.For £15 you cant really complain, the campaign is fun, still gives me goosebumps and the cut scenes stand up well. The gameplay is simple, it was for consoles its going to be simple but never the less fun. I have only completed the campaign as I don't have time to full dig into all the other modes, but if the multiplayer works it'll be fun especially 4v4, skirmish modes are ok, you're just against the AI.If you can pick this game up on sale I would definitely say buy it, but if you buy it full price you won't be disappointed, also its Halo.I must state that this games Mulitplayer is DEAD."

,Recommended,459220,34531420,Posted: 27 August,all,Coopziana,"Having played through a handful of levels in the Campaign I have to say I'm disappointed with this game. Perhaps is because I have played many Strategy Builder Games (the likes of C&C, The Settlers, Age of Empires etc.etc..).The building and construction aspect of this game is exptremely limited and requires no real strategy to actually winning levels, it's all just a case of beating the time gate and pumping out as many units as you can to send them into battle and spam the objective.It's worth a look in if you are looking for a strategy game that requires little brain power and straight forward tactics for lots of bangs and booms. But this game is not really something I would devote a lot of time to."

An amazing job done by the porting team; I hope they keep it up as there is still a lot of work to be done. Andon another note, I hope they get upgraded servers to support a completely random matchmaking like the original Halo Wars has, the current just removes the random element from it and I can say with 100% accuracy that this game would be played a lot more on PC if it had said MM."
