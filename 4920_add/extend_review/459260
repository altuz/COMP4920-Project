,Recommended,459260,22304209,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,A Frackin Cylon,"I played a bunch of the archery game from the lab, loved it, decided I needed more, and bought this. I am not at all dissapointed. The game is fantastic, and I'm sure it will give me plenty of playtime. It has 5 modes: Target practice, challenge, free shoot, endless, and juggling (where you try to keep apples in the air by continually shooting them). All of them feel great, and the game provides useful stats at the conclusion like accuracy, arrows fired, score and grade. The one complaint I have is that I wish it had some kind of a high score tracker - it doesn't need to be complex, but just some way of comparing your results against previous trials. That beign said, this is a great, well-polished archery game.EDIT: The dev implemented scoreboards, rejoice!"

The environment is pretty simple and the gamemodes are a little limited right now but what's there works really well, mechanically. The high score board keeps you coming back for more, trying to beat other people's scores as well as improve your own. The presentation is charming, the bow mechanics are excellent, and with more content & modes this will easily be the best archery experience for VR."

Feels like a gimmicky game trying to cash in on the new VR market with a 'just finished enough to pass' game.Handling of the bow and items is wrong, it warps the the hand of the person, you can't move around (walking or teleporting) or i just couldn't figure it, there is only one area/map and you do everything inside of it.Game modes are basically, shoot targets, shoot targets but with limited arrows, shoot targets against a clock, shoot apples, or shoot anything you want.I like the Lab version of archery, it has a little subsistence to it where you have to protect a castle. This is just shooting a bow.I also found out it's not very finished on the gameplay side as i could hold and nocked arrow against the string and throw the bow away from me while still holding the arrow. When you let go the arrow fires as normal through the arrow rest.I would not recommend this game, I would just play the Lab instead."

It has several modes. All of which are boring. Shoot stationary targets within a time limit; shoot stationary targets without a time limit; shoot an arrow at an apple repeatedly, and shoot ONE stationary target lots of times. There is no real GAME here. You have the protential in a VR game to throw in some random crazy fun stuff, and you didnt. Archery is fun. I know this because i do archery IRL and its great. This really isnt. You cant even enjoy attempting to master it as the controls are terribly poor. Overly complex given the simplistic nature of 'Bowslinger', meaning you miss fire or fail to load your bow far too often.Given the potential of the medium, this is just massively underwhelming and the bearest excuse of a game. If you want bow and arrow goodness use 'The Lab' or for gun and fun shooty goodness, have a look at VR Skeet, also free on Steam, and is able of how make stuff fun and entertaining if not realistic.TL;DR - Save your money and play the minigame in 'The Lab'. Much more entertaining."

It's actually kinda like pacman. A bit repetitive and only score based.Have fun for a couple hours or so."
,Not Recommended,459260,23498261,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,Cyrix,"I really enjoy VR archery games and bought this without hesitation. Unfortunately, there's not a lot to it, and even though I really like VR archery I got bored pretty quickly. The devs claimed they were working on an action mode, but now are totally silent on the subject, so there's not much to recommend at present. At least it's cheap."

But its more of a demo vs a game worth paying more than $5 for. It gets boring quick, the only reason I have more than 10 minutes played is because my little brother has a fun time with it."

Same enviroment the entire game, you can't even move out of the starting spot. Same patterns every round, game is more about memorizing than archery.Soundtrack consists of a single track.You can't really aim because it makes you want to place draw string to your face, but you have a headset on so you bash your controllers a lot.There are better and cheeper archery games out for Vive. Why buy this one?graphics: 4/10sound: 2/10replayability: 1/10fun: 1/10Only game I ever refunded."
,Not Recommended,459260,22360002,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,g-DOH,Bought it because of the positive reviews.... after 10-15 minutes or so there was nothing to do. sure it works and it is challenging to play but not engaging because there is no story or even scenario... this is just target practice.The lab is much more fun to do in it's simplicity

,Not Recommended,459260,24233915,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,madman,"I did not enjoy playing this game at all.  I would consider this game as a nice experiment in VR, but it has very little value as a game.  While the developers might improve it, nothing I've seen so far indicates that they're likely to convert this into a high quality title (though I could definitely be wrong, its just my feeling about it).- 1 of 10 stars when compared to all other games, including AAA games not made for Vive/VR.- 1 of 10 stars when compared to all other Vive games (available today).- $0 recommended value if the game does not improve much beyond its current state as of 7/10/2016."

Threre's something about hearing the early stages of The William Tell Overture played too...It's not that it is a bad game but there are other archery games on VR which provide more of a dynamic challenge.For now its a thumbs down.

The bow mechanics feel nice, the graphics are nice, and it's a more relaxed alternative to other Vive archery experiences. The devs seem to be listening and adding features too, which should be encouraged. For £11 you can't go wrong."

It's a blast to just play with the physics and see how things react when you shoot them. I'm excited to try the new game mode when it comes out. I got exactly what I was hoping for out of this game. That being said I'm not opposed to more modes of play in future updates.
