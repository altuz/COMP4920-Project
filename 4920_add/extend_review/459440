,Not Recommended,459440,23338150,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,Bad Whippet,"What is it?Tower 3D is an Air Traffic Controller game aimed towards the casual end of the 'simulator' genre of games.  It's no ATC2 or Global ATC (and doesn't pretend to be), but it's not a lightweight time management game like Airport Madness either.  Tower 3D is aiming for a very neglected middle ground for ATC sims, so I had huge hopes for this one!However, I'm disappointed at the missed potential here.  It didn't need to do anything different (all the basics for an excellent casual game are right there) but it should have done them all so much better!  Here's a list of the good and bad stuff so you can decide for yourself:What's to like?It's a fun presentation of ATC (ie not just a radar screen) for people new to the genreA basic tutorial mode is providedAircraft strips have plenty of details about speed, direction, attitude and altitudeThere is flexibility to type specific commands as well as click pre-defined instructionsThe game offers 3D views of the planes taking off and landingWhat's not to like?The graphics are really bad.  I have the game running on the 'Fantastic' setting using an nvidia Titan Black, but here aretwo example screenshots(recommended that you view full-size) that are far from 'fantastic' with jagged lines and muddied textures.There are no free-camera options whatsoever - you can only zoom in slightly and have no control over the direction of view, and the camera frequently gets stuck pointing at nothing until the next plane arrives which can take a whileIt's missing some basics such as 'holding short' of the runway, expediting aircraft, accounting for wind factor and suchPlanes inexplicably stop and wait - and wait more - before carrying out a take-off commandOnly the ground controller role is simulated (there's no tower, approach or departure gameplay)All commands are read by the same voice - there are no 'radio' voice recordings for different pilots (totally immersion breaking)The GUI leaves a lot to be desired with windows that are difficult to resize or reposition for a better fit, and various buttons in dire need of basic tooltip descriptionsNo manual to explain more detailed optionsIt feels very unfinished - a sentiment echoed in nearly all reviews so far.  Maybe it was released to an unforgiveably tight deadline, in which case, hopefully the developers will be able to relax a little and start the polishing this game needs.Should you buy it?Hard to say.  If the developers voice intentions to improve it, then there IS a good game lying beneath all the faults.  Right now though, and without that commitment, £22 (current price) is just too high for the quality offered.  It's not an Early-Access title so (unless FeelThere declare otherwise) there has to be the assumption that no further improvements will happen.  As a result, I find it hard to recommend - yet wish I could because this exact game is needed badly on PC.  Hopefully, it will be improved and polished, and if that happens, I will adjust this review accordingly.Some alternatives to look for:CasualAirport Madness!  (stupidly fun, casual time-management game)IntermediateATC3* (pitched at the same level as Tower 3D)SeriousATC2 (vintage, but still current and the most serious ATC to date)Global ATC ('new kid on the block' but has a free playable demo you can try)______________* ATC3: I Am An Air Traffic Controller (its full title) can only be bought as a full product from Technobrain (in Japanese only).  For international gamers, there are fan-made English versions of ATC3 for download from the web. Note that ATC3 is in no way similar to the much more serious title ATC2."

The AI is rubbish, the visuals are from 10 years ago, the SP1 is released 3 weeks ago, but not on steam. Just avoid here. If you really have to, then get the product from devs directly.The product offers only 3 odd airports: one on remote island with almost no traffic - pretty miserable, then one from LA which is a huge step up from the first one, and 3rd which is totally uninteresting, and similar size as the second (KLAX)."
76561198031533411,Recommended,459440,33272005,Posted: 5 July,all,Mike Sholo,"I just bought the game recently, after reading all the reviews posted on Steam, which were not very good. English is not my mother tongue, so my apologies in advance about it.I'm not very demanding about the graphic quality (in fact, I play in medium configuration level, just imagine) and find them acceptable for the price of the game. I agree that they are not the last generation, but by the type of game and the price, I see them appropriate.I am not a reviewer, but since SP2 was added, in which they have solved most of the problems users complained about months ago and because nobody has dared to make a positive assessment, I have decided to publish this comment.The game has some high hardware requirements, but to medium configurations it runs well and I have not found any bugs. The game is user friendly and the learning curve is simple. I have played a lot of ATC games and although this is not the most professional I have tried, it is nice to be able to play without having to write endless cryptic commands. In addition, compared to most, obviously (and despite the low quality some complain), the graphical interface is very nice. It is not a professional game, but casual instead, and funny.Here, some suggestions about my experience in this kind of games. Most should be easy to implement in a future SP:- I will love to have a blinking PAUSE signal when I have the game paused.- A skipping time button when you found your airport with no planes till the next strip together with (not instead) the accelerated time.- Keyboard shortcuts for the commands. I mean, after you click in a plane or plane strip and get the callsign, would be lovely that the commands were numbered and you can press 1 for “Taxi to”, 2 for “Cleared for”, etc… and later 1, 2 or 3 again for the second row of orders (Runways if you had choose “Taxi to”, for example). The use of the ENTER key as ""Send"" would also be advisable.- Random time inside the choices of time selection.- The manual is not extensive and little help for the new players. Explaining that the ""Escape"" key is the one used to exit/finish the scenario would also be useful.- Some tool tips on the plane strip would be lovely and helpful when you leave the mouse over the information strip. What I mean is information on what it means everything in that strip. (Indicative, airplane class, transponder, destination, ...)- About the above, having a flight plan projected on departing planes, or destinations on the radar, could help to avoid the near miss between the departing aircraft.- Some way to restart the escenario without going to the main menu.- Aircraft should warn the tower when they are waiting to cross a runway. I never have got that communication from the pilots and they could be there forever.- Any warning sound when penalties happens would be charming also.- And the zoom… Yes! The zoom. It is a great idea to have only the control tower view to do things realistic, but some airports are huge, and it is too dificult to see everything properly. In a take of queue it is very dificult to know which plane is first to give it clearance, and some planes are holding their movement so far away that sometimes you can’t see if they are moving or not. And there is no any way to know their situation by radio contact either.- Oh! And some way to save the ingame windows forever in any scenario that you play. Having to resize every time that you play is a little bit annoying.I really miss the wind changes too."

Considering how much development was made throughout Tower 2011, you would have thought those developments would be the bare minimum in the new release...unfortunately not the case. I became instantly irritated at the game after the absolutely atrocious lack of control in regards to audio. The music is infuriating, and there was no way to turn it off without muting the entire game. The tutorial was lacklustre, and provided no real insight into the operations of ATC for anybody new to the aviation world. There were numerous bugs, including aircraft landing on a runway and somehow colliding with aircraft that were on the parallel taxiway, which were en-route to the holding point ready for departure. The whole feel of the game is just wrong. The heavily advertised ""3D"" element to the new release is rather boring too. Aircraft pushing back through scenery, awfully simple modelling, and a seemingly random way of switching views that the user has absolutely zero control over.For the price, this game is absolutely disgusting. I highly suggest spending your money on something complete, this is not even close to completion."

This is based on a very short stint (the tutorial, plus a few minutes outside of the tutorial).  So with that qualification:While the premise is promising and there is definitely potential, the game has a very unfinished feel to it.  The very first tutorial aircraft I encountered pushed back from the the St. Thomas terminal like a proper airliner... wow, neat.... except for the fact that it was a Cessna.  OK then.  Then on the GA ramp that typically would have hosted the Cessna, a Dash 8 type turboprop taxiied right though the farm of its fellow turboprops to get to the taxiway.  The game took a slight hit to suspension of disbelief there.  And the Cessna thing seemed pretty darned obvious to me.Rushed.  But could be fixed.Pros: Promising mechanics, aircraft behave more or less as they should when commanded.Cons: Rudimentary graphics and textures.  Aircraft movement is not terribly smooth.  View control is poor; zoom functionality is not terribly effective.This has the potential to be a really good and engaging sim, but it's not there yet.My advice - buy it to support the developer and encourage them to keep working on it.  Try it out.  You'll probably be disappointed.  But come back in 6 months and I expect (or hope) that it will be signficantly improved from its launch state."

,Not Recommended,459440,23354430,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Scar,"Ok well. I had high hopes for this one. Put in just under 4 hours before getting frustrated. This product suffers from a serious case of ""Unfinished"" feel. So many issues with a game that has such enormous potential, but seems to have been rushed to release. I cleared my runway of arrivals and departs only for the camera to be stuck on the last depart until another aircraft checked in. In the mean time, I'm staring at empty sky watching a jet leave my view with absolutely no way to change the camera focus to something else at the airport or terminals. A free camera mode seems to be mandatory, but totally absent from the game. There also seems to be a total lack of a manual available here on steam, or even at the web site link.While I can command the aircraft to change direction to avoid a mid air collision, there is no click menu option to change the altitude of an aircraft in flight, nor to assign one at take off. Flight strips also seem to be incomplete. While I'm use to the aircraft strips in Global ATC, this seems to make the Tower 3D version to be lacking useful information.The game can have a lot of down time where you wait for something to happen. It would be nice to be able to change density of the traffic.Sound effects of engines speed up and shut down are seriously cheesy. Even engine sounds in Airport Madness 3D are better. The computer voice acknowledgments of commands or check ins are also not polished. Traffic commands are not repeated or excepted in industry standard format, so just don't quite make it believable.Sure seems like an early access game, not a polished simulation. For $29.99 with the future of pay to play DLC, and the additional cost for the PRO version, I can not recommend it. Maybe when/if it becomes polished or at least having the feeling of being complete.EDIT - 6-15-2016 - Ok, I now have about 21 hours in this game. There are graphic bugs with planes parking in terminals, spinning 360 degrees over and over to finally stop in odd and unparked positions. Planes commanded to line up and wait, will spin 360 degrees in under 1 second as it turns onto the runway. If you fast forward time to get through a boring night, could find a bug where traffic just doesn't happen. I waited almost 12 ""control hours"" at one point waiting for new traffic to finally end up quitting the game.I have a better grip on the ""undocumented functions"" of the game, still no manual available that I can find. The camera button will stop the annoying camera change focus. That's good. Again, I love this kind of game, but still see this one as not complete or rushed. Again, for $29 very over priced.EDIT – 7-18-2016 – I now have more then 40 hours of game play in. The new patch finally released on the steam version has many of my gripes patched, but this should have been a while ago. Much more playable, but silly little bugs still exist. For example, occasionally when an aircraft turns on to the runway for takeoff, they make a 360 degree spin in under a second. Aircraft sound is still cheesy, I suspect that won't change. I'm not really sure what my expectations are of this game. After all, it is a game. But, if Dovetail follows their typical pattern, you will spend a ton of money on DLC, and see perpetual annoying bugs which will never be resolved."

Some pilots must be blind as they crash into an aircraft coming in from 90 degrees like they cant see them, which results in a collision, which kills your score, -500!! Some planes do a piroette at taxiway junctions, some planes sit at gates spinning for a while. Also, with the addon's there are duplicate timetabled aircraft which make things awkward.

No tooltips, clunky interface and rubbish almost non existent tutorial are further negatives, but the worst is the hefty, almost absurd penalties for mistakes, which takes the last bit of fun out of it.A rushed, half arsed effort.

Its not finished and should have been a beta. Its much too pricy in its current form. It contains a lot of buggy planes after a time, which cant be given commands.Things I expect in the future for starters:-Talk, both from my commands and from the pilots. Talk should be by voice actors and not computerized, it sounds awful.-Choice of different cameras and angles, better zoom on the camera and a free roaming camera.-More airports and planes.-A game manual. Tips and tricks for newbies.-Maps over the runways and more choices in commands. I dont understand if there is a way to guide the planes were I want them to taxi, instead of them choosing there own routes.Overall, the game has potential, and I really have high hopes on the developers as they have done a fairly good job with the predecessor games in 2d as I understand it."

76561198022263223,Recommended,459440,23792014,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,jeandeaux,"The mechanics of this simulator is pretty spot on, it's more realistic and much less ""gamey"" than others I have used.  As others have stated the graphics are pretty much Google Earth pics with a simulator played atop it, not really a negative in my book short of the pictures of planes on the runway that aren't really there, just part of the Google picture capture.That said, there are a few bugs that make playing Frustrating as these bugs are mainly with the scoring.  Each successful action nets you only 10 points but every negative action costs  you 500.  I'll have the occassional plane that will never leave the terminal and every new plane that enters or exits a nearby terminal to that stuck plane costs my 500 points due to hazard warnings.  LAX is riddled with departure and arrival scoring bugs and they get a bit quirky because they're hit and miss when you get the hazard hit.  If I've got a plane on 7L lined up and waiting with a plane landing on 7R I get hit with a penalty.  If I've got a plane taking off on 6R and one landing on 7R I get hit with a hazard penalty.If you completely ignore the scoring (which is the biggest negative to this sim) it is fun to play, especially managing the ground traffic.  I've never been in the positive numbers due to these scoring bugs, which is BIG negative experience to this sim.Overall, I'm giving it a thumbs up simply because I do enjoy playing this app and hope the developers give the scoring another pass and fix these bugs."

Maybe a few months down the roads after updates this will become as good as the previous version. This is one of the few games I have refunded on Steam.

I'm something of a fan of ATC sims, with a fondness for Air Traffic Chaos and its many spinoffs on the DS/3DS.  This sim just isn't up to their category in anything but sheer looks.Unfortunate, because it could have been great fun."
