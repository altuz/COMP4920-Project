76561198008042166,Not Recommended,459470,22849229,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,Silver,"It is with great sorrow that I will use the ""thumb down"" on this one.Except a addict wargamer, I am also a Napoleonic fan so I was more than happy to purchase when I got the newsletter from Slitherine that Wars of Napoleon is now on Steam.  First impression quite good: A LOT of game depth, tones of units and statistics, fog of war and proper army/corps displays and move with a per day/week system, quite interesting. The essential Napoleonic atmosphere was there, as well as the historical accuracy that history geeks like myself enjoy. There was a first dissapointment - no ""tutorial game"" to guide you through all the mechanics, something that I consider essential for ""deep"" tactical games, but what the hell - I simply watched all the tutorial videos instead, taking notes like a proper wargaming geek.The first scenario (Waterloo) went well, if we exclude the fact I got confused a few times with organisation of corps and movement, its a different thing to watch and to do it. I got there eventually and played through, but by the end of it another dissapointment emerged: Knowing almost nothing of the game, I easily won as France; the AI seemed to comprehent even less about the game than I did.So is that the reason of the thumbs down - hell no. It is the fact that upon starting the other scenarios, the game crashes begun. At first I think ""ok its a crash, it can happen"". Then the second crash a turn later starts to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and you change the Austerlitz scenario to the Prussian campaign. Then a third crash happens with the Prussians, so decide that I should no longer play the allies because with the French it did not crash during the first scenario. So I take the French in the Grand Campaign, taking 20 minutes to do a proper turn and it crashes again... twice.It is somewhere here that I stop trying. I do not mind the 30 euros, I would buy even if it was 50 because its my type of game. Nor will I ask for money back, hoping that later patches will fix it. But until then... the game is not ready. I sincerely hope the developers do something about it, because its evident that there is a lot of effort and love into this game and I want to play it. So I am waiting and hoping, but currently not recommending it unless people don't mind crashes every 30 minutes or so."

May be a great game if issues are fixed (and if the AI is improved). Noting that it has been in that state for the last 5 months, before hitting Steam, I would not hold my breath.Game in current state is worth 2.99 in my view... Once it delivers what is promised, it may be worth the full price."
76561198085864744,Recommended,459470,23019875,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,Alpha 6 (Miscreated),"Being a history buff and an avid player of wargames, both the old boardgames and the PC types, the release of Wars of Napoleon (WoN) is extremely welcomed.The artwork is beautiful, and the overall look of the game is superb.It is a detailed game with a steep learning curve, even with a complete reading of the manual and watching the tuturial videos. Grasping gameplay can be slow and sometimes frustrating, however, the designers (and the fans) of the game are very responsive to questions on the forums and will happily answer any questions, both technical/gameplay.With that said, sometimes there will be CTDs, but they are few and far between, make sure to save your game before processing a turn.It's a great game and will keep the player absorbed and engaged, much like Napoleon himself, as you try to bring your enemy to heel.Rating: 8/10"
,Recommended,459470,24702719,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Mr.,"If you are having start-up issues, windows 7,8, 10 this may help:http://steamcommunity.com/app/459470/discussions/0/352788552260073372/Wars of Napoleon is a napoleonic turn-based grand strategy game by Ageod, full of historical accuracy through army and navy composition, as well as detailed historical events, scenarios, etc. The main goal is to pick many of the main factions available in the game and try to capture or defend the objectives listed for the various scenarios in th game. With all AGE games ammo and food are accounted for, and the army and navy hierachy is always realistic and follows armies down to the regiment level, with the element being the lowest a unit can be broken down to. The map is huge, and the unit icons are beautiful and historically accurate, with the diplomacy tab paying homage to a Europa Universalis IV type way, where warscore and casus bellis are very much present in Wars of Napoleon that sets this AGE game from the others ones. For new players, this game is massive and will undoubtely confuse and haze new-comers not only to the genre of wargames, but games that use the AGE system as this is something that is original and allows the user a flexiable amount of control over the army, navy, economic, and political/diplomatic components of the nation the player choses to play. With that said, it is advised that players play the other AGE games that don't have a map and scale this large on such a grand strategy level and should try Alea Jacta Est, Civil War II, Rise of Prussia, Thirty Years' War, Espana 1936, or WIA: Birth of America II. I did not list To End All Wars or Revolution Under Siege because these games are of a much larger scope and are on similar par with Wars of Napoleon in being a massive game covering 10s to 100 thousands of troops. In order to learn how to play Wars of Napoleon your going to need to read the manual that is 100+ pages long, be willing to spend 15-30 minutes at least with each turn to experiment and learn the different function of the game, patient, and have a fond love and appreciation for unit counters and overall an accurate simulation of real warfare where whether, terrain, food, moral, ammunition, national, political, and ecnonomic factors all play a role in this realistic Napoleonic simulation. I've had my butt kicked by the AI repeatily trying to change the course of the waterloo battle, and have yet to succeed, as Napoleon is serious at odds against an now overwhelming coalition army as well as using a battle-weary, moral broken army that desperately wants to throw in the towel, with all this, the AI will not show you mercy. Getting your butt kicked is a big part of the learning process with any wargame, and is most importantly with any AGE title. However, I do gurantee the more time you spend to learn about the game, and when the point comes when you finally understand the game, and see that complex is actually simple, and that realize just how flexible this game really is you're going to love every second playing it, and most important, enjoy kicking the AIs butt when all your war plans and tactics finally work.All in all, I recommend Wars of Napoleon to those who are willing to learn the game and read the manual, but veterans of the genre will find another refreshing and unique period to cover in another AGE game where you have the possiblity to re-live the historic struggles of the combatants during this era, or change history if you are truly as a military genius as Napoleon. For new players of this game and genre, I advise caution, there is a 40$ price tag for a reason, this game is realistic, and covers so many factors of the war that you will not only be overwhelming by the price of this game, but the amount of simulation that it has to offer. I tip my hat to those who dare to enter the abyss."

But i must admit i find the game very enjoyable. If you are worried about turn times they are not that bad. But that does depend on what operating system you have at the moment.But anyways the game is awesome worth the buy and i have not yet had one crash on the game at all.

If you are a wargamer interested in the Napoleonic era (and I dont know many who are not) then this will will suit you to a t! On a different note, does not crash on me. Looking forward to some expansions!"

I find the most difficult thing to do is move parts of the armies I want. When I think I am doing it correct something else moves. I find this to be annoying at best. I do recommend this game. Just some learning curves I suppose in getting used to it. And yes, I have watched some of the videos in how to do some of these things. But still isn't working out the way I like. Well, if things turn around for me. I'll let you all know. Cheers!"

76561198041297604,Not Recommended,459470,23971350,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Wylding,"Needs about 6 to 9 months more development.  Turns will take 5 to 30 minutes to process.  There is no clear tutorial and the vast majority of interaction commands are hidden.  The game is severely niched - that is: you have to LOVE the era to even keep interested in playing this game.  Honestly, there are far better turn based strategy games out there for the Napoleonic era."
76561197978480307,Recommended,459470,33024220,Posted: 29 June,all,Evan,"I feel that a large number of the negative reviews about this game has to do with the crashing, while I have played it for a little over four hours I only had one crash. I visited the forums and saw some very helpful tricks to fix stability of the game and it hasn't crashed since.As a long time wargamer, but not entirely familiar with the AGEOD engine, it was surprisingly easy to pick up and understand without having to dive deep into the players manual.Pros;-A massive amounts of artwork for portraits and other unit cards.-All of mainland Europe was modeled, hundreds if not over a thousand regions.-The UI might seem or look a bit outdated, but it's extremely streamlined. It's easy to see data, and the tooltips are in fact helpful. (As a new player this was very important to me).-The battleplaner is a very way to make an impact on battles, and if it works out, you will be rewarded for choosing the correct plan.-It's also very nice to see that naval warfare is in the game, as I haven't actually engaged in it yet with my Austrian campaign, I can see that the British and Spanish are duking it out over the high seas every turn :)-Diplomacy is pretty well done, as it is possible to craft alliances and other diplomatic relations with all of the nations of Europe and elsewhere.-The game does have scripts so that things are somewhat structured, however there is leeway in that so the player does have the ability to flex theire strategic creativeness.Cons;-I wont' add stability / crashing as a con, as I believe the community has this issue using newer cards on an old engine. Using the forums and contacting their tech support is the best approach.-Tutorials are somewhat helpful, but it can take a bit of rereading to pick up minor missed details. I recommend visiting youtube, and the forums for more information about the game.-I think the largest con I see is that it can take a while for the computer to process turns, even gaming on a HPC it can stil take several minutes to get through a turn. (However once a turn is complete, depending on what nation you're playing as, you might need to take 15 minutes or more just to get everything done during your turn!)"

I decided to give WoN an entire evening and really learn it. First surprise, no tutorial (just videos). No problem. I decided to fuddle my way through a turn. I clicked on icons, dragged and dropped my way through the first turn of the full campaign. When I was satisfied I pushed next turn.... Crash 2 Desktop.REFUND! So I checked the forums.
