76561198013549332,Recommended,459540,23562733,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,"Punished ""Venom"" Kaban","So in light of all the rampant negativity toward this game, I figured I would talk about it as well.All in all? It's good. Not great. But it's fun and has a lot of charm. The price point is a touch steep for me, and I don't see it having all that much longevity, about 3 hours for a playthrough, or so. Replay value will probably trail off pretty quick, too, as you exhaust the dialogue for the girls you like best.  That in mind, waiting for a sale might not be a bad choice. Still, it's definitely worth playing.Most of the reviews I've seen cite the resolution as a major flaw of the game, and quite frankly that baffles me; not every indie japanese game thatbarelygets a translation at all can get the Fruitbat treatment. Japanese games don't tend to support higher resolutions. Very often UI elements lock the game to the default resolution. I could see it being an issue if you have a tiny monitor that you're running above its native resolution, but if you happen to be that corner case, you are going to have other problems on a daily basis anyway, resolution of this game being least among them. It might be annoying, sure, but to say it makes it a terrible game by default would be funny if it weren't so sad. The game is perfectly playable as is. Saying it's some sort of criminal cash-grab because they didn't add higher resolution support is... bizarre.Additionally I see a lot of complaints about a lack of transparency in the combat system, and enemy cards with low numbers frequently beating cards with higher numbers. This is because,as the game points out in both the tutorialandthe tips section, card value is not the only determinant of victory. The number next to the move in your move list is also a major determining factor. If you have a punch card with a value of five for instance, and pick a level 5 punch, it will lose to an opponent with a level 2 card.The phrasing in the tutorial could probably be clearer, but the tips section explains it rather plainly. If you don't understand the mechanics and yet you haven't bothered to look at the freely accessible help section, that is not necessarily the game's fault.The game has a high amount of luck involved, but like any game that involves rolling dice, the strategy lies in minimizing the amount you have to rely on it. Choose skills that do so.And finally, I've seen a lot of complaints about how the game has ironman mode on at all times. Just back up your save if you don't want an engaging and tense experience. Seriously I've never seen so many people PC Master Race so hard about resolution without knowing how to PC.Now that that rant about how to play the game is out of the way, the game does have its fair share of problems. While the references were initially endearing, they're so constant throughout that it starts to grate after a while. ""Oh. The girl with a stand made another Jojo reference. How unexpected.""The inability to check what a character's moves do if she's not in your team is also brutal. While I could see it being because in reality youwouldn'tknow what these moves are if you don't know the girl, it's rather frustrating in a gameplay environment, especially when the AI obviously has no such disadvantage.The tutorial is a bit vague, and some of the wordings (particularly on the card value and move value subject) could use some clarification, and while the tips section helps, it doesn't explain everything (lax or strict club environments? That one i have only guesses on). There are useful tips on loading screens, but with no easy way to view all of them at once, it's not the best way to present that information. Additionally, some NPCs around the school will give ""useful"" advice, but since you have to spend AP to even wander the school, these conversations are a frustrating waste of money rather than actually helpful most of the time.The art is quite nice, though. Combat portraits and everyday portraits are both very high quality, although the difference in style can be a bit jarring in some cases. Character writing is also quite wonderful as far as the girls I've seen, Liling best girl, though that might be heavily to taste. Several characters fell a little flat for me, though that too may just be taste in archetypes.Overall feels like the hate is unwarranted. People's main complaint being the resolution ought to make that obvious anyway."
,Not Recommended,459540,23558103,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,PoppaGrim,"I tried to like this game, I really did.The art is great, the sound is decent and upbeat. The resolution didn't bother me and I don't care about saving.However, this game has a combat system that is punishing, random, and lacks transparency. I can forgive a game for any one of those three, but games--like this one--that combine the three are not fun.Combat is punishing. Mistakes incur devastating penalties.Combat is random. Each round you are given 5 random cards, each of which has a rank from 1-5 and an attack type (punch, kick, throw, etc). It sounds intriguing, but then the reality of RNG stes in: your boxer--who only deals damage with one of the 6 card--may *easily* go 5 rounds in a row without drawing a card that permits you to use a punch. IF you do get a card that permits a punch, it may then be a rank so low that the attack will fail. Combine that with the devastating penalties, and you have numerous occasions where the game gives you the illusion of choosing your attacks, but the underpinning gameplay reality is that all your choices result in failure.Combat is not transparent. It isn't clear what moves win and when they win. What is clear is that the CPU opponent will always win ties. Sometimes, the CPU will use a low ranked card and higher ranked card will still lose; this would be okay if your lower ranked card sometimes won. They don't, and you get no explanation why.There are so many great games available on Steam that I feel cheated when a belligerent developer insists on this type of bad gameplay and poor instructions. Stay away from this game!"
76561198036328170,Recommended,459540,23613267,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,jfulltime,"This game had a few mixed reviews here on Steam, so I was hesitant to buy it, even on sale. I'm glad I did, though, as this game is a lot of fun. The developers must have paid attention to the reviews about the resolution and full screen mode, as these features have been changed now and I ran the game beautifully in full screen.I found the tutorials and the tip pages to be just fine in teaching me how to play the game. Sure, the systems aren't fully transparent, but that would take the fun out of the game if they were. Part of the challenge and enjoyment of this game is trying to figure out what works best in combat and training. There is a learning curve, and you should expect to lose a few matches (or even lose the game on your first play through.) If everything was handed to you right away it wouldn't be any fun.I will admit the random card values and odd tiebreak system did upset me from time to time. While it may seem like the computer wins ties more often, if you play enough you will see it does even out. Unfortunately, I hated when the rng failed me. My first playthrough I was in the finals and both teams were down to a single girl. My girl was half health and the opponent was at a sliver. My three highest cards were all 4s, and my opponent got all 5s, and I lost. Fortunately, the game autosaves before the final so you can replay those as much as you need to in case you get hosed by the rng.I think the replay factor on this game is great. There are a ton of combinations of girls to choose from, and each has a wide variety of moves they could learn. With the numerous strategies for training, coordinating the girls, and leanring moves, I'm excited to play through a few more times to see which strategy can work the best.I got this on sale ($11) and I think it was a great deal at that price. I may not  have tried it at the full $15, but even at that price it would still be a decent game."

Game autosaves beginning of each day. Tested by closing the game mid-day.For fans of Cherry Tree High, you'll be happy to see two returning characters from the main cast.Art is a significant step up from CTHCC and CTHCC My Girls.Pleasant sound with each character having a theme, and plenty of dialogue per character to give some personality.You assemble a team of 3 fighters, each of whom has an introductory dialogue.Unfortunately, you're forced to recruit the character once you speak to them.A bit of a bummer, but you do get a brief background on the character and fighting style before you make the choice.The game is broken out into Monday-Friday weeks, with Monday-Thursday being a stat sim and Friday being the weekly fighting competition.One major flaw is the limited instructions. The ingame tips and stat screen cover the basics of how to raise your fighters and combat, but not much else.The lack of stat values on moves is especially frustrating. It was a process of trial-and-error before finally settling on using certain moves.Most of my success in the campaign came from abusing Unblockables, Numbing (stun effect), and just brute forcing it with Asuka (STR build).Overall, it was enjoyable, but this is as a fan of CTHCC and someone who likes stat sims/card battles.Resolution lock and manual save weren't a deal breaker, but can be annoying.You have to save by going to Settings (ingame) and return to the Title Screen.Surprisingly, this game does not have a New Game Plus like CTHCC.EDIT: The game saves topics unlocked through playthroughs.At its worst, the game feels like a rush to min/max your characters while trying to figure out how the combat system works.Characters heavily favor certain move types, so it's better to specialize rather than make a jack-of-all trades.It takes a significant amount of training to force a character to excel elsewhere.With a better guide and more forgiving RNG, this could be substantially better.The characters and aesthetics were definitely charming, and the story, albeit odd at the end, was pleasant enough.A nice touch is the first girl you pick gets an extra epilogue conversation."

Glaring combat issues. Your available actions are dictated by RNG, and there outcomes also seem to be dictated by RNG sometimes, but you don't know for sure, because the game doesn't explain $#!7. You get punished for not making mistakes, while the AI just does stupid things while you sit back and can't punish them because of how combat works.

Cherry Tree High My Girls unfortunately removed the recruitment system but the dialogue was atleast just as funny as the first game.But THIS... this game has none of the appeal of the previous games, the characters feel like carbon cut-outs they aren't interesting or realistic they're just there, even the best characters from the previous games are now written like insignificant NPC characters (even in the first game the NPC felt alive and like real people.)And now for the gameplay, the idea isn't that bad but has been executed horribly. You basically pick three girls and train them for the weekly battle against another girls fight team, but I feel you get way too little time to train for the first fight and training your characters and watching them fight just isn't fun, it's not just that you hardly do something. That isn't necessarly a problem but if you're forced to watch something boring. I.E watching lifeless characters fight and train and give the most basic response to the results (With zero personality) yes then it's a problem. You can also walk around the school during your free 4 days before the fight this takes CP but it doesn't even feel worth it because then you have to listen to the boring and uninpired NPC characters talk so that you have a conservation topic for your for when you want to talk to your boring and uninspired girls-fight members. (NEVER)It's just such a disappointment playing this game after the great first two CTH games, this game just doesn't have the charm of these games. So even if you're a fan of the series I just can't recommend it, just play the other CTH games those are great and I hope we get a sequel to those in the style of the first one one day."

76561198053746061,Recommended,459540,24125103,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,tzubidu,Its a nice little turnbased game where you manage a team of 3 students for a team fight.You can set 3 actions for each girl each day from monday to friday while the fight is at saturday.Also you have some actions as manager and the action points you have each week depend on your performance in the fight last week.Now we come to the bad part of the game its the randomnes of the battle system combined with no free save and load and not be able to free change your 3 girls during the fight.I personal think it was a stupid move by the developer to cut the free save and load from this game just to add a online ranking system to a single player game. The online ranking system is also complet worthless because of the a easy exploitable auto save that only save at the end (start?) of a turn.Still I think this game even in the curent form is worth a buy at a 50% or higher discount or if they improve the fighting part and add manual save and reload also the regular price.

Well, at least on of each (if possible) and 1 and 2 value.Third time: Cleaned the Whole House.Well, each time you play you end unlocking skills for your character (manager) which help.I first impulse of a team was the team that I ended up choosing all the time I played: Motoko, Rin and Liling.Liling has a counter move that’s really overpowered, especially if you powerup her Chi. One or two counters can knock out even the strongest opponent.Rin has a Henshin move, but it’s not very useful. Striking is better, and everything with Stun is gold.Motoko – learn all the stun moves and punish their legs, it’s awesome. I love Motoko!"

Please read the description and look at the screenshots, this is not a waifu fighter, it's a card battle game and training sim, and it's great at both of those things.The new characters are a lot of fun (oh my lord Chacha) and the balance between training and fights is well handled. Every girl comes with their own skills, and figuring out the best stat focus for them is really rewarding. Overall, great stuff! Would like if there was a gender option for the player character, but that's a minor gripe.Absolutely recommended if you like VN/light sim stuff."

Its like a frp game without a dice.Game had more potencial than current state. Its sad. Art is great, details are good, game play is addictive and fights are fun but still something is missing. First of all story is so weak. Some ways this game very similar with punch club. Rpg elements of puch club is better than cherry tree but cherry trees combat is more fun, deep and strategic. Maybe more animations (fighting and training), deeper story (like diffrent lore for every combatans, we are selecting 3 of them so combinations make more interesting the lore), minigames and side quests did make this game perfect but this is an indie game so i cant aspect high. But still its a pretty good game and worth to play.Tip: All girls have no equal potencial. With training some of them will become overpowered (like Haruno. She is using only Spirit. Its make her easy to train)"

It's not actually really about the fighting, it's actually about the training and maximizing the efficiency of your team.The content for this game is lacking. There's two modes, easy and normal, and then hard is unlocked after beating the game on normal. The replayability is low because there's not much variation in the game, you really play it by the books and there's no real way to make the game feel like you crafted a fighting squad. As far as the fights themselves go, everything is left to imagination. It's a system used in Wrestle Angels as well, it's based solely on cards.If you are a fan of Japanese sim games, this is for you. If you're a female fight fan like me, it's alright if you're creative. If you're looking for a fighting game, look somewhere else.I'll give this game my reccommedation not because I think you should buy it, but because I feel it deserves my approval."

It took me awhile to figure out how the card battle works, and I can see why many people are frustrated due to lack of transparancy.  I would still recommend this game because I've ejoyed playing it and 773 / Seikai Project has made efforts to improve the game.Card battle tips here:http://www.giantbomb.com/cherry-tree-high-girls-fight/3030-54287/PositivesGood musicGood anime styled art workGood visual novel styled dialogueReplay the game to learn different character's strengths/weakenesses, discovering 'scenarios' for each character (keywords), and Online RankingsNegativesCard battle is not transparant, the tutorial doesn't go into detail and you can't view opponent's statsToo many variables that is RNG based, which alters the outcome of the card battleNo PvP, only single-player on Easy/Normal/Hard mode(unlocked upon 1st completion)"
76561198022395444,Recommended,459540,34950697,Posted: 14 September,all,Wolfenstahl,"I played through this game so many times now.It's a really good one and I love the characters.Especially Asuka, Kei and Kyoko, as well as Asumi and Haru but everyone else is sweet too.They gave every girl some background story and personality, and there's quite a lot of characters. Of course this means it's not super deep on character backgrounds as there's just too many characters. But for the amount of characters present in the game, this is not surprising and they did a really good job with that. I mean, come on, it's one thing to flesh out 1 or 2 characters and do a great game with those, but this game has 15 characters, you gotta account for that.Combat system is also quite good.I know there's some reviews claiming it's random and stuff.But there's actually a tutorial as well as explanations in a help menu in the game.I'll add a brief explanation about the combat system to the end of this review.It might take a while to fully understand how combat works.Sometimes you need to make guesses on what the enemy might do or not do.But it's not as bad as it sounds on some of the reviews.And I mean, basically in almost every game I can think of you need to ""guess"" or ""take a risk"" from time to time.So it's really not that bad.If you want to play it safe in Cherry Tree High Girls' Fight, you should just use your highest number cards and use the weakest attacks.It does less damage, but almost always works out.Use the weak cards to block and reduce damage if you have no good cards on your hand.Of course you can't generalize, but with this simple advice you should do a lot better in combat.High level attacks do lots of damage, but they can fail if your opponent uses a weaker (and thus ""faster"" = higher priority) attack.Using high level attacks is high risk, high reward basically.Short summary of the combat system:The number on a card will be added to the attacks priority.Weak attacks usually have high priority, strong attacks have low priority.Your attack priority will be compared to the enemies attack priority.Higher priority wins, lower priority get's hit.If attack priorities are equal, the stronger attack will win.There's some counter moves like ""counter punch attacks"" that always win against punch attacks no matter the priority though.But other than that, that's basically how the combat system works.Note:Read the ingame tutorial and explanation for the full details.This is just a quick summary!TL;DR:If you like a nice visual novel with some turn based combat and lots of cute girls, this might be for you.Keep in mind though that the combat system might not be for everyone.You need to dig in and take some time to read the tutorial and get used to how it works."
