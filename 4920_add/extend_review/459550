Even with the patch it would not register as porn in my opinion but it also is not for children as it has some nudity and sexual content. It is a somewhat comical story of a young man tasked with getting 3 neurotic artists to work. I give it a positive rating because 2 of the artists are very memorable. I did not expect that from a visual novel. If you put the Bounce series of V.N.'s on one end of the spectrum this is on the other end. As far as I can tell the only decision that matters in the game is the last one. There is an effort to add some erotic content toward the end but it felt ""tacked on."" So if you are looking for porn or eroticism keep looking but if you want a well written funny story this may be for you."

The only choice that really matters is around the endingwhere you get to choose which girl you want to stay with. You can be a total jerk to these girls, they are still going to want a piece of you.I liked the fact that you can choose the gender of the MC too. BGM was okay, but kind of repetitive. Overall, I recommend this gameonlyon a sale. Not really worth paying the full price on this title, in my opinion.5/10."

The writing is corny and riddled with typos. It's just bad. It'd be fine if this was being sold for $5 but at $10 (or even the launch discount of $8.49) it's just too much to ask for such a short and limited VN."

Sadly Catch Canvas strikes me as a failure to be a game or a novel.I gave this game several run thoughs, where I made different choices, big surprise it didn't change a thing at the end. Male/Female, you are supportive, you are jerk, the ending ends up being the same. You come down to one of three women to choose from, you get the adult action where there is some minor ending, and game over.As much as I want to support developing young studios with fresh ideas, I think these people need to hire a writer or two to help get some decent character and multiple endings if they don't want to end up seeing thier game sales punge. Since as great as sex is to sell, gamers tend to want some substance."
,Not Recommended,459550,26095466,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Estaban J R M DeLa Rosa Ramirez,"I honestly enjoyed this game. However there are a few improvements that need to be made before I'd recommend this game to anyone.Pros: Compelling narrarative with highly dynamic and intriguing characters, as well as a plot twist that, while  not on the level of a triple A title, adds value to the story.Cons: Advertises the ability to ""Romance any girl"" and that your ""choices affect the ending"". While these aren't false advertisements per se, they arent entirely truthful. While there are choices to be made during certain scenarios, these choices really don't affect the ending of the story. Also when it says ""romance any girl"" it means -----<SPOILER ALERT>------ the only romancing option is at the end of the game and you only really get to choose who to fornicate with.How this game could be improved and overall be more than a slightly interactive graphic novel:Expand apon the choices feature of the game. Take the idea of developing relationships with each individual girl, and make the player able to choose who they want to romance. Seeing as, in the end, you end up being able to choose any of the three girls, I feel it would add much more depth to the game to able to choose who you want to devel a relationship with so your end game is affected by it. I mean there are so many pivotal moments in the plot where a choice made by the player rather than a pre-made script would have added alot more depth to the game and would have overall made the game much more fun to play as well as adding to the replay value.In conclusion, for now I NOT be recommending this game until some further development is made."

The story is very very flat and you do not have many choices and those you have do not have any impact or relevancy. At the end you get a spicy scene out of nowhere that is not really supoorted by the story.I have played much better games, with choices that matter and really increase the replayability and also with much deeper characters and better spicy scenes.This one falls flat- It is not particuallary horrible but not by any means good."

The shame of that is it has so little variance, impressing as a lazy production relying on unyielding repetitive images.  The few choices that were presented did little to change the outcome.  While I have no doubt there was extensive effort in programming, I would emphasize it would have taken little additional effort to produce a much better product by using quality content."

,Not Recommended,459550,26087157,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Shy,"""Catch Canvas"" is a short visual novel that was created by I believe the same people who released ""No One But You"".Although I did not personally play that one I did not hear many good things about it and from my experience with this game I have to say that I am not interested in their other title.At the time of this review the price of the game is $9.99 or $8.49 on sale when I purchased it.This game suffers from a few things like a lack of a story that is finished in about 2 hours. I am not saying short games are not worth a higher price tag, but the quality in story and short length of this title does not justify it's cost. I am pretty sure someone in middle school could write something similar to this for an essay or something.The art in my opinion is pretty good. It isn't outstanding, but it is far from poor. So if I was to give it any good points it would be that. (Although the 18+ patch was rather dissapointing since 18+ scenes is basically this games selling point.)Characters were alright. At first they were mediocre at best, but I grew to sort of like all 3 of them. However, I still didn't feel attached. Some of the dialogue was entertaining I have to admit. It's a shame that the story wasn't a little longer with better character development since most of the character development was rushed or just extremely sudden. (Estelle is the biggest offender of rushed development and Nao was a missed opportunity.)Overall this is not that great of a VN especially for the price. It feels like a bunch of missed opportunities to make it more than what it is."
76561198069159152,Recommended,459550,30311834,Posted: 4 March,all,wrb41977,"This visual novel is a fun read. You arrive at your uncle's cabin and find that he has left, placing you in charge of three girls. They all have their own issues, and your job is to make sure they complete a project and pass that. In return, you will be allowed to stay and take classes under your world-renowned uncle's tutorship.While there is only three choices that really matter in the story, two being which gender you'll play as and your name, each of the girls are equally interesting. And while there is only one actual scene with your chosen target that deals with your... relationship, it is done relatively tastefully. (Again personality of each girl might cause some... issues with the term ""tasteful"".)"
,Recommended,459550,29923883,Posted: 14 February,all,TwiliSailor,"While this game is completely marketed for H fans. In reality there is very little sexual content at all until the very end of the game, and even then unless you go out of your way to patch in an uncensored version theres very little to see in this regard. But it's not entirely an unenjoyable experience as a visual novel. It's too expensive for how little playtime you really have, but the story is satisfying. There are large walls of text with very little else going on; Especially in terms of player decisions so some fans of more robust VA's may be turned off. Characters have a suprising amount of depth, despite how cliche it all ends up being.It's not really a great game but it's hard to find faults that have much meaning. It'll help you kill an hour or two of downtime and the art is really nicely drawn. Catch Canvas gets the lowest possible recomendation from me. If there was a ""meh"" button it would better fall under that."

That's it. You get a couple choice options and at the end you have to choose a girl without it really explaining how your characters progressed after they finished their paintings. Story wise I would give this 3.5/10 because it cut off so abruptly and ended so poorly."
76561198032109396,Not Recommended,459550,28349033,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,Minervamedica,"The general summary of the plot (spoiler free) is that you are a relative of a famous artist (your uncle) and when you get to this remote island there are 3 students there who are girls your age. Your uncle tells you to whip these girls into shape and have them finish their assignment (paint a particular picture). As time goes on you learn how to motivate each of them along with some character development. You have 3 weeks to do this in game time and that is relevant because much of the content in the novel is repeated as a routine which takes away from it because of its short length.Game lasted me about 2 hours and I used the patched adult version just to get all the content out of it. There were very few choices and the game pace felt very fast. It wasn't bad per say it was just so short and much of the story ended up repeating its self day in and day out. Definitely buy on sale IMO. There are no ""Routes"" either the only choice that really felt like it a big impact was the final choice of the girl you stayed with. There are some choices but they are far and few between and its difficult to tell if they really have any impact on the ending  (but i doubt it).There were some quirky character elements and some character development but the repetition kind of killed it as your relationship with the characters just kind of stagnates quickly.6/10. Not terrible but below the average bar of a VN for 10$.If this goes on sale then i'd recommend it as long as your cool with a very short story with few choices.  Please note I don't care about the nudity and eroge so much its just a nice bonus but didn't make the novel any worse or better to me personally but if the option is free and avaiable i'll take it."

Within this period of time, I managed to enjoy the first 2.5 hours.However, the last 10-15 minutes of reading was rather disappointing, as the ending I felt was ""rushed"".Unwonted Studios & Razzart Visual did a fantastic job conveying the ""prologue"" story where the characters bond with each other as ""friends"" during the early (and most) part of the game, whilst leaving any romance-inducing interactions/moments unexploited. This leads to an inadequate immersion to the relationship of the protagonist and his/her chosen partner.With that said, taking into consideration of the price this game was given and the fact that the developers are quite new in this industry with only a few games released, it is a very decent game.I believe the team from both Unwonted Studios and Razzart Visual has plenty of potential.

Gameplay is as to be expected from a VN although i found the rewind function makes all choices raher pointless and i found the CGs beautifully drawn, as for the story it is rather simple and straight forward with small attempts at drama in parts, the characters fall into their own archetype (shy girl, the ditzy cute girl, and a tsun-tsun). ***THE ENDING*** this wont spoil anything although just saying because of the ending all previous choices made mean nothing its very anti-climatic too.Now if your like me and you downloaded the 18+ patch (recommended) the H-scenes are nothing too speical and the sexual content is rather minimalOver all Catch Canvas is a fun, cute, little (very little) VN.

Its not worth the asking price though, unless one REALLY wants to see those endings, and if its on a sale of some sort. With the story itself being bland, a desire for a peaceful game and a yearning for lustful satisfaction are the reasons to fork over $8 - $10. The game isn't bad by any means, but its not special or unique either. If one does want to spend the money though, wait for a sale to pop up, and ensure that one has the free uncensored patch downloaded and at the ready."

There is absolutely no gameply in it at all. The entire ""game"" is esentially a railroad track of mediocure character writng with no real story. The only thing you can actually control is which of the 3 girls you end up with at the end. These endings are entirely forced as you don't have routes so you don't bond with any of them in particular. It is simply pick a girl at the very end and that is it. All other choices in the game are entirely cosmetic and have no effect whatsoever.Gameplay 0/10 - No actual choices or gameplay.Story 3/10 - Boring, very boring.Characters 6/10 - The characters are just archetypes but there is decent attention given to their motivations and individualism.Art 7/10 - The art for this game is actually pretty good with it's angles and quality. However it suffers several major flaws. The first is reused assests as you will be seeing the same CG, backgrounds, and sprites over and over again with little change. The pacing of the CG is so bad where you will see nothing new for a long time then suddenly get multiple new CG all of a sudden and none of it feels earned as their are no choices or gameplay.Overall 3/10 - This is not a game.
