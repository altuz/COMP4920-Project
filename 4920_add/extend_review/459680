I know I'm in the minority here, but things that are truly novel just speak to my soul. Because of that, I tend to drift from game to game, playing everything in my library at least once or twice, but hardly ever come back to them once I ""get it"".Auro is not one of those drift-able games! I originally bought it on Android about a year ago, and have sunk hours and hours into it. This game offers true strategy, not the feigned depth of most strategy games out there. Most strategy games add tons and tons of complexity to their rule-set to keep the player from ever mastering the them. Auro keeps it super simple and elegant. After a hardcore year of trying to ""get it"" I keep being delighted with the emergence of strategies discovered through gameplay!Seriously, out of every game I've ever owned, Auro is the game that has kept my adult brain entertained the longest.Dive in, bump some foes, give it a solid chance. You'll be glad you dropped a few bucks on a game that rivals the simplicity and elegance of the greats like Chess or Go. A modern take on a true evergreen game."

After all this time and thousands upon thousands of matches, I'm still playing it almost every day. At this point I can safely say that this is one of the BEST VIDEO GAMES EVER.While it may seem simple and like a typical ""mobile game"" at first sight, there is a LOT more to it. The emergent depth this game unfolds over time is quite incredible and puts at least 90% of all PC and console game releases to shame. Every piece, every single rule, in the game has been balanced and honed for years to make for one of the best examples we have of a well-designed gameplay system. Rest assured that you have never played a ""dungeon crawler"" like this before.The laser-sharp focus on the core mechanism of ""bumping"" makes every monster and spell in the game work together beautifully. On top of that though, the ""competitive single-player"" metagame is nothing less than revolutionary in how it does away with pretty much every typical problem of match-based ""highscore"" single-player games.Do yourself a favor and buy this game! And in doing so, tell the world that good gameplay matters more than audiovisual pomp and exploitative business models."

The game never looked terrible, but the new coat of paint looks great and is definitely appreciated. The campaign mode, too, has been re-themed and reworked. The menus don't have the same graphical polish as the rest of the game, but for the £6 asking price I'm not too fussed.I should warn the people thinking of buying - this is a tactics game through and through. If you're looking for an immersive story or buckets of content you should go elsewhere. But if you enjoy strategy games like Advance Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, Outwitters, or even Chess then you'll get a lot of value out of Auro. The game starts simple, but put in a little effort and it rapidly ramps up the number of pieces on the board and becomes pretty deep.I'll probably be putting as many hours into this as I did on the mobile version. I recommend it to anyone who likes tactics games."

Hit escape twice while you're in game? Congrats, you just broke it and you're forced to restart. Once I catch word of the developer addressing this, I'll flip my review over to positive."

,Recommended,459680,22519236,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,BouncePalace,"Solid gameplay and a complexity that's purely the result of good design, not clutter and frustration. You won't get caught off guard by random effects or failures, (enemies act according to their rules, spells have the intended effect,) but every situation is very different, and that just means you can plan your strategy, which you will need to do, to survive. Try stacking spells and attacks, or even let monsters attack or use a spell in a new situation, they've thought all the possibilities out extremely well. It has the fun of a dungeon crawler, but the tactics of Chess... if the board were different, every time... and your queen could make pawns trail fire, as they move.It's easy enough to sit and play a round or two, and be totally satisfied. More often, though, I find myself trying to ride a winning streak, or coming up with a tactic I'm dying to try, and I've played half a dozen rounds before I realize it. Then I play another half dozen, just to round it out. Dinofarm Games has a knack for making you feel like a badass, until you make a poor decision, and then you learn that they aren't holding your hand. Creative thinking and a little planning are the keys to success. With a decent, fair learning curve, beautiful pixel art, good music, and a sense of humor, Auro easy to pick up, but with enough depth, variation, and challenge to keep it from getting stale."

You have to activate a special info mode to find out what your spells do instead of being able to just right-click on them because, again, this is a bad mobile port. Gameplay itself is just okay.

The first few levels are easy, learning levels I guess. There aren't a huge amount of spells and enemies (about 10 of each in total) but what there are all combine together in clever ways. One of the things the spells do is change the actual board tiles which I really like - helps move around and set up longer kill chains which is the way to score best. It's obvious the developers have been tuning all that stuff for a long time, and I think they've done a good job. Also got the iPad version which is slightly different atm - I'll probably play them both a lot, it's a very replayable game. Feels a bit like Hoplite to play but about 10 times as interesting, or Panzer General on some kind of weird acid trip! Well worth a fiver."

Tactics game that does an awesome job of keeping you on your toes and maintaining a steady difficulty level using win-streaks in combination with rankings. Characters are lovable and hilarious.This is one of the best games I have seen this year. I'm looking forward to seeing it on mobile and I strongly recommend to anyone that likes to feel clever."

I also appreciate how Auro uses an 'ELO' system to encourage the player to keep playing and improving, instead of just a high score list.  The art style and music are very nostalgic; it feels like i'm playing a game on a sega genesis or super nintendo.  All in all, Auro is a very good game that feels worthwhile to play."

It's an almost perfect blend of strategic gameplay in bite-sized portions. The depth is also misleading at first, since the mechanics seem quite simple although they end up being quite hard to master. I'm enjoying the Steam version right now if only due to the change in gameplay mechanics where some of the abilities do different things.My only minor negative would be that the game could use a little more depth, like a campaign mode or different stage skins. I'd recommend for anyone to try it out; totally worth it for the price."
,Recommended,459680,22570942,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,B1ackJack94,"Without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played, and definitely the most replayable single-player game I've come across. Very few other games ask as much of your creativity and ingenuity and you feel truly rewarded when you pull a high point yielding sequence. Even after playing the game for months on iOS (and this version is much, MUCH more polished and refined), I find myself in new situations and I'm still discovering new gameplay interactions that are possible. The gameplay system is so novel, unique, and dynamic and I can't see myself getting tired of it any time soon. The artwork and music are excellent and charming to boot.While I have close to zero complaints in terms of gameplay, the content and presentation leave a bit to be desired. A practice mode where you could manipulate the terrain, experiment with all the spells, and learn how monsters behave would be a great stress-free learning tool. Currently, the only way to learn the game is within the ranked mode, and it can feel bad to be put into an unfavorable position or even lose because you didn't know what a monster or spell would do, and potentially rank down because of it.The HUD, while visually pleasing, does not have enough feedback and doesn't take full advantage of the platform. Instead of clicking on the magnifying glass and then clicking on something else to learn about it, a simple right click would feel much more elegant and intuitive. Having certain elements, like spells and menu text for example, highlight when hovered over would make the game feel more responsive. Little things like that can go a long way.I'd love to see a PvP mode where players are given the same set of spells on the same random map generation and compete to reach the score goal in the fewest amount of moves. Similarly, I'd love for there to be replay functionality. Additions like this would be great in helping players be more aware of different possibilities in situations that they may otherwise not see.Some more content, like a couple more monsters and spells, could be nice, although I don't think they're at all necessary since the current selection offer an incredible amount of depth already that I'm still exploring.I truly hope that the game receives the publicity it deserves to incentivize the developers to add these and other upgrades to their already fantastic game. I strongly recommend Auro to anyone who has ever enjoyed playing a game."

This turn based strategy game, unlike other games in the genre, moves fluently and remains engaging long after winning.  In short, Auro both plays to the strengths of the Turn based strategy genre, and revolutionizes the mechanics in new and engaging ways.

,Recommended,459680,23006108,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,Wizard Styles,"The gameplay is great. The concept is simple and the game is easy to get into, but everything feels fresh. Your goal is to bump monsters into the water, and to that end you use a handful of abilities and the terrain itself, occasionally also turning the monster AI on itself. All while ideally avoiding to be eaten.This comes together really well, because the abilities, tiles and monsters are all designed with simplicity in mind but taken together present you with interesting problems to solve.The animations are also very nice.The port could be a lot better, though. I haven't played the mobile version, but there are just a lot of things that could have been better. For example, when you want to see information about a specific tile or monster, you first have to click on the magnifier button you'll see in the upper left when you look at the screenshots. Then you click on the tile. This has no place in a PC game, in this case this whole process could be avoided by just using a left-click for info/right-click to move or bump scheme.There are also no zoom or scrolling functions as far as I can tell, which can be annoying, especially when you walk straight into a pack of monsters you couldn't see and really don't want to deal with right now.Overall I like this game a lot for its unique, challenging and addictive gameplay, but I hope some work is done on the PC version because the UI is a little clunky when it really doesn't need to be."
,Recommended,459680,26140251,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,Flying Shisno,"This is a very fun Roguelike Board Game hybrid. You play in a Arena on a Hex Grid, with a set number of points you need to reach. You start out in the lowest League, and require a very small number of points. I believe the lowest League only requires 15 points. The goal, is to move into enemies, bumping them back one space, preferably into the water, which kills them. Water kills are common, though there's a handful of other ways and some fancy ways to knock them out the arena. Kills are worth 1 Point, but the more kills you get, the more your Combo Meter increases. I believe it's only 3-4 kills to go from Level 1 to Level 2, and the required amount of kills increases per Combo Level. If you have a Combo Level of 1, then you'll get 1 point per kill. If you have a Combo Level of 2, you'll get 2 points per kill, and so on.To help you in this task, you have 3 Abilities and 1 Rune Slot. The Abilities you can think of like spells or something like that.You're given a random 3 abilities and 1 rune at the start of each match. The Abilities/run can be stuff like ""rotate all adjacent enemies either clockwise or counter-clockwise(your choice"", which let's you rotate enemies into the water, or other hazards. Then there's various movement Abilities like Dash in a strait line 3 Hexes or launch a blast of fire to Hexes in any direction, plus a whole lot more. When used, they go on cooldown, but they don't cooldown with movement/turns, but by stepping on/collection the glowing symbols on the floor. Runes are the same as Abilities, except they're consumed when used and you can find more runs laying about the place.There's a large amount of enemies too. They all move differently and attack differently, and most importantly, they can knock you out of the arena too, or even outright damage you on contact, since yes, you have a life bar that will auto-fail you if you die(levels are short, so it's not a big penalty).As I mentioned earlier, there are Leagues, which you progress through by filling the Rank Meter. You can think of Leagues like Difficulty levels. Bronze League is the first/lowest I believe. In there, you need only 15 points per match in order to win. When you win, you get an amount of points the fill the Rank Meter. You get more points if you're on a win streak. When the Rank Meter Fills, you advance to the next League, which introduces 1 or 2 new abilities and enemies each League.If you're good at strategy or these types of games, you can take a placement test to test your abilities, and when you eventually die, it ranks you appropriately. So if you're skilled you're not forced to start at the bottom, though I think you're required to at least finish the tutorial.The graphics and sound are okay, though art wise there's certainly a large variety of enemies, though unfortunately the same can't be said for arena variety.All in all, if you like Strategy, Roguelike, or Board Games, I DEFINITELY recommend this.Edit:For some reason, I can't post long-ish reviews in one go, I have to submit half of it first, THEN post the rest of it in an edit."

I can say that this 2.0 version is all brand now from the looks and feel to content which i just cant wait to dive  back into for hours on end!So since it may be hard to tell from the trailer the point of the game is to push or dunk  enemies into the dark abyss of the sea!

Then  youll get a little fancy and use a snow ball or one of the many other spells and push a monster in the water with that. Then when your feeling a little more frisky you will combine 2 different spells and maybe get a combo and push TWO monsters into the abyss with one turn! WAIT... why stop there,now your feeling like your getting the hang of things and feeling fancy, so you sacrifice a health to get some monsters in position, pop off 2 spells AND  a Ultimate and BOOM! 5 MONSTERS decimated, tons of points for doing it all at once and you feel like a complete Bada**Now your feeling super pro and you.... wait... you see where this is going!

Can't remember when I last played a game without full screen. It was promised but not delivered.There is no in game documentation, you are sent to a website for a poorly written, extremely confusing set of rules. This game is crying out for on screen help - you should be able to hover over a monster and get the relevant information about it. For a game that is suppose to be simple the rules are horribly complex. It took me many attempts to wade through the rules and I still have little idea of what strategies to use.This game needs a practise mode so that you can test things out without losing a game.There are apparently game killing bugs but I didn't get far enough into the game to discover them."
