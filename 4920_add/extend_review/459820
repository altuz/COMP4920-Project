,Recommended,459820,29437662,Posted: 22 January,all,Whiteswart,"One of the best clicker games on the market, nurtured by all the waifu stuff you can probably imagine. Yeah, it's even give you the opportunity to make relations with Eva ""the Genesis"" and Lina Inverse... I'm not quite familiar with the dating sims, but if they all as cute as this one, then that seems to be my kind of gameplay as well.Yeah. Waifu stuff is weird, dating sims are even more weird, and clicker games are time consuming and very bad (in gameplay terms and whatnot). If you're still OK with all those things, then - go on! Download the game, it's free and fun enough! And... the point I like the most, it's reasonable to the end, even if the financial in-game system seems quite off for some time. Eventually, after some restarts, it all will come to you. Yeah, everything you need is to advance your reset multiplier up to 1500 - 2000 count. And then just watch and enjoy.For that reasonability up to the end, and some funny text lines which made me giggle, I mark Crush Crush with 8 moist dreams out of 10 (well, the bear and killer babies were a bit off for me)."
,Recommended,459820,29666275,Posted: 3 February,all,Yoshino,Have you ever wanted to date a bear?Lucky for you in this game you can!Also the writing is phenomenal and the game is super addicting... But mostly the bear thing.MOIST
,Recommended,459820,30236971,Posted: 28 February,all,Baron Young,"SPOILER WARNING!How should I put it... this game is actually like one of those Facebook ""waiting game"" and a clicker game cleverly disguised as a dating sim. When you actually have the game opened, your time will be spent getting the required criteria to ""level up"" your relationship with a girl. When you run out of money or lack the skill level to further improve relationships, you'll need to earn (in-game) money and train your skills, which happen in real time. Therefore, you can either leave the game idle or just close the game with the meters running; you'll reap the rewards the next time you open the game.So here's the thing: while I said it's a cleverly disguised dating sim, it is not, in fact, a dating sim. That's because your ultimate goal is to max out the relationship with all the available girls, so you don't really make any important choices like picking one girl over the other. There are no negative choices you can make that will ruin your relationship with any girl, no quizzes with right and wrong answers. It's just a grind from start to finish, rinse and repeat kind of game. Probably the only things you do in this game are clicking on the girls for hearts(which is something easily accomplished with an auto-clicker software)and planning your activities efficiently, the latter which gets stale late game when you have more than enough time blocks.The plus side about this gem is that it has a somewhat nice art style. That, and the girls' not-so-subtle reference to modern pop culture. You have your standard line-up of atsundere, a gamer girl, and a ""cosplaying"" cat girl, but there are also girls who are also right out of other genres (SPOILERS!:Ayano is from the Yandere Simulator game, Iro is a reference to Rainbow Dash from the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic cartoon, etc.) so if you're a modern day geek like me, you'd give the game points just for those.I would recommend this game, since it's free anyway; you have nothing to lose but your virginity. Wait, scratch that last part..."
,Not Recommended,459820,29487253,Posted: 25 January,all,Holysword,"Idle Games all follow the same pattern. You have resources (time), you allocate these resources to gather goods (money or hobby levels), you use goods to gather more resources (more time blocks). You hit a ceiling at some point in which more resources cannot be obtained; then you ""reset"" and in the next incarnation certain benefits take place (prestige bonus) that allow you to break through the previous ceiling.This category of game is very little about gaming, and more about managing resources and achievement hunting. Usually the premise doesn't play any role, but CrushCrush tries to shine in its market by offering the ""dating simulator"" premise (which is VERY questionable), kawaii waifus and a very, very, VERY pink interface. But by far the most attractive point of CrushCrush is the fact that it is ""F2P"". Quotes intended.As I said, the premise doesn't matter for this kind of game, but it has its touch of humour at some points which is a plus. The art is okay, awkward sometimes. What kills it - beware my friends - is the fact that there is a limit in ""resetting"". And it is not of the reasonable kind.After the obtaining the modest 2048 multiplier, your resets give you no further benefit and by all means there is not a reason to reset anymore. Alternatively... you can keep going further by affording Speed Boosts in the ""$$$ Store <3"". Of f***ing course. Let me give you an idea ofhow badit is, shall I? So if you spend, let's say, 10$-ish and get a x64 Speed Bonus, you'll have a 2048x64 multiplier. Having in mind the wooping 2048x8192 multiplier, it doesn't take a genious to realize that Speed Bonuses areabsolutely necessaryfor this game. As a F2P you can afford some of these Speed Boosts with bonuses you get along the game, but nowhere near the 8192. Sadly, I did buy the bonus at the beginning before I realized that this game was unreasonably unbalanced.Don't go on trying to defend the game devs by throwing the ""it is supposed to last forever!!"" kind of cards. According to the maths in the official forums, a F2P player would need, after obtaining the maximum Prestige and free Speed Bonus, 2 years to unlock the last two girls. I am not talking about two years of fun, dedication and love. I am talking about two years ofnot playing the game, because there is absolutelynothingmore to do there, other thanwaiting two bloody years. Even for a game that it is*not*about gaming, this has crossed the line between the ""lulz"" and the ""wth? O.o""Advice to the devs: tune your game down, Karma and Sutra are unreasonable. It takes about a week for someone with MAXED stats to get Golden Slippers. I'd wait a week if your game had something else to offer during this week, but when instead it literally tells me ""forget me, come back next week"" I might as well not come back at all. Lift the Prestige Bonus Limit, or at least raise it. A Lot. Add more girls in between Karma and Luna to help F2P to farm Diamonds for Speed Boosts.Also, personal advice: this game is hosted somewhere else, a website which has been rumoured to scam customers with ""fake drop ratios"" for some of the other games they host. I have witnessed some of it myself and ever since never logged back."

The art is done well, very time consuming (it's a clicker so of course it is, don't be stupid). It's very upfront about what it is, so I don't get why people are giving negative reviews, I read one that said all clickers are the same that they all just require clicking allocating time and managing what you level then get a prestiege... So if you're going to say exactly what a clicker is then put almost 100 hours in just to cry about it being a clicker, don't get the game XD little kids / immature morons reviewing games are amusing because how brain dead the review is...Any who, if a dev is reading this, there's a glitch for people who go into offline mode. Seeing the game requires internet the timers don't function correctly seeing it can't update to the real time of steam (im guessing is whats going on), but the pictures start freaking out at times, like they will freeze or fast forward occassionally I was seeing. (I haven't played in awhile so it might be fixed or it might have just been something going on on my side, but figured I'd mention it)."

But unfortunately, you'd be terribly mistaken. Because as of writing this review; there isn't any nudity.""Crush Crush; yet another clicker game that demands you to waste your life sitting in a chair in your room clicking your mouse furiously with the ultimate reward of wasting your life.""Now for such a game, you'd think that it surely should have nudity. No. It doesn't.So, what is the point of this game then? Well, the point of this game is to spend roughly two hours of sitting in your chair, secluded in your room, clicking furiously trying to woo this girl becuase you think that you will be rewarded with a pair of jugs. Nope. After roughly two hours (it really depends on how enthusiastice you are on seeing those jugs....not that there is any) All that happens is you achieve the status of her being your girlfriend. But once you have made her your girlfriend, what the hell do you do now? There is no more progression after that; unless you want to start all over with one of the other girls (which there are plenty of). But i''m sure as hell not sitting here, furiously clicking on my mouse for roughly two hours, when i don't even get to see the slightest piece of nudity in the end. Therefore, it really is rather pointless and is undoubtedly, a waste of time and, your life.But that isn't all there is to the game! There is music and there is sound effects, though unsurprisingly, it is rather gay sounding; thankfully though, you can easily mute it on and off.So, i've shared my piece on the games nudity, but that pretty much sums the game up itself in that paragraph. What do you do in the game? In layman terms, Crush Crush is a girlfriend simulator. You start off with a girl that you coincedentally meet somehow, and your ultimate goal is to keeping wooing her until you reach the status of her being your girlfriend. That's all. Naturally, as you progress through the different stages of the relationship (acquaintances, frenemies, crush, girlfriend) you require more points and skill points in order to advance. That is either a hell of a lot of clicking, or just wait 'till you have enough money from your job, and then take her to the movies which usually gives you all the points you need. But apart from the points, i also mentioned skill points; which you gain from hobbies that you undertake. In some cases, you need a certain skill point level to progress with a girl. You also need to have a job that they want. So, you need to change jobs frequently to meet their needs, obviously, different jobs have different income which you can spend on gifts and dates.The game really is self explanatory in it's own way, so you don't need an instruction manual on how to play the thing.That's about all there is to the game. You spend hours wooing a girl and you get nothing in return. Oh i suppose you get achievements, maybe you want to get a 100% achievement rating for a game; in that case, this game shouldn't be too hard to get that achievement.But the game itself, really is pointless. Unless they release a nudity mod/patch or whatever, which quite possible could happen, (nowing the weeaboo community). But then again, it's a lot easier and quicker to just go on Google Images and search up hentai.Crush Crush is free, so there is no harm in giving it a try, but; what on earth is the point of it?"

Fantastic dialogue, the characters are unique, and the art is enjoyable. All these exceeded my expectations for a free game, and because of that, I actually spent a bit of money. Support people that do good work.That being said, I've reached the point where it is unplayable. Some quick math shows I'd need to spend $100 to make it much further, and I haven't even unlocked the last two characters yet. If I spend $10 in the free to play game's store, I expect to be able to reach the finish line in under a year.I guess it is closer to a thumbs up than a thumbs down, but this is a lame finish to what started off as interesting.P.S. Anyone complaining about lack of nudity needs to familiarize themselves with the rest of the Internet.PPS.

I played this game, determined to unlock Yan-chan...and much to my surprise, I found that I was enjoying the game before I had unlocked the special character.Don't get me wrong: Crush Crush is an idle clicker game. If you don't like those, you won't like this game. But if you like idle clicking games, this one is pretty good. It has funny writing, memorable characters (especially Bearverly), and the beginnings of a story arc near the end. I definitely recommend checking it out."

But for the madness that is Crush Crush, I feel with the time I have invested in it, I am obligated to do so.I love Crush Crush for it's art, it's humor, and it's gosh darn addictive quality (Having played every single version from the Kongregrate original on the day it first came out to the Steam Version also on the day it first came out to the Nutaku version also you guessed it, on the first release day) . Having invested at least over a day in active play time with this version (And possibly a lot more in the kongregate version and less in the Nutaku version since I wasn't in the mood for a grind) and with the two last girls still on my to do list, I can personally say I've invested a lot of time into this game. As for the recommendation?Well that's a bit more of complex subject. Although I love this game and I hate to say it, but that recomandation is based on my personal style of play. So you only need to ask yourself a few questions as to whether or not Crush Crush is for you;1) Are you a perfectionist?2) Do you have free time?3) Are you addicted to achievements?4) Do you like anime waifus?If you anwsered yes to one or more of the above questions, congrats, Crush Crush is for you.So here comes the part where I lay into Crush Crush...So the biggest problem I have and many others like me, is that the difficulty curve for this game, in particular at the end game, is H*CKING high. You will grind, you will farm, you will grovel on your knees and beg for mercy. But those last two girls Karma and Sutra will burn your soul alive. (And Luna to because the mystical slippers literally can not be bought without a massive grind of cash or forking over a diamond). I am not joking in saying that despite having near max multiplier AND store diamond based multipliers, it STILL takes a silly amount of time to get anything done for those last two girls. The difficulty curve is just to darn high. That in itself is my only real complaint for the game. I love everything else. But if your not playing this for the long haul and or are not willing to fork some real life cash for diamonds, the end game hell awaits you. (Which technically is my other complaint but I don't mind forking over a little cash to help the devs.)(But seriously, I love this game and recommend you give it a go. Just don't expect any breaks once you get to the end game because buddy, your in it for the long haul.)"
