But as a Wildlife Biologist, I took a bite for the laughs.I could go into how poor the game quality is, but I really want to go into the message. As apparently one of the people this game is dedicated to, I’m a little disgruntled. The creators of this game have no understanding of how wildlife conservation works in the United States. Quick fact: the majority of funds raised for nature conservation comes from the tax (that hunters requested to exist in the 30s and 50s) on guns, gear, and general such goods for wildlife hunting. There aren’t even taxes on non-hunting, wildlife-viewing, products like binoculars and bird guides. Most of my work is funded through the tax we impose on hunters who spend a lot of money on hunting gear, tags, lotteries for tags, and other such things.Not only does most conservation money come from hunting, but a good portion of conservation efforts are done voluntarily by hunters. I mean, paying for hunting is kind of paying to volunteer in areas where deer are so overpopulated that they are starving to death or are causing other species of flora and fauna to go extinct.Honestly, I could go on for days about how hunting and hunters are actually more useful than wildlife activists. Unless that wildlife activist becomes a wildlife biologist like me, they usually do not donate or volunteer nearly as much as a hunter does.So please. If you really want to help wildlife, do your research. Also, maybe donate money from this game to The Wildlife Conservation Society, Ducks Unlimited, or a state Fish and Game department."

After finishing it there are some things I would like to share that I would have liked to know going in.  Do not go into it expecting insane puzzles, or crazy action that a lot of indie games love to shove in games to pander to an audience.When you purchase this game, you are purchasing three things.You are buying an atmosphere.  At first it seems a little creepy but by the end you will be wishing there was more.You are buying a story.  It's not an over the top story can't believe.  It's a story you wish you were a part of.You are buying uniqueness.  I have played games like this but they were always a puzzle game where it's an hour long game that takes you 8 hours to beat because of backtracking.  Deer man says screw that gimmick, here's the story, enjoy.  I've never had a game just deliver just a story and still feel like im playing a game.The only downsides that I have seen are it's lenth.  I completed it in 45 minutes and half of that was trying to figure out what to do in the first chapter.  But for the price definately worth picking up!I recommend this game ten times over.  I will be following this developer for sure for any future titles that they come up with."

This has about as much substance as a free-to-play flash game, but not nearly enough to sell as a stand-alone product.As for the game itself, it's nothing special. I knew what it was (more or less) when I started playing it, so I didn't feel let down by the simple walking-sim game mechanics. It was the story that I was disappointed with. A game like this is obviously just supposed to be an interactive story, and I generally love games like these... except when the story is garbage.Obviously this will all come to down to personal opinion, but I found the story to be preachy and, frankly, downright stupid. I don't want to *spoil* anything in the simplistic, bleeding-heart plot, but definitely don't go into this expecting anything profound or emotionally significant. It really just felt like an animal-activist circle-jerk. We get it, you feel emotionally superior for loving animals and choosing life and blah blah blah... but you pickeddeerof all animals to guilt-trip your shallow point across your players.I'm going to get a lot of dislikes on this for being cold or whatever, but it's not like this is an interactive Bambi. It doesn't center around some magical deer family oozing with sorrow and deep-seated deer emotion.On top of that, the game bugged out on my first playthrough. There's not enough going on in it to justify that.tl;dr - don't buy. It's despicable that they're charging for this, and I feel like a chump for paying for it."

This time around the game just has too many bugs, and the game play follows no path of logic that I know. After being ejected from the game about halfway all the remaining chapters were opened. I was able to see the remainder and the ending, and I don't even know what I may have missed.If you do buy this game and play with a controller, be aware that the controller buttons were ALL wrong, referring specifically to keyboard keys. (""X"" means ""A"".) From what I read the game is only about 20 minutes long. The hour I put in was an attempt to follow a questionable logic (and I wasn't alone.)The music was nice.I'd rather not go any further, as the DEV seemed generally to be a decent person, and very attentive (except to bugs.)Thank you."

Never before have I had such drastic mood changes in a 20 minute period. Deer Man will create a sense of curiosity, strike fear in your heart, following it up with a feeling of understanding and sympathy, leading into anger, then back into fear. At then end you are guarenteed to cry.Thats all a bit of an exaggeration, but on a serious note I really enjoed this game. Very worth the two dollars I paid for it. The atmosphere is reallly brought to life by the creative style and music. The message is actually very heart felt. I will be looking at the future works of this developer for sure. For anyone who likes cinematic and story driven indie games, I highly suggest trying it. Its relaxing and intersting."

It's a walking simulator game with weather effects (snow drifts, flies buzz, etc) and a run-function, and it doesn't set my computer on fire. That alone would sell me on this game.However, what makes me a little ambivalent is the moral of the game. The deer man is a dude in a mask, running around trying to scare hunters because once he was a substinance hunter who shot a mother deer and his heart broke when he saw her fawn curling up beside her.Apart from the fact that this ostensibly takes place in America, where female deer generally don't have horns, I am really close to this subject matter. I grew up in the middle of the North American woods, specifically in a very poor, very rural area where the schools all closed down on the first day of deer season. While we weren't necessarily dependent on deer hunting for food, most families in the area used venison to suplement the food they did eat. There were some trophy hunders, only looking to score eight-points and above, but almost everyone had a reason for hunting. Even though I despise the ""sport,"" (it's boring, it's cold, and I don't like killing animals) I understand why people hunted.This is an especially big deal because the story takes place in the middle of winter. Most of the trophy hunters have moved on by the time winter rolls around. You don't run around in -5 degree weather for the fun of it. The fact that the deer man himself was out trying to feed his family when he killed a mama deer should stop him from being too moralistic. What happened to his family after he threw down his gun and ran away? Did they starve? Did they run off to become deer people too? We never find out because the game doesn't care to follow up on them.I looked it up, and Red Mount Media, the people who developed this game, are based in the Johar Town district of Lahore, Pakistan--the wealthiest neighborhood of the second largest city in Pakistan. I don't want to make snap judgements, but it's very easy to moralise about the travesty of hunting when you have money.Oh, and by the way, deer hunting is regulated in North America, and often the hunting is condoned because the deer population is super resilient and constantly growing so large it disrupts the rest of the ecosystem. Many years, you either hunt them or they strip the area of food and slowly starve."

Unfortunatly the game keeps crashing on me in the third chapter, so I cannot finish it.To be honest, I doubt I am missing much. The scope and content is not more than a free flashgame and really not worth a game on its own. But it is the over simplified message and preachy tone, which really makes it not worth playing.I do work in the biologist field and can say that conservation efforts are a bit more complicated than ""hunting bad - poor deer."" I guess the intentions are well, but it is naive and childish storytelling. It is also never a good sign, when a game has to tell me that I should be inspired by its story.Good Soundtrack though!"

Instead of rolling the frames, you're given a limited amount of freedom to decide where to go.While the story cuts down very early, I think you should jump into this game with the knowledge that it is more a call to action on its subject rather than being a 'game'.

With the abundance of first person shooters and RPGs gamers are used to playing. This game does something different. It's a linear exploration game that is similar to ""Gone Home"", except much shorter and fewer items to collect. The game is set in a snowy forest that is focused on an unseen hiker named Jacob. Jacob loves traveling to the wilderness to hike where all is calm and the only creatures present are the deer. During his hike, he will soon discover that there are more than just deer roaming in the wild. As an anthropomorphic deer is spotted within Jacob's site. Is this ""Deer Man"" friend or foe? As you play the game you learn more of the so called ""Deer Man"" through narration and the walkthrough of the game. The less said about the whole plot the better. As I want you to play the game for yourself to discover. Deer Man is a very well done ""visual"" short story game. The plot is something straight out of a Jack London story. The lack of colors and heavy use of white help gave it an impression that you are miles from civilization. Causal gamers won't likely to enjoy this game due to the length of gameplay and lack of enemies to fight. Indie game fans and English major students however will enjoy what the game was trying to achieve. Deer Man provided a great message about wildlife preservation and I am glad to of played it."

Though it has not much gameplay it still lets you expeirence a lot of emotions in the sitting. It's pretty easy to understand what you have to do in the game and it lets you adventure. There is a good amountof things you can find down paths and when you find what you were looking for it feels great. It got me really emotional while playing and I must say the voice during the game sounded awesome. I do admit that at one part I did get stuck or got frustrated that the game had started over from me making a mistake. Though those problems were just from me not realizing that I had to do something or go somewhere. I easily found out what I had to do after a little while. While it had some issues I think it was a wonderful story! I would also like to apoligize if I had made a mistake during this review. It happens to be one of the most serious reviews I have done (because this game is awesome!)
76561197976341931,Recommended,459940,22592113,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,Ｊａｍｉｅセトの動物,"Full disclosure: I am writing this review as per developer request. It has not affected my overall opinion.There is a lot that I like about Deer Man, and a lot that I don't. The positive and negative elements are woven together to make a back-and-forth, slightly confusing overall experience. I wasn't really sure of my opinion on this game until I took some time to think about it.Deer Man is roughly divided into two halves. In the first half, the player explores a section of woods for interactable items, and the second half is walking through linear set pieces. This is an interesting structure, since usually walking sims like Deer Man do one, or the other. I think this has a positive impact, but it means the strengths and weaknesses of the two parts are different, and must be analyzed individually.First off, the art is a mixed bag. The game uses an art style with smooth black-and-white assets evocative of silhouettes but with more detailed small objects. It's not particularly original, but it works well with the abstract storytelling here. The game does suffer from a lack of assets as a whole however. There are only two deer models, a stag and a fawn. This could be fine, but it contradicts a point in the game where a young fawn lays sadly next to its dying stag ""mother."" Secondly, I couldn't tell the difference between trees (assuming there IS more than one tree model), which caused a lot of problems with navigation, especially in the first half. Uniform trees and a short field of vision means that it is hard to find story hotspots unless you walk right into them. It means that I had to comb over the map like a grid, rather than exploring it like the mysterious forest it was supposed to be.The navigation problem isn't solely because of the lack of assets, there is also some questionable level design. The open first half doesn't have much in the way of landmarks, and the story hotspots are a bit too spread out to have a real sense of organized progression through the level. Thankfully, the protagonist says a line whenever you're far away from a hotspot, meaning it's hard to get truly lost. The second half, while easier to navigate, is more linear than its design would suggest. In one set piece, the game spawned me facing the wrong way, and I quickly walked up to a floating sign that said essentially: ""there is no content here."" During this second half, I found myself accidentally walking the wrong way, or into invisible walls more frequently than is comfortable. Two of the interactive parts suffer from this problem as well. At one point you have to cross a frozen lake as it fractures into a maze, but invisible walls prevented me from crossing since I walked too far to the left. Immediately after, a herd of deer charge at you, but the area is so wide open that you can anticlimactically sidestep the entire herd. Overall, the levels could have used some more fine-tuning.The story is the most interesting part of Deer Man. The first story event, Deer Man chasing you down, is positively delightful. You can outrun him for a very long time, and hiding from him and the subsequent ambush is very tense. After that though, the story runs into a few problems. First off, Deer Man tells you that he was originally a hunter, killing deer to provide for his family, and had a change of heart when he saw a sad fawn. Now instead of hunting, he attacks hunters. This is a contradiction, since Deer Man says that he didn't have enough food to survive without meat from deer. Did he let his family starve? If the shack in the woods is his, why is his wife's suitcase laying abandoned in the woods? This is a suspicious oversight. Secondly, the fact that the hunter that killed Deer Man was let off was surprising to me, but after some thought it made sense. Running around in a hunting area dressed in a deer costume would be considered borderline suicidal. It wouldn't be difficult to clear up that the hunter didn't intend to kill another human, although he may be traumatized because of it. Lastly, it seems strange that the protagonist would be so attached to Deer Man. He knew him for about a half hour, then he was promptly killed. I think most people would be disturbed by this memory, and would probably avoid forests from then on because of it. Instead, the protagonist has a quasi-religious experience, and is filled with a sense of wonder and love towards nature. It just seems a little unrealistic.I also want to mention that the politics of hunting are not as cut-and-dry as this game represents. Deer don't have many natural predators living in the wild anymore, so without hunters they would quickly overpopulate certain areas. When deer are overpopulated, they run out of food, mess with humans, and generally cause suffering within their own population. In the long run, responsible hunting actually benefits human and deer populations. This, combined with the problematic story elements would cause me to dislike this game story, IF it were actually about deer. However, if you look at the Steam page for this game, you can see that it is ""Inspired from the wildlife, The Virunga National Park in Congo, where rangers are risking their lives to protect morning gorillas."" When analyzing the game as a metaphor for poaching (very different from hunting), it suddenly makes a lot more sense. I can get behind this story as a narrative discouraging poaching, even if many of the elements don't translate properly.In conclusion, I would hesitate to say that Deer Man is a great game within its genre, but it still has several positive qualities. The music and atmosphere is above average, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. There are a number of better free walking sims out there, but if you have played them already and are a nature lover, Deer Man is worth a couple bucks (deer puns LOL)."

,Recommended,459940,29946154,Posted: 15 February,all,RoninOtter,"The short of it:A short interactive story with a preachy message that animal lovers who over-simplify nature will enjoy.  The gameplay has no challenge to it, and the atmosphere is probably best described as ""contemplative exploration with a slight unease.""  The extremely short duration means it serves as little more than a brief distraction, but the low price matches what it delivers.  It's short and cheap, and some people won't mind playing it once or twice so I'd feel bad giving it a thumb down.  On the other hand, I can't really say I'd tell someone ""You should really play this"" so take my ""recommendation"" with a grain of salt.The long of it:It's basically a story of a hunterwho kills Bambi's mom, then has a nightmare which causes him to turn vigilante and scare hunters away from killing the deer.  The graphics are simple and stylized, with a decided ""Slender man mobile app"" look and feel in terms of the way the environment appears.  Nothing special about how it looks, or how it plays, and so it ends up leaning on the music for providing most of the atmosphere.  The sountrack is ambient, simple, and actually does a nice job feeding the mood.  You'll walk, run, find a couple items, open a door or two, and interact with a handful of things.  There's one exception whereyou fire at a deer through a scopebut that's the extent of the gameplay.  The rest is story narration with a better-than-average but still decidedly amateur voice actor.""For the love of wildlife"" is a good tagline for it, since the story does its best to pull at the heartstrings of animal lovers with a frequently used story element.  The story does, however, enforce some very incorrect assumptions about game hunting, and uses emotional response to support a morality which is based upon an extremely overly-simplified view of how ecosystems work, and is a viewpoint which can actually harm wildlife more than help them.  Staying off my ecological sandbox, however, it actually introduces a significant problem with the story.  Your mileage may vary.For one,the hunter was only hunting deer to feed his family.  However, when he has his ""epiphahy"" during the dream, his wife and child(ren) are suddenly no longer mentioned.  He lives alone and we never hear why.  Did his family starve to death because he stopped hunting for them?  Did he abandon them entirely to become ""The Deer Man"" and their fates are unknown even to him?None of these are answered, so there's a lot of holes in the The Deer Man's story which leave us questioning his origin and morality.  Now,had he been a trophy hunter who had killed game without need for sustenance, his epiphany would be much more significant and powerful, as it would have meant that he'd made a complete moral 180 in his head.  Instead, the father trying to feed his family suddenly decides that the deer are more important to him than them, and their fates go completely unmentioned.  Without even some sort of explanation for what happened to them, it's very hard to see The Deer Man as a positive influence, given that one potenial explanation is that he abandoned his family to die in the woods so he could live alone wearing a deer mask.SOAPBOX ALERT:  If you truly want to say that you love nature, you need to embrace the fact that it doesn't always fit your emotional desires.  Otherwise, you're merely nature's ""fair weather friend.""  The reality is that responsible game hunting and apex predators are both things which ultimately are a functional part of the ecosystem, and contribute to the overall health and sustainability of the natural world.  Nature is sometimes harsh, and we (if we truly wish to be part of nature) will sometimes find ourselves in that position.  Granted, I'd find it almost impossible to be a hunter myself becauseI'm definitely one of the people who gets teary-eyed seeing Bambi's mom die, but I hold no grudge against those who hunt purely for sustenance and keeping prey animals from destroying all of the vegetation in the localized ecosystem.  (Check out the video on all the unexpected benefits that happened when wolves were reintroduced to wildlife preserves.)Trophyhunting, however, I have no sympathy for.  Those people have no souls.

And the controls are absolutely terrible and not always responsive.  You open a container to see clothes inside, you pick up an axe, you re-arrange deer paintings on the wall.  I have no idea why I did those things other than give you busy work in a game.  You collect freaking antlers!However, the story is actually good.  And the atmosphere the game creates in such a short period is also not just good, but immersive (which VR titles should be).  You start running along and you feel like the you are the protaganist in the story.  Spoiler alert:I felt like Deer Man, I got why I, as the protaganist would feel a sense of keeping up the ethos of the Deer manYou don't have to agree with the moral of the story.

The atmosphere, the music, the story plays well with eachother to make a great game. In a sense, this game would not have the same impact if it was an hour long. The end does seem to be rushed due to the shortness, but if you get past that it's fine.The only critisim I have is part of the story. The origin of the Deer Man should have been a hunter that hunted for sport or one of those who only hunt to get their antlers and leave the corpse. This would have made more sense with what lead him to become Deer Man. Him trying to provide food for his family that is trying to survive and stopping to brings you to think what happened to his family (Did he abandon them? Did they survive?). If Deer Man was a hunter for sport or only killed for antlers would have made the impact more affective and the origins wouldn't bring the obvious consequences that could have happened (and can explain why he turned his way quickly better).As antlers were added, and an achievement is dedicated towards collecting all 20, the antlers on the last chapter will be the hardest! The only thing I have a problem with is that the anters are the same color as the cottage, which causes the player to have a difficult time to notice unless it was by accident (like I did). I do appreciate you don't have to get all in one playthrough.I recommend this game as it is worth to pay a couple bucks.

However, as I don't own an Oculus Rift, I tried to make the game work on my HTC Vive (following the usually-reliable Revive method presented by the developer of LibreVR).Alas, this didn't work, which is a shame. Even with the patch DLLs installed properly and Steam's ""Desktop Game Theatre"" disabled, the only place Deer Man would appear was on my monitor... even when I selected the startup option of ""Play in Other VR Headset"". But as the author has never claimed this works on a Vive, no harm, no foul. However, since I'd spent the money, I decided that I'd go ahead and try it on the monitor with the Xbox One controller.Well... I really wanted to like this game/experience. I don't mind things being atmospheric and experimental, so I was prepared to give it a fair bit of leeway. To lead with the positives, I did like the minimalist visuals -- even if they do grow a bit repetitive after you've seen the same tree and deer hundreds of times -- and the voice acting was measured and hardly off-putting.However, as I carried on, I kept feeling that there should be considerably more happening. As the story progressed -- at a pace that may have strayed beyond merely ""peaceful"" and into ""glacial"" territory -- I kept thinking, ""Surely I'm missing something here. The whole point of this can't be simply to collect some antlers, poke my nose into a few desolate places, and hope to walk through the woods long enough to trigger the next stage of the narrative?""Unfortunately, if there was a greater pay-off than this (and, of course, the background story told by the hunter), I never encountered it. This is because the game crashed randomly about half an hour in and as there hadn't been any obvious save points along the way, I didn't feel up to starting over from scratch to pick up the remaining thread of the plot.As such, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game in its present state. I think it has potential and if there were more actual gameplay or story it might be worth the asking price. As it stands, it would probably be more appropriate as a portfolio piece for the author to let people download free from a personal website promoting future work."

Sadly I can't so I'm getting a refund and hopefully warning you guys to stay away from this terrible game. People are saying the environments nice and stuff but its just a snow white ground and the same colored trees throughout the game. I guess you could call it an A E S T H E T I C. Anyway the plot is just as thin and badly thought out as a 20 minute game can get. I can sum up the game in like three sentences. You find deer man, he tells you a story about how he became deer man because he shot a deer who had a baby, so now he fights hunters. You follow deer man to fight a hunter, and he gets shot. You then become deer man for some reason??? The plot really doesn't make sense. You know absolutely nothing about the narrator other then the fact that hes out for a jog. He doesn't seem like hes lost, or loves nature or anything. And then he just gives up everything for these deer? Like it makes absolutely no sense. And then that is the end of the game. Thankfully this game didn't last for over an hour because I can give it back now and get my money back.TLDR version: The graphics are meh, the story is terrible, and the game is short. Don't Buy this under any circumstances."

This game is stupid. It makes hunters out to be the bad guy when in reality they are food put here on this Earth for us to eat. Furthermore, hunters kill their prey in one of the most humane ways possible, if the developer wants to make a statement they should go film a McDonalds' and take a look how they treat and slaughter their animals. So tired of this liberal crap. Wasted 2$ to waste my life on something i would not have done if you paid me 2$. 0/10 stop making stupid statements!!! Btw, the purpose of life is not to run with Deer."

I can't believe that it was ment to be serious, eye-opening experience.Even though I complited the game in about half an hour it managed to crash twice durning ths time.The only plus of this game is an art style."

It kinda doen't make a lot of sense if you really think about it, but you won't notice unless you think about it for a while. Worth the cost, fine game."
,Recommended,459940,33391969,Posted: 8 July,all,Tigra Watanabe,"Nice Story, but Deer are not a good Example, because they are Prey, not just hunted by Humans.I think hunting is ok, if you need it.That Hunter has need it to feed his Family.The Story has an big Error in the Logic, because the Hunter is Hunting in the Winter and in the Winter are no Fawns anymore arround who need their Mother and the ""Mother"" there's a Male (Females have no Antlers).Don't think I don't understand the Message behind it.It's not good to kill Animals for no Reason, for Sport, Tropys or because they eat what the Human just want for themself.Deers need to be hunted, because the Predators who hunt them are gone and the Deers can destroy a Forrest if there are to much.Myself I think, wildlife has a much better Life as the Animals the Humans use, like Cows, Pigs or Chicken.Maybe you should made a Game for them too, so People not use Flesh from Mass Production."
,Not Recommended,459940,33778246,Posted: 24 July,all,WildCrd007,I liked the basic art design of the level but the brown blends into itself so much I can't see definition very well. The story seemed odd but a little interesting. The game froze and crashed on me in the middle of a chapter. I loaded up a chapter to try and get an achievement but when I walked near the river the game froze up on me again. I could get back to the menu but not continue the chapter. Asking for refund for 2 many bugs in such a short amount of gameplay. End thoughts are the story isn't interesting enough to continue playing through the bugs.
