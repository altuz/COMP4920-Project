76561197968605797,Recommended,460150,22310919,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,Cocaine,"“One Last Chance” is a very short visual novel, 30-40 minutes for a single playthrough assuming you listen to all the voiceover. There are 6 possible endings though, so there is definitely replay value for you adventure hunters out there. Personally, I liked it, the art style was nice, the music was gorgeous and I felt the voice acting really gave it a more human touch.It may not be for everyone as it’s clean (no sexual content) and is surprisingly deep at times (the tone is light at the beginning but becomes a bit heavier as the story progresses).Recommended 7 out of 10"
,Recommended,460150,22340140,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,Silviu,"This one was a rather surprising VN really. Not like a lot of the other ones I have played in the past, not at all, and I like that a lot. We are presented with a protagonist who is seemingly a very normal man, a salesman in the steel pipes business, this is clearly done to show us that he’s an everyman that any of us can identify with. The story is about him meeting up with a lost love on a business trip and depending on what your decisions are during the trip, different outcomes happen. Now this is not a surprise as that is what Visual Novels are about, the surprising bit is how staunch and strong the ideals and views of the characters are. In this type of “pretty” VN you’d rarely get characters that have such definite ideals and convictions, and for me that makes this a real diamond in the rough. I applaud the developers and publishers for publishing such a game, as I know many studios may feel that it would be quite risky to do so.As for production values it seems nice enough and a lot of the other reviewers have already touched on that so I don’t want to repeat what they’ve said. One of the other reviewers said she found a bug in the game but I’ve had a few playthroughs and so far nothing! Maybe the developers already fixed it!"
,Not Recommended,460150,30952228,Posted: 4 April,all,Ceaseless Duality,"There is nothing nice to say about this VN. I tried to think of something nice to say, but I just can't come up with anything.Let's see ...- Subpar writing- Boring story plot- Boring characters- Poor story-telling methods for character development- A lot of choices seem arbitrary in how they affect the ending(s)- All playthroughs are alike with the exception of slight dialogue changes from different choices and the endings are just a paragraph epilogue- Skip mode skips everything, not just read text- The credits are particularly slow and seemingly unskippable- The last achievement is glitched- This is supposed to be a romance VN, but because the story doesn't get you to care about the characters, it doesn't elicit any kind of emotional reaction while readingTo be fair, I didn't play it with sound, so I suppose the music and voice acting might be okay, but even if it is, it wouldn't be enough to redeem itself."

But the story and its characters… Err.The story is really short and everything is so forced. Tara is an annoying character, and I couldn’t care less about her. The endings were also rushed. Oh, and there’s the VA; it wasterrible. Like really, really bad. The text is also a pain to read; to be honest it’s almost unreadable. I don’t mind the Tyrano engine, I know it’s a very basic one and that’s ok. The problem here was the story, dialogue, and the choice of font colors.2/10."

It's more than just a story of a man rekindling his love for his long-lost childhood friend; it's also a simple reminder that in the midst of the complications of the modern adult world, we can always go back to simpler times and rediscover ourselves.And yes, I will support any VN with English voice acting."

The character drawings, voicing and music really gives dimension to the each character. what let's it down a little bit is the basic interface."
76561198209916711,Recommended,460150,24493656,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,Comodo,"A short Visual Novel that would make you think on what could've happened with your high school crush. It answers questions that you wanted to ask, but never got the chance to answer. What if you got another chance? What would you do if you saw your high school crush? Would you want to tell them that you loved them?"
,Recommended,460150,24562504,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,strayseer,"While my VN reviews tend to focus on the story, that will not be the case with One Last Chance. That's because the story is really simple and the characters are nice, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, what stands out about this game is its execution. On the bright side, art is pretty nice and the game has full voice acting (...well, almost. Except for the protag), which is a pleasant surprise for English VNs.On the other hand, however... dialogue tends to be the same regardless of what option you pick, which makes it a little hard to know what direction you're going towards until you finally reach the end. You'll probably need to check a guide to finish it. The fact that dialogue is so repetitive and the only thing that changes is the ending makes it a little tiring and boring to replay in order to get the different endings/achievements. It is also very, very short (I have nearly 3 hours on it because it took me a while to figure out 3 of the endings, since the only guide on Steam didn't work on those for me, but my first playthrough took only about 30 minutes), so while it is definitely not expensive, it is still a little pricey considering what you get.If possible, I recommend you get it on sale. One Last Chance is a nice little visual novel, but that's as far as it goes given its ordinary story and execution issues. 6/10"

,Recommended,460150,30312632,Posted: 4 March,all,Frankenschwein,"It's a bit odd to play an anime styled game without any japanese language spoken, not a single kanji or any sakura/fuji-san backgrounds seen in it. On the other hand the game is quite nice and pleasing. Tidy music and characters. Good job there.Cons are (or ""what i didn't like personaly""):- can't scroll the text backwards, so be carefull not to miss it.- no scene selection. (though can't use it if you're into achievements)- very odd choices you have to make to get differents endings- you just have to add some easter eggs achievements into a game which is made in anime style, but EUElse is alright. Fine. Great."

The story is bland, twee, and I could notstandTara. While the voice actor for her character didn't stumble, the accent and inflection grated on my nerves.While the art is nice enough it can be difficult to read the text. Poor choice of colour for the most part. It doesn't always show up well on top of the background.The music is decent. I don't have much to say for or against it.About the only amusement I got was reading the fishy puns you get to choose from at one point.If this story had a bit more depth then perhaps I would have found it endearing. As it is, I found it about as interesting as listening to some distant cousin complaining about her humdrum social life."
76561198042529108,Recommended,460150,31246243,Posted: 19 April,all,RisingSolarSoul,Pretty good. I enjoyed it. Decent storytelling if not needing an acquired taste. It seems like characters were based off of some form of realism. Requires really using your full brain power to figure out what women want rather than saying what you think progresses the relationship. Character designs are pretty good as you can see.

I guess it can’t be helped if stupid weeaboos who enjoy cookie cutter plots and waifus don’t appreciate it though. I enjoyed how realistic it was, though the game does get a bit political at times and I can see why that may offend some. Fortunately it agreed with my political views, so I’m happy!"

You meet your former high school crush while trying to deal with a business deal that may or may not fall through. Through conversation with her you discover that things are a bit more complicated than they appear. In the end, will you win the girl? Keep your job? Make a fool of yourself?"

The first problem is the audio.  Unless you turn the music all the way down to 0%, the music is way too loud compared to the voice volume, even if you max out the voice.  Ugh.Watch my ""Let's Play"" and Review of this game right here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJK4sxPmpo8The second problem is the voice acting is terrible.  When you hear a totally fake cry, it just comes off really cheesy.But my main problem with this game is the super simple, forced plot that doesn't make you feel anything or care about the character(s) in the story.  It's a rushed, super cheesy plot and just feels ""wrong"" and ""rushed"" in every way.The game was left running accidently while I was afk after I completed the whole game, and one play through the game will likely take you somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes.  It's not a long virtual novel at all.There's no excuse for a visual novel like this that they ask any amount of money for feeling so shallow and ""rushed"".  To compare, the visual novel ""The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns"" is FREE right here on Steam, and is about ten times better then this game.1 out of 10.  Not Recommended."

That said, I really liked this game.  I thought the artwork was well done, and the English voice-overs were very good.  I only spotted a couple of very minor flaws between the voices and the text - certainly not enough to ruin the gameplay.I would have liked for the story to branch out a little more, perhaps involving more of the main character's potential love interests, either from his past or present.  The song at the end also needs work, which I hate to admit, because the vocalist does sound like she could be a really good singer.  I'll also admit the purple-on-black text is not the easiest to read; perhaps a lighter shade of purple or a different color would have been a better choice.Overall, though, for the price, you really can't go wrong with this title.  I will be on the lookout for more VNs from Last Lotus, and I hope they manage to improve on what I consider to be a good game."
