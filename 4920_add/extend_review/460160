It's cheap and you'll find that Front Wing's humor is spot on as always. It's a nice little side story to add to the main visual novel. It's about an hour long, so you'll read it through quickly.If your answer is no, don't even bother. Not trying to turn away any potential fans for Grisaia, absolutely not. It's just that Leisure of Grisaia brings nothing special to people who browse random visual novels. With no real introductions to the characters, it's expected that you should know who the main students that attend Mihama Academy are, since you won't learn much here. If you want to read this, I'd recommend reading some chapters from The Fruit of Grisaia first, at least until you can kind of tell what kind of people the students are.Simply put: it's good, but to make your experience better, check outThe Fruit of Grisaiafirst if you haven't already."

,Recommended,460160,23073146,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,Lysis,"Although it was very exciting seeing the game released in English while I was completely unaware of its localisation (and even more so, that Frontwing had their own localisation team), this game is incredibly short. It focuses more on the laughs and risque moments of the Grisaia series, without much, if any reference to the darker undertones of the Fruits of Grisaia (Grisaia no Kajitsu) visual novel.Without a doubt, I bought it simply as a huge fan of the original visual novel, but if you're not a pretty devoted fan to the Grisaia series, you will almost certainly feel pretty ripped off for the 40-50 minutes of fanservice entertainment that this game provides.So with that I recommend this game, if you know what you're getting into.

,Recommended,460160,25900360,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,☆ AEON ☆ CSGetto.com ☆,"Originally published at:http://vnvortex.co/2016/05/19/the-leisure-of-grisaia-review/The Leisure of Grisaia is a kinetic visual novel developed and published by Frontwing, and it’s a short side-story to The Fruit of Grisaia, taking place along the common route of the original game. It’s available on Windows via Steam for $2.99, without Steam achievements or trading cards.I was a bit hesitant on taking up The Leisure of Grisaia, having not played the original game and full well knowing how I might not be able to get everything out of it due to that. However with the low-ish price and short length, I decided to dive right in. After all, I needed something to go with my morning coffee.Few moments of goofinessLike said before, the kinetic novel takes place along the common route of the original game, and it just throws the reader right in without any introduction of the characters. This clearly implies that it’s all about something that is aimed for the fans of the series, and while it’s possible to get some enjoyment out of the used game jokes and references, it goes without saying that actually knowing the characters and their backgrounds beforehand would be required. But writing from the point of someone who is not familiar with the series, I did not consider my time with The Leisure of Grisaia wasted.Listening though the content takes about an hour, and reading it yourself would cut the time down to 30 minutes or so. Considering the price of $2.99 it’s a little on the higher side, but then again I could easily list a bunch of things that would be worse way to spend an hour or $2.99 for. For a fan of the series the title could easily be recommended as a way to pass little time, but for someone who doesn’t know the cast, it might really be a hit or miss situation. Then again, you can easily complete the whole content and get a refund if you didn’t like it, so it’s not like there is anything to lose – barring one hour of your life.The translation is not completely riddled with errors and typos, but there are enough of those to actually take a notice on them. Occasionally the writing also sounds a bit too literal, too the point of being even a tad awkward, but I don’t think that it’s as bad as some people were fearing it to be. It’s also quite possible that these issues will be fixed with a patch in the future, making it a bit better.Visually the game is exactly the same as The Fruit of Grisaia to a tee, so with prior experience you’ll be right at home, and even without you’ll be greeted with high quality backgrounds and character sprites. Music is not spectacular by any means, but that and the sound effect do their job just fine.In conclusionThe Leisure of Grisaia is a very short and as such leaning a little to the expensive side, but if you liked the original game, and have no better way to spend three bucks, it might be worth it for few giggles. Without previous knowledge of the game one might want to wait for an upcoming sale somewhere in the future and grab it for half the price, seeing how there are no trading cards to make some of the cost back in the first place. Few noticeable issues with the translation do stick out, but otherwise the game works well as a means to pass an hour of time."

The characters are given no introduction here as you're expected to have either read the original visual novel, or watched the anime, which is what this was originally bundled with in Japan.That said, if you have read the original visual novel and enjoyed the comedy, this is something you'll enjoy reading.  The Leisure of Grisaia is a short (about an hour) side story centered around Michiru, Sachi and Makina, with Michiru being the focus character.  Amane and Yumiko both make appearances, though their roles are minor here, and Yuuji is only mentioned in passing a couple of times without making an appearance.As for the cons, well it would have been nice if Yuuji had made even a brief appearance, or even if we had gotten a line or two explaining his rather conspicuous absence (Makina's behavior makes it pretty clear this takes place after his arrival at the academy).  Also, while I do think Leisure is worth the money, it would have been nice to get maybe another hour of content, although that might just be me being greedy.In conclusion, if you're a fan of Grisaia's humor, this is an hour of good laughs, as the humor picks up pretty much right off the bat, and watching the girls go off on tangents just never seems to get old.  It would have been nice if it had been longer, but it's still worth buying regardless."

Listening to it while I take a short break because of the sweetness I'm feeling. Which will drain me lifeless If I don't take a short break for about five minutes. Anyway, the Sound and Music was nice even though the game is short. Nothing else to add here anymore...In the end FRONTWING doesn't fail to amaze us in delivering very concrete, lovable, and enjoyable cast of characters to our virtual moniters (reality is such a b*tch am I right?) and I really respect them for that. Hoping to what they do next would great as well... Here's a list of Pros and Cons.PROS+Characters are the same as before. Really enjoyable.+Music was nice to listen to.+SMEX JOKES ARE ALWAYS OKAY IN MY BOOK!+It's cheap man, what are you even doing!!!+That PLOT, man...CONS-The game is so short, you can even finish it in 30 minutes.-Lack of Yuuji.-The game ends abruptly like that.-Depression cosumes you after finishing it.""I myself reach for the vast sky thinking that the endless stars above, would reach out and grant my sweetful wish"""

It's made to be a fanservice short in the first place anyway, so don't expect the kind of lengthy in-depth story that the main series is known for."

If you've played the Grisaia series and want to help support Frontwing in their future endeavours, then purchase this novel.If you haven't played the Grisaia series, I suggest you avoid purchasing this; as most of the context and character values would be out-of-context and you will not understand the character tropes as well as you should.If you haven't played the Grisaia series but you purchased this anyway... then I hope you enjoy this silly little visual novel and strongly recommend checking out the rest of the novels in the series.

I was hoping for more than 30-35 minutes of content, though, considering the original game is dozens of hours long. I waited several minutes to see if there was a post-credits scene, but no. The story centers primarily on Michiru, Makina, and Sachi but there's a little bit of Amane and Yumiko as well. It's pure comedy with a heavy dose of dirty humor, definitely a few laugh out loud moments. Revisiting Grisaia was very nostalgic, too. Just wish there was more. No achievements or cards, either."

It was a satisfying little romp, but would fall flat if you didn't already love these characters.  If you do love them, you will enjoy this, though be warned; although Amane is shown in the game's banner image, she has the least screen time!"
