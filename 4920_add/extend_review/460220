,Recommended,460220,32834179,Posted: 26 June,all,Anax of Rhodes,"Shmup meets XCOM.Xenoraid provides players a different experience from most shoot-em-ups.  Your ships are valuable not only because you have to retry if you fail a mission: your ships are gone forever, have you recruit new ones to replace them.  You're not blasting enemies with bonkers-sized, infinite-ammo laser bolts.  Your limitations are realistic, and your enemies' are too.  Every hit you endure means fewer credits for you to upgrade with.The campaign is lengthy and brimming with style.  Your pilots' chatter is realistic, and the commanders' discussions are representative of an escalating threat to humanity.Enemy A.I. feels surprisingly accurate.  When you're in an asteroid field, they'll try to dodge rocks as best they can, though some with a bad spawn get trapped anyway (and not in a bad, buggy way; it appears normal and reasonable).  When you cloak up, sneak next to a group of enemies, and buzz them with your proximity shocker, they split, blitzing to the edges of the screen for safety.  When you weaken one side of a cruiser or capital ship, it will re-enter on its strong side, protecting its actual health with another side covered in shielding.Xenoraid is a slower shoot-em-up, to its credit.  It rewards careful, tactical play.  There is no high score; there is only survival."
,Recommended,460220,25922497,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,stubar,"I hadn't heard of this game until I saw a friends review on the front store page in Steam and was immediately intrigued by the angular shooting mechanic.  That's one thing that has always bugged me with shoot 'em ups.  Having to only go head-on with an enemy the traditional way forced very linear battles, either vertical or horizontal.  The big question I had was, would it work?https://youtu.be/iUrQ-uYjjGYA resounding ""Yes!"" is the answer!  Not only does Xenoraid accomplish this original mechanic (I'm not aware of it being used before?) it also implements a whole host of other neat mechanics and manages to create an extremely well-rounded and balanced game!  Design is so important in games and the guys at ""10tons"" have nailed it.There are 5 campaigns which are each broken down into seperate missions.  Each campaign you start with a set of four craft, each quite unique in size, movement, fire power and secondary weapons.  You can upgrade the overall tech of your fleet and also upgrade individual aspects of each ship with credits you accumulate for experience, mission completion or collecting during a mission.  This adds an overall strategy to your game as to how you want to tackle the campaign overall.You can switch between each of your four ships during flight although once you change from one ship it will be subject to a short cooldown period.  You have a small period of invincibility during the change over which can be used to navigate out of tight spots.  You will have to decide on the fly which ship may be best suited to your current situation and also whether to risk a ship that has sustained a lot of damage in battle and risk losing it altogether.  Replacing ships is much more expensive than repairing, especially if you've invested in upgrades for it!The difficulty ramps up perfectly.  I'm currently on campaign 4/5 and it is proving challenging and I am determined to complete it today!  I've got to the end boss but just failed at this hurdle.  There are checkpoints you fall back to but you will have to replace any lost ships to proceed (or continue with a smaller fleet!).Normally in shooters I like to be dazzled by beautiful backdrops, Xenoraid has crisp and clear backdrops but they are quite plain.  This doesn't deter from the experience and I've played games like this before where the background made it tough to accurately determine what is actually going on.  This is never an issue here and I'd much prefer less chaotic backgrounds to taking hits from shots I didn't see because the background was too detailed!The game also has a survival mode where you get to choose one of three worlds and compete in leaderboards against friends/global.  You get a set number of credits to buy a fleet and arm them.  This is something I'd like to have seen implemented in the campaign part of the game.  Maybe they could add this mode as this would add to the replayability.The ships movements in space feel good, they have a small amount of inertia and the larger ships feel heavier.  They all feel solid.All the weapons have a satisfying sound and feel to them.  The background music is a conventional and solid sci-fi theme.It also has a local co-op!!  I've not yet played this mode but I am really looking forward to it!I'd recommend Xenoraid to anyone looking for a thinking man/womans shoot 'em up!"
,Recommended,460220,32026982,Posted: 28 May,all,ImperatorOsiryx,"Xenoraid is a very well made shmup. While the game is certainly not a bullet hell, the permanent death of starships can be a drain on money best used on upgrades. The enemies and bosses are interesting, with a variety of attacks, but in the late game, some larger enemies (the Destroyers) have somewhat cheap attacks that will almost always cause the end of one of your ships.The seven player ships themselves are also interesting, with a pair of attacks each and 3 upgrades, ranging from increased damage to types of forcefield. As well as upgrades to each type of fighter, you can buy larger upgrades.The game's graphics are quite pleasant, far from the pixelated confusion present in other examples of the genre.Overall, with the increased playtime available with a NG+ mode and wave survival mode, Xenoraid is an excellent buy for any fan of the shmup genre,"

Haven't tried hard or survival or co-op yet.tl;dr: Game is effing amazing, for sure worth the $10 or less.Very competently done shooting, with a couple little details  that really click with me.  For instance, the enemies don't just fly by you in formation, they often break off and circle around and try to hit you a couple times before flying offscreen.  It suggests dogfighting in a way that most other shooters don't at all.The upgrade system is well done as well.  A few upgrades are absolute no-brainers, but the majority are either situational or a matter of preference.  Upgrade progress is reset after each set of levels and each set has different starting ships, so you get to play around with slightly different options every so often.  Ships are also fairly balanced with each other, although a couple do fill similar roles.The main draw is the ability to switch between four different ships on the fly.  This serves three purposes.1) Dodging.  During the second or so it takes to switch ships, you can't be hit.  This allows you to avoid those frustrating shooter moments when you're backed into a corner by enemies and bullets and can't help but be hit.2) Preserving damaged ships.3) Picking the best ship for the situation.  This is the most interesting part.  Encounter a big powerful gunship?  Switch to the ship with the strong but slow-firing railgun.  Bunch of asteroids filling up the screen?  Switch to a smaller, more nimble ship.  And so on.Replayability seems high.  Enemies don't attack in a set order and vary considerably from level to level and set to set.  Each enemy is itself a fairly unique sort of threat, hence each combination of enemies requires a bit of strategy.  Once unlocked, any ship can be used on any set.  Hard mode is unlocked after completing the game on easy.I don't normally bother writing reviews, but this is an A+ indie shooter that definitely deserves it.  Maybe not the be-all-end-all of shooters, maybe not enough of a challenge for hardcore fans of the genre, but Xenoraid is the most fun that this casual shooter fan has had lately."

I very much like the way enemy ships react to player actions rather than just moving in scripted formations. Most alien ships have guns with a fixed arc of fire, and they actively maneuver to line up shots on you or to avoid colliding with asteroids. They even speed up and try to evade offscreen when you have them at a disadvantage! For a 2D game where you're contstantly moving in a single direction, Xenoraid really feels like a cinematic space dogfight.The way moving left and right shifts your aim was frustrating at first, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly."

I am now a casual gamer, following years of no-lifting CSGO. I now live with my girlfriend who didn't really play video games. I love video games and wish I could play more. We both have full time jobs and little time for fun. We have played this wonderful game for approximately 40 hours. Xenoraid is amazing.Shoutout to the devs too - the fixes will make the game more approachable to people like my girlfriend. I can only carry her so hard and now maybe we can get past the 2nd world on hard.Now I need to go write a review for towerfall, the only other game to have captivated us this much."
,Recommended,460220,29528715,Posted: 27 January,all,retrorocket1,"Not much to say really, I like it. :DWhile at first glance it is pretty much just a regular scrolling shooter this game actually introduces something unique to the genre which in general is hard to do.You play as up to four fighters selecting between them as you would weapons in a normal scrolling shooter. Each ship having access to two weapons. What makes this unique is that 1. if a ship is destroyed you no longer have access to those weapons. 2. You actually have the feeling that you aren't the lone ship going to take on an armada. you are an elite strike force with the goal to take down the alien capitol ship.I want to say a little more about the switching out mechanic. While at first glance this doesn't seem to change much to the standard genre this is good for a few reasons. 1. Each ship has individual experience which gives you cash on level up. This encourages you to try out all the weapons instead of picking a favorite and sticking to it. 2. Each ship has individual hp, this introduces a risk versus reward system. Do I want to risk my low hp ship which I am sure will level up in just a few more kills or do I want to use my high hp ship that is max leveled.Finally I want to mention that ship and weapon design. Each ship feels like a unique experience they all have weapons that generally don't seem to overlap and that goes for the enemies as well. I can identify each enemy and they each have diffent weapons that work well against them. And it isn't just a damage multiplier. Overall I'd give this game an 8/10TL:DR: It is a good game, unique ships and enemies, and ship changing system looks old but feels fresh. 8/10"

The game play feels pretty solid, although, the difficulty can vary sometimes.  I feel some of the boss fights could use minor tweaks, but other than that, it is a good game.I do like the concept of switching between fighters though.  That is a great concept.Pick up this game if you love vertical scrolling shooters."
76561197967148777,Recommended,460220,31761647,Posted: 14 May,all,Scoremonger,"I don't play that many SHMUPs but this one really hooked me. It's less crazy Cave bullet hell and more like an elegant ballet of destruction where planning, aiming, shooting and tactics matter (almost) as much as your twitch skill.There is a steady stream of new playable ships in the campaign, and each ship has unique weapons and upgrades. You unlock upgrades stage by stage for the ships in your squadron, and decide when to switch out one fighter for another in the heat of combat. It's a fun loop. The weapons have a very Crimsonland flavor, as you might expect - chain guns, shotguns, missiles, flamethrowers, etc., but they work really well in a space shooter.The ship controls feel good - they have a bit of ""sway"" and heaviness to them, but the enemies and bullets are all tuned around this so it feels right. The nose of the fighter also turns a bit towards the direction you're going, allowing you to shoot to the left and right as well as straight ahead which makes the combat more interesting. The sound design is also really good.The campaign is short (I got through it in just a few hours), but the levels are procedurally generated, so they play out somewhat differently every time. There's also a survival mode and higher difficulty levels, plus co-op, so I feel like I got my money's worth."
,Recommended,460220,33943007,Posted: 31 July,all,vitalik1700,"Nice little shoot'em up. I like the ability to swap ships during combat, which makes you impossible to hit for a second or two and allows you to dodge bullets - due to this you don't have to be absolutely precise in all your moves. Obviously, this makes a game a lot easier, so don't think that hardcore gamers would love it. But I am casual gamer so i do.Not much else to say, really. There is a lot of games like this and they are not very different."
76561197960277861,Not Recommended,460220,32407506,Posted: 14 June,all,[STA] Cheeto,"The Campaign on hard is just an RNG slogfest. Get a bad combo? Restart. Accidentally juke left, only to have all the mobs spawn on the right where they can shoot you, but you can't shoot them? restart. Accidentally eat a missile while planning your next step? Restart.The concepts and ideas in this game are relatively fun, but I have a hard time recommending it for anyone but hardcore schmup players.The ships are cool and unique (though 3 are far overpowered compared to the others), the upgrades border between interesting and critically necessary, and the ability to pick different ships is nice--except you can't afford to swap them out.If you've got spare money to burn, and love the genre, get this game. the graphics are above adequate for the genre, the game responds excellently (sucks knowing it's your fault you flew into a missile), and each enemy type requires a little strategy and coordination to overcome. Unfortunately the game is mired with bad RNG and too little time spent being 'overpowered' before forcing you to start from scratch (with no carryover) on the next chapter.Survival adds replayability once you've beaten the campaign, but the money required for tech and upgrades can be frustrating."
76561198045503284,Recommended,460220,29957526,Posted: 16 February,all,max.savenkov,"Nicely designed shoot-em-up. The idea of switching fighters is rare enough and well-used: different fighters are better suited to different enemies, and you really have to learn every craft's capabilities. Upgrades also play big role, and you have to think carefully what to buy. Though SOME upgrades seem less useful to me than others.The game is also good-looking.Some downsides: first, and the worst is the checkpoint system. If you lose a level, it forces you to replay all levels since the checkpoint. This would be a game-killer for me, but fortunately, if you Alt-F4 out of the game before it saves your loss, you can just replay the level you lost. Checkpoints are stupid and should not be used in modern games!Second, if your fighte gets destroyed in the battle, you have to buy another one, which is not cheap. The problem is, if you lose more than one in a single level, you'd better restart it, because the loss of fighters will make the next level almost impossible. And if you lose three, well, you might as well lose the whole level, unless it's the final boss. In effect, this just leads to more Alt-F4s. Not a good design.Third, the game is a bit too short if you only play on one difficulty level (but I find Hard difficulty is way too heart-pounding for my own good, so I don't think I would be finishing the game second time). There is also Survival mode, but it's only for competitive players, so I have nothing to say about it."

If you are a hardcore shmup players and found yourself bored af, buy it and abuse yourself with it.Pros:1. Epic music. The OST is really beautiful2. Entertaining on normal difficulty3. Somewhat challenging, on hard difficulty and late games of survivalCons:1. Way too many asterioids. They disturbed your engaging positions, but provided more randomness of gameplay. Problem is there are TOO MANY asteroids2. Some alien ships stay on the screen forever, and move to deadly angles that you cannot attack them while they can attack you. They provide so unpleasant gaming experience that you literally would hate them. And because of too many asteroids, sometimes you CANNOT engage and kill them when just spawn3. Massively frustrating survival mode.(1). It provides high replayability, but limited money and overly expensive yet fundamental upgrades easily torn your budget red, without giving your ships even decent armament.(2). Very randomly spawning boss ships single handedly kill you and reduce your chances to score more - the stupid part is it matters absolutely no skills, you just have to restart and expect easier spawns in survival mode for better scores.4. The upgrade prices and tech are very imbalanced in the game. Some upgrades for ships are too expensive, while some similarly expensive ones are far too useless. Weapon upgrades are so necessary that makes a ship unplayable if you dont buy them, but you have to go back and forth in between techs and better weapons...which result always turned out stupidly frustrating.To be honest I am gonna play this game more and keep killing myself in this stupid OCD fest. But I won't recommend to people because it is overwhelmingly frustrating."
