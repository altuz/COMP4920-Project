Spent more for it than I do for most games--in fact, cleaned out the rest of my available Summer Sale funds to get it because Hey! Horse racing game!Felt a little remorseful, like maybe I could have waited until it went on a better sale like I do with most stuff. Started it up to see if I'd even like it---maybe it would suck or I wouldn't like it THAT much and could get a refund.9 hours of playtime later--all in less than 24 hours, I might add--here I am, writing this review.Exciting? No, not really, but if you think managing things and betting on horse races and trying to build up to Something from Virtually Nothing by way of some good decision-making and a whole lot of luck, this is for you.This is going to be one of my go-to games, never uninstalled, for a long, long, time."
76561198023503032,Recommended,460230,30252875,Posted: 28 February,all,alwaysbuythebigmayo,"Starters Orders 6 is a great horse racing SIMULATION game. Don't expect the shiny visuals and arcade-style gameplay of the Gallop Racer series here. As others have stated, this is more or less the horse racing equivalent of the Football Manager series with lots of spreadsheet-style screens and menus... but if the thought of a realistic menu-based thoroughbred stable management simulator gets you even slightly moist, then you've found the right game.What you'll like:Breeding - Breeding your own horses in Starters Order 6 is as simple as selecting a stallion and mare from a long list of available candidates and telling them to GET IT ON. If you own both horses, it's free of charge, otherwise you'll have to pay a nominal fee based on the racing success of the stallion or mare that you select. Just like in real life, you never know what's gonna pop out later. You can breed as many or as few horses as you want in a racing season and provide all of them with new names when they become two year olds.Auctions - You can buy and sell horses in auctions. Wanna buy that unproven two year old for $100K? Trying to sell off that ten year old with the bucked shins? There's a market for everyone in this game.Stats - All horses have fractional and positional race charts with comments, odds, and on-demand race replays, career statistics, race history, top rating and earnings lists... and even a hall of fame for your best horses. There are seasonal awards given to the top jockey, top owner, and top horses in several categories as well.Racing - Select from over 100 jockeys with just-edited-enough names like P. Napravnik or A. Velasquez and give him or her the ride on your horse in a race. You can provide your jockey with basic instructions and auto-play the race, or take control yourself in a first person view. A good selection of the North American ABC tracks are represented, and most graded races are named as you'd expect (The Kentucky Derby, etc.). You can even ship your horses around and race in other countries - notable races from Dubai, Hong Kong, Australia, England and Japan are all here.Variability - Each horse has his or her own personality and traits. Some run better in the slop, some will fight like mad in the stretch, some will always find the trouble spots, some are more suited to a particular surface or track, some will just stand in the gate and never do anything. You never know what you're gonna get, but it always makes you want to play more, and more, and more...Custom Races - You can export your horses and configure custom races for them. Throw up to 40 of your favorites in a four mile event and see how many actually finish the race. Pit your distance horses against each other in an Iowa sprint for $10 million dollars. Anything goes...Modding - You can add your own custom races to a schedule (want the Pegasus Cup in there?), or create a custom track, etc. The SO6 forums are a great resource for modding guides, and it's not too tough once you get the hang of it.What might annoy you:Graphics - They're fairly simple for 2017, but they get the job done. Just don't expect anything too cutting edge here and you'll be fine. They remind me ofhorseracegame.comor the 3D race predictions on the NBC racing telecasts (if you've seen those)Race Commentary - It's a little strange at times - ""The leader is last!"" or ""The leader is the leader..."" OK... whatever.  Don't worry, you can shut it off if it bothers you.Money Management - It's important to manage your money (especially early in the game). You'll probably have to win a few bets or take out a few loans to stay afloat. As your stable grows and your horses start winning the money aspect will become less of a concern until you can almost forget about it completely.Breeding Prospects - The breeding system is great, and very easy to use. However, it would be even better if the computer owners' stallions and mares carried over to future seasons. Sometimes you'll find a top horse to breed to, only to find that he or she is removed from the game the following season, so remember to get as many offspring as you can, while you can.No Online Play - There's no built-in online play. Hopefully future Starters Orders games will make this a reality. I think there's leagues on the forums, but I've never used them.Final VerdictDon't buy Starters Orders 6 for the jockey mode. It won't justify the price and will leave you disappointed. If you like sports management sims (Football Manager, OOTP, etc) and have an interest in horse racing... you'll probably really enjoy it. It's challenging, rewarding, and very well-made. I bought it at $19.99 shortly after release. I'd still definitely recommend it at the current price of $34.99."

On those long nights sitting in the office in the foaling barn waiting for a mare to foal, I thoughly enjoy playing this game. It is a fun way to pass the time. I like playing the owner game because of the simplified bredding consept and trying to target specific distances with the offspring but I think I am more enetrtained by the trainer game and trying to make good with the horses that clients send to you and hoping that after an Open House, I can attract clients with better horses. It is very possible in the Owner game to have a stable full of super horses by the time your 3rd crop of foals hit the track but with the Trainer game, it can be difficult to draw in those Super horses to sweep the all important Grade 1 races to boost income so you can rise through the trainer standings. I have won almost all the big G1 races but after playing many seasons in both the trainer and owner games, one G1 still eludes me, the Melborne Cup. The aquisition of that 2 mile monster than can win that race just seems to evade me. I will win that race one day but until then, I will just keep playing."
76561198037515966,Recommended,460230,32033205,Posted: 28 May,all,donohue34,"I'm recommending Starters Orders because it's the best horse racing simulator on the market. I suspect the rest of the review will sound somewhat negative so it's important to bear that in mind. If you're looking for a ""Football Manager for horse racing,"" as Starters Orders is so often described, this is as close as you are going to get at the present moment.Indeed, in some ways this is a throwback to the text-only games of yore. The majority of the action takes place ensconced at the training center of your farm, preparing your horses for upcoming races, participating in auctions, selecting sires and dams for breeding, and so on. The only non-text based aspect of the game are the races themselves, which, unless you are playing in jockey mode (I never do), will only be a video for you to watch.None of that is necessarily a bad thing, bear in mind. The allure of a game like this isn't the action, exactly, although it can be surprisingly exciting watching one of your homebreds charge down the homestretch of a graded stakes race. Instead, the pleasure is in the puzzle of it all, piecing together the clues to outwit your fellow owners, identify undervalued bloodstock, chart campaigns for your runners, and so on. Much of that can be done in real life on pen and paper. So it is here as well.As with any uncanny valley situation, it's the deviations from the areas of the game that come closest to being realistic that are the most grating. Players are offered the option of starting in any of four geographic locations, but all of the games are heavily anglocentric. Race meets last a handful of days at most and pop up at random throughout the calendar. Only two tracks conduct meets on any given day. 12+ furlong races are common. Betting is done with a bookmaker. And then there are the peculiarities that can't be chalked up to Englishness. Claiming races are largely replaced by ""selling races"" in which the horses running are entered into an auction following the race, not a sale at a set price before the race. Two year old racing begins on January 1. Yearlings are not available for sale. Auctions take place every single day.The root of the problem may be that the game attempts to encompass *every* aspect of the sport. This would be daunting on any budget, but it's folly for a smaller developer. The betting and jockey portions of the game are weak (the latter is especially jarring, as even mobile games have progressed well past what Starters Orders displays). Overseas racing includes both the flats and the hunts. Every add-on like this creates its own complexities - and this for a game that can't manage a proper tutorial (or even elimination of typos from game text).Lest this all sound too negative, it's worth pointing out what Starters Orders does so well. The calculations that go into the racing seem, from afar, to be impressive; you can tell from watching a race when a horse is running outside of his comfort zone or was compromised by a difficult trip. The breeding engine feels similarly sophisticated. The racing itself is reasonably realistic, though nits can be picked. Several mods are readily available, though none quite solves the problems identified above.All in all, Starters Orders is a decent time sink. If you are a horse racing fan, you could do a whole lot worse. In fact, it's the closeness to being great that vexes. With a little focus, Starters Orders could indeed reach a status among horse racing fans like that held by Football Manager among footie fans. But there's still work to be done."
76561198051874641,Recommended,460230,24192163,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Lightingale,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this game. I like horses, and managerial/tycoon-like games. I know nothing about horse racing.At first, I was disappointed by the graphics and turned off by all the lingo and acronyms, and I had to google a lot of the horse racing terms in order to make sense of the game. There's no hand-holding or walkthrough here. With that out of the way, the game starts to get interesting. Essentially, this game is based on decision-making, weighing gains/risks, and money management.. and it's addicting.If you're looking for a horse racing simulator, you can choose to do that too, but you'll probably find it a bit repetitive, and would rather skip past that part to get results faster and continue to build up your horses over a campaign of races.For those that are confused with the lingo, the most important statistic is the horse's RTG (rating). In order to increase the chances of winning races, enter horses in races where they are closer to the top end of RTG. You can view the RTG of other contestants when you enter a race, and decide whether your horse is competitive. Handicap races are the easiest way to build this up. Buying young, cheap horses that had a bad first race or two, building some RTG and selling them is a great way to make profit and progress your stables early on.I got this game on sale for $30, which (to me) is a lot for a game that isn't pretty or flashy, and is really difficult to learn for someone who isn't familiar with horse racing. Once you get past the learning curve, it becomes a very engaging managerial/decision-making game that you'll get the itch to load up several times a day for juuuuuust another race or ten."

For instance the outdated overview screen can be confusing especially for someone that doesn't follow horse racing very closely. Neverthelless after a few seasons of playing you get what everything means and how important upgrading your barn, stables etc is.This game has it all, it really will keep you playing for a very long time and although it looks simple it is actually very challenging especially if you are like me and dont use or do any cheats or easy ways of making cash.worth it all! get the game."

If you like text based sim games you might find something enjoyable here, but honestly I didn't bother sticking around long enough to check that part out and I just refunded it because even at the sale price of $25 this game still wasn't worth it.

I consider Football Manager to be the gold standard of sports sim games and Starters Orders is pretty close to that standard. It's really deep and can be addicting once you get the hang of the mechanics of the game. For me, learning those mechanics on top of having to educate myself on the sport of horse racing was a bit of a chore, but worth it in the end.I'm by no means an expert, but have learned enough to build a solid stable with breeding facilities. If you want to create your own stable and have a career that spans hundreds of years (keeping track of your horse racing world stats), you can do that. If you want to control your races by being the jockey (VR supported), you can do that. If you just want to bet on races, you can do that. If you want to spend time breeding high potential horses and slowly export them into a supersave to start your horse racing career you can do that (it also tracks your breeding lineage which I think is pretty cool).Once you learn the basics of horse racing, race types, season scheduling and get a handle on all of the stats and pre-race considerations, you will be on your way to hundreds of hours of enjoyment. All of the data you need to build a successful horse racing dynasty is in-game. The manual is fairly detailed, but if you're new to horse racing, you will need to look at some other sources online.I've watched a fair amount of youtube videos but found GRaiders videos the most helpful because he was new to horse racing and this game- so while at times it was a little painful to watch, you'll find that many of the questions you have about the game unfold as he plays. Most of those questions are answered which gives you a nice foundation of knowlege to start with.I think that this game is well worth 30 bucks and am happy with my purchase."

I realise  jockey mode is not the main feature of the game but the appearance of the horse and jockey models are quite poor when playing this feature.My most desired feature would be to allow a player to be both a trainer-owner AND train for other owners in the same game mode - like occurs in real life.

The UI is awful, the tutorial - well the tutorial doesnt exist other than a few tool tips, when you book a jockey to ride your horse some random jockey will end up riding it instead, and when you make bets they don't always register correctly.You will spend your available time to refund the game's purchase just trying to work out how to get your horses into a race (the only reason I didn't was because I tried the demo first and hoped that the full game would fix what I considered to be disabled features), think you have bet a few thousand on the winner only to find the bet was placed on some other horse instead, and be outbid on all but the most useless nags at auction. It may be the only horse in the race as far as horse racing games goes but this is that three legged donkey you will wish you had bought a few beers rather than taking a punt on. The 'complexity' is an illusion created by the non intuitive interface, the core of the game will quickly seem very simplistic to those experienced with management games, and this would be a dubious buy even were it released as a budget title. To compare it with Football Manager as a management game is laughable so the Pocket Lint quote is just that - pocket lint. I can't comment on the VR aspect of 'jockey mode'.*edit* one other thing, the rrp of this game (direct from dev site) is less than it is sold here (£25 not £30) so the 25% off is actually closer to the standard 10% for new indie games and I find this to be very disingenuous.This game DOES get the award for most hilariously bad commentary, however, ""the leader is last""."
