,Not Recommended,460340,29109857,Posted: 8 January,all,Killer Rabbit,"It's not that the game is bad, but I guess I wanted more than what's there. The mechanic of having to swap two heroes to move was a novel idea and made for some tough choices at times. I liked the variety of heroes. I liked the look of the game. I didn't have any technical issues. There was some aspects of the game I would have appreciated more information, but it wasn't really a negative. However in the end, it just felt somewhat repetitive with not much in the way of a carrot to keep me going. I ended each game session because I wasn't interested in playing anymore."

Uninstalled on 3/3(hell) difficulty cuz was too lazy(and it was hard).**Play it if you liked the following games - Blackguards / Braveland.Gameplay:Brilliant TBS game I have to say.It's one of those games that makes you maintain concentration by trying tofigure the best strategy to take advantage of your heroes, target specific enemies & kill them.- You begin with 4 heroes but have the option to unlock the rest.- You basically have 10 same levels to beat, different enemies each time. Sounds easy right? Think not.As you progress you will find it harder to reach higher levels no matter how good you think you are.- You reach the end by constantly upgrading your heroes, buying helpful items & unlocking new skills.Enjoyment: (5/5) - Game keeps you busy and challenged at the same time.Repetetive: (2/5)Replayability (4/5) - 2 New difficulties (after the 1st playthrough) , New playthrough with different heroes / differentstrategy.Frustraiton (2/5) - Leveling progressBoredom (0/5)Overall Score: 8.5/10*Game Tips*I have created a guide for beginners or people who need a working strategy so you can take a look by clicking on the link below.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=905402146**Screenshots Section**You're more than welcome to also check my screenshots for this game [link below] to seewhat this game has to offer.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDMikeW2k14/screenshots/?appid=460340&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.*** Recommended On Sale.******* Recommended On Full Price."

76561198009614137,Recommended,460340,30236895,Posted: 28 February,all,Emilim,"So here are some comments on the game itself.I decided to write a review right after a few-hour session of playing the game Guards.The player will take control of four characters and go to battle.The game includes all necessary aspects of the genre, including quests, upgrade.You can pick whoever you want, set them the way you like depending on your personal preferences.The longer you play, the more you’re involved.Your own interest is growing minute after minute, so what’s waiting ahead?So, let’s get closer to these aspects.Controls are quite simple and easy-to-use; I guess, even the person with no experience will figure out how to play.In combat mode, everything is quite understandable as well.Gameplay there are too many positive aspects here that literally makes this game unique. The main thing is game’s battle system. You are able to set your party members as you like, learn necessary skills and increase level of characters’ abilities as needed.By the way, I was impressed by the recruitment system. There are variety of your party’s positioning options here.Graphics looks nice, models looks great.Music in the game is beautiful and unobtrusive.All sound effects are quality and successfully complies with actions.I recommend the game."

76561198344794364,Recommended,460340,30220227,Posted: 27 February,all,Exsistentia,"This is original turn-based battle system. The graphics and audio are just okay.You can have over eight heroes in your own personal squad, but in battle you can only take four of them along with you so you will need to choose wisely. Every hero has its own strengths and weaknesses.This game is perfect for those who want the addiction of a strategy game without the need to spend hours on a single game session.This is a fun game. ""Guards"" will still keep you coming back for more."

Music tracks are lovely.The Game Guards best what you can get at the moment in the strategy genre.In my view this very good game.Thank you for reading!"
76561198006260288,Recommended,460340,29454927,Posted: 23 January,all,brukirk,"A good strategy game with fairly simple basic rules hiding a lot of depth.The units seem fairly balanced, although I think you will find favourites. The judicious use of inventory items in the final levels is important.Only slight gripe is that because of the angled view on the battlefield, you need to be accurate with your mouse clicks - click on your unit's heads.The fact that I am on my second run through, is the highest recommendation I can give."

If you aren`t brainless graphic-fan ""I want graphic like in crysis, i need to see every single leaflet!"", if you want get from game good emotions, warm atmosphere, warming up for your mind and challenge for your strategic and tactical skills - Guards will help you to have good time. Highly recommend.Overall rating: 90/100In details:Game mechanic and gameplay:The game is one of the worthy representatives of the genre of puzzles. In first view you think: Hey, it`s easy! Final boss is weak like gretchin, slow-passing player get his steam achievment for copleting game on normal in 2-4 hours.But after this... Well it was named nightmare, and was named right. Enemies are tougher, get new abilities and you couldn`t win without serious brainwork. Yes, there are some random, and it influence on you runs, bringing another problems, and forcing you change your tactic and correct your heroes` improve plan every new stage.I think, that for this parts game definetly deserves 95/100Graphic and interface:Simple, pleasant graphic, which make your eyes happy. It is help you dive into game by being ideal bridge between player and this masterwork atmosphere.Interface is comfortable, intuitive simple. But from disadvantages - starting camp. It will be better, if it was something another than list of characters, but it is not so critical.Solid 90/100Sounds and musicSound in game was made great(exclude assasin hitsound for me), but music begins to pall after 7-8 runs. Yes, there is no enough variety in music, but nobody restrict you turn on your own and enjoy game with your favorite songs.85/100 for this part."
76561197984040110,Recommended,460340,26018864,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,The Mighty Georg,"I am finding guards a very enjoyable, simple, yet strategic, easy going turn based, light rpg game. It's a simple game where you have a choice of 8 heroes to pick 4 from to take on a 10 level dungeon, each bringing their own play style and abilities. Personally I enjoy these types of games so i am slightly biased but heres a list of things I wrote down while playing:+ Turn Based Combat+ Chess (ish, but only because of the combat grid)+ Upgrades+ Music+ Cute Graphics (and they get better as you advance)+ Mouse is all you need (no keyboard needed)+/- RNG:+ for random upgrades each level but- for advanced levels where enemies block / dodge but no idea why+/- Tutorial (its as basic as it goes, but there is one)- The targeting squares can overlap, easily causing misclick (the middle line, overlaps the top line far too much)- Language translation (to English) is pretty basic and many errors can be foundOverall I am really enjoying thisCost me: £5.458/10"

,Recommended,460340,33327920,Posted: 6 July,all,Vienticus Prime,This is basically a rogue-like tower defense game. It maintains a simple elegance while required a mild amount of in depth strategy. It's fun to do a quick run every now and then when you got a few minutes to kill.

You have to play through the campaign without dying but your levels and rewards carry with you. Except there are in-campaign skills that you upgrade per level which do not carry over. This is great because it adds to the complexity of the game.One thing I am wonder about is if it's possible to beat the campaign on the first run through. I have a feeling it isn't because of the difficulty. I certainly wasn't skilled enough to do it so.However, I would hope that is is possible for that added challenge down the road (repeat play throughs). For ten dollars I see myself playing this for hours.Perhaps the quick tutorial should tell the users that the in-campaign upgrades don't stick with the character after death."

Do you like round-based-games?If so, you will find this game very entertainng.For the battles: Three heroes defending three lines. You got four heroes. So one hero is always behind the frontline- to heal or to prepare for his/her special ability next turn. One hero have to swap position with another hero each turn. It is simple, but challenging.Played it for 3 1/2 hours straight and I looking forward to play more.As a strategy gamer, I found it always hard to find something to play in between- I found it here.I can recommend Guards. Thanks devs!"

76561198047193316,Recommended,460340,25019173,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,SG.WillyStrong,"I can describe this game as unusual one!At first glance, the game is seemed too casual. I dont like casual games. Yeah, rules of games are really simple. Swap heroes to make a turn. Swap again to make another turn. Repeat this actions to complete the level. The first impression is always a mistake.When I reached the third level, I was forced to think about the turns. Enemies are getting bigger! Begin to cast a bad spells! The game starts to deliver incredible pleasure! You must kill 5 monsters to complete the level. Every hero has less then 20hp. One wrong move and you ll lose. You begin to plan moves ahead. If you move Witcher to the central cell and kill Armored Wolf then Poison Beetle will kill Archer at the top cell. So you move Archer back and Knight comes forward and stuns all enemies. So you get no damage. After you move Archer forward and she uses Arrow Rain and kills this Poison bettle and other 2 enemies. There are three more moves and level is completed. You spend gold for extra hero upgrades. New level starts.I tried different lineups, until I found the one that allowed me to reach the final boss. Yeah, final battle is immpressive. You should try this.Its really awesome. Its really strategy game. I have so much fun thinking about next moves.If you like strategy games, Guards will bring you a lot of fun."

It is very unusual and it makes you think about a few moves forward, because with reckless attitude the battle will be lost.While the game interested me, this game mechanics would be very suitable for smartphones and tablets."
,Recommended,460340,30264821,Posted: 1 March,all,vittoria,"turn-based strategy adventure where you play by four heroes (however you can change them in process); ones are strong in close combat others give a distant strikes, so you need to think each move carefully like in chess, so that weaker ones do not receive damage, so that distant strike units stayed out of damage, and close fight units get in touch with enemy.great overall design, great lightweight graphics make the game pleasant looking and give the feel of a quality product, great game balance makes the game addictive - its neither too easy to win, nor too difficult, at least on starting levels.definitely recommend!"

Between the levels you can upgrade some abilities or stats if you have enough gold, as for me, to complete the game better to upgrade only on side, stats or abilities, this choice lies with you)what else, very good what you can reset your passive abilities and try new strategy with another one.. about graphic - doesn't hurt the eyes, so big thanks for that) anyway i recomend to play, this game have some minuses but have more pluses, and this game are not boring..."
