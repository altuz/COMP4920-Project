At this point, considering the pace of the game, it was an absolute ""no way"" for me to revisit the same 3 maps (and a half) to unlock the few spots I hadn't found and try a few different ""monologue branches"". So I was there, at the end of a very unclear conclusion cinematic, with quite a good idea of what was the story about or could have been about but absolutely no idea if there was more to it. No idea, and no courage to push further sadly.Also on the downside :- this kind of narrative game definitely requires voice acting these days. It's standard now and when you don't have some, it shows.- the level design of the three main maps is meeeeeeh. Who got the idea, it would be cool to have 3 or 4 consecutive jumps with ramps on one of them to access capsules ? The game suddenly becomes a very cheap and frustrating arcade game for no other obvious purpose than to become frustrating."

Gameplay is immersive enough to scare the **** out of you sometimes. Graphics mostly relies on post-processing, but who cares as long as it looks cool. The story might not be as fancy as I expected, but that's ok considering the game duration.tl;dr: totally recommended."
,Recommended,460640,23843326,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,aprotasenya,"Two main reasons to play this game (on lesser and bigger scale) are anomalies and replayability.Anomalies'gravitational effect is designed so amazingly, getting caught into one is both always unpleasant and very different based on their type. The orange ones gave me the most intense experiences: while I wiggled and tossed here and there (whimpering into my screen), trying to slide at least a little bit out of its gravitational field; while my maximum acceleration did not give me any significant motion; while the anomaly pulled me closer once in a while with its rough, unstoppable power, – that's when I had THE best experience of helplessness in games EVER.I try really hard to avoid the orange ones, I'm not afraid to zip at high speed near the green ones, but the blue ones? I'm freaking terrified of them! I've never encountered a single one, because I'm damn scared to get even close, so evil they look!Replayabilityhere is its own thing, seriously. Wherever you see a well-designed replayability you get something from dying/failing and trying again. But here you get a whole LOT of stuff inside your head: you memorize parts of the diary, reading them in a new way after some time; you start to understand the mechanics and laws of the game better; you memorize the areas a bit, so you get better at navigation. After some time you remember where you've seen lots of Gamma-minerals, and where you found the easier shortcut for a very risky way(see the ritual mountain on the Guild beach).This is also a pretty meditative game: the dynamics of the drone's movement always put me in a trance of sorts. The energy system adds to that.Magically, the game where a man has to act fast in the face of death, is about taking your time, and giving everything around a thought, and dying painfully and slowly to try just one more time despite the sun slowly rising outside your window."

The pros: great ambient music, it really helps setting the mood for the game.The artwork is good, UI layout and design is pretty, everything, minus a couple of weird exceptions in one of the map areas, seems to reinforce the overall atmosphere of the game. It's not particularly challenging, but it seems more of an exploration game. The story seems interesting. Overall, kudos.The cons: it's short, perhaps a bit too short. More map areas, and more tasks would be interesting.As it is you won't be able to shake off the feeling that it's just a short albeit pretty game.If you're into exoteric scifi though, you might like it. Try and get it on a steam sale."

Imagine that you are some kind of Robinson Crusoe in the future, and you have to survive by gathering resources and experimenting. The only shortcoming Breached has is that it is very short, it feels like it is a tech demo for a bigger game. So I wouldn't advice buying it for full price, wait when it is on sale. Then you certainly won't regret it."

Of course game needs some practice, especially in gameplay. But in other aspects (sound, graphics, narrative) this game is qualitative and interesting. For this small amount of time you will enjoy some lifeless land views, atmospheric soundtrack and strange story of Corus Valott.  And this is sci-fi game, you just can't refuse. Don't get augmented!"

I would really love to dive into the story, but with developers expecting players to make precise movements with no strafing and moving backwards it is just iritating. My guess is that it was meant for VR, thus movement simplification was applied."
,Recommended,460640,29287190,Posted: 15 January,all,Flashback,"While the game has certain shortcomings, it's a solid sci-fi experience and can be, without a doubt, recommended.Pros:+ immersive setting;+ nice graphics and interfaces;+ abandoned alien world that asks to be explored;+ interesting story idea with good pacing and tension;Cons:- drone controls (no strafe, seriously?);- the writing itself could be better, feels a bit amateurish and makes protagonist look like a drama queen (although, judging by developer's name, maybe it's intended =) );Some say that ""only 3 areas"" is another disadvantage, but I found it perfect for this short game (minor spoilers):- First time I failed surviving, not being familiar with game mechanics;- In my second playthrough, I scavenged required amount of resources out of just two maps, at which point 8 days have ended and that third area remained to be a mystery to me;- I had to restard again to explore the third level, as well as find all capsules and see what's inside. So, in my experience, 3 areas here is a right number.7.5/10"

And I played several versions between prototype and this release version. I need to admit that game making huge progress in visual, gameplay and narrative in each version. The most thing I love in this game is its uniqueness. It doesn't clone any known game or try to repeat well known experience. No, this game is unique and it maybe not comfortable at the beginning. I recommend to be sure that you have enough time for exploring Breached on the first launch. Don't try to come here for quick fun, please."

,Not Recommended,460640,33069934,Posted: 30 June,all,Lumps Plays,"So...it's a VEHICLE based game...that is essentially an excuse to make the controls really annoying to deal with. But at the REAL heart of it, it's a resource management game and you are collecting resources, that's all, and you're controlling ""drones"" for the whole game. So get ready for constantly getting stuck on everything, because that's the main mechanic of the game (not flying drones, driving ones). And it's sluggish intentionally, on top of that. The frame-of-view is insanely high (to emulate a ""vehicle"") and the controls are slow to respond.So the entire game is just filler to give you something to do while you explore the narrative. I can respect that, narratives themselves are rewarding, and this game has a PRETTY GOOD ONE as far as I'm concerned (I love me some sci-fi as long as it doesn't involve magic). But...is it a fun game?I don't think I can say so.WHAT THE GAME NEEDS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE: An actual vehicle. The high frame of view does not cut it. Combined with the repetitive goals (resources!) it kills the entire game including the interesting narrative.Honestly? A little shocked that someone made a vehicle based game without implementing an actual vehicle."
,Recommended,460640,23825975,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,The Continental,"It's an excellently written game with excellent visual design. But, as for game design, though Breached is simple, it's rough around the edges. All core mechanics are, mostly, excellent both in their elegant simplicity and execution. The interface and navigation, landscapes and relics of a long gone civilization, all the visual and, especially, sonic stuff is brilliant.Yet an essential part of it, the Fuel Synthesis process, relies completely on chance. One cannot solve the proportion of elements as a system of equations, so there's no way around trial and error. And this element of chance gives the game its 'challenge"" part, but it comes with great frustration. And a lot of replays. One minor failure can doom the playthrough. It's kinda realistic, but, man, devs, cut us some slack.A pretty, excellently written, simple game, Breached is as frustrating an experience as its bleak narrative implies. You're a lone, hopeless, broken survivor. This unforgiving game conveys that excellently."

,Not Recommended,460640,24347004,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,LIKEUCARE,"TL;DR: A cheap and frustrating arcade-ish game that doesn't offer much to the player besides collecting stuff spread around three maps in the whole game.Breached has its moments but to me, it just feels too much uninspired once you saw the three maps and collected the stuff to ""help you survive longer"".Basically, your goal is to use a drone and go around, scavenge items and artifacts so you can repair your faulty shelter. The thing is, the drone doesn't have good controls. Every time you are near an ""ANOMALY"" you can't escape it (like almost all the time) and that drone dies, with its collected stuff. Then you have two more tries for the ""day"" before your character is too tired and have to sleep, therefore advancing the game time and giving you a deadline to gather the needed resources. And the said resources to gather are mostly all near them anomalies... So you see the problem?Breached had potential. The images and the video on the Steam page seems convincing and it is a well-liked game.Maybe it is just not for me?PROS:+Great visuals.+3440 x 1440p and 21:9 support+Can cure insomnia!.CONS:-Uninspiring story.-Boring gameplay, especially for a ""walking simulator"" (more like a flying simulator here).-Weak controls over the drone.-No voice acting in this game.-Bland soundtrack (not worth the DLC purchase... UNLESS you have insomnia and require sleep? Good remedy here!).OVERALL:Disappointed on this game, my opinion! I might revisit this game at another time to give it a chance but that won't be anytime soon. Thankfully the game ain't pricey so give it a chance if it interests you... worst case, get refund!RECOMMENDATION:I can't recommend this game to anyone. You do have to love ""walking simulators"" in general while Breached do have some variation. Alas, the poor story, bland soundtrack and weak controls are the perfect recipe for a snore fest (unless it is what you seek!)."
,Recommended,460640,29509520,Posted: 26 January,all,Fib,"This is effectively a short narrative game in the style of Twine games, but with much higher production values. The drone sections would be better with a mini-map, but they contribute well to the atmosphere. I'd love to see a longer game based on the ideas of this one."
76561197981435949,Not Recommended,460640,29081632,Posted: 7 January,all,Sir Chiveshallot,Nice idea and story is intriguing. Unfortunately game play involves randomly hunting around for resources in a difficult to control drone.  I dislike searching games so I've stopped playing.
,Not Recommended,460640,24324763,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Axolotl,"After reading reviews and watching a couple of short let's plays I had high hopes for this game. The premise is really interesting and I thought could really do something.For such a small game, the graphics were impressive, the sound/music (though others have complained) were also fine. The controls took a little bit to get used to but were pretty easy to figure out. All in all it was a decent little demo.And that's all it was. It felt like an unfinished demo. You're dropped into a world that's not very well explained. I personally got frustrated at several points and had to push myself because of my initial curiosity of the game. The text logs were okay to read but once again the story felt like there should be so much there... like so very much more.There's definitely a nugget of greatness in there, but only if the game itself were expanded and developed. But sold as it is, I would not recommend anyone to buy it."
,Not Recommended,460640,29198488,Posted: 11 January,all,Kryyss,"Before I put anything here, I went and looked up a word. You may wonder why I felt the need to do that, well its because I wanted to absolutely sure that what I experienced while playing Breached was what I thought it was and what it meant. The word was 'sigh' and the definition was:verb (used without object)1. to let out one's breath audibly, as from sorrow, weariness, or relief.Now, it may seem odd that I had to look this up. But when you consider that I've never sighed while playing a game before I had to be certain that I understood this reaction in a new context. I've sighed at work. I've sighed while on a long plane journey but never during a game. Breached was just THAT dull that it ranks a first for me in my gaming experiences. Why was this? Well, let me dilute the essense of what Breached does into text. The fact that its possible to convert a game into a text equvilient itself reveals how shallow it is.I'm thinking of a number between 3 and 27 and it's made up of 3 seperate numbers. Now, you have to guess what the 3 numbers are... but each time you guess you have to give me a newspaper by walking to your nearest shop and you're only allowed to bring back a maximum of 3 each time. Oh, and you also have a fixed number of guesses before the game is over and I win. It's kind of like 20 questions, but without any clues. This...  is the 'gameplay' that Breached offers you.You may find that an insane premise for a game, but its true. The designer actually thinks its fun to have the player guess at a number. Of course, they claim that you're 'synthesizing fuel' but the fact is that you have 3 resources and you have to mix them in the exact ratio to win and you only have a fixed number of tries because you consume resources with each attempt and you have a limited amount of tries to gather them. The materials are available in the game world which consists of desert with metal debris and the amazingly creative remixed version - metal debris in a desert. Now deserts can be interesting if effort is put into their design, but what you have here is someone who has taken the same prefab structures and done a ton of copy/paste with a bit of rotatation thrown in for good measure. This is level design at it's most lazy.So now you know why I sighed. The core gameplay in Breached is just bad. It's hardly even entertainment let alone a game and as for being 'story driven' well.. I've seen more text and relevant content on the back of a cereal box."

Now, this was a somewhat interesting premise at first and I even found myself intrigued… for about the first 5 minutes. After that the lack of any meaningful story outside of a smattering of text logs grew exceptionally boring and the gameplay itself lacks any meaningful style or content. Offering no obstacles to overcome outside of the ticking timer that is the 8 days you have and the magnetic anomalies, the game has really nothing to offer except a pretty landscape. There aren’t even any meaningful puzzles outside figuring out the optimum mixture of minerals for your fuel.""Bland, boring, and lacking meaningful.... anything...
