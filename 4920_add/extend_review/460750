Other than that, it's still a very fun party game and shows a lot of promise in upcoming updates. Stay tuned!NEW UPDATE: 8/14/16Thank you so much for adding graphical settings now! The game can run much smoother on my laptop, for a more enjoyable experience. However, the game is still a bit lacking in features. I will update my review once a larger update releases. Still a great game!"

My left hand just got salty because my right hand is using catbot to pierce through my left hand's vanguard's shield so I was only able to type this review out with my right hand for my left hand is too busy trying to refund the game at the same time. send help."
,Recommended,460750,27901793,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,WaffleNinja,"Pros:Varied, interesting characters with unique abilities.Strategic counterplay (e.g.Torque'sdual-blades counterCatbot'sshield-piercing).Skins are not locked behind microtransactions (they are unlocked by playing the game).Maps involve a theme that enhances gameplay (e.g. scoring a goal onTURBO CLUBinRobominationawards a power up).Playing with friends (online) is extremely easy and takes very little time to set up.Gameplay is smooth and feels natural (mostly).Cons:Some characters feel extremely cheesey.Torqueis basically invincible when used by a competent player, andDropJaw'sshockwave will crush your hopes and dreams, along with your bot.RobominationandBlade Ballare great, but the game feels extremely lacking in mode variation.Playing online is a bit tricky - sometimes, players lag out and fall off the map without actually seeing it on their client. This effect can also lead to unexpected blade hits, even when players are nowhere near each other.The maps are excellent, (except forAI CORE, which is an absolute mystery to me) but there really aren't that many of them once you get down to it. The rotation becomes rather monotonous after an hour or two of play.Controls are NOT rebindable, even for keyboard.The game gives keyboard input prompts, even when you're using a controller (which the game recommends you use, by the way).Graphics settings are extremely minimal.Framerate is capped at 60 FPS.If you're looking for a great party game, or a way to have some fun with your internet friends, Blade Ballet is perfect for you. At $14.99, though, you're not getting all that much bang for your buck. I'd recommend buying this one on sale.7.5/10EDIT: Formatting."

It was easy to find a match, the community was buzzing and vibrant. Everything seemed to be going well for it.Fast forward a couple months and I ended up with:*Discord account*Discord app on my phone*A bunch of new friends on Steam that never play the game and that I never talk to*A game that nobody ever playsAnd thus, realizing how a good experience has ultimately gone bad... like so many other multiplayer games, it's possible for the game to just die. I found myself on the Discord server plenty of times, asking people if they wanted to play a match only to recoeve no reply... A discord server with quite a few people. If I just run the game and hope for the best, I will just time out looking for a match. I have given up.It's sad to me to do this because the developers are very active and they are constantly updating the game with new patches and content but sadly, aside from these events called ""Beat the devs and win a key!"" Nobody is ever playing it.RIP.It's a dead game. I really hope it doesn't close the studio because the developers are good people, the game itself is great. The fan-base has moved on to other games as novelty has worn off and the addition of cross-platform between pc and ps4 didn't help one bit because nobody is ever online.Thankfully the game can be played locally but with work, etc and new games coming out, I do not have the time for setting all that up. Not everyone has the time for that.TL/DR:It's a great multiplayer game that nobody is playing. This is why I prefer single player games. Sometimes even when the game is great, it doesn't have enough community to hold it up.Sometimes multiplayer games thrive like Dead By Daylight, Rocket League or Depth and sometimes they just become forgotten, overlooked or overshadowed."

76561198089275508,Recommended,460750,24838069,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,The Fallen Knight,Great game but there is no offline AI mode so if you're on your own then you can't do much because whenever i go into online no-one is there. EVER. If you have many people to play with it's AMAZING but otherwise wait for the game to get popular so there is a point to using online mode.
,Recommended,460750,28686409,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Twitch.tv/Ezman360,Very fun game with very quick rounds. I would reccomend this game at a discounted price. I bought 5 copies for friends and myself we enjoyed it.

,Not Recommended,460750,33851325,Posted: 28 July,all,Hardshot Dave,"I can't recommend this game, even on sale. It feels more like a minigame than a standalone title. The bots feel unbalanced, and there isn't a lot of fun to be had here unless perhaps you have three other people to play with. Even so, there isn't much replay value here. The soccer mode is kind of fun, but I found it altogether lackluster. I played this game once with my friend and then uninstalled it. You can watch our first reactions to the gamehere."

,Recommended,460750,25965103,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Bigosaur,"Cool game. I play mostly local co-op. It takes some time to master the mechanics, but once you do it's a lot of fun. I like the fact that one of the players can play on keyboard and it has proper keyboard controls unlike some other games. Good game for a quick 3-4 player clash."

,Recommended,460750,27351023,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,TrentonVan,"Overall fun game, I would reccoment using a controler for playing this game as it is not too easy to use a keyboard for these controls. Very unique, my only complaint is that the multiplayer is lackluster. But the BB Discord channel is great for that. Making a private lobby with your friends is fast and fun. I definately reccoment this to people who have a lot of free time, because it will eat it all up"
