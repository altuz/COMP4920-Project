76561198024616773,Recommended,460780,25505817,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,moop96,I happen to be a massive fan of these games. I have played almost every game that Spiderweb Software has produced.I was a bit dissapointed by Avadon: The Black Fortress at first but grew to enjoy the series. So far I love this new game. The controls and skills are imporved and more challenging with friendly fire added in.Well worth the buy!
76561197971874482,Recommended,460780,25505425,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,Toren_S [Also Friendly],"Leaving the original review unaltered below, adding some updated thoughts now that I've had time to play it more...  The story and dialogue is still as excellent as I remember in past games, so I'm just going to talk about the mechanics / battles.Vogel always iterates his system every game, and now that I've had a chance to actually get into some of the battles I'll list a few things I'm enjoying as improvements or haven't managed to update from previous Avadon titles:+ Mana is no longer something that you just chink away at slowly and occasionally forces you to go touch a healing pylon.  Instead your mana is an actual resource in fights that returns fairly immediately after fights.  I enjoy this more from a tactical perspective, he's learned a lot that many gamers don't enjoy the survival / bar management style of things and is focusing on immediate battle stuff.+ Hard mode adds friendly fire.  I'm not sure if it also adds friendly fire to the enemies or they have it naturally, but this is a good addition to making hard mode more difficult and strategic without the 'raw numbers' problem that's occasionally plagued his earlier games.+ Taunting actually seems to work right on Blademasters finally.= Graphics are largely unchanged.  This doesn't bother me, but don't look for graphical powerhouse here.  Still, for a retro-style game I think everything looks fairly polished.- Shops are still as worthless as they have been in every game.  Money is still extremely useful to buy permanent boosts or extremely potent items that are scattered towards the endgame, but spending any money in the basic shops is just a trap that will penalize you later on.Stil an overall very strong buy for any fans of turn based tactical combat, strong storylines, and choices with non-immediate effects that matter.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --I haven't had time to fully get into this game, so this is just a preliminary review.If you haven't played any of Spiderweb Software's Avadon games before:  The brief rundown is that you're going to create a noob character of one of five available classes and pick up controllable NPCs of each of the five other available classes with their own personalities / stories.  You still retain full control over the leveling / skill ups of the NPCs.Battles can be done in four difficulty levels, I'm trudging through on Hard with what I feel is an appropriate level of difficulty.  You can change at any time, preventing a difficulty spike from making you want to rage at the game unable to progress.  Combat's turn based and very tactical, with most standard fights keeping to predictable mechanics and spells equivalent to what your party members have, and boss fights often like puzzles.Vogel's writing has been honed fairly well over the years, it's often wryly humorous.  If you don't enjoy reading a lot, you might want to stay away, a large joy in the Avadon games is in the extensive plot and your personal reactions to the plights of the people in the gameworld.  That said, I still think there's a lot to get out of purely the tactical combat if that's your cup of tea.Having played all his games and the prior Avadon ones, I see some streamlining of things from the prior games but most of it is recognizable.  If you like small group tactical RPG action and a strong emphasis on story, his Avadon games are a good series to start with.  They're not as deeply customizable as the recent Avernum remakes, which can be both good and bad.  It's almost impossible to screw up your characters in Avadon, but there's only so much different you can do with them as well.I'll try to edit this with further thoughts when I can play more, but my first hourish with the game is making me look forward to what's going to start happening."

76561198004173499,Not Recommended,460780,31777156,Posted: 15 May,all,Taear,"I enjoy huge RPGs. I want to see loads of dialogue and exposition from characters around me. I like picking a class and building it in massive skilltrees. And the Ultima games are some of my favourites.And yet Avadon falls totally flat for me. I'm finding it hard to put into words why, it's more of a build up of lots of little things.Some of it is how utterly static the backgrounds are. There's things lying on the floor but you don't interact with them. You just press your inventory and they show up in an area called ""on the ground"". Chests and barrels are occasionally available for you to open and you can touch those, but that's it.When you equip items they don't show up at all on your character either. Not even on their paperdoll.There's huge amounts of totally useless items too. Mops. Weights. Bones. Limbs! I understand that they're there to add character to the world but when everything else is so static it doesn't ""fit"".The dialogue trees are extremely annoying as well. I don't feel like I have choice. To find out about a quest I often have to ask everything available even if it doesn't feel like something I'd want my character to say. If I say the wrong thing there's times i've had to repeat the ENTIRE dialogue again until I get back to the point I was at.This isn't for specific story stuff either, just random normal quests. A quest where a character wants me to find a gift for his betrothed and because I asked a question at the end of the dialogue I had to re-do the whole thing to get the quest.And a big thing for me - if you've already done a quest you can't say that during the picking up of the quest. If I've cleared the quarry you're asking me to clear I cannot say ""I did that already!"". I have to finish the dialogue and then speak to the person again.This often meant getting the quest, going to where it said and realising that I'd already done it a few hours ago. That's extremely frustrating for me.It also autosaves extremely rarely. It's my own fault for not saving, but it's still quite annoying."

The ending (at least my ending) was reasonably satisfying, and I was impressed how the little things you achieve (or bungle) along the way are smartly picked up in the epilogue.However, I was a bit disappointed from the map design and the battles, as someone who has played all the Spiderweb games. Avernum simply had the more interesting setting, and Geneforge the more interesting story line.Still, I enjoyed my time in Avadon, but I don't think I want to be back there anytime soon."

,Recommended,460780,25799263,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Seph,"A decent conclusion to a very interesting series. For anyone who already played any of these dev's games, it'll feel very familiar yet again. The writing makes the simple-looking game world come alive fantastically, each situation acquiring depth that wouldn't be possible in typical triple A fashion. The simplicity of the graphics makes them more of a template through which the real depth of the games can show through. The RPGs from Spiderweb all have that quality.Combat is fun and strategic, in typical turn-based fashion, with grid movement. It's nice how it seamlessly transitions from exploration to fighting. It offers a good amount of different classes, and different builds for those classes.As for some feedback on the story,I thought it was rather weak how we were promised a big conflict at the end of Avadon 2, but Avadon 3 is mostly smooth sailing. You end the war with great ease, and the game is mostly about dealing with the iconic Redbeard and his growing insanity, yet again. I was a tad disappointed by that. Even more so considering we had the option to kill him in the 2 previous games, and that choice wasn't respected in either of those times, with canon following on as if he lived in both occasions."

76561197994613061,Recommended,460780,31683490,Posted: 11 May,all,blackmoondev,"For a cRPG fan - this game is a nice, solid portion of fun.At first I thought that the visuals could be a bit better - but after few initial hours I totally didn't mind that.The story is good (nothing too fancy or philosophical, but it's deep enough that you want to uncover more of it).Turn-based fights require some amount of tactics (especially at first).btw. Avadon 3 was the first game of the series I've played and I totally got the story and everything - so you don't really need to play the previous games to have fun with this one.Overall - if you like hardcore RPGs - play this:)"
,Recommended,460780,25648971,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,Parris,"It's likely that anyone reading reviews for Avadon 3 has likely played the first two, and perhaps some other games by Spiderware Software too. ""More of the same"" is an accurate description, since there haven't been any huge changes to the game, and it's a continuation of the story that began and progressed in the first and second games. This time round, Avadon finds itself in the awkward situation of having two keepers, as well as fighting a prolonged, fractured war on several different fronts from enemies both within and without the Pact. You're a young Hand who's been dropped into the middle of this confusing situation and - as with any other Spiderweb game - you're supposed to navigate through the events of the game via combat and intrigue while deciding which of several imperfect factions deserves your support the most.The UI is mostly the same, with a few cosmetic changes here and there (nothing that'll confuse anyone who's played the first two games). The mechanics feel very similar too. The only major changed I noticed was that you now recover all mana after a fight, instead of some of it (in my opinion it makes the game easier, seeing as now no longer have to ""hold back"" your most powerful spells, since all your spell energy will recover after a fight anyway, except for a tiny slither in the event that you get knocked unconscious). The skill trees have been changed slightly, but it's nothing too major. There's some new spells for mages, although I feel like one AoE one in particular is a little OP.Although I get the impression I'm only about a quarter of the way into the game, I can already feel my loyalties being tugged in at least three different directions. In between trying to end both a civil and a foreign war, there are plenty of opportunities to make money,♥♥♥♥♥♥people off and gather potted plants for your lovelorn enemies. There are several new companions to get to know, along with some returning faces, and following in the style of the previous games, they all seem to have their own niggling problems that they'll pester you with.Overall, I've enjoyed it, but that's not too surprising considering that I also enjoyed the first two games.List of cons I've found so far:- Usual Spiderweb problem of minimal sound and perhaps too few sprites for the game.- Suffers from lack of proof-reading (at least 7 or 8 spelling mistakes that I've found so far, along with a bit of strange grammar at times)- Khalida"

It's a Spiderweb Software game, and that means it does not differ much from all the other Spiderweb Software games. If you love them, you will love Avadon 3 as I did, if you don't - well, this game won't make you.For those who didn't yet play any Spiderweb games - start with another one, Avadon: The Black Fortress, for example, because it's btter to have the whole story before seeing the ending.I think Avadon 3 is slightly easier than previous titles in series (and much easier than old Spiderweb games), but it's still interesting enough for me even on Normal level. Also, this time, I often failed to find a choice in dialogs I want to chose. But in the end, everything was satisfactory."

Their storytelling and the rich lore of every game world (Avernum, Lynaeas, etc) is fantastic. I've clocked up over 30 hours and haven't even finished yet. Whilst the graphics and lack of music might put some people off, and the style of game might not be for everyone, I can't recommend this game enough."
,Recommended,460780,30499120,Posted: 13 March,all,blizzardmetal,"Many, many years and probably about 20 games later, Vogel releases his finest game to date. A lot of people who look at Spiderweb's titles as being the same over and over again most likely haven't played enough of them to see the subtle differences. There are a couple things that set Avadon 3: The Warborn apart from previous titles. One, it's slightly more accessible than previous entries. The character leveling and skill trees aren't quite as involved. This may offend some of the most hardcore RPG fanatics, but may help newer players get into the characters a bit more without feeling overwhelmed. Also, while still being a fairly open game, progression feels a bit more pointed, and less ""all over the place"" like the earlier Avernum games. I can appreciate both of Vogel's styles completely, the mass chaos of the Avernum sytling and the simplified, slightly more streamlined Avadon entries. Without ruining the story, I'd say by the end I'm completely satisfied with the way Vogel ended the Avadon series. Lots of twists and turns, and plenty of choice and consequence, and certainly multiple endings, depending on how you handle certain events. The game took a bit less time to complete than Avadon 2: The Corruption, and that's okay. Finishing it never felt like a chore, and makes me look forward to playing whatever he comes up with next. Highly recommended to older gamers and younger players who prefer substance over flash."

The itemization is on point so far (about 15 hours in atm) where there are periodic upgrades but not so often that you feel like you're swimming in loot.

The Hands reminded me of the Inquisition whose sole job was to actually shut people up about the Secret Knowlege that the Church wanted no one to know about and keep the vassel states under it's control.and the Stone Code Sharia La which is a Bane on the World!!   We must do this it's the law it's written on stone(morons)So we have the ending of Avadon.  Was it good?  Yes it was Good man it was Great To make Red Beard Suffer!I just think he should have suffered more and The Dukes Story should have been fleshed out a lot better.We do get to have the Traitors full story fleshed out which was fantastic!   And I loved that she got her revenge.But that revenge should have eaten at a certain someone more.  The Corruption story part was done reallly well.The game has the same Battle Mechanics but there poorer now then Avadon 2.  The developer doesn't understand thatnot every enemy should have tons of health and be hard to kill.   There should be early on a way to kill one enemy with one skill.  A Game that did good job of this was Dragon Age Orgins(Battles redone Mod)  Way better balancing.The story flowed really well and you once again could behind Red Beard's back try to make his life living hell!I chose through out this series to go my own way.  I tried to be the good guy and fix things between both groups.Sometimes playing off of them.Would have liked Havar Council to be more involved in this series.  Over all...It was fantastic Series!It just needs better battle set up.   More Skills, more Spells.

Like both previous versions, it relies far too much on unnecessarily lengthy, boring NPC dialog, and has outdated graphics, tons of junk items that serve no purpose.As before it also involves loads of walking back and forth between doing a mission and reporting to the NPC that gave you the mission just to get mission part++. Why didn't you just tell me the whole thing straight away and save me a few trips? Nobody knows. Redbeard is mysteriously alive and back yet again, even though you probably killed him in version 1 and again in 2. Dude must be a cat.If you've played one Avadon, you've played them all. There is genuinely not a single new thing in this rehash. It is, however, a decent way to mindlessly kill some time.

I've been playing Jeff Vogel's games since the original Exile: Escape from the Pit was released as shareware.The graphics and sound are old-school and unimpressive by modern standards. The exploration and combat are fun, but get a bit grindy in a few spots. The challenge of this game is not in winning it, but in deciding how you want to win it. You will help heroes with glaring moral flaws and fight villains with legitimate grievances, and no one is going to hold your hand and tell you which are which.

The option in classes and a wide array of abilities helps keep the encounters engaging and allows light tactical planning on medium-to-large scale battles (especially on higher difficulty levels).Following the well-established molds of the Geneforge and Avadon sagas, Avadon offers a huge world and interesting characters to populate it. This game’s particularity comes in the form of a more focused storytelling that takes precedence over the free-form exploration. The story itself revolves around the player as a lowly Pact soldier that gets elevated to the status of Hand of Avadon, being given the power and the responsibility to end the war with the Farlands. How this is brought about is up to you: crush your enemies mercilessly, or subdue them by aiding in your common struggles. The sum of your positioning towards your superiors and companions determines  later-game outcomes.Between all the aspects that come out upon hours of gameplay, some excel.Things A3 got right:The “low budget GoT” feel of the story, having a gray-scaled political struggle at the center of your narrative, is well-paced and gripping;The retooled Vitality system and Talent upgrade paths shake up the fighting and leveling in relation to the previous iterations;The returning companions and npc’s from A1&2, as well as the cleverly written (if a bit on the short side) party interaction.Things A3 didn’t get right:The world could be more flushed out. The lack of bartering, interaction with less important npcs and a comprehensive font of knowledge (outside the painfully short codex descriptions) about the culture and political behavior of each country and people leaves too much to the imagination;Few minor dialogue inconsistencies (companions referring to early quests half-way through the game);The extended encounters (enemies with too much health and not enough damage output can easily become a slog rather than a challenge);The lack of a soundtrack, slightly offset by the mild ambient sounds.Avadon 3 is a great game. Small things, like choosing which companions will be by your side, learning their backstories, ideals and motivations and coming to expect their input in a given situation is one of the highlights of the experience. Likewise, defeating hordes and bosses and tracking down your antagonist step by step gives a real sense of progression to your campaign of liberation. The fact that story events are the direct outcome of the previous games’ plots should be enough incentive to get through the previous games first, even though it’s not strictly necessary. All around, the positives of the game far outweigh the weak spot that are almost inherent to this type of indie, like graphics and sound (On regards to which, by the way, you can always improve your experience by having your favorite dungeon synth/dark ambient playlist at hand, it makes the wandering around far more enjoyable).TL;DRSpoderweb quality right there. If you prize story over graphics, but think choose-your-own-adventure books don't have enough gameplay, this game is for you."
,Recommended,460780,34895174,Posted: 11 September,all,Allon the Cookie Dragon,"Like all of the Avadon series this game is about the story and story it has. It's telling the story of a land and it's people and you can be an influence in it too. What you do really affects and makes a difference.Are you a fan of stories that are a bit more about the ""Gray area"" of morality? Then Avadon is a story you might want to engage in!This is the third in the series and I do HIGHLY reccomend you've played through 1 and 2 (Or at least most of them) else a lot of what is done in this will feel a little odd. While the game can stand alone without knowing the history I've found having played the previous two it definitely helps.Very good combat strategy required and the slight changes they've made to how mana and health are both regenerated and treated in combat are improvements over the previous. Definitely this has been one of my favorites in the series so far! I do love the character of Red Beard and it's hard to say is he the good guy or the bad guy? You can be the judge of it... who REALLY is the bad guy in all this? That's up to you to decide because in the end it's just what you believe..."
