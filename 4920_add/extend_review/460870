,Recommended,460870,32156731,Posted: 3 June,all,Mechakitty,"God Eater Burst ResurrectionOpening case:Once I tired of searching for Monster hunter on PC, that is, Trying to look for english patches on Monster Hunter Online and searching for similar games like Tolkien(First one), which I didn't buy for the reviews I read; Few months later the GE bundle comes out, the first and second game with all DLCs and some new features was added to steam for a harsh price, and so I waited for a nice discount and it wasn't long until it got 50% off, I bought the game and I knew what I was getting into, a fun coop game with a lot of big monster fights and a lot more of grinding for parts and items to upgrade your equipment.Gameplay and CombatThe game is divided into 2 parts, there is the HUB, where you'll talk to NPCs and access your terminal to check status and customize mostly equipment and character, and field battles where you and your friends(or NPCs if you have none) will work together to defeat monsters(Arigami), which at first are small and easy and soon enough will get 20 times your size and easily kill you with 2 or 3 blows, most of them are reused with color swaps and a few model changes but it doesn't really bothered me as much as I'd think, they still have different move sets and parts to break, oh, yeah, large aragamies have different parts you can break with different kind of weapons, there are 3 types of damage: Crush, Pierce and Slash, besides elemental damage, they each are used to easily break aragami parts which physically change arigami, making them take more damage, enraged or even entering a second form.Graphics and Level DesignThe game was first made for the PSP and this is only a remaster, so not much has changed besides models and textures, character animations are still simple and they don't convey many emotions, the game still looks great for an anime game, level design is really simple as well, with around 5 or 6 different stages those become repetitive really quickly, but mixing with which enemies you fight in each stage make it so it doesn't feel unbearable, the stages are also well presented and designed, with a lot of space to run around and gank different aragamiesSound design and MusicVoice acting is really well made even though the writers were 13 years old and only one of them had a nice ideaRen's Arc, dialog really shines during mission, with interactions between NPCs, music is really forgettable and repetitive, you'll probably want to get your own track to go with the game"

,Recommended,460870,33493055,Posted: 12 July,all,Plophop,"Here are a couple disclaimers before the review proper:This is for both games in the package and the series in general.Both of these games have Denuvo. I will not talk about this, but other reviews do and you can research it yourself.I have spent hundreds of hours on this series on the PSP.This review is loooooooong.That in mind, let us begin.BackgroundGod Eater Resurrection and God Eater 2: Rage Burst are the re-remake and remake respectively of the two mainline games in the God Eater series.Both are set in a post-apocalyptic world where anomalous creatures known as ""aragami"" ravage the world and humanity is driven to compact settlements, most of which are run by an organization known as Fenrir. The eponymous God Eaters are recruited and trained by Fenrir to fight off the aragami threat.StoryThe protagonist of each game is a different person and go through their own events as God Eaters in different postings and teams, but they are both customizable in appearance by the player.The actual plot and writing is fairly typical corny anime, but nothing astoundingly bad. The main cast do get their fair share of development, but they are mostly forgettable and everyone else is one-note. Also, the story is linear which will bother some who want control of both their characters looksandactions.I do have to say, though: I liked the setting and the idea of biotechnology present, but it gets absolutely destroyed by gratuitous handwaving and ~anime magic~ in the later stories of either game.VisualsThese games were ported from the PS Vita and are stylized in a sort of 3d anime way. For me, those things mean that nothing much should be expected in terms of graphics.Which, honestly, is fine with me. The game runs steady 60 on my mid-tier rig and doesn't look entirely awful for what it is. If you wanted something more detailed, then look elsewhere.Same applies to animation. Mostly notable in the cutscenes.AudioThis release is only voiced in english dub for both games.You may leave now if you wish.Honestly though, I hate the job they did with the dub. It's part of why I play the games muted 90% of the time. If it doesn't bother you, then cool, but I despise that my jitome protag has no stoic voice to match the blank face; I suspect the Japanese VAs have just the voice, though.Bamco, it wouldn't kill you to put dual-audio in a PC release; it's not like there's even lip synching in the animations that you need to worry about, Christ.The sound effects are okay and the music is alright. A little weird in some tracks, but it gets the job done.Now, I know that most of what I have said so far ranges from lukewarm to outright critical. Some fans might disagree with me and they're free to do so, but these aspects are not why I've spent as much time as I have on the whole series.If you've stuck with me so far through the gristle, then you're looking for the same kind of meat that I am, and that is......the gameplay!Be warned for the uninitiated: GE is very grindy. Maybe me and all the other fans of this series and series like it are masochists. Whatever.The gameplay proper is fast-paced hack & slash, relying on both reflexes and knowledge to get an edge. On the surface, there are a decent selection of weapon types, aragami and maps to keep you challenged.While that in of itself can get stale in a while, it's backed by an incredibly vast array of customizable options and upgrades. These help shape your playstyle and it's fun to mix and match to see what works.You want to play as bioweaponized Guts with a giant ♥♥♥♥ off sword or roleplay as a beyblade through the power of the boost hammer? Maybe rain hell from above with bullets and explosions? Healer? Sniper? Just some crazy guy with anime cancer powers and a chainsaw going HAM so much that it would make Alex Mercer soil himself? Those and all in between are possible in GE.All the while, you get to look as neat/cute/lewd/edgy/absurd/unremarkable as you want with all the outfit options.While it would be great to show off to your friends and internet strangers, the ports arecurrently incapable of online play.I personally recommend holding off purchase if this is very important to you, because a fix seems to only be in the horizon.In closing:The God Eater series is equal parts flashy, crazy and fun for people who want something like Monster Hunter but with relatively less setup tedium and more action. As a game, it has potentiall to become so much more if the core gameplay and the general presentation is improved upon. But for right now, it's a good ol' hack & slash.For someone who wants a good overall experience, pass on this. For people who really want to get into the series, go for the PSP/Vita releases if you can. For those who seek anime tiddies......stop browsing Steam for that.TL;DR:This game is grindy and anime as heck but is rewarding for those who have the patience. Online co-op is broken for now though. If you're on the fence, consider it on a sale.Franis best grill."

(Some parts are kinda cringey for non-anime enthusiast and anime enthusiast alike)Nice port but there are still some bugs here and there but not really a hindrance to gameplay if you come by them. (Still fix them please.)Only problem is that no japanese dub option, but the english dub is not bad either so good job on the dubs.Score: 8.5/109.5/10 if the bugs are fixed"

But this game is unique, unlike the MH games this one has a story, and it is pretty interesting. Though the graphics are a little dated it is still fun. I would recommend playing this on a controller.

76561198336071645,Recommended,460870,32020728,Posted: 28 May,all,SSJGinger,"God Eater is my favorite video game series. Resurrection is an awesome game for the most part. What are my pros?1. Almost everything.What are my cons?1. The music during post-mission hangouts is WAY TOO FREAKING LOUD and the same goes for Rage Burst.2. The music during Sakaki's Aragami Class cutscenes is very very bad.3. Heavy handed drama at times. I'm thinking of the vulnerability scene where you hear Alisa crying out about her mommy and daddy while she's most likely strapped down in the infirmary. But there are other moments with other characters too. I get that people have feelings and some people have issues but the Alisa stuff is very dramatic and it goes on for a while since you get roped into a series of personal missions with her. Nana's personal stuff was done WAY better.4. You can't make your own choices. I spend a lot of time doing whatever Dr. Sakaki wants me to do and I can't reject his whims without stopping Story mode. So it looks like my character has made the choice to ally herself with Dr. Sakaki and his group. It also looks like my character is actively helping to hide Shio. Those are two huge choices! Clearly it would be better to give players the choice of allying themselves with Dr. Sakaki or Director Shicksal and then whoever you choose is the person whose missions you take. Later in the game a situation started by Director Shicksal gives you the chance to make a huge choice. Wait, forget huge, this choice is EPIC. But the game doesn't let you choose either way! With such a major decision and with the characters themselves saying you have to choose, with some of the characters for it and some of the characters against it, obviously we should have been given different response options and multiple endings so we could follow our hearts (or common sense in mine and Karel's case). Branching storylines and dialogue trees are some of my favorite things in games but my personal feelings aside, the situation in Resurrection was a huge opportunity to have epic multiple endings but they missed it and that is a huge con for me.So there you have SSJGinger's very first Steam review. Like all things, Resurrection has some cons but overall I really enjoy this game and I'm happy that I have it."
76561198024218344,Recommended,460870,33414533,Posted: 9 July,all,Gaming Raz,"Monsters In AnimeBetween the cool, sexed-up character designs, post-apocalyptic style, and J-pop inflected action, God Eater Resurrection is pretty cool. Althought Nier: Automata game mechanics put this game to shame.Better than Monster Hunter?While it's no Monster Hunter. The narrative-driven action was actually something that God Eater Resurrection took a shot at MH with some success. The plot involves a world in the not-so-distant future being overrun by massive entities known as Arigami, which are consuming everything on the planet to the point where humanity is on the brink of extinction. A resistance has been set up in the form of God Eaters, which are people who wield God Arcs as the only means of damaging and ultimately defeating the Arigami.Don't die. If your number is up, get out and if you're lucky, catch the enemy off gaurd and blast it!Final VerdictGod Eater: Resurrection is not perfect in any sense; What's more, it's not the title that breaks the mold of Monster Hunter. But it's still a fun game and is recommended. If you're in to this kinda thing."

I personally rather God Eater to Monster Hunter for its Anime-like style, missions, huge rosters of npc's who you can actually take into battle with you, tons of weapons and guns to craft and choose from. The game can be a bit repetitive at times when it comes to maps and hunting the same monster multiple times, but the gameplay itself is what makes up for it. Not only that but this game also comes at an amazing price to be able to get not only part 1 but part 2 as well as all of the additional dlc. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of Monster Hunter, as after playing, this may very well be your next addiction ♪Overall I give this game a 9/10"

It's one of those games that blows its load early and there's nothing new to hook you in outside of the story, which is mediocre at best.  Would work better on a hand-held (where it came from) where you can put it down and forget about it until you took a trip and had 2 hours to kill in a car.  On a PC there's too much temptation to plow through it as fast as you can, which just gets boring doing the same thing over and over."

Though if she didn't I wouldn't of found out about this game. I love God Eater and want more titles. The recent anime was also pretty good. Enough about that, time for my thoughts.NutshellGood A.I.Lots of character customise options and upgrades for your gearGraphics are impressiveMusic is goodCombat is simpleStory is good.ConsGameplay is a little repetativestory is slow at the start.Only an English dub is here. (IMO I enjoyed the English)A few more Aragami types would be nice.(Resurrection)The story of God Eater Resurrection is the same story from the PSP version. This time however there is an extra story added after the credit. There are two credit crawls before the story actually ends. And graphically the game is very impessive. You play as a new type God Eater of the Far East Branch of Fenrir, (new types are not locked to a specific weapon like old types) tasked to hunt down and ""eat"" these creatures of various sizes called ""Aragami"" that eat everything else.When you first start the game, you then customise your character. Things you can choose are voices, hair, and eye colour, faces, expressions, and wearing glasses, hair pins, etc. There is an option to look like Lenka Utsugi from the anime. There are no boob or butt sliders if you want fanservice, though there is some outfits that you can unlock through the story that should make up for that.There are many types of Weapons, Guns and Shields that you can use to slay Aragami. Such as Knives, Long Swords, Buster Swords, Snipers, Machine guns, Cannons, Small Shields, Medium sized Shields, and Large Shields plus some newly added weapon types from God Eater 2. Spears, Hammers, and Scythes. Each are different from each other. You can switch between Sword and Gun mode in the middle of a mission with a single button press. Handy against Aragami that have different weaknesses.Combat is pretty simple you have two melee attacks, a block and two Bullet Buttons. Speaking of Bullets you can create your own Bullets with different effects, and potency. You could make bullets that shoot lightning and frost at the same time. Or Attach a Bomb to that Bullet. It does take some time to figure out, thankfully there are recipe guides over the net and some files in game you can read.Partners: You can also choose to play with friends or NPCs if you want. Though some missions force you to play with an npc, the A.I is pretty good too. They can handle themselve, and will heal you if they can, and revive you if you are knocked out. You will be able to change the abilities of your A.I members. Like increasing the chances to get rare drops after a mission, setting up traps, or healing orbs for you to use.You can turn Hibari the operatior or character chat off if you don't want audio updates during the fight. Like the boss is running or 10 minutes left.As for the Voice Acting and MusicI liked the voices in Resurrection. If you are expecting a Japanese dub option you will not get one here. It is all English. There are a few returning voices. Lindow, Soma, Alisa, Kota just to name a few. The music is same from the PSP version, but there are a few updated songs introduced into the game.The game does get a little repetitive especially at the start where you spend a lot of time killing small Aragami for the first few chapters, and ""Fallen"" (different coloured) Aragami after that. The enemy bosses do have a habit of running away from you through out the fight. Causing you to chase them. It does get a tad annoying.Even so God Eater is still a pretty fun game, especially with friends."

,Recommended,460870,33642869,Posted: 18 July,all,Wolves2145,"To be fair, I started playing the game after the animated adaptation that came out 5 years after the game first came out. Despite the fact that it is 2 years older now it feels amazing. The graphics are nice and frankly my oly complaint is the lack of maps. The color palette is fitting for the apocalypse however there are moments were I would like mor green then gray but I am fine with it. The wide range of weapons and combinations allow for a lot of variations for gameplay With such a wide range of enemies I cannot say I throughly enjoy them all. Despite me liking them I don't like the fact that 75% of the creatures are reskins of other enemies. Yet in the end I love this game and I can say that I would reccomend this game as it holds a great soundtrack and fun gameplay."
,Recommended,460870,33873800,Posted: 28 July,all,Xarai,"TL; DR: Fun game, probably best with friends. A bit repetitive.After trying monster hunter on ds, I was kind of appaled by the fact you couldnt log on, and it just seemed like an incredibly dull game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. This game seems to do a fair bit of the monster hunter type stuff, but a lot better.The characters are good. The story is passable. The art is fairly nice, but for some reason the main character literally never says a word in cutscenes. They paid a voice actor to say some throw away lines in actual missions such as ""I can't lose here. I have to be strong for the others"" and ""great work team. Let's get home and relax."" And then they have cutscenes where they show the main character being silent. Luckily the other characters are pretty good so although its annoying, it isnt unbareable.My major annoyance with the game are the enemies. The way you character attacks varies upon the kind of weapon (eg long sword, short sword, sythe, hammer) which is cool. You can change your gamestyle to match the kind of enemy you are going against.The problem is that enemies are better than you in every single way, but this doesnt make the game hard, just makes some fights a complete chore. For example, there is a kinda lion like monster that is about 2 times as tall/big as your characters. Every attack hits you for somewhere between 1/2 and 1/4 health. Almost every main enemy in the game attacks constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY. This lion thing has a ""charge' attack that puts 5 balls of lightning in front of it. It will stand there with this wall of lightning for a few seconds. This is the only time it stops attacking, but if you get hit by the lightning in an attempt to get close, it just goes back to attacking. It jumps 2-3 seconds character sprinting worth. It swipes its paws. It dashes over and over. And when you get it low, it does this all impossibly fast. You will eventually whittle it down and kill it, but it takes so long because its health bar is invisible, and you have to chase it around the room, trying to get hit in while it does its dash attack.It's fun. It's not perfect, but its fun. Will you get your money's worth by the time the annoying way the enemies constantly attack/take no damage drives you away from the game? I would think so. Will you finish it? Maybe. But if you did, I fear it would just be from a desire to finish the game, not for continued fulfilment."

,Recommended,460870,35067372,Posted: 19 September,all,Xaelath,"Great game but short and a mess.[Completion 80-100 hours or lesser]God Eater Resurrection is a remake of the 1st game.It introduce the Predator Mode which allows you to select any kind of Control unit devour type that amazingly works very well compared GE2RB Blood Art system.It allows to select 5 different type of unit including effect that you'll unlock in the game as you clear the story and extras.The effect can be adjusted to anything you liked or needed against aragami.The remake includes some features that available on GE2RB such as Personal Ability,Weapons, Survival Missions (!),Short Scene,and Abandoned God Arcs System. (The character creation follows GE2RB but have different costume and hair + flair/hats).However the main issues followed with :Its short, especially when you rush the mission. If you think its harder than GE2RB then let me give you a tips. Simple bullet module + HDH with the following Trigger Happy+Frugal Combo or you just melee the♥♥♥♥♥♥out while wasting bullet use Shotgun and Sniper. Assault and Blast gun is kinda terrible here even using Meteor bullet is more a hassle than faster.Following the story, the only changes is after God Eater Burst that adds like 6-9 Scene that seems barely polished to Continue Shio Story and that just it. Its basically unecessary extras. You wont be missing anything if you already played GEB.Bugs bugs its the Damn AI bugs again. Similiar with God Eater 2 Rage Burst this game had this bug too. AI cant devour properly, fail to charge devour/buster and stuff. But they still give you alot of bullet  if you need it due Predator system allow you to Devour faster compared Normal devour system. They still fail to time the blocking though.Theres also specific bug in Survival mode due its not originally made for GER and theres no story that utilize Survival mode. If you allow AI to kill themself and hit 0 Endurance the game will crash right after the Menu before the camp.Another weird stuff is that the game dosnt had multiplayer chat issue regarding crash in GE2RB. So feel free to use chat here.Lacks customization , Even some NPC DLC/Costume that available on GEB isnt here. Yes its not about the port but the game seems rushed for some reason. Its the same engine as GE2RB but they didnt bother to polish it although it came free with GE2RB they charge it for 20 bucks in PS4 and Vita.The good stuff  :Like i mentioned Predator mode. It allows you to adjust any specific aragami you need to fight, either you want go with support build, melee/gun, brutal, tanky af, supporting by buffing your teammates, changing weapon elementa.l All of them available on predator mode on 5 different adjustable effect. Compared GE2RB that mostly focused on a single Blood art to use for different aragami which i found hassle at the time. In the end [for GE2RB] you'll only need Blood art with the highest and proper damage conditions than adjusting skill against specific aragami. So its a win on GER.Equipment Upgrade system its more fair and worth keeping than GE2RB version. It allows you to get 4 Effects for 1 stat for base skills instead giving you 1-2 effects like GE2RB.There might no OP Skill effect or 4 Skill effect found as AGA but its not really necessary since i already mentioned its quite balanced than getting 99999 dmg. You can any necessary skill effect than focused on Damage building.The Voice Actor for Protag. Yep its better and unique for English one though, JP is original so i doubt its a flaw since they mostly hire B-A grade VA. The Pakaki? what his name again? Pailor Sakaki? Might as well mute him when he talked. So Here GER have unique personality for protagonist VA than GE2RB although its just a side stuff and not really affecting gameplay it still rates the game performances.ConclusionOverall it gave better performances but maybe equal or better experience(?) than GE2RB but with some noted flaw, i found it enjoyable at the times though theres barely anything special on it.Since its free and come with GE2RB bundles you can try it if you liked the 2nd and wanted to check the 1st one.You can always skip to the story and do the cheesy guide to follow the story (i skipped most of the story till lindow part).As someone who already checked through many trainwreck port this one had to be one due crash,gameplay affecting experience although the Price somehow made a fair point."

If you have played the PSP version, you will understand this.They have added new weapons, techniques, upgrades and especially, various types of devouring. which makes this game more refreshing to me. They also added new difficulties aaaaaand NEW ARAGAMIS to the hunt.The other is the story, while it is the same one in the PSP version, they have added new voice lines thoughout the story, which makes the characters more lively.The graphics are also noticeable, which are great.Also, i mentioned that they have added new difficulties, right? YES, this means new story arc is also added to the game!!(This really made me surprised)The only thing that bothered me are the character's new voice lines, some of them are good but others doesnt seem...right. And it is very different from the PSP version(cause i can still remember some lines in there).I would recommend using a controller for full nostalgia, but that is your choice.All in all, it is still a great game. 9/10. Would eat an aragami again."

,Recommended,460870,35503050,Posted: 5 October,all,┼ CBlade ┼,"★★✯☆☆First off ignore the error message on steam “English language not supported This product does not have support for your local language. Please review the supported language list below before purchasing” this is because you cannot buy the game on steam as it is included for free with the sequelhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/438490/GOD_EATER_2_Rage_Burst/This game just barely gets a positive review from me. Now the reason for me giving this game just barely a pass is as follows, the game has very repetitive gameplay and you need to complete about 4 missions which can take anywhere between 10 to 20 minutes before each cutscene or plot progression section in the game.Rough summary of what to expect, this game is basically BANDAI’s anime-styled Monster Hunter game focused more on story and world-building, which it does just fine but the combat while good gets old fast.For me the main thing driving me forward was the story, the gameplay is nice but the enemies just have too much life and that results in taking far to long in taking them down and makes the game very repetitive. The game really shows that it was intended for on the go gaming, if you were to just play this game once a day and just do one mission while you were killing time at family or something then I can understand the way it plays, then it will get a 4/5, but this is the PC port so it is judged as a PC game, and as a PC game it gets a 2.5/5 from me, just barely a good game… It does a lot of things really good but the fights just take to long.Anyways, onto the other points, the story was nice, really threw me for a loop a few times, good final boss battle, nice way of upgrading and creating gear in the game, the port does come with all the DLC as well but I have yet to get to them as my main motivation to continue the game was the story and having completed that I have no motivation to continue for the DLC.So, in conclusion, if you like monster hunter style games then this is for you, however, be aware that combat takes a lot longer here and can get quite repetitive. 2.5/5!!!PS the keyword was repetitive if you didn’t notice XD."
