,Recommended,460960,22918293,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,Evil incarnate,"This is the sequel to the hugely overlooked, obscure mystery detective 'The Deed', RPG made by Pilgrim Adventures; who are slowly climbing up my ladder of favourite indie developers. Dynasty expands on the original's concept and foundation with deeper storytelling, more and diverse characters, who strangely seem to be incredibly memorable despite their generic appearance and names. This could be due to the fact this game's art style, whilst looking plain and brown, strikes a resemblance of old school mixed with modern sprite work.Of course, the meat of this and the prequel game is the ""choices matter"" mechanic. Does it work? In short, yes. Yes yes yes yes yes yes! Whilst the game is limited in scope due to its short, linear nature and small world to explore, which isn't a bad thing I might add, the idea that you will be judged for your actions and un-actions is a satisfying, tense experience. Knowing that if you talk to him, or her, and collect this or that, will definitely effect the outcome is immersive and thrilling, and graphics be damned. Without specific spoilers, here's an example. To have the murder look like somebody else committed it, you'll be required to talk to a certain character and ask them about the character you want to frame to learn more about their past, which you'll use against them in the chain of evidence you have setup against them. I would say it's more about finding the ""correct"" choices to make to win the game than having absolute freedom to do anything and get away with it, which again, I actually find to be a logical game design choice.Audio wise... meh, it could be better, but it isn't explicitly terrible or unpleasant. I like the BGMs, but I would like to see things like footsteps and ambience added just to put the cherry on the cake. But please, keep the no voice acting. I love to read and I love reading the dialogue with my own voice that I allocate to these characters, much like a novel. In this game, the lack of voice acting, I think, enhances the atmosphere and enjoyment.I'll re-iterate the character portraits and art style again. Somehow, for some reason, I really love them. Yes, they are just plain blank faces, but the way they are styled and portrayed is... cool...? I would like to see this style return for a potential sequel, among all the other compliments as above.For the negatives, I think the inherit bias towards the player character should be dropped and less alibis for the NPCs to be limited to only 1 or 2 and not all of them. It's quite annoying to have a sheriff turn up and immediately suspect you just because he hasn't heard your name before. Also the sound design complaint as above.To finish this review, and if the developer bothers to read this far down, I would like to say I love The Deed and this game, but I would LOOVVEEE to see a game made by them where YOU are the detective, and YOU solve a murder mystery - where the killer is random per playthrough, in the style of The Deed games.Again, great sequel this is bar some personal gripes, well worth the asking price and more!"

It isn't at all necessary to have played that game first though, as both games have storylines that are completely independent of each other. In this game, the objective remains the same - find a way to kill someone you hate, and get away with it! Compared to the first title,Dynastyhas 3 different stories (instead of just 1), set in 3 different time periods, involving 3 different main characters. The stories are not linked in any way, except that the character you play comes from the Bruce family.Yay!+ This game offers 3 stories instead of 1, at the same kind of price point as its predecessor.+ All the stories are fairly interesting.+ 3 different locations and settings to explore.+ Each location is nicely designed and period-appropriate.+ Music and ambience are not bad.+ Reasonable range of murder weapons to choose from.+ Murder methods are fairly interesting and some yield amusing results.+ You can use either the mouse or keyboard to play.+ More difficult/challenging than its predecessor.+ Much more gameplay time compared to before.+ High replayability, especially if you want to try out all murder weapons and get all possible endings.+ Loads of achievements.Nay.- You can't really ""win"" on the very first try because there's no way you can predict what characters will say in response to your questions, and the questions are vital to producing evidence for a frame-up.- A few spelling/grammar errors here and there.-BUG:Pressing F12 to exit the game at any point causes a crash.VerdictI grabbed this at S$0.90 during sale.

For the price you are getting your money's worth at least.The games biggest strength is that it gives you more of what made the first game interesting. Its biggest weakness is it adds nothing new while wearing out the formula, making it somewhat of a dissapointment. And it follows that formulaexactly to the letterfor all 3 scenarios. Gather incriminating evidense  and weapon, dinner, then plant the evidense and commit the deed.This would really have worked out better if expanded on instead of just being rehashed. Ironicly the first game feels like it has more depth than this 3 scenario sequal - you'd think we're getting 3x as much game but it doesn't feel like as much time was spent on this.If a 3rd game gets made, I hope the developers don't just reuse the same template again. reverse clue is really fun and if it can be made to not be so repetitive it'll have a lot of replay value, which is where both games fall short right now."

The first takes place in 1401 (England & Scotland), the second in 1868 (Kansas/USA) and the third in 1895 (Scotland again).The main concept is that the player assassinates someone(e.g. the English governor who betrayed and abandoned the player's mother in the 1401 story thus causing her untimely death)and then tries to get away with it by blaming others for the murder and planting incriminating evidence into their bags or rooms etc.It seems easy, but it is not, especially if someone wants to get all 53 achievements. I found 1 achievement particularly difficult to obtain. The ""1868 : on the run/become a fugitive"".In general it is a fun game and I wished to see all possible endings (that's why I played it for so many hours).I highly recommend it, especially if it is on sale!"

This is due largely to the quality of the dialogue and the variety of evidence, characters, and murder weapons. Also, there are options to set it up as a suicide, so if you like characters you don't need to frame them.Ton of achievements available for hunters.More of a realistic style art, as opposed to anime like many of these games. Not commenting on personal preference, just find that this is a style that better suits this particular theme as it is more serious than comical/cute.

I've tried quite a bit of RPGMaker games, and almost all of them seems to be carbon copies of one another.My impression changed after I tried the first scenario. This is an entirely different approach on using RPGMaker to create games. Instead of RPG, what I got is a ""Create your own story (of murders)"". Truly different than other RPGMaker games.Visual Novel fans and/or mystery lovers should give this game a chance."

The weapons and environment vary greatly from story to story, along with the reason why you are committing the murder. Even though the actual goal is a little repetitive, all the different dialogue choices and possible outcomes make this game very exciting. The achievements are a great way to keep track of the endings you've already gotten. If you thought the Bruce family was interesting before, wait until you see their dark lineage."

If you enjoy the idea of making the perfect kill, evading and fooling the police and getting away scott free, then you should take a closer look at this game.This release was a quite a suprise to me, I enjoyed the first game, but never expected a sequel. Fortunately its a good suprise, and anyone who enjoyed the first game will enjoy this game, with more refined gameplay and three scenarios to play instead of one.The core gameplay involves finding an item and weapon that incriminates your patsy (or an item that leaves the impression the target took their own life), then planting that item in the right place so the police find it, and using the weapon to kill your target. If all goes well then the police will find the item in their search and that combined with the weapon you used makes your patsy look suspicious enough for them to be arrested. You will also need to minimise suspicion against yourself, for example in one scenario bringing up an argument with the victim makes the police suspect you more, but changing the subject allows you to avoid the suspicion.Environments are small, but this allows you to really understand the environment and people in it, allowing you to easily execute your devious plan and control the way events proceed. The only real flaws this game has are repeated dialogue getting tedious as you replay scenarios and cases where the your own plan isn't one the game designers thought of (however I haven't run into this situation yet).There are three scenarios in this release, and I've only played one and still I can wholeheartedly reccomend this game, its a unique experiance worth playing especially for such a low asking price. If you're still skeptical then I can reccomend the first game in the series which is only $1 so you have little to lose."

It has three different stories with different timelines. The main characters are all related I guess. There are many different ways to frame each person. Or you could make the murder unsolved by not framing anyone(or try to frame everyone) and also remove every suspicion from yourself. You can choose from many different muder weapons and evidences to plant.What I like most about this game is that the characters remember every word you said and it could be used against you during the interrogation. Once you understand how it works, you will know the right thing to say to throw suspicion on people.I recommend you play it if you like murder mysteries :D"

The characters are interesting and the dialogue are engaging. I wish I can recommend this game to my friend but I think the language barrier is kinda hard for them (or me *glance at caught for 10x*).I don't really like the third scenario though (1895).

I placed it on the best friend who seemingly had money problems (ohohoho!). Needless to say, I lucked out a bit there, but my plan was -- initially -- to place the blame on a mysterious indebted vagrant, but I just placed the finance letter in John's room (realising that I would be the prime suspect for mysterious strangers!) and called it quits.2nd one wasn't so lucky. I intended to do away with both Bill and his menacing right hand man in a sort of play on poetic justice. Unfortunately, luck was against me and I failed miserably.The 3rd scenario was perhaps the most complex (or perhaps not!), where I could hardly hide my clamour that someone had taken all the credit for my character's work (a hatred of which I can personally relate to), so it was truly impossible to try to pin the impending crime solely on suicide, when It became apparent that I had written the novels.Hopefully I can prove my innocence despite this on following playthroughs! The craftmanship that went into this game is incredible, and better than many Triple A titles in my opinion.I would wholeheartedly recommend buying this game, and it's predecessor if you have the chance! It's truly a remarkable, and wonderous experience! If there is any word of a sequel, best hold onto your hat's because that might just be one of the best games on steam (if they keep it up, which I have high hopes of thus far)!"

It features three new murder scenarios set in three different time periods with different casts, they are all (almost) up to par with the original though there is little variety. The original had a bit more depth, such as flashbacks that could be encountered in the household, but overall all murder scenarios are of a good quality. However, despite them taking place in different time periods they are all quite similar, since while the story and characters change the mechanics do not. It also does not expand on the original formula, it is the same game except three times as large. With that said, I liked the first game, meaning I also like this one. The dialogue trees are quite intricate and do remember a lot of details, and with the numerous ways to assassinate the targets you can get lots of different endings. The writing itself is good, and the characters, while not memorable, certainly do feel real. If you like interactive storytelling I would reccomend this to you, especially with its low price.

There are a wide number of outcomes based on your every action and interaction with others.The game is in fact a sequel for the game ""The Deed"". To be precise, it is a sequel that is a prequel which expands on the ""Bruce"" bloodline introduced in the first game with 3 new stories set in older eras. While the first game only had one scenario, ""The Deed: Dynasty"" is, in a sense, like an expansion pack which maintains the general gameplay formula and offers 3 new scenarios with a lot more interesting characters, stories, and motives for murder.While I had never been a fan of such genre, this game has definitely enlightened me to it with the abundant amount of various paths and outcomes it offers under the objective of murder.

The 3 new scenarios have excellent variety in terms of settings and characters and allow for interesting creativity for how you go about trying to pull off the crime and get away with it. I also liked how the last scenario here ties things together with the first game, appropriately in a bittersweet way.However, as much as I appreciate having more scenarios included, the original game had only one, and the dialogue choices here pose a bit more of a challenge, at least initially, I miss some of the odd humor that could found in the first Deed. More often than not these choices would very much derail your attempt to commit a perfect murder, but I also believe added to the replay value. There was entertainment, even if your character is doing everything spectacularly wrong.In any case, I still strongly recommend The Deed: Dynasty. The developer is excellent and delivers great value for a very fair price.

The main characters seem to be related, only in different time periods. Much like Hitman, you have a variety of ways to murder your target. The goal of the game is to not get caught, as you may plant evidence on others etc.While it is a great time killer, I wish there were more stories! Altough the game is only 3$ I think the devs could have made a few extra stories. Non the less, I highly recommend this game. If you are going to buy it however I feel you should get the bundle that includes ""The Deed"" and ""The Deed; Dynasty"""

However, it's a bit odd how the levels become easier instead of harder. I started from the bottom just by random luck and I noticed not only the difficulty increasing but the story becoming a little worse. Third level is the most easy and interesting. Second level is a bit hard but still have a pretty nice story. First level has a nice setting, but is not as intriguing as the other levels and is pretty hard.Anyway, nice to have multiple levels with this kind of puzzle since I really like it. This is a very good game in general and I totally recommend you to check it, especially if you liked the first one."

The areas were more fleshed out, and the motives for all three murders were something I could get behind.  Sure, the sister from the first game was a b!t(4, but the motive was just greed.  Boring.  Not to sound like a potential killer, but these three are actually getting what's coming to them.  Very satisfying, supposing you get away with it.Happy Hunting!"
76561198015324296,Recommended,460960,35443294,Posted: 3 October,all,leuh gégé,"Very nice adventure game, wisely using the RPG Maker programming. I recommend it without any hesitation.The 3 different stories to achieve take place in well rendered historical English and American backgrounds (XIXth century and before).If you like detective games (although The Deed Dynasty is not one per say), if you enjoy paying attention to details on the scenes and in the dialogues, this game is for you, especially if you enjoyed the first act (The Deed). The Deed Dynasty is far more solid and a bit longer.All  your actions and answers may have unexpected consequences.There are many ways to end the game and this gives a lot of replay value to it untill you get the deed done and everyone convicted, but you ;)Even at full price it's a must have !"
