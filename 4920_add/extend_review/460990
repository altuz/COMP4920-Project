The flying stingray monster is just a whale model, modified/crossed with the stingray model. When it's close enough, you can see that it has a whale's body/face/tail, except for the added wings. (Is the whale one of the default model from Vive SDK or something?)2). The art direction/color choice, is pretty meh to me. Neither cool, enchanting nor elegant.3). The events that 'unfold' within the 6 minutes are pretty meh... the only kinda cool thing happened too far away to observe or 'feel', and there's no way to see it closer.4). Did I mention that there's only one scene and you can't seem to move at all from your initial location? Or did I miss that option."

No. But is it beautiful, and etherial, and gorgeous, and when the night falls it gets even better? Yes.A few caveats, this is not a game where you will be doing much. This is an experience, think of it like a music video, and if that sounds worth the money to you, jump in.I personally love this kind of stuff, want more surreal experiences."

,Recommended,460990,25808423,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,ultimateoutsider,"This is a beautiful fantasy/sci-fi VR experience with visuals that are subtly synced to a symphonic score. I've heard several people compare the setting to Avatar's Pandora, but the world here has its own palette and its own mysteries. I hear there is some interactivity if you have motion tracking controllers, but I am a Rift user, and currently only have Xbox controllers, so I can't speak to that aspect of the product. It has been enough for me to just be able to look around (you'll probably want to be standing for this one) and let things play out.The default mode of this program is to play an almost 6-minute-long scene to the included score, but you can adjust it to disable the built-in music and sync some of the visual effects to whatever music is playing on your computer's default audio device. (I tried this with some Alan Walker YouTube videos playing in a browser window on the desktop and this worked out really well.)If you're the first person in your family or circle of friends to have a Rift or Vive, this is a quick and easy way to demonstrate the power and promise of VR. It's not a game (nor is it marketed as such), and it's not a typical narrative story. Rather, it is a brief but wonderfully executed interlude on an alien landscape, and I really hope to see more experiences like this in the future."

But very short (5-6 minutes) and only one ""level"". However, you can use your own music and adjust the experience playtime to the music. No option to interact with anything."

However, I was hoping for something more.  It builds up, but nothing very interesting happens.  I would say the price is a bit steep as well, this experience is worth 3 dollars at most.  As a fellow developer, I recommend lowering the price on this a bit."

,Not Recommended,460990,25407065,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,IronPanda,"I like the idea but this isn't worth $5.- you can use different music with it but the stock audio effects are mediocre at best and not immersive.- it's 'Impossible' but you're standing in tulips. With some mushrooms nearby and a cherry tree in blossum above. Plus a familiar looking flying whale.If this had some truly strange environment, boundaries that don't break immersion when you near the edge to look down, a decent audio soundscape, the ability to move or perhaps teleport to other spots/return to the travel bureau and choose other destinations then yes.TheBlu, Temple of Aspara, Irrational Exuberance are better demos and if i wanted to sit and listen to an album i'd be inclined to do it in something like SkyTower."

,Recommended,460990,25348830,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,Shark,"Pretty cool experience, relaxing atmosphere. The provided music may only last 6 minutes, but the real appeal is the ability to play your own music in the background while using the environment/island as a visualizer (you can also set the time on your ""trip"" to match your playlist or song(s)). Will likely be using this to relax/decompress well into the future, definitely going to get my $5 worth."

Child like, 6 mins, pretty flowers and lights with a flying thing. For two bottles of coke it worth it."
,Recommended,460990,25310939,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,curio,"Nice little experience similar in concept to The Blu, and also in a similar price bracket (considering this is just one scenario whereas The Blu has three). Where The Blu offers a realistic underwater setting, this one's more of a fantasy/sci-fi one high up in the air. The classical music can be replaced by one's own and the length of the experience adjusted accordingly. Yes, it's only about 6 minutes of content, but I for one am not regretting the purchase. Here's hoping that travel agency will get additional destinations down the road!"

I am sorry, but it is not worth the price. There is only 1 scene and you can't move. The art direction is average at best. For the price there are much better VR experience out there. I don't know, but this looks like it was throw together in one afternoon quickly.Or did I miss the way to actually travel?"

76561197974780310,Not Recommended,460990,25368355,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,Doright,"Great concept (ala Fantasia) that I really, really wanted to like. Just to many shortcuts taken that break the immersive fascination that should have been central to implementation. For instance mechanical single joint flapping of pterodactyls. Whale+ray shows a distinct lack of imagination. Pedals falling in a very simplistic motion. Motion of flowers, pterodactyls flocks, etc not organic at all. At best this is a concept demo, not a full fledge consumer release.On the plus side the music integration is a great idea and the visual potential is there.I'll be watching for updates and more content from this studio but very cautious about further purchases."
