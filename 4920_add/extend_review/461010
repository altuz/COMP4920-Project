76561198140299850,Recommended,461010,22465717,"Posted: 16 April, 2016",all,foofaraw,"""Roll'd"" is a really surprisingly fun game. I bought it due to my prefererence for SAS (short attention span) games and multiple levels to be unlocked with a gradual progression. Figured if I played for an hour it would be reasonable at this remarkably low price. After three days I have most of the achievements and have passed level 40 (of 50 for which achievements are offered.)The premise of Roll'd is that instead of the character moving, the path does. Perhaps a small change, but a very nice variation from the norm. At various points new levels and variations are unlocked, as well as new and bizarre ""runners"". The numerous paths may only be different in appearance, but they certainly look VERY different, and give the feel of not being at all similar in gameplay. If it's an illusion, it's a good one.The art and music of Roll'd are really nice, and all in all this is a remarkable game for this low price of less than a dollar. If you like dexterity or running games, Roll'd is certainly one to be considered near the top of the list for players of all ages.Thank you."

As simple as those mobile port games are, Roll'd also means to quick react, but this time you turn the whole track around you while your charakter is running on a fix position. If you enter a curve in a too sharp angle you die. Uphill or downhill doesn't matter.Speaking of characters there was once this half-animated Disney movie called ""G-Force"" with a pretty lame story but cute guinea pigs. Well some characters in this game seem to be stolen from that but it doesn't help to hide the massive flaws that are implemented. Balance Achievements of normal and hard seem to be mixedup, the upleveling is unclear and the randomly stiched together curves are sloppy rendered and have micro-gaps. You don't even know visually what you are doing wrong, only hear your pig squeaking.Ofc the game has also some nice feature like 4ppl online MP on splitscreen, a global ranking and again a bunch of characters to unlock but unfortunately with no other behaviour (just other skins). But to levelup to level50 can be a bit of grinding if you already beat the highscores in all difficulties. So you must force yourself through this endless rollercoaster to make it 100% in the end ..."
,Recommended,461010,23569342,"Posted: 15 June, 2016",all,icarus,"Simple endless runner game which is suitable to be played in short sessions when you are bored.You start as a pig character, running on a roller coaster terrain, which you will have to balance with the right and left keys to prevent your character from falling off to your death. With only 2 keys to control, it sounds simple but that couldn't be further from the truth. It has quite a learning curve, and in the beginning, you will die a lot of times within seconds of the game, making you want to rage quit and throw your keyboard / mouse at the wall. However, once you get the hang of it, the fun starts. You get to level up, and unlock more characters, themes / locations and difficulties (easy, normal, or hard). The variety is quite extensive, and will definitely keep you playing for some time.  The background music is a mix bag of soothing music to chiptunes, depending on the location, which sometimes may be annoying.Overall, a good game well worth the cheap admission price!"

,Recommended,461010,24344211,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,AstroGirlBunny,OMG! Got this game for 49 cents. Wow! Well worth much more. The sound of the pig's squel as he's falling is a bit haunting. It takes you a few tries to get used to it. And then you realize you have to keep the world rotated back and forth to keep it level for the poor pig. I love how he waves his arms around when he's starting to get off balance. It's cute! I sometimes have a short attention span and like how I can really enjoy five minutes (or less) playing this. Warning - it's kind of an addictive game. I love that they have different costumes for the pig. And different 'worlds' and from easy to hard difficulty. I've gifted it to some friends and they already love it as well. It's 49 cents! Why are you still reading this? Buy the dang game!

It's kinda like the little marble you had to get through the maze/labyrinth toy or the old school Monkey Ball video game. You use the keys A and D to move the ROAD !, not the character.. up and down to make the character walk with as little effort as possible. If not, he falls off screaming in pain. An agonizing fall to his/her death... Witch can be funny when playing characters like Sir Dinkalot ( a pig). With Levels and themes to unlock during the game, by the more you play levels, themes and characters. The soundtrack was kinda of a retro 8/16 bit throwback. Nothing hugely catching like Double Dragon II  Escape into the forrest. butt fun. With about 25 unlockable skins/ 5 theme backgrounds and 4 difficulty settings, its a fun game to challange yourself. Makes walking or taking a stroll a little a-bit diffrent next time, if you think of it this way..."

,Not Recommended,461010,31621799,Posted: 8 May,all,Verdantil,Tags: Casual - RunnerAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: TrashReview: Games adds large sidebars so it did not have to bother changing the play area from the mobile version. The Xbox 360 pad stick made the adjustments to the rotation move by large increments at once im guessing the controls were better fine tuned for the Ipad's gyroscope. Otherwise all you do is rotate the screen to give an always mostly flat surface for an endless runner 2d sprite to run on. You will fail often and the sound of death will get grating FAST. The music is nothing but a couple notes looping.

Aesthetically its a good looking game, especially with the landscapes, there's replayabilty for sure and is actually quite addicting.

I will say however that the only reason I thought to purchase the game was with a 75% discount. For 25 cents I'd say it's worth it, good to relax and zone-out"

Even the easy levels can be quite difficult at first. So if you get easily frustrated by that sort of thing, you might not like this game. I'd recommend it because it's the kind of game you can pick up and play, for five minutes or a couple hours. It's actually quite addictive. Steam achievements, along with a small price tag, make Roll'd a good addition to anyone's Steam library."
