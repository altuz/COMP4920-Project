For example going out, climbing up a tree and jumping off head first feels like a better idea over playing this thing.Cons:- You can actually get cancer from this game- Controls are simply chaotic for item usage- Store sometimes makes the game freeze for 2min- For such a kids game, levels are incredibly hard and most likely you won't spend enough time in this game to complete the first level- Keeping in mind that it's only 16 cents on sale, it still feels waaaaaaay overpriced. Don't think anyone would play this ""masterpiece"" even if it was f2p game."

,Not Recommended,461140,24064839,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,OrwellianStuff,"Holy smokes. I was wondering how poor games can get on Steam, and bought this.First impression? Obviously QUALITY CONTROL - M.I.A! Seriously, if I had the choice, I would not have passed this game. The fact that the original asking price is 0,99€ for this sounds like a joke. I'd say this game has, at most, the standard of a mediocre Gamedev 101 course exercise, not beyond that.The game is riddled with badly tested, ill-designed and/or nonfunctional mechanics. The character can fall through moving platforms with no reason whatsoever. Jump and movement mechanics, while not exhibiting the vertical direction lock as in Action 52, are not as fluid as they could be. Objects are misleading - a candy bar can lead to death when rotated to one side, but not when to an another? Store mechanics seem to work, but the GUI is hastily done as texts do not indicate their user interface behavior, either by mouseover color change or any other means. The store seems to work somewhat, but due to the problematic mechanics, I have not been able to test them to their full potential. The store, and dying also induces major lag, which has crashed the game several times when I tested it.Music is.. eh, practically nonexistent - the only thing I heard is the same short piano clip as in the trailer - but only in the main menu.  I've been unable to turn music on for the main game, even though I've clicked the button for it. Sound effects do also exist, but are very repetitive. As of graphics, they seem to generally have some relation as to what they represent - however, the lack of graphics design is painfully obvious with cheesy, non-uniform environments and obviously stretched textures.The idea does have potential, I give it that. But the frankly atrocious implementation renders the game unable to render any reasonable value to its player beyond being comic relief for its bad design.The maker of this game needs major remedial education in programming, testing, game design.. perhaps music and arts classes could also do positive things for the possible future ventures of the author. If one is not interested in supporting the developer in their development with this kind of show for the work, or buying poor games for comic relief, they should ask for a refund."

I did not expect much buying this game as I paid 16 cents anyways, but I was hoping that it was at least so-so written (talking about the source here). Unfortunately, this game just turns out to be another cheap opportunity to recieve 4 steam-trading cards for a reasonable price which is kinda sad as that is not really what a game is supposed to be about.To sum it up, do not make the same mistake and spend your cents on some ice-cream or something, just not this game.I hope I was able to help ya guys with this review.Cheers!"

This little rascal loves sweets and big, very big - no - HUGE SWEET CAKES!This game is all about sweets as you might have realized and you can make Klabi's sweet dream(s) come true. In this simple platformer, you play Klabi in his dream through levels of raining sugar, dropping calorie bombs and sticky sticks of rocks called candy sticks, meow!Attention Kids! Klabi's dream can turn into a sour nightmare before he reaches his goal to collect all the sweets to build his enormous pie. Because other little sweet-guzzlers appear and want to have a piece of the cake before Klabi even has all the ingredients.Klabi is a modern masterpiece. Games today like Final Fantasy XV(which will pale in comparison to this masterpiece) try so hard to emulate a long complex rich narritive. Klabi is different. The gameplay speaks its story, the graphics show the beauty of the game. Our main protagonist is a cat with an undying love for candy, he risks his life for candy will stop at nothing to get to it. Truely inspiring.However I have one complaint.In summary, Klabi is a masterpiece, it goes as far challanging the classic BAD RATSRelease Date: 22 Apr, 2016All in AllKlabiis a funny Adventure Game if you like Cat´s ;)9/10 From MeSweep"

If it weren't for the fact that the game hasn't a proper ending and never got one due to the dev going to jail before he could finish it, this game might be the best.I have put over 3,897 hours into this game on my alt acc, because of the large amounts of replayability it has. You can play it over 1000 times, and you'll still find new combos with items and accesories.The official OST only has one song in it, but it more than makes up for itself.After all this, I'll have to give Klabi a 9/10.

My friends are imaginary furries, bronies and anime body pillows. They told me that this game absolutely rocks. yeaaaahhhh. But there is one small problem. There are not enough obstacles in your way. And there are not enough bugs. You only glitch through the platforms 9 times out of 10. Should be 10. Then i would like this game even moar."
