,Recommended,461170,30643929,Posted: 20 March,all,Malkavian,"Disclaimer:This review is considerably lengthy. The abridged version is:buy it. I really enjoyed it, and I was also immensely bored so I decided to interrogate precisely why I enjoyed this game so much. The creator of the game, the whale husband, also personally worked incredibly hard on the game's art, sound, story and design --- and I'm a fan of that. Some spoilers throughout.Forks, Plates and Spoons: Attention to DetailKubrickian film theory fetishizes detail. Stanley Kubrick was infamously known for writing pages upon pages of stage directons that would tailor the objects, sets, costumes and more to unthinkable lenghts. This mastery of the mise-en-scene was not in vain, as his films  gained high praise as viewers would rewatch his films with sadistic scrutiny - extract all the information from every aspect of every scene because Kubrick would make every prop, every costume and every set ooze content like a pressed sponge. To a certain extent,Bucket Detectivereally captures that lust for details. It's a bit different, though. The playable world of the game is set entirely in an inner-city mansion. And sure, there is a great level of visual detail to which I'll get to in a second, butBucket Detectiveshines in its incredible sound design. Stand still in the mansion, and you'll hear it - flies buzzing in the distance, a faint air conditioner, wood flooboards streching, crisp footsteps and door creaks all manifest into an effectively eerie house ambience. The visual decor is just as effective. The halls have the right amount of minimalism to convince me the setting is real while instilling a surreal experience. Assaultingly white walls are painted with repetetive and abstract paintings (hand-drawn by the creator) and are frequently dressed with equally white forks, plates and spoons reminescent of how superflous royalty can be. I mean, you wouldn't use the utencils you would be hanging up all around your multi-level mansion, right? You'd have to constantly wash and put them back and forth multiple times a day in between meals and all that. Not worth it.I'd like to get into two specific aspects of level design before going forward: the shrines and book titles. Few things really drive in the cultish thematic more than Christian-influenced shrines honoring mysogynist conceptualizations of the female reproductive system and a lovecraftian abonimation made up entirely of throbbing tentacles. They were interactive as well. The player could kneel and marvel at the crude and horrific hand-made drawings of Fallopian tubes, penetration or a mansion overcome by incomprehensible flesh-like horror. Second, and this is truly a detail, the book titles are hilariously ironic and entertaining. Something like ""Slavery is Just a State of Mind!"" to ""A Brief History of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥: A Man's Perspective"" to ""Nazism: Another Chance!"". Some of the books are interactive and you can pick them up and read the front and back covers that feature hilarious reviews. This sort of detail really drives home the fact that the whale husband truly cares about this project, and takes his time to make sure, just like he does, to enjoy the little things. I'm only touching on the books because it actually ties to a larger quality I really love about this game and that's the script and writing behind it.Gwen Sleeveless or the tragedy behind the humorGwen Sleeveless is a pathetic character. A tragic story of a child raised in abandon as a servant to a deranged cult. You never meet him, at least physically, but by the end of the game, you will have in every other way possible. The writing behind this character's dialogue and voice acting bring him to life. His 'Gwen Boxes', journal pages and 'Garbage Room' all create incredibly visceral images of who he is. I could almost picture him, walking hunchback, giggling to himself at times, showing you around the mansion, marvelling with awe at every other room. The writing behind this character is funny, cringey, twisted and insightful. It fleshes out a character out of nothing -journal pages and the like. The cringe-inducing ""hahas"" at the end of tragically sad journal entries are the cherry on top. Gwen is by all means a 'nice guy' neckbeard, and that is revealed in a crucial piece of journal entry that simultaneously breaks the humorous spell of the game and shines some serious commentary on the dangers of cults.The note details Gwen's experience of bumping into Beth, the chosen female to give birth to the sacrificial baby. Beth details the horrors of the cult. How they abducted her, starve her, abuse her and♥♥♥♥♥♥her. Gwen responds with infuriating delusion, claiming the fathers of the cult would never do such a thing, and that she should stop lying. Later you find her dead by her birthbed.My point being that the writing is incredibly facetious and is conducive for us as players to indulge in the sick fantasy of the protagonist, but is also not afraid to momentarily break the spell and give a sobering account of an all to accurate account of the dangers of cults. The cutscenes have hilarious scripts, as well. They are written in a very 'broken english' type way but its purposefully done as the whole point is that the protagonist is a terrible writer that has to sell his soul for fame and sex.The BirthroomMassive spoilersA disturbing, gross yet entirely fitting ending arc forBucket Detective. A shining light of darkly wit writing. You spend most of the game interacting with yourself and with the voice of a ghost, just to be startled by a naked man with an odd mask blocking the entrance to the birthroom. The score gets kicked up a notch. Now there's an alarming guitar rift that serves to preface the end of the world. Moreover, arguably the best designed prayer spot is located here. Colorful depictions of a lecher fiend oozing itself into the mansion from every inch and every corner possible. An indistinguishable mass of flesh with multiple mouths. Beautiful hand-drawn illustrations. So you take off your clothes, step into the birthroom, see a dead Beth surrounded by deranged cultists, you pick up the baby, and you head to your inevitable death. You can potentially leave the house with and/or without the baby, and watch hilarity ensue through well-drawn and engaging alternate ending cutscenes. No, I take it back. Hilarity properly ensues if you crawl outside after cutting your legs. You become a perverted masochist who marries a dominatrix that takes care of your mutilated body. But hey, at least your happy and saw a beacon of morality at the end. The ending is the climax of all the good qualities of this game. The whale husband properly sets it up for that. You spend most of the game isolated, following seemingly arbitrary instructions only to be juxtaposed to the summoning of the Dark Lord. It's great, and funny. Go buy this game.If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group! It comes with a fun discord channel for horror fans to chill and game.Malkavian Madness"

76561198038866086,Not Recommended,461170,30091056,Posted: 21 February,all,Gluttony Slim,"At the end of the day, small art piece projects are always immensely subjective. I don't want to condemn the maker for making it or anything - I think it's worthy as a game and just not for me, and that's fine.On all the technical points it works well: the art style is cohesive, the game runs smoothly, the soundtrack is perfect. The cutscenes... work. It's well made as an indie game.It's billed as a comedy, my humor is pretty dark but it didn't really connect for me. There's definitely moments and phrases that you recognize as a joke but then don't laugh - that sort of sums up my experience.So I think it's worth it for the couple bucks, maybe, I won't refund my money because that's just cruel to devs, but overall I'm not sure I could think of any friends I'd be like ""oh, you HAVE to play this"" recommending it to."

That is to say, a la Marquis de Sade.Bucket Detectivecreates emotions and experiences so far removed from pleasure as to be alien even to disgust.

Not easy to recommend either, but I do."

Seriously, though, this game couldn't have possibly occured to me at a more fitting time in my life. Even before the commentary, looking at this game with the eyes of someone who wants so badly to start making games, and it being so strikingly similar to something I would create, I saw myself so much and it really struck deep (deeeeeeeep, scientifically of course). This game was just an amazing experience not only because of this personal reason, regardless, obviously, as it is simply a worthwhile thing to play --verymuch so. Just.. play it. It's fantastic.my only issue with it was that the dev commentary before last, in the birth room, can't really be heard because the awesome song is too loud over it"

It was depressing to hear just how not insane Jesse Barksdale is. He's painfully normal, and it ruined my expectation of an unmedicated madman making unhinged games."

If you've played the static speaks my name, you should know what kind of game The Bucket Detective will be. This game expands so much on the 10 minutes of pure intrigue that tssmn had though, adding more explanation to the world you're in but also even more intrigue and mystery.I got immediately sucked into the world of this game, the dark humor and semi-playful attitude it has is insanely interesting and fun to explore. The narrator and the character that you encounter through the game both added a lot of enjoyment for me.The ideal way to go into this game is to know absolutely nothing about it, just like the static speaks my name. Jesse Barksdale is amazing at creating these strange worlds that drag you in without making you actively suspend your disbelief.It's a bit of a short game, just over 120 minutes for 3 full playthroughs and 5 smaller ones to get the endings. Some people don't find that to be worth $4. But for that whole time I was actively engaged in the game and was loving every second. Can't wait to see what Jesse Barksdale & co come up with next."

If you come to it because you've played The Static Speaks My Name ... well, I think you will enjoy. It's not as surprising as that one, more of a B-movie feel, but BD is packed with quirky mysteries.If you haven't played the creator's other title, you will uncover a surreal game which combines the 'disturbing' with the 'humorous', that will feel like - well... Monty Python does a slasher movie. I must find a better analogy but this came up first. Be careful if you're squeamish, the game can be quite gory and crosses some disturbing lines."

,Recommended,461170,33501917,Posted: 13 July,all,A Well Worn Paint Job,"An interesting experience.Bucket Detective is a Dark Comedy/Horror game created by the mind behind 2015's ""The Static Speaks My Name"",And it shows very much.Bucket Detective features many of the same artistic choices that made The Static Speaks My Name so unique and memorable, while also being distinctively separate.Bucket Detective's main draw is it's extremely unique way of scaring the player, and it works damn well.Unlike The Static Speaks My Name, which drew its horror from the mysterious and depressing situation of the main character and it's frightening aesthetic/atmosphere, I feel that Bucket Detective draws its horror from the sheer absurdity and uncanniness of the world which the story takes place in.Unfournuatly, this is the game's biggest strength while also being it's biggest weakness.The lack of a relatable main character (Or even a silent one) in order to play to the uncanniness of the game's world means that a lot of the game's horror feels almost normal, given the state of the game's universe.I personally feel that the game would have benefited from having a more grounded/serious main character to make the whole experience feel more uncanny and scary, rather than a normal part of the game world.But I also don't believe this takes away from the game's overall experience, as this is still clearly a horror game.If you enjoyed the gameplay and writing style of The Static Speaks My Name, You're sure to enjoy this title, I know I did.6.5/10"

Despite that, it is a very enjoyable game to the very end. The quirky nature of it all and at times creepy feeling of it add to the charm of An Bucket Detective. This game has made me realise I too, could write great book for sex"

Very nice, make people happy.-I FRREAKING LOVE THIS GAME!There is a wonderful balance between humor and mischief. The simplicity really ties the ""Oh my God"" momments together. It's so right and so wrong at the same time. You really use your brain to solve all the secrets. I can't wait to see more work from these guys. Keep it creepy, it's OUTSTANDING!(P.S Every single piece of art made me smile. Probably one of the many wonderful things about this game.)"
