(about 1 hours of gameplay worth) there doesent seem to be any updates atm so im not sure how fast/active the developers are.The game has Great potential. but if the developers spend too much time gettin to a playable state. i belive the game is simply gonna die and never release properly.  its a 50/50 right now.. i would want more communication and content being pushed out alittle faster.. rather have small updates ever 1-2 weeks.. than have one major every 6 months(im not giving this a thumbs down because i dont like it.. but because myt gut feeling tells me its gonna die before it releases due to the lack of communication and updates)

,Not Recommended,461210,24646630,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,Tiny Satan,"Man oh man, where to even begin?Let's start off by saying yeah, it's early access but come on - there are some basic things that should not have been left out - you know, like a half arsed attempt at a tutorial, or a map marker, or heck - even just giving us a pick axe for supporting this game. Come on, scratch our backs a little bit here, devs.The mechanics are annoying. If you want to run anywhere, prepare for your hand to cramp holding shift + w, because you aren't even given a horse to begin with - even though similar MMO's like Star Stable, will at least be decent and give you your first mount.I can deal with the less than mediocre graphics, I can deal with the lack of character customization at the moment, and the tackless horses and the completely unrealistic 'taming' technique, but when you won't even give people who spend money on this game half a thought at an okay start well.. pfft. I wish I'd spent my $20 elsewhere.I hope it gets better but right now folks? Save your money."

The developers have officially abandoned this version of the game to make a singleplayer version of it that will be released on steam (according to themselves) but as a seperate game! This game has been abandoned, do not buy!

76561198052574541,Recommended,461210,25049160,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,Frimber,"Models&AnimationThe models are nice and all the joints are in the right place. I don't see a lot of clipping or stretching in the models; but the animations could use some major polishing. Pull the horse's legs in so they don't fly all over the place, straighten out the rider's jog, add in riding animations so the Player Character does more than just sit up there.Quests&ActivitiesWe could also use some gathering quests, or perhaps horse taming quests for some extra coin.Travel&NavigationIt would be nice if we could place map markers, or have the Player's location on the map. At the very least we should have a compass because it is easy to get lost. Even if we find a landmark we don't who what direction we are facing to use the map properly. So we can't locate each other.Opinions: So far this game has a lot of potintial. It looks nice, it runs well, I like it. The translations need a lot of work, but they get the point across. We could use more horse colors, for sure. And the starter horse needs to be WAY cheaper. 1000 currency for a ""Starter Horse""? No. I can buy 3 carrots and go tame my own for that price. And I have.The other problem is that the game really does not teach you how to make money. I hat to run around for over an hour before I even figured out where to buy tools. And It also took some doing to figure out that I couldn't smelt metal without a furnace. When I can create more complex things out of thin air, needing a smelter to make the base component is just weird.Suggestions:Fix up and smooth out the animations.Have a cursor sensetivity setting.Connect horse and player footfall sound effects to the animation, so they coordinate with the contact to the ground.Lower the Price of the Starter Horse.Add Quests that allow the player to earn money.Add a Compass. PLEASE.Player Sprint. Player Characters are so slow.Add horse follow. (Have the horse follow the player when summoned)Final Thoughts: I recommend supporting this game because it can do great things. Time will tell, seeing as the horse game market is so small."

I love it so far though and it has great potential.. Especially when the awesome developers keep us up to date! I bought this not knowing whether it would flourish, but I wanted to support this game as I was looking for a game like this for ages. They are about to add the editor and many more features and that gives me hope!Note: I am playing this game on a 2016 desktop computer (a fast one) and this game is still a little choppy. Not sure if it's because the game isn't optimized, or if it's because of computer. Just keep in mind that this is a big game and that your computer meets the requirements."

Basically, when you start the game you are in the middle of nowhere? Besides for that, this game has been out for quite awhile and I don't see much improvement. Its a fault on my part that I bought it and I hope it will be better in the future.I will check out the game updates every few weeks to see if it has improved. If I do seem to enjoy it later on I will fix this reveiw."

Overall, this feels much more pre-beta than beta.  It's tiring having company's upload so-called ""beta"" games, when they're far from even being beta quality, just to make an early buck. We don't mind supporting games early, but this surely wasn't worth it. We hold out hope they'll get past this and we may yet look at them again, but for now, I'd be careful with your $."

,Recommended,461210,30093371,Posted: 21 February,all,Hairy Goober,"Loads of potential, and pretty fun as is provided you've got a solid gaming PC. Once they add in V-sync and detailed options the optimization problems should disappear. Has quite a bit of construction options in the build mode (you can build stuff basically anywhere in the game world), plus you can lead your horses and tie them to something so they won't run away (9 times out of 10 they will run off if you don't do this). Taming for now works the same as the old multiplayer version, feed a wild horse a carrot and you have a friend for life.The one complaint I've had for a while is not being able to see your position on the world map, you have to memorize landmarks for the time being so as not to get lost. Owned horses also aren't marked, so if one of yours runs off finding it can be interesting.Updates are pretty slow, about one a month, but they usually add quite a bit to the game. Current demo is literally the game as of this review, so you can see all there is on offer right now...but as development progresses the demo will not be updated."

You spawn in the middle of no where when you start the game and theres no way to get back to the main menu, you have to rejoin and then your at the menu. It's stupid b/c when they ask u to feed ur horse you can't. You can't ride it bc u need to earn its trust and theres no dang way to pet it or feed it. If you log out and your horse isn't in a enclosed area, then it disapeers and u have torestart the whole game. When you start out with your first quest, u have to go down to a barn and pick up hay, whih is more difficult then you think and its extermly boring. After you finish the mine quest, I belive theres no quests after that and you have nothing to do. At night its extermly dark and you can barley see ANYTHING! Theres a thing that says: Attention! This is an unfinished version of Riding Out.Instead it should say: Attention! This is the worst horse game ever.Maybe it will be better in the future, but for now, this is my reveiw."

Ive been looking for a horse game like this and I finally found it! I cant wait until this game is finished! One thing that bugs me about it though is I think they need to make it so the camera moves with the mouse when looking around. I shouldnt have to hold down my right mouse button just to look around me. It would really make it easier steering Thunder, (my horse). Its hard controling the camera and the horse at the same time. But god you guys keep up the hard work! This game has so much potential!"

76561198166606280,Recommended,461210,32342320,Posted: 11 June,all,Papyrus,Game is a bit confusing with the objective markers since it doesn't go away upon completing it and still stays and something that i miss in the settings is the resolution. But beside that the game is pretty nice with graphics for it's current development state.

And for the level of developement it's at, it's a good bit of fun. I can't wait to see where it goes, I just hope they continue to work on it! It has so much potential! If you've got a decent computer, the graphics are pretty and everything moves the way it should.Some of the tutorial is a little confusing... but it's a new game. I think it's a very cool idea that could turn into a seriously awesome game. Is it worth the money? I spose it depends on if you want to help fund the continuation of the game, because if you're not interested in collecting the horses and building things, you'll get bored pretty quick."

Needs a much better tutorial.  Also needs a better way to tell which way you need to go to find people in quests.  Graphics are good.  Would only recomend this game to people when it comes out of beta."
76561198097216079,Recommended,461210,35462001,Posted: 3 October,all,jesled1913,"Despite the fact that Riding Out is still an early access game, it has so much potential to be a fantastic game. However, it has many, many flaws. Some more serious than others.THE BAD:- The speech dialog looks terrible and the grammar is just ridiculously stupid. At some points it's difficult to actually understand or SEE the bloody words due to the dialog box being clear and showing the background of the game. For example, black writing doesn't mix well with a dark background.- It crashes CONSTANTLY, and in doing so, you lose your progress and have to start again, which is an arduous process.- The majority of the game controls are as if though you're attempting to understand ancient Egyptian symbols. Many make no sense whatsoever, and will make you checking back and forth to see how to do a certain action in the game.- Even on a high spec PC, it still crashes. No matter what you do, even if you change the graphics quality of the game it will still crash.- The storyline is absolute bullsh*t, it lacks direction and meaning. It feels as if though the only purpose and story in the game is to mine and sell. This 'aint Minecraft ya goofs.- The map has no distinct and obvious locations. Such as the town or the stables, you have to find them on your own with an ugly looking purple horseshoe that vaguely shows you where to go.- Trying to look for a certain person for a quest? Good luck, because the game will not tell you where they are, nor will said people spawn back at a specific location that you will remember and will trust that they will be there. It's a goddamn goose chase for hecks sake.- Is your horse stuck in a certain position and can't back up? Well too bad, because you can't back your horse up in the first place.- Have you lost your horse and can't find it no matter where you look? Once again, too bad. You can't call or whistle your horse to come to you. So that means you have to jog all the way back to the stables.- Riding in the dark or just jogging on foot? Have fun running into things that you can't see because NOTHING is lit up on paths outside of the town.- The English in the game is appalling. GAME MAKERS, GET SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ENGLISH.- Want to save your game so you don't lose progress? Too bad, you can't save at all.- Are you having a nice ride near some cliffs, but are worried about falling off? Don't worry your pretty little head because you and your horse can survive 200 metre falls without any damage! You and your horse cannot die. From a 200.metre.fall. Seriously?- Tying your horse up is pointless in the game, mainly because when you dismount and go anywhere, your horse stays right where you left it.- There is no tack for your horse. No bridles, saddles, saddle pads, stirrups, NOTHING.- You cannot change the appearance of your character.- There is not enough variety of things to do to be able to earn money. Mining and cutting trees down is all there is. It gets old and boring VERY quickly.I could go on forever about the flaws of this game. Yes it is still a beta game, and yes it does have so, so many problems, but it's time to list the GOOD things about it.THE GOOD:- There is only one other game like this, Star Stable, but it comes nowhere near the freedom and ability to create and explore your own world.- The graphics, despite being a beta game are beautiful.- You can build your own stables for god sake. How sweet is that?!- The horses are stunning and look fantastic, their coat colours have a huge range, and their movement is pretty good. Even when you aren't riding them, they have their own actions such as wandering around the stable or grazing on the grass.- You can enter almost every building, which are fully furnished and look fantastic.- You feel absolute freedom in the game. You can basically do anything or go anywhere.- There is endless opportunities for creative people to build things, which you can do anywhere in the game.- Your character's movement is excellent, and the controls for it are simple and easy to understand.- The characters look good, they have the same quality as your character.- The ability to open almost every door or gate makes the game feel more realistic.- Being able to pick up and move certain objects and place them anywhere is also quite emersive.There are a few more good things about this game, but these are the main ones that should be noted.In summary: If you like horses, buy the game. However, don't be surprised that it's not perfect in any way as it's a beta game. It has all the potential in the world to be a beautiful and fun game to play if you give the developers time to make it as such. Personally, I'm waiting with high expectations for the game to be fully completed."
