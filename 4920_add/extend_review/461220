Don't let the cutesy presentation fool you (though I personally happen to love it), this game has some great strategy, depth, and gameplay under the hood. Love the presentation -- both the unusual ""cyberpink"" vibe and the clever/funny dialogue and interactions. I'm still just digging into this, but I'm absolutely loving it so far. Highly recommended, especially if you dig puzzle and RPG combat elements but also are in the mood for something fresh and very unique."

Asides from the match-3 mechanic, this game is nothing like Bejeweled.3. It's match-3 plus grid-based tactic, plus a little JRPG, plus cutesy graphic.4. Oh and did I mention boss fights? Its boss fights are one of a kind,5. I've only just beaten OWLNET ( 4th stage ) so far, but the level design really made me go through every single corner of the areas and grind the items I need in order to ( successfully ) beat the end-boss.6. That feeling when you finally did it after 10+ rounds, is just like when you beaten a Dark Souls boss where, they didn't make it intentionally hard, but you can beat it if you know exactly what you're doing.7. My only complain was that it didn't have controller support."
,Recommended,461220,29200744,Posted: 12 January,all,Akio,"At first glance Beglitched looks like a simple match-3 game with colorful visuals and cutesy sprites, when in fact, is so much more than that.Beglitched is a puzzle game where you play as the ""stranger"" who found the ""Glitch Witch's"" Laptop from a super sekrit hiding place. Congrats. Now you start your adventure by taking the place of the Glitch Witch to bomb hackers, fix forums, run away from dogs and deliver cat pictures, all while learning the secrets of the Glitch Witch in the process.The ""how to play the game"" is simple.You travel around computer networks to dig up for items/rabbits/coins, Minesweeper style.Battle Mechanic(Match-3):Activate Computer nodes to find the enemy location. Then blow up the enemy with a bomb.Sounds easy right?Now comes in the Energy and Cycle Management.Each time you move a tile or activate a node/bomb, you consume 1 cycle.When activating nodes or triggering a bomb, you spend energy.You lose health when you activated a node with the enemy inside it or when everytime the cycle ends.I won't go in-depth on this because all these are demonstrated/stated in the tutorial.All of these become more complex through the course of the game. Complex Puzzles that really make you think. You'll encounter enemies immune to bombs, glitchy computer networks that doesn't seem to have any entry/exit. A bit frustrating at times, but very satisfying when you solve the puzzles, which, I think, is how puzzle games should be.Another thing worth the praise are the Glitch Witch's secret notes. It tells you how the Glitch Witch spends her free time. From being fascinated from the flushing sound of the toilet, to her opinions about lies in life. This gets you immersed in the story and wonders who the Glitch Witch is, which motivates you to try and attempt to uncover where the Glitch Witch is, and why did she give her job to someone else.Overall, this is an excellent puzzle game.Low Replayability. Good soundtracks. Cutesy Visuals.One of the indie games that, for me, feels ""fresh"".Recommended to anyone who likes puzzles or just plain want to try something new. Give it a try."
,Recommended,461220,25971720,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Sean Han Tani,"I'm giving this more of a mixed-to-positive recommend.Writing this at about 4-5 hours in. I like the dense-ness of the ideas: most battles and stages don't feel wasted, there's a bunch of neat twists and small additions to the gameplay with each level. The interface for the level select is neat, as is the ways in which the overworld and in-battle statuses interact. Graphics are clear and mostly understandable, there's a lot of nice graphical polish all over the place here.That being said, I don't find the handling of difficulty scaling to work particularly well: some levels are fairly unforgiving - think a one-life Mega Man stage, which will completely restart you even if you're 20-30 minutes in and die. It does not help that sometimes new ideas are introduced at the end of stages, giving you one chance to mess up before losing all of your progress. Some of the ideas in the later levels felt obtuse in their more difficult iterations (SquidNet and Egg(?)Net come to mind) - I wasn't sure whether I was winning by luck or not.I think checkpoints or even mid-stage saves could have helped a lot in this respect: the game seems to be turning into more about learning about these neat tricks and using them, but the context in which they pop up is extremely stressful and so I think that diminishes the game in that respect.Being able to mark nodes on the maps (not the battle screen) would have been very nice: I think you're really at a disadvantage with this game if you're unable to store a lot of visual information in your head.Battles become stressful at times because of the aforementioned, the music can become grating at these moments (though for the most part it's fitting).I can't help but wonder if a keyboard interface for the game would have worked - I find myself wishing I could navigate level selects and battles by using keys rather than having to mouse and click all the time, and it got annoying when replaying stages to have to keep clicking for dialogue to pass."

Sometimes it can be frustrating because if you run out of health you have to start the level over entirely (which leads to doing a lot of the same battles over and over again). I'd enjoy an easy mode to just be able to appreciate the storyline more, but that's really a testament to what a cute world they've created here! Overall, the unique style and playfulness far outweighs the occasional frustration, and I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a quirky little puzzle game."

Giving it a positive review only because most people are probably better at this type of game than I am.I love basically everything about this game. The match-3 is great and for some reason I enjoyed the total confusion at the beginning. It makes sense in terms of the ""backstory"", if you can call it that. The aesthetic is amazing and the soudtrack is amazing. The retro sound effects are great too.However, I feel like I'm too dumb to play this game. While I love match-3 I'm not good at the ones where you actually have to think ahead about things. The soundtrack doesn't make me want to be contemplative and strategic, it makes me want to match quickly without planning. I'm stuck on OwlNet, CatNet, and SpamNet all at the same time. I think for each I was able to get to what felt like a ""final boss"" at least once, but I'd have such low health or my cats would be at the bottom of the board. Then I inevitably die after spending ten-fifteen minutes getting through the level. I've gone through all three of those levels at least six times each and it's insanely frustrating to start over. Especially the cats, who thought of that hell? How are you supposed to keep them from being matched when the pieces on the board generally MOVE DOWNWARD NO MATTER WHAT and you get an enemy that moves them together? I spent every fight just moving the cats away so they don't get matched, and then the enemy moves it straight back. Then we do this over and over again until I run out of health.I can recommend if you are not an idiot like I am. I can also recommend if you want to feel bad about yourself (in a good way). I wish the game gave some tips about how to ""plan out"" your board so that it wouldn't feel like I'm missing something here. I don't feel like I can get better at this game, because so many elements of match-3 are essentially random. So, I don't think I'll play this again but it's a cheap game and worth the experience. Probably."

76561198050602761,Not Recommended,461220,34010702,Posted: 4 August,all,Cattaneo,"I'm rather saddened by this review. I wanted to enjoy Beglitched, I really did, it's a cutesy game with a lot of heart and passion in it, and the design is clever. Unfortunately, the game makes some really inexplicable missteps which kill it. First and foremost, which had this not been around, could have forgiven everything else. When you die, you are sent back to the beginning of the ""dungeon"" which might not seem like much, but the combat of the game really isn't strong enough to support doing the same area with the same gimmick over and over. This leads into another issue, the game has really odd difficulty spikes. The one that caught me and sent me into a frenzy is the cat zone which has instant kill failure states which are incredibly easy to cause, so you'll likely be stuck doing that one over and over until your hair goes grey from the stress. It doesn't help that the game never really explains anything, which some may write off as me being a tutorial baby, but honestly, the game explains literally nothing, even the store page doesn't really tell you what the game is. I dunno, if they make some changes maybe it'll be worth picking up, but for now, it's just too frustrating to recommend."

You do have to replay certain portions multiple times to complete a section, but it's somewhat randomized, so it's not the exact same thing. Also I feel like there's a good amount of depth to the game, so you can try multiple different strategies for completing an area, so it hasn't gotten boring or overly frustrating to me. Overall I think it's great if you like puzzle games or roguelike-type games.After finishing it, I still felt like I really enjoyed it. There were a few touches that gave it more of a personal feel in a way that provided an interesting contrast to the rest of the game. The only thing I felt iffy about is that for one of the bosses it really just felt like I was just lucky and there wasn't a clear strategy to beat it, but maybe i just missed it."

,Recommended,461220,29317083,Posted: 17 January,all,Merlandese,"Beglitched is a genuine point of interest in how it manages its systems.It's a puzzle game about being a hacker, but not in a complex web of newfangled problems. Instead it mixes the logic and feel of old computer games, ones you might find on Windows 95 or in the GAMES section of a Nokia. And that's where it's at its most clever. It borrows without shame, without trickery, in such a way that forms together into one much larger puzzle.WORLD MAP = Windows DesktopDUNGEON MAP = Minesweeper + Dungeon CrawlerBATTLE = Bejeweled + Hide & Seek + Resource ManagementOne warning I should get out of the way is perception. What you might feel in the first parts of the game are misleading.Beglitched has ""dungeons"" that you ""crawl' through and fight of enemies. This feels like a sort of RPG, or Dungeon Crawler. When you complete the first fight, you think you'll level up, or get a health upgrade. When you get money, you think you can buy better Skills or Permanent Upgrades. When you die you wonder if it's possible to grind.But no. Get that out of your head right now. This is a puzzle game.Every ""dungeon"" is like a level of Mario or Portal. You get better by playing, not by grinding enemies into statistics.Each dungeon has its own logic. It demands you move and fight in different ways. This is for you to solve. This is where the joy comes from. But you have to fight an urge. You have to realize that attacking an enemy isn't usually the best solution. More often than not, the puzzle is how to AVOID enemy encounters. And when you fight, the puzzle isn't always about winning. Rather, it's about minimizing long-term damage, analyzing how enemies work in that area, and setting up your grid for the next fight if you have to fight it.The systems explain themselves. Solving how they can be worked around, however, is the fun.And it's very nice fun. It's light fun. And none of the puzzle outstay their welcome. The concepts used in the SPAM level and the concepts in the CAT level are very different, barely ever bleeding over.You're given a toolbox of ideas, and each level crafts a way to make you exploit that toolbox differently.If any of this sounds like your bag of tea, get it! Support these guys! It's a good experience, and worth supporting the devs."

I know it might seem from previews like its just another match-3 game, but dont be fooled!

It's almost too clever, asking the player to think outside the box and grasp onto new concepts at a fairly speedy pace. It's almost too cute, giving you a pink laptop, cartoon avis with puns, and a match-3 puzzler that is anything but casual.It's a high-concept cocktail of genres, that doesnn't bother to explain, or answer for the flavors. Beglitched all takes place on the pink computer I just mentioned, given to you, your character, by a talented, precocious - maybe genius - hacker who left a long shadow. You are exploring it because you were entrusted to it, and it should be fun. It has two interfaces, one a Bejeweled-like ""fight,"" where you have to use one of several pieces to track down how far, and in what direction a certain enemy is hiding, before you blow them up. Outside of battle, you are a cat avi, traveling through a varying grid of computer screens which you can dive in, digging into more. This is the ""adventure"" mode aspect, where you get from one point to another over a longer period of time, with battles intermittently. It plays like Minesweeper, where spoils of certain computer screens are only revealed by their neighbors, so you deduce the ""mines"" from the desirables. Once you dive into a screen to the next level, it blurs and makes a quick ""dial-up"" sound. Which never gets old.On a third, ""menu"" screen, you are simply clicking icons on Glitch Witch's desktop to travel into her files, where you can read her poetry and journal entries, or travel through a lost woods of folders that reset once you hit a wrong ""turn."" It has a voyeuristic thrill, except of course Glitch Witch always feels one step ahead of your nameless protagonist.All this minesweeping and Bejewling is a metaphor, for something that goes over my head, but never bores with its ambient buzz. You meet other hackers, other speaking animals who are all happy to see the ""Glitch Witch"" again. Based on her old ""forum"" buddies, you can start to build a portrait of what kind of person she was, an early ♥♥♥♥♥ type who had experiments and potential with trickster trolls, fortune hunters, and others who didn't develop the sense of responsibility with their skills. I love these characters, and the lonely environment that drew the enterprising souls together is a classic story the old internet days. Their fate puts this in the leagues of great short stories, profiting off every minute, and compensating every frame.Eventually, after a difficulty curve, the new mechanics in each level are also explained in journal pieces as metaphors for what she was thinking when she created certain programs, or possibly even ""spells."" The ""glitch"" part is taken to the extreme as outside of the box thinking forces you to push the limits of what is given to you on the screen. Also, probably a metaphor, of course.The tutorial is left out: it assumes the player can pick up how to play. This may rankle some, but please others, who don't like to be pulled down by tutorials. I didn't have a problem, because I like to get my hands dirty first; the game doesn't punish you for failing until after you've grasped the concept. Unfortunately, I didn't catch on to the story elements until it was past time to reflect on the first half of the game, so I may go back to clear things up. The ending, however challenging, still teases that I haven't completed the game, and there is a techno hole in the pink laptop that I still can only speculate about, like he playfully cryptic journal entries.Beglitched is completely emblematic of our times. It's a computer within a computer, to show how some people lived online, even before the dawn of social media. As a cultural artifcact, younger players may come to understand better the life of a nerdy person maybe in the 90's or mid 2000's. One can hope that her friends don't dwell on that nostalgia, though; that our contemporary ghoulies of irony and elitism will join Glitch Witch in more productive ventures."

She has left a file for you describing her situation and that you must take her place for a little while. Simple and cute.The gameplay, though it is looks simple, is not. At the beginning, the instructions you recieve are very vauge and hard to understand. There is no ongoing help when you start to encounter new mechanics. I was stuck very early on, and despite trying to look things up to help me, I couldn't pass the area. Its just too complicated in proportion to the help, or lack thereof, you recieve.I would give it a 2/5. It looks pretty, has a cutsey story, but is very difficult to play and makes it not fun.

Instead, it turned out to be a very original, cute, and challenging puzzle game.That said, it has been unforgiving. You are specifically not told how the mechanics work in the battles or in the overworld (or when you are it done so cryptically), so just figuring out how to play is a puzzle. For example, how are you supposed to know what it means to ""glitch"" something? I think this helps with ""immersion,"" adding to the mystery. Once you get the hang of that, you are still at the mercy of difficult fights and RNG, and losing means you have to start the level from the beginning. As frustrating as this was, the game often gave me multiple levels to try at once, so I could cool off on the others before trying the difficult one again. As you can see, I believe the unforgiving parts of this game are handled well.In fact, I am glad the game wasn't a cakewalk or it would have been too short. Other great things about it include the soundtrack, the humor, the story, and the characters. I could write a lot about each. But my favorite part of the game was the evolving gameplay. The basic mechanics of maneuvering the overworld and battling do not become tired and repetitive because the rules get flipped on you with almost every screen. These changing rules are the puzzles you have to solve, and they are clever and push the game to the limit. I was especially impressed at the use of a 'program' item you receive at the beginning of the game that I thought would be obsolete by the end, but was actually integrated very well into MULTIPLE later puzzles!My only complaint is that there is a portion of the map in theforumsthat I never get to enter, even after beating the game. This, along with theunopened zipper files, made me hope for postgame content, but there wasn't any.Amazing little game. Low replayability, so I recommend getting it on sale, but if you like puzzles, play it!"
,Recommended,461220,29512184,Posted: 26 January,all,Ruthie Pee,"Beglitched is a lovely puzzle game that goes far beyond its cute pixel graphics. On the surface, it looks like a match-3 but past the colorful, falling tiles there is so much more depth. Different blocks give you different types of intel on which tile an enemy is hiding in, essentially. The overworld is a puzzle in and of itself too, which I don't think has been done before. Another reviewer compared Beglitched to Battleship, which is kind of leaning the right direction, but it's about 8 times more complex, something more akin to chess. It is devastatingly hard if you're not patient, a game reminiscent of the old days of puzzle games. Nowadays, puzzle games reward you with heaps of coins and points for doing absolutely nothing. This game offers a challenge, and I really am enjoying it so far (about 3 hours in and I've done the first 3 parts)."

The videos suggest it's just another cutesy match-3 puzzle battle game, albeit one with plot, but it's really much more like a traditional adventure game where instead of verbs and objects, you're solving puzzles through the interface of a match-3 puzzle battler (and minesweeper) game. It's impressive the number of puzzles they've managed to squeeze out of this constraint, and produces a romp that feels constantly fresh and clever. Like traditional adventure games though, much of the playtime is dependent on how fast you can solve the puzzles (which do get fairly obtuse), and in some cases having the board of the match-3 battles work against you even though you know what needs to be done can be frustrating (Tip: do spamnet before catnet). All in all though, a fun and thoughtful crossover game that illustrates the case for having an indie scene in gaming producing original new ideas."

While it uses Match-3 mechanics... kind of, it's put together into its own unique battle system, even putting together multiple unique boss battles in addition to ""puzzle bosses"".While it's rather straightforward in the earlier parts, mostly testing your skill with the Match-3 mechanics, later stages tend towards more puzzle bosses and requiring you to figure thinsg out.Those parts take after games like Myst or Antichamber though, giving little help and often leaving you to figure things out for yourself -- and if you can't figure something out, you get stuck. The game tries to give you indirect hints, but never outright states anything in those sections. If you don't like puzzler games like that, this probably isn't the game for you. You'll get... decently far, but you won't be finishing it.Also, it has cats. :D"
,Recommended,461220,28967357,Posted: 2 January,all,nifboy,"While Beglitched is definitely a puzzle game, I have a hard time thinking of it as a match-3 game at its core. The core game is much more about ""solving"" an encounter by defeating your enemy in the least moves possible, and having a lot of information-gathering tools to do so. The match-3 mechanic is mostly a means to move pieces around on the board.If that sounds like your jam, highly recommended."

The game mechanics are well thought, it looks cute, the sound is excellent, the little poems in game are quite fascinating.Sadly, it has a real ballancing issue, that makes some levels hard to the point of making me want to quit.I came back multiple times, because the game is very good, and I still recommand it, but I wish it didn't have this flaw."

A cute look and feel, and a mixture of gameplay mechanics that I've never seen before, all wrapped up in a slowly expanding story. Refreshing game for sure, really enjoying it!"

Building ephemeral communities, changing identities, leaving friendships and forums in our wake.It's just the sweetest thing."

It's not Bejeweled.If you like indie adventure games, you'll like this gameVery fun experience so far, and shockingly difficult in a way that doesn't feel like manipulating randomness. Lots of dynamic elements and interesting challenges. Well written, light hearted, and enough challenge and unique game elements to keep your attention. Almost 8 hours in, and I just got to the second half of the game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle/adventure/turn-based strategy games.Although it doesn't look like an adventure game or turn-based strategy game, it feels like a game closer in spirit to those than Bejeweled. These guys deserve attention for this."

Oh, but the gameplay, yeah it's hard as hell, even at the beginning. This is not bejeweled, I don't know what this monster is, but it kicks my♥♥♥♥♥ A lot. So yeah, you match things, you're limited by 'cycles','battery' and your HP. So a lot of crap to keep track of.  The critters all have their own special perks, such as moving a random direction every turn, and probably more difficult nonsense as the game goes on. By the way you can't really see them as you play, you better have a lot of compasses or some good luck. It's fun. If it isn't to you then this just isn't your kind of game or your kind of cute. I assume this game targets a very niche audience. If nothing in the video impresses you, don't bother buying. Otherwise, to my niche bretheren: Well you've probably bought it already haven't you?"
