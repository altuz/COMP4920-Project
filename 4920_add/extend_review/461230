,Recommended,461230,32143719,Posted: 2 June,all,Voxsteller,"PROS- First off, the gameplay is fun and addicting with unique ideas and many levels to choose from including several endless wave styled levels that helps add replay value.- Grants the option to change some in game textures to be suitable with the player along with many icons for the player to choose from. Icon customization boundaries will also be expanded upon with the extensions of a icon creator in the near future which I and many others are guarenteed to look foward to.- Level editor with customizables to choose from including some that aren't in offical levels such as hazards, blocks, and scenery.- Great choice in music that syncs with the level and game.CONS- The big elephant in the room when it comes to problems in this game are the bugs. There are many bugs within the game especailly within the game's level editor ranging from bugs that mess up music lines to some objects such as speed boosters and teleporters not working randomly. Hopefully these bugs will be fixed in future updates.- Some of the graphics look a bit odd and hard to dechiper what is what. Pixel graphics are highly appreciated, but some textures, especailly the difficulty faces could be improved on.- Some mechanics/textures are only used in one level and some of the offical levels feel too different from the others appearence wise. Examples include Viper, Stero Madness 2, Momentum, and Time Lapse.OVERALL- I would give this game a 4/5. This game has fun gameplay keeping the player engaged when they mess up and try to improve on what they messed up. There is also a lot of replay value with many unlockables, wave modes, and custom levels, but is very buggy for a game that is currently in its 2.04 state."

,Not Recommended,461230,33007592,Posted: 29 June,all,Gureato Potato,"Clearly made by someone that is a great fan of Geometry Dash and is trying to ride off of its success yet trying to make it seem different. This however works against it making it impossible to actually practise an of the harder levels as the practice mode is just noclip and doesn't let you try any of the parts you find hard. The screen also shakes way to much so not only can you not see what is going on it's almost impossible to find out as the game doesn't have a functioning practice mode.Overall, while the game uses some great music (taken from newgrounds) nothing else really shines through. The gameplay tries way too hard to be like Geometry Dash yet something different creating a large mess. The game also just has a bunch of youtubers you might know of if you are a part of the geometry dash community as they are famous for just that game.ConclusionThe only redeeming quality about this game is it's music which you can listen to (for free) on Newgrounds, the rest is clearly just trying to bait geometry dash players into buying something that looks similar and has similar themes to geometry dash."

The click detection on the batteries makes the harder levels almost impossible because of the ""precise"" clicking on it.2. When I start up the game most of the time it just shows a pure white screen and plays the menu music, you can still click on things but you can't see what you are clicking.Other than those 2 game breaking things, it is phenomenal. I can't wait what comes in the future, and keep it up! Please fix these 2 bugs though, they are extremely annoying."
