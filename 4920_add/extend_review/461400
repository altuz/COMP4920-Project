They have a new game on Greenlight - please vote against it being greenlit, they just reskin the same game and sell it as new:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885680708Massive is a scam. Besides being a horrible knock off of Nuclear Throne, it's the same exact game as Gun Brothers... check it out for yourself and you tell me otherwise.http://store.steampowered.com/app/514410/Hell even the sale page is identical right down to the layout of the graphics, and that pruple skull enemy thing... it's just slightly altered on one. xDThey're developping 1 game under 2 different titles and publisher/developer names. One game is also slightly reskinned... It saddens me to see people getting ripped off. Selling the same reskinned game while it is still in development - twice, is seriously an insult! Maybe even fraudulent.MassiveDeveloper: Massive GamePublisher: Massive GameGun BrothersDeveloper: GameDevComPublisher: GameDevComDoes that not sound deceitful?Also note that as of this review update, both Massive and Gun Brothers are still currently in early access and if Steam is going to continue to sell both, I would only hope that the differences in both final products (as well as needed fixes) justify a $9.99 x2 price point (though by the looks of it, I highly doubt it).NOTE: A great part of this review is copy/paste fromHERE, I only somewhat changed it to match my views."
,Not Recommended,461400,30352496,Posted: 6 March,all,PuddingSkin,TL;DR They are stealing your money. Literally.This is the lowest of the low type of scammer. They are selling the same game twice. See Gun Brothers. Almost everything is the exact same. This is a prime example of a company taking advantage of steams early access. The only reason I bought this game is because I love Nuclear Throne AND because I found out that it was on sale with the ost for $1 instead of the $9.99. I already regret it though seeing as how I can't even pick up 80% of the items on the ground because its absolutely broken.

76561198037197299,Not Recommended,461400,29749213,Posted: 6 February,all,Orb87Bro,2d shooter game with a retro touch in it. Tries to be a rogue lite game but fails to be one. Some enemies look like they are your allies and most of them do the same.Controls are meh. The only thing i like about this game is the destructible walls that gives some strategy to the game.

(No pun intended...lol) Good, quick action that keeps you on your toes...and it's fun! Good for short-term and long-term play too...whichever sets the mood. Definitely recommend, and there's frequent updates and GREAT developer who is awesome at communicating, as well as being very attentive to player comments. PLUS, there's a group for the game, where you really get great insight into what the developer is aiming for (no pun intended...lol) in updates and player needs. Totally can't miss (Again, no pun intended...lol) with 'Massive' on every level!!"

But the game is well made and im proud to support the Devs on Massive and i hope you are too!

,Recommended,461400,35132140,Posted: 22 September,all,cagnes06,"Very first contact is VERY good. Does not look as a scam, as announced. EASY mode, unlimited lives, unlimited bullets ! Great art. And XBOX 360 controller works !!! Don't want to troll, but for me this is as fun as Nuclear Throne. I keep this game and will explore further.Edit 23/09/2107I made it through level 6-1 in easy mode (immortal).My 2 cents:First off, THANK YOU SO MUCH to consider the stupid players like me, highly UNskilled, with the immortal mode. So few games with VERY easy modes !!! Butcher has an easy mode DLC. But so many remain for the elite or the super top skilled gamers: Enter the Gungon, Nuclear Throne, even UltraGoodness is hard. After 8 hours of work, tired, I still can enjoy killing monsters. And practice ... to slowly improve ?! I returned Enter the Gungeon within minutes... Nuclear Throne is hard but practicable. Massive is very great for me. After playing Massive, I will miss the feature in NT.MASSIVE is NOT a clone of NT, there are very good ideas, specific to this game.My two cents about the +++ and the suggestions ???:+ destructible environments are great; allow to take shortcuts and can be part of the strategy+ shields in steel, excellent idea+ configurable difficulty: thank you again+ monsters are great, so as existing guns+ frame rate is OK+ pixel art is fine+ the map (bottom right) is great? ""level of zoom"" for me is a little too excessive: one can see well the character but not enough of the global scene. Other games have the opposite drawback (character is too tiny). So for now the scenery is pretty OK, but slightly ""higher"" would be better imho? first levels are little too dark to be readable. Level 5 is very readable for example.? no levels after 6-1 ?? more guns please (the existing ones are great): laser, lasso, grenades, blast, invisibility shield, etc? monsters with seeable movements are disturbing (for me); others are fine. The now standard idea of a big monster destroyed which leads to several tiny monsters ?? destructible environments, along NON-destructible environments and steel shields (movable, excellent ! or NON-moveable) could be a FANTASTIC part of the strategy. For now, empty spaces imply fragility (hiding and unveiling is a great part of the pleasure in such games). I realize that this is absent from NT (as far as I know, but again I have little experience).? in the map, sometimes ennemies are now shown? intermediate state between ""immortal"" and ""easy"": stay immortal but indicate when character is supposed to be dead so that I can improve while continuing to play (well ... there's a counter no?)As a very superficial conclusion I would say that this game is great to practice and to avoid despair found in Nuclear Throne. Probably an intermediate space in between NT and Massive is to be taken. I doubt Vlambeer will accept to consider very casual gamers like me, so my last hope is that you developers of Massive can try to leverage the differences (e.g. destructible environments with non-destructible and/or moveable parts; funny guns; considerations for beginners; randomized maps)Thank you again and keep going ! Please pursue your efforts !Best regardsedit 30/09parametric difficultyhello. the discussion about (the number of) traps makes me think about ""parametrization"" of the game. since levels are procedurally generated why not give the hand to the player ? my own blocker is difficulty setting and i am so poorly skilled that i need a very easy mode. yet the choices in difficulty are brutal, in that no subtleties can be brought.if the user can choose in settings the number of traps (or a range thereof), the level of power of guns, if environment is destructible or not, to what extent (cursors), etc it could be a huge differenciator versus other similar games. possible variables: number and power of ennemies, number and power of guns, surface of map, complxity of level, number of traps, speed, ...do not know at which point it is feasable to ""open"" access to such variables in the code base. but the promise could be that the mix of the game could be personalized to player's taste.yes some combinations may not work but it is an appeal to play with game some more ;o)the more i think of it... it a sign of respect to the user to offer configurable gameplay, let alone of considering difficulty"

Doesn't recognize my Xbox controller even though the options lists a controller and shows all of the button mappings for it.  When you pause the game none of in game menu options work except ""Continue"". If you click ""Quit"" it just closes the menu and unpauses the game??? The UI is confusing.  The quality of this game is Pre-Alpha at best, I will be seeking a refund."
