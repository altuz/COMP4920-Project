76561197963489560,Recommended,461410,24194326,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Johnny Poopsock,"It's still pretty early, rough around the edges, and still a bit crash-y at times, but as a Vive owner, this game is *exactly* the sort of thing I've been waiting and hoping for years for!If haven't played enough 'artificial motion' VR games to get your VR legs yet, you'll need to stick with the teleportation movement option, at least to start. If you don't have your VR legs (think 'sea legs'), the standard movement option *will* make you feel nauseous - at least on your first few plays. The solution to that is to take off the VR headset as soon as you start to feel nausea, and take a break until it passes, then get back into the game afterward. You can build up a tollerance and get your VR legs pretty quickly that way.Once you've got your VR legs though, this game is a friggin' pioneer of *hell-yea*! You can use standard FPS movement to move around the arenas, while still using your real body to aim your weapon, hide, or duck for cover. The game also has an option to allow for jumping and grappling hook movement in VR, which does *awesome* things for combat when your stomach is ready to handle it.I hope-hope-hope that more people pick up this game and work their way up to being able to handle the awesome-magic of controller-based-movement in VR because it is *awesome* and opens up some *amazing* possibilities for VR gaming (for those who learn to handle it).For now though, you can populate matches with bots if you can't find others to play with, which is pretty enjoyable on it's own, IMO."

76561197990270671,Recommended,461410,24167270,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,flibbertigibbety,"Protonwar has a lot of features that no other Vive game currently has. Free movement that's not tied to the touchpad (using left controller to move directionally), giving the ""run and gun"" movement much more of a natural and intuitive feeling than it's touchpad counterpart. The game has a variety of weapons to use, all of which perform differently. There are not a ton of levels at the moment, but the provided 4 levels are plenty to keep you occupied being that it's just days into it's EA release. Vive also has a ""wave"" based coop shooter mode that can be fun (though it's currently in a testing phase and is pretty buggy). The multiplayer also supports bots, so getting populated games when there are only a couple players is plenty easy. Currently, Vive standing mode supports death match and team death match. Developer has stated that there are many more game modes to come.There are certainly some bugs and non-refined features here and there, but no more than what you'd expect from EA. The developer is also very quick to take customer input regarding VR immersion and is quick to try different things and even provide ""test builds"" for those who want to try out experimental features. With that level of involvement, I see this game getting quite big and a whole lot of fun.I have not referenced anything ""steated"" related, as I have no interest in playing the seated game play modes... although the vive should support it when using a mouse/kb."

The graphics look very crisp and detailed and really shows off the engine.The there are many options for movement as of January 2017, to include the ability to swivel left or right, just like in Serious Sam 1st Encounter.For anyone who loves arcade style FPS, this is going to be a must buy. I can't wait to see it finished. At the moment it's still in Alpha."

All locomotion options work together to give you the best movement strategies rather than choosing one over the other.  A must-buy recommendation that's a great alternative from the typical multiplayer combat military style shooters.Once custom maps becomes an option and someone releases Blood Gulch, and if it had vehicle options, good-bye real world, my dreams have come true."

76561197968638558,Recommended,461410,32024514,Posted: 28 May,all,Colin,"I think this game has the potential to be THE unreal tournament/Quake style game of VR. Potential is important here. Its good now, very good, and everything is polished, levels, lighting, movement etc. There are some bugs/glitches to be expected in an EA game I guess. It can detract from playing the game, but for the money its about right and I suggest buying it to help the developers, create more online users to play against, have fun, and develop that vr stomach you will want in order to play this more and more. It also features single player and LAN mode whihc could be great for the future when more people have VR and arcades of course. To me, it feels one of the quickest, cleanest, most polished FPS multiplayer online game in VR right now."

This is the kind of gameplay style that is needed to fill the old-school competitive shooter hole in VR gaming (think Quake and UT). My impression is it is inredibly good casual (or competitive) fastpaced fun. The envirnonments are beautiful, framerate is great (caveat, see below) and the variety of guns are fun to shoot. I have yet to play a match without bots.Note that when playing with bots, I noticed performance decreasing over time  throughout the game (framerate drop, latency increase). This could only be fixed by restarting the match."

76561198002049680,Recommended,461410,34205275,Posted: 12 August,all,Dimvision,"An excellent game well worth the asking price if you enjoy quake-like FPS arena shooters. I'm not really into the CS:GO style VR games out right now, but when I tried this out I felt it was exactly what I was looking for: fast-paced, able to leap large distances, on the fly weapon upgrades, and in-and-out 10 minute arena matches. The shooting is accurate in VR, the graphics are good, and it has a great feel to it when you're running and jumping around shooting others, The bots are good enough to play with, but what is seriously lacking is a playerbase, though I have encountered other players a couple of times. The bots fill the gap between games with others, but this game will really take off once the playerbase picks up. Bonus points for an active dev and an actually updating EA game. Highly recommended fast-paced FPS with the hopes that the more people pick this up and get into it, the better it'll be for everyone."

And since this game is licensed for arcades through steam - I would not risk any of my customers trying, since being sick is surely going to make them never go back to vr.Please make an option with 3-4 second teleport recharge and no other ,,controller based'' option to ensure people do not get sick. For those who are happy with other way - by all means leave them available. You can even make dedicated servers for those happy only with teleport.As it is , I cannot let my customer play this game, despite buying 2. I would buy 2 more a minute those changes are implemented as I think - this game is a winner."

Remember when you were young and played UT with InstaGib? You can do that here, but this time in VR!It is fast paced with alot of different game modes.The reason i dont have more playtime is because what others have pointed out... Empty servers!I hope it gets as much attention eventually as Onward or Pavlov does. Cuz this game deserves it!"

This game runs perfectly other then the one or two connection issues to server but this may be due to my internet connection.I then decided to buy the full version, I have tried for three days none stop and cant find any game with other players, I never had this issue with the demo. Does the full version sync with the demo level and players on the demo?I tried out the bots, they are way to easy to kill, I can get a good 50 kills on no deaths.About half a second away from wanting a refund due to no other player on line at all and I bought this game for the muiltiplayer, not single player."

Even if it means those who teleport would not be allowed on some public games - I am fine with it, we will setup our own games, for vr sissies."

76561198056644824,Recommended,461410,35356882,Posted: 30 September,all,Humpty Dance,I think that this game is pretty and has a lot of potential. The only downside is that it needs players. So if you're on the fence about getting this game my recommendation is to buy it. This game has to succeed. It's freeking Unreal Tournament in V.R.  What more could you want???? TF2 of course but I'll settle for Unreal for now.
