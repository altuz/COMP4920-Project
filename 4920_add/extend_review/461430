Updates every few days, a very active and responsive dev, and a dev that goes out into the field and does his homework. My advice to folks would be: Get the game, join a community, learn how to play it properly and enjoy the immersion. This is very early access, the game is only gonna get better - Rough edges are to be expected on a game of this scale. Remember, it is early access, nobody on Steam is new to that concept."

They have done well for a two-man team who often have to hire free-lancers for advanced things and that. Sure it has it's bugs, but the dev team appear committed and from the short time I've played, have done an awesome job! Can't wait for third person and putting out fires!"

The game is still very very early and there are notable bugs such as having to wait about 2-5 mins after loading in for a black screen. Settings as well dont like to save. However the gameplay mechanic is awesome, the physics are awesome and the lighting and sirens are great! I cant wait for the finished version of this game and im glad I supported it before the price drop!"

Before you buy it right now, as it stands, please note somethings....#1: The third person was just released so they're working out the bugs. But it is looking great.#2: You cant put out fires yet.#3:  This isnt a finished game, so dont excpect it to play like one.#4: Read the description and what the players say about it first. Dont just buy the game and then complain and give it a bad review because you didnt read the description first.#5: They're not sure if they are going to make it for consoles yet. If they do, it wont be for a long time. So please stop asking over and over again.#6: They are optimizing the game constantly. Its running smoother on every update. Please check the specs first.#7: The developers are very responsive to concerns and bugs. Just let them know in a mature way. ""This game sucks!"" doesnt really help them.#8: This is a very small development team. Just understand that they have lives too. If they have something go wrong in their personal life, give them a chance to work it out. I want this game done as much as the next guy but I understand that crap happens. They are still able to come out with patches and updates alot faster than bigger companies.#9: Watch some of their live streams. It'll give you a good idea of what they do everyday.#10:  The police and EMS are development is a little behind from the Fire development. They cant do everything at once."

I understand it's a Pre-Alpha, however, it still should not be on the steam store until you can actually do something worthwhile in the game. All you can do in this game is drive the vehicles. Nothing more. Cannot put out fires, handle accidents, pull people over or anything. It's a driving simulator at this point.. I understand the devs need money to help make the game, but if this is where the money has gone so far, i'm scared to see how it will look when it is done.HOWEVER...The dev team is hard at work and is working tirelessly to make this game a good game. Right now all you can do in it at this point is literally drive to the scene of a fire, look at it, then call 10-8 (back in service) and the fire goes away. That is all you can do right now.If you want a first responder game, download 911 first responders and get the LA or NY mod for it. This game needs probably another good year of work before it should even be sold anywhere near $35. Right now, its worth about $10 at the most.Do not get me wrong, I really hope this game becomes something awesome. But right now its in such a pre-alpha phase, its not worth sinking $35 into a game that may never finish, you never know. But from what the Devs have proven so far, they're committed to make this game great. Check back in 3-6 months to see what the Devs have done. Then go from there, but as it stands right now, do not risk your money.EDITSeptember 27th 2017Since I bought this game a few months ago. It has only been updated once.. The Dev team seems more interested in putting in multiplayer than actually adding something in the game that you can do. What is the point of having multiplayer if you can't do anything in it?The game has made very little to no progress, and the devs keep making excuses.I would stay away, the devs haven't really done anything worth while in a few months now."

It was impossible to get one to be compatiable with GTA IV. When this game came out, I thought to give it a try. This game is AMAZING. Engine Co. 49 and Rescue 9 FDNY trucks has a realistic, fully mechanical Q2-B! Fires have simulated backdraft's and flashovers.

I bought this game as soon as it came out.  I was going to wait until the game was complete, but I feel that these guys deserve a great review for the work they have put in.  You all have worked your asses off to give us a great game.  Thank you for that.  So here is what I think of the quality of certain aspects of the game:Vehicles: 9/10 (Police cars and ambulances still need work)Map: 9/10 (Not fully complete yet, but more buildings constantly being added!)Optimization: 5/10 (Laggy, especially if you use a low end PC/laptop)Multiplayer: 7/10 (Fun to roleplay with friends, but not much to do at this point...)Gameplay: 7/10 (Calls are fun to respond to, but you get on scene and all you can do is stay there until the call ends.)Audio: 10/10 (Engine sounds are great, multiple manual sirens really bring it home...)Game Potential: 1000/10 (So much untapped potential waiting to be found and put out later in development!)Overall: 8/10 (Just a fantastic game!  Even though not complete, very fun to drive around NY in your fire engine, ladder truck, or ambulance with sirens blazing while you roleplay being a first responder in New York!)"

Let me first off by saying, for being a tech demo its extreamly promising for whats to come. Also more promising with how the devs are taking their time with updates, making sure its ready for us. Along with listening to us about bug reports and such. Now let me get to the game in its current state; as of right now you can only get to know the rigs and controls. Again being a tech demo, I enjoy it so far. I even have fun with some of the bugs that are currently present, but to be fixed in the future. Putting it bluntly, if you enjoy being able to drive some realistic rigs with realistic fuctioning sirens and lights and don't mind only being able to do that for the time being until the game progresses further, I would say its totally worth it in its current state. The other reason I would say to pay the $50 right now is to help fund the development for this game. Again with how promising this game is in its current state and just a peak to whats to come in the future, I went and spent $50 in a heart beat because this is a game I want to see come to full life. Now I'm not going to go over bugs and such because it is a tech demo. But for those of you who are kind of iffy on getting it right now; it is playable in its current state despite a bug here and there. But if you don't want to be only driving rigs for the time being and want to wait for more progress in the future, then wait. Though I would still have to recommend paying the $50 now just to get a taste of how promising this game is as well as help fund the devs to make sure this game comes to full life. Over all being a tech demo, its playable, promising and fun in its current state. Would recommend it to anyone."

When a full game is released, I will re-do the review to discuss the finished game start to finish.Right now this isn't a playable ""game"" like many would expect in Early Access.  It's a demo that allows us to see and try out small parts of the overall game structure while we wait & anticipate a finished game.  FlipSwitch has already pushed out some updates and more are planned to keep the community busy while the game makes its way to the finish line.  Buying into the Tech Demo/pre-game may not be for everyone.  If the lack of existing content or the price point are issues, I recommend waiting until there is more ""meat on the bones"" of the Early Access game or waiting for a finished product.I've been aware of the idea for this game for a long while and I'm aware of what the FlipSwitch guys are capable of.  Anyone that has downloaded and played the Manhattan and Brooklyn mods for Emergency 4 knows what I mean.  I pre-ordered the game at the higher price to have access to a finished game and, more importantly, to support their efforts to succeed.  I look forward to the game when it's complete."

I love the game so far, although it has some issues. But its in my top 3 emergency simulators choices. Playing the game makes me want to be an actual New York City firefighter. Its got a lot of bugs, it laggs like hell and clearly needs work, but its one of my favorite games since GTA V came out. Flipswitch Games, your doing great and we see the effort. We just have to keep patient and wait because when its finished, in my opinion will be the best emrgency simulator out there, especially on Steam.     10 out of 10. I love the game. Keep working hard Flipswitch Games, you have my full support ;)"

At first you can have fun driving around responding to emergencys and making a scene then it gets boring. The lag was reduced a little and you have more options to reduce lag which is great. But if you are intrested in buying this game I would hold out till you see the final product. The developers keep you updated on what will come etc but not progress on the build, for example the third person gameplay notification under the news category in-game has been there since I bought the game a couple months ago and as far as I know there has been to proper update on how it is going. So if you want to drive around blasting sirens and can ignore some bugs then I would reccomend it, if you want gameplay more then driving then you should wait."

There are very few people working on the game, which means progress is going to be slow for a long time. Raf (the owner/main dev) keeps promising dates for releases, which always (9/10 times) gets delayed for some excuse or another. Right now the game is essentially a driving and/or simulator- with horrible AI traffic that also aren't synced with traffic signals, no turn signals and other realism aspects like that, roads with arrows facing the wrong way, Police and EMS vehicles with no interiors or doors working, etc.Raf also stated back in Aprilhttps://gyazo.com/82206e6b05634322d465325519f14cfcthat the game price would permanently be lowered to $25 USD, but Raf misled everyone as usual.I get that this game is being developed by few people, and by an indie developer, but the owner clearly does not have his priorities right and honestly needs to grow up and realize that he needs to cater to his customers, since they have given him a lot of money for something that we all hope is going to become a great game."

Having said that my only advise is to TAKE YOUR TIME GUYS AND GALS.  There is nothing more disappointing then what could and should have been a great game only to be released too early.  I believe we all would agree.Now, having  stated this i do like the progress I see.  I feel the camera views needs additonal work aof following the unit being controlled.  Cameras going through buildings as you attempt to respond to a scene gets confusing and very frustrating.  When you select a unit, camera should default to directly behind thge unit and slightly elevated as in most games, or FP view.  I do like the abilitly of switching seats though.I dont know if its me or what, but I cant wait for full screen.Also, please add a quit or escape button, unless im missing something.

I'm kinda worried about the performance in the future.Please keep in mind that this is an early access title and not a finished product.The negative points or mainly feedback for the devs!- No tutorial or hints.- Traffic AI is pretty bad.- Lots of bugs and things that need to be fixed and tweaked.- The menu and game overlay needs a complete overhaul in my opinion.- It's not a ""game"" yet, there are no missions, it's more like a playground to mess around on.Overall it's a great game and I'd recommend it to anybody who is fine with just messing around. If you're searching for a challenging emergency game you should wait for future updates. The devs seem really motivated to make this an awesome game, but we are really far away from a finished product, so you might want to wait before buying it."

,Not Recommended,461430,30569973,Posted: 17 March,all,geordietony,"I've had this game on my wishlist for a while but the price tag (£26.99) was just way to high, however I had some money in my steam account so decided to use it on this and finally take a leap of faith and buy it.Just for information this game is currently at a tech demo stage and therefore VERY early stages of development.As you would expect there are so many bugs and issues however due to the early stage I wasn't really looking at that. To start off with positives :I think in a few years this game ""could"" (I’ve supported many EA games that have stopped production before) be something great. I love the idea that you get to control all the emergency services and can customise the police and EMS vehicles on the fly.  Imagine joining your friends and creating scenarios and responding to calls and working together as a team. The idea of a whole city to put out fires, respond to crimes and medical situations is really the game I have always wanted. However, this game is SO far away from this at the moment and is at its very core a grand idea at the moment.Visually the fire engines look pretty impressive as well as the blue and red lights on the buildings as you pass.  The sirens sound very realistic and traffic actually gets out of your way as you go behind them. Inside the engines looks amazing too very highly detailed.Overall they have so much to implement and that includes first person, fires to respond too, multiplayer, scene command (what will the EMS and police do) iron out all the bugs, model the city, better UI, better controls, physics .... I could go on and well this will take a very long time to impliment all this.  The last update they talk about a multiplayer option, I just don’t understand this line of devlopment . Get the rest sorted, work on the game add some content and then once you have that then maybe bring the multiplayer in.So in summing up maybe this game will be great, maybe this game will fall flat on its face and I personally don't think the money they are asking for at this point in time is justifiable or worth it. If it was £10 I would maybe take the risk but for £26.99 for and don't forget the term DEMO I’ll refund and invest in something else.Below is a short video I made with my first impressionshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi3G5CmMuNA&feature=youtu.be"

Spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out how to turn on my fire engine and open the door to the get out, while having the worlds loudest siren blaring away. Once i arrived at my first emergency i was met with about 4 other fire engines. Guys that clearly had the same idea as me. Lets drive this thing around New York!Unfortunately when we all arrived there isnt much you can do after that. There was no way to get the pumps going or the lines attached to put the fire out. At the moment its more of a fire truck driving simulator. I would recommend this is there was more to do. But until then it's a no from me. Maybe i'll change my opinion in an update or two.

It was up to us, as customers, to support the devs throughout the build with its many ups and downs. Now we have a situation where they're going to cut the game price which can only mean that the developement may suffer. It costs to pay for programmers and any reduction in funding is only going to make it more difficult.This game is massive in its complexity, and for one, I think possibly beyond the grasp of such a small developement team. However, I paid into this project and I have every confidence that the team will repay me by creating a finished game that has endless hours of complex game play."

This game has the potencial to be a very, VERY good and fun game. Don't feel afraid with the ""Early Access"" warning. I am 100% confident that the team working on the game is not going to give up on it. Update after update, you can feel the love, dedication and efforts of the devs to make EmergeNYC the best experience you can have in this type of game. FlipSwitch has raised $44,000 USD by 853 backers on Indeigogo and $13,081 USD by 198 backers on Kickstarter. There is also a discussion on Steam where you can report any bugs and/or give sugestions to improve the game, and the devs ACTUALLY read everything written in there and take every comment in mind when working on the game.The Promises:It has been promised in the full version of the game the ability for players to being able to be part of the FDNY, FDNY EMS and FDPD, aswell as being able to use every member of a squad, each of them with unique equipment depending on the department you are working. There is also going to be fires, car crashes, shootings, pre-hospital care and even prank calls! The multiplayer servers will have a maximum of 32 players in the same server. Every call will require the use of IRL skills used by the emergency services and the knowledge of the use of every tool avaiable.Patch and review (0.3.0)More buildings have been added. Calls have been added (Building fires, car crashes, manholes on fire). WARNING: Calls can't be ""solved"" yet, there is no way YET for firefighting or rescue. Multiplayer has been added. WARNING: Multiplayer has lots of bugs.Future patches:Players will be able to control every member of a truck.Pros:- Gorgeous firetrucks models;- Good ambulances and police cars models (some still in work);- Customizable police cars, lightbars, colors, etc;- Realistic driving;- Awesome sounds, where you can choose between 3 automatic horns + 1 airhorn + 1 or 2 manual horns (depending on the truck);- Awesome emergency lights;- Third and first person views avaiable;- Spotlights are now optimised;- Singleplayer and multiplayer mode.Cons:- Traffic is still a mess;- Traffic lights don't fully work at the moment;- Multiplayer full of bugs;- Huge FPS drops;- EMS and NYPD vehicles can't be spawned in singleplayer and sometimes in multiplayer.Overall review:The game has a lot of potencial and I fully recommend to invest your money and your time in this game. You will find the demo very entertaining just by exploring everything it is offered to you and the feeling you get everytime there is an update waiting for you to be downloaded with new and fresh content. For me, this might be one of the best indie games of 2017/2018. Will this game be as good as expected? Only time will tell."

I bought mine when it was 50% off because I see this game of having really good potential to be a great emergency simulator to play with friends and maybe even better than LSPDFR, EM4, etc.  The developers take much time out of there day to work on this game for hours and fix as many bugs as they can.  Even with only 3 developers working, updates are coming fast.  What I also like about the developers is they actually look at those who report bugs and take suggestions from us while many other games do not.  Highly recommend this game for all ages and maybe even those who are becoming future FDNY firefighters or even just a volunteer firefighter (as I am myself) as this game can teach you the basics and the codes."

To try to drive a police car, and operate it remotely, is almost impossible.  I wish the designers would have allowed left turns, right turns, stopping, and reverse to be controlled on the Steam controller.  Currently the Steam Controller is only good for accelleration.  While not a critical issue it would be nice if the designers added more realism, in graphics, to Manhattan.  Lower Manhattan, with a few exceptions, is mostly low level buildings--10 floors or less.  A trip down Sixth Avenue should, at least, show Radio City Music Hall and the Time & Life Building (666 Sixth Ave.)RESPONSE TO COMMENT BELOW:""...the world doesnt EVOLVE around you...""

Tried going to multiplayer and just gives me a screen with a bunch of info and never loads. Game crashes. Try just the single player which used to work but now you literally have to laod in each truck seperately which is different and it says to give it like 10 secs. Well I gave it 10 minutes and I tried clicking again and it crashed. Literally cannot play because it crashes. Was so much better a couple months ago when you could actually play it. Which it is nice to play. If you can get that far.

Sank $35 into this (basically the only game I've bought that I didn't wait for a sale before buying) and I personally think it was worth it.[Pros]+ Detailed models+ Authentic EQ2B and horns+ Manual EQ-siren feature (Isn't based on the authentic EQ2B audio the game comes with, oddly enough.)+ Mechanical Q-siren (found on Engine 49 and Rescue 1 only)+ Realistic emergency lighting patterns with toggleable sections (i.e. turn on just the top lights and disable the headlight and taillight flashers)+ Runs fine on low-medium-end hardware(https://gyazo.com/6007c0488442ec399b80b3fb3cb91774+ HD Graphics 530; running a stable 20-30 FPS while driving.)+ Active development and lots of promising promised features+ It's an indie game with working multiplayer; you don't see that often.+ Broken early-stage AI traffic driving habits is amusing. Enjoy ramming your engine into the back of a school bus that doesn't know how to pull over with the Q siren and horns making your ears bleed.+ Light on resource usage; while actively running, EmergeNYC has only been taking up 3 GB of RAM and the load on my processor is manageable.[Cons]- Hardware-demanding; you'll need a beefy setup if you want high FPS.- Demo download is broken, and won't be fixed for a while since it's not a development priority.- The actual game you buy through Early Access is only a tech demo of vehicle mechanics. If you want actual gameplay, come back later.- Camera selection GUI is broken (as of writing)- Noauthentic[mechanical] Q2B (which is reasonable, since (1) New York uses EQ2Bs to put a lid on noise, and (2) Federal Signal put a trademark on the Q2B sound. Mod support is planned, though, so it might not be too much of an issue if someone uploads a mod to add it)- Texture setting affects everything. And I mean EVERYTHING. If I turn down the texture settings too much, then I can't even read what the controls are.- No sensitivity setting (which is annoying because my hardware mouse cursor speed is extremely slow, and I can't fix it)- Map has pockets and is lacking textures for the majority of the city.Overall, though, I think this game has amazing potential. It certainly is game-changing for the simulation industry, since you'd otherwise have to install some crappy mod for GTA V to get anything like this, or buy Emergency 4 for the dispatch feature that's coming up (and both games cost a good chunk of money, of course). If you're willing to invest in EmergeNYC early on, then I recommend that you do it. I think you'll find that the game will end up being worth more than what you paid by the time the full release is published."

When you click onn the NYPD section of the side bar and select a vehical, the vehical doesn't spawn. So basicly I can only use EMS and Fire.2. On EMS New York Fortis, only one of the lights work on the frount rater than the two.3. On one of the streets, the pavement doesn't match up compleatly with the sidewalk leaving a patch of water that your tire can fall into.Those are just some of the many I can think of, but it gives you a good idea at how much work and effort this game needs. I don't know if this game will ever be as good as GTA LSPDFR. The graphics are ok, but most of the game is unfinished and needs years of work.

It's early access, meaning absolutely anything can change. However, I personally think it was WAY to early to put onto Steam. Here is my review of EmergeNYC.BugsEmergeNYC has a crap ton full of bugs. For the devs sake to fix this, I'll go through it a little more detailed.-I was responding to a scene and drove an ambulance there. I parked on the sidewalk next to a building, because there were no pedestrians around (not in the game yet) and it was close to the door. I then switched to a firetruck to help me cover the scene better, and once I showed up...the ambulance was glitching halfway through the wall. When I parked my truck and tried to control the ambulance, the game treated it as if it wasn't even there and spawned me a new one.-(By accident) I rammed into a wall, and my firetruck proceeded to bounce into the air and fall through a building once it came back down.-At certain times when I crashed into a building, you could go right through it.-As I was driving a firetruck to a scene, when I showed up my previous firetrucks that already made it first due bounced off the ground and flew into the air.-Random stoplight spawning causes you to get stuck in them.-First person is extremely glitchy and really hard to control the camera in.Frame Rate-I have a really nice computer that can run really nice games on smooth graphics on medium - high settings. But, with EmergeNYC, on lowest settings, I gettops20-25 FPS. It drops down even lower when responding to a scene with emergency vehicles already there.-If I do anything higher than the lowest traffic spawn option, the game is barely playable.ConclusionIn conclusion, this game is not worth 35 dollars. Maybe 30. With such limited stuff to do, all these bugs, frame rate issues, and glitches, I unfortunately got a refund. I was so exited to play this, and when I got the game, all it was was a dissapointment. I will consider buying the game again when it gets optimized better, bugs and glitches get fixed, and more content is avalible.There is many positive things that come with this game, but the negative beats the positive by a mile in this one.If the devs (FlipSwitch Games) wants to contact me, feel free to message me on Steam. I'm on here almost all the time, and would be more than happy to talk with one of you guys.Adan"

I say they are doing a damned fine job. While there is little in the way of game play mechanics and not all of the assets are there, those that are in the game already are outstanding. I am confident from their previous work that they will continue to work on the game with a high standard as it is their long-time PASSION, not just their profession.Most of the downvotes are from people who are demanding a finished product from an Early Access game, one that is currently in ""pre-alpha"" no less. Look up some youtube videos, hell, just look at the preview pictures. They show unfinished content, textureless buildings, sometimes stuttery framerates, and weird traffic AI; just look at what you're getting into before you buy or don't buy. Do not buy the game expecting a finished product, or even a half way finished product, it's not.Other downvotes are from impatient people complaining about the dev team taking a business trip to NYC to visit their inspiration, the FDNY, instead of working on the game. Others are mad that the dev team takes a weekend off for Mother's day or Father's Day. If you have a problem with that, you need to step away from the computer, go into the bathroom, and look at the mirror. Downvoting a game because of the devs' devotion to the relationship with their families is asinine.If you feel the game is worth $35 in its current state, buy the gameIf you feel the game is not worth $35 in its current state but you are patient and as confident in the devs ability and motivation as I am that they will deliver a wonderful product IN TIME, buy the game.If you feel the game is not worth $35 in its current state, you do not have confidence in the devs to deliver a finished product, and/or you are impatient, do not buy the game, get angry, and write a stupid negative review discouraging people from even giving the game a chance.This isn't a $70 AAA game with a $30 season pass and day 1 DLC that is buggy and broken, this is a $35 pre-alpha indie title. Take a breath, come back in a week, check out the changes, play for an hour or two, report feedback to the devs to help better the game (They are listening!), and wait for the next update.It will get better, it will get more content, it will take time, please be patient."
,Recommended,461430,30596656,Posted: 18 March,all,Airborne ✓,"EmergeNYC Early Access ReviewSummary of the GameEmergeNTCis a simulation based game that allows you to play as multiple services from the Fire Dept., Police Dept., and EMS Dept.. Although you can play as the police and EMS the fire dept. is were all the effort as of now is being put. As of now you can drive multiple vehicles from trucks to cars that have working lights, sounds, and interactable interrior*. Be aware that the current state of this game is early acess, and if you purchase this game you are aware that you may be playing with unfinsihed textures, shotty graphics/sounds, and glitches/bugs.My personal takeAs of now with the current build of the game I would rate it a 6/10 ""Worth considering"". If the game gets any better than it is for gameplay, performance, and graphics my rating will most likely go up as well. I bought this game when it was in its early early development build where there was only a few buildings with textures, and very bugy but new features.Pro(s)The development team for this game is quite small, andnotlike aAAA+using aSaaSsystem for revenue. As of now this game has quite a bit to offer in its current state. If you're a fan of driving around in emergency vehicles and nothing else you will like this game. As of now you have multiple vehciles to drive around flash your lights and play with the sirens, but with what you can respond to.... nothing much.Con(s)Like i've said before I own this game for a while and with only 8 hours of gameplay on it I don't have much room to talk, but what I can talk about is there postpones. Ever since december of 2016 they have announced a multiplayer option that will be released January of 2017. AlthoughFlipSwitchGamesis a small company making this game they shouldnt have much excuse for the delays. **PERSONAL NOTE** If you are going to advertise multiplayer, show us a working build, and still keep on delaying it than dont keep saying that multiplayer might come out soon.Just say it wont until futher notice!!!!Don't keep getting us hyped in over mutlipayer that will most likely be buggy, crashy, and shotty.DON'T BE LIKE SEAN MURRAY!!!EndingAll in all this game is still very good for what we have to play with. But with continue support and funding for the company this game can be quite good. Maybe as good as the Emergency series or if lucky the GTA LSPDFR series. If you have the money and want to be apart of the team to help them build a new game, than this is for you. But if you want to buy this just to drive around and not deal with the graphics, FPS issues, etc than this is not for you. If you just want a solid game base, or gameplay than this isnt for you.This is a IN_DEV Review, come back for a complete review in the far or possibly near futureEdits may be applied for spelling, grammar,  etc.If you have anything to say please comment!!!"

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!(This game is real fun!)"

I understand this is a work in progress however what has been released so far is litterally a joke.  DO NOT buy this product at its current state.  Patch #1 has already been delayed twice. The listing of this game on steam was not becasue it was at a state to be released but instead is a revenue generating tool to help production of it.  What you get is a very bad driving simulator that is riddled with bugs and contains the bare minimum of graphics, mostly just white boxes where graphics will eventually go.TLDR: Do not buy, game is soooooo early in Alpha its not worth your risk and gameplay isnt enjoyable enough to justify."

,Recommended,461430,31196033,Posted: 17 April,all,racingpro34,"One of few games that Im legitimately looking forward to seeing what they can develop.  Been waiting for a game like this for years!! Yes theres bugs and yes theres problems but its an early access game and that is to be expected.  These guys are working with ONLY 2 devs.  Its amazing what theyve been able to come up with to this point.  Keep checking their facebook page for updates on the game and if you want this game to be successful and to develop faster, buy the early access and play and report your issues.  Dont give up on a team who is working hard to make an amazing game in a complex city like NYC.Now to rating the game on the current content (As of 20170417):Rigs: 8/10 -Some siren sounds are off but siren sounds have copyrights and licenses attached so they cant be identical as much as we want them to beFire Stations: 6/10 -Been to NYC and not all stations are built into other stores and storefronts.  There is one station (Rescue I believe) that is a stand alone building.  Id also like to see the ability to open only one bay door instead of all on every station.Graphics: 7/10 -Could be better and it will be with optimization and adding in textures of buildings.Physics: 6/10 -Driving is still a work in progress, getting the sensitivity just right to mimick the weight and turning radius of rigs is a challenge.  Ladder movement is pretty decent although there is no ladder sway like we would see in real rigs.  Driving the Tiller Ladder (Hook and Ladder) is a pain in the rear end.  Forward isnt so bad but if your trying to park that beast back in the station, good luck.Overall, this game will lead the Fire/EMS gaming world and hopefully bring in lots of $$ so these guys can move it onto even maybe console like so many people wanted. Cant wait to see what the devs roll out next.  I know the biggest thing Im waiting for is to see how they are doing the dispatch system.  Just hope and pray they add a role as a dispatcher.Great game and will only get better!! If youre thinking about it, just do it! More funding = better game."

I've been a licensed Paramedic and an Advanced Emergency Medical Dispatcher in Texas for over 12 years. EmergeNYC brings my love of helping people into the virtual world of gaming. I believe that this game will garner interest in Public Service when it gets its full release.The software developers acknowledge the games early  shortcomings, but they are keen to keep us up to date as much as possible. They are not some huge company working with huge budgets. They are working magic with what they've got, and they spend a lot of time it seems to try and iron out the bugs that get reported properly.If you like games dealing with emergencies, police, fire, and EMS AND first person point of view, please, please, please, give this game a fair chance.

Don't buy this game yet, wait until it has more to show in future updates.EDIT: So after getting the game to finally launch, and with the release of the BETA builds, there's a few things I want to let off my chest about this game SO FAR. It has the right ideas and moving in the right direction, but it feels like the developers are working on stuff that shouldn't be worked on at the game's initial phase. There are a few times where I can get stuck at cluttered UI popups. I won't talk about performance since this game is being updated and worked on so performance can hopefully change over time. Vehicles look really good, and perform ""well"" in the single player while mp has lots of input lag, but that changes depending on the host.If your computer is potato and you know it's potato, I'd hold off buying the Early Access just yet unless you are VERY certain that your potato pc can prosper through it. Because you need a decent PC right now as of writing this review (and decent is even pushing it). I believe that's really all I need to say. I hope that this game gets to the point where it's my go to game over GTAV modding. FSG (FlipSwitchGames) you guys are doing a good job so far, just remember to get the important stuff down first.

People need to realize anyone can make a game that is so so , these guys are taking the proper steps to make this a Simulator that covers alot of ground and they are trying to get us gamers as close to real life situations as possible. You still have my vote in the positive end ! Keep it up ! Cant wait to see what else pops up in the near future."

One thing that keeps me from playing this is the lag and bugs. It is unreal my FPS is at 10 if not even and I have a good computer with a great grahics card that ecxeeds the requirments for the game and all of my oyther games run fine.

( and when i say over the shoulder shooter when police are playable killing my be fun but atcually a police sim that doesnt focase on lethal force) keep up the good work devs and dont take♥♥♥♥♥♥from no one!"

,Recommended,461430,32117796,Posted: 1 June,all,123B3n,"I mean right now it's I'm very early development, however, I can see great potential with this game. It's a game which is very unique comparing to other games.Keep in mind it's early development, I've been following the development for a while and unlike most other Early access games the developers here really listens to the community's​ input and thoughts. With weekly updates, I quite enjoy it. However, Early access Kinda makes it not the best and enjoyale game right now, but once your able to control your own character and so on, will be a game changer and you won't be so stricted to only be in the cars and actually interact with the world. I highly recommend the game, but you still have to keep in mind that inte Early development."

,Recommended,461430,29640827,Posted: 1 February,all,benn,"I'm back again, writing another review on EmergeNYC.I've hit over 120 hours on this game and I truly think it's amazing, but it's just going to keep getting better. Being into fire photography, fire departments & emergency services myself, I think this game is just awesome. I love the trucks, sirens, map, everything. Enviroment is so detailed around you it feels like you're in New York.YES, this game does have a long way to come, but if you've noticed the progress from where they first started out you'd be amazed. The entire map is complete and it looks great.Once the firefighting, police & paramedic aspect comes into this game I can guarentee you that this game will be a top seller. It's amazing so far but will progress into a masterpiece in the near future. The last review I wrote, I discussed how the game was already detailed, the driving was great & how the AI Traffic needed improvements. FlipSwitch Games immediately responded to me & released a AI Traffic & Graphics update. I couldn't ask for more after that. It's absolutely stunning to drive & NOW WALK around New York as a First Responder.In the end, I give the game a 9/10. Still needs a few more improvements that I know the team will find & fix. For now, Thank you FlipSwitch Games for releasing such a great game. Even though it's only in Early Access, I still love it. Feels great to play it. Major stress reliever unless the traffic won't move out of the way lol."
,Recommended,461430,34147715,Posted: 10 August,all,Sgtcoolboy176,"Everyone is being so quick to judge the game in its current state but I think that people forget its still in Early Access. Your not buying the game; Your supporting & encouraging the developers to develop the idea of this game and bring it too life in which I think they are doing a bang up job of it. Don't get me wrong, theres not alot to do in its current state (hence the 3 hrs play time) except drive around and run around (With the recent update you can now run around with a character) and do some RP for now but the progress they are making is incredible as they try their best to bring out constant updates and I can say that I truely don't regret the decision to support these developers in creating possibily an amazing game.I also want to encourage others to show their support for them. There isn't alot of decent Emergency Simulation games out there as I would believe its a very niche market and developers don't tend to cater to us since they don't see the monitery value in it. So its also quite brave of them to develop it regardless and thats another reason I support them.Carry on with the good work."
