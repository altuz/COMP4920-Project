,Not Recommended,461490,25522053,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Aaron552™,"Potentially Dead Game!I reviewed this last on September 17, 2016. It is now October 20, 2016 and it doesn't look like there have been absolutely any updates. It's a fun casual game, but it gets boring too quickly and is too easy to play.Edit: The developer just now replied to my review (November 30, 2016) letting me know what's up. Hopefully there are more updates to come now. I will be updating my review as things change - if they change.ReviewI do not recommend this game in its current state. Here's a simple explanation on why.It's too easy. I've been playing for 30 minutes and stopped at Level 13 to keep farming level 7 for ""Juice"" or in-game money. All it takes is 110 to buy a Giant Golem which is probably the best card you can buy. You get 50-56 Juice for finishing a level 10-0 so every two levels completed - or farmed - gets you a Giant Golem. I now have 15 Giant Golems and am unstoppable right now, and I've only played for half an hour.Edit:I'm editing my review with some more information about the game rather than just how it plays.Kaboom Monsters is a very interesting game. If you'd like to know about what it plays like, read some of the other reviews. The game itself, I enjoy it. After the 30 minutes I played before writing the top half of my review, I played for about another 2 hours the next day. I completed the rest of the levels and began equiping all 15 of my Giant Golems with the strongest and best gear available. However, currently, the features the game includes are not needy. They're just there for show.For example, right from the beginning when you unlock the Market you can buy anything. You can buy all the cards and you can buy all available and unlocked equipment. The booster packs are irrelevent as well as buying materials to make weapons and shields. What's the sense of getting rid of three cards to make a stronger one when you can easily afford the best card in the game by time you reach Level 7? My recommendation to fix this is to put locks on the cards until you've reached a set milestone, and increasing the prices of all the cards. Especially the rarer ones. One onion rarity are cheap, two onion rarity are moderate, and three onion rarity are expensive.Other than all of that, the game has got immense potential and I will be following this game and updating my review as things are changed. However, like I said above, in its current state, it's too easy."
76561198116527414,Not Recommended,461490,28893612,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Sigmar,"First of all, my negative judgement is preliminary, as it is still an early access game. I also want to mention that the developer contacted me a few weeks ago and promised to publish a final version soon, which is always a good sign.At this moment however, my verdict must be: This game is cute, but it feels a little weird.  The quite original gameplay combines concepts of trading card games (destroy the opponent's cards by beating them in certain stat numbers) with the 3x3 grid of Tic-Tac-Toe. This ""combat"" is embedded in a rudimentary fantasy world with crafting and merchant hubs, where you can upgrade your cards. I do like the artstyle, and I appreciate that the creator wanted to try a new idea. For my personal taste however, the execution of that idea has not matured yet. The game world needs to be fleshed out further, with NPCs and some lore, in order to feel authentic. The progression needs balancing, because right now, the way to go is to grind certain resources and then buy cards of the strongest type, which then devastate everything that stands in front of you. Most importantly, the cardgame combat system is not satisfying at the moment, as you can only choose the card you want to deploy from a very limited selection, so there is too much chance involved in how the ""battle"" plays out.I hope that this kind of criticism helps to make this game more enjoyable in the future, and I will gladly check it out again and change my review if the developer lives up to his promise and makes some improvements."

The final AI decks are too powerful, the only way to defeat them is grind for hours on stages you can beat easily the first time around.  Support and updates are minimal.  It's just not going anywhere playable soon."
,Not Recommended,461490,24699103,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Flapjaw,"I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone for any reason. The supposed fantasy world that doesn't take itself too seriously doesn't actually exist. Make no mistake: this is a bad card game and nothing more. There is no story to dig into nor characters to care about. The game is abysmally short, even for early access, and the only increase in difficulty is that the AI gets flatly stronger cards to work with.There is the slight possibility of strategy but this would only matter in a match with mirrored or balanced decks, which will never be the case. The first mission is literally impossible to lose because this is merely a numbers game. When and if player versus player is implemented as promised the player who did the most grinding for ""juice"" will always win, guranteed. If you grind long enough to have only the most powerful cards with the strongest equipment then you've already experienced the full depth of this game.There are twenty-three matches to be played on the ""map,"" though to call the singleplayer a map or campaign is to overstate it. There is a slight bit of instructional dialogue with horrible grammar in the tutorial and then nothing for most of the matches, while occassionally a set of nonsensical imagery will pop up like a comic before a mission. Keep in mind that once you beat the final match you will be forced to click through the last comic any time you play any match anywhere until that glitch is fixed.On top of the grinding tedium you will not be rewarded for achievements until you click into the achievement list in-game and redeem them one at a time, with no scrollbar to make the process quick. Furthermore equipment cannot be moved from card to card so if you need to use an equipped card to create a stronger card you will also have to make that equipment again. Plus, once you beat a match replaying it only yields juice rather than the card and resource rewards, so when you run out of new matches to play the grinding gets much slower.I will never play this game again and I'm selling my trading cards. Please, don't waste your money here unless the final version proves to be much better. If there was any nuance to the gameplay at all I would not be so harsh, but there is none."
,Not Recommended,461490,29999987,Posted: 17 February,all,Laenthor,"Just because I don't recommand a cheap indie game doesn't mean it's the worst thing ever.This game is basically triple triad from FFVIII, but with a cute art style. You place cards with 4 numbers and you need to place them besides the other player's cards to make them your own. You can find, buy and combine cards and you can craft weapons to make some cards just a little stronger. Good concept, but there's a lot of annoying things that ruin the experience. This is early access, but in 6 months a whole ""update"" came along, not doing much.First of, I think the absance of audio should come in priority. I tought it was me, but I was playing music at the same time. No music, no sound effect, nothing!There is no way to quit the game except alt+f4, which is okay I guess if you know how, but what if you don't like most kids who will play this game? Or if there is I couldn't find it...I got this game at the absolutely low price of 0.30 C$, but seriously, go play FFVIII on your playstation (not the steam release please, have decency!), you'll have more fun there.This game just screams new-age flash game, and it should almost be one! If it was, I would actually be pleased with what I got, even with ads. But here on Steam, I was expecting a bit more polish and content... Still, like I said, it's not horrible, just incredibly blend and not a ""revolutionary fantasy strategic card game"", because clearly Square Enix did that first."
,Not Recommended,461490,24165481,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,Kit,"In this game you play on a 3*3 grid.  You put down a card and if the number on the edge is more than an opponent's card then their card turns to your colour and you get a point.  That's pretty much it for the core game mechanic (there's a bit more such as cards vanishing after a certain number of turns).You then have some interesting card upgrade mechanics such as combining cards and making weapons for the cards.The game has a nice look and feel - but I just found the battle mechanics to be simple and boring.  There are no chain reactions, not much strategy - as you progress the levels and the enemy numbers get higher then you'll need to spend more time combining cards and making weapons.  I enjoy some grind in a game - makes for relaxing progress, but I just can't get past the core battle aspects being so simple.I think the developer needs to go back and redesign the core battle.Anyhow - if you like the idea of the battle system I described then give this game a go, because it seems a nice game otherwise."
,Not Recommended,461490,26373967,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,Evengiolon,"Kaboom Monsters is a strategy, card battling, adventure game. When you launch the game, you will have the option on 1 out of 3 decks to choose from. There is no clear cut difference, so picking the 'good looking one' is the picking method. The battle screen has a 3x3 game board in the center of the screen and your available cards display on the right of the battle area. Turn based between you and the computer opponent. Kaboom Monsters cards has a series of numbers on each side, which represents its attack/defense strength. You also have another number in the upper left corner, which represents the number of turns a card can remain in play. When you place a card next to an opponent's card, the numbers determine the victor, meaning if the card has the higher value, you will turn your opponent's card to your side. If the value is equal or less than your opponent's card then all stays unchanged. The Smithy will arm or upgrade your cards, the Wizard can combine three of the same cards into a more powerful card.This game can be play for a little while or you can choose to play at length. For me it was difficult to understand the scoring system in the beginning, but as I played it became easier. The game got quite boring after a while as the computer opponents cards got quite strong, quite fast. Not a game that I would play again in a hurry. Fun to play when there is little time for anything else, but could always find something else to do."

,Recommended,461490,24257935,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,riotsquad,"Updates to the original review due to my new PC crashing and I therefore installed it on my old PC (Phenom II 955, R9 285 ITX, Win 7) which has changed my opinion on it, sort of. (so I'll make this a dual review)Win 7 box:It worked quite well TBH, played about 30 mins. and enjoyed it, hence the thumbs up and I also saw that PvP is coming which I think will be quite fun as you prob. won't get to face the same deck over and over as everyone goes to Kaboopwned. com to find out what and how to play.I've finished the tutorial now and I'll keep on playing this, I'm hoping they get it more properly working with Win 10 as well so I won't have to use this PC every time I want to play this. (that's quite clearly an issue with Unity rather than the game though)Win 10 box:The sound's brutally loud - which is what's being discussed in comments, one thing I forgot to add is that I also do record and therefore the volume settings are more vital than if I hadn't - annoyingly loud TBH.I can't say for sure it's only Unity and Win 10 screwing things up or if it's that combo and something with that box that does it but all Unity engine games I've tried on it has had the sound issue and other issues too, so I wouldn't recommend any Unity engine game for the Win 10 platform as it is... ()unsure if any of them's worked well on it, MechaNika certainly didn't at all, it was in an awful state and worked great on this box...)"

76561198069644636,Recommended,461490,29109581,Posted: 7 January,all,Spawnie,"It's a nice little game. Got it with a hefty discount of 90% through a badge so I couldn't even complain if it was bad. Iplayed it with my son and then he played it alone for some time.I wouldn't pay the full $2.99 for it though, maybe it's worth that for some when the multiplayer is available. There are no chainreactions as other have mentioned which would make it a bit more complex. It sure is a timewaster if you like to replay the same levels over and over again to get the best cards available. But then it's not a challenge anymore.It surely shows that it's been developed for mobile though..."
76561197963164050,Recommended,461490,33647433,Posted: 19 July,all,NighT WolF,"It's early access, so hopefully it will see a lot of improvements, because so far, it's a fun game. But there is just too much wrong with it.- Crafting is useless (you can buy everything and it's cheaper)- Easiest levels give the same amount of juice as the hardest- You can buy EVERYTHING, even the most powerful cards- No way to delete useless cards and your Inv becomes a mess- After buying the most powerful cards, there is no challenge left- Booster packs are unbalanced and overprized (2 Bronze packs are cheaper than 1 gold pack and you get more cards and the same amount of rare cards)Some suggestions for possible improvements:- Crafting overhaul for the weapons: Buy weapons and use materials to improve them further, maybe 3 levels of improvement- You can't buy cards, without crafting them first- You can't play a level twice, only make a random game, based on you current level- Possible to sell cards- Convert cards into materials- Levels don't give almost the same amount of juice, no matter how hard- You can claim a card after beating a level- Less juice in general, more materials- Cards are much more expensive, so it's harder to craft/buy the most powerful- Pricing for the booster packs needs improvementBut would i recommend it? Well, it has potential and looks great. So yes and no. If you don't mind the flaws and you are searching for a rather easy game, then go for it. Doesn't cost much, so why not."

76561198198655669,Recommended,461490,35246964,Posted: 27 September,all,Sir_Puddington,"It's a relatively easy card game after you've maxed out your deck with Giant Golems (Gotten from the market, at the very end. They costs 110, so by the time you're in the early 20s, most if not all your cards should be these). There isn't much to the game and it is repetitive, but I found it enjoyable.Having more descriptive achievements would be helpful, took a while for me to get Chicken Farmer (Use the wizard after finding all three, one can be gotten from the tutorial, another from completing level 25, and the last is hidden in the Credits)."
