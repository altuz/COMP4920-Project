,Recommended,461500,22795101,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,Whirlmeister,Great game little game. Not a huge amount of depth but seems easy to dip in and out of it. I'm not sure a lot has been added over the Gear VR version though. It does however seem a lot clearer and more defined.Played on an HTC Vive. Was a lot of fun for me. My wife also tried but it made her nausious so you have been warned. It may cause VR sickness.

Turning by looking. Turning by snaping. Incremental turning.Snaping or incremental turning did not make me motion sick, but wasnt much fun either.If you are relatively immune to motion sickness you may give it i try.For me, this is no go."

It runs smoothly and has a bunch of missions, new area unlocks, etc.However, I highly recommend to the developers that they incorporate the Vive's controllers in order to help reduce motion sickness (if that's possible.) Using the XBOX controller really turned my stomach after a while, especially when rotating. Some indoor areas such as tunnels made it feel like the rotation speed suddenly doubled.As far as motion sickness goes, I was really beginning to think I wouldn't get it. Windlands doesn't bother me, and I thought if any game was going to get me sick it would be Windlands. But no. This game is on a whole different level in terms of motion. It's the first game I've had to stop playing after feeling nautious (after an hour).It's such a well made game, I really don't want to return it. Hope to give it another go in a day or two and see how it goes, but anyone with a weak stomach should probably look elsewhere and avoid this game for their own sake."

Flying around in a jetpack in VR..I mean, who wouldn't want to do this?The game itself is pretty cool, even the freeflight mode has you searching for briefcases and solving little puzzles to get your blueprints..but after approximately 15 minutes, I suffered that pretty bad nausea feeling from playing this. I suffered a tiny bit playing Dreadhalls and noticed that any game where you're playing with a joypad and have to use the right control to move your direction, the nausea begins.I had this on the Samsung Gear VR and played it quite a bit and it didn't bother me as much as when I tried it on the Vive. I played it whilst sitting, thinking that this would help with any disorientation but the sickeness was there even after approx 1 hr.Really disappointed as I really want to love this..but I ended up getting a refund :(Recommended but if you are prone to sickness..you'll probably suffer. God help the people playing the Oculus with a joypad..urrggh."

Second only to windlands for the Vive right now, in my opinion.While still rather shallow compared to non-vr titles, when compared to other Vive games out right now, it's one of the fullest game experiences I've played.This IS, however, one of the worst games for motion sickness. I felt it after about an hour, and I have never felt motion sickness in any game on Vive. Just rotate slowly and it's far less of a problem. It's the ninja rotaton in enclosed spaces that actually starts to get me. I could play out in the open city with reasonable rotation all day long. I'm DETERMINED to get my ""VR Legs"" so I can play this game for even longer.This does require an xbox controller. It's a seated game and the Vive controllers don't work, but that's not a con at all. I rather like it."

Has player movement which can be problems, but the positional movement didn't seem to impact motion sickness but the rotation does, feels like it needs an option to turn that rotation speed down. And add that to the time trial nature of everything means this can be an intense game for eye strain.Having to use a controller sucks. I know it makes sense for the game, but the virtual hands in the world map to 2 joysticks and it seems like these conuld be emulated somehow with Vive controllers.This is still a great game though. Nice art style, good progression structure, weapons feel cool, but it sure feels like they are stretching content. I blasted through more than half of it in this first session (30mins?). Lots of repetition in mission types, the narrative is that you are training and maybe it will get real in the later mission groups."
,Recommended,461500,24660297,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,Bassem,"After just half an hour of play, I can already tell I'm in love with this game. It's exactly the kind of flying experience I like, and I took to it like fish to water, weaving and ducking between buidings and under bridges. The game is polished and well presented.I have not yet played long enough to know if there's enough depth for the asking price, but I can at least say that the flight mechanics are excellent. I played in Free Flight mode so far, and loved hunting around for collectibles. To be honest I'd be happy with the game being just that if it offers many more locations. But it seems that it's one location with many game modes inside it.Anyway, a word of warning, this game does require you to have very steady VR legs. And it's playable seated and with a gamepad, which makes sense for a flight game."

,Recommended,461500,28716271,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Introitus,"Simple, yet quite enjoyable. In this VR experience you find yourself in a jet back, given the freedom to roam around the city. Be warned this game may induce nausea and vomiting in those with little VR experience. Making sure your head is always pointing in the direction of travel will help alleviate some of this. This title also includes some small game aspects, including shooting targets and racing through hoops. Quite a solid download for the cost."
,Recommended,461500,22817706,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,smartACE,"Jetpack is the way to go for solving VR movement problems! You can go anywhere and have complete freedom in Omega Agent. Sure, you can make yourself sick if you spin around too fast but I've found it very comfortable and have had no issues playing for a long session. The game itself is a bit limited in scope, but I can see the awesome potential here. If a full story and more cities were added this would be a really great VR game. Basically you can perform race challenges that require you to fly through rings quickly or shoot down objects, but my favorite part is just the free flight where you can explore the city and feel like you're actually flying. I hope they port this game to IRL."
76561197970421503,Recommended,461500,29820637,Posted: 10 February,all,lairyboy,"I loved this game. Most missions are really fun and there is a nice sense of exploration early on in the game despite the limited island scale. There is a reasonable amount of replayability in trying to attain full stars on the missions ranging from Pilotwings style fly through the rings to target practice and later on, a few nice boss encounters. Some of the puzzles are fun but I would have liked to see more and more intricate puzzles, seeing as these are the same devs who developed the awesome 'The room' series. Finally a word of caution, as others have stated, this is at the extreme end of VR experiences because you control your left right turning with a thumb stick which can be a little bit disorientating, or nausia enducing in some."

I love flying around and while i dont mind the controllers this would be fun with vive or oculus touch.

This is one of those very few games that just feels perfect. Everything is polished. Gameplay is fantastic.Don't bee fooled by the graphics, this game is all about gameplay and the simplistic graphics helps out with the fast paced movement.I recommend changing the settings for the rotation to ""Right Stick Snap"". After doing that I no longer had a problem with motion sickness! It may feel a bit awkward or ugly at first, but you'll get used to it."

(reviews were fair to poor and motion sickness comments abounded).  I'm now typing this while I take a break from the game. (I played for about an hour) didn't get any sickness until  (lightly) around 30 minute. And (need to take a break) at about 60 minutes.   Thing is (unlike windlands) the motion sickness was WORTH IT.  I hope I'll get more amune to it as I want to get back into it a.s.a.p.VERY polished, smooth, no jitter, controls feel great (though I'm not a xbox controller fan.... its perfectly logical for this (so far).  I've only played through tutorials and a couple missions of flight path/waypoints before I had to take a break. Once missions include the gun/missle use it will be amazing.     I tried teh ""jump turn"" option and didn't like it.  I went back to smooth.  I think I'll become ammune and it wasn't bothering me that fast.   My only con's are you feel like you're in the twilight zone (nothing else alive)?  Maybe some birds?  traffic on the streets?   I see in the screen shots above there will be  baddies and other things to shoot at and maybe that will make me feel less ""alone"".  Multiplayer or team - with another person or persons could be cool.  Even if combat...  or race things.   The STUFF IS HERE for greatness, I hope for DLC that we can purchase to add more functionality.  Imagine using motion controllers in doing missions?  racing and shooting things along the path (like a shooting gallery) could be done.  LEARDER boards to compare world wide scores etc.   At this point for this price it is a MUST BUY.     SO MANY VR games seem like demo's.  This one (so far) feels like a real/complete game"" and I've only touched upon what it offers.  I've also passed on DESCENT which seems very over priced. This is far more game for 1/2 the price.

This is the only VR game I get this from and it literally makes me feel like being sick. A real shame because otherwise its a great game
76561198030519086,Recommended,461500,28258352,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,Trogdor,Absolutely adore this game - probably one of my fave hidden gems of year one VR'ing :D  I didnt pick this up months ago because i'd heard a lot of people talking about it triggering motion sickness.  I can see why!  However i've been using the Vive regularly for the last 6 months and have built up a very heavy tolerance to mo-sick in that time - so buying this now means i haven't been affected much at all!  Wouldnt recommend playing for longer than an hour in one session though as after that time I did start to feel the twinge oncoming :PThis has the look and feel of a very solidly built VR game.  Its akin to the rocketpack missions from old Pilotwings on the SNES mixed with the freedom of movement on a whole island from Pilotwings Resort!  ^^  Theres loads of missions and loads of collectibles to find that will result in a couple of cool unlockables.  I don't even have an issue with having to use the Joypad for this one as it allows a more comfortable sitting position than if i was having to wave the controllers all over the place :)  Really fun and totally worthwhile.

If you don't suffer from motion sickness, this game is worth checking out. I'm iffy with motion sickness, some VR is no problem, others like this, big issues. Still, would recommend checking it out... if it works for you, it's stupid amounts of fun."

Would be even better if one could use the Vive wands instead of xbox controller, but still workable. When dangling through the air over a city in a realistic manner, a certain percentage of people will feel motion sickness - it's inherent in this type of game, and I'm glad they haven't hobbled it to ease the complaints. Looking forward to a VR paragliding simulator!"

On that version, it gives you a swivel chair turning option, which, for example, lets you turn to the right while looking to the left. This version does not give you that option. It only lets you turn with the right analog or turn by looking. Maybe, they left it out because they didn't think people with cords would want that option, but I would with my HTC Vive, as I can stand and turn all day long. Also, they should give it motion controller support.Update: I'm now recommending this because they lowered the price."
