This isn't even an early access game its a full game.Good:1. 60 FPS2. Cheap Game3. Ok GraphicsBad:1. Can't equip guns2. Can only pickup 7 items even though I clearly have 24 inventory slots.3. The character movement (W, A, S, D) is to quick like I have super speed.4. Small amount of options in menu (No sound settings)5. Invisible wall between a fence that I found that I could normally walk through.6. Picked up Tablet, but couldn't see it in inventory and no buttons would open it up.7. The blue stamina bar is too light its needs to be brighter, so we can see it."

It crashed after second time I died. I guess it knew I was finished playing only after 11 minutes.  I doubt I'll play it again in it's current state.
,Not Recommended,461520,31445281,Posted: 29 April,all,CorvusCorax,"A great idea for an indie game but, unfortunately, bad execution. The game focuses on grizzly bear hunting (or it seems so) - the first section of the game is all about collecting supplies in our house such as bandages, medkits and weapons. Once we hit ""use""  on our car the 2nd section begins which consists of a forest with some houses here and there. This is where the game randomly puts a grizzly that begins the hunting as soon as it sees us.And this is where the problems start. If we pick up a gun at home you'd think the objective will be to kill mentioned animal. However, in order to use our car once more (in the forest) the game tells us to bring a battery and a tool box. Since the vehicle is parked at an intersection it seems to be broken down. After all, we are not the hunters but more like the hunted party here. The snowy forest is, essentially, an area where free roaming is allowed.It is a must to pick up our tablet at home as it'll show the map of the surrounding area with the highlighted buildings where the needed items may or may not spawn. The problem is that this is random just as the bear's appearance. Whenever we reach a building the grizzly immediately appears outside. It starts circling the area but it can never enter. Once outside if we are unable to reach the sufficient distance the animal keeps chasing us and of the 2 of us he is the faster one.  A couple of hits can kill us and we can start over.Many people highlighted the unfinished nature of this game. How difficult it is to pick up and deliver both needed items back to the car as our inventory can only hold a maximum of 10 kilos. Additionally, several minutes are spent at the beginning of the game finding out what keys we can use for playing as the menu does not offer any options for key bindings. Beside some sensitivity and graphics settings we do not get anything regarding our controls.Once again we have a Unity-based software meant to be an easy cash-grab. We have missing options, non-existing story, short gameplay and bugs / glitches here and there. There are a few threads in the discussion section on Steam and no existing guides which already explains the success this game has. It is unfortunate that the developer has a similar set of games in his library - almost all with negative feedback. Grizzly Valley is nice to look at on the store page - it has no other value."

In its current state it's quite impossible to beat, which I guess is the developers laugh on us. You first appear in a house and receive a phone call from your sister who asks on the answering machine when you are coming over. You immediately put the phone down and get ready for the trip into Canada's bear country by equipping all the necessary goods.Problem is you can't kill the bear, you can't really out run the bear, you can't shake hands with the bear, and you can't sit down and work out an enterprise bargaining agreement with the bear. All you can do is startle the bear by waiting for his nostrils to rest on top of your gun nozzle before you shoot, ending with him just running away and later pouncing and charging on you like he is some sort of huntsman spider. Or simply offer your head up as a picnic basket so you can be done with this game.Upon your car breaking down as you enter into this Canadian wilderness, you might as well sacrifice yourself because the ending is quite impossible to orchestrate. You see the ultimate objective is for you to find the parts (Car battery & Tool box) necessary to fix the car and leave. Problem is you can't carry the two items needed together as they weigh too much, also your car doesn't accept the items individually. Place the items near the car individually and they disappear. Press all the keys on the keyboard and the car still says no. Hand the items to the bear and ask him to fix your car and he kindly says thankyou by munching down on your cranium. The developer hence gives you a Kobayashi Maru impossible win scenario, this forces a player with the need to deal with a helpless situation. The only way pass this would be to fix the results as Captain Kirk did. Maybe a Modder in future will save us all by rewriting the programming and allow us to chase the bear around the wilderness and bite him. I'd sure pay for that experience.Personally I did not appreciate the no win experience, I also found a few bugs where i could walk through walls and doors, other than an initial scare  with the bear, when I discovered that each building is a safe haven, it really wasn't scary, just annoying. The mechanics of the bear being frightened by the gun is not consistent. The gun load and reload function is abysmal. DO NOT BUY THIS. Honestly why would you pay $5.00 for this when you can get the game completely free by doing a quick google search? There are many sites that offer this game free. Below is as far as you can get in the game...https://youtu.be/EPhw_G1JFCc"

You're thrown into a situation where if you didn't pick up the map device, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. A bear attacks from the left, middle or right and if you didn't pick up a gun he gets you within the first 30 seconds. None of the situation is explain to you and it takes about 2-3 bears per distance travelled between each point. <Rifle is useless because of lack of ammo.Overall; 1/10."

So why the negative review?Sadly the execution is poor, mainly the game balance. It seems almost impossible to complete thanks to some wonky AI issues with the bear and a cumbersome interface. You cannot collect enough supplies to esacpe the bear for more than a couple  of encounters. As the bear is more like a heat seeking missile, you can see the problem. Also there is no way to collect further supplies in game.If the map had been a little larger, and the weight limit on your inventory a little more forgiving, this could have been an aswesome game. Sadly its not. Hopefully the Dev will take this and work to improve it for his next game."

I must note I wanted this game when I fist saw it on steam and it wasn't released yet so everything looked like a game ive been waiting for.Con Flaws: I start every game with the revolver, 18 rounds, flashlight, baking powder, and tablet. No save so everytime i get touched by the griz he insta kills me and i have to redo the same gathering faze which having been killed quicker than it takes me to gather inventory has made me really hate the gathering part.Con Flaw: The Griz has horrible hitboxes where you can actually get a shot to make him run away. I found following in back of the bear shooting his♥♥♥♥♥or side to be the only effective hit spots that work. The head is just a waste of ammo.Pro Flaw: One of the only things that the player can use to his advantage is going into a building, The griz will not come in and will just circle the building making the annoying growl/howl like a dog sound. I let him pass the entrance and for fun just follow him untill he notices me and then i shoot him and go to another building.Con Flaw: Why is it that everytime I get near a building the Griz magically appears, Seems like bad scripts to me. I have yet to have a bear act up on me untill I am within sight of my new building. Then I have to sprint to the building and hide until he passes my exit.Also do not try to shoot the griz when you are in what I call the comfort zone (in or too close to certain buildings that the griz will or shall i say is programmed not to come near.) The only shots that can hit the Griz must be out of comfort zone and in some cases far away from buildings.All in all I dont knock games for flaws. I will still play Griz project just due to the difficulty it has atm. I also like seeing the dev using unity as there engine because thats what Ive been using, I dont feel this is a cash grab but the devs definatly have more faith in there creation than I can put out for mine so I have respect for that. I fear creating another knock off of a game and have put several month's just into my story line not including classing up on and matching unity and others into a growing nightmare of a game from the mind of an 80's kid."

They should really allow you to hold more too."

,Recommended,461520,25837942,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,BrupcatBR,"Grizzly Valley is an open world first-person survival thriller game developed and published by Kiddy in April 23rd, 2016. Starting off this review, the game runs fairly decently, and it looks decent aswell. The concept is solid, but with an atmosphere like this, they could've made a concept that would go much more into how creepy the game would be, since the atmosphere is so god damn fantastic. The game doesn't offer much in content. It's a Survival game, but like i said, it's a thriller. I wouldn't consider it a survival horror game, though. The game doesn't have much to offer but i'd still recommend it very well. Also, music is creepy as all hell.9.0/10 ~Atmosphere creeped me out enough for me to get diarrhea."

,Not Recommended,461520,22668442,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,swix,"When I first launched the game I encountered what was supposed to be a main menu screen, but there were no options, I was just staring at a car dashboard inside of a blender. The fix I found for this was deleting the save files and redownloading the game.Once you get in the game, you're in a house, you gather supplies to go out to look for car batteries in a forest full of deadly bears that don't give a pickle about your bullets, If it were me, I'd go to a walmart instead, despite it being about the same amount of dangerous, I'd just run in circles drinking cokes to get away from the lady on the motorised scooter.Oh look, a bear. *ded*I didn't explore the whole map, because the bears were not very happy with me trying to take their car batteries, but what I did see was a bunch of empty buildings with nothing in them, oh yeah and one building with a table that had a radio on it, and that was about the most exciting thing that happened.You can sprint for about 3 seconds and then you're tired, so you gotta chug 10 cans of coke so you can run 2 feet.I'm quite certain If I saw a grizzly bear, I'd make a mess in my pants and then run until my lungs imploded and created a black hole.Really can't recommend this game as there's nothing to do besides running around hiding from ninja bears.It's pretty much the same concept as slender man, which hasn't been overused at all, right?Oh, but you get to pick items that will prove to be completely useless."
76561198062557275,Recommended,461520,24381793,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,The Vegan,"After putting in over 800 hours into this game's predecessor, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, this game plays with the gameplay mechanics a bit while still retaining the good feel of victory after each hunt.Like the other games in the series, the main gameplay focuses around your character hunting monsters, with the key focus of avoiding their attacks and attacking at opportune moments between their attacks, often times hitting their weak points for massive damage. And, like every game in the series, you can't heal and attack super quickly; you need to get out of the way of an incoming attack and heal, then continue avoiding attacks until the opportune moment to strike.There's a smaller weapon variety in this game, but each weapon is still unique in how it plays, as how you attack with each weapon slightly differs, so I'm glad they retained that feature. Another feature that's also in this game is the limited inventory space, so you have to manage your inventory as you progress; you can't hold everything, after all.One thing I'm sort of iffy about is the limited hunter rank; in the previous game, it was 999, but in this game it's only 20. This makes it much easier to cap your rank, and it doesn't feel as rewarding, but the grind it takes to get there is a lot quicker so I guess that's a plus.Perhaps the best part of the entire franchise is that the main 'large monsters' get their own battle theme, and this game is no exception, providing intense battle music for the two flagship boss monsters, as well as the usual recurring map theme for regular hunts.One mechanic that I abused greatly seemed to have been removed until the final boss, and that is the popular tactic known as sleep bombing; towards endgame, you're given the only weapon with the sleeping status effect. Nothing quite satisfies like putting the monster to sleep then destroying it with one devastating unseen strike to finish it off.All in all, this game plays quite differently than the other Monster Hunter games, but still retains many of its core features and that's why I recommend it. It has significantly less content than the other Monster Hunter games, but it's also significantly cheaper so it balances out nicely."
