,Recommended,461560,29697892,Posted: 4 February,all,Audish,"It's always bittersweet to find a free game that you want more of. Such is the case with Mandagon, a 2D exploration game set in a Tibetan vision of limbo. You don't know why you're there or what you're doing or why you're a cheeful-looking stone head that can jump, but all will be revealed as you wander the serene temples and ruins of this magical place. There's no real puzzling to do, other than sussing out the story from the cryptic rhymes shared by ancient statues, but the exploration is more than enough to keep you engaged for as long as it lasts.The heart of Mandagon's appeal is its environment and atmosphere, which would be remarkable even for a full-priced game. The graphics are finely-detailed pixel art, showing off every crack and bit of moss on stones and every groove in the pillars holding the place aloft. You'll start your adventure in a stony valley of pools and cliff dwellings, but soon your adventure will take you to etherial ruins floating in the sky, their banners and wind chimes tossing gently in the breeze. With no enemies to harangue you and no challenging platforming to speak of, the art turns Mandagon into a peaceful trek across a gorgeous and fantastic world.It's not a big world, of course, and you should be able to see all its sights in 30 minutes or so. Your goal is to place six tablets back in their proper places, and there aren't a whole lot of places where they could be hidden. The arches where the tablets must be placed also serve as the fast travel points, making it easy to get back to where you need to be at any time. You won't find any abilities or upgrades, just shortcuts to activate and one special travel method high up in the ruins. There are a few little secrets tucked away that also build on the excellent atmosphere as well.The story's not bad but it's told in terribly vague terms, so unless you want to really puzzle out the rhymes you'll just be here for the journey. And it's an absolutely lovely, imaginative journey for the short time it lasts, so there's no reason not to give it a go if you like exploring. This feels like a title for people who loved the Knytt games, because it definitely pushes a lot of the same buttons for me. Here's hoping Mandagon's creators are hard at work on a full game, because this little slice of heaven left me hungry for more.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

It's rarer that these games are free.Mandagon is a short experience, but if you ever find yourself with an hour in the afternoon, let yourself enjoy the serene soundtrack and find your way through the temple door."

,Not Recommended,461560,29859783,Posted: 11 February,all,Maxmetpt,"The game is really, really beautiful, as you can see from the screenshots!Even though it looks a bit crude (looks jagged in movement, some patterns seem a bit flattened, etc.), there are tons of intricate patterns I really like!The music is a bit strange, with some details I enjoyed (the birds and bells, for example), but I wasn't aware of it, for the most part. So yeah, wasn't good nor bad, for me.The game itself is the worst part, since, despite a beautiful and rather large ""world"" (the game is short, it's only ""large"" in the context of a single room/level), it's just about jumping on platforms and using lifts to get to several tablets spread around the game.The platforming isn't challenging at all (you're quite slow in the air), and most of the jumps are very forgiving, giving you a fair window for error.There are no mechanics at all, other than a single jump.So yeah, you can imagine it being very stale. It's just about moving around, with the most basic movement system you could think of.The only challenge here is orientation, since the game only lets you see the map in specific spots, so you can get lost, or miss something and forgetting where it might have been.The other aspect I should mention is the whole ""Tibetan theology/philosophy"". I think what they wanted to say was ""imagery"", because there's nothing meaningful about philosophy or theology here. And nothing apparently that relates to a particular way of thinking.There are some cryptic lines spread around the game, but you never have to use or understand them. So... no.Maybe there are some environmental clues I'm missing? Maybe... but even if there are, they're completely isolated from the *game*, making them irrelevant.If it was just about imagery, well... they should set different expectations in the description, I guess.The game isn't too bad, and it's free, so nothing's stopping you from giving you a go.I just didn't find anything interesting in it aside from the art-style, so I'll give it a no.I'm interested in their future projects regardless! With more experience, something better may come!"

You figure things out on your own.The OST matches the creepy vibe.All in all, a great f2p game. 8/10."
76561198164129085,Recommended,461560,29823715,Posted: 10 February,all,nero,"To summarize things: Mandagon is - in my opinion - a beautifully made game with a lot of thought and heart put into it.ART - 9.5/10I love, love, love pixel art, so I am probably biased, but I thought the art in this game was amazing. There is so much detail and I enjoyed every little bird, plant, the shrines, the big temple, the houses, the water, the snow ... should I go on? It has a very distinct Tibetan touch and it makes you feel like you got teleported into a little pixel Himalayan region. It's absolutely beautiful.MUSIC - 8/10The music sounded ominous and a little disharmonic and spooky, but kinda ... ethereal? I found it to be very fitting in regards to the place and the story.STORY - 8/10The more wisdom totems you speak to, the better you can figure out what's going on. I do not want to spoil anything for anyone, but there is symbolism around to help you understand too (the six big murals/pictures on the walls as you ascend in an elevator) and if you pay a little attention to any of the totems, the ending of the game will make you go 'ahh, I knew it was about xy'. It's not very hard to follow but nice to figure out imo. I enjoyed it and it fit the atmosphere and feeling of the game.CONTROLS - 7/10Some people are whining about how hard and unforgiving the jumps are, but I found them to be very forgiving and only messed up one jump in ~60 minutes of playing and found them to be pretty forgiving. Besides the 'tricky jumping', the controls were easy to adapt to.Suggestions/bugs:Controller optimaziton was a little messed up as both X and A made you jump, although X was supposed to be the action button, so it made taking elevators pretty much impossible as you would just jump instead of ride, over and over again. Additionally, if you weren't holding down on right or left while taking one of the glowing elevators, it would take you up and then down again, without letting you get off.Definitely play with keyboard and mouse!OVERALL - 8/10It's pretty, it's relaxing, it's only about an hour long, and well, it's free! I found it well worth the time and was actually a bit sad it was so short. I will be buying the DLC because I enjoyed the game a lot and I'd love to see some more games by Blind Sky Studios."
76561198112866114,Recommended,461560,29494345,Posted: 25 January,all,kyzka,"Mandagon (mantis/panda/dragon) teleports you straight away to a Tibetan Buddhist concept known as 'Bardo' a limbo place between death and rebirth. Buddhists mainly believe that if you do good deeds you get rebirthed into a higher lifeform or do bad deeds and your soul will get rebirthed into a lower life form.The objective of the game is to simply find six keys and a number of totems (optional) and open the big door where you will find a 'god' who will then cast his vote. The totems give you back ground information as to your background story as you can't tell much just by looking at yourself since you look like an Aztec version of pacman.Tom Kitchen the main designer behind this game, suffered a family loss in death and looking through various answers though he is not a religious man himself found 'some' comfort in the Tibetan book of the dead and it's the information from that which gives you the background information to your game character as well as to what may have helped Tom get through his grieving process and helped him to move on with his life.Since morality is an integral part of all of our lives, improving ourselves, being our better self, ascension will at some point play an essential role in both our needs and desires. Likewise this game is all about ascension, moving up (forward) to find answers. Tom Kitchen is all for 'exploring' concepts of an afterlife. Unfortunately only one concept is displayed in this game and I would have been equally impressed if the game went onto explore other concepts, Mormon, Hindu, JW, Catholic, Atheist, phansigar. Maybe that could be a sequel. But the game does do more than just explore afterlife, it also explores the concept of what sacrifice really means too.While this is a free game there is also some DLC available for purchase. It consists of one soundtrack, some art concepts that never made it into the game and finally it places the totem poem in its correct order so it makes sense.I appreciate that Tom Kitchen was able to move forward as I also looked into Buddhism and read the 'book of the dead', but personally I was never able to get my head around one thing. I haven't always been a good person, so there is always a good chance according to their beliefs that I could come back as a lower life form. Ok fair enough. I have come to appreciate that things like stealing, lying, murder is bad. So here is my question. How can one be a good crocodile or a bad crocodile? Once you started going down in life forms surely you’re doomed!?A free game that offers an interesting self-meditation on one's morality.

The main goal of the game is to find six tablets scattered around the map and take them to specific spots, in order to unlock a giant door. What I find interesting about this game is that it's really atmospheric, with a great art style, and a nice soundtrack, all of which combines to provide a really soothing experience.The game itself is really short, but I'd say that's good for what it's trying to achieve, so I recommend it."
76561198327690500,Recommended,461560,29579172,Posted: 29 January,all,viewing.cherry.blossoms,"At first glance the game seems like it would be a letdown - You're thrown into the world of MANDAGON with little explanation as to why you are, how you are, or which microscopically small pixels are YOU. Yet it's easy to warm to MANDAGON quickly, despite the chilly-looking landscape. The game map is small, and the game itself can be completed in well under an hour, but it handles that scale well. The gameplay is just diverse enough to keep you interested, and makes sure to end things at just the right time instead of dragging or cutting too early. Likewise, the music and artstyle aren't particularly flashy - but everything is where it needs to be, which makes for a simple, yet enjoyable experience.If I had to think of any cons to this game, it would be inconsistent controlling, especially around the water areas for some odd reason. But that's a nitpick at worst.I'd highly recommend this game to anyone interested. (Especially since it's free.)"

I really like the art direction and hope to see more from them in the future. Sadly an exploration game like this has very little replay value, so it's really just very short.

,Recommended,461560,29567899,Posted: 29 January,all,Aurelie Nix,"Ahh the beauty of Indie games. 2016 has been an incredible year for me in terms of Indie games I have had the chance to find and play, both old and recent. The games I have played throughout 2016 had helped remind me time and time again of my passionate love for video games and my never ending search for the next story.Although released in 2016, Mandagon was the indie game that started 2017 for me, and oh boy was it one hell of a beautiful game!Created by developer Blind Sky Studios, a small UK games studio composed of four coffee loving people, Mandagon is a short and free indie, adventure and pixel styled game inspired by Tibetan theology and philosophy, in which the focus is Bardo, the Tibetan word or version for “Limbo”.In Mandagon you play as a sort of statue or part of a totem, and you explore and climb a sort of temple, in which you are given samples of a story about a man, his daughter, and a choice. Although Mandagon is quite straightforward in its gameplay and purpose, a rather simple and not particularly challenging gameplay of hopping your way to the top and around to access the inside of a temple, the mystery of the story is what will give you the desire to keep hoping, to find out what is on the other side, and, ultimately, what will make you keep thinking about Mandagon even after you are finished with its story.There are also two other elements of Mandagon that caught my attention and still has it, the aesthetic of the game and its soundtrack. Although simplistic at first glance, Mandagon is an incredibly gorgeous game in which I encourage you to stop at times and observe your surroundings. See how tapestries move with the wind, the birds flapping their winds, and every other sparkle of color and detail that were a very welcomed surprised for a free game. The soundtrack of Mandagon was also a surprise. A single 22 minute composition seemingly designed for you to meditate your way through the universe, the story and the game, with themes of contemplation and sacrifice. Though available for free on steam at the moment, a digital art book, soundtrack and extras are available as a package for 4.43$ on steam, which I highly recommend not only because it’s awesome, but because I truly believe that Mandagon has too much to offer to be a free game.In the hour or so that I spent in its universe, surrounded by its music and its themes or death, life, purpose and sacrifice, Mandagon gave me more than hours and hours long game have been giving me: it gave me an experience.10/10 – Will purchase the art and OST package, and would purchase anytime if it means putting my money where it belongs, in the pocket of true artists."

,Not Recommended,461560,29817505,Posted: 9 February,all,Helen Keller,"It's chill and Zen and whatnot, but... it reminds me too much of those side-scrollers on the Nintendo growing up. The ones I could never beat because I didn't have good enough hand-eye coordination.I want to like it. I don't care for the music, but it seems like a game where you just kinda figure stuff out as you go along. And apparently the game is beatable in ~30 minutes. As I have put over an hour into this, I seem to be one of those folks who can't figure out ""obvious"" methods (probably by using Youtube or whatnot). But it also frustrates me. You can access the map at specific points, but after my last fall from a really high-up point where I missed one stupid jump onto a thin podium out of about 57, and then thought I could land on something but then saw I couldn't and tried to land on something else... and I basically fell from the top left of the map to the complete bottom. Into water. And I really had no idea how to find another map area, or get back to where I was.Pros: Cool theme, chill ideas, I'd probably put more if I owned a Nintendo growing up and didn't rely on my 3 minutes of fail before I died and handed the controller to my friend who owned it til (s)he died... which was like 30+ minutes later.Cons: The music clangs, and I really don't care enough to bother to understand what's going on here. I've found the game too frustrating with the lack of anything specified (I mean ffs, I'm a block of stone, why not just sit there?). Weird (and possibly disturbing) pictures of lungs. Cryptic messages that go over my head. And I'm not even blonde -- though I suspect that I just can't get into the game to care enough. Maybe it's because I don't do mind-altering/recreational/illegal substances?Overall, hey it's free, the graphics are kinda cool (as is the map), the idea isn't half bad, and for a game beatable in under 30 minutes, it's already taken over an hour of my life. So I guess it's okay... but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it without a huge disclaimer: if you want to figure out a game that's chill with no real purpose aside from traipsing around Tibet with monks giving you cryptic rhymes... then do it!That, and my recommendation would be based on the person I am talking to.3/10"

Played well with a controller. Did not have issues with getting stuck on any surfaces and was able to easily locate and land jumps using the thumbstick. Music was pretty cool as well. Went fast at under an hour to play.

It looks and plays like a bonus level from Fez (minus the surprise 3D mechanic), with a darker overarching theme - the world is meant to portray the Tibetan idea of the afterlife. If you like side scrollers or Tibetan philosophy - go right ahead and play this!"
,Recommended,461560,29463368,Posted: 24 January,all,kolosoff,Sweet meditative game with amazing art style for a pixelated sidescroller. Some of the text in game has quite deep meaning if you are into spiritual things.
,Recommended,461560,29453172,Posted: 23 January,all,DataRecoveryMan,"An extremely minimal platformer with less of a ""puzzle"" factor than a find-and-return mechanic.  The world graphics are really neat, packed with detail. The soundtrack is ambient and a little creepy, but also pretty flat.  Neat ""story"" hidden in there.  Definitely worth the 40 minutes it took to check it out."

A quick and peaceful game that isn't hard and isn't easy, it gives you your own reign over the area to do whatever fits your fancy. You can achievment hunt, look for lore, or go for completeing it. My favorite parts were that it was a nice bite size game and I really dig the aesthetic of the game as a whole. I want to learn more about the small world they built!I would absolutely recommend this game, it's free and really nice if you have a couple ten minutes to spare on something unique. Personally, I wouldn't mind paying a dollar or two even though its short, its a neat game."

76561198124553963,Recommended,461560,29508265,Posted: 26 January,all,Mr.Peabody,"Mandagon is a perfect example of how heart and story can carry a game. Games aren't great because of their graphics, gore, fantasy, etc... but because of the story they tell. This game tells a very complex story simply and lets the player discover what is going piece by piece causing them to want to continue playing to learn about the character. This heart and storytelling is an aspect of gaming that I would like to see more of. With advances in technology many developers have relied on graphical content to carry their games, but completely forgot about the reason why we should play their game. Games have evolved into a medium for storytelling and this game proves that you can successfully get a message across without fancy asthetics and long drawn out quick time events. It also shows (by the already overwhelmingly positive reviews) that gamers want to care about their characters and the story they tell. I hope to see more games like this in the future and would love to see this developer's future projects."

Think the beauty and symbolism of Hyperlight Drifter, but with a more relaxing atmosphere and more puzzle solving and less stressful fumbling of controls. Beautiful art and soundtrack-the story that unfolds as you are given enlightening advice by totems are also a nice touch.It is a great game to just sit back, relax and chill with."

76561198162994148,Recommended,461560,29705752,Posted: 4 February,all,Laser of Holy Might,It's your average platformer that's decent and short. I feel that the main strength of the game in general is the art and the atmosphere because the gameplay is rather unoriginal.Still recommend to play it though. It's short enough to enjoy.
