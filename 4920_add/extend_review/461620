It's not nearly as detailed or in-depth as the old City Builders, but it's not pretending to be (or even trying). What it does, it does well.Pros: Pleasing art style and visuals; gentle learning process; good attention to historical detail (where possible); fun sense of progression and growth from tiny group of hunters to political powerhouse.Cons: cluttered UI, that isn't always easy to follow; objectives/missions sometimes not explained very clearly. Minor issues, really.8/10"

For the price I paid (US$8), I am quite happy with my purchase, but am disappointed that I won't be playing much more of it.EDIT: Having replayed this game since a MAJOR UPDATE, many of the issues I had detailed below have been fixed.My experiences and criticisms are set out below:I found myself identifying with many of the challenges faced by another reviewer (Saint Ceo de la Vegas), where in both my playthorughs, I started the game on easy, and in that setting I found the challenges within the ""settlement screen"" difficult, but achievable. I managed to unite my region, amass (what I thought was) a substantial army, was constructing buildings quickly and in line with technological advances.However, as soon the game shifted to an Egypt-wide emphasis (""fog of war map""), any progress I had made seemed woefully limited. The challenges to build, explore, unite and fight cities were just too substantial.I completely shifted all production to military in order to attempt to build an army that could come close to taking on Seth (or at least defend myself against Seth, which I was able to do), but still couldn't come close to having enough soldiers for this. I was able to unite 4 or 5 tribes at this level, build a 3k + strong army, but I never felt in a position to even confront the smallest Seth settlement.I was totally unable to build several of the special tombs due to lack of exploration at this point (despite having more than enough workers and resources) ... it just came down to timing and exploration, I wasn't fast enough and the game punished me for it, this can be good and bad.In this case however, I felt that even if I had sped up my style of play and succeeded in building the tombs, I wouldn't have been able to challenge Seth militarily anyway, and this was confirmed in my second playthough.I want to qualify this review by saying I enjoyed the game and would recommend it.In reaction to the developer: I do not think a special mode needs to be created to make the game ""much easier"". I'd suggest within the current easy mode, just reduce scouting times, and reduce the size of a few of the enemy armies (or make building armies faster/easier... for instance instead of +6 soldiers on a site, make it +12, or whatever)."
76561198021763496,Not Recommended,461620,33053903,Posted: 30 June,all,Ratmannf,"This is a fun game. But three things break it:1. The extremely tight turn limit to achieve victory even on the easiest difficulty2. The lack of gameplay flexibility to explore alternative strategies because of 1, leading to scripted gameplay where you must follow a fixed path to victory or lose3. Random negative events that happen anytime, aggravating 1. and 2.I don't think this game was properly tested on all difficulties. It recommends new players try the easiest difficulty, yet lacks the flexibility for the slightest margin of error even at that difficulty. Even those who manage to complete it on the hardest difficulty can only explain a single way to beat the game. They are unable to explain how to exploit different strategies to achieve victory even though the game gives the impression of such ""flexibility"" through a diverse tech tree and wide selection of building improvements. This is because the very short turn limit to achieve victory, coupled with arbitrary (by this I mean untested on all difficulties) victory requirements, negates such a notion.Many available techs and building improvements could not be researched/built in my attempt to meet the victory requirements because of the short turn limit. For example, the tech point requirement for every subsequent tech scales up as part of the progression mechanic and the second last tech just before the victory tech costs 5000 tech points. This is fine in itself except that the victory tech itself costs 45000 tech points, which is a sudden ninefold jump in tech requirements and appears extremely arbitrary just to make the game ""challenging"" without proper testing on all difficulties as mentioned. Note that I proritized spending tech points only on techs that allow me to reach this victory tech in as short a path as possible to avoid wasting points on unnecessary techs. I also put a high priority to allocating workers on tiles that give huge tech point bonuses each turn and frequently played options that gave tech bonuses. Yet the game ended when I only had around half the required tech points needed for victory.In other words, you have to play by the script or lose due to the lack of margin for error even on the easiest difficulty as explained earlier. Do not get me wrong. I like challenging games. But if the challenges do not scale according to the difficulty and are not tested for this, and scripted gameplay is forced on the player to win, there's really nothing to look forward to in the game in terms of replayability. This game is just worth a few hours of entertainment and no more than that."

It is not really a game per se as the devs have put so much history into it and built a framework of 'play' that makes this more of a re-enactment than a normal free flowing game. Whilst I don't regret my purchase, I can't see myself playing this for long (I've actually had enough now at 16hrs, or coming back to it in the short term) because it has one overwhelmingly terminal flaw for me. So, the pros and cons:Pro's:Looks nice enough for what it is (a computerised board game is a good description), but it's clean, crisp and nice to look at.Super easy to use interface and easy to pick up what you need to do.Hard to master what you need to do (this is also a negative, see below).Price, for €9, can't go wrong can you ???It's stable, I had no glitches, freezes, CTD and/or bugs I could see.The map randomises a little so most villages and resources may move around which mixes things up a little.The game creates an environment where you have to carefully balance a number of resources and the actual balance point of the mix varies alot throughout the game.You cannot 'win' this game by sitting back, building up a mega-blob army of wonder warriors and then blitzing the Nile valley in the last 5 turns, you actually have to think about things.Con's:Only one really - it's linear gameplay. You have many options and things to do on any given turn, but if you want to complete the challenges with their strict and short time limits (that always appear on the same game turn each game) you basically have to follow an optimal path to victory - if you wander off this path even a little for more than a few turns - challenges failed. Each challenge failed you incur a penalty or lose a bonus that then makes the rest of the game incrementally more difficult. So pressure is on to not fail ANY challenges.Foreknowledge of challenges is often required to accomplish them - for example you must know that soon you will be asked to build a certain building in a certain location. That location is occupied by a friendly but neutral village. It takes 5 turns to convince them to join you (assuming you have the insane resource needed) or 5 turns to raid them and then another 5 to attack and kill them, plus of course the 5 turns to build the building while the challenge gives you 7 turns to do this - maybe you'll get lucky and a god will help out a little, but basically you needed to be ready to go beforehand, having stayed in that optimal linear position (pre-explored the right area and pre-dealt with the village and stockpiled or be producing enough resource to build the building), in order to accomplish this challenge.Naturally I messed it up the first time through, but each subsequent run down the same path lets you get more familiar with it and hence further down the path before you stumble and fall. Not usually a good thing in gaming.In short - yeah it's a good casual strategy game, gets you thinking and stressing over what to do next so I do recommend it especially for the price. I am guessing you'll probably play it a few times until you 'win' , then walking down the same path for yet another 200 turns to do the same things at the same time in largely the same regions will lose it's appeal."
,Recommended,461620,25999514,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,Dr. Strangelove,"One of the best games I've played recently, it has a very good money-to-value ratio.It reminds me of Pharaoh and Cleopatra, but on an entirely different scale - you start as a small tribe of several hunter-gatherers and gradually you shift to a more advanced society, creating first religions, alphabets, assimilating or killing other tribes - this is a wonderful experience for anyone who likes pre-civiliazation era.Once your settlement is large enough, you will proceed to create a proto-state and then a true state. This requires a lot of skill and cunning, and diplomacy and very careful resource allocation is a must.One word of advice - expand north, FAST, or else you're screwed. Ignore your enemies and they will grow in numbers in no time.Some cons now:1. The replayability value is lower because there is no randomly generated map - you will start in the same place, with the same resources and the same tribes. Not exactly the best feature.2. Personally, I'd like to see some more diplomatic options - marriages, alliances, little more detail about how faith is spread etc.Despite the cons, I can heartily recommend it. It is a very good game, and has a good price too."

I failed about a quarter of the events.  But now that I know what to expect, it should be a lot easier.  Fortunately, there are multiple options for increasing the difficulty.The replayability doesn't come from random maps, but rather from improving your performance on each set event and finally winning the game.  To me, it feels more like a ""let's do better this time"" game rather than a ""what will happen this time"" game.  And that's quite alright by me.But the graphics and music are entirely fitting for the setting.  The music never got annoying.  Everything was easy to identify and the UI worked well.  I particularly liked the interludes that gave detail on certain events or places relevant to Egyptian history.If you're interested in this time period, you'll have fun and maybe learn something.  If you're an expert on this time period, please let me know if the game got anything wrong."

,Recommended,461620,28597118,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,wgren,"It’s like a simplified Civilization with a single civ and a single scenario based on real history, and a hand-drawn map. Drag workers to the places that give the most resources (workers aren’t expended like in Civ), build improvements, conquer or unite other tribes. I find it less stressful than civ for some reason. You are unlikely to get conquered on easier levels, but you may fail the endgame unless you manage to unify all the 15 tribes along the Nile, build a new capital city, unify the religions and hold a great feast (each subgoal requiring several thousands of one the 4 basic resources) by turn 220. You can play through it once in one evening, and then try a harder difficulty next time.Highly recommended. It made me long for the old Ceasar and Pharao games through."

And one that requires you to simply know all scripted events and trails and prepare for them. There are few things that are random, including combat. In other games that increases re-playability but here it might make following optimal path no longer possible. If you don't get ""gold"" from trial you don't get associated bonuses and it will be hard to complete next goals.Other miscellaneous stuff:- horizontal scroll in technology & save windows is annoying- fields don't have fixed production, some buildings not only increase but replace production and it is hard to tell exactly what (and where) will happen. Even worse, some of those changes are triggered by scouting/turn progress (at least it looks that way)- it is hard to estimate ""+x%"" bonuses impact, it seems like result is rounded up instead of nearest integer.TL;DR: it is a mix of typical worker placement boardgame (like Agricola) with original Homeworld campaign style( do mission perfectly or you will hit impassable wall in future)."

This game is more of the same, but slightly bigger, differently but better done (big improvement imho!) and still destroys you the first time you play it. I've completed my first game in exactly 90 minutes, and got a score of 1/35 ... Yeah, it destroyed me.The game plays out in an overhead view where you start as a small tribe of Egyptians (or nomads whatever) as you create and form ancient Egypt. You use food to ""purchase"" workers who you then allocate to farm, fish, mine, pray, train soldiers or build buildings (you need production for this). As you grow bigger & explore, you meet different tribes who can be aggressive/hostile, neutral or friendly towards you. You can chose to subdue, unite your tribes, trade, etc... You also have some other resources you use to progress in culture and gain additional bonusses for 3 turns.Just like their previous game, this game is marked in ""checkpoint"" or events that happen based on how far you've progressed in time. It is up to you to make sure you're ready and get a gold, silver, or bronzen rating (3-2-1 points resp.). You probably won't be prepared for the first time, but that's alright, most events just make you fail and continue the game, unless your tribe gets conquered and subued!It's a small, highly replayable game for a mere 8 euro's (or 9 when the promotion ended) that I surely will enjoy for many more hours! If you're into (meagre) city building, growing, battling tribes, overcoming difficulties such as floods, sand storms, enemy tribes and the unification of Egypt, and much more, I say give this game a go!As final remark, I would like to congratiulate Clarus Victoria on this small but fun and great game, which I also haven't encountered any bugs at all in. I like how this company is seemingly always trying to make their games bigger, more fun, dare to change things up a bit and still able to maintain a relative low cost of purchase. Well done Clarus Victoria!"

There is a turnlimit before you lose so every game will end at some point if you do not manage to win earlier.One playthrough will take maybe around 2h.Strategic Aspect:While it might not sound very promising up to this point you can easily play it a couple of times without getting bored. There are several strategic ways to progress further into the campaign and all of them have their strenghths and weaknesses and will guide you in a bit different manner through the game. Do you want to focus more on military and technology or do you want strong economics and be in favor with the gods? Its your choice.Depending on your playstyle and difficulty setting the game can be hard.I played it 3 times to the end and failed 2 times (2nd time I would have won just a single turn after the game ended in a defeat). All 3 plays were pretty different after the starting phase.Sound, Graphics & Atmosphere:The graphics, while simple, are nicely done and fitting and so are sound and  music.It has pleasing flair that will grab you and put in the right mood for such a game.I would see this as a strongpoint of the game.Historic Aspect:If you have the desire you can learn a bit from this game. I tries to show you the development of ancient Egypt and can teach you a couple of cool things if you are willing to listen.A nice bonus for me.Summary:This is no Blockbuster or AAA title and it tries not to be one. If you are into history, ancient cultures or simply if its on sale and you want to try a bit of a different strategy/building/management game, this can be the right game for you.I picked it up in a sale and while I have only played like 6 hours I would see my money well invested.I am pretty sure that I will play it at some point later on if I am in the right mood again.That for less money than eating out a in a fast food restaurant? Yeah sure - I will take it."

Well, lets cut it throught, it is absolutly worth buying.The game is actually very accurate on historical facts (for the much we know on the egyptian era). You walk throught the game and you wonder if you can believe and learn from what it gives you, well do not worry, you can totally learn from it.You play or played games where you wonder what kind of button is this or that and what it does? Well you don't need to puzzle it out now because the gameplay is not needlessly complex but also no too much easy. You would totally drag fun from this one.The artwork is awesome, seriously, they did a great job with it, and the animations are very beautiful and well articulated. I was quite impressed by that last one.Anyway, in my opinion, this game is worth its 9.99$, even if not in sale.

On beginner's difficulty, this game is almost insultingly easy--and a playthrough shouldn't take you more than 1-1.5 hours to beat. Where is gets hard is when you start taking off the training wheels. It's hard to say what gives this game so much replayability--the maps are more or less the same and outside of some unexpected events, you'll be playing the same thing every time. Yet the more you play, the more you realize how every. single. tiny. action will have repercussions down the road. You'll have to start preparing for events several turns ahead of you, and even after you've played through a few times and you know what's coming, it's surprisingly tricky to actually prepare properly to actually avoid things cleanly.I've put in a solid number of hours in this game and I still haven't been able to win on difficult with all of the achievements, and that's saying something considering how deceptively easy it felt in the beginning. Definitely give this game a shot, at the very least it will be a very engaging few hours."

Well apart from being turn-bases, the fact that you have to manage your workers and have to develop new tech, the game does its own thing. It also has elements of the old city builder series like Pharaoh. But its more about recreating Hierakonpolis as it was. That means you don't get that much agency over where the farms, temples etc gets to be placed. It's not a sandbox game like that of Pharaoh. You are more guided by historical accuracy when it comes to that. But since I am a big history nerd too I quite like it.the core of the game is going through the trials of developing Hierakonpolis, first as a small tribal village and then gradually scouting out and developing the area around the city. Hereby making it a hub for farming, worship, craftsmen and the training of your army. Later a map for whole Egypt opens op.On this map you explore even more and deal with other tribes; trading with them, persuading them to join you or crushing them with your army.Most of you time are spent on managing your workers. moving them from farming to for instance worship when you need the favour of a god to overcoming a trial/mission more easily. The main goal is to unite the tribes of Egypt, creating a single pantheon and the society that the dynasties of the Pharaohs would rule.the good things:- interesting historical setting that is incredibly well researched.- the small animations of your workers, that look like old paintings from Egyptian tombs coming to life is incredibly well made. It makes the game look a lot more lively. It's almost a metaphor for the core of the game: bringing Egypt's history to life- Challenges that require you to think and balance food, culture, production and getting new tech. As well as taking over other tribes or focusing on internal deveopment of your capital city.the features that could use improvement:- Combat. Currently, it's mostly a numbers game. The ones with the strongest army in terms of numbers wins. There are small battle events that can happen like ""the enemy attacks from an ambush!"" which is just written in text, nothing the player can do influence about it. I understand that combat is not the main feature of the game but it would be cool with more agency to the player in combat. Being able to choose tactics (like feint, hit-and-run, all-out attack etc) would be an improvement.- Worker management; being able to at the click of a button to prioritise workers to different resources.  it can be a bit much having to manage every work individually.Overall a great little indie game with great potential for a sequel - and it's cheap in price too!"

,Recommended,461620,34336295,Posted: 18 August,all,Quetzalcoatl,"Overall vote: 7.5Nice educational, unpretentious strategic without the depth or replaiability of other similar games like Civilization.The historical aspect of the game is marvelously made, and it's its best selling point: if you like history and especially Egyptian history, you will enjoy the game and the various informations contained in it.Regarding the game itself, it's a different story: Predynastic Egypt is a turn-based strategy game more similar to a board game like Risk/Risiko than a proper video game like Civilization: you merely move your workers on the map, deciding  which type of resources they have to work, and that's it.Sure, it lacks the depth of other strategic games, but it's still a very nice, unpretentious game.It's not for everyone, though: Predynastic Egypt can be very difficult (the tutorial is extremely short and doesn't fully prepare for what lies ahead) and unforgiving; on the higher difficulties, that means that you'll have to follow some precise strategies to ensure victory, severely limiting your game freedoom.And this is perhaps the game's biggest flaw: freedom and repleability. The game (logically) takes place always on the same map, with the same starting position, the same trials, the same victory conditions and the same terrain yeldfor every single campaign(also every game will always see the same number of tribes, albeit randomized in position, goods and attitude, and the randomized events will always happen on the same turns), meaning that you'll need to adopt always the same strategies to win. leaving very, [very] limited space for creativity and improvisation.Despite this burdensome flaw, I still reccomend this game for history enthusiasts or for everyone who wants to spend some hours with a relaxing and educational game."

,Recommended,461620,29486382,Posted: 25 January,all,Pinkjot,"Got this game during Steam sale. It's a turn based puzzle game with story background covering ancient Egypt. It may look very simplistic but once you start playing it, you find lots of in-game features.Your goal is to build up your initial colony and explore nearby areas. This is done by acquiring citizens and placing them to various free slots across the map, each one giving you different resources. Soon, during the gameplay, different buildings and cultures are presented to you, both of which giving you various perks that help improve your colony. Once your initial area gets fully explored, your next goal is to discover whole Egypt. During this phase of the game, military and trading becomes more of a priority, since more tribes start appearing to you. Establishing strong alliances, conquering areas and dealing with many random events (some are good, some are bad) are key factors for achieving unification of Egypt - game victory.While the game is short and may get repetitive fairly quickly, it still offers an interesting story of colonization of Egypt and a variety of different game mechanics. In my opinion, the achievements are well made and give the game the much needed replayability value. I'm currently 40 hours into the game and still struggling to get them all. This means, you need to pick all kinds of strategies to perfect this game 100%.Overall, it's a solid little game for the price. The learning curve may be difficult at first, but it's still fun once you get a grasp of it.

This game is akin to Civilization, but unlike Civ, you don't get tied in micromanagement - instead they use the Toynbee model of historical development: you get a new historical challenge from time to time (form a tribe, hold out against the followers of another agressive Egyptian deity, find a route to the Middle East to build a pyramid, etc.) and overcoming those challenges is essentially winning.Yeah, you get to do some resource management and construction planning, but the big picture and overall historical landscape is far more important and weighing your decisions is likely to take more of your time than implementing them - no driving throngs of stack of units around the map, no conquering gazillions of enemy cities or building up tonnes of units to defend your many cities. Everything's more laid back, schematic and easy to manage, grand strategy style.The overall look and feel is similar to that of PCMA, but I'd say it looks like that only on the surface - the whole gameplay (religion, minor tribes, combat) are very different and I'd say improved. What both games have in common is the pre-determined historical flow of events and the depth of detail - they call it ""story-rich"" nowadays - you really feel that you are making history here, from the first farm to the first Mastaba. While some local tribes and starting conditions are randomized, the game itself is not random - you WILL follow the path of the Egyptian civilization. Or die trying.All in all, I love these two games because they manage to be educational without actually being boring as hell, like most of these types do, not to mention that they require attention to detail, thinking and planning. Easy to learn the basics, they are quite difficult to beat - so replayability is very high.From my prospective, this developer has some serious potential. This game is fresh, it's not like anything else I've seen recently. Highly recommended."

76561198136712465,Recommended,461620,30027954,Posted: 18 February,all,Ebino,"This is a very good turn-based strategy game. One game lasts around 200 turns, divided into 3 periods: the building of the first city, the conquest of the Nile, and a period of great prosperity. During each period, there is a number of trials to complete, and then a series of random events. The main line of the game and the trials follow the historical development of Ancient Egypt, from the times of nomadic hunter-gatherers up to the unification of all lands along the Nile and the first great kings. The developers found a balance between historical accuracy and enjoyment; there is a wealth of information to learn about these ancient times, presented as short paragraphs after events or discoveries. I learnt quite a few things!The game uses 2 maps, one for the first city, and one for the region around the Nile. These maps must be explored to unlock land and resources, discover and interact with different tribes. There are 4 types of resources, used to grow the population, build city improvements, discover knowledge, receive favors from gods or help with the completion of trials. Interaction with tribes include raids and conquests, trade, and the sending of gifts to curry favor. Better relations lead to bonuses to trade, or the ability to peacefully merge with the tribe. Random events happen at fixed turns during the game, simulating either actions from tribes, natural phenomena, or internal affairs.To achieve a good score at the end of the game, it is necessary to plan carefully what and when to research or build, how much to grow or explore. This includes some micro-management like where to place units to produce the desired level of each resource. How much of a given resource is available at a given spot varies during the development of the game,  either as a consequence of random events, or as a historical consequence (like the change of climate over the period covered by the game). Discoveries and buildings also impact available resources.Each period plays as a tactical race to achieve a number of goals, marked by the trials; the player is kept under pressure, as achieving ""gold level"" on every trial is not easy. Not only planning is crucial, but the careful execution of a strategy is necessary. Each turn, each action, each unit counts. Sadly, the pressure can be so high that a single unfavorable random event may sometimes cause the expected mid-to-long term goal to be irreparably missed, even when understanding the fine points of the game mechanics. Getting one of the best scores involves some level of luck (aka save scumming), which is a drawback in a strategy game.The graphics are charming, beautiful, and their style serves the gameplay and historical background well. The music is relaxing and unobtrusive, and the sound effects well done. The UI is intuitive, entirely made of clicks, drags and drops.I highly recommend this game to any who enjoy a strategic challenge and are looking for a different (refreshing) setting."

It has elements of a citybuilder and grand strategy, but is a bit more ""linear"" than your typical strategy game. This means that cities grow more organically and you get to focus on a scale of decisionmaking that makes sense for the scale of your empire. Early on, you are deciding which forest you want to forage in. End game, you are choosing what form of tribute you want from neighboring colonies so you can defeat your rival kingdom. This transition would be hard to pull off in a sandbox game.I think this game is easily worth the full price.

There is VERY little in terms of choice in this game in general. Which really doesn't help with the utter lack of replayability.Good concept, I enjoyed the artistic style quite a bit, the historical accuracy, the music and so forth but it's far too short, too restrictive, not enough choices, limits you to 200 turns (which go by fast) and holds the players hand far too much.As it is now, I'd give it like a 5/10. If they add more options and make it longer then I'd say it'd be worth the cash for sure. If you're buying it for a sibling or say one of your kids around the age of 8-12 then I'd give it a 7/10 due to the learning aspect of it."

Very simple to understand tough, I also recommend new players to use the tutorial and pay attention to the missions that are presented. Because those help a lot in finding your footingThe graphics are very simplistic, but fit really well with the theme of Ancient Egypt.The replay value at first may not be the best because the game uses the same map every time with only slight variations on the spawn locations and yields. But seeing your score at the end of the game, you can definatly get hooked on the idea that: 'you can do better'The different difficulty settings (which are also bound to your end score) also add more variety by making the game easier or harder in different aspects.If you have the cash on hand, and want a game that requires a decent amount of strategy and planning ability, you might be interested."

For example a tribe may be called the Bull tribe in one game, but the Flax Flower tribe in another, but it will be in the same place, trade the same things, and have the same military strength. So essentially if you replay it, you'll see the exact same game again with different icons on the map. After you've finished it once, well, the only reason to replay is to see if you can do it on a higher difficulty.I mean, lliterally. You may or may not be able to see that I've played it for 5.8 hours, but that was playing it twice, plus a couple of false starts. I had to play it again to see if anything was different.

Just exploring the 2000 years of ancient Egyptian history is enchanting, especially with the aboslutely stunning artwork the game has.

The graphic suit the game well. What real fun of game trying is managment your people well enought that you can keep up with world throw at you see them grown from small grow of hunter and gathers to the first nation State in the west! Give you idea how awesome it was egypt came into being at all. I would dare say as well it one better educational game as it will teach you history. So if your history lover and like trial give this one a shot!One thing I love about this game is it scope! This game being at year 5000 BC in Prehistoric Egypt. You start as a small tribe of hunter and gather in mild of mirgration. Now each turn is span of 20 years. You as you play see then settle into area deveplment way suriving and meeting culture more advance then them. One great thing about this game with name drop culture wha limit intereactive your tribe had with so in turn you can look it up if curious. If want to get the most point by the end of the game you have to advance your tribe as was it historic missions and do well trials that get throw at you. You see them deveplement into the badari culture. Which is intresting because you tell you something special about this prehistoric nile culture but if you are like you them up later. Once you reach that point in the game your people are settle farmer the women are reverned you tribe of hunter and grather inevolved into fully settle people and looking as falcon as good luck as turn into own reglion. By end of end of the game your playing as almost mythical ancient King Narmer bring the under and lower Kingdom together building Memphis the last of prehistoric/predynastic kings and the first dynastic king.

Normally I hate easy difficulties and like a good challenge, but in this case it felt way too hard on the easy difficulty and for the wrong reasons, and there isn't a clear way to know you'r not doiing well until the end of that game so it can be frustrating at that point.Anyway, I realize I was a bit too harsh on tha game before, I probably expected too much of a 9$ game. And above all, the developers response have been awesome, and I value this almost as much as a good game. I wish them well, it's a good first try (if it is) and maybe we'll get better games from them in the future.A note to the developer tho: yes I am from Egypt and I love storytelling in games, but it needs to be a bit less subtle to grab my attention, needs to play a bigger part somehow..it didn't really connect with me in the game.I'm changing this to a positive review, for 9 bucks and a few hours, I did have some good fun even if it didn't last forever, but I guess that's fair :)"

It's not like the Sids games, it's more of a city- worker/resource manager with a grand strategy. You have milestones that you must hit along the way but you're faced with challenges and random events that can either help or hurt you. UI is great and easy to learn, and has enough depth to keep you interested. A play through takes about 1-2 hours, so you can get a good game in a short amount of time. Each playthrough you must choose 1 of 3 starting conditions out of 4 different categories, so you can have a couple of different play throughs each time with varying difficulties.Unlike what others have said, the game is not broken or unbalanced. I was able to beat it the first time through on easy with out a problem, but I've played other Pre-civ games so I knew somewhat what to expect. If it's like the other games, then the devs will do a great job of balancing any issues found and fixing bugs as they come up.If you like this genre then I recommend the game, and it's a must buy if on sale."

So I played 6 hours. I tried the easiest setting supposedly. The fastest game was FIVE turns where mysteriously my two guys just disappeared?! The first guy or the second guy ALWAYS seems to disappear on turn 4 for some reason? EVERY time.  Your guy disappears on turn 4.  (WTF?)The game crushes you on 'easy' setting, I have no idea what it does on harder settings ( that makes it not fun for me, makes me give the game a bad review, tell my friends not to buy it, and post negative in the forums).I found it to be unrealistic to 'win' the different levels / challenges. I tried expanding fast, didn't work. I tried expanding slow to build up resources, didn't work as the game just cascades down on you that you are behind to build a temple or whatever because you have been trying to gather resources – or else the game just attacks you with superior numbers.I have like 400 guys and get crushed by an army of over 1000 because I haven't even discovered the other tribes I need.  When I do find the tribes to bolster my army, I don't have enough little hammer production to give them gifts and 'Unite' in time.   One time I actually DID have more soldiers than the attacking army (barely), but they won because they 'flanked' me?  Where do I learn flanking, or anti-flanking, or anything I need?  Nowhere, game over, city defeated.The game tells you that I have so many turns to build something and I haven't even explored the North of the city I need to progress the discoveries I need.  There's an automatic blockade, and so I have to stop everything to research and research to get the workaround.BOTH times I got to the '15 turns to end of game' warning I was NOWHERE near uncovering the fog of war map, let alone converting the tribes I need!  So in 15 turns I have to uncover the rest of the map, and fight or convert like 7 cities?  Really?  I think the BEST I got was ONE city on the big map converted before getting the 15 turn warning.The biggest army I amassed by end game was 1.1K, meanwhile Seth had one city with 7K, a couple with 3K, and more... really?  This is EASY?  This is FUN?Honestly, did you have ANYone test this thing out that is a casual gamer that doesn't know the code?  ... or was I it?  Did I have to buy the f ing game to test it for you and give you game play feedback?

The part that actually made me turn the thumb up is that it offers enough to hold attention and appeal to curiosity without crushing peoples interest with text-blocks.The gameplay itself is decent, nothing extraordinary but at least without any bugs that I've encountered to date which is an achivement in it's own right.I earlier said that the game was pricey for what it offered, but I am just a bitter git after all the indie-developers that has ripped people off and the many, many games that have just been disappointments.Egypt Pre-Civilization makes no disillusions of what it is - A game to show you a window in time."
