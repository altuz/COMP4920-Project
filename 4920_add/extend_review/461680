,Recommended,461680,22719383,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,Laetye,"Pros:+Looks very nice on max graphics, best looking drone sim so far.+Easy to set up with Taranis X9D Tx.+Controls are tight and responsive, and easily customisable.+Fair price point, comes in at half the price of Liftoff ($19.99) and double FPV Freerider ($5).Cons(I understand most of these are because of early access):-Only has a single level at the moment, would love to see more in the future.-No drone customisation (parts, design etc.) besides LED colour. Would also like to see some customisation similar to Liftoff.-I cannot run the game in fullscreen mode, I can only play windowed mode (I have multiple monitors, I think it's messing with the game a little).Suggestions:-I would love to see a free flight mode with an optional god mode to muck around in and not worry about crashing and resetting.-Player made content would be awesome, especially through steam workshop. Players could submit drone part assets, levels, you name it for anyone to use.-A campaign mode, no drone simsas far as I knowinclude a campaign mode. I think the devs could take advantage of this and really set this game apart from the other sims.I can't review multiplayer aspects yet as I have not tried them, feel free to add me if you want to try some multiplayer in the future and I can revisit this review.Overall, it is a great simulator, definitely pick it up and practice with it - it might save you a few real life crashes and save you more than the game cost itself.Looking forward to updates from the developers!"

Really love crash animations like IRL.Setup can't be easier with Taranis, tuning is limited but don't like to bother on this usually so it's pretty ok for me.Physics is convicing but still need to be improved. Throttle isn't powerful enough (likely 3S or less).Most of my crashes come from that point.One map only, fun to play with but a bit small, you get LOS quite quickly.Respawn function works great, You restart instantly. No god mode but very friendly at low speed.Would love for next update :- one or two more maps- 4S Lipo flystyle- Recording function (and share a flight on FB for instance)- several frames and spare partsWell done on this one !Time to go back in the game and cut some trees  ;)"

,Not Recommended,461680,26094208,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Jimmy,"This game used to be alright, before the new update. It felt extremely unrealistic at first, but after playing with the ingame settings for a while I managed to get something that felt alrightish. Now with the new update a lot of those settings are gone, and replaced with ""rates"". It feels like to me that this was a step back rather than forward. This being fixed along with some menu updates, it still could have potential. As of now, I would rather find something else.Unless there is something I've missed, it is now way harder to control throttle especially indoors. (had to enable throttle expo to 2 for it to not shoot into the ceiling on 5% throttle.)It sort of feels like a step in the right direction at some places. And two steps back in others. I miss the settings for weight, and the rates settings, doesn't seem to go high enough, and the roll, pitch and yaw can feel a bit too cinematic at the moment."

,Recommended,461680,23092414,"Posted: 19 May, 2016",all,Phasedragon,"Fantastic game/simulator. I've never touched a real drone or fpv goggles in my life and I feel much more confident that I at least wouldn't make a fool out of myself if I ever try someone's. And I certainly intend to, because this has really inspired me to give it a shot!I'll leave others to say how realistic it is, as that is a concern of mine, but I must say that it is very well done and looks gorgeous. The developer(s) watch feedback and implement suggestions within days; hopefully this, along with additional content, can keep this game running and make it as popular as it deserves to be."
,Not Recommended,461680,25571180,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,AndyKayJah,yeah... should've listened to the warnings^^well at least it looks cooler than the other FPV Racing games^^EDIT:OK that's unfair... this game has some potential and after fiddling with the drag and weight slider a little bit I got it to behave sorta believable... still doesn't come close to the real thing or the realism wee see in liftoff or hotprops for instance.For real FPV Pilots this still can be fun... it's hard and unforgiving and the gates are placed by an evil person^^ If you're looking for a challenge this game is for you^^But if you don't have an FPV Racing or FPV Freestyle background and have no exeprience with flying a quadcopter back off...I also can't imagine to play this with a regular Gamepad.I'd love to see more development as 10 bucks are a hefty price for what feels like a hobby project that is far from completion!
76561197991354216,Recommended,461680,33498467,Posted: 13 July,all,Aecos,"This is a fantastic game. It runs and loads fast, the graphics are nicer than a lot of other FPV games/sims and it runs perfectly with my Spektrum DX8 (i use the Aerofly usb connector from Hobby King $5) I like the realisitc look of the area and the quad. I see a lot of negative reviews for this game and i have never had any of the prolems mentioned. If you have never flown a multirotor before the controls might take a bit of getting used to but they seem realistic. The game probably isnt as forgiving as Liftoff but i think thats a good thing."

The installer would hang during the UE4 prerequisites installation.After a couple of hours I worked out that BEFORE you try to install this game, You should download and install the following:Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 (NDP461-KB3102438-Web)Visual C++ 2015 redistributable x64 (vc_redist.x64)UE4 Prerequisites x64 (ue4prereqsetup_x64)Make sure to restart windows after each installer.Now the FPV Air Tracks installer should complete sucessfully.I've played this game for about 20 mins and I wasn't so impressed... the Video makes it look much more interesting than it really is. Hopefully it'll grow on me once I manage to get the controls set up properly, which at the moment are terrible. Many other bugs.....Refund pending."
76561198018557603,Recommended,461680,22906167,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,Sli,"Does exactly what it says on the tin. Physics are fairly crisp and the courses are challenging. Lacking content, graphical fidelity and UI polish right now but this game will appease many drone enthusiasts.It's got a very high skill curve and I found the stock throttle control was fairly difficult on a PS4 DS controller since it lacks the ability to hold the throttle at a specific value unlike a typical tx. (Have yet to try it with my Dx5e since I need a specific cable). I wouldn't recommend this game at all for someone wanting to just use a KB/Mouse.Overall I think for the $12 price this is a no brainer for anyone looking or interested in trying drone flying without the larger investment or worrying about crashing. Right now content is extremely limited, which does question is longevity, but I think if the devs are consistent with updates this game could be a fantastic sandbox for drone enthusiasts in the future.Things i'd like to see:UI improvements; it's blocky and messy in places (yes it's EA, but it needs more consistency)Drone customization, props, motors, batteries, flight controllers etc in addition to the weight/power sliders in settingsLess dependence on 'set' courses/maps and a 'random' or 'seeded' option that mixes up the gate locations each time. All levels quickly become stale after you race them a few times.Workshop integration; drone skins, custom maps/level generator"

No option to turn off fpv noise. Needs a lot of work. Very flashy and good graphics but lacks the basics needed to even make it a viable beta. Liftoff had a much better beta launch.
