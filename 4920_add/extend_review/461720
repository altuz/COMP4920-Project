They havent updated it for months and it only released a few months ago! Dont buy, wait for devs to add content. I'll be refunding my purchase."

Now it is only a cash grab machine with no real value, by the time many people realize that it will never leave from early access, players will go over their 2 hour limit for refund. I got it with 90% coupon and I actually feel robbed so I asked for a refund."

,Recommended,461720,25173908,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,Engibeer,"Its fun, but its one sided. The enemy tanks can see you from a mile away, while you can only see whats on the screen. The enemys also have perfect aim. If your going to make a fun game, it can be difficult, but it caant be obsurd and unfair. Developers, please take not of this. Make the game more fair please! This game has so much potential, and you dont wanna screw it up. Make it so the enemys can only see you if they are on the screen, make their aim less perfect."
,Not Recommended,461720,28255663,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,schwem00,"Pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ so far.Enemy tanks can see you from across the map, and shoot from that far, but you can only see a very small portion of the map at a time. You die in one shot and the tank doesn't handle very well, so you stop very slowly and make wide turns, making it impossible to 'dodge' shots. Enemies also have instant reaction times, which is probably the biggest problem this game has right now. As soon as you enter their LOS at all, they immediately turn and shoot with 100% accuracy, they only miss if you are half the map away or extremely lucky."

,Not Recommended,461720,32520684,Posted: 17 June,all,engie,"I know it looks promising but it simply isn't fun enought.This game needs more time in developement.Some pros/cons:+ Soundtrack is good.+ looks good.- SERIOUS balance issues. You spawn in the center of the small map surrounded by 4-5 tanks. And one of them takes 2 shots to kill. You die from 1. Good luck.- (Related to above:) If you are going to make a different AI tanks then MAKE them different: if you build a huge tank that takes 2 shots to kill but IT kills YOU just as fast and sniper-like like the all other small tanks - then you just made a reskin with fatter health bar. Implement variation and strategies. FORCE players to think. And give them a chance to win. It should be tank blast not tank r a p e.- Which side of my tank is front/rear/left, right side? Your tank is just a fricking square, and after rotating the gun I have no idea where I'm facing to and I'm driving like alcoholic again. Try to do that while being surrounded by tanks starting shooting at you. Good luck.- And now add arcad-ish contols to the above issue. (This issue was on Xbox contoller, I dont rememeber how was the keyboard contol scheme) When you press left the tank drives ""in curve"" to the left. Yes it ""simple"" way to control your tank... but no. Its not. Very often you will end up ramming the wall. The contol of your tank needs to be precise.- Needs more content. And I'm not talking about ""more levels"".refunded.Edit: if my review becomes outdated at some points then go ahead and drop a comment with something that was already fixed / improved."
,Recommended,461720,32208729,Posted: 5 June,all,TricksyKitsune,"The game is good. Movement and shooting is pretty simple, but it works well. The shooting part is actually pretty gratifying, and the levels are difficult. I will say they are too difficult though... The AI is ALWAYS dead on, there is no missing unless the player changes their movement after they have fired. If you miss a single shot you will likely die. That is the annoying part, their is no bullet deviation randomness that can cause close calls, It is always a dead on aim. This might be fun for some and usually is for me, but it is too much on some of the scenario's... first couple levels and it is already crazy...The other part that is a bit of  issue is the interface, and lack of proper settings... Other than that it is pretty fun. Don't think it will be finished, but for a 90% sale it is fine."
,Recommended,461720,30822665,Posted: 29 March,all,HuggyDeathBunny🐰💀,"Stonkingly good soundtrack, energetic frenzied gameplay, brilliant execution of a simple old classic redone in glorious mad explosiveness.A true arcade game with immense replayability and sufficiently engaged to wrap you up in it for sections of time that will have you not minding repeating the same level over after just barely dying at the last enemy as its such satisfying fun making those little tanks go BOOM into a bazillion pixels.At the price you cant go wrong, although content wise I'd say its more that fairly priced even though you have high replayability. Its small, its entertaining and its jolly good fun."

It has great controls, a nice looking art style and great music. However, this game will molest you with its difficulty, its a serious challenge but thats what makes it so satisfying when you beat a level! Underrated game and fully worth the price (Add more levels and a difficulty setting please, some kids may not be able to actully beat this game)"

,Not Recommended,461720,29127344,Posted: 8 January,all,Hat Dog,"Oh how I hate this game. Lets think of some reasons. Inexplicably hard, AI is aimbot, most flash games have more content, the tanks can see you when you cant see them, insults you for trying to make the slightly more tolerable, the menu screen is garbage, white text over white background, the wall physics make you stop when you drive slanted into them, been in beta for a few years, crappy royalty-free techno and finally a $5 pricetag really? Come on guys. This concludes my review of a flash game-esque tank ""game."""

76561198165888588,Not Recommended,461720,34586005,Posted: 29 August,all,irelandvonvicious,My first negative review.This game is fun.It's like the old atari tank games.The issues:It has bad achievements.As in you have to do really poorly and really good at the game to get them all.It has a hard reboot option because you will need it. If you play this long term it can not be avoided.Some issues with collision but they are minor.It has no multi player.The arena does not work either.Devs have abandoned.The web site for the game has been taken down.It's a 4/10 but worth it for $0.49.It will be fun for a one time play through in single player if you like a challenge.Steam will probly just end up removing this game due to it never leaving early access.
