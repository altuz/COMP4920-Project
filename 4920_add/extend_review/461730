It's actually painful to play especially once you get into the later levels. I only bought it because it was $1, and I love Super Meat Boy, so naturally I thought it would be at least a little playable.I thought wrong."

It's a simple game with simple mechanics, so don't expect doing some puzzle problem solving to progress through the levels. Generallu it's fun and the music is modern and nice."

,Recommended,461730,30423334,Posted: 10 March,all,Steve from Customer Service,"Very fun platformer. Has a supermeatboy-esque feel while keeping it super simple. It will definitely give you some frustration though, some of the levels are absoultely BRUTAL. For .50-1.00$, definitely pick this up."

Two ER visits later and I'm only on lv 19.As difficult as this game is, when you finally beat that level that has been spitting in your face for the last 10 mintues, oh man that feeling is oh so good."

,Not Recommended,461730,29107633,Posted: 7 January,all,DandereSuki,"I'm not sure how you climb the ladder, but it's definitely not a good game, you would rather buy ten ""super meatboy"" than buying this crap."
76561198274214552,Not Recommended,461730,33411879,Posted: 9 July,all,Starble,It's just annoying. The things that make it difficult are bad controls and enemies with random movements that result in luck being one of the main factors for any success.

Then damn you gotta hate this game. Overall solid 8/10,good music,good gameplay,controller works perfect, I just wish respawning took less..."
76561198053392314,Not Recommended,461730,31695640,Posted: 11 May,all,Mai Li,"The level design is pretty interesting but the controls are a bit weird feeling, which is exactly what you don't want if you need players to move with precision. Ladders are honestly pretty messed up. Going up at the top of the ladder shouldn't throw you off, and getting onto the ladder in the first place is way more difficult than in needs to be. (You should be able to access ladders from any spot touching them, not from only a single standing position at the bottom.)"
76561197983660113,Recommended,461730,31649398,Posted: 9 May,all,Walter,"A nice little platformer game. It moves fast. You'll die a lot. Looks a bit like LIMBO but pixelized.There is no story. Get from point A to point B. Some achievements, that are easy to unlock.Playing time depends on how good you are. Game runs smoothly and fast.I played through it in 64 min. That is with a lot of dying over and over. Some points in the game are a little frustrating, such as climbing ladders and timing. But you'll figure it out. That's the challenge of the game.It's a plus that the player respawns really quickly so that it becomes an addiction to retry a level over and over.I payed 0,49 cents for the game. Get it when it's cheap. It's a short game for now. I think they're still working this game to improve it. Grab it if you wanna play a short challenging game!"

I died so many times, and then stuck at level 13 now. The achievements is pretty funny though, 1000/10 I'd recommend this one. It's so addictive, if only I wasn't playing that at 4am xD."

I was surprised to discover that I was wrong, this is a great game and well worth even 5 bucks.  The depth of the gameplay was really engrossing, and the level count is satisfying!  A little buggy, though, with rndom fps drops on an i7 6700k and GTX 1080 TI.7/10"
