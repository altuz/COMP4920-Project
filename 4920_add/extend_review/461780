It's incredibly disconnected. Your guests are your quest givers who occasionally vomit on floors. That's it. Adventuring costs you money in health potions. The difficulty grade of quests only changes the amount of maps you have to run through till you reach your goal. Notice ""run through"" as you cannot realistically fight and expect to survive. Each time you die it takes 10 points from your max health, ensuring your next death comes that much quicker. You can forage for ingredients sure. But the items you pick up are worthless for vendors, eliminating that route for early game cash. Leveling only allows you to use the next tier gear and is pretty much a joke. The most cost effective way to earn money is to sit on your hands and do nothing while the clock ticks over into another day. I wanted to like this game. I like simulation games. This feels like a rushed, unbalanced, grab at fans of Stardew Valley. Save your money and wait. Hopefully, with some work, this will be a good game. But right now it's not worth it"

I feel like there would be many, many hours of gameplay here. Unfortunately, the entire game just feels clunky. the frame rate is terrible, the mechanics are a bit wonky, time FLIES by and doesn't pause during open dialogue with other npcs. In time and with some work, this could be incredible. But as it is now....not so much. I will remain hopeful, though. So for now, I would not recommend this...let's hope that changes!"

Still, even with a few problems and frustrations, I've played the game for four hours, so it isn't all bad!I've found the game feels very unpolished and clumsy, and if I had known the game was in this state, I would not have purchased it.  However, I love the premise of the game, and I'm going to hold onto this game rather than request a refund, in hopes the developer will polish it up a bit and make it run smoother.The framerate is terrible, and moving around it feels like the screen is constantly making tiny jumps, instead of smoothly flowing with the motion of your character. The tutorial is barely adequate, with a talking cat helping you find your way along a little.  Combat was confusing to me, and my familiar ""passed out"" as well as myself passing out (-10 max health after awakening in the tavern) and I have no idea how to see how much life my familiar has.UPDATE on screen jumpiness: Turning off effects helped a bit, but I'm still having troubles, and my computer, although two years old, isn't poor by any means... Still, I watched a couple videos on YouTube of this game, and noticed others are able to run the game fine without the screen jumpiness I experience while moving.In town, the menus are clumsy, and I learned the hard way I can't simply switch from purchasing to selling items, without first exiting the purchase screen (by hitting esc) then hitting sell to get the sell menu.  I ended up buying something I didn't need by accident trying to switch screens instead.I think this game might be fun after spending some more time getting used to how poor the UI is, and maybe taking some anti-seizure medication for the screen jumpiness.  here is hoping the game improves with time and patches."

It should have been developed more before being released.Pros:Nice art style, kinda like an old RPG.Lots of freedom in what you do - sorta.You can explore a lot.Cons:No instructions whatsoever, They tell you how to move around, but not where anything is, or how to do anything other than find the bartender. For God's sakes people, just put some signs up!Quests are all the same. You literally find all the same quests in difficulties you can't choose.It takes forever to get any money, especially in quests. This is compounded by the fact that you have to pay A LOT of taxes. I'd either remove the tax system, or make getting money much easier.The 'romance' is flat, one-sided, and doesn't take any 'story' progression at all. Seriously, this game needs a lot more work before I'd buy it, even for eight dollars. Also, the movement is shoddy.Overall, needs work. It's a neat idea for a game, but they went a bit overboard in terms of NOT THINKING about what they were doing. I returned the game for steam cash within two hours.Sorry if this seemed like a bash on the developers. This could be a fantastic little game, but it's not nearly there yet.Consider that before you buy the game."

The problem isn't that the game is bad, but the developers. Had they continued to push out content and updates, this game could have been great. I could have dumped hours and hours into it. However, less than a week from the official release, the developers went radio silent. They even promised a new update way back on May 18th, slated for May 25th. It is now August 23rd at the time I write this review, and there has not been a word, or an update since that post.Now, I normally don't write reviews about this kind of thing.♥♥♥♥♥♥happens, people have lives. A small group of indie devs can have things come up. But it's been three full months. The dev's haven't posted or replied to anything on the forums in that time. They also gave absolutely no indication they were going on hiatus. They just took the money and ran.Apparently this developer group has a history of abbandoning games. Their last couple hotel simulator games were abbandoned and left incomplete. This is just one more on the list.Is it a bad game? No. Is it worth the money? Honestly, the $8.00 asking price is quite reasonable for what you get.Should you buy it?I wouldn't, the game needs work, and it doesn't look like its ever going to get it. If the game had any future prospect I would probably recommend it, but right now, while it isn't a bad game, you can do better with your $8.00.Developers shouldn't be encouraged to do this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I will say that at least this group moved out of early access before abbandoning the project. But they still abbandoned it within a week of its release, so that isn't much better."

(this is 99% of the game)This makes some bad third party NES titles look like they have good combat programing. This is like Cheetahmen bad. If you do play, do not pick the fighter class, you will just die. Do not pick the guns, you will run out of ammo and will not have enough ore to make more, then die. See latter but with mage. Pick the Ranger class with both guns and wands and you may have a chance to not die, but no gaurentees.The platform/programming.This is a rush title with an amazing premise. It is sad that the developers chose to rush out the product instead of taking the time to produce a quality piece of software that would be solidly enjoyable. I played for a little under an hour and was completely underwhelmed. I wanted the negetive reviews to be trolls, but they aren't. This game is plagued with legitimate problems and should be labeled an early access title in its current state of completion. It is in a very rough beta at best.All the love to the developers, as I hope they can polish a diamond out of what is a particularly soft piece of coal at the moment. I am going to get a refund for now though."

The actual questing and gameplay are very repetitive. Pathfinding and hit boxes feel clunky.It's been fun for a few hours but without a deeper story or stronger motivation, I'm not feeling a lot of incentive to keep grinding."
,Not Recommended,461780,23096520,"Posted: 20 May, 2016",all,Iridium,"I like the overall concept of the game but the execution here is terrible. The controls are... nonsensical is probably the best word to use. For instance, the escape button works to exit some menus but not others, and their claims of ""mouse 1 to attack"" seem to be incorrect. And also weird, because you wouldn't otherwise have your hand on the mouse at all. Further, gamepad support would be very helpful here, but of course it isn't present.And of course, no way to remap keys. Or at least not that I can find: the menus are another example of execution issues here. You can hit a button to bring up audio and graphics options, which launches a Windows options box with check marks and all, but doing so doesn't release the mouse cursor to you to actually have an affect on it, and therefore I haven't been able to click through the menus.I'd love to be able to say ""but the story/art/music is so charming that once you get used to the controls it's great"", but those aren't stellar either. The music is ok but not stellar, the art kind of irks me for reasons I can't quite put into words, and while the story (so far) is ok, the dialogue for it is weak. You don't feel transported to a magical land, you feel like you're still struggling to figure it all out.If this was an early access game, or it had had a lengthier QA / testing cycle (as in, getting someone who was willing to provide direct and honest criticism to play it), then it might be in a better state and poised to sharpen itself up with some patching. It doesn't at all feel like that's the case here."

As someone who has played Apocalypse Hotel, I can say that this game has a vastly improved interface and seems to be a much bigger world, which I'm excited to explore.----OUTDATED----The problem is that the game is rather unoptimized and the low framerate has prevented me from doing much of that exploring. I'm giving this a thumbs down for now, but if the framerate issue gets fixed I'll edit this review as necessary.Note: While I consider this to be unlikely, I won't ignore the possibility that it is my computer causing the issue, rather than the game. If you are reading this and are experiencing similar issues, let me know in the comments.----OUTDATED----NEW VERDICT: A fix has been added to the game. Pressing the 9 key will disable lighting effects, which (for me at least) has solved the framerate issue. With that issue out of the way, the game can be played smoothly. The game itself is essentially a revamped and improved version of Apocalypse Hotel in a fantasy setting, so if you were a fan of that, you will enjoy this."

,Not Recommended,461780,24163376,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,Hyena,"So basically I gave the game a second chance and it COULD be awesome. Could.And SPOILER alarm!Lets start with the beginning:- The game is extremely laggy. you are forced to play it ""offline"" with closed steam, no effects and win XP mode to be able to enjoy it at least a bit. it's still laggy, but that's the only way  -> thats why i have ""just"" 20 minutes ingame. Actually I have waaaaaay more.- LOTS OF BUGS. My husband decided to change his gender after the birth of our child. Out of a sudden. The shadow farmiliar becomes a tree in his second evolution and changes back with the third (or maybe it was 3 and 4, I cant remember)- Gnome will stop eating and start again after a few IG days.- The pet-heal fountain, that SHOULD be there, doesnt exist on my savefile. Other people see it when they start a new game, then it disapperas before they could build it. other people had it from the beginning.!! But what's even worse than all of this: it seems like the developers have ABANDONED this game. There were no updates for a LONG time and even the promised update for the end of may never came. And this is the reason why I feel SO betrayed. Without the bugs it could be a nice little game to kill some time (even though I was done after 12hrs with EVERYTHING) !!"

Yes it's unpolished, but the devs are trying to take care of that.  Others are hating on how difficult/simpistic it is.  Either hire a human basic cook at the beginning and sit on your hands wasting time away or lose in frustration to the Royal Tax Collector (who seems to be the biggest actual enemy in the game).  But there's a pattern to everything.  As of this review, all you have to do is remember six dates:  the 5th, 15th, and 25th then the 6th 16th and the 26th.  The first three are when the arena happens and at 1900 the organizer needs rooms for his guys.  At the start an easy 300 gold.  The second set of dates is when the true archvillain of the game shows up, the tax collector.  Seriously?  What tax collector shows up that many times in a single month?  He's pocketin most of your harrd earned cash, no doubt.  But, if you stockpile meals with the cook, open rooms slowly, you can easily deal with these obviously over TRITE obstacles.  Just kill/gather enough to make up the differece and soon you'll be able to wander/kill/gather/kill to your herat's delight.  And as a bonus, please take this into consideration:  At 0600 (the start of the new day with the management screen popping up)  everything resets.  So, if you're in, let's say, a DRAGON HORDE MISSION, and you've cleared everything out  and it's close to 0600, just wait there until afterwards and watch every chest close and refill with goodies.  And don't forget about the Shadow Famliar.  It can be a major boon if you take the time.  The game is not perfect, but it is a very good time management sim that deserves some credit."

I can say that while there are problems with the game; the tutorial is fairly useless, the combat mechanics make no sense, the lack of diversity in the battle system entirely, and the bare bones mechanics of understanding your character's status (and the fact you can't even check other party members aside from level) I can't for the life of me understand some of the other gripes people are making about this game.It's a fun little game with a unique system. I love the option of making your own Tavern. All I really want is more more more though. I want to be able to modify my character a bit. I want a bit more of variety in gear or at least some more methods of improving my character's abilities. The way to accumulate money only ""seems"" hard at first but, once you understand a good portion of the mechanics you realize that gathering cash should never be an obsticle ever. It's just not done in the standard way of ""kill enemies and watch them drop money"". Which to be honest is actually a nice touch in my opinion.All in all this game could have much much more added to it. but, the unique premise just makes me want to greedily play it more and more and hope for vast additions to the game or just more additions to this type of genre.  8/10"

Its pretty good, especially for the price, but low end computers might struggle a bit.Hey there, if you're being discouraged by the bad reviews note that almost all of them are due to performance issues.It doesn't seem to be optimized the best since I'm also getting fairly poor framerate, but I'm fairly certain that has more to do with my system than the game itself. He did update for a ""no effects"" option and that has helped slightly.The game has been very charming and entertaining so far. The visitors to your tavern all have different quirks and stories to tell, and the variety of crafting/pets its nice.For its price I think this game is well worth it, especially if you have a system that can handle it well. Hopefully it will be optimized a little better here in the soon future for people like myself.I'm not sure how limited RPG maker is, but I do have a couple suggestions for the developer, other than making the game run smoother.1: Maybe make it so loot from baddies is auto picked up when walking over/near it.  Sometimes when an enemy dies their loot gets sent flying behind some trees and it can be quite difficult to find.2: More random events within the tavern.  These travelers and heroes have character and it would be fun to see them interact more, maybe get into bar fights, have a druid accidentally set something on fire, that sort of deal.  I'm not sure if these are already implemented as I'm still pretty early into the game.3. Customization. Lots of people enjoy personalizing and making something their own.  If possible maybe implement some sort of decorating system. (different flooring, wallpapers, rugs, tables, mats, etc. That can be placed where they want, so you can make it different.)  It will make you feel more so like you've actually built it up from the ground.Just a few suggestions, but otherwise its a real solid game so far, just needs some polish.  Keep up the hard work and keep updating the game and it could go far."

Like all RPG games there is definately a level of grinding so you can earn money to fix up your tavern. The quests are a bit redundant taking you through a series of randomly generated screens. Over all I like the game I have spent 15 hours playing it as of the writing of this review. The author says they will continue to add more content but even if they never added more content it is still woth the small $7.99 price tag."

I haven't even made it to the gnome home world that everyone in my tavern are talking about which is as I've figured the first place you actually unlock and everything in my tavern is already at its maximum level (from my knowledge)Edit: This game has also be scrapped by the devs, there was an update schedueled for the 18th of May that has not been dropped and noone has heard from the devs about this game since then, do not waste your money on this game like I did"

I've tried manipulating the graphics settings to no avail. There's no interaction with customers or selling of items to them. This is nothing that I thought it would be.

Trolls will be ignored. And Flamers will just make a fool of themselves as I watch them flame for some unknown reason.Reviewer: CodexGame: Moonstone TavernDate: 5/20/2016Time Posted: 11:01 PMFirst off! The negatives!This game is fun and it really is..However I do not recommend it until they add more content. There is alot of repeat quests and such. And you can only marry one person (I chose the Unlikely Hero.) and to top that off the relationship between you and her in the game is totally rushed and find that they didn't work at all on the marriage system of the game.Now I wouldn't be upset about it if you NEEDED to be married in order to continue with the story after a certain point. That's right! You heard me. You have to be married after a certain point in the storyline. And to top that off, the only person you can marry is a girl who you talk to in the town. Once you talk to her she flirts with you a little and you flirt back. Suddenly she says for you to prove that you love her and get married.Which I think is VERY flawed in a Marriage system.There are also not alot but a few spelling errors such as when it is time for breakfast in the tavern, the tavern folk say ""*Race name* break their fast""It should be ""*Race name* eat their breakfast""There is also not much content as I said from up top as there is alot of repeated quests which can probably be boring for alot. Unless you are a person like me who enjoys playing it regardless.And onto the Postives!The story is very interesting! I will not go into detail as it is spoilers I can if some request it and I will edit it later but for now nope.You can get a familiar! Which is basically a pet/compainion! All of them are very different and you can only get them either by breeding other familiars, getting eggs as gifts from the tavern folks, or finding eggs from the quests you get.LOTS of upgrades for the Tavern! I don't just mean alot! I mean ALOT. Even now I am still upgrading my tavern I got all of the rooms upgraded up to 400 silver and now all I need is to upgrade all of them to 1000 silver..Which is going to take me awhile.Arena betting! You can bet on who will win or lose it all at the Arena! The chances get lower as you upgrade the rooms for the combanants! However the lower the chance the bigger the reward. I got 3500 silver from winning the Arena bet while the rooms were maxed out on upgrades.Gain Piety! And gain the help of the goddesses! Everytime you donate to the churches or do a good deed like donate to charity you will get piety which you can use to use magical scrolls that can grant you any effect depending on what scroll you got.This is a great game! It really is! And I see potential! But for now I don't recommend buying it until they add more content and tweak the major stuff like Marriage and etc.___If you liked my review and want to see more reviews in the future please follow me on steam.____Stay safe! And stay cool!Reviewer: CodexEDIT: ""Break their fast"" is not a spelling error or coding error. Someone has informed me that it is based on the olden times and I looked it up some more, and it turns out they are right. So sorry about that everyone."

Lots of things to do and quirks to enjoy and puzzles to solve! There have been some odd bugs here and there, and some parts seem unfinished, but updates have been coming out regularly to fix them so it's all good. Most of the comments saying how disconnected it gets once you're established with the bartender, cooks, etc... but really that's just if all you want to do is scratch the surface of the game. It reminds me a bit of hybrid Recettear and Rune Factory-both of which I love"
,Recommended,461780,24535896,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Fang,"I think this game has alot of potential thats not being realized and would love to see more from it. The story is quite good and did keep me wanting to find out more. The combat is... basic but reminded me of Ys, which is one of my fav games of all time.... Now that the praise is out of the way.... This game needs alot more work then what its getting, calling it rough is being nice honestly. It has Framerate issues and building up the tavern is... not terriable rewarding other than money, which after a point becomes almost 100% useless. Some of the systems seem half finished, suchs as the Marrage system, which from what i can tell was suppose to have more than one choice... but when i looked into the other two they didn't work.PLEASE MAKE THIS GAME AWESOME!!!!!!"

When I started it up there are no graphics options whatsoever, the game tells you to push f1 but these are not graphics options. I play on a large screen at 1440 so apparently for me i have to play this game with it centred in the screen with massive black bars on either side as my computer is just too good. So a warning to anyone who normally plays games at 1440 you will not be able to play this game full screen."

Here pick an Avatar... Pick a class (kinda?)... no details, just a vague here you go make choices. I would have appreciated my choices having some meaning and maybe creating a back story other then walking out of a ?Portal? and talking to a cat? Oh my aunt left me a Tavern? The charms of investment into the why is just as important as the what. I have only played a tiny part, I doubt I'll play more. If I ever desire to spend/waste time going any further in the game I made have more to say, but I'd simply recommend to the people who want a game with a reason to look elsewhere. I'm suprised this game has a mostly positive rating. If I hear about big story update 2.0 I may be interested in this one as the concept seemed kind of fun."

I have a very good GPU card and yet this game lags to hell and back JUST FOR WALKING. Then in the beginning of the game when you're typing in your name if you so happen to have a name with the letter 'C' in it, it thinks it's enter so imagine me, Hi my name is Chelsea, so when I'm typing my name in the moment I type 'C' the game goes on and says 'Nice to meet ya, C' I tried it again with the name Meaya and it worked fine the actually accepted the name. This game makes it incredibly hard to like it and believe me I wanted to.0/10Don't buy, I'm mostly writing this review because their aren't any recent ones which is why my smarty pants self decided to give it a chance."
,Recommended,461780,32490572,Posted: 16 June,all,Capped Tree,"EDIT: As of 8/22/2017So far it seems to be a working product. Yay! Which is great, as this game implemented alot of neat and entertaining ideas and gameplay. I seen it'd been patched and reinstalled it. To my pleasant surprise, it installed. I started up the game and wasn't disappointed. The title screen came up, character selection engaged, the opening mini tutorial played. I got to actually see the Inn itself, wander through the stables and inn, talk to NPCs, cook a meal, go adventuring with a hireling and sleep. This is every bit of fun it'd promised to be. I'm happy for the dev to have fixed their product. It is a brilliant start, if not for the shaking launch, it could have been another Stardew Valley or Harevest Moon/Rogue RPG. With than in mind, I am resending my earlier review.Previous Review on Purchase:Unfortunately, this looked like a great title that wasn't getting a fair chance. As they say ""Buyer beware"" It has a neg rating for a reason. I almost wish there was a -- to give. I was one of the few lucky individuals who the game wouldn't even load properly. It downloaded and installed fine. It booted up fine. I selected my character and started the game...And that was it. It got stuck on this dream sequence like scene that didn't respond to any controls, not even exiting. I had to manually restart my laptop. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it to no avail. Now the game won't even start up, it has script errors. So save yourself the headache and move along."
76561198149763454,Recommended,461780,34430153,Posted: 22 August,all,calvin04,Well this is my first review and it's not good nor bad just plain no flavor at all. The graphics are o.k but then the srceen skips and the gameplay is a gut grinder you make money so slow just so some tax man can come and take your hours of hard work away in secounds. I think if they fix the skipping and the money issue it might be worth a little to those who like to waste time alot of time.
