It started easy and simple by sliding puzzle piece's into their position of the outline. As i progress new mechanics were introduce to slide the pieces in a much more complex yet fun interesting way like turning ,flipping, minimizing, teleporting and unlocking certain line to move pieces. Solving the puzzle was fun and challenging, the music was relaxing. A good game that deserves your attention if you like puzzles or just somebody that needs to kill time."

,Recommended,461840,22855266,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,JacquesLeSauve,"In between sessions of gorging yourself on the latest hundred hour, open-world extravaganza, or main-lining some twitchy, fast paced multiplayer title for weeks at a time, it's nice to take a break every once in a while to enjoy something a little slower or more small scale to cleanse the palette and keep things interesting. Enter Zenge, just what the doctor ordered for such a thing.Zenge is a puzzle game where you slide various shapes along tracks and assemble them to form a picture. Initially they must simply be slid along and put into place in the right order so they can freely move along the tracks without colliding into one another. But as stages progress (70 in total), new features are added, like junctions along the tracks where pieces can be flipped, rotated, teleported or even embiggened or ensmallened to add some spice to the challenge. It's all fiendishly clever and really gets the grey matter firing in a very satisfying way that rarely ever frustrates.The game is incredibly beautiful, too. From the simple yet striking art design, to the gentle, lulling music, everything seems made with the intention of relaxing the player while they try to unravel the conundrums. There is a story told through still images, each one revealed as reward when you assemble the pieces that make each puzzle, but I'll be honest with you, I don't know what the hell it was about. Something about some Ludo pieces finding artefacts related to the game then playing with each other or something, but it pretty much lost me by the end. Though, that said, even if I didn't get it, I still loved the artwork all the same and am happy enough with that.The difficulty of the puzzles felt maybe a little inconsistent on occasion? I had a few moments where progress slowed a little toward the back half, but then I was breezing through the later stages.  But that may simply be human nature and not everyone will find the same parts as easy or hard as others may. I imagine most will finish the game in around 90 minutes or so, and there isn't any real replay value, but at such a low cost I really can't see many complaining by the time they finish. I know I enjoyed every minute of it.So, for hardcore puzzle lovers and casual enthusiasts alike, this gets a resounding thumb being jammed onto a fist, rotated into an upright position, then slid upwards from me. Two of them, in fact."

76561198142934082,Recommended,461840,28517962,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,Karrolanth,"It seems like this game will be quite short, as others have said - I've been playing for around 45 minutes and am probably about halfway through the levels.  However, I bought it on a whim and if I get a couple of hours of enjoyment from a game for only a dollar, I'd consider it money well spent!The music is somewhat repetitive, but I didn't mind that because I found it beautiful and relaxing.  No discordant noises to spoil the mood, just soft and peaceful music which I thought was slightly melancholy at times.The artwork is lovely - quite a simple style, as can be seen in the pictures on the store page, but the colours are wonderful and I found the scenes very pleasing to the eye.I'm not sure about the accompanying story... just when I think I'm starting to follow it, the next picture shows me something different which doesn't seem to fit with what I thought was going on!  But I wasn't expecting much from that side of the game anyway, and I'm not playing it for a thrilling narrative.  I'm here to enjoy some puzzles! :)New mechanics are introduced slowly and it may take a little playing around and just clicking on things to see what happens, since there are no instructions whatsoever (not even pictorial ones).  There are also no penalties for failure, so unless you're very easily frustrated (in which case puzzle games may not be Your Thing!) then it's not a problem to just try clicking and/or dragging in various places to see how things work.  I thought I was stuck at one point, but I just needed to look at the puzzle and think a bit longer before realising what I needed to do.  I don't know how much the difficulty might increase towards the end, but so far there hasn't been anything too challenging and most of the puzzles only take a couple of minutes or so.  It does make me think, but doesn't leave me feeling like an idiot after scratching my head for twenty minutes and still not seeing a solution!I'm not sure if the game will really have any replay value after I've finished all the levels, but it seems like something I might come back to at some point if I just want a relaxing game to while away a bit of time.All in all, I found this game adorable.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles and would like a pleasant game that isn't going to make your brain hurt!  It would be great for just playing two or three puzzles on a break or while waiting for something, or you can sit down with your hot beverage of choice and spend a couple of hours on it.  :)"

Sure, you can go through the 70 levels in one go - took me about 90 minutes - but I love how they introduce new mechanics in the game. No text, no one telling you in any way how to procede. Just you and the puzzle pieces and the ""slots"" where you have to put them. I wish more games, in all genres, could find ways to do this. Most games today have way too much hand holding in them with maps bloated with icons - and a UI full of so many things that it actually takes away a lot of the ""feelings of the game"" for me personally. Great game.If this game would include, let's say, 200-300 leves - I would easily have paid 10£ for it.Great job Michal ""Hamster"" Pawlowski and Konrad Januszewski!"

But the troubles start soon: the pieces obstruct each other, and because the paths are pre-made, you have to shunt them hither and tither to make them fit (it's a little bit like playing with a railway). Then you need to mirror them, glue pieces together, turn them, shrink and grow them, and teleport them. While you are working your way through 70 levels, the pictures you create unfold a small story. You could probably play this with a pre-schooler and claim it exercised their spatial recognition (which jigsaw puzzles do).No, it's not difficult; but the music is soothing, and the manipulation is oddly satisfying. The game took me slightly longer thanHook, which has similar mechanics, andZengealso felt more satisfying.Recommended.You can findZenge: Starbornon many free flash game sites.

,Recommended,461840,33143125,Posted: 2 July,all,nerketur,"I must admit, when I started this game, the first few puzzles I thought were way too easy (for too long), and I almost stopped playing.  The (minimal) story is what kept me going, and boy am I glad I did.  The puzzles can get very challenging, though every time a new mechanic is introduced, the game does a good job of easing you into it.  It was a very nice game (once I got past the first few puzzles), and I would reccomend it to people that like casual puzzles.  Thats pretty much all this game is: logic puzzles dealing with how to get all the pieces to their ending locations.I didn't like all of the mechanics, as some wouldn't work very well in all cases.  It also wasn't always obvious if a piece would be able to slide into place, so a bit of trial and error was needed to figure that out.  However, I'm still very glad that I never got in a situation where I had to restart.  A few of the levels may potentially need a restart, but most, if not all,  are always possible to solve, no matter where you move the pieces.STORY:This game's story is told in pictures shown after evey successful completion of a level.  There isn't really much to it, but you follow this blue pawn eveywhere on his adventure with this doorway. No dialouge, no speech, no words at all, other than ZENGE and the credits, in the entire game.  There are lots of meanings one can put into the adventures by this pawn.  Part of the appeal for me is I was able to use my imagination to make my own story out of it.  Its akin to games like LIMBO for this reasonART:The entire game is puzzles and art.  Every time a new mechanic is introduced, art about it is shown.  Every time a level is completed, art is shown.  And puting all gameplay aside, the art is rather beautiful.  Simple, but well-defined, if you like art, you wil like the art in this game.  For a sampling you can look at some of the discussions abut the game.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay seems to be made more for mobile than for desktop.  Tap on a ""symbol"" to activate it.  Swipe a piece along the line.  Or drag over the line to select at which point to put the piece.  All of these work rather well, in most cases.  Sometimes, though, it won't do what is desired until you click the piece in the correct location.  Or maybe its just more than once.  I never really did figure it out.MUSIC:The music was good for this type of game.  pleasent to listen to, never too distracting.  It isn't too memorable, though about ten-ish puzzles before the end, the music seemed to just stop altogether.  I thought that fit with the story at that point (finally leaving the world instad of exploring, given mixed emotions, could very well lead to not wanting to leave) but perhaps it was unintended.OVERALL:Minor gameplay issues aside, I think this is a wonderful game, well worth the less than $1 i paid for it.  I'd reccomend it for people that love puzzles, and like logical thinking, but don't want an impossile challenge.  Every puzzle was solvable in under 10 minutes; most under 3, a lot under 2 (there was one puzzle that had me stumped for a little over 6 minutes)."
,Recommended,461840,26643059,"Posted: 17 November, 2016",all,Mandelbrot,"In this game you basically assemble 70 jigsaw puzzles. The catch is that the puzzle pieces can only be moved in certain ways, and they can only be flipped, rotated, or teleported in certan locations. This is what gives the game its difficulty. Even then, I was able to beat it in just over 100 minutes. One shortcoming is that the puzzle mechanics are not explained and must be learned by observation."

The soundtrack is quite peaceful and sets a good atmosphere.Game ran almost flawlessly for me, in windowed and fullscreen mode.  The one weird thing I noticed, was the background music stopped working during the final 10 stages.This felt like a tablet game, but the click and drag mechanic worked well with a mouse.Its an inexpensive puzzle game, with many neat mechanics, including; connecting pieces to form larger pieces...flipping pieces...teleporting pieces...and more.  The different mechanics all add to its uniqueness.It has a single achievement (which unlocks after completing the final stage) so its especially worthy of a spot in your library if you are a into 100% games.I'd say this game takes roughly 2 hours to get through all stages, pending your skill level of course.The final stages with the color switches that also combine all the other mechanics are by far the hardest part of this game.Overall, I recommend this one, its inexpensive and the developer did a great job."
,Recommended,461840,22450482,"Posted: 16 April, 2016",all,Speed Luigi,"Okay, I just beat this and honestly, it was probably the best 71 pence I've spent in a long while.The thing that drew me to the game was the art style, I won't lie, I bought this game based on the screenshots a lone - I didn't read the description, or the reviews. I went in expecting a puzzle game similar to Hook, and to be honest that's not far off of what I got - an exceedingly polished, aesthetically pleasing, no-pressure puzzle game.It took me 70 minutes to beat - which when combined with the price paid, well exceeds the standard ""£1 to 1 hour"" rule that so many people seem to hold in such high regard - which personally I don't, if I enjoyed the experience then it was probably worth the price. Of course, it's a puzzle game, so YMMV - I could imagine people beating this in a solid half hour, or even taking several hours to never beat it.While it's not an excessively or inherently difficult puzzle game, it does require some decent spacial analysis - although some people will be pleased to hear that it seems to be impossible to 'trap' yourself and be forced to restart a board. I didn't manage to do that in any of the levels, although I did restart a few purely because I need to work something out from the beginning - that's just how my mind works when solving problems.If you're looking for a chill experience, with some wonderful art and music, with a little bit of story thrown in - I'd say go ahead and drop the sub-£1 fare for entry here and just have an hour of no worries or distractions, just solid puzzle solving fun."

I know that moves arent counted for relaxation reasons but I am used to move stuff right along and not being stopped all the time.but this little point doesnt stop the game from being a seriously epic piece of ART, especially considering the really short list of credits.I really hope there'll be another Zenge or an expansion or WHATEVER someday, because this has made the last 2 evenings the best that I had over all of 2016 up to now."

Simple concept, the music really put me into a puzzling mood and I dove in.  Did a few easy tutorial puzzles, then I started to notice what I was putting together.  After every puzzle completion you get rewarded with a scene from an adventure with a little dood in some surreal world.  I'm motivated to continue because I want to experience the story.  All the while the music is tremendously soothing.  Decide to alt-tab and check the store page.  It has overwhelming reviews, I agree.  And then I see the price 99 cents!

I got it along with over ten other games and intended to just have a quick look at it but I quickly got sucked in and kept wanting to solve ""just one more puzzle."" If you love puzzles, you should definitely check this game out; it has a lot of value for the price.You follow the journey of Eos, a ""lonely journeyman"" whose journey you follow in the gorgeous dreamscape-like pictures you unlock when you solve each puzzle. You may become immersed in the timeless sensation of pondering the puzzle mechanics, because the ambient, zen-inducing music somehow works together with the artwork, the puzzle types, and the complete lack of timers and counters to create a feeling of timelessness. It's oddly relaxing and mentally invigorating at the same time.Although there is no tutorial, the puzzles introduce new mechanics simply, allowing the player to become well- aquaintanted with a concept before adding it to other concepts in increasingly difficult tiers. I don't really want to detail puzzle mechanics here, since their discovery is part of the journey and the fun of the game, but for those who really wish to know:early puzzles simply involve sliding pieces in an order that doesn't overlap them or bump them together; later puzzles include such things as flipping, rotating, teleporting, shrinking and then enlarging pieces, and even activating colored paths by placing pieces over colored squares in correct sequences.For those who love solving puzzles for puzzle's sake and who enjoy relaxation, this game would probably be spot on. However anyone who prefers additional challenges or pressures might find this game lacking. I can certainly understand why the developers chose not to include any counters or timers and that choice certainly adds to the feel they seem to have been going for, but adding those features as options might have allowed more people to enjoy this game. I think it might have also been a good idea to number the puzzles to allow for cooperative puzzle solving, since many people love to discuss puzzle solving with their friends and discuss what points they've reached or share hints -- just my opinion.Pros:+ Great zen-like Ambient music with free downloadable soundtrack (wish it was on steam through the steam music player though)+ Gorgeous dreamscape artwork at the conclusion of each puzzle+ Tiered Puzzle difficulty; puzzle mechanics are introduced simply and built into more complex puzzles later+ Steam cards and 1 Steam achievement+ Relaxing; no time pressureCons:- no tutorial (this may turn some people off)- only 1 Steam achievement- no counters or timers so no way to measure success and compare with friends (this is not a competitive game!)I've been playing for almost 4 hours and I'm still not done, and I was solving the puzzles in 10 to 15 minutes, though I imagine it would vary a lot.

The general meaning and moral of the story is left up to the player’s interpretation due to its vague use of symbols, some which are both demonstrated somewhat in the puzzle mechanics. Personally the only thing i took home from the story is, 'never trust what a guy on fire tells you!'An enjoyable short-lived experience which serves its designed purpose which is to relax a player and to leave a player in a sense of contemplation. Personally however I would really love this style of game to jump in the world of 3D using the same art style and symbolism and a more detailed expose in the world of 'Eon' and his 'fiery Satan'."

It has the most gorgeous soundtrack I think I've ever experienced in-game. I sat down not knowing what to expect and got so enthralled that I was unable to put it down.I played through it start to finish in the one sitting (100 minutes [1.7hours] ). As far as I'm concerned that is a hallmark of an excellent puzler. It was just challanging enough to force me to think, keep me playing, but not so challanging as to exhaust my mental agility.The mechanics are simple, but just as I begun to feel bored with one, a new mechanic replaced the old, and then combined to produce a very engaging, enjoyable sequence of puzzles.Did I mention the soundtrack?

,Not Recommended,461840,32800281,Posted: 25 June,all,IceEye,"Don't let this games high rating fool you, I'm not going to make assumptions about other reviews, but i cant help but feel like the high rating is from so many people thinking ""Well... it was less than a dollar so ill give it a thumbs up""The game is by no means a bad game. its totally fine. But that little thumb means if someone asked me if they should play Zenge, I'd be inclined to tell them to spend their time elsewhere.ART:So the game consists of a series of puzzels that, when completed, reveil some artwork that is meant to reveil something about the ""story"". I see that this game has been tagged ""minimalist"". However I'd argue that the art is simply low effot/quality. To me, Zenge lacks the stylization and charm to be considerd minimalist. Rather it ends up giving the impression that the artist went with something they would have no trouble drawing a lot of. The art is very simplified, but it sure isnt minimalist.MUSIC AND SOUND:At first the music seems charming and relaxing, but even in the small amount that I played it, the music was starting to be very repetitive. There are very few tracks and they basiclly play on repeat thoughout the whole experience. Additionally, the sound effects of interacting with the puzzels themselves does not go well with the music at all. The SFX are very reminiscent of old web based flash games and I would not be supprised to find out they where simply downloaded from some an open source website.THE PUZZELS:Nothing much to say about them, honestly they do try to keep it fresh by introducing new mechanics every few puzzels, but makeing your puzzels more complex doesnt make them more challenging or more fun. Some might argue that it doesn't have to be challenging to be fun, but there is also nothing fun about zoning out and just sliding your mouse across a screen because the puzzels are so simple. Most people who want a PUZZLE game are hoping to find something, ya' know? Puzzeling? But Zenge falls totally flat in this area. The puzzels are so easy you'll take half a minute on each one at best. And that kinda of simplicity can't be pulled off without some impressive replayability. Of which Zenge has none.All in all, I don't hate it. But in a vacum, I wouldn't suggest you play it."

,Recommended,461840,32036889,Posted: 29 May,all,miezkatz,"Mixing jigsaw puzzles with rails, hooks and switches, Zenge manages to build an array of short, creative puzzles. It's clearly a mobile port with tap and slide controls and big buttons but that's negligible for the gameplay itself.The level of complexity grows with the player learning the self-explanatory functionalities and conditions. That is part of why the game is so short, the puzzles are rather easy to grasp but still encouraging enough. Each level is quickly solved and rewards the player with a colourful picture and a light sparkling sound. On the other hand, thoughtless trial and error attempts are punished with a clunking noise and vibrating, red pieces, disturbing the mood.Zenge is a visually and auditory pleasing game with relaxing chill-out music and slightly cheesy sea waves sounds. The graphics, i.e. the full pictures, are nice and clean with warm colours but nothing to get too excited about. The narrative about Eon consists of a series of pictures that is better described as a theme rather than a story.With a maximum average of about 2 minutes to solve a puzzle, it's easy to just breeze through the 70 levels in one sitting.

There isn’t enough depth to the puzzle-mechanic to make for anything approaching a challenge, and a puzzle game that isn’t puzzling is, by definition, a failure.There is a cute narrative to go alongside the puzzles, but they’re utterly divorced from the actuality of the puzzles. Watch a static cutscene that is totally unrelated to the action of solving the previous puzzle, then solve another underwhelming puzzle, watch another unrelated cutscene.

,Recommended,461840,30651343,Posted: 21 March,all,Dark Blue Monkey,"Zenge is a lovely little puzzler, all about fitting pieces together and slotting them into the right-shaped spaces on the screen.   similar in playstyle to Hook, the order in which you place the pieces means that you may not be able to place others, so you might have to backtrack to find a different order.The game is very soft and warming.  It's kind of like a warm cup of cocoa, while wrapped in a snuggly blanket on a summer's evening.    The levels take anywhere from 5 seconds to 4 minutes to finish, and there's around 60 of them, I think, so it takes three or so hours to play, perhaps a little more if you're not so great at imaging how things look when rotated or flipped.The pieces can all move around on a track, and when you click them together, you can pick up more pieces and move them about.  As you play through the game, a wordless story unfolds of a little guy searching for the pieces to help with the puzzle.  Each frame of the story is told between each level, and follows the little guy as he reaches for the moon, then uses stepping stones to head towards the sun, find its key, unlock it, and by taking the essence of the sun, to work wonderful magics, search parallel universes, and collect the various operators which help you move bits around the board.  they're rotators. flippers, shrinkers, teleporters and various coloured pads which unlock some moves which might not be previously possible.The background music is lovely, and just tinkles away in the backgound, giving the game it's lovely ambient air.  The art style is lovely too, with gradual fade-ins for the story frames , and how the pieces you're fitting together make those frames.The feedback when you make bad moves is very good, and in a subtle way makes you more careful.. in the same way that you know if you spill your cocoa, you're going to have to get up and find a wipey to clean up, which is far too much hassle, so better to just take it slow and relax...End to end I really enjoyed this game. It's got heart and soul baked into it.  It's not hard, and very seldom does it throw you a level which needs more than a few minutes of playing about..  there were two which required you to fit some pieces together in a specific place, although other places should have worked just as well, but they're not too frequent.Very well worth my time, and I feel very relaxed and like I've experienced a lovely fantasy tale too."

Good use of colors and the wallpaper style images at the end of each puzzle were very enjoyable to look at.  Many of the art pieces, I could easily see framed on someone's wall in their home/office.  Even me.  The more complex puzzles are quite clever and creative.  The only trouble I had were in the later puzzles; I'm a little color blind and some of the final puzzles required color matching to unlock movement for other pieces around the board.  Some of the colors were difficult to distinguish, but it didn't mar my experience at all.Worth the $0.99."

This is a serene geometric puzzle game that makes you think and stretches your spatial awareness muscles, rewarding you with beautiful, ethereal art after solving each puzzle. While the puzzles were mostly easy, some were more ""tedious"" or multi-step to solve: not a bad thing, and indeed I wish there had been more of these more challenging sequences where you had to really consider the order of your actions and think several steps ahead. The art was really stunning and other-worldly; I would have loved to explore those worlds further somehow - perhaps some additional achievements (this game only has 1) or mini-games could be a nice way to allow players to extend their stay in this most surreal of lands. Highly recommended for puzzle lovers who are looking for something a cerebral that's not too much of a commitment."

The game does not have instructions, but teaches you game mechanics as you go.

The player is presented with shapes that fit together to form a solid tile (which is generally NOT rectangular). Your goal is to move the pieces along one of the pre-set paths to make them fit. In the early game this generally means moving a few pieces a single time to form the tile. Once the tile is complete a frame forms around it, filling out the screen, and revealing a single frame picture of an ongoing story.With each stage new complexities are added, and every so often new tools are given (like spots where you can rotate, flip, or teleport a piece.) Level design is tight in that each of these additional tool spots is absolutely necessary to complete the level.The game mechanic overall is one of puzzle solving by working with your sense of spatial awareness to help you decide which moves to make and in what order. You get all the time you want and there seems to be no ""botcha"" moment where you break a puzzle to the point where you cannot recover and eventually solve it.In addition to being a great puzzle game the soundtrack is brilliant. It's calm, soothing, and sedate, helping make the puzzle solving experience charming and fun even when you are giving yourself a good head-scratch trying to figure out what moves to make.The picture-book reveal of the story is also a pleasant, ethereal experience of your little minimalist ""person"" on a fantastic journey.Overall the mechanics, soundtrack, and graphics are all stellar. The only place I see room for improvement is in the number of available levels. I finished the entire game in just over two hours. Granted, I have good spatial awareness, but I'd still have liked to see more levels. The mechanics should allow for a nearly infinite number of combinations, so perhaps the developer will expand on them or allow workship support at some point.I give it a 9.5/10. Excellent, relaxing puzzle game that's just a joy to play."

No tutorial was needed and it's always clear what options you have available. The music and sound effects were great too. The artwork was nice but it didn't really make the story clear - which is all right by me, not everything has to have a perfectly explained story.  This game is more like a song than a novel."

Since you aren't punished for mistakes, you will quickly learn them by clicking around. These new mechanics add a layer of complexity and a feeling of progression even if the overall difficulty of the game stays on the easy side. The 70 levels took me about an hour and a half to complete, which is the lenght I would expect from a 1$ game.The art style is simplistic and pleasing for the eye, as you can already tell from the screenshots of the game. It's a goldmine of wallpaper material.The soundtrack feels gentle and calming and ties in well with the other aspects of the game, making for a soothing and enjoyable experience.The story it tries to tell through pictures at the end of each puzzle was confusing to me, but I wasn't expecting any kind of narrative so I did not pay much attention to it anyways.Its hard for me to compare this because I am new to puzzle games, however I can say that it's an affordable way to try out this genre. I would recommend Zenge to anyone who likes slower paced games and is looking for a unique experience. If you are looking for a challenge, this game isn't for you."

I mean, you're not going to struggle that much to solve them, but they still can make your brain work a little bit.The game has Steam Trading Cards. So you can easily almost get full price you paid selling the cards.As you can see in the games' description, there is no move or time count. This means you can play and forget about everything. Doesn't really matter if your solution is not optimal or if it took a long time to find.The story plot is something interesting, it only uses images to tell you what's going on. You don't have to read anything, just see the beautiful images and imagine what's going on.If you also like puzzles and want to play something for relaxing, this is a good choice for sure.

It is a perfect puzzle game that will kill 3 or 4 hours but: You don't have to hurry through it or look up walkthroughs. It just presents you with one puzzle at a time that you can solve at your lesiure. Also easy to exit by just clicking Esc and the game will remember your position.There are different types of puzzle 'themes' throughout the game and some of us here had our prefrences, which differed, so there doesn't seem to be any part of the game that was unilateraly flawed.The graphics are easy on the eyes and the sounds are easy on the ears and it is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.And I should repeat this: ""It's only a dollar!""."

The game was simplistic and every solution felt right, that is to say, natural. None of the puzzles ever felt too confusing, though they were not always simple either. The puzzles also take a turn for the eaiser near the end as the story began to take the driver's seat. This was not unwelcome however, it was a nice way of slowing down the game for the ending.TL;DR - Good game; won't cramp your brain, but isn't always obvious either. Fun mechanics, and a somewhat obtuse and/or abstract story. One of the more enjoyable casual puzzlers."

The basic concept is to move tiles along paths to fit them together without running into other pieces. It quickly becomes more complex, with rotation, flipping, teleporting, and more.  Still, the game is quiet and meditative, with no pressures to finish - the story (told only through pictures when you finish levels) is minimalistic and pretty, and the game itself is calming. It's short but sweet (it took 90 minutes to play through the 50+ levels), and definitely worth its low price."

I wish I could rate neutral because I really wanted to like this game. The game has a nice piano track, even if it gets somewhat repetitive. As for the story told in the pictures, it seemed forced and nonsensical like it was trying too hard to be something its not. My biggest problem with the game a lack of challenge while completing the puzzles aside from the challenge of getting around the clunky click and drag controls where you're forced to click and drag every time the object changes direction instead of gliding down the tracks. This left me feeling impatient and I ended up less calm by the end of the game than I was going into it. The game isn't terrible, but its also not something I would recommend. :/"
,Recommended,461840,33650885,Posted: 19 July,all,Chonow,"It is a simple game that uses various elements such as move, rotate, paste, flip and teleport to match the pictures. The puzzle itself is modest, but the illustrations and music of the game are fantastic. As a gamer, I would like to recommend as a first game to my child in the future.Pluses+ Easy and intuitive difficulty. This, of course, may be a minus at the same time. But one thing is certain that there is no puzzle-specific stress.+ Think of it as a fairy tale with a puzzle. Perhaps if the illustrations were mediocre, this would be a big drawback.+ It is a great blessing to be able to enjoy such illustrations and music at a price of 1$.Minuses- It is ambiguous to say that it is a minus, but certainly the value of the puzzle game itself does not seem so valuable. It is a game used hands more than a brain.- Playtime is very short, but considering price, illustrations and music, I am sorry to say that this is a disadvantage.- For people who do not have interest in illustration appreciation, the value of the game falls sharply."

The art style is simple and geometric. The puzzles are also rather simple and geometric. The background music is peaceful and soothing.Personally, I felt the story was a bit incomprehensible without any text to elaborate upon the images, and the puzzles were quite easy, though not always obvious, sort of like untying a knot or tracing a maze with a pencil. Some people like that sort of thing. I must be one of those people.Overall, I found Zenge to be a relaxing, zen-like experience. I appreciate the artwork, the music is nice enough, and the puzzle mechanics are interesting. Though if you want to challenge your expert puzzle solving abilities, this probably isn't the game you're looking for.
