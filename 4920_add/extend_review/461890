The story is rich with the oppressive mood and ironic humour that Orwell and Kafka are famous for, and the style draws from Expressionism and Absurdism as well as cyberpunk dystopias.The game can be a bit oblique at explaining itself - it didn’t even seem to have a menu or interface. But that consistent feeling of alienation and confusion you share with your character is the whole point. Beneath its presentation, the game isn’t actually that complicated and can be completed in an hour.If you’re interested in story, atmosphere, general weirdness, and what games can be to create an experience, then this will reward you. It’s short, strange, ominous and bewildering, and if you can imagine that being a good thing then it’s probably worth your time."

As it stands, it's a passing setup for a puzzle adventure. While it's short and not very complex I think North does deliver on atmosphere, and the game mechanic with the letters home that function as a combined narrative and hint system works quite well. Final verdict is thumbs up but not much more - let's say 6/10 or so."

76561197989132185,Recommended,461890,28642158,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,pulp-reduced,"NORTH is a game that does not truly have a vision, or at least so it seems. It wavers or oscillates between both emotional states and maturity-levels in its attempt to posit some kind of critique or view of the refugee crisis. What's even worse is the unfortunate idea that it doesn't even remain consistent in its view. The main body of the game presents a nightmare view of being a refugee, a Kafkaesque alienation from the society one is in, but it ends in reconciliation, with the supposed refugee acquiescing. And not in a “what other choice is there?” of some kind of pragmatical mindset, but a jarring leap from the idea of this new society being Orwellian and invasive to it being better than the “fiery desert”, at least, thus alleviating the anxiety in regards to the surveillance, suspicion, lack of love and so on. I did not, however, follow the game's road from the former to the latter, and I struggle to see how this game in any way is “Dealing with the issue of the contemporary refugee crisis”.I don't necessarily think this is an awful idea or is not worth pursuing, games as news is a proper concept, and games as empathetic structures, or as conveyors of elements of empathy are what I foresee, and have experienced, as among the more potent mediums when it comes to putting you in somebody else's shoes, since that is more or less what is done. And within that model this game does not necessarily fail, it is just inconsistent. It conveys the idea of being in a foreign place somewhat well, albeit in a childish and naive way. The language is incomprehensible, the customs are tedious and confusing, people view you with suspicion solely due to the fact that you are different. But the obverse of what affects YOU negatively is the insight into how your own presuppositions, or your own pre-judgements affect how you view this new culture and how that serves to distance you and alienate yourself by virtue of these pre-judgements. People are blurred out and indistinct, overweight people are disgusting amorphous blobs, working is slavery, and so on. This is where the game contradicts itself even when it remains consistent in its overall view. The end result becomes a fairly hypocritical mindset where you are at once looking for the approbation of a different culture of your cultural heritage as you disapprove of the customs in this new, supposedly weird, world.Nothing about this is in reality particularly shocking or uncommon, but it makes the game say not much at all, or actually deal with a problem. There is no direction or voice that can be gleamed from this experience, at least from what I could gather. It expresses what is putative fact. It shows a great deal of naivety and immaturity in dealing with the subject. I believe this is in part due to the effort to gamify this topic. It doesn't uncover the core of these issues to the point where it would be possible to create a game-mechanic out of it proper, it never truly conveys the felt impossibility of changing circumstances, appealing to bureaucrats or the State more than with slight discomfort or inconvenience. There is the confounding nature of settling into a new place with new rules, and it reinforces that idea through ambiguity and oblique explanations. It hints at an understanding of the bureaucratic absurdity of modern society, but again, in a very unexciting way, devoid of nuance. It feels very much like a critique of a world that is not yet understood or have been experienced in a genuine manner by the one who is critiquing. Especially when the critique falls into acquiescence and reticence. The complete disavowal of a point of view through silence or acceptance of a new order seems to completely negate the points raised beforehand. Points that moreover have had to been valid to some extent to have felt necessary to bring up or especially in this case when a game has been created around it.Here we have to ask what NORTH is trying to do. I am not a refugee, so how can I understand this issue enough to fill in the gaps of what the game is not explaining to me? Is the queerness of the game meant to put me in the shoes of a refugee in a new country? Is this what explains the abstract architecture? The non-language? I can comment on these things because they are obvious, but what about the less obvious parts? In what sense does anatomy have a reason to be part of this game's presentation? Why is my home broken and filled with strange pictures? Many scenes of the game were to me strictly nonsensical, many times to such a degree as to make it funny. But fun never seemed to be the goal of this game, thus deeming many parts of it a failure, in my eyes.Failure can be fun, though, as I'm sure most people have a sense of. Things can be so bad that they become good, which is the premise of a lot of ironic enjoyment. But I do not think I enjoyed this game, unfortunately. I appreciate the effort of trying something like this, and I think with a matured mindset, something like this could be very interesting. If it was more personal, even, it would be more interesting. What is in NORTH seems largely to base itself on baseless ideas of conspiracies. An idea of self-importance and arrogance that is necessary to overcome if you are to partake in any society, at least if you are an everyday person. One is simply reterritorialized by the end of NORTH, as opposed to becoming-nomadic, or becoming-child, in the sense of not being opposed to the new.I regret playing this, in a way. It's an upsetting view of the world without the excitement that comes with understanding the way the cogs interact of a mechanism, or the parts of a machinic beast. It's sad in that it is ignorant and silly when it tries to be profound. It's sad in how it paints a world that doesn't exist. I'd recommend reading Kafka instead, his stories are closer to being universally human, he writes with force and excitement, through the drabness of any subject matter. Even the depressing can be exciting if expressed with competence, solely due to the vividness and vivacity that the expression has the capacity to evoke in the imagination. NORTH as a game seems confused and weak in its expression, but it's a valiant attempt. One that perhaps adumbrates a future of more exciting and heartfelt expression from Outlands.thinking is boring"
,Recommended,461890,28650513,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Daybreak,"North is an atmospheric First-Person, allegorical science fiction exploration game with simple puzzles and gameplay. The main theme it explores is the contemporary refugee crisis--from a western perspective I'd presume-- seen from the viewpoint of a refugee arriving in a foreign culture. The player character we control is a refugee that have just arrived in a stable city where he seeks asylum and citizenship. We follow him in said process as he periodically sends letters back to his sister telling her of his progress. The inhabitants of this dystopian society are represented as alienesque people that speak a language that we as players and the character we control don't understand. At one point we have to pass a test in the police station; it consists of selecting which short movies are appropriate and which are not, and while the whole test and the correct answer are absurd seen from our perspective from the real world. It functions naturally within the narrative to mold the player character into a potential citizen as a most noble cog in the machinery that is this city. Just like the test for Danish citizenship, at least a few years ago, consisted of a questionnaire based on more or less borderline pointless rote learning, in order to mold them into being part of a specific power structure.In the ending sequence of the game the player character shifted viewpoint in a way that came about as rather jarring to me, as though the developer ran out of time.  Regardless the games overall ambience, with its hyperbolically allegorical Science fiction setting wrapped in a dark cityscape and accompanying synthpop soundscape intrigued me for the first part of the game. At least it isn't sordid entertainment even if the game in its finished result is a bit rough and iffy. It breaks noble grounds for a modest indie computer game within the gaming sphere."

This makes it that much more enjoyable. It's brazen attitude of making you ""understand or gtfo"" is awesome. Despite this, I've completed the game in under 4 hours, so it's a shame it is not longer. While it's super fun to see a game released on Steam with a free personal version of Unity (soooooo Indy) I would pay big money for North 2. Other than the ""create only cubes"" simplistic way of level design, the music is among the best I've ever heard, and the scene inside the police station recognition facility blew me away. I stopped smoking weed a while ago but this game certanily made me wish I didn't! So grab a spliff before playing eh? Ultimately however, this game accurately portrays the life of an immigrant and the hoops one has to jump to simply establish a normal life in a new country (speaking from experience).

I got quite lost and annoyed at the beginning but once the ball gets rolling it becomes quite fun and engaging.One problem that I’m not sure if anyone else is having is bad performance issues. It runs quite slow in certain areas, especially the Mines and Church. The controls also feel pretty clunky and mouse movement feels slow. The art style was interesting although it could be refined a bit more. There are parts where the graphics look pretty bad and the Anti-Aliasing is terrible.Apart from that this is an interesting little game. For £1.50, it is a pretty good deal.

You won't regret it."
,Recommended,461890,28730952,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,VideoDameMaria,"(Contains spoilers.)NORTH is an experimental, atmospheric, unsettling game. It's short and frightening, not so much in a horror sense (although there are certainly horror elements here), but more in an existential sense. The problems it deals with are at their core very real and modern. All of this had me drawing comparisons to the free game the static speaks my name. Both deal with complex, contemporary humanitarian issues by rendering the player confused and increasingly hopeless. It puts you in the shoes of someone trying to cope with a miserable situation, and in the end without anyone to pull you out, getting lost in that misery.NORTH's ending is a gut-punch, if a little cliche. The player spends the entire game trying to attain legal asylum in a cold and unwelcoming city of the North, and at each progress point they send a letter to their sister who still lives in the war-torn South. The letters are really the only way for the player to understand what is happening to the protagonist. They're a struggled attempt to make sense of the environment and the puzzles they are being forced to solve. They're also the only source of backstory for the protagonist, letting us know where he came from, why he's here, and that he still has family who were left behind. The lettters are vitally important to both the player and the protaginist in these ways, allowing you to both log your progress through the game by recording your difficulties and to maintain contact with the one person who may be actually sympathetic to your plight.Then in the final sequence, right after you've proven your value enough to be granted asylum, the overlords of the North reveal that they have been confiscating and reading every single one of the letters you sent. ""For security purposes."" There's a point I wish I had screenshot where you're commanded to ""Right click to feel the irony,"" and doing so triggers the sounds of derisive laughter. Therein lies the sinful cliche, a moment when the player's already present genuine emotions get a bit soured by the game's attempt at driving home its point. It's a ""Press R to pay respects"" moment.But NORTH quickly recovers by closing on another letter, one clearly written not by the protagonist but rather by the North's government. It paints the picture of a man whose struggles in the city were his own fault for being ignorant, but who has ultimately triumphed over his shortcomings and become a happy and productive citizen of a civilization that is better than the South in every conceivable way. The letter concludes with an encouragement to his sister to join him in his newfound safety and fulfillment. Sinister icing on a cake of betrayal. The final title sequence plays, but this time instead of glowing white letters, we see the word ""NORTH"" presented in stark black on a dimming screen.This back-and-forth of moving, nuanced storytelling and heavy-handed design choices are pretty consistent throughout the game. NORTH has a problem of telling instead of showing. While the point of the game is to disorient players by giving them an alien landscape and bizarre objectives, its protagonist is somehow able to make impossibly better sense of things. The letters become Outlands' way of overcorrecting for this. You move around in the game, click a few things, and then read a letter that explains exactly what just happened and tells you what you need to do next in not-so-subtle red lettering. If this game is supposed to make us feel like a refugee, then why is the player's experience not congruent with the protagonist's? NORTH was built with the potential to be an appropriately frustrating puzzle game but instead developed into a vaguely-challenging walkthrough.Evey with all of this criticism, I have to give this game a thumbs up. It's egregiously rare for video games to tackle serious issues in a serious way. The refugee crisis is such a prevalent and ubiquitous international problem that ignoring it as modern media has is a massively shameful decision. NORTH is not shy about its subject matter. It's not so metaphorical that one could get away with dismissing it as being about something else. That the protagonist is openly gay and has been persecuted in the South because of this is an unexpected but realistic contribution to the seldomn-told video game narrative of the oppressed. As a bisexual brown woman, this unapologetic multifaceted representation is what sold me on NORTH.If you're looking for a gaming experience that dives boldly into the relatively uncharted waters of deep and complex social issues, I highly recommend you add this to your collection."

,Recommended,461890,22832307,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,Lazarus,"Played this game to the end, and I gave it a thumbs up because I enjoyed it, but I would say this is not for everyone.Firstly, the game is beyond the concept of indie - it's not designed to be friendly. The only thing you have to guide you through a dark, bleak city is the letters you send your sister. There is no main menu, no saves.If you love an almost cinematic art house feel in a game, this is great. If you don't, you will hate it, just like all the reviews of people complaining about a lack of direction, objectives and explanation. I'm not passing judgement on them, but they didn't like the game, so if you are looking for something a little more structured in that sense, you will not like it either.That being said, it is very linear, and while you can choose the order of how you tackle the main objective, there really is only that objective and one way that it can be achieved.The worst thing about the game was the controls. I am on a Mac, and the Mac version had frequent problems with the mouse - there were several points it became broken and unresponsive (playable, but only just) and also the mouse speed was not what I was used to. There were also parts that, seeing other people's screenshots and playthroughs, were not rendering right, like the Doctors area.But all these things were not going to stop me from finishing it and I must say it was enjoyable. This game is what you would define in music as a ""concept album"", and if you like that idea, then this might be a fun one for you. If not, don't get it."

If you like your hand being held as you go through interactive story telling, this is not the game for you.The first half hour is full of ""Wait what?"" moments but it's completely appropriate for the ideas the game is conveying. After that, it all begins to make sense and you can get quite engrossed in the experience and it can become quite scary in a psychological way.I only have two criticisms for this game overall. First of which is the inconsistency in the bio on the store page and the actual game, “Sprawling mega-city” is is not. In fact, there are only three floors of the map and the top only has one room. The second criticism is only a small one. At the end of the game (No spoilers) there are a bunch of dialogue boxes but one of them has a completely different tone all of a sudden and it really ruins the end of the game.However, the games message has not been lost by the end, you really feel like an Alien who has to jump through hops just to get people to accept you as a being.

The game gets this across very quickly and that is to its credit. From the first moment, you feel like your in an alien world and I found myself enjoying the actual game world throughout my short time in it. That being said, I got pretty tired with the overall experience pretty quickly. I believe this could be interpreted as the creators accomplishing their goal, as the objective is to confound and confuse you. However, I would say the game doesn't hit the mark, as the game play mechanics simply don't stand up.The game will confound you, but in the wrong way. The game mechanics boil down to, walk into a room, get information, read information and do exactly what the it says to progress. There is no self-discovery, no aha moments, at no point did I ever feel confusion at trying to understand instruction given to me an unfamiliar way. The game could perhaps have took some clues from older point and click adventures, which give almost no information and thrive on self-discovery through trial and error. This is not a new experience, and I think the game needed to ground itself a bit more in what has been done. Instead, the mechanics don't match the central themes of the game. You quickly discover that you can ignore anything that is confusing, as long as you simply walk everywhere and click on everything, the game will tell you exactly what you need to do.The theme is there, the tone is there, the art style really worked for me. What was lacking was the game mechanics. I appreciate what the creators did, I think its very clever and the end hit home for me. However, the game play itself was not enough for me to consider it a good game. It feels like they needed to go through more iterations of design before calling it the final product. The game play feels like it is far below what is possible to do while maintaing the themes and emotions they were aiming for, even on a budget."

After a nice stark synthesizer intro you are dropped into a weird city that feels like a megastructure along the lines of NaissanceE. There are no clues what to do, and it's tempting to quit because the movement is all slidey and janky. But lack of direction and clunky controls somehow add to the experience. Everything feels vexing and incomprehensible. Eventually you realize this is a puzzle game about migrating to a strange land. The puzzles aren't complex, but it all feels very awkward. Everything is ""off"" and your only link back to reality seems to be the letters you write to your sister. It took me about an hour of wandering around to complete a playthrough, and although the whole experience is surreal, as someone who has spent much of my life struggling with immigration and living in lands other than my birth country, a lot of it hits close to home. This is an excellent experience, a game that really elevates the medium. Highly recommended."

(The static speaks my name, another recommendation of theirs, also has this problem; I only suffered through it because I knew it was only like 5 minutes long.)There's also the two minute opening unskippable title screen, the pressing-enter-resets-the-game issue (forgotten debug feature maybe, but use an F key or something for crying out loud), the generally lower FPS than feels appropriate for any given thing I'm looking at (which might have something to do with motion blur per other reviews but I didn't even notice the blur) and the lack of even the most basic kind of progression memory (it's a one sitting game, and I've no idea how long it is)... I think I'm going to go refund this thing rather than have to split my ""Bad/Unplayable/Whygodwhy"" category out into a ""I can't play this unless I fork over money to a third party, maybe"" category. (YeahOver The VoidI'm looking at you...).Yeah, that's the particularly insidious problem with the mouse invert. While it should only take an if statement and flipping a sign in the mouselook handler to implement (seriously even alerting the player that e.g. I toggles mouse invert should take more work than actually making it work), there's exactly one workaround the user can use in all of the internets, and it's another 15$ or something piece of software that isn't even straightforward to buy. (It's called MAFMouse if you're curious.) Every other inverter I've seen or heard about, including autohotkey scripts and various little tray apps, works on the desktop but does nothing in a game.So it's really up to the developer to add this basic feature.Too bad, I really like odd surreal stuff to explore."
76561197988214044,Recommended,461890,25567685,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,WaylenS.,"tl:drNorth is a short, abstract game about a refugee, seeking asylum.The metaphors aren't really subtle but strong and bring home the point. Since it is really cheap and thought provoking i recommend it.IMPORTANT:The game doesn't really tell you what to do, but you will see a letter symbol in the corner from time to time. Go to a postbox, they are in the main areas of the city, there you will be able to read the letters and get hints on what to do.Technical Stuff:Besides the resolution options in the unity start up window, there aren't any menus and options inside the game. Occasionally the framerate drops, but since reaction speed isn't really needed, that's not really a problem. Only the WASD keys and the mouse buttons are used. No map, no inventory. The graphics are simplistic but suit the rather abstract symbolism of the game. The sound and music are eerie and fit the setting.Conclusion:It has its technical flaws and is pretty short, so it is not for everyone, but since it is cheap, I honestly don't think the game is overpriced. It puts you into the view of someone who isn't as fortunate as you, considering that a big part of the world's population doesn't have access to electricity, computers and an internet connection. It is a lesson in empathy, that i think is really needed in the context of the staggering amount of refugees in the world and the current refugee crysis and also shines a light on a lot of questionable things in western societies.My recommendation for everyone is: Step out of your comfort zone and step into the shoes of someone less fortunate than you. Give this game a try!Afterthoughts: !SPOILERS!The big theme of this game is the strangeness of the seemingly wealthy and developed society to the eyes of someone from a poor, harsh and dangerous environment.By calling the two places North and South the implications are pretty obvious, yet the devs didn't just bash on certain countries but left it abstract, which leads to generally recognizeable patterns and applicability.You live in the gutters, are distrusted for who you are and have to prove your usefulness and harmlessness to society. Oh glorious freedom.WORK! FOLLOW THE RULES! RENOUNCE YOUR OUTLANDISH RELIGION! TAKE YOUR PILLS! JOIN US! ASSIMILATE! BE HAPPY!The portrayal of dangerous, seemingly pointless work, distrust, state observation and surveillance, desperation, alienation and dehumanisation to the factors of usefulness and bare numbers are simple but effective and make you question the state of your own society. We expect total assimilation of people that want to join our societies, despite all the experiences, cultural bonds and beliefs these people had before, in total disregard of these person's personal value and rights. In conclusion of an fairly unregulated capitalism only two things matter: Your compliance and your(preferrably high value) workforce. This game makes these things recognizable and glaringly obvious."

Unfortunately, technical issues frustrated me enough to force me to stop playing very quickly.

Next time, please just hire more experienced developers, or test your game for longer, or do something to improve the technical quality."

The soundtrack is also really good and it suits the atmosphere really well.The only thing I don't like about this game is the dark city you start in, something about the atmosphere feels somewhat flat and strange in a bad way however, I got used to it after half an hour or so of play.This game is no doubt, worth the two dollars spent on it.

The graphics are weird and grainy. not in an artsy style but just weir.Yes i can see that the devs tryed to make a weird game that makes you think and doesnt need to explain anything but you really need to explain what the f*ck is going on.do NOT buy this. i have already made a refund request

Once you see the price tag it is a nice $1.99 and you decide to pick it up for yourself. Then once you first boot it up a start menu appears where you can choose the resolution of the screen for the game, full screen or windowed, and you can see the controls. Once you first boot the game up after the start-up menu, a long intro screens appears, rendering you helpless in skipping. Then the game comes on. You can't exit the game, press esc., or even change options, you are stuck in the game. The gameplay is boring unless you like playing games where you look and walk around aimlessly doing nothing. Controls are no clear and if you didn't read them in the start-up screen, you have no idea how to interact with items. GAMES BORING THE END!"

The graphics are okay... nothing fancy very flat, and the charecter just sort of glides which at times makes it feel like your sliding around. Certian areas have graphical errors that apear as black spikes across the screen.Overall an intresting sorty, and I am willing to check out other titles by Outlands, but this game feels like it is incomplete and if a little more had gone into development as well as a longer story, It could have been something fantastic."

He works hard, jumping through a handful of hoops, to prove that he´s not a threat, that he´s an actual refugee, that he is willing to work for everything he gets. It´s a hard life. But at least he can write to his sister, left behind in the south.It´s a cool concept. It´s an important concept. It´s not the most engaging gameplay. I recommend you just play it.

You have no other escape but finishing the game even if you have trouble understanding its rules. Which can be find reading your letters to your sister.So it is disturbing if you expect the usual game mechanics, but it fits perfectly the idea of the game. It is why I think it is a good game given the goal. Yet, the scenario and gameplay is a bit too litteral to have a real impact on your feelings.
