So u even with teh buffs wont get that Vip lvl under 1000€ spent ( THIS IS NOT THE 100% efficence reckoning but i gues u know what i wanted to say with this to spin over with buffs u are still far over 500€ and if u wanna dont pay and just play u CANT progress )Even if u ve that much money that u wouldnt care about 1000€+ then go and Spent it pls to People who needs a House  / clothes / food & water etc.Anything else to say? Oh ye ...Shame on u greedy Developer Bas.tar.ds ;) lu2 One of the most Antisocialized games ive ever played and seen ... sadly ... cuz gameplay without all this payshit is great
,Recommended,461910,29678910,Posted: 3 February,all,- Meskalyne -,"This is a funny and entertaining game mostly daily quest and farm.You have to farm mobs to evolve'em again and again to get bigger and bigger mobs.you can buy some items and mobs to raise faster in the game but you dont need to buy anything to compete. Time and daily activity is the thing, money save time.You are rewarded too with guild activity and social (friends).I'm atm level 70 top500 pvp and always looking for friends.Once you reach level 5, enter my code ""RCWEGR"" in friends invitation as 1st contact, so you will be rewarded with an Elite Lion III. This is a well-card for a beginner and this is rewarding me too with a monster card everytime different.Once we are friend, you can use my warlord (a super mob once  in a team) everyday (and from other friends) and get food needed to farm levels. Food regenerate all day long but not so fast. You can contact me in game too, for any question and I will answer you with all I know about the game (tips and tricks for newbies ^^)Rate this game good, cause it is, and have fun.Remember my friend ID : RCWEGRSee ya soon (and sorry for my english, I know its bad^^)"

,Recommended,461910,29442614,Posted: 23 January,all,Trilith,"i have played lots of games LIKE forge of gods, and having played it now, i would hazard a statement that all the other games were mimicing the master.forge of gods is a tactical rpg/moba.  unlike modern mobas however its not active style, its more of a pvp setup.  you get guilds, you get guild wars, and on your own pvp style matches.cons:there is a modicum of pay wall.   HOWEVER!!!!!  since on the reddit forum(reddit.com/r/FreeGamesOnSteam)you can get paid dlc for free, and i have... so far 5 free.  three of them came with premium gems.  every day on facebook they give away monsters as well, and you get the ability to draw them based on how many friends have used your shared guy.this is all logistics... how is the gameplay?PROS:  gameplay is perfect.  its a 2d flat field that moves left to right as you click advance.  you can litearlly move everyone around as many times as you want, and in some instances, you'll very quickly find that might be the only way to victory.graphically its very cartoon 80's.  you wont hate them.  every design is nice.  not overstated, not ""HERE IS 200 GIRLS WITH♥♥♥♥♥♥BIGGER THAN  THEY ACTUALLY CAN HANDLE""  oh no no.  there are females and they are drawn tastefully and a few have sex appeal.  its always done tastefully and never over the top.socially, this game's servers are NOT full of over entitled children.   you can chat globally or with your guildies.  guild wise i never found one not aggressive - but friendly.  some will enforce donations, etc.  just leave those and go to one that doesnt.overall this has a bit of an old school rpg feel graphically.  the enviroment isn't toxic.  you can get gamepacks for free on reddit, and they give away monsters almost daily on their facebook page.bottom line:  if you like tactical games with drawing cards, you should check this out.  i paid about 15 bucks and received tens of thousands of premium in game currency.  and i get packs when i see them onreddit.com/r/freegamesonsteamand you should too, if you get into it.  it has a story, it has EVERY way to upgrade your characters in game, you get your own castle to upgrade that will give you EVERY currency for free.  daily and overall quests send you tons of diamonds, monsters, etc.give it a shot.  you might like it.  its way better than any free to play games in this catagory.  you can buy in game currency but theres figuratively tons of ways to get them free without paying a single thing.WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?  ITS A SMALL DOWNLOAD DONT TAKE MY WORD ON IT GO CHECK IT OUT!note:  doesn't sync with the facebook/android versions."

,Not Recommended,461910,29459567,Posted: 24 January,all,MescudiRager,"Look I can understand if your potato can only run this, then you feel the need to play it, but other than that, no fun factor, repetitive, terrible UI, Even if you got the Promote Pack for free, which is so overpriced if otherwise I would still not recommend this game. There are many more free to play games out there which will give you much more rewarding fun. Don't waste your time. If you have a PC that can run anything else, stick to anything else. Seriously stay clear from this title. I'm still sitting with PTSD."

I spent at least a few hours every day playing. Today I logged in for 100th day and won 2500 crystal from the achievement. I ended up spending them all trying to get two evolving materials to evolve my warlord. Got only one of them. This is the first game that I will delete because of having ♥♥♥♥♥♥ drop on vital materials. Considering the fact that the warlord need to be eveolved several more times with the same eveolving materials, it seems I would be stuck here for ever. This 2500 crystal were equivalent of 50 Euro or more and I got only 1 of the materials. No way I am spending that kind of money with this rediculous drop rate."

I think even most pre-teens would find it boring after a short while.It is very simplistic, and I do not see where the player has all that much influence in creating characters.You do upgrade powers, but this does not a role-playing game make.I fully understand that the term RPG has been some what mutated as it relates to video-games from what the term origingally meant, but that doesn't mean that any game with any kind of structure where characters can be given additional skills/powers, etc. Is an RPG.I would call this an action-strategy game."

76561198066232946,Not Recommended,461910,29468709,Posted: 24 January,all,Yashua,Highly recommended to not start this money gap game.Not possible to normal play this game if you dont put lot of money in it cause of Food system who restorate 1 each 2 min and you need 20 to play 1 game of 20 sec to 1 min.And cause of game difficulty curve going difficult rly fast and then need to put money in the game to become stronguer or wait weeks.I recommend to play another good strategie game where you can actualy play :P cause in this game if you got no food you have to wait.I even was able to get all the dlc exept 1 for free cause of giveaway and i bought for 20$ and i got totaly stuck after 3 day of playing only and now i need to put more money or wait forever... dont make sense to me...Please stay away from this for your own sake.

76561198011571954,Recommended,461910,30201598,Posted: 26 February,all,Green,"Very fair FTP model. Pretty much treat it like an idler and check in on it every few hours and you will be hanging around the upper half of the player base in a few months. All of the dlc for this game IS free if you don't mind waiting. The devs give out free codes on FaceBook and other websites all the time and rotate which code is out at any given time. If you decide to play enter my friend code, TGSPDB this will give you a free unit and acess to my premium Warlord.If you decide to give this game a try and use my frand code hit me up with a private msg in game. I will be more than happy to show you how to progress quickly and will help you build an army that can accomplish early game goals and carry on to middle and end game."
