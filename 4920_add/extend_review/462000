76561197988023670,Recommended,462000,22698450,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,prawnzzie,"Since HoloBall just came out a few days before Cyberpong, I think many people will be wondering what the differences are and if it's worth owning both.In single player, Cyberpong VR is best described as VR Breakout with a dash of Tetris.  Blocks spawn at the back of the arena and slowly move towards you.  You destroy them with bouncing balls and powerups until a block makes it to your side.  Then the game is over.  There's strategy in how you save and use the powerups, and skill in juggling and aiming the many balls.The suprise for me was PvP multiplayer, where it plays like VR Pong.  There are no powerups or blocks, just returning the ball back and forth as it becomes faster and faster.  It sounds simple, and it is, but being face to face in VR with your opponent brings so much to the game.  It's an absolute blast.  Shoutout to Shaquille who beat me easily 5 games straight.Cyberpong will have you moving all around the required play area, but it doesn't push you to swing with the same vigor that HoloBall does.  I've had to take a break for a few days from HoloBall for my arm to recover.  Cyberpong brings my pulse up, but doesn't wear me out.TL;DR: While Cyberpong VR and HoloBall look similar, they play very differently, and both are great fun.  The online multiplayer in Cyberpong VR is an absolute must try."
76561197991986059,Recommended,462000,22713989,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,Shaquille O'Wheel,"I'm guessing a lot of people are considering whether to buy this or Holoball.  Well, here're my thoughts as someone who owns both:**NOTE: The following paragraph no longer applies; the Cyberpong team quickly changed the mechanics of the game to allow for smashing and controling the ball to a much, much greater extent.  You don't have to, but you can speed up the pace of the game quite significantly if you do.Holoball responds to how you hit the ball more than Cyberpong.  Holoball really is more like raquetball, and if you're looking for that smash-hit feeling, then Holoball is what you want.  For me, smashing it ends up straining my elbow after a short play-time, and I start feeling it there before actually working up a sweat.Cyberpong is more polished, period.  The powerups, the tetris-meets-breakout singleplayer mode, the various characters that have different paddles (although, let's be real here - the default paddle is the best paddle), all of that just makes for a more fleshed-out game.  I played through Holoball and was done with it after about an hour.  I'm still playing single player Cyberpong trying to best my highest time.And finally, multiplayer.  I'm reserving my judgement until I see what the Holoball team does, but suffice it to say that this is the main selling point for Cyberpong right now.  It lags a bit, but only the interactions between the ball and the other player.  You never have a problem making contact with the ball (i.e. the ball never lags through your hand or anything).  It's incredibly simple - just barebones pong against another person - but that's all it needs to be.  Facing off against another human being who can wave to you, taunt a bit, sympathize when something crazy happens.  You feel the company, and it's fantastic.All in all, I'd recommend this over Holoball as of right now."

I am currently #3 in Global Ranking in single player, right at 17 minutes. The game might seem simplistic and too easy at first, not giving penalties for losing your ball like most brick breakers do. But after playing a few hours did I realize that the real goal in single player is to stay in the game as long as possible. The difficult exponentially scales, and it becomes intense and chaotic to stay in the game. Kudos to the devs for making one of the more polished games for VR early on, although there are a few serious bugs to be fixed.Get this game, and look at it as a workout program, I think you'll end up loving it as I do."

,Recommended,462000,22747847,"Posted: 1 May, 2016",all,Kumquatxop,"Like A-10 VR, I think this game suffers from its name.  This is not a pong game -- it's not even close to what Holoball is trying to do (other than the fact that the game happens to involve a ball).  If this game were named Cyberarkanoid VR, or Cyberbreakout VR, or anything other than containing the word 'pong,' I feel like there would be less unfortunate comparison with something it's not.In any case, this game is super fun, and a compelling little arcade blockbreaker.  The force feedback of the paddles is well-implemented, and the later stages of the game get good and frantic.  I find myself wishing for more single-player modes, but the one mode it has is really good.  I've demoed it to a couple folks as a room-scale experience and everybody has liked it a lot."
,Not Recommended,462000,24678979,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,Bassem,"My main problem with this game, and it's a huge problem I think, is that it maps the playable area to your chaperone bounds exactly.Couple that with the tiny size of the paddles, and this means you'll be swinging your Vive controllers - at high speeds - right at the bounds of your chaperone, which is usually where you have walls and floors and furniture and what not. I can't tell you how many times I've hit my controllers against stuff, and how many balls I've missed because I'm too afraid to swing at my chaperone bounds.I can't believe the developers haven't thought about this. Look at Holoball, which does it right: in Settings, you can set a padding area from your chaperone that basically narrows down your playing field so you're not swinging at the edges. And the paddles are larger in Holoball.In Cyberpong, the default paddles don't even extrude past the controller. No, for that you have to use an ""ability"" or select another character with long but extra narrow paddles. Utterly ridiculous.Beyond that, it's... eh. It's way too claustrophobic. And the balls are slow, and the shape and position of the paddle makes swings awkward."

Originally I posted this as a negative review, but have now changed it to a positive review.  I left the original review below for any of you who may be experiencing the same issues I was.Long story short, the issue ended up being a mixture of hardware configuration issues.  The odd thing was that other games I played were fine, but this one seemed to bring those issues to the surface.  Even though the SteamVR Performance Test said that my system was more than ready, UserBenchmark correctly identified the issues that needed to be addressed.  Once I resolved these issues, Cyberpong VR worked flawlessly.This is a great game to have in your library.  It really takes Pong to a much higher level.  I love the neon graphics.  Now I just need to work on my stamina so that I can play for longer than 10 minutes at a time :-)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review:Appears to be filled with bugs!The Good:Great visuals for a Pong game.  This isn't the old Pong game from the 70s.  Between the virtual stage and the variety of in-game play, this one would actually keep me entertained....if I could get it to work properly.The Bad:I have about 20 VR titles, and I haven't had any issues with any of them, except this one.  With this one, the screen keeps flashing from a black screen to the game (every couple of seconds), making the game unplayable.  As for my hardware, I'm a Vive running a Asus STX Strix 1070 08G on a i5-6600 16GB Win10 platform.  You would think this would be more than enough hardware to throw at it, as none of my other apps seem to complain, so there must be an issue with Cyberpong VR.This game has potential to be one of my favorite apps, if I could get it to run as designed, but until those issues are addressed by the developer, it pains me to say that I'm going to have to give this two thumbs down."
