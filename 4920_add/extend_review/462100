By purchasing this title I'd like to support the developers on their fight against the troll that is currently abusing the copyright system for reasons only one with a twisted mind could fathom, and putting the livehoods of many legitimate content creators at risk in the process.Sirs, your fight WILL be won.Can't wait to see this title's full release; I love shoot'em-ups :-)"

Contract disputes should be settled in court, not by throwing tantrums on the internet.This sort of game usually isn't my thing and I am absolutely terrible at it. I played less then an hour before I posted this, and I must have sent a hundred of these poor pilots to their horrible death already. I might actually be a bigger threat to humanity and it's survival then the g'ell at this rate. It succeeds beautifully in evoking that feeling of older arcade style shoot'em up games. I could easily see this in a retro style cabinet, eating my quaters as I try to fumble my way through learning the patterns of just one level of it.The new soundtrack fits the game much better then the old one. From the videos I saw of pre-pull gameplay, the soundtrack was competent but really slow and quiet for an action game like this. The new music has more pep to it, which matchs the action alot better. My advice: When you guys win the case, just let the old tracks rot and keep the new ones.All and all, its a good game. Its a step out of my comfort zone, but ended up being a good experience. Its got me looking forward to the point and click."

You can buy a lot of different ships, with different stats and weapons. The gameplay itself reminds me of Life Force and Parodius. This game brings back my fond memories of me playing Parodius as a kid for so many hours.I can fully recommend it."

,Recommended,462100,33467377,Posted: 11 July,all,Echoes,"Very fast paced shooter that throws enemies and bullets at you. The graphics are colorful and bright, with the stages showing some variation (night/day) between runs. The current soundtrack is a placeholder due to a dispute, which is currently being worked out in court, but what's there for now is upbeat and energetic.Instead of giving you a set number of lives, the game lets you purchase more pilots for your next playthrough using the points you collected while playing. The better you play, the better your chances will be on your next run. The power ups can be spun around your ship and made to merge with each other into larger pickups, giving you a larger boost than collecting them while they are still small, but watch out for the bullets!Overall a fun game, and the people at Imagos really deserve your purchase. Get this game."

It's more like a ""ship hell"", because I've never seen so much enemy ships at once on one screen.

76561198086118787,Recommended,462100,33481983,Posted: 12 July,all,Jestrom,"I've begun doing early impression reviews.  I'll play the 2 hours we're affored before a potential refund and make my descisions of a game based on how it starts off.Starr Mazer does this wonderfully, it knows what it wants to be and throws you into the action to learn off the bat.This game is sink or swim done right.So let's talk gameplay-The gameplay itself is fluid, you learn quickly how to play and what to do .  there's no hiccups or confusion as you progress and any sort of significant shift or change in either scenery or enemy formation is broadcast by voiced lines.The emersion is fantastic, not once was I pulled out of it by any unusual stutters in either gameplay or character.You'll be shooting down heavy waves of foes, pressured on every front and challenged differently in every level you reach (I only managed the 4th stage before this review).The game is challenging, but in no way punishing, if you die you know you're the one to blame and beter yet you'll learn form it.The bread and butter of the Game is Carbonite, dropped by enemies you slay and better yet able to be combined by luring the floating particles together for increased bonus and point score.this directly relates back to my ""Sink or swim"" comment as this itself can be a gamble, you need to navigate around this stuff and lure it together as it slowly follows you like a powerup, but the enemies will not be keen on letting this happen and do not slow down.  Bide your time and keep an eye out on enemy fire, a bonus means nothing if you're dead.BUT Carbonite does more than just fuel your point score, it fuels your WEAPONS!  While your Weapon doesn't peter out it will become a pea-shooter if you let it, you can't waste shots and avoid enemies or you'll find yourself slowing down and struggling.Don't cover, show no fear.  Be bold and you are rewarded!This doesn't even cover the enemies.No game can excel with boring repettitive enemies or overly powerful ones.  Lucking for you this game has niether!Enemy patterns aren't predictably scripted, sure you'll run into similar mashes of them each time you play the level, but there are always a few variations to keep you on your toes.Better yet each stage will feature new enemies with new attacks and challenges from stage hazards to enemies that will even abuse it to thier advantage.You aren't helpless though, there's an excellent variety of weaponds and specials available in a random mash when you select your pilots.You'll earn your Pilots by playing the game, the better you do the more Pilots you will be able to purchase for combat, but it goes beyond that with different packs and playstyles.Mix it up!Scenery and Music-The transitions for the background are fantastic.  The color blending isn't too loud or vibrant and won't distract you from the matter at hand which is kicking Alien Kiester.You'll go from a Planet in ruin to space and the hazards beyond as you progress fighting off the Gr'ell fleet ensuring you'e never too bored of what you're passing through.As for the music, it's beautiful.My favorite is currently in the first stages second act once you've entered the stratosphere.  You'll fiond the tracks always match your location and keep you rocking as you punch holes in alien cockpits and make scrap of fine engineering.Voice Acting-You may find it surprising that this game features voice acting, unusual for a sprite-based shooter.  But as you recieve your orders from a deep-voiced smart-mouth Cat General you'll chuckle.The pilots all differ in personality and gender (and possibly species?  I think I hired a lizard but he died a little too quick with an experimental weapon) from fast talking city-slickers to rural homegrown farm-girls.Overall I feel it gives the game good character as you get slightly attached ot these people only to see them die horrific explosive deaths.So yes, I do recommend this game.  For an early access it's on track to becomming a fantastic release."
76561198026089841,Recommended,462100,34553239,Posted: 28 August,all,ibrandon,"Most of the reviews are talking about the surrounding controversy so I thought I'd write an actual review of this game.This is a normal shoot em up game like Gradius but what differentiates itself from other games of the genre is the roster. Once you die, you will then move on to your next ship with different stats (Chance of death on hit, ship speed and Carbomite attraction) and weapons. The score you get in the game from collecting Carbomite also acts as a currency. You spend your currency on more ships and you could buy one really high powered ship for 100k + or loads of different ships to have many lives but will generally be less powerful. The different ships also have different pilots. The pilots don't really do much but add character to the game. All characters have been voice acted but the voice seems to be randomly assigned to a pilot. Sometimes I will see pilots who look like a young girl but have the voice of an old man which is odd. Hopefully each pilot could properly be assigned a voice during development.There are many different types of weapons from single shot high damage guns to rapid fire machine guns or spread shot guns and more. These weapons wil be automatically upgraded when you collect enough Carbomite which drop from enemies. There are 3 levels of upgrades for each weapon. One stat you will see on different ships is Carbomite attractor. This determines how well you pull Carbomite towards you. This is important because you can pull two pieces of Carbomite together to make a bigger piece of Carbomite for a bigger boost to the upgrades of weapons and a bigger score. Bigger score means more money. More money means bigger and better ships on your next run.The controls are ok but can be very painful after the first level. Due to the movement acting like a digital input even when using a controller, this means that you can only move in 8 directions and always at 100% speed. This is only a problem when trying to manoeuvre through a barrage of bullets and it feels so much more difficult because you can't make small adjustments well. The HUD doesn't help with this since I have tried dodging bullets and flew in the top corner of the screen but I went behind the HUD and I couldn't see where I was and I got hit.Once you lose all your lives, you start back at the very beginning of the game but you keep your score to buy more ships. This is a really cool idea which I would be ok with if I could save my game somehow. I love playing the game but I have this small amount of dread when playing it. I would get to level 3, die and start from the beginning but with a huge score for better ships to help me on my next run. But if I want to have a break, play something else for a bit, I will lose my score and I will have to grind my score back up again every time I open the game. I could play for 10 hours and die but feel like I have to keep playing even when I don't want to just to keep my progress. If you aren't prepared to play the game for hours and hours non stop, you might as well just play something else which is a huge shame. Please save our score once we quit the game.The levels are very VERY difficult, at least for me. I have only made it to level 3 once, and I do not know how many levels there are. Once I reach the end of a level, it feels so satisfying despite having done the first level around 10 times.Despite the negatives, the game is still tremendous fun due to the great soundstrack and sound design, the varied ships and weapons, the cool enemies that work really well and the unique way of buying lives and ships. I think for £7 though, it's hard to be dissapointed."

If you saw those videos and screenshots up there and thought, ""I do usually dig games like that,"" then quit dithering and get it. It's so good. It's so fun. It's very challenging in a way that feels very fair (98% of the time). There is a crazy high level of polish in everything -- mechanics, controls, art, audio -- especially for a game that's still labeled ""Early Access."" It's a high quality game that achieves what it sets out to do.Even while DSP completely succeeds at tapping your nostalgia circuit (by giving you something you didn't realize you were missing so much), it also suceeds at being really clever and original in a lot of important ways: there is a light roguelike layer in the pilot system; a nice variety of interesting weapons; just enough randomization to keep things interesting; limited but rewarding persistent unlocks; there are a lot of little extra mechanics to discover as you play.Full disclosure: I do know the folks that made this game irl. We're not exactly BFFs throwing sleepovers and watching scary movies in our footie pajamas, but I can tell you they're very cool and very nice people. I can also tell you that I'd be saying all the same things even if I didn't know them.

I'm more of a hack n slash kinda guy and don't really have the skill for this - the furtherst i got was to the boss on Act 1 Stage 3.  Still, if you like 2d shooters then this is a pretty cool and very well made little game.

You decide weather you like a big squadron of weaker ships or a few stronger ones. Also the weapons play fundamentaly different. The Gauge system that let's you use your special quite frequently, at coast of temporary base strength works well for me. The game gives you quite some stratagies at hand.It needs howerver some work in areas of enemy types, (though quite different formations already help  freshen the fight up.) Also some Areas in terms of level hazards are getting quite repetitive.Anyway, the basics feel good, the grafics are great (especially pilots and squard ships!), its a good start from here!"

The music that they recently added sounds amazing -- and in general, it sounds orders of magnitude better than the old music that was burdened by a certain composer's insanity.

Though I personally struggle to progress in this game due to my less-than-average playing skill, the beautiful graphics, killer soundtrack, and stellar effects keep me coming back to try to get farther. Metrics such as accuracy and destruction percentage make progressing more than just a high-score effort. DSP includes some creative elements such as the pilot hiring system and procedural generation of ship weapon loadouts. One feature I'd like to see is the ability to choose the order in which your pilots will deploy.

For such a chaotic style of gameplay typical to bullet hell, it is easy to understand what is happening and you wont find yourself dying to hard to see dangers.

Randomly generated pilots and ships means that the experience is always fresh and unique, and avoids becoming too monotonous by repeating the exact same experience every time. For such a low price point it is an amazing deal, and absolutely worth it to anyone interested in a good bullet hell and a fun game to compete against your friends in for a highest score.

Tracking the increasingly baffling story of an ex-contributor's copyright system abuse via SidAlpha's coverage was something to behold.And the game being shown in the background of his vids, this game, looked really fun. After playing it for myself, I can say that it is really fun.What you have is a difficult but fair sidescrolling shooter in the Gradius/R-Type vein where you're trying to mow down an invading alien fleet through space pilot after space pilot, each with their own weapon configuration. This really is a game that's meant to be mastered, dodging bullets and incoming enemies left, right, and center. I was at the edge of my seat maneuvering around deadly projectiles and ships.The health system for your ships is also interesting and fun, letting you survive taking hits if timed just right. It's an interesting mechanic that I haven't really seen before in other games, and adds a little bit more fun factor to the game.But if you do run out of ships, you start anew with another fleet. You do this by opening packs and paying for pilots with your score. With randomized pickings, you'll have a lot of variety to choose from, and different ways to play. Maybe you'll rely on a few strong and expensive pilots to carry you through the game, or maybe you'll recruit cannon fodder by the dozen in order to push back the invasion - hey, it's what you gotta do in an alien invasion. It's a very fun implementation of the trendy ""roguelike"" elements that fits this kind of game.Add to that a good pixel aesthetic and really nice musical works, and you've got a good package.My only complaint is that there's no good save feature, I'd like to space out my sittings for playing this game. I've also played this game with a controller, so your experience may vary if you use a keyboard for this game.That being said, this is very playable as a complete game, let alone a Early Access title. This is a very fun game, and I'd easily recommend it to anyone hankering for a shump-style game.Get meowt there, pilots!"
,Recommended,462100,33728874,Posted: 22 July,all,AzureJahk,"Bought this to support the devs through the spurious dmca takedowns. I generally don't go for shmups. The last one I played seriously was R-Type II on Gameboy. Im not really in to rougelikes/lites or score attack games either...I am loving this game. Each pilot has so much character both in terms of writing, voice acting etc but also in terms of gameplay. I love the slow firing weapons that pierce swarms but against single strong enemies it becomes a long duel dodging shots and counter firing.When you have a fast firing ship you can tear throw strong single targets but swarms overrun you like the defence of Zion in the Matrix films. Every ship has its own niche so it never becomes too easy and if you die, your next ship may be better suited.Your score is your currency to buy pilots, which perform double duty as loadouts and lives. Do you buy lots of cheap pilots and use them their dying explosions as a way to forcefully plough through or do you go for a single good ship and just 'git gud'. When you fail and have to replay a section it doesn't feel like a punishment or a waste of time. Your great run that just failed will buy you an even better squad to make this next run better. Death as progression and reward scaling up with performance. The better you do the better you can do.The chance to survive thing is interesting too, sometimes you mess up but get away with it. Instant relief then immediately back to tension. I assume if you get hit whilst the yellow the line under your portrait is in a green section you live since it seems different for each pilot (Think Tidus' limit break in Final Fantasy X). If so I can imagine advanced players will be able to use that tactically for some crazy skill depth.This is very much a modern game with a retro aesthetic. The controls are spot on, the game is beautiful in motion (screenshots don't do it justice). Instantly playable with skyhigh skill ceiling. This feels in no way like an early access game. Usually you have a mess of a game that needs refining all over. This is more akin to a playable demo right now. It seems mechanically finished and the production quality is great accross the board, but only the first act is available.I look forward to the inevitable design decision discussions about his game in the community."

,Recommended,462100,33551234,Posted: 14 July,all,TN Hoff,"A suprisingly fun and truly addictive arcade shmup with a twist.This game sets itself apart from its peers with its mechanics; lives-per-run are represented as distinct, procedurally-generated pilots - each with their own stats, weapon loadouts, ships, and voice acting. Stages feature procedurally-generated enemy formations to compliment the pilots.The music, effects, voices, pixel art, and gameplay all come together to create an outstanding experience; I have a handful of much more expensive shmups in my library, and none of them are this fun. For ten bucks, this is an absolute must-buy.In my personal opinion, the level of difficulty is spot-on and well balanced, especially for an early access game. It respects the player by presenting a real challenge without being totally opressive.

,Recommended,462100,26431936,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,malchitos,"A very interesting Shmup with cool Roguelike elements. It hits you with this beutiful 80's influenced pixel art and music. Then it has such quaint dailog going on some of the time. You have to laugh at the terrible puns the cat general says. At first start you are given three pilots. This game doesn't use lives or lifebars. Instead you buy new pilots with your score. Each pilot is randomly generated. From their cool little UN Squadran avatar in the upper left hand corner to that forementioned quaint dialog(which is spoken in stereotypical fashion).  Each pliot has a different type of ship which has different types of weapons. You power these up with stuff that comes out of exploded ships called carbonite. You can craft higher grade carbonite for greater powerups if you fly around them and use airdrafts to make them collide. Unfortunately you are constantly losing that power up as you use the weapons so it is a battle to keep that energy coming(I think this is the only flaw in the game.) Also each pilot has a bar under their avatar. The bar is randomly filled with grey. During play a line scrolls back and forth on that bar. If you are hit while it's on grey, the pilot will juke and jive. Thus he will escape from exploding.  When you lose all your pilots you are send to a screen where you can use your score to buy more, then you go back in and start from the beginning again.It's an early product but already shows great promiss. So far their has been a few interesting occurences in the game. During Halloween the enemy sprites were replaced with horror type things. Over all it is a great time killer with easy get in and out play. Of all the games I've bought recently(including Starbound and Star Dew Valley) I find myself coming back to this one."

Each run earns you currency that you can use to buy new pilots that act as ""lives"" - a very cool concept. There are enldess combinations of pilots, ships and weapons - not to mention they have names like Storm C Brashbender or Warp N Winddagger. What's really cool is that there's TONS of voice acting for them, which you wouldn't expect in a shmup.There's a Cat Admiral. Cat Admiral is the best.The action's as fast and furious as you'd expect, with a twist - you get hit once and you die, with the exception of Pilots that have a ""safe to hit"" meter which a constantly scanning cursor may or not may be in when you're hit - basically the bigger the ""safe"" area the more chances you can survive a hit, and the more expensive the pilot.This is a visually stunning game. It's pixel art done right. I semi-audibly gasped when I went above the clouds for the first time. You seamlessly go from planet to sky to space, the ships and weapons are incredibly varied and cool looking, basically retro games ""as you remember them"" - that is, a lot better looking than the classics were, but retaining that aesthetic.Music's one of the highlights of the game. I won't go into what and why, just listen to it. Really gets you pumped to do another run, every time.You've got to really be on your toes with this game - whenever your ship dies the next one instantly replaces it and is thrown into action, so careful of enemy ships or bullets when the switch occurs.If you're a fan of retro sexy shmups, get Starr Mazer DSP and, as Cat Admiral says, GET BACK MEOWT THERE!"

I nearly despise the powerup mechanic. Basically you collect power up points and it fills up a meter, so theoretically the higher the meter = the more leveled up your weapon. However, every time you fire it uses up what you've collected, and it's used up so damn fast you end up wasting all that power you've collected on a few jobbers. Now, if the upgrades were permanent, OR you could at least have a dedicated button to choose when you use your leveled up power, then the game would be a little better.Overall, I played 1.4 hours and for the last .4 I was already bored. Just my own honest opinion."
,Not Recommended,462100,33495910,Posted: 12 July,all,±πgv± totes not Reso,"NOTE: Steam review system is dumb. I wish I could take a neutral stance rather than having to go with WHOLLY RECOMMEND or WHOLLY NOT RECOMMEND, but I chose to not recommend the game for reasons stated below. However, this review is more positive of the game than negative.NOTE2: I'm a derp that doesn't know how to look for more megative reviews on Steam.I typically don't buy side-scrolling shmups, or shmups in general for that matter. I have several reasons for this, three major ones.First of all, I've already spent years of my life playing Touhou and Mushihimesama, enough that I feel like another shmup just won't give me the same amount of satisfaction.Second, this is a side-scroller, and having played a lot of Touhou, side-scrolling just felt very... awkward to play.And the third is that this is a shmup. You play one or two or ten, and you've played them all. I wasn't going to put down money for a shmup that probably have mechanics that aren't new nor fresh. It had to be for a good reason.And then that reason appeared. Its name is Alexander Thomas Mauer. You guys already know what's happened, so let's keep it short. Found out about the 'situation'. Decided to take a side by choosing to buy this game (and planning on buying more copies of it to give to friends and family) as soon as it reappeared on the Steam Store.And what did I get from buying this game? Unfortunately, a pretty generic shmup, in my opinion. There's nothing specific in this game that's bad. And I guess you can say that's a good thing. It's just unfortunate that the shmup genre is one that's really hard to innovate. There's a set formula to this genre and it's hard to make better.There's very little good I can say about this game. It's challenging enough, though probably higher than expected for newer players of the genre. It's visually pleasing. The little bits of voice acting from the pilots are hit-or-miss for, more on the miss side though I guess I can just turn them off. I can't really say anything about the music, because this isn't the original music. While I can say that the current music fits the theming of the game, I can't really call it excellent. And I can't really compare it Alexander's original music either.The one thing this shmup has going for it is its drafting system. Long story short, every round you use the points collected to in that round to draft a set of pilots for the next round. If anyone here plays Magic The Gathering (not the online version, like the actual cards and booster packs you OUTSIDE to play with other people), this system reminds me a lot of the Booster Draft mode of play, where people don't start with their own decks but rather open up booster packs to form the decks that they will choose to play with. Of course, DSP's drafting system isn't as thought-inducing as MtG's (unless there's that one type of bullet fire that YOU REALLY LIKE AND YOU ONLY WANT TO PLAY USING THAT BULLET TYPE), but this system is really the only thing that separates this game from the other shmups in the market. As with any opening of booster packs, there's a chance of finding a pilot with a new type of bullet fire and acquiring said pilot for the next round will enable the possiblity of using that bullet fire type for any other pilots afterwards (please correct me if I'm wrong). This is enjoyable to me, who has spent a lot of time playing gacha games. Acquiring a rarer character/pilot and being able to employ its nature later is a rush of dopamine to my system. But even with how much I enjoyed the drafting system, this is still a generic shmup.Regardless of its misfortunes of being a shmup, I still had fun with it. A game doesn't have to be excellent, primo material for someone to be able to have fun with it. I will be returning to this game when I have more free time. Unfortunately, this game just doesn't do enough as a shmup that I can really recommend to anybody personally. While I will recommend to people that I gift the game to play the game, I most certainly can't recommend to those same people to buy it if I wasn't gifting the game to them. Sorry Imagos Softworks.tl;dr I don't buy shmups because I've already played a ♥♥♥♥ton of them, but I bought this one because I wanted to show support for the developers during this Alexander Thomas Mauer debacle. As expected, this game is pretty, but gameplay is generic. It's a side-scrolling shmup. What more are you asking for? The game employs a round-by-round pilot drafting system which really feels like the only thing that separates this shmup from other shmups. I still had fun with it. But the game doesn't do enough as a new entry in the side-scrolling shmup genre, or at least not enough for me to recommend people actually buy this game.NOTE3: I get that this is Early Access. I would like to reiterate that this is still a side-scrolling shmup. I feel like innovation is pretty hard to come by in any form of shmup because a lot has been attempted. I mean, look at some of Kenta Cho's works (that should still be online) as an example. A lot of things have been attempted with the shmup genre, and thus I'm not expecting Imagos Softworks to be able to whip up something great enough for me to change my mind of not recommending anyone buy it."

The voice acting is legitimately funny: I especially like the Jersey girl pilot and the dudebro variant. As it stands right now, the game is a touch short: I beat the first act in just under 2 hours. It's still early access of the time of this review, so I'm sure they're adding more, and there's a whole second act to explore which I'm currently working on. If this game reflects the quality of the hybrid shmup/adventure game that the devs are working on, I'm stoked. Keep up the excellent work, Imagos!"

And I was right. But what I wasn't expecting was that I would become obsessed with this game!! It amazing! It's challenging! It's just great. For the price of a couple hamburgers you get hours and hours of fun!! Highly recommmend

It's a good thing, and I like the style of the graphics with bright pixel blues and purples.  Also reminds me of my favorite game like this that I last played a lot of Contra: Shattered Soldier with the 1 hit deaths and memorization of enemy patterns that I love in these types of games."

ROCKS.I think I've only ever written one other review, and it too was for a little-known indie awesomethon (it's called The Deadly Tower of Monsters, and I seriously mean it when i say that it is one of the best times you'll ever have playing a video game. It's hilarious B-movie action in videogame form, complete with pompous directors, diva actors, an insane sci-fi plot, and poorly made props hanging on strings. But anyway...).I originally bought this game just to support the developers in their fight against a maniac trying to extort them, but I have been  pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful, finely tuned shmup with rogue elements, as well as gorgeous environments/art. Everything else is killer too, from the choice of pilots/weapons/ships, to building your own fleet of pilots based on how well you did the last run. It's not just a shmup -- that's just the gameplay. You're also forced to make decisions like build a fleet with fewer pilots that have better ships and weapons, or more pilots (meaning more lives) with worse attributes.It's tons of fun and a phenomenal revival of the genre! I've been waiting for the old-school shmup genre to get a modern facelift, and this is definitely it!  Thanks, Imagos!"

The bonus to this shooter is the card system which allows you to buy a roster of pilots of whom have their own sets of abilities and 'personality'.  Instead of losing lives you lose the pilots you hired for each mission which adds a fresh twist to the game's genre.  The only  problem I have with the system is that I wish the game would save your money for subsequent playthroughs so you could have some feeling of progress especially since it wouldn't detract from the games difficulty.The music and the voices of each pilot mesh well with the games atmosphere and don't get to the point of repitition nausea even after repeating the same level over and over.  As an 'in-progress' game it's a must buy for anyone who likes 2D side scrolling shooters.

Great soundtrack; nice graphics; slick, simple gameplay with a neat take on the rogue-like genre. It's a fantastic, addictive little shmup that doesn't really go into bullet-hell territory and, in my opinion, is a better game for it.At time of this writing, only Act 1 is complete, and that can be done in a 15 minute run or so. Then the credits roll. Devs have a sketeon of Act 2 available, but it isn't what I would consider up to snuff just yet.Hopefully we see more action out of the Starr Mazer universe, which I was first introduced to in Don Thacker's film Motivational Growth (which is also very good). If you're lucky, you might find Mr. Thacker as one of your pilots..."
