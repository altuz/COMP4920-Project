,Not Recommended,462200,29487146,Posted: 25 January,all,KrudlerTheHorse,"How is this game out of Early Access?  It's little more than a gameplay proof-of-concept at this point.  A very promising one, yes, but this is nowhere near ready for the public IMO.The game needs tons of polish starting with fixing the fact that there is no preview of ""next block"", you can't tell where the heck your existing blocks are going to drop, and the camera keeps floating around when you are trying to line up your drop meaning a great deal of the time your blocks don't go where you intend.The control scheme is perfunctory at best and ill-suited for the type of game.  It uses the mouse to direct the pan of the ""camera"" and align the blocks, but it really should be a left/right control scheme that moves the block one unit at a time.The missions are poorly conceived and badly executed as well.  Within a very short time of starting you'll get to the area where you have to kill 15 Elite foes.  Problem is the RNG takes literally an hour to spawn that many Elites.  None of the stuff like this is fleshed out at all.  One time I played for over 40 minutes before I gave up after finding and killing only 2 Elites.Just take a long, wide, deep pass on this game until the devs make this into a real game and not a proof-of-concept."

Could anyone imagine what a great mix of tetris and roguelike could there be?The game advantages are:+ Unique cross-genre mechanics: you build your own dungeon to explore;+ The game is well-balanced: you aren't gonna be a punching bag there, though you won't be able to perpetrate a massacre. Sometimes you'll have to use your brain in order not to get yourself cornered;+ Replayability: cartoonish graphics may make you think the game is casual and light, but it's extremely addicting. You can follow the storyline or beat the records in the endless mode, still every run will be unique! Something new appears all the time! I've played about 10 hours already and guess, that the real kicker is ahead.I can't but mention a couple of disadvantages, which are the only music track (I'd like more) and some bugs, that are certainly going to be fixed in the final release version.The price for this masterpiece is low indeed, so shut up and take my money!Игра просто супер! Кто бы мог подумать, что рогалик можно так занятно смешать с тетрисом!Достоинства игры:+ Уникальная механика на стыке жанров: вы сами строите себе подземелье, по которому потом ходите;+ Хороший баланс: вас не будут откровенно нагибать, но и спинномозговую резню устроить не удастся - кое-где надо будет подумать, чтобы не загнать себя в угол;+ Реиграбельность: несмотря на кажушуюся из-за мультяшной графики простоту игры, она затягивает надолго. Можно идти по сюжету, можно покорять таблицу рекордов в бесконечном режиме, но каждый забег будет уникальным, и всё время появляется что-то новое! Я наиграл уже часов 10, но подозреваю, что самое интересное ещё впереди.Из недостатков можно отметить малое количество музыкальных треков и некоторые баги, которые к релизу, думаю, устранят.Цена за это великолепие просто смешная, так что shut up and take my money!"

Honestly, the dungeon building aspect really doesn't matter. You just keep building up, and thowing blocks you can't use to one side or the other. The game is a bit of a slog... still,..That all said, I cannot subject any friend to this game."
,Recommended,462200,25760016,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Misery,"So, once again writing a review here.  This is sort of another ""first impressions"" review.  I only write one of these when I find a game where I can see the potential of it right away, and where I'm already impressed by it and have an idea as to where the gameplay is going to lead me.  This is one of those games.However, first impressions can be a little weird with this one.  A couple of things I ran into are things that might put some players off from playing this any further... yet they arent ACTUALLY problems.  But they might really seem like it when you first see them, due to how incredibly different this game is.Dungetris is a fairly typical roguelike in terms of it's high emphasis on RNG, brutal difficulty, and simple-yet-strategic combat mechanics.  Where this game strays from the norm is it's fantastic ""dungeon tetris"" mechanic.  At any time, you can hold the right mouse button down to bring up the next dungeon piece; you can see it exactly as it will be, and also see exactly what's in it, before you place it.  These pieces cannot be rotated, and will drop straight down when you click, landing on the first thing they hit, which means you cant do things like place a new piece UNDER an old one.  These pieces can have all sorts of things in them.  Monsters, treasure chests, shops, crates, shrines... all sorts of things.  And of course each also has walls in all sorts of configuration.  And they're different sizes too; sometimes you'll get a piece that's just a single block in size... by far the easiest type to place... but other times you might get one that's three blocks in a horizontal line... not so easy to place.In effect, this gives the RNG of dungeon layout as in other roguelikes, but here, you control where the RNG goes.  There's ALOT of strategy here.  Monster types, for example, are all different in behavior and tendancies.  I learned really fast that the big rat guys are stupidly powerful... at least early on, I sure dont want those jerks running around. 500 HP with 8 attack power?  When I've got 15 HP and a toothpick?  Yeah.  Too strong!  But the RNG cant just shove them at me by itself... I get to place the piece wherever I want, and it DOESNT have to connect to another piece (meaning I can drop it on the ground a few blocks from the current boundary of my dungeon). Further strategic piece placement can ""connect"" that horrible rat-piece to my dungeon, yet with walls completely locking him in there, so I can continue building around him without having to deal with him.  But of course, it's just as easy to wall off treasure or whatever, or just make it so that it's going to take a good while to get at that treasure chest you just placed.  You cant skip or choose your pieces, so you *must* place whatever it gives you next, but the great part is you can do this at absolutly any time, and it doesnt use up your turn.  If I want to place 10 dungeon bits before my next turn, I can do that.  This may sound like it could make for OP situations, but.... no.  It's dangerous if you go too far at once, because one way or another, you're going to have to deal with monster pieces, and you cant just keep blocking them off as it'll restrict you way too much.Really, there's so very much strategic potential just in that mechanic of this game.  Just have a look at the screenshots on the store page to see some examples.  Lots of strategic potential indeed, and the sort that'll have you making very difficult decisions much of the time (which is a good thing).  You'll have plenty of moments where you suddenly realize that you made a seriously stupid move, and it's absolutely your own fault... the RNG didnt FORCE you to put that specific piece there that's screwing you over.  You had other options with it.  You just didnt do those things.  This is much, much less frustrating than some roguelikes where it's like ""Here's this potion.  You dont know what it does.  OOPS you're on fire now and there's laser bees everywhere, sorry, you're dead"".   None of that.  But you have to think about your placements, and plan ahead.The game also uses a funky card system instead of normal items.  You hold cards that you can play at any time, which do all sorts of things.  Many of these things are temporary; some stick around but may break.  But none of them do a thing until you play the card, and of course, you cant just hold a kersquillion cards at once.  You're not always going to HAVE cards with you... you dont just draw these from a deck.  You have to find them, which is done in a variety of ways (or buy them).  The system takes a bit of getting used to, but in the end, just adds to the strategy of the game further.One issue though is that the game might seem unbalanced as all heck when you start.  For example, you see those rat guys, or a particularly strong slime, and go ""How in the world am I supposed to deal with that?  That's impossible to beat!  What could I possibly do? It's so broken!"" due to old habits gained from other roguelikes.  This game really forces you to put aside your old habits and think differently, as solutions to problems are often very different here.  It's all in the pieces and the cards, and what you do with them, and it's so very different from other roguelikes that it can be hard to wrap your mind around.The only problem I've run into is that some things can be pretty darned unclear as to just what they do... the game doesnt explain itself all that well.  So that can be an issue for some players.Other than that though... like I said, this is pretty great already, and has the potential to be amazing as time goes on.  I definitely recommend it, and I cant wait to see where they take it from here."

It's easy to play, it requires some thought in tile placement and what you can take on with your character.  I like the card system for items and abilities.This is a great game, and if the controls were tightened up just a bit, it would be fantastic."
,Not Recommended,462200,29890290,Posted: 12 February,all,JONtheBOMB,"Click here for video reviewWhat I like about this game:The strategic element of placing new dungeon pieces is really fun.  When you hold the right mouse button, you can see the entire map tile that will drop into the world (any enemies, powerups, etc. on the tile are visible, too).  The game will challenge you to place pieces in such a way to gain access to the powerups and avoid enemies you don’t want to fight.The Spell Card system is really interesting.  Cards like Teleport really expand how you can approach the map building and/or get you out of a tough spot.The user interface is very well done.  Cards, powerups, heroe health, enemy health, etc. are all very visible and if you know the mechanics you should have all the information you need when you plan out moves.Leveling up your characters and spells is satisfying and keeps you pretty well interesting in playing for a little longer than you might otherwise want to.  You can grind a little bit if you want.What I don’t like about this game:The graphics in the world selection screen are really lacking.  There is one (1) tile texture for grass and two (2) for roads.  The only variation is the color of the grass, which indicates which “level” of the game you are in.  Changing the orientation of the same tiles may have gone a long way to make the screen look a lot more appealing.You cannot rotate the new dungeon pieces as you build up the level.  This limits the options and strategies when placing tiles, which is a big let down because sometimes the game will throw the perfect piece at you, but it's rotated 90 degrees in the wrong direction and you will have to screw yourself over by placing the tile in a less than ideal spot.Together with the second bullet above, with less options to optimize your dungeon building, most games devolve into a total mess by the end of the game.  As a result levels take way longer to complete (up to 40 minutes) than I think should be necessary.  Max level time should be in the 20 minute range in my opinion.  After that it starts to feel like a chore to finish a level.After you beat or lose a level, you can’t look at the huge dungeon that you just built.  It would have been fun to look back and see how wild and crazy the castle ended up looking after a session.  I would love to share a screenshot of the wildest ones I’ve created if I could see the whole thing in one screen.There isn’t much of a story with this game.  There are some narrative things that happen; like at one point you have to save a blacksmith from a dungeon and then he opens his shop to you.  This isn’t enough to drive you to finish the game and grind through all the levels.Conclusions:I have mixed feelings about this game.  I love how smooth the tetris and dungeon crawler mechanics blend together seamlessly here.  But, the lack of any story, the bland graphics, long and sometimes frustrating levels really fight against this game.  It's a game that's fun to play for a couple of hours, but there really isn’t much to motivate me to play for longer.  For $4.99 I think this game could have been slightly better and at this price point I would not recommend this title.  For $1.99 I think this is a good purchase.  Addressing the issues with the game and adding a story (even a simple one) would go a long way to bump this game back to the $5 range for me."

Did I have fun playing the game?  Yes.  Would I recommend it?  Alas, no.Some of the levels are ridiculously hard (the kill 25 Elite enemies missions) even with a high level character.  Even with that, the game is INCREDIBLY SHORT.The card library is incredibly small and most the cards you get are next to useless later in the game.  Gold Fever is the main offender, you need gold to buy things and open certain doors, but once you start getting gold in the dungeon it becomes absolutely useless and downright detremental.  Glitter Dust is the next big offender, if you don't have a weapon card to use it on at the start of the dungeon, chances are extremely slim that you will be able to use the card.  One level, I had nothing but Glitter Dust cards in my hand, mocking me, with no weapon to use it on.  Luckily, the Barter card came up and fixed that somewhat.Powerups to the cards are also limited.  Once you have the all cards, which numbers less than a standard playing card deck, material boosts are easy to come by and you'll have ALL the cards powered up well before the end of the game.The placement tool could also use a bit of work, it's a bit skittish and I can't tell you how many times I misplaced a block because of it.  The camera controls are wonky as well.I put in extra money to get the soundtrack and even that proved to be a mistake, it's repetitive and forgettable.Last word?  It wasn't worth the $4 I plunked down for 12 1/2 hours of gameplay.  If the developers actually flesh this game out more, it will be enjoyable.  But until they add additional content, give the game a wide berth."
,Recommended,462200,25746071,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,DrSadistic,"Okay, Dungetris... where to begin. The graphics are simple and well drawn and work surprisingly well with this type of game. The combination of building the dungeon as you progress through each level makes it both unique and challenging and the card system works pretty well. The music is repetitive, but not hard to listen to. I would assuming at the 30 to 40 hour mark, I'm sure I'd choose something new to listen to.A few things that are odd to me, however. First, you can collect coins, which I would assume you can use to purchase in-game items, but I couldn't find a place to use them after the first 3 levels... an item shop can usually be found at the main menu. Also, progess in each level in individual of other levels and resets at death. Say you reach level 2 in a level and die, you start back at level 1. This adds to the challenge, but can be very frustrating as the monsters are EXTREMELY overpowered at this point in the game.I will update this review as time goes on, but this is certainly a solid purchase at $2.99 or $2.59... be warned about the overpowered monsters, however and please don't rage on your keyboard!The Doctor's Final Report: 7/10; This one has HUGE potential as long as the developer keeps the content coming!"
,Recommended,462200,31954520,Posted: 25 May,all,holdmykidney,"Great fun little game. Probably takes a while for the challenge to kick in, which is perhaps why there is a danger of it feeling repetitive quickly, could perhaps do with a steeper difficulty option.However the core loop of placing rooms and carefully managing enemy encounters against limited resources is excellently played. Great variation in enemy types combine with the ever-changing architecture to keep the challenge fresh. And choosing to strategically place certain rooms to try to open up otherwise innaccessible paths is always rewarding.Some objectives work better than others, for example ""Place 200 rooms"" is best overcome simply by dropping as many rooms as possible in a big pile at the extent of your mouse range. Similarly, finding the boss room is often a patience-testing sort through the room deck. But overall there are a great selection of levels and objectives.I managed to complete the game and 100% the cheevos in about 7.5 hours, so it's not long in terms of challenge or content, but the core gameplay is fun enough to warrant a return to play. And for such a low price, the quality of this game punches well above its weight."

,Recommended,462200,26446179,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,TigerTrix,"Great concept, executed fairly well (in early access).  The controls are a little wonky, but with an xbox360 gamepad & Controller Companion and a few tweaks (left-stick = WSAD, right-stick = mouse, RT = right-mouse, X=space, RB=c) I was able to play reasonably well and had fun.  The dev said in discussions he plans full controller support, but it is more than serviceable for now (with Controller Companion anyway).The game itself is quite fun.  Create the dungeon as you go, fight enemies (just click on them when next to them), and die if your health runs out.  But you keep a lot of power ups between deaths & levels, so you don't lose everything to start over from scratch.This is a game that lives up to expectations somewhat, and with better controls will probably get a lot better. (3/5 stars as-is at first, 4/5 stars if forgiving controls in early access).UPDATE: Now I am used to playing with the gamepad (mapped via Controller Companion), and I really love the game.  I like that it isn't overly difficult, and you can take your time, and it matters how you build the dungeon and when to trigger enemies.  I keep looking forward to playing again :)."

Not as easy as it sounds.... I die a lot LOL. Really, it comes down to strategizing a bit to ensure you survive. For instance, spawn too many monsters, and you're in trouble. Gotta find that health pickup!But the game isn't finished... and I want you to consider that strongly before you purchase.Limited content: there's only 3 Acts, which once finished leave you craving more.... but it isn't there. There's promise of an endless mode, and two new characters.... but they're not here yet.I'd like to point out that there's achievements in the game that are not accomplishable at all, such as the endless mode achievement.Would I recommend this game? Well, yes, and no...The game is awesome, and has a lot of potential... its worth it when its cheap... but, you may wish to wait until these features are added before you purchase.

This means that is entirely possible to build yourself into a corner -- I've done it more times than I'd like to admit.There isn't an 'undo' last step button, but you can hit the 'esc', then exit. This exits to the map, so you can start that entire build over again.I'm a huge rogue-like fan, and this one definitely is a must-have for my collection. Mechanics seem clean, mouse and keyboard responses are precise and quick."

It's a fun way to spend short amounts of time. The price is perfectly reasonable under $3.However, there is no way to keep your levels as you progress, leveling can be difficult, and enemies are rediculously OP. You can get difficult enimes or not so difficult enimies at any time with any block. This is the most frustrating and irritating part of the game. especially once you pass the blacksmith and have to defeat a boss. (Like, 3 levels into the first map hard) There's no way, even with leveling and using cards. (I'd have to farm for a long time to upgrade cards and even then, you have to get cards by chance.)Despite all that I would recommend a play. It's a neat, different take on dungeon crawling. Hopefully the devs will do something about the whole OP enemies thing."

Making it less fun and enoyable. There isn't that much of a positive. When the rogue-like elements go in your favor either. All it boils down to is. You get to progress.The lack of a block placement preview. Is also a major oversight in game design. It would have made it more enoyable  and less frustrating to play. You can teleport at the cost of hp. However you always use this because you made a mistake. Not because you wanted to use it.To me the rogue-like elements. Do more harm then good to the overall game. It takes more away then it adds to the game.

Organising the dungeon is fun and helps to go through the difficulties that arises (low on energy, lots of monsters, no spells). It's interesting how this mechanic clicks after a while: there's no need to use all the blocks or kill all the monsters.+The shopkeeper can be killed, that amused me quite a lot.+ 12h of gameplayCONS:- No story- Major Tetris mechanic annoyance: the major one is that when the mouse cursor is between two columns, the simple pressing of the mouse button will move slitghly the cursor to one direction, and the block will fall in the wrong column. A bit of ""hysteresis"" could be implemented.- Minor Tetris mechanic annoyance: sometimes the blocks come down with walls all over the perimeters.- I always ended up buying the block spell at the shops in order to pass the level. Entering and exiting the shop will bring different magic spells all the time. Cycling in this way is a bit cheap, but does the job.- Some spells are almost useless, especially the one that gives you money for life points, which are always scarse- Halfway through the game I ended up having all the spells upgraded to the max, so the Material drops became a nuisance.All in all, a good original game."

If you choose to watch the video for my thoughts, please be warned that there are vulgarities used throughout the video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNseU_rax3UHave you ever been playing Tetris and thought it was missing something? Maybe swords and monsters? EfimovMax apparently thought so and made an absolutely AMAZING game with that thought. Dungetris is great fun. In the first 15 minutes I thought I was going to hate this game, I felt like I was making no progress and that the game was so unbalanced that I’d never beat the first few levels.Let me tell you now, I was wrong. This game is difficult for a reason, it requires thought, and good planning to beat the levels. While editing the video, and writing this review I continuously find myself wanting to just go play the game rather than finishing my review. I cannot praise this game enough, EfimovMax did an amazing job of making a game with such a unique idea. I would say that this game is worth $15, definitely grab it for its actual price of only $4.99. Once you get the concept down you will enjoy this game, guaranteed."

However, the difficulty of the enemies is insanely high. I was stuck on level 2 for a half hour, dying in a mere second when hit, wondering if I was doing something wrong with combat. Once you manage to level up a few times, it becomes much easier, but the difficulty needs to be lowered a bit, at least for the first couple of levels."
,Recommended,462200,29290962,Posted: 15 January,all,fuuma,"Never before did I write a recommendation about a game, but the time has come, it seems.The little masterpiece of gamedev that is DUNGETRIS is deserving of every bit of praise you can come with.The idea is new, intriguing, brilliant even: everyone knows that the process of playing a rogue-like game is partly based on more or less explicit masochistic streak on the part of the player. After all, there is some self-deprecating pleasure in knowing that you COULD get around this monster or finish that one if you just thought well enough. ""Losing is fun"", or so they say.And what better way is to take this specific fun of hindsight realizations of your own inadequacy, if not to allow the player to TAKE PART in the ""random level generation""? So he may feel even more guilty feeling self-blame - not only ""If I fought smart"", but ""If only I built this right!"" =)Anyway you can't get even truly angry at losing (which there will be a lot of) in this game. It compels you to try again and again, its gameplay a perfect balance of easyness to reach the heights and - equal easiness to lose it all on that damn elite spider.Although this emotional side matters not as much to me as the genius of the idea itself - to join logical, ""thinking"" games like Tetris with the sheer fun of casual little RPG. It is pleasant to gain EXP and crush monsters; but it can be no less rewarding to solve a puzzle of kinds and pat yourself on the back for that.As for design of the game - well, though it is subjective, I still would rate it superb. Cute cartooney-style characters, adequate sound effects, nice looming threatening music that forces you to remain on its toes...What is not to love here?This is the first game in the long time that made me totally love it. Wish the developers to continue making such a great stuff, and congratulate them on creating something of a classic already.I rate this game ten annoying non-fitting puzzle blocks out of ten =)"

But at the same time, it feels lacking. Like music, for one. I'm pretty sure there's supposed to be some, seeing as there's a volume setting for it, and people in the comments have talked about it...so why I don't have it, I'm unsure.I also feel like there should be some guidelines for controls, or at the very least, settings. I've noticed that the controller port is broken. I can access the map through the controller, but I can't move on after that.It took me a while to figure out that the WASD keys were involved and that I had to press space to even access the levels.I also, personally, think that the rooms should be rotateable. But at the same time, I understand completely why they aren't. It definitely adds more to the challenge.Monsters, especially spiders, seem to destroy the ever-loving crap out of me and there's not really anything I can do about it. But that could just be my personal vendetta against spiders that are as big as me.All in all, like I said. I REALLY want to like this game. It's got a lot of great potential, but some things are missing and it kinda puts a damper on the experience."

It was fun, the gameplay was tight, and the premise turned a basic Roguelike into something a little more original. However, the Hallowe'en update greatly increased the mouselook sensitivity of the game to the point of nausea.For the present, I'm going to treat this as an evolving review and I encourage others to do the same.The developers have addressed the issue, but the game is still basically unplayable at this time. The mouselook is still wrenching to try to keep track of and the increased mouselook speed has rendered the game frustrating to play while I battle the controls for basic actions.To the developers: Guys, you had it right the first time. Put it back or put the old speed as selectable in the options and I'm willing to recommend the game again. Until you do that, I can't recommend the game at all and would never have done so in the first place.I put in hours upon hours in your original build. I can barely touch the game as it stands now.

It cost almost nothing and it's fun enough to play for a few hours so if it looks even remotely interesting I would say give it a go.Being an early build I am mostly grading this on potential and the fun factor of the core mechanic which I found to be enjoyable. The core mechanic would be a merging of a tactical rougelike and a dungeon building puzzle game. If you've played Guild of Dungeonering it's the same gimmick done a little differently (and hopefully it will be a better end product). What's here is good...but unpolished and extremely content light....(so not really following the rules of EA as I understand them....but then again who does?) there is potential for alot more and I hope this solid foundation will be expanded on. Would love to see this turn into the next Desktop Dungeons.FULL WARNINGForgivable b/c EA but in the current state there are some negatives.....UnbalancedVery Basic Combat

If this game is that rougish, fine, I can deal with that, but it really does seem as if you should be able to keep xp and whatever level you're on.Also doesn't seem as if any stat boosts one finds in-game carries over, which is disappointing.It is kinda fun, but frustrating; I was also expecting the mechanics of the game to be different.

Spell cards come in handy when you think they may just be a gimmie, and I personally always enjoy a game with a good dose of RNG.Originally I thought this was going to be a game I'd open once or twice and play for about thrity minutes, but it turned out to be a lot better than something that would sit in my library.
