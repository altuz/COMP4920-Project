""Please, only use the red grips if you want a challenge"".Sure thing, I get that. But isn't that more of a achivement, and not so much of a difficulty implementation?1 level.It took me ~2 minutes to complete. That was the entire game.Think of this as level 1 of Super Mario. With only 1 type of enemy. For 20€."

I wish it were a bit more forgiving, but I really feel like I could get amazing at this game, after a while. I love the super bright colors of the world, and the fact that I can choose to party or execute my losing competitors at the end of the game. Super fun touches like that are what make the game fun to play.Because it is based on such a solid mechanic, I'm sure this is a game that will keep getting better and better, as time goes on. 100% recommended to buy."

I don't get as scared in The Climb because I'm always looking up at the next place to grab and I'm also constantly looking at a wall. In this game you always see what's below you and let me tell you it's very scary when you're up high!

There are a healthy amount of levels now, and the art design and use of color are very appealing. Using your hands to move is my favorite locomotion scheme in VR at the moment, and it works well here in one of the first experiences to use that method. Flinging yourself through the levels is a lot of fun. If you already have Climbey or are not turned on by it's drab aesthetic, this is a good alternative."

Climbing the courses with friends is great and can be a challenge. The best part of the game was being able to launch yourself from the the colorful gumdrops and choclatebars. Sweet Escape VR also isn't afraid of heights, falling couldn't be more terrifying."

I haven't played multiplayer yet but I imagine it's even better than single player."

,Recommended,462480,28547829,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,123,"The novelty of the type of movement in this game cannot be overstated - it was the #1 reason that I decided to purchase this game, and it was everything that I expected.Throwing yourself from one candy to another is immensely satisfying -- and so is crawling from candy to candy. With the latest update, they've also added much longer courses, which make finishing the levels much more satisfying.Of course, the game is in early access, so there's a long ways to go - but I think Monster VR is on to something here, and I can't wait to see this game improve further. For the early access price tag, you absolutely cannot go wrong.[edit] I forgot to mention that the initial feeling of flying through the air like this can be disconcerting - I'm not prone to motion sickness, and this game didn't make me sick, but because of the way the movement is in this game, be prepared for a thrill - it's pretty awesome."

,Recommended,462480,29024879,Posted: 4 January,all,SaveThePonies,"The climbing mechanic is incredibly well done. Once I got in the home, I soon found myself purely swinging from object to object, trying to impress my friends with death defying stunts. It brings back the sense of KZ climbers from counter-strike. I thoroughly enjoyed the feel of propelling myself forward and can't wait to see if they can make some truly challenging puzzles."

The game mechanics feel wonderful and the artstyle is bright and colorful. Intrested to see more from this Dev and see what they do with this game. The multiplayer is quite underpopulated though, which is the only downside. If more people heard of this im sure the multiplayer would be amazing."

The game is very easy to master, very well designed and very fun to play. Only things that could make it better would maybe be some hazards other than falling to your death. Either way, for the price, this is a solid game. Looking forward to seeing what else these developers come up with."

The controls are extremely easy to master (trigger to grab, release and swing to jump) which is great for beginners to Virtual Reality.  My nephew and I both got on the other day and raced through the levels in multiplayer.  I can't wait to challenge more friends to a battle to the top.Adding more levels, environment and hazards would add to the experience, but a great introduction from the team at Monster VR."

I just hope there are coming more levels and a bit more difficult, maybe with some floor.. making some level design more.. designed. But it just give a great experience. Lots of emotions there!It maybe does not look like some game you would buy because of the theme, but.. it does worth it."

As much as I enjoy games like John Wick and Brookhaven,  this is a fun change of pace. I have had this game for about a month and already new courses have been added.  So much fun for so little money."
,Recommended,462480,22545003,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,shelleproductions,"As an early access title, I can absolutely forgive Sweet Escape VR for being incomplete.  I'm putting faith that an even better and more complete title is on its way in the future.As it stands, the current game is a single race along rock walls made of HTC branded chocolate bars, gum drops, candy canes and gummy bears.  There's multiplayer connectivity available if you have two Vives or connect via matchmaking features that likely won't turn up many other players until people both have VR headsets and buy the game.  I demoed an earlier build last month at a convention and the competiveness of a two player race is excellent.There's a bit of a challenge with multiple paths along the way to the finish line, with the green gumdrops being an easy path and the yellow gumdrops providing more of a challenge, but overall, there's currently not more than 10 minutes or so of single player content if you aren't racing friends or internet strangers.What exists today is an extremely fun concept and it actually feels like I'm stretching to grab the next hold on a rock wall each time I extend my arm and controller.  I think it is a good gamble to take at the highly reduced price for early access for a game very early in development.  Now I just need more people to buy it so that I have an excuse to practice and race you!"

76561198347966442,Recommended,462480,29507210,Posted: 26 January,all,aharshvive,"So far this is my second favorite vive game. The candy and graphics lured me in, I felt safe, then I tried throwing myself like they showed, missed my grab, fell off a candy cane, and every muscle in my body screamed as I fell. It's a brightly colored fun game that is great to introduce people to just how real vr can feel. It's really fun to throw yourself up the course soaring through the air and even after a couple hours of playing I still feel a twinge when I miss that grab and fall. I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I'm looking forward to it. My wife was pretty meh on vr besides google earth, but she ended up loving this. It's been a good gateway game to get her into some vr gaming. Great game that's totally worth the price."
