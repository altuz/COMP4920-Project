It does not matter if you start the city the same way all the time, the game guides you (thru several events) to a path where you have to abandon your strategy and focus on the problems, trying to get everything working even when you can clearly see the end.The best part is when you think  everything is going to be ok, your citizens loves you, the city is growing up and suddenly ... Godzilla!!A match of 10-15 minutes are good enough to enjoy the game and try new things. Super recommended!"

,Recommended,462680,25960914,"Posted: 9 October, 2016",all,Nenitosoyyo,"Game is pretty entertaining and can occupy with silly fun for hours, its also very challenging when trying to build your metropoilis up in the sky and when you have to take care of your citizens from fires, robbers, monsters, and etc. It might look easy to balance out, but believe with so much trial error you learn for future cities on what to do and not to do. If you need something to occupy your mind or kill some time, I would highly reccommend the game, worth the money, and hope the dev adds more features and buildings into the game. I'd love to see a auto save feature because I have exited out of my cities by accident and lose the work I was on, but other than that game is pretty sweet!"
,Recommended,462680,25437182,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,BlackParadise,"I recently bought this game and play for a while. I found out that this game still got something that can be improve and some minor problem or maybe bug. first of all, i feel like the game should be forgiving . Example sometime when i use demolish , i will accidentally press on something i dont want to delete and this cause me problem, i hope that the game can inplement some undo feature. Even if undo feature cannot be implement atleast implement something like hold z-key and click to delete to better prevent accidental demolish. The second issue is that the police helicopter often cant work properly. For instance, when i press on the riot people the copter will just fly nearby the rioting people and do nothing. I also hope that those 3 helicopter got some queue action feature like when i press on multiple fire source , the firecopter will auto fly to each of the place i click following the sequence.(Btw those copter seems to delay a bit after i clicked). There some minor bug but it still ok. I also wondering if the guider said so: call the police tha handle the riot or full fill thier demand, is there anyway to listen to thier demand?In a nut shell , it is a good game allowing people to kill some time or relax. Not recommend for perfectionist as they will try to arrange all those block perfectly like i do often keep delete and replace those block to look nice and tidy."

You can keep coming back to it over and over. I'm sure I'll get tired of it at some point, but I also know that at some point in the future I would start playing it again. It's got that ""one more time"" kind of quality.Combines creativity with strategy. Challenging but well balanced.In case you didn't get the gist of it yet, I highly recommend this game."

,Recommended,462680,34180536,Posted: 11 August,all,Mickmane,"This game scratches a previously long dormant (even unknown) itch for piling up blocks in hope it stays stable. ... And then laugh out loud when it all topples anyway. (Ok, I'm easily amused. :) )Have not played enough to see how much of strategic building there is, though with disasters and requirements, I can see how the perfect tower can be a challenge for those who want one.For now, for me, the block part is certainly amusing!Butbut, you might say, piling up blocks is for little kids! Yup. And adults who now and then like something relaxing and silly.For currently 79 cent (90% off), can't go wrong if any of the above sounds remotely fun to you. :)Oh, one thing. Music and sound muting is not separate, unfortunately."
,Not Recommended,462680,29271052,Posted: 15 January,all,Treazo,"No options to change sound levels.No option to change the window size etc.The concept is great, but the game is (still?) a bit buggy / feels unfinished and cheap."
,Recommended,462680,28656185,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Wisp,"Great timesink, funny to play a level here and there.Disasters ruin the game, specially meteor strike. You can disable disasters but apparently the game will not obey the settings AFTER you start a game, and since the game doen't save your options and always start with disasters enabled, I have lost so many cities to a meteor because I forgot to disable it that it started to get really boring.9/10 - if you could actually disable disasters in the middle of a game, it could be a 10."

You will find out while playing it that RNG does play a large part in the scenarios, having to do with meteors being a random event that will destroy your city in one shot. You are supposed to be able to counter this by placing missiles to shoot the meteors out of the air, but the problem is still half the time these missiles miss and you lose your whole city. Plus there are a few very strange hitboxes on some of the buildings such as the Oriental Tower on the Shanghai scenario. And finally the balancing problems, there is a mode unlocked after beating a mission titled rich and poor, this mode allows you to place down slum buildings which don't require jobs or electricity. With almost exclusively these buildings it is very easy to beat most of the scenarios rendering most of the strategy elements useless. Even with these problems you should still pick up the game, but if the developer was to read my review the community would still like you to fix these problems."

It offers a unique fusion of genres, and the results are enjoyable as they are refreshing. Reminds me of the gaming classic, World of Goo.The cleverness and variety of the design is impressive. For example, there is a level where gravity is inverted, and you have to build a city capable of surviving gravity reverting. Another has you flying about like superman trying to save metropolis. Berlin has you literally trying to balance the unification of east and west Germany. Every level does something different, and each one is unique and memorable.You can play the game as a precise physics based city planner, or as a light hearted, fly by the seat of your pants builder. The charming novelty of it all had me walking away with a smile on my face, and made me feel like a kid again."

76561198006986577,Recommended,462680,30975554,Posted: 6 April,all,DragonElderX9,"A quirky and unique puzzle game.  It has fantastic music and sounds and a unique concept, but there really isn't much variety.  You build houses, offices, and power plants so that you can go up and create more houses, offices, and power plants.  It does get pretty difficult as well and it really forces you to be creative.  It's a prety fun game in short bursts of play."

It is super fun and I totally recommend it. I think it can provide fun for hours and I just totally love it. But, I do have a few problems. First of all, I don't think it's worth 10 dollars. I got it on the autumn sale and I think $6 is a very reasonable price, or maybe $8 might be more fair. Second, I just think that when you try to demolish windmills, it's very annoying that I have to destroy both parts (the tower and the spinning part). Lastly, which I think is the most annoying part, airports don't work like they do in the video. In the video, the planes go right through the middle of the airport, but in my experience, the planes go either at the top of the airport, or at the bottom, which completely messes up my city's upper level balance. (Yes, I have tried using the control tower, but that just makes the planes crash on the upper buildings)I am totally in love with this game but I think it needs some bug fixes. Overall, I would give this game a 9/10"

Emergency services have to be told where to go by clicking on the emergency, be it fire or someone being robbed for example.Also, when I navigated back from the scenarios to the main menu, the game opened the facebook page of itself and I had to actively get rid of that. To me as a classic PC gamer (and, above all, in a PAID game), that is just not acceptable. Also, the guy giving hints and such was, even in free-play, very annoying.All in all, I cannot recommend BalanCity for now. Later, maybe. We'll see how the development goes forward from here."

However, I can't say it gripped my attention for long, getting old quite quickly, though I can see myself coming back to it later if I ever get bored.I reccomend this game. It provides reasonable entertainment given its relatively low cost."
