76561198006578053,Recommended,462700,24132004,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Chad Kroeger,Another year another cricket captain. While it might look like not much has changed since last year under the surface the new camera and improved odi games make it much more enjoyable. The first class games also seem improved and it is the most addictive cricket captain in recent times.At a resonable price this game goes down as a Chads Choice.
76561198141303160,Not Recommended,462700,31271181,Posted: 21 April,all,jasblackstock,"This is one of those games I find immensely frustrating to play, but also highly addictive. I am a huge cricket fan, and the truth is there is no alternative out there for in-depth, strategy or management games for the sport. If you're a fan and want to give it a spin then go for it, but wait for a sale and get it at a low price, because despite the experience and longevity of the franchise the game is bare-bones.I would love to reach out to the developers and implore them to make changes for the next iteration, as the base game is enjoyable but in drastic need of more creative input! All we've seen in terms of additions in recent years has been the inclusion of new leagues. This is fine, but although diversifying the gameplay, does little to improve the experience.None of these appear hard to implement, as other sport management sims have been doing it for decades, but could we please look to include...1) an actual career mode, where you can change teams, move up the 'ladder' and perhaps take jobs in different countries.2) some kind of basic player 'stats' system, so I can actually tell if my player is talented, notably with youth players, whose potential seems entirely arbitrary.3) the ability to hire coaches, or a far more transparent coaching system that allows you to know how and when your players are improving.These additions really are important for giving a player a sense that they are part of a management structure that is affecting the game world. They appear fairly minor changes that for me would make this game far easier to recommend, and would guarantee repeat custom."

,Not Recommended,462700,32063103,Posted: 30 May,all,geoffrey223,"As expected, CC16 is exactly the same as year before and before that, with nothing but an update to the player database - though even that feels poorly researched. To ask £15-20 for what amounts to a patch to a previous game feels disingenuous to this series' fans. Even months before 2017 is released, the game only reduces to £9.99.As someone who has played since CC05, I have noted with a great deal of disappointment how little these games have moved on from year to year. The developers look to quantity (adding new competitions and teams) rather quality (creating a discreeter game with more longevity), and in doing so ignore much of the feedback from their fans - who offer such in goodwill and hope that the next year will be the year Cricket Captain finally pulls itself together.Each year we are promised a better engine that will offer more realistic scenarios, especially in one day and T20 modes, but this has never really come to fruition. Rather, one day games become steadily harder and more tedious to play and T20 is often unplayable. Instead of a better game we are given ""better"" graphics in highlights - which most people skip - though the differene from edition to edition is so minimal.While we all understand that this game is developed by a small team, Childish Things are wasting a lot of goodwill that their fans are granting them. Rather than taking two years to genuinely overhaul the game and create an enjoyable and diverse experience - which no one would truly complain about - they throw out the same thing over and over, year after year and are verging on taking advantage of their fans.A major problem is the lack of competition. But for Cricket Coach, Cricket Captain hasn't seen any competition for years and as such knows that cricket fans, especially those that wish for a management style game, will have no choice but to buy their products. As such a long time consumer, it is so disappointing to see what could be an excellent and innovative series fall to laziness."

76561198082767152,Recommended,462700,32235592,Posted: 7 June,all,Marc Gravett,"So this popped up yesterday on my Wishlist as a Sale item for £7ish, being a huge Cricket fan as well as Cricket Groundsman I just had to bite the bullet and grab it regardless of the lack of activity and Mixed reviews (most of them said if you already own CC2015 then it's not worth it but if not then try it).It's simple in design, no where near as detailed as the FM series or Motorsport Manager, getting into the first game is quick & easy after a few minutes of Menu Hopping. But what it lacks in prettiness it gives bundles back in Statistics on each and every player (a Cricket fans Dream), there's a ton of leagues to play with and all formats of the game are covered including the chance to Captain/Manage National Teams.The 3D Replays are simple, they look a bit funny and after you've seen one match worth of highlights you've pretty much seen every scripted scene. The Match Days options are great, you can change the aggressiveness of your batsmen, the Line & Length of your Bowlers as well as set any Field you wish (within the Laws of the game).There's Training Options for your players, you can Buy & Release Players at the start of each Season, it's pretty much all the basics of Football Manager without the highly over-detailed additional areas.My favourite area is the 'Pitch Groundsman' where you can determine the style of Wicket to be played on for your next home game...like we do that in the real world...!I've already found some pretty obvious bugs (last update was in January with no sign of the Devs/update since) which are slightly annoying but nothing game breaking as of yet.I'm gonna keep it and see how it goes as it's not that bad it needs a refund, it was only a couple of Pints worth and it's something to while away the hours at work on Match & Rainy Days or when the Wifes watching Celebrity Big Bloody Brother! If you like Cricket get it and give it a go and see for yourself, it's cheap."

Outfielders that don't move thus rendering sweepers pointless.When batting your batsmen will do anything but the task you ask of them....and finally beyond the naked stats, badly researched (at least speaking as a Glamorgan fan). Seemingly batting styles have just been allocated at random."

The series used to offer a wealth of management stats and gameplay longevity. The latest edition of Cricket Captain offers none of this.I was a sucker and paid £19.99 for what appears to be a 'tweaked' edition of Cricket Captain 2013.My advice is stay well clear of this game and not become Childish Thing's next sucker."
76561198004010017,Recommended,462700,24781237,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,m_hallam,"This is a terrific game and great value for money on Steam. The essence of the game is its exceptional match engine which is sophisitcated enough to create a huge variety of results and outcomes. It is especially good at replicating the real life twists and turns of test match or 4 day cricket. If you are a cricket fan there is a huge amount of gameplay on offer here. The non-match management is not quite so good - aspects like training and player regeneration, for example, are a little limiting. But its clear that small improvements are being made with each edition of the game and the maintenance of the player database is very good with regular updates to reflect real-life changes or community input.  The game doesn't have the range of features or aesthetics of well-resourced series like Football Manager but in terms of realistic simulation of the actual sport it does very well for itself."

Player database is not realistic, crap players low end players are world class and good players rarely play well. The scouting system of the developers are very bad. If you need help with the player database ask the users, let them you you accurate stats, the people who actually follo domestic cricket of their country.6.

Very frustrating and annoying. Keep losing on easy no matter what I try. Bowling/batting with different settings doesn't seem to make any difference. I can't tell which players actually are good/bad (as in say FM series), no indication of their abilities. Telling me that some batter is aggressive doesn't help me much, as if after settling in I set him to aggressive (say 4-5), he gets bowled out.Played the 14 version and seems to be the same AI/mechanics. Also commentary is a bit off timed, in a way that commentator speaks before the event and that is annoying too.  With a little improvement could be a classic. Such a shame, can't really recommend even on sale."

76561198033186892,Not Recommended,462700,29708382,Posted: 4 February,all,barto_123,"I will say this upfront: if you are a hardcore Cricket fan, and if you enjoy the statistical side to the game, then you may end up liking this game. There are two core aspects to the game: selection of your team, and then setting fields and managing how aggressive your bowlers and batsmen are during the games themselves. You don’t have any direct control over the players, so in many ways it’s sort of a cricket match simulator. The amount of input you put into the game is quite minimal, so it feels like a casual game with a strong statistical emphasis. The main difficulty with the game is the selection process, as you don’t have access to any attributes, aside from their statistical records in previous matches, which like a real cricket selector means you either have to choose based on gut instinct, or record over a period of time.Whilst this simplistic style of game can be endearing, ultimately it’s hard to recommend at this price, as the game has not fundamentally changed in over 15 years, and the incremental changes are hardly revolutionary. The graphics and UI are awful. The lack of a player editor to fix basic errors in details and ability means that to seasoned cricket fans the database will frustrate, as the game outside of England is not well scouted or balanced and don’t often reflect real world abilities. I understand the decision not to include editor is because the game is so similar to previous editions; fans would be able to update them themselves and wouldn’t spend the money. However, when the database is so fundamentally flawed, I cannot let it slide.If you haven’t played this series before, it’s well worth a look. If you have a recent edition, there’s not enough new content to warrant the asking price."
76561198005559977,Not Recommended,462700,25679755,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,wolfhaines,"What utter tosh. Where to start?Firstly, the game is pretty basic and there isn't a lot to get involved in. It feels like a game where 90% of the content is purely for show and doesn't actually affect anything that goes on. Think of a slot machine with all the fancy lights, yet we all know the result is randomly generated. I don't thtink the coding on this game is realistic or extensive in the slightest.Talking of randomly generated results- several times during first class games I have been bowled out for less than 50 despite needing less than 100 to win. It even happens if I set my players to ultra-defensive and have 2 days in which to get the runs. There is no mid game save feature either, and you cannot exit the game without saving it. So when the game genarates these ridiculous collapses every game you can't even try again.My biggest disappointment is the West Indies. Don't pick them if you want to win a T20 game. The two time T20 world champions are given the batting abilities of a primary school kid facing the onslaught on an ashes bowler. The batting collapses in first class cricket, combined with the impossibility of getting a test nation above 110 runs in T20 all made the game a pile of excrement.Overall I would say this game was a complete waste of money and is so bad it gets boring."
