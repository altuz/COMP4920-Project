I guess there could be a strategy game in here somewhere but even some simple documentation to explain the screen, menus and concepts would be nice. Tired of developers putting out products and telling you to guess how to play, or watch utube videos. Lazy. Refund."

A guide / manual / information would be nice. Any chance?99. .....100. Remind me, someone, how do I refund this?"
,Not Recommended,462830,22702712,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,Chief Adu,"Even though I have played this games for hours now, it's a rather disappointing game:* No manual - no documentation of planes, fuel efficiency, nor route recommendations* Useless tutorial - to be fair, this game has probably the most useless tutorial ever* Broken - I am currently the only airline who is not in debt. All the others are $200,000-$400,000 in debt, yet they are still able to continue to play? What's the point in being profitable? Due to this, the other airlines still dominate certain continents/areas with their hubs (and flying to a competitor's hub costs quite a lot)Overall, this game is plane bad (pun intended). Aa the miserable person I am, I played this game too long to refund it, but please, until this game gets updated (in the good way), spare your pennies, and save it for something more useful, as this game will disappoint you."

There might be a game here, but the tutorial is so poorly implemented that you're left trying to figure out what seems like a fairly complex game with absolutely no guidance.After setting up five routes and less than a couple of minutes, your tutorial friend tells you ""there's nothing left I can teach you"" leaving you to figure out the vast majority of the game play and mechanics by yourself.No exit button, have to back out to Windows and close from there.Poorly thoughout cash grab of a game."

I played it way longer than I should have and i think i actually fell asleep with it running too. Heres a run down probably explaining better why people are hating so much on the game.Summary : Probably best to avoid in its current state unless heavily discounted or in an offsite bundle.+ Concept and game idea+ Plenty of planes+ ...+ Really wish I could put more here.- Tutorial ( non-existant , see below)- Map view shown with city names isn't in the game- 'Competant AI' - Spreads like wildfire , making big profits early game, soon bankrupts self after- ' AI is thinking ... ' even on fast forward, later on can take 30+ seconds / turn to decide- Music loop gets quickly irratating ( same loop in the video )- Only 153 cities? (Advertised 156)- Economy either booms or goes into crisis ( Random event)- Turn based action points ( see below)- Leaderboards? Not implemented , links to achievements- No campaigns, win/lose goals etc- No Detailed information on profit / loss / routes etc ( expanded below)- So many useless plane models- Planes are 'free' no research needed- One type of plane / route ( can only send a max of 3x planes / route)... I wrote some follow up stuff but it didn't seem to post , so i posted in the discussion board instead -http://steamcommunity.com/app/462830/discussions/0/364040166678051154/"

Doesnt matter what grapics card I use doesn't matter whatgraphics settings are used.  Hoping in time I get to change this review to a positive but at thispoint I would not advise purchasing this game.

I dont need any instructions having played this back when it was called ""AeroBiz"" on SNES. Basically this is one of your grandads tycoon games and Ive been wanting a new one to come out for a long time. This isnt even as in depth as the SNES version and I hope they refine this ported update but for %$ or whatever its delivering exactly what it should, no more no less. I reccomend, all things considered and put my vote out there for something like this but even more in-depth, ala a paradox game perhaps.Google : areobiz SNES"" if you cant figure out how to play. Their instrunction manual was about as in depth as this one and I figured out how to play it when I was 9 so....I have faith you can too."
,Recommended,462830,22790139,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,WickedPuppy,"All these negative reviews for a game that costs less then a meal at McDonalds. The game is exactly what one would expect from such a low cost game. It is not one of these cash-grab type of strategy/sim game. In fact with some added and needed tool tips, expanded purchasing options, and a bit more flexibility it could be a really great simulation game.The strategy involved is engaging, but you will have to play at least two times to grasp the concepts. Essentially, you are trying to figure out where to make the most money. When you have a market segment to yourself and no competition, you will do well. However, as the game progresses you begin competing with other companies for passengers along routes other carriers have. You will have to be smart, watch connecting flights, and be sure your planes are giving you a good rating. Additionally, sometimes the biggest planes aren't the best for certain routes. Sometimes multiple small planes will net you a larger sum of cash.There is no tutorial worthy of mentioning. So you will be dropped into a game unsure how its components interact and unsure what the point of it all is. There is however an actual strategy to the game once you discover it."

I like getting into the information and numbers and figuring out how to make things work.  Having played some spread-sheet games in the past with a similar look to Airline Director 2, I thought that was what I was getting.  Not the case.  This is more of a clicker-style game.  Just set up new routes and let them make/lose money.  You don't have much to do beyond that & I quickly lost interest.  That being said,   I do see a nucleus  of possibilities within the game.  I don't recommend it at the moment, but will be keeping an eye on it to see if its potential can be realized."

76561198086116497,Recommended,462830,24850317,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,airborneX0101,"So there were a lot of negative reviews before I got this game, but I remained optimistic and I bought it anyway. The game, in my opinion, is pretty good. For a $5 game, I'm actually impressed. It is a simple strategy/simulation game where you own an airline and you simply create flights between destinations that are in demand and try to make a profit. You choose between a bunch of airplanes to service your routes and you can also choose the quality of your flights, which is based on meals, crew size, and quality of the seats. The tutorial could have been better because it didn't tell me what any of the symbols that describe the airplanes specs mean, but it's pretty simple to figure out, from left to right: seats on the plane, cruising speed of the plane, maximum distance the plane can travel, and fuel consumption. All of these things along with meals, crew size, and quality of seats determine a routes ""flight rating."" Passengers tend to fly with the airline that has a higher ""flight rating"" and there are three other airlines that you have to compete with to try to have higher ""flight ratings"" in order to try to get as many passengers to fly with your airline. You start the game in 1960 and I think it goes on to 2009 (I say this because the game crashed for me at the end of 2009, and I'm not sure if that is suppose to signify the end or not). Again, for a $5 game, this is a good simulation/strategy game. I don't know what the other reviewers expected out of this game and how most of them came up with a review with less than an hour of gameplay, but I enjoyed it. It took me about 14 hours of playing time to go from 1960 to 2009."

So i have tried the first game of the franchise, and it did have some really nice features and worked smoothly, and i thought a sequel could really make gameplay a bit more complete. And yes, they invented a few nice new features, but overall gameplay suffered because all those good things from the first part of the franchise were gone...If you do get this game, small piece of advice: dont try setting up a big airline. By the time you have grown your airline big, you will pay more and more for your existing airplanes. so keep it light and small and update your airplanes every 2 to 3 years.... yes, annoying."

As someone who has played virtually every airline simulation that has come down the pike, from Airbucks to Aerobiz Supersonic to Airlines 1 & 2, Airline Tycoon and many other PC based as well as online sims, this ranks as the worst hands down.  There is no strategy involved .. you just pick 2 cities and a plane (and the planes don't even have names - just a bunch of numbers and you have to figure out what they mean) and you try to match the number of seats per month to the demand.  Once a route is open, you cannot alter it in any way.  I never ask for refunds but this is a definite."
