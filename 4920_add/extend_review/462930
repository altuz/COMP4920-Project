,Recommended,462930,29467756,Posted: 24 January,all,Z.i.Z.Z.ダークネス+,"As of 1/24/17, this game has become MUCH more playable. Comrades are still a part of the game, but they don't accumulate NEARLY as slow as before. There have been numerous, helpful research trial and experiment improvements added, which aid progression even further. The only downside I can think of is that scientists may be a little too easy to stockpile. You only need to 5 to activate the Comrade x7777 trial, which is one of the main reasons why progression has improved. I would either slim down a few achievement scientist awards, or make the x7777 trial a bit more costly. Aside from that, it's gotten a lot better.This game was virtually unplayable, at a point, for nearly 2 months, but now, it's fallen back on my radar. It's nearly as fun progressing here as it is in AdCap. I'm curious to see what they'll do next."
,Recommended,462930,29916857,Posted: 14 February,all,Jeath (Spoon Ninja),"This is the sequel to AdVenture Capitalist, but with a communist twist and completely different interface. The game is a clickcer resource collection game with a nice retro 1950s era look to it. All tho the game is in early access it still plays well and has balanced resources. There are in game purchases to move along quicker but they are not compulsary and you can still advance without them. The dev's seem to take note of the feedback they are given and do regular updates.Overall an enjoyable game for the clicker genre."

Personally I enjoyed this game and I believe this is an intresting take on their previous game; AdVenture Capitalist, Here are the pros and cons.Pros:It's freeYou can get decently far into the game without paying a single dollarGood humor (Subjective)Nice music (Subjective)Straight forward tutorialVery slightly more depth than AdVenture CapitalistCons:Later on progress is greatly halted without payingInterface is a bit odd (Subjective)I would recommend this game to people who enjoy casual games such as: AdVenture Capitalist, Cookie Clicker (or just any clicker game honestly), and maybe tycoon games."

I went to the steam page, and I was very suprised about how so polished it is. I've discovered no bugs/expolits, and it makes you feel like you are some kind of god of potatoes, land, ore, weapons, and medicine, as only for playing half an hour, you'll have numbers like 2.87E+008, sounds crazy right? this is why I like the game so much, because it gives you a feeling of acoompilshment for barely doing anything at all! it's glorious! plus, it has funny cartoon pictures of a man building his communist state.IN SOVIET RUSSIA, GAME CLICK YOU AND IT ENJOYS IT"

76561198041808542,Recommended,462930,30166977,Posted: 25 February,all,unclefreddy,"Probably the first game I've come across that involves the humble potato. Call 'em what you like, spuds, murphys, taters and cooked just the way you like them, I prefer chipped or roast potatos. Without the potato you can do nothing in the early stages so it's all about the potato.Once you have a healthy store of potatos you can then get on to other things, but don't forget the potato, more adventerous folk may like them hasslebacked, fiddly, but jolly nice too.The game will happily run while you are away, this is useful for keeping those potato stocks up, because when you come back you will probably find a use for them. The game is free and that is handy for real life when you may need to purchase actual potatos, it also runs well on my potato spec laptop.(No King Edwards, we're communist here. Other varieties are available. Personally I like the Maris Piper for a good versatile all rounder) There is more to it than just potatos, but, comrade, I must not give to much away to the capitailists.I'm sure there is even more potato based punnery that I could use here,however I have a nice hot jacket potato just about ready to eat, just need to grate some cheese to go over the top. Yummy."

,Recommended,462930,29545547,Posted: 28 January,all,TefeK #493msi,"Five hours in (one hour of active playing), I can already notice the scientist system (hard to obtain / bought with real money, the exact same system like AdCap gold bars) is too impactful as it allows you to run through the game at 500 times the normal speed (which is slow). You need to nerf scientists and increase the pace of game without the scientist buffs.The daily drop system needs a small touch too as it bottlenecks you after your scientist pool runs dry.Anyway, the concept of exponential growth (e.g. Hives > Plantations > Collectives > Communes > Farmers > Potatoes) is interesting and has potential, but is not fully implemented yet (Medicine).There are some bugs, the most noticeable is that Hard Reset only changes scientists to 0.Personally I think this game will be more fun to play than Adventure Capitalist once it is done.Currently6.5 / 10"

In AdCap, you have 3 different planets to manage with 12 different products on each and you're encouraged to reset frequently for them sweet angel investors. there's a lot to keep you busy, enough to spend a few minutes on it every day, which is perfect for an idle game. But in these, you really just have 5 products to track and invest in and nothing else to do.It may look like there's more at first glance, but for example under the potatoes page, you'll see that potatoes are made by farmers, and communtes create farmers, and collectives create communes, and so on. This means that you only buy the top-chained item you have unlocked at that moment, so you're only tracking the 5 resources. Very uninvolved and boring."

Check for the save data type, this means usually adding in a version identifier to save game data if not already there. You check for the new game data first, if that doesn't exist revert to old.2. Load appropriate save.3. Upon saving the game you will be saving in the new format anyways so the problem is now self corrected and took pretty much 0 additional work."

The scientists that were bought dissapeared after the tutorial ended?still very fun but i hope the developer see this. id also like to appoligize for any spelling and gramer mistakes.

The only gripe that I have is that almost every time the game has a major update, it won't let me play because it's unable to authenticate.  This has literally happened after every major update.  Fix this issue, please."

(1 final tier building of each resource.)I also found where they moved the settings button... It's unfortunately, really in the way, making it so I constantly misclick on it. Oh well.My original negative review was quite salty. Keeping it for historical purposes: Out of the blue they reset ALL my progress. (Destructive change in the way they save data.) I love resetting as long as I get something out of it. This time there was nothing to gain, however. What a technically inept developer. Couldn't be bothered to make a savegame converter.Edit: Oh, and they also removed settings with this update and now the ESC button closes the entire game instead of just the popups/menus I have open. Downgrade is strong."

You're kinda missin' out on the vibe I'm getting from this.So, in all honesty... I LOVE this game! It's my favorite kind of clicker, the process on how getting workers is really accurate, and truthfully? Communism is a hilarious meme on the internet, but it's displayed very realistically on the television screens. Plus, the Russian-like text dialog is funny.All in all, I give this game a fair 8/10. Hyper Hippo, keep updating!! I'd love to see how this game turns out!!"
,Recommended,462930,29456768,Posted: 23 January,all,ThatOneWriter,"After the latest update, the game has become much more enjoyable. I made much more progress in the week since the update than I did in the month (my best guestimate) or so that I was playing before. The buttons especially feel more useful, partially because I was able to get enough scientists to fully upgrade them all.In hindsight, starting over from scratch was a worthwhile price to pay in exchange for getting a much more enjoyable experience. My only concern now is that there might be too many scientists available, but given how much there is to spend scientists on, it feels like a better fit into the AdCap model where spending money wasn't necessary, but allowed for faster progression for those who don't have the time or patience to wait around.My only lingering gripe is that the achievements aren't Steam achievements. I always love finding games I can pile up achievements on."

This would be especially useful after you buy a colony or the like and have to re unlock all -based unlocks. Still a great game and I love it!"

Any way in which you could fix this would helpful.

I can see the possibility of themed expansion, ala Adventure Capitalist's worlds, but a fun little game already. It's an idle game, so if you're looking for storyline or substance, look elsewhere. This is idle/clicktoy gaming. Treat it as such."
,Recommended,462930,29844180,Posted: 11 February,all,xXrollandXx,Basically its adventure capitalist without managers. I know that is over simplifying it a little but it is how the basics work. A lot of people do not like this game but in truth i actually enjoy it.

,Recommended,462930,29638840,Posted: 1 February,all,kamorth,"If you like idle/incremental games that are straight forward and basic, this isn't for you. If you want to play an idle game that requires a little bit of thought and strategy, you've found one.With there being multiple resources, but only so many people you can allocate to collecting them, you have to make choices about where to deploy your comrades. Do you want more medicine or is collecting potatoes good enough for you? Ore for industry or warheads for conquest? Just like your comrades, your scientists can only work on one thing at a time too, so do you want them increasing the quality of healthcare or working on more devestating WMDs? Scientists are even MORE limited than comrades (even if you pump real money into the game) so you have to choose wisely.I'm thoroughly enjoying the game so far. I like having something that can run in the background while I work and only needs me to pay attention to it once every hour or two and that's why I like idle games. I've found with many of them I've gotten bored very quickly, within a few hours usually, and that includes AdVenture Capitalist. However, with AdVenture Communist, I'm having fun working out where to spend my resources and feeling like my choices are actually having an effect on how MY game plays out. I definitely recommend this one."
