,Not Recommended,462960,22934763,"Posted: 12 May, 2016",all,Thehagengnome,"Pros:....Cons:looks old and uglyVery basic platformer without much depth or originalityBoring gameplayThis game is simply put a very generic platformer that looks 10 years old, doesn't have anything original about it and has in my opinion a very basic and boring gameplay loop. There is nothing about this game that can make me recommend it above most of it's peers. It looks pretty bad, feels kind of strange when it comes to the controls and half of the time seems purely nonsensical. Because of all of this, i can find no argument to use your money or time on this game when you have so many other much better choices out there. If you Still want to look at this game some more, you can check out my video of it below.Gameplay video:https://youtu.be/Zgd3sOJ5CBA"
,Not Recommended,462960,31768122,Posted: 15 May,all,Verdantil,"Tags: PlatformerAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: A very poor experienceReview: Audiovisually pretty poor with Early 3D era look and feel to the game. Textures are pretty bad. Ennemies dont attack but just walk back and forth injuring you if you touch them. I pressed everything on my controller and I could not attack even though I am holding a club. All I could do is run and jump. The jump felt very artificial, jumping in one short and low height burst and stopping abruptly, very unsatisfying. Sprint uses stamina and does not nearly improve the speed much at all, stamina depletes very quickly. Most level design is just a bunch of easy to reach platforms with fruits everywhere to jump and collect. Game says to look around before jumping but using the controller I could not move the camera elsewhere leading to blind jumps, sometimes with fruit to tempt you, that leads you to plunge to your death. If you soldier on its mostly just about gathering keys, getting through archways and activating checkpoints. All in all this is a very unsatisfying title in a saturated genre and is outclassed by just about anything. Even the SNES donkey kong country would feel a lot better than dealing with this."

Enemies continue to attack while you're adjusting options. They also attack while the camera pans away after picking up a key- Music volume option will not save properly. I set music volume all the way to 0, but it still plays in some levels until I go back to options, turn it up and back down again.- Random spike intervals: They do not behave the same every time you restart a level. Different pattern everytime.- The small bee attack is almost impossible to see. I have no idea how to avoid it- Snake is unpredictable, I never know if I'm in the clear or not (I know, avoid the head, but the snake turns around too fast)- Unavoidable spike damage at the end of in 1-8, making 3 stars impossible- If two eggs get close to each other it's very difficult to separate them, they don't rotate like stone wheels and the caveman's weight isnt enough to wedge himself between the two.- Level 3-3 has a piece of meat at the start that cannot be picked up- Random spike intervals- Inconsistent checkpoint behavior: sometimes damage sends me back to a checkpoint, sometimes I get hurt but I can keep going.- In one of the first levels I got too close to a rock at high speed, and this resulted in my controls being inverted: left arrow would move the character right and viceversa- Did I mention random spike intervals?"

,Not Recommended,462960,30662669,Posted: 21 March,all,Assholemon: Eijo Joestar,"This was quite a weird game to play and it does have some charisma in it, maybe it was for the puns or jokes that unga boonga said, maybe it was for the attempt of making some interesting game mechanics like the log jumping or maybe it is due to the awful graphics that does have some identity instead of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ asset flips or maybe it is due to the unpolished gameplay or for it being an obvious unity game.I mainly bought this game to see if this could be the next bad rats. But there was something that I did appreciate from this game. But to be honest the game is bad and there's no way around it.You know that the game is not good when the game flintstones the rescue of dino and hoppy (or better known as 7 grand dad for the high quality rippers) has better game design, more polished gameplay and it came out decades ago (even though that game is decent/good).Gameplay: This is the main focus and the biggest problem of the game because the game is very unpolished and it clear once you play the game. But it also tries 1 or 2 interesting gameplay mechanics that was too ambitious for it.The gameplay is your typical platformer where you collect items and you go through a certain place where your family is located in order to beat the stage, through it you'll find some different obstacles that you'll have to face in order to collect all of the stars (yes, it's one of those mobile looking games with a 3 star raiting) and some other animals that will block your way.The 3 main (and biggest) problems are that it's unpolished because you'll have some trouble with certain tools (like the stone wheel or the log) due to their physics not working for you and that it has horrible game design because of the placement of the enemies and how some spikes are located and the fact that they don't have predictable patterns.There's a good reason why good platformers have predictable patterns and some of the random parts do have some sort of a patter, because that helps with speedruning and to have a higher success at getting the high score. Since the spikes are random it can be very hard to progress without getting hit.As for the enemies they don't have a predictable way to attack you, this is especially with snakes since it's very hard to avoid those ♥♥♥♥ers. And worst case scenario is that you won't have much room to jump above them, thus you'll have to risk taking hit in order to progress.And finally you respawn completely at random when an enemy hits you. Since sometimes they hit you and you still go though the stage, while in other times they hit you and you have to start from the checkpoint. This inconsistency can be very annoying.And if you add those 2 you'll have a bad time, minutes of frustration and some deaths that could've been prevented if you could've had more space, proper hitboxes or more polished gameplayBut the unpolished gameplay can work in your benefict like a double edge sword. If you know how to exploit this you can get though some areas faster or avoid getting hit.Another problem but not very big (but it would've made the game more tolerable) is having an attack button, I do appreciate that they tried to make it more challenging by having to avoid enemies instead of confronting them, but thanks to the bad design they don't have the luxury to have that. At the very least making me kill some snakes, little bugs or velociraptors would've made this more tolerable and would retained some hearts.The tools are typical things you've seen in other games, like a trampoline, a wheel, a fountain, etc None of them very special. but there's a thing that I have to give credit, the log mechanics are very interesting, it does uses the physics of wall jumping but is a more clever way to get through the other area. It consistes of putting the log near the edge and going through that edge on the log, then as the log goes down you go to the other side so that you'll gain momentum to go jump to the other side.Now that doesn't mean that it's 100% good, since it suffers from the previous mentioned elements.Finally there's a system of upgrading your hearts and energy when you have 5 stars, I recommend using more on hearts than energy (2-1) but you shouldn't discard energy since it does help in the long run.Controls: Unlike the unpolished and horrible game design, the controls are decent and you won't have problem handling through most of the levels that is untill you jump, since it does have a very short range unless you're on a trampoline or an object. I've played worse.Story: The game has 0 story besides gathering food for your family, so there's no point in considering it.Graphics: Let's be honest, they're ugly,♥♥♥♥♥♥and not pleasant to look at. But I did for some reason like them and it does irradiates charm. There's something special about bad graphics that they kind of grow in you. So I'll give them a positive note.Soundtrack: Generic but it serves it purpose and it's typical caveman songs. I did like them though and didn't mind listening to them for hours.Extras: Part of the charm comes from the puns/jokes that unga boonga spews, they're hit and miss, since not everyone will find them funny but It's a nice thing they've decided to put in the game.Overrall: I kinda enjoyed the game and for the ridiculous price that it has it might not be a bad buy. And a part of me wanted to recommend this because it's not that horrible. But it is bad no matter how you look at it since it suffers from unpolished gameplay, bad game design and lack of a game attack, and those 2 things killed this game from having a positive review since they're very important points to consider.You're better of looking for another game that has solid gameplay.This game is very easy and didn't mind the harder stages, but due to the previous points it makes it a chore to complete it 100%."

This is a game that everyone can play if they want to cause there are nothing that should be inapropiet for kids in my opinion.In this world you're a caveman with a bone club that he does not use to attack with. You can not kill anything in this game, but your object is to get home, collect things ranging from seashells, meat or fruit, but you can also crush eggs in some levels. The collecting and crushing is optional. You can get 3 stars at each level, there are 3 episodes and 9 levels in each episode giving you 27 episodes. You can use 5 stars to buy extra hearts and extra energy, you start with 3 hearts and 3 seconds energy.Enemys in this game have a 180 turning angle and they will flit at the drop of a hat. Mammoths, dinosaurs, bugs and more are your enemy variations. Each attack will take 1 heart from you and if you lose them all then you need to do that level from the begining. Fire, pitfalls, lifts and  automatic spikes will also try to kill you. The 2 lights beside eachother are you checkpoints. If you get sent back to the checkpoint after being attacked or not seems to be up to random chance.The graphics aren't that good, there is no story apart from get home to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ family that isen't helping you while collecting optional stuff on your way and the soundtrack is repetetive. The 7th level in the 3rd chapter the hardest in the game thanks to 2 hard jumps, unlike the end of the game, other then that this is kind of a easy game. The controll aren't as responsive as I would have liked and the trailer for this game showed it in a much better graphical light then what we got even at the best graphics it didn't look that good. There are achievements in the game now, but if you have a save from before the acheivements then it will be hard to get them and there are badges. If you stand still then the caveman will saw different caveman and dinosaur puns that are cheesy at best, but there is no voice acting in this one so the puns are in text bobbles.If these things turn you off then I advice you to not buy this, or buy it to check it out for yourself.Have fun, enjoy and ugh bugh :)"

Yet, your stamina bar will probably never empty, because each time you collect a ""collectible"" (a cute name for a fruit, I guess) you fill a bit (a lot) of your bar. Also, if you stay still you also will fill your stamina bar pretty quickly. That makes the stamina bar completely useless.The enemies here are really ridiculous, also.

,Recommended,462960,30603360,Posted: 18 March,all,Sir useless,"Sometimes i wonder where my life will be going in the near future, hopefully my future will include working with Grabthegames studio. Caveman World: Mountains of Unga Boonga is an age old tale of a retired war vet, trying to win back the favor of the son he abandon and his new family in hopes of finaly foarging a bond he never had. Something to be noted is that this game is very dark, so if you are emotinally unstable or simply cannot handle an emotinal rollar coaster this game is not for you. As a man who has spent the majority of his 38 years on this planet playing games, i can not give enough praise to the master piece that is Caveman World: Mountains of Unga Boonga. If you want a rogue-like RPG with a dash of 1950's noire elements and story telling that would rival Citizen Kane, this is the game for you."

Also, you can get coupons for it from crafting badges (like I would spend 2 dollars on this crap)"

The jumping mechanic is lazy and bug-ridden. Trying to manipulate objects in the the levels is a nightmare, as is trying to avoid the ""animals"". Negatives aside, it was briefly amusing, but can't recommend overall with such a weak attempt at gameplay."

Very misleading.And whether or not you get sent back to the checkpoint seems to be random and sometimes, it's impossible to jump over certain enemies under certain circumstances.To be perfectly honest, the game isn't bad but since I can't give a middle of the road review score..."

It's set in a prehistoric timeline, it will keep u busy probably for the first 10 min, just wondering why I'm doing this?!?!? A platform adventure game to be avoided :)PS: Everything u read in here is a personal statement, coming from my point of view and maybe not reflecting what the game itself looks like."
