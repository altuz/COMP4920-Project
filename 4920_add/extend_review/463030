Walking around didn't sound like it'd b much fun, i can go outside & do that, but the lovely landscapes & the nice piano soundtrack made me reconsider.There's a path to follow that takes you through the game, but you are free to explore as much (or as little) as you want. There was 1 minor jumping puzzle that took me a couple of tries (i hate platformers), but even i passed it on my 3rd attempt. Nothing overly complicated & all in all i found the game quite relaxing.The graphics were pretty nice & the music was very fitting, sometimes almost haunting when you combine the piano with the landscapes."

The game is short, so do not expect from game some kind of a massive story. The graphic is really good and i liked that the game is verybright, fresh and soothing. I liked the music too, it was really enjoyable to walk on the path and hear somesounds of naturelike wind, birds, trees and water. The big plus for achievement hunters is that this game has a7 easy achievementsso you can do 100% game. I think this game could feel free to have a longer story and they should add tone of horror game.The low priceis really fair to the fact, that game is just walking simulator and it is really short. I recommend this game for screenshooters because there's a lot of positions that may make seriously unique screenshots.+ fair price+ relaxing music+ noir mode (great addition to a game)- short storyWalk NoirAfter passing game you can play a new mode - walk noir. Already the name implies that it will have something to do with black or dark color. It is a new mode in which you follow the same path but thegraphic is darker. If you want 100%  achievements, you have to also complete it.8/10"

The store is rather flat, sadly, and there's not really much to explore. I'd really wish there had been something more to the notes.Maybe it's my fault for expecting more, but unless you really enjoy looking at trees and snow and nothing more for 20 minutes at a time, this is not for you."

I have to admit I was not aware of them until I completed the Bottle.I think the game's synopsis pretty much sums it up. What it does not mention, however, is the great graphics it has. It is, unfortunately, not very well optimised, but later on we might get to see a couple of more updates regarding this issue.The accompanying music is great and while some of the colours are a bit too vivid the snowy forest looks great. The game is short and can be completed in roughly an hour. Its noir mode is basically the same game but under a different filter.Whilst I liked Bottle I understand some of the negative feedback. Let's just say it is mainly for the fans of the genre. In terms of storyline it makes you think, however, it is far from the complexity and excitement of Leviathan. Still, this is a great purchase for fans."
,Recommended,463030,31668872,Posted: 10 May,all,Stachmo,"Bottle is quite a solid first person adventure game that helped me relax a lot and feel great until the ending. Beauty is clearly highlighted in this one and is purely eye candy for the audience. It creates such a relaxing and satisfying atmosphere that would inspire the player to play around and take some screenshots for good ole fun. Sure, it's VERY short but is something worthwhile to experience. I love the fact there is an additional mode (walk noir) added after completing the first adventure. The difference is basically it changed from day to night with an alternative ending.How does this rank among all the walking simulators out there? It's among the tier 2 games of the genre (there are four tiers in my book which tier 1 is the highest quality). This means Bottle is definitely something to take an adventure in!

There are a lot of things wrong with this game, that could have been done better.Graphics: It's the Unreal 4 Engine, still looks not very good and the level is just a huge, huge landscape with lot of trees and a small cave. There is basically nothing to look at. There is just nothing. You could also save your money and look at a white wall.Music is pretty good, but it would much better fit, if the game would be a litle bit faster. Sounds are pretty bad and ruin that silent, desperate feeling of being alone in the snow.

,Recommended,463030,24941350,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,Twistor,"Briefly:Bottleis a short and pretty walking simulator. As a game it's not particularly good: it has only little gameplay and few lines of story that needs a bit of contemplation just to interpret it. Yet for its other aspects Imightrecommend it to you.As a member of the newborn genre of walking simulators,Bottlestarts with an open bottle and a glass of wine. Then you, some non-described man, go outside and find notes left by a vision.Since I would considerBottleto be an art game, this review contains slightly more of my personal feelings than my usual reviews. In essence this is amixedreview with a slightly positive leaning.Serene milieuTo me the nicest bits inBottleare the pleasant and colourful (or in the other playthrough, dark and noir) environments. Exploration grants you a few interesting details that you might otherwise miss. Camera can be zoomed out for that perfect screenshot, though this makes the shadows flicker annoyingly and on a higher setting it could deck the frame rate.SinceBottleis close to a pure walking simulator you should know that if you wish for interesting gameplay, there's almost none of that here. The only interactions are simple clicks around hotspots and walking through them. The most complicated bits are of jumping up stone blocks to get to a hotspot to progress the story.There are two different playthroughs, with distinct graphical styles and alternate endings to the story.There's no save game option: you got to do the half-an-hour long completion in one shot. Given the game is so short I think this was not a problem. Saving and loading might even hurt the already peculiar story.Music is a nice touch when it plays, though most of the sound effects are ambiance of wind blowing or occasional rustling leaves or howling wolves that are nowhere to be seen. I'm not sure if it's implied, but to me it somehow conveyed an anxious feeling of being watched.And what about the story?While exploring around the island you may find interesting details. Occasional mocking reference to common video game tropes is refreshing, and other scenes build a blurry background for the story.Peculiarly, the living creatures that inhabit the mysterious island stand still and lack any animations, so one can just go and jump on them a bit without any reaction (which is silly when the object is e.g. a deer). Perhaps the setting is all just a dream or a metaphor.Ultimately the game wants to rail-road you and make you follow the path. Narrative proceeds by finding the vision of a woman who speaks in ghastly incomprehensible verses and finding the letters she leaves behind. These cryptic messages are the only verbal information about the story you get.The whole game is just half an hour long. The ending may leave you perplexed and full of questions. Who is the lady? What do the messages mean? What do(es) the ending(s) mean? In fact, what is the purpose of it all?Afterwards, the game curiously plays longer inside one's head than on screen.ConclusionsTwo different playthroughs took me just one hour, played right after each other. The story was a bit confusing to me, and only after trying to make sense of it for a couple of days had I made a bit of meaning to it. Is my interpretation what the developer was looking for? I'm not sure.Had it been any more expensive I would not be so sure. But for a 2€ game it's potentially a thought-provoking experience at its best, and boring and confusing waste of time and money at its worst depending on your stance. Since I like to ponder games and stories afterwards, to me it was worth both the time and coin.Indeed, I considerBottlenot strictly a game but a piece of (barely) interactive art: pretty, perplexing and wonderful. Purchasing it is akin to getting a ticket to a gallery or a (cheap) film. If you are bored by them you should likely stay away fromBottleas well. However, if you instead find galleries or art films alluring I think you should definitely experienceBottle."

76561198048974498,Recommended,463030,31703184,Posted: 12 May,all,rjmacready,"Bottle is the third game by Tonguc Bodur, the lead designer of Drizzlepath and Drizzlepath: Genie. Since I enjoyed both of those games, I thought I'd try his third game, Bottle...and since I own the rest of his repertoire I'll probably skip to the next one shortly after that. Heck, they're short enough, and it's not often one gets to review six games in a row by a single developer who, while sticking to one persistent genre (""walking simulators""), tends to mix things up a little from game to game (and apparently works with slightly different supporting artists, like writers and voice actors, from project to project).So what do you get with Bottle? Well, you get gorgeous semi-open snowscapes and a slightly surreal lack of footstep sound effects, as well as the occasional item to interact with, the occasional note to read, and the occasional eerie female character who persistently shows up and appears to be possessed, considering that when she speaks, she is Legion. The music is also very pretty and conducive to a contemplative mood, but I did kind of miss the voice narration element so common to this genre (though the sound of just the cold wind blowing, animal noises, and the occasional rustling of foliage below your feet does still evoke quite an atmosphere). The developer does in any case appear to have learned a lesson from his previous game, Drizzlepath: Genie, by returning the game's length to one more suitable for what is, ultimately, a leisurely stroll through a lovely landscape (that said, this one could easily have been a bit longer, given its thirty to sixty minute duration).""Waitaminute...THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES?"" I hear you cry. Hey - it's two bucks, with cards, less in a bundle or a sale. Get over yourself. Indie devs have to eat too.My biggest complaint about the game would be that it ultimately all feels a bit directionless, unlike the dev's previous two games in which there was a genuine sense of a journey, created by a generally clear path to follow and the vague narrative flow of the voice-over narrations. I suspect the game might last even LESS than thirty minutes, if you don't have as much of a propensity for getting lost and running into invisible walls as I do. (I was oddly grateful for the invisible walls, though, 'cause they were about the only thing which stopped me from walking several MILES in the wrong direction before realising I'd given myself a bum steer. It also didn't help that I plum walked past a cave I was meant to enter, and didn't find it again 'til ten minutes later.)I'm not afraid to declare this my least favourite of Tonguc's games so far, but I have three more to go and have reason to believe they will only get better. If you're in the market for an abundance of either gameplay or story, this probably isn't the product for you. If, on the other hand, you genuinely enjoy going for a very relaxing, casual wander through beautifully-rendered digital landscapes, you may well love this, and get as much as hours of enjoyment from exploring its every inch and attaining every Achievement. It really does come down to individual taste. Me, I'm a little more into the story-oriented end of things, and can take or leave Achievements at the best of times, but if you suspect there's even the smallest chance you'll get some joy from this, that low, low price really is a bit of a no-brainer.Verdict: 6.5/10."

,Not Recommended,463030,31425247,Posted: 28 April,all,Son of a submariner,"Bottle tries really hard to emulate the ""Dear Esther""-feeling. but it fails. It is much shorter but there is still much less to find in it. To me, one core idea of the walking simulator genre is that there has to be stuff to explore, stuff to find within an somewhat intresting story. (One reason I love some good ""walking simulators"" and see them as games as any other genre). in bottle, there is nothing of this sorts. The is no story, the are glimpses of a narative background without backing up, without any flesh on it. Secondly, there is nothing to see, you get thrown into a Thomas Kinkade Kitsch Painting: snow, pink sky, snow, trees and a stupid uninspired conclusion."

From what I read from the notes and my personal thoughts on this game, I think it's safe to say that our main protagonist is an alcoholic.This game has some pretty nice graphics especially since the game's engine is the Unreal Engine 4. I love the pretty snowy white environments on the game. I also REALLY love the music score on this game! The piano music on this game is phenomenal and goes really well with the environment on this walking simulator game. I highly recommend this game if you're into walking simulator games."
,Recommended,463030,29088236,Posted: 7 January,all,Tablis,"A textbook example of a walking simulator, Bottle's ""game"" status will be contentious to some. There is no lose condition, no combat or action. You take in and explore the world (down a proverbial path) for some 20 minutes and that's it. There isn't even much of a storyline here.I found the winter scenery created in the Unreal engine outright impressive and pleasing after maxing out all the options. The glints of sunlight on snow, the semi-transparent ice, theexcellentlymade coniferous vegetation... There is some annoying pop-in on flowers and rock textures but these are minor technicalities. The visuals are nicely complemented by bits of piano music.WhileDear Esther(anabsolutely seminalwalking simulator) struck a decisively sad tone, Bottle opts for a less depressive experience. Which, in this context, still lands it barely on ""neutral"" with just a hint of wistfulness and regret. Overall, Bottle is still at least two leagues below Dear Esther in terms of quality, attention to detail, length, writing, emotional impact, raw atmosphere. But for a dolla on sale it's a nice diversion and the achievements are very easy."

It's like a short story that's been pushed out into an epic novel with lots and lots of filler but no substance. It has a pretty thin plot. I am a drunk guy who wakes up to find I am out of wine and needs to walk to my fishing shack. Because reasons. On my way over I hallucinate images of my ex who may or may not be dead and I am not handling being alone and out of wine very well.The world is completely free roaming, but there isn't anything to do. It's a mountain. And snow. And trees. Oh look. Another mountain. And snow. And trees. Hey, there's a mountain. And snow. And trees. Go through a cave/tunnel. It's another mountain. And snow. And trees. Cross a bridge. Obligatory mountain. Obligatory snow. Obligatory trees. The background music matched this theme. Song One. Minute of silence. Song One. Minute of silence. Song One. Minute of silence. Song One.To get any story line you MUST follow the path in the snow and you MUST read the message left where phantom girl was standing, which will sometimes require effort to get and sometimes be just given to you. The message will be 20 words or less and taunting? haunting? insulting? accusatory? Sometimes it's a clue to swirl of speedy power to get you down that path in the snow just that much quicker. The clues aren't even all that necessary because if you just follow the path you will find them anyway. One clue, by the way, will be 6000 miles and two time zones away from the swirl of speedy power to which it is referring. Thanks, cryptic (not really) clue.In order for me to wander in this world, I need significant more narration, more storyline, and/or more soundtrack. Something, anything, to make me want to explore and most of all, linger on that mountain. With snow. And trees.

It doesn't contain any traditional gaming elements, and the ""story"" is minimalistic to the point of being opaque.  That said, it looks very nice, is well thought-out, and contains pleasant music.For folks who are drawn to walking-simulators, note that this title is developed by a single person.  I'd caution against comparing it too harshly against similar titles like Dear Esther, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, or Lifeless Planet.  It lacks the philosophical ""depth"" of Dear Esther and has none of the puzzle elements of Ethan Carter or Lifeless Planet.  It is also much shorter.  Each of those other titles aspire to different goals than Bottle, which foresakes plot, narration, and interactivity for beauty and mood.It accomplishes that goal very well.  Just be aware of what you're buying when you purchase this title--a very short, pretty walking-sim with a minimal artifice of plot."

,Not Recommended,463030,24755585,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,jk,"Much like Drizzlepath, Bottle feels like a shallow imitation of a game like Dear Esther. They check all of the boxes - you're placed in a pretty environment, you walk through it, and along the way you get bits of a story. But they fail to make real connections between the environment and the story, or tell much of a story at all.There are unnecessarily long stretches between events - I spent 35 minutes in this game, and it could have easily been 5 if you removed the long walks in which I assume you're supposed to admire the scenery.You're free to wander from the path a fair distance, but I never found anything doing this, and it only left me with the frustration of having to slowly trudge back to where the game wanted me to be. At one point, particles swirled around me, and my speed increased for a brief period, as if the game could sense my boredom and sped my way to the next event. While the speed boost was welcome, it felt random and made my normal walking speed feel even slower afterward.The same thing happens in every event - a woman stands there, some backwards VO plays, she disappears as you get close, and you're left with a note that makes no sense. It's clearly trying to be deep, and maybe there is a meaning to be deciphered from them, but they all fell flat.But the most ridiculous parts were the two instances that incorporated some 3D platforming to get to the woman. This game is actually 95% walking simulator and 5% platformer. Given the little attention generally payed to movement controls in these games, it was not a welcome addition.I wanted to like this game, just as I wanted to like Drizzlepath, but both left me with the feeling that these are just slapped together assets with very little care and understanding of the medium, just to tell a story that never really comes through. It's a game that asks more of the player than it offers in return. I'm skeptical, but keep a tiny bit of hope that the developer will learn from these games and eventually come out with something a little more polished."

I was a big fan of Drizzlepath, the first game by the same developer, and this one takes the formula a step further. This is a purist walking sim. The largest part of the enjoyment here is pondering the curious shining, sparkling virtual reality you are taking a walk through. Much like Drizzlepath, the few story (poetry?) fragments are incomprehensible, but serve primarily to set the mood a little. What's particularly neat with this one is that on completion you unlock a ""noir"" mode that renders the whole thing in grainy black-and-white and creates a completely different take on the same journey. It's very well done. If you're looking for a ""game game"" this is probably not for you, but if you like walking sims, this is another delightful entry in the genre."

I don't mind the short play time, it takes 15 minutes from start to finish if you just move ahead, but I wasted 1 hour and a half in it. What I mind is that it doesn't really tell a story, not in a meaningful or satisfying way at least.I appreciate short games if they give me a nice experience or something barely meaningful, but this one didn't do much of that.

,Recommended,463030,31000003,Posted: 7 April,all,Yldrania,"Game Review: ★★★ (3/5 Stars)What we have here is an indie game with extraordinarily good graphics. I played this game on the highest settings and it was a journey through heaven. The landscape was absolutely beautiful and the background music very relaxing. Bottle is a Walking Simulator - and it takes that title very seriously. The gameplay consists of one main thing: Walking!Apart from a few notes we can find and pick up, and a short sequence in the beginning and the end of the game, there is nothing but a very linear, almost non-existing storyline. A few implications are made, but there is no consistent story or setting that I could find. I've tried exploring a little bit and got lost with no pointers as to where to get back to the path I had to go, which means that while the game is somewhat open world, it's potentially very frustrating when you decide to use that feature.To me, for the purposes of a ""bedtime story"" type of game to calm down before going to sleep, it definitely does its job, but as a game in general, it's at most acceptable even though beautiful.Find my playthrough here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnXrvVY-5XY&index=1&list=PLYzlb9Rw0iBQ664OykTEMMlCers7JrJo1"

,Recommended,463030,30356352,Posted: 6 March,all,WeegyBro,"Underrated, I must sayWhere should I start?Clearly, walking simulator is a simulation that demands the player to walk. That's that. Nothing else matters when we come to a walking-simulator-tagged game. This one, tho, is more than only walking. Like how walking simulators should be, this one has art. And it's beautiful. Let's talk about the arts, yea?PlottingBasically, it's about a guy who ""lost"" things and the one he loves. Perhaps, she left him, or the otherwise. The plot you SEE is just you walking from your little house through snow and a cave for like 25 minutes and read notes and get to a hut to get more bottle of (wine?). But, the art in it is much more. Why is there this woman? Why isthe bottle empty and let you walk for nothing? That's where the art do its job.Not being too optimistic, butthe plot talks about life(in my perspective). Why? Have you ever gone through that time where you're trying to reach something you want, but there are a lot of attractions that gives you dilemmas? Well, those dilemmas in fact make you forget the thing you're trying to reach. That's how this game talks to me. That situation was well implemented by the developers by making an analogy of the representation of the player, the woman, the nature, and the bottle. Well done, developers, for I like how you plot it.Generated ImageryTalking about graphics, it's immersive. There are of course pros and cons.+ Stunning lighting+ Nice textures- 85% are snow, stones and treesAtmosphere, you asked?Yeah, that's a must-have in walking simulators. I can say, that this game's atmosphere is deep when the soundtrack (composed inmostly piano) is playing. I wonder who's the composer, tho. I like the soundtrack. But, there is a design flaw. An audible ambience sound should be in the game, but it only appears in certain parts. And, the soundtrack is not a loop, so there are times where you walk with only the nature's voice. But that's somehow a good thing too.Additional notesNot only the notes for the review, but there is also notes in the game, which is also written in somehow ""gooderer"" than the game description itself. Well done, developers. There are also puzzles hidden in the notes. Walk Noir mode is a bit horror, especially when you see her.Overall, the game's good. Worthy to be liked.79/100"

Unlike Dear Esther, there is little to no story to draw you in, the landscape tells no story, there is no purpose to exploring save to find the invisble walls. Walk the path, read a couple of notes, and your done. At least with Dear Esther, there was stuff to look at that told a story of it's own, and the graphics were far superior.On a positive note, the piano music was nice."

You don't feel like an alcoholic who's wasted his life, not in the game at least.The biggest problem is the layout of the game. You're given a vague note, and surounded by a vast thundra. It takes so long to get to one of the few key events you start to wonder if you're supposed to leave the path and go off into the sparse wilderness. It's not helped that some of the notes you find seem to actively point you in the direction of places you're not supposed to go, you're told to follow where the stag is facing, but the stag is looking at an invisible wallThe pace you move at only exasperates this problem, with long drawn out spells of nothing. Something that the developer was clearly aware of as there's orbs that dramatically increase your speed.Bottle as it stands isn't a great game, but there's enough there that it can be learnt from. I could see the developers next game being a real improvement"

,Not Recommended,463030,35504741,Posted: 5 October,all,TheWoWExp,"TheWoWExp Reviews:Bottle☆☆☆☆☆Have you ever played a game, and by the time you finish, you're asking yourself, What was the point? That's basically what Bottle did to me.Once I completed the game, I didn't really feel like I achieved anything. I mean, there are several achievements you can acquire in this game, but when the summary tells you this is a short game, it truly means it's a short game.You can wander around off the beaten path.There are a few miscellaneous things to come across.There's even a second version you can play after you beat the normal mode.Like with Drizzlepath, the soundtrack isn't consistent, but there doesn't seem to be a trigger that I can notice. Maybe there is though. But if not, it's odd they'd make the game go completely quiet while you're in the middle of walking around with nothing but random rustlings nearby.Which is weird, because there's no wildlife. Whenever there's a rustling sound, don't worry. You're not actually being stalked by an animal.But unlike with Drizzlepath, the graphics in this game are repetitive. You see the same trees, the same boulders, the same flowers, the same textures. Worst of all, it's noticeable.The sunlight reflecting off the snow can be a bit too bright at times. And as one of my viewers on my Twitch streaming channel had said, ""This game tops the charts for visual glitches per second."" I can't exactly disagree with that statement. The graphics really aren't that great for this not being a first try at a game.There's a woman you come across on occasion, and the only way you'll be able to figure out what she says is if you replay her audio backwards. She's speaking backwards, but multiple times overlapping one another, so...it's gibberish. I don't know why they did this, but it seems pointless.Maybe you as the character are confused on why she said certain things to you in the past and this is him reflecting on it.Who knows.I certainly don't."

Limited content. Barely a showcase of unreal4 engine. Wonder if assets were purchased.HOLD W for 40 mins. Follow dirtpath in winter forest. Unbelievably streched out empty trails with the same recycled winter assets over and over. The few rare landmark inclusions are just empty shells with nothing inside. Literally cardboard cutouts. Nothing is interactable except a sprite of a woman. She disappears into a paper note that you can read for vague fluff text. After 40 mins you find a bottle in a  wooden shack and you find the end credits. The game tries to pretend it is artsy by making it a message about being alone or something and messages in bottles but it is pretty blatant and smacks you across the face with it. Kind of insulting too seeing as how this is just some low quality unreal 4 with bad winter effects, too much sparkling light effects that create this silly christmas feel, pointlelss film grain on top of the camera, disabled run button and no environment interaction such as making footsteps in the snow even. Audio was lackluster with boring piano droning on endlessly."
