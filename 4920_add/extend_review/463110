And yes, all three are sexualized in some fashion. From one of the characters beinghappythe lizard child doesn't want to get dressed, kissing the child on the lips, and doing it all in front of the mother - this game's pedophilic undertones are a bit more than just ""obvious"".I've always loved the old school point-and-click adventures but this is something different entirely, and it's pretty goddamn profane. Personally, I think the devs should be ashamed. Not just becaused they released a game that takes about 10 minutes to beat, but that they have the audacity to release something like this on Steam."

,Recommended,463110,23698896,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,BluePaw,"I got some mix feelings about this so bare with me.The music overall is... decent, but tries too hard to be DOS-music, I guess? I don't know. Some of it just didn't sit well with me while some I was okay with. I do wish more work was put in for the music. I can't find anymore words to comment on this.The story is simple and short (less than 30 minutes), however the setting I'm confused; medieval, tribes, and modern socity as one? Sounds like an interesting idea on paper, but execution needs to be planned very well, and this sorta went half-way on it. Good attempt though, I'll give it that much.The story alone feels like it's aimed more toward younger readers, however visually toward a mature audience, so unsure what target audience they were going for with this game. That's where most of my mix feelings come from, while partially from the music.The artstyle (I refuse to call it graphics for this game) is pretty simple as it can get for an old-school-esque adventure game. Took me a bit to understand the UI. However, I didn't like that I had to use a UI window to go in a direction than just simply click on it. That was the only issue I had with it that I found odd and inconvenient for me.I felt a bit stuck near the end, however noticed something peculiar with a bush that had a black hole in it the 2nd time I went by it.Sure there is nudity (which is not even a real focus I may add) but it's the more artsy kind of nudity (aka non-sexual aka non-fanservice, etc.), like drawing a live model in art class in college or the ancient greek sculptures. It usually fits well with tribal worlds than anything else so it sat very well with me.If people get that easily offended just by the sight of breasts or anyone nude in a non-sexual way, that's purely on them and their own problem for getting worked up about it. I fail to see how that can be the dev's fault.I did take a few minutes to try silly combinations and see what would happen (and this will really add up the game hours to find them all). Gotten a few chuckles but didn't explore every combination yet (good excuse to do while waiting for the card drops). Wanted to get the story done first to get this review up properly.This game isn't perfect, but isn't bad either. It's average more towards good. Worth the $0.99 though as I didn't see anything that I found disturbing as some people were exaggerating about, with zero technical issues to boot, and overall found it alright for the price. I did notice some grammar issues I would like to point out to the dev if I can, though, in private.So, yeah, not gonna ask for a refund just because I finished the story under 2hrs as that'll be abusing the refund policy since I did enjoy it and gave it a chance from start to finish.P.S.: I was, at some point, expecting the CG that's displayed on the steam store to show up. That would've been great. A mother reunited with her child that got lost in the forest after wondering off to it. ^_^ Guess it's not possible with this game. Shame, really.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish."

The three boys talk to the nude doctor and fetch him a mushroom so that he can make them drugs for their papa. Some naked lizard ♥♥♥♥♥ runs out before they leave though and ask them to look for her naked lizard daughter in the forest, the boys say they'll help but one of them is just trying to see what the inside of a cloaca feels like. They go to the forest, skip some rocks and pick some shroom, run into a sick fox that can ♥♥♥♥ing talk and nurture it back to health. The boyz then find the little girl's skirt in the bushes, give it to the fox and he helps them find the little lizard ♥♥♥♥♥. They find the naked little♥♥♥♥♥♥and end up having to fight a pig with a dull sword to save her, they ask if she wants her skirt back and she says no cause she wants to be naked and the mother ♥♥♥♥ing main dude is perfectly happy with that! He then can tickle, kiss and hug this naked girl, turns out he wasn't only trying to get into momma lizard's snatch but lil baby lizard hooha too. After returning to the village with the mushroom and girl the lady lizard is super happy that you saved her child and kisses the main dude, he then tickles her and asks if he can stay the night some time, but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adds that he wants to spend the night with the little girl too. Either this is the dencest ♥♥♥♥er who has ever lived or he's trying to get some mother daughter action going with a minor and a ♥♥♥♥ing lizard. Anyways they get the potion from the hippie flower eating naked lizard dude and then take the bus home. Did I mention that they're royalty taking the ♥♥♥♥ing bus to a village for medicine for their sick father? Are there not servents to do that♥♥♥♥♥♥and do none of them have a car? How does this society work anyways, they dress medieval, have horses, coexist with lizards but take the ♥♥♥♥ing bus? Anyways story over, king's sleepy or some♥♥♥♥♥♥and the little kid and aunt go home, why did they visit the king of their land to listen to a two minute story? Why are they lizards? Did Steam actually allow a soft core lizard/pedophilia game on its market? I don't know becuase I'm not buying the DLCOverall this game is magnificent.

FF isn't the kind of game you shouldn't touch if you can't allow to enjoy the absurd. The amount of weird actions you can do, that you're at one moment you're in a medieval castle and then at a modern bus station, that you can try to hug just about everyone and every thing all this is apart of it's absurd appeal. Someone put their heart into this and it comes off as completely ludicious. And y'know what, I don't want the creator(s) to change at all. I want that same energy and heart to go into more games like this.I'm not even kidding when I say that the only game I'm looking forward to is FF episode 3.

,Recommended,463110,23779005,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Soggy Toaster,"Farnham Fables is quite honestly one of the goofiest trips I'm glad I decided to take.   Do not get me wrong, this game is uncomfortable, bizzarly sexual at inapropiate times, and (despite its overuse nowadays) the definiton of cringe.  But it is so offbeat, and (what appears to be) unintentionally creepy, that I can't help but reccomend this game, for those of you who play things with ""Irony"".*Without spoiling* what makes this purchase worth it, Farnham Fables starts off with a kid and her aunt going to explore a Castle. But as the kid gets uneasy, she runs off, and randomly bumps into to the king.  The King then tells a story about three princes who saved his life.  Three Princes whose hormones also run through them like 12 year olds on Middle School Prom Night.  I refuse to spoil the rest.I think what made me the most happy was the fact that there is clearly a lot of effort put into this, despite how ""Crude"" it looks (although crude is probably a understatement).  Every action with an object in the environment has its own line of dialogue.  Everything.  I spent a couple of minutes swapping between the princes to search the trash, because each character had something werid to say.  I honestly questioned at times ""was it too much?"".  The answer is probably, but it made it enjoyable.LIGHT SPOILERS (Skip to Conlude if you honestly care)The Cringe Factor, The Creep Factor, the WTF Factor, all derive from the dialogue.  There is some imagery too, but nothing too NSFW.  Just some boobs at some point.  The dialogue, though, has tons of werid sexual comments, from flat out saying the kid at the begining likes naked male models, to explaining that the Prince is only slightly happier about finding a potion *TO SAVE HIS FATHERS LIFE* in comparison seeing a rack on a lizzard.  Another good moment is if you try to wear a skirt you find, in a forest, that also  belongs to a kid.  Literally, you can't do it, but they provide the option just to reveal dialogue that says the sexually scared prince Phillip use to cross dress when he was younger.  Is it too much? For some, oh yeah, but thats what makes it.  Trust me cringe lovers, this is gold.CONCLUDEIf you want to pay $1 to experience a 3MB file that was crafted suprisingly well, with some passionatly drawn MS Paint, thats also short, with crude Point and Click adventure controlls, you could do much worse.  I would argue this is ""The Room"" level of enjoyment, folks. A genuine 10/10."

For 99 cents (and less during sales!) its definitely worth it.Its a short and simple point and click adventure game about a 3 princes and their quest to cure their father. The game can be beaten within half an hour. Its not much, but the writing is surprisingly believable and the characters fleshed out well enough to have very obviously discernable personalities, each with their own likes and dislikes. In that sense, the short time you spend with them is endearing. I hope that a sequel or another chapter or something is made for this. It really was an adorable little tale.Also, there's lizard boobs, but its oddly innocent and is like looking at a National Geographic book. Still, I guess that's nice for those who might be fond of that sort of thing."

Another mention is the villigers that got this game a few negetives, mainly for partical nudity, but I think of it more as a tribal thing, like the real life tribemens of the past, wearing similar clothing. For ones complain about the suggestiveness, don't forget that their other games steam, that take it to much bigger level, hence why this game doesn't have a warning. Though some of the interaction can be questionable with the villigers, I think its suppose to be more friendly than lewd.The puzzles for this episode are the standard 'try this and that puzzles', but do make decent use of the character traits to get around. The music is very basic for this style game, I do wish it was more unique.The world is strange is one, I find it odd for characters to look medieval styled while there a modern locations, like a bus stop, but its not issue that doesn't impact the story.For just $1, I say its was worth the purchase, if you want to relax for a few minutes. I recommend to people, want different with a retro computer style, even though the lizard people were the main point of this story and review, I would definitely play the whole saga, just for the fun of it.And also nice FFIX reference. ;)Now waiting for episode 2."

A child is sick and the king hires a hero to go and find a cure. It's quick, it's straight forward, and it's a decent 20 min experience.Things you might consider before purchasing however are -It does contain nudity, not sexualized but just normal nudity. (A question could be asked WHY it's there as it doesn't add or subtract from the experience in any way).I found one area to be particularly jarring and completely out of place in a world of small thatch villages and king's castles, why does the sword wielding hero get to the exploration site on a bus?I think the best way to summarize my view would be that is seems like a person telling a story rather than a story that flows from a mechanics stand point and the things that made it from a bedtime story to a playable game subtract from the experience as a whole.       Should you buy? ... i liked it's premise so for a dollar yes i would say so."

Like messing with different options to get hilarious dialogue? Like the situational irony of flirting with a mother and then kissing their daughter on the lips in front of her immediately afterwards? Like $0.99 games that are less that 4mb? Have an hour to kill?If you said yes to any of this, then pick this weird gem up. It's quirky, it's unsettlingly kinky, it's funny (mostly because it is unsettlingly kinky), it's dirt cheap, and it's got lots of different and funny dialogue for you to stumble upon. My biggest complaints are as follows: outside of the 'animal people, feral animals, and humans living together' dynamic, the funny dialogue, and the weird-but-fun bits, there's nothing to the game as of right now. The story and lore is more shallow than a puddle. Your cookie-cutter fantasy stereotypes have more plot and personality than this game.

HUGE BONUS POINTS FOR THAT!I checked the website and episode 2 is being worked on. I know i will buy that too when it comes out!my only complaint is even though it supports fullscreen and 2x/stretch visuals. it doesnt display well on my monitor. the 2x is a little too tall and the stretch doesnt seem to like my dual monitor display. (both screens are smaller than 1080 and only one is widescreen) and you cant choose 2x or strech when not in fullscreen. the game would be better if it streched dynamicly with a maximized windowBut because this game features anthromorphic Lizard characters I would say that it is a must have for any Furry gamers. and at $1 there is no reason not to buy it!
