,Not Recommended,463150,28954500,Posted: 2 January,all,SquareWheel,"While I enjoy the aesthetic and style of the game (arcadey/difficult), I found that BARRIER X's gameplay felt more rushed rather than fast-paced.  The goal seems to be to leave you with a sense of panic, as it doesn't take the time to teach you the mechanics as some similar games like Race the Sun do.  Even taking a moment to read the tutorial text will certainly end in your death.Technically the game ran fine, except there's no frame limiter or vsync so the game was also rendering at thousands of frames per second.  Not good news for my GPU.Finally, the game presents an ad at level 2 which feels completely inappropriate for a PC game.  That pushed me over the edge to marking this as a negative review."
76561198105778239,Not Recommended,463150,33615853,Posted: 17 July,all,Aprillomat,"I had fun playing this game. Yet here's a negative review. So why?Let me preface this by saying that i enjoy fast paced, unforgiving reaction games, i have upward of 400 hours in geometry dash and 50 hours in super hexagon, and i also enjoy playing audiosurf. So don't give me ""it's supposed to be hard!"" or ""you are just not good enough"" comments.This game is like the uncared-for child of Audiosurf and Super Hexagon.It's not only unforgiving, it is unfair in a lot of situations. Why? Well, here are some reasons:The obstacles are randomly placed, without any measures taken to prevent placement that is unavoidable or unforeseeable. They are usually spaced apart, so you won't have two obstacles next to each other. But here are some bad things:the obstacles block the view on other obstacles that may be on the next lane right behind them. Even with superb reflexes, you cannot react if you leave a lane, and the new lane greets you with a pillar to your face. The reason why you cannot react is not that you are not good enough, it is...you have a delay when moving, i.e. the animation of you changing lanes must finish before any further inputs are registered. This is irreconcilable with the fact that sometimes, you *need* to move quicker than the game allows you - a complete game breaker.sometimes, due to the randomization, you will switch to one side (let's say left), and then there will be a new obstacle directly behind the first one on the new lane, so you go left, immediate new obstacle, left, new obstacle... but so quickly that you need to *spam* left in order to avoid them all. if during a part like this, you get too far to one side, the game hasn't yet rendered the new lanes on that side (there are technically infinite lanes, but only the few around you get rendered). It may well happen that on such an unrendered lane, an obstacle will appear before you, even tho you couldn't see it coming (because it didn't get drawn quickly enough). The lane also doesn't change color in this case, only once the obstacle is there already, and you will almost inevitably crash.the color of the lanes indicates if an obstacle is coming up, and how far away it is - in theory. If this was done properly, it would alleviate the fact that the pillars will sometimes block your view and you can't see what's coming up; however, the color scheme for indicating this is blue -> bright red -> even brighter red/orange -> obstacle. where blue is safe, and the other two mean danger. well, you can't really tell the difference between those, because while bright red and orange are hard to distinguish this quickly already, the game puts a lot of absurdly needless ""flashy effect lights"" in your face at every minor turn, and there is a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥going on all the time that really does not have anything to do with the gameplay. flashing effects disable you from seeing the red lanes, etc, you get the idea.to make the above worse, in the 4th level, the ground is ALSO red! Like, are you serious?lastly, there's the camera movement. If you are moving towards one side too fast, the camera will sort of follow you with a delay, slightly rotating the screen around its former position in the process, before it settles over you again. This is extremely annoying, and will sometimes make it impossible to see what's on one of the adjacent lanes, because they are too far on the side of the screen and perspectively distorted.other cons include:a game like this should (imho) focus more on the core gameplay mechanic, which by itself is fine and fun (save for the above). However, this game tries to introduce complexity by adding more ""obstacles"", like other players that shoot you (it's almost impossible to see the shots sometimes, due to all the effects), and the ""lane restrictions"", where you can only switch to one side, or need to switch to a specific lane, otherwise your movement gets blocked (you can remove a block by hitting space, but you often don't see the message ""blocked"" because it's so small and there are flashy effects all around it). Looking out for these things makes the game distracting and stressful, rather than fun.Let's say something positve:soundtrack is nicethe pacing is actually nice, and so is the general perspective that you are playing in.the game feels fun, and you could get really absorbed in it, except when you die a lot due to unfair events. Once you get a good RNG on a run, you can kind of enter that ""Zen mode"" you need for these types of reaction games, and everything feels cool for a while (at least until the next time you can't quickly double-tap to switch over 2 lanes because the animation takes so long that your second tap gets ghosted >.<)I think if the devs made the obstacle placement less random, changed the color palette, added an option to remove flashy lights and fixed the delay on the camera and on movement, then this would be a really awesome game. I would love to give this a thumbs up, but in its current state, it just feels too rushed and unoptimised in terms of design choices and core mechanics."

,Not Recommended,463150,27612569,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,xD,"I hear alot of recommendations for this game to be played by a person that enjoyed Super Hexagon, and to those people I would avise you save yourself a couple dollars, or go and buy Race The Sun which is similar but I find more fair.The main concern I have with this game is in the visuals, I believe this is a case where a visual art style has gotten in the way of a functional game. For instance each time the game introduces something new (green strips, blue strips) the focus is taken away from you and onto that line which is exceptionally frustraiting. Similarly, once a 15-second increment is passed your character speeds up, however this is also done in a warp speed kind of fassion which again distracts the player from the obstacles in front of them.Those are the main main reasons why I wouldn't recommend it coming from someone who adored Super Hexagon and decided to check this out on a whim. I hope these were enough to advise you aswell.EDIT 1: I must make it clear that I don't hate the game, I just think they're a better alternatives for someone wishing for a ""Super Fast Avoid'-Em-Up Arcade Game""."
,Not Recommended,463150,29617702,Posted: 31 January,all,VeritasQuo,"I'll update this as I get more time in. If I get more time in.So far, from what I can tell, it's just dumb reflex and eye training. It's flashing lights, speed boosts, disorientation, and frankly wasn't any fun at all to play. When the speed increases visibility drops and if you get stuck in between red lanes you'll just have to wing it, because guess what, your depth perception is useless. This game is not even gratifying like Super Hexagon, where there are patterns to memorize and you get over the disorienation factor steadily as you train your vision. BARRIER X looks like it's lightly based on Super Hexagon in its 60 seconds to beat a level, bright color schemes, and unique visual style, but it falls totally short.The game dropped me in on the first level after the game briefed me and sent me off with a, ""Good Luck"". I crashed in literally a little over a second, and I say to myself, ""Was that designed to impress me, with some ridiculous flashing lights?"" Come on guys.The second level introduces these blue barriers that you have to dodge, apparently in a single defined direction, which might not be terrible if I could actually see the blue barriers before they struck and made me stick. Like I said: depth perception is useless.In short, what little I've played was just not fun. Here's a clip of me not having fun:http://plays.tv/video/58913798ccff0b2232/im-done-with-this-"

,Recommended,463150,28963351,Posted: 2 January,all,Rosaline,"Barrier X is raw arcade twitch at it's very essence. If you are looking for a game to absorb your attention and require you think of nothing but using your skill to win, this game is perfect. Buy this if you live for Super Hexagon or AAAAaaaaaAAAAAaaaaa's frantic dodging.Unlike a number of other cheap avoidance racing games, Barrier X avoids the major pitfalls of the genre. Whilst the learning curve is rough, it's rough in the style of a tough arcade game, not rough in the sense of a bad game. The relative shortness of the levels is made up for by focusing on mastering just a few skills, and the reliance on replay to, as the kids put it, 'git gud'. The obstacles to avoid are big and clear, and the action required to avoid them works consistently. There is adequate forewarning of obstacles, including on the horizon, so planning (albeit autonomous twitch flow planning) is possible. The addition of Blue and Green arrows actually works well, as the recovery mechanic they introduce actually extends your play options.  The soundtrack is minimalist, but works well, and more importantly, it feels appropriately paced for the levels.There are two flaws with Barrier X. The first is an occasional pop-up between runs asking players to check out their next game. Indie devs have it extremely rough, so I can forgive that, especially since it vanished after I clicked on the Call To Action. The second flaw is the shooting the opponent mechanic, which I never quite figured out (beyond occasionally pressing the button).All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, and it has received a significant amount of playtime. If there were more challenges and more background music options, I would easily play it for much longer still."

Took a few hours to figure out what was going on in the game at first and then I started to get it which got me interested since I actually knew what to do. Aswell as the good gameplay goes with its fast paced dodging goes it also has its very fitting soundtack which indeed fits well withing the game and gets you hyped and going for a while until you've listened to all of it, lets be real here it only has 6 tracks, and don't get me wrong it has got its punch and all, and to be honest I do think its enough. So overall I think this game is very promising even though I never got through the first stage but it has got potential, I'm telling you if you love extreme fast paced games."

The game is pretty good, but the adaptation to the peculiarities of some levels was painful enough (I prefer just avoid obstacles like at level 1).Quite an interesting design, making your eyes literally flow out (but you'll figure it out only after you've quit the game) and a wonderful musical accompaniment (in the form of six chiptune tracks), in fact this is all that awaits you here.

At the speed this game is going it is not okay that the camera stays on the lane where you just were and slowly centers itself again. Because of that you sometimes don't see the obstacles early enough, and in a reaction game this fast you must have a clear indicator of what's going on. Additionally at the second level you get lanes where you have to go in a specific direction otherwise you get ""blocked"" , which means that you can't move until you hit Spacebar once, okay so far but the arrow that shows you in which direction you have to move blocks sight on almost the entire lane so the propability is very high that you crash, and because the level structure is pretty random it is entirely possible that you crash immediately into another wall (that you couldn't see), even if you went the way the arrow showed.All together, I think this game is too random and imprecise to be recommended."

But it's not. Things that makes me mark this review as NOT recommend are:1) ""input lag"" (time offset to be correct) to change lanes - game don't allow changing lanes too fast (why?) so if you press button to quick 2 times you may end up changing lane just once. It gets frustrating on faster levels when you need to change lanes in one direction very fast and you actually can't do it if you press too fast.2) Arrows showing where to go on blue blockades actually BLOCKS visibility. If you want to look at oncoming walls to predict where to change lane you can't. Game forces you to look on colors because pooping arrow just covers too much space.3) Enemies are problem. They just add artificial difficulty. You shoot guided missiles at enemy by pressing E. You don't lose anything by pressing E when enemy is not present and actually it helps avoid enemy fire because you will shoot missiles very early when enemy appears. So I personally made habit of tapping E whole game. Next problem with enemies are their aim. Well, this is not surprising that you are one-shot for enemy, but the reaction time that game gives you is just too short to do anything. I think it's around 0.3 - 0.4 sec MAYBE 0.5 second but it's often still too little to make any other move than pressing left or right no matter what is on that lanes. It's indicated by cross appearing on your ship. So, if you are not changing lane constantly you will end up getting shot. Oh, and my favorite are situations when left side is wall, right side is wall, and then mighty cross appears on your ship. Good thing I press E constantly so game is restarted in like second.And then,  when you get somewhat used to changing lanes with input lag, looking on floor not walls and pressing E while dancing here comes4) SLOW DOWNS - like really? If you shoot down enemy or get speed up every 15 sec games slows down for a second. Why is it so bad you may ask? It should help, game is very fast blah blah. Yes, sometimes it helps. Sometimes. But often you are getting ♥♥♥♥ed by it because in games that fast it's muscle memory that makes you complete level. So I get terribly often in situations when I see two walls in front of me and I want to change lane between them. Game slow down but my hand still presses left or right button and yet I see that first wall still hasn't passed because of slow down and I crash in it. It also messes with Q-pressing timing when you want to instantly get unblocked.I really feel bad for this game because it's concept is very good and I still sometimes play it for speed feeling but gets destroyed by details. To make this game fun devs should delete that time offset, move arrows up, give more time to react on enemy aim and delete slow downs. To compensate for difficulty there could be some punishment for pressing E when there is no enemy or Q when non - blocked."

(How many lanes do I have that I can work with? What does the shoot button do? Does shooting cause any harm, given that it appears to make things more orange and less blue?)Any mistake puts you back to square one, and there wasn't any real feeling of progress. That I even got to 55seconds felt like mostly sheer dumb luck, rather than any actual ability on my own part. Plus having the screen do its flickery thing every 15 seconds doesn't help me keep an eye on what's ahead of me either.Barrier˟ is probably a fun game once you get into it. I just hadn't reached that point before I was sick of the thing, and so I can't really recommend this one. (Your mileage may vary.)At time of writing, less than 15% of all players have obtained the achievement for reaching 30 seconds of consecutive play-time on the first level. I can't honestly say that surprises me."

Concept is simple, when lanes you are on are red it telegraphs you will run into a pillar, dodge the pillar and keep going. Track layouts are confusing because of the minimalistic style and I am almost certain that if you - for example - tilt the stick left, your ship will return to the central lane on it's own and you cannot actually remain on that lane which is not immediately obvious. The game unfolds at a rather high speed to begin with, picking up a speed bonus pushes things into nearly unplayable territory - at least in my case. I am playing on a small screen so maybe on very large televisions this game would turn out smoother. Because of the difficulty of handling I cannot recommend this title but I really wish I could as it would be one of the most polished tube-style runners I have played if it were not for those few issues."

Doesn't help when the camera isn't zoomed out for a little bit, which means if you're one of those people who will be frustrated or will rage over dying constantly, please do not waste your time with this. (But on a brighter side note, it has a nice soundtrack.

,Recommended,463150,26331586,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,s4kyle8,"I found this game after playing the demo for the new game this developer is making- STANDBY, and being thuroughly impressed by it.This is a quality game if you're into the endless tough as hell always getting harder genre that was widely popularized by the famous super hexagon. I know the comparison has been made 100 times on steam reviews for this game already, but it is quite similar in theme to super hexagon, so if you're a fan of super hexagon you should probably try this.I actually wasn't really into super hexagon when I played it, and in my opinion this game actually surpasses super hexagon, especially in visuals and learning curve.For the gameplay, you control a little airplane and press arrow keys to instantly switch lanes, similar to audiosurf IIRC. You have to do things like avoid white tiles rushing at you, hit green tiles, and shoot enemies. The gameplay feels quite smooth, and the animations are juicy and responsive so after a bit of playing you kind of feel like you have become the plane. Some elements are slightly frustrating and unintuitive, like there being a delay between switching lanes multiple times which can be problematic when you really need to get to a lane quickly. That said, usually when I die I feel like it's my fault and not the game's, which is a good sign.Visuals wise, this game looks damn nice in my opinion. it's a $3 game and it's well polished, with an electric neon vibe that makes everything in the game stand out. the only minor complaint I have with it is when you reach the levels where there are enemies the enemies can be a tad hard to see, and I sometimes get so busy looking for them that I forget to watch what's in front of me.Curve wise, I think this game does a good job at keeping you at least mildly frustrated most of the time, giving it that sought after tough as nails feel, however unlike super hexagon (for me at least) it also helps you feel like you are always at least getting somewhat better by awarding you new levels that provide extra complications which are more deep than the game simply getting faster. The curve was also gentle enough that someone pretty bad at these types of games like myself actually managed to play for like 40 minutes on end without having to take a break from frustration which certainly didn't happen with super hexagon.Sound wise it's at the very least adequate. I think the music is about on par with that of super hexagon, and the tracks are so similar I wouldn't be surprised if I actually saw some of these tracks in super hexagon. It wasn't too memorable for me personally but it certainly wasn't bad or irritating.Overall, I think this game is a great buy if you're into titles in this vein, and even if not, if its on sale I might reccomend picking it up anyway because I'm not into this genre either and I still had some fun with it and I expect to come back to it again in the future."

Which by the way come at the worst possible time. No one will be enticed to play your next game after they die frustrated then are forced to see your add instead of jumping back into the game. Maybe use a billboard next time around?The feel of the game is right on. The sound effects are just about perfect.

Got the game for 59 cents and I believe its worth the normal $3 price for  the levels, the depth towards beating each level (60 seconds), and for trying to beat high scores if you feel the need to. I also enjoyed the messages after/before each level, they were short, sweet, and they motivated me keep at it regardless of how many times I failed.  The game also runs very well (at least for me it did).  It took me 2.2 hours to get 30 seconds in each level.  No real issues with the game besides the first track ending in a loud buzzing way that messed with my concentration a few times although luckily you can simply choose a different song.Edit: ...and it took me 3.4 more hours to get 60 seconds in each level, results may vary.Great and an INSANELY fast/difficult avoid-em-up.

It is a very good time killer, because of that urge to beat all of the levels or even beat your friend's best time on the hardest level. The Gameplay is a set of 7 levels, progressively introducing new mechanics snd getting increasingly difficult as they go, and are very well structured and organized. I will say, that this game could be VERY diffcult for someone with mediocre reaction time and observational skills to pick up and play, because of how fast paced it is and the fact that there is so much to keep in check at once. This could also be considered a good thing, however, as this game could serve to enhance ones reaction time or multi tasking skills.In Conclusion, it is a very simplistic game that provides a challenge and some personal gain if you're up for it.I would Highly reccomend this game, even further so if it is on sale. 9/10"

Sounds simple enough. However, at fifteen second intervals, the game speeds up. And it will continue to until you either reach the end of the level, or you die. The latter result will happen much more often then the former unless you have incredible reflexes. While the gameplay moves way too fast for me, the performance was smooth and I didn't find any bugs or glitches in my brief playthrough. In short, a low cost (and well made) Unity game that gave me a nasty migraine after twenty minutes of playing it.
