Then you've basically seen and experienced the entire game without having to drop a cent. It's alright for 5-10 mins of playtime and does scale up to a bit of a challenge, but it's another repetitive flash game at heart that can't sustain your interest for too long. You'll spend longer farming the steam cards than you will playing the game.I didn't come across any technical bugs or crashes so credit to the developer on that front. If you pick it up on heavy discount you should break even/profit once you sell the cards, so that's another plus. Overall it's not an atrocious game, it's just ""meh""."

Along the way you can pick up health and cash, and drive cars you come across. The cars mow down enemies while protecting you. At the end of every level, you can use the experience points you earn to upgrade a selected skill of your choice: e.g. faster shooting, increased health, etc. You also get a better weapon after defeating each level's boss.Good- Loads fast- Objectives are clear & easy to understand- Directions given on game map- Bonus item drops are well-regulated- More than one killing mode (guns, cars, etc)- Well-tapered level progression- Enabling skill selection allows for varied gameplay- The graphic style worksBad- Controls take some getting used to: I would have preferred 100% keyboard instead of keyboard + mouse- Movement when in cars is counter-intuitiveConclusionAn acceptable buy at its current price point of $1. I got this at a 90% discount so no complaints. It runs well, provides decent enough entertainment for a bit, and even has trading cards."

Thanks to developer Andrew Jr. and State of Anarchy, we now know what happens when they graduate. Playing something like a simplified take on the original Grand Theft Auto, this hand-drawn crime spree is basically the natural evolution of those same murderous stick figures, brought to life with minimal effort and maximum mayhem.State of Anarchy doesn’t waste much time with the likes of story, throwing players straightaway into a violent world where everyone’s out to kill. The gameplay is rudimentary, yet relatively effective for what it sets out to do. Players will guide their bullet-spraying protagonist across the ballpoint-pen landscapes, racking up the body count on their way to complete each stage by taking out the heavy-gunning boss waiting inside a fortified position within a bank.State of Anarchy BankIt’s tough for me to really judge State of Anarchy because, while it seems pretty crude and simplistic, it embraces this existence well. There’s no pretense of being anything more than a violent top-down killing spree, and the visual style goes well with the vocal sound effects that accompany it. This isn’t a game that’s trying to be anything more than it is, nor one that feels like it needs to. It is, simply put, a no-frills action title that sees no need to dress itself up in anything fancier.Despite how well it pulls off the simple approach, State of Anarchy isn’t without some flaws. While your character can level up and obtain new weapons, there’s a strange linear take on the whole thing. Players have no option to use the weapons previously obtained, with each new one replacing the last. New guns are unlocked by defeating each ‘boss’, a repeated identical fight taking place in the center of a very large and densely-populated bank. This repetition begins to grow stale pretty early on, but there’s nothing demanding that players tackle each new stage in any particular timeframe.In addition to unlocking new weapons, clearing each stage in State of Anarchy also allows players to spend any talent points they’ve earned by leveling up since the last one. Players can spend each point on increased health, running speed, fire rate, or health regeneration. For me, the obvious choice was to go hard on regeneration, but with lengthy healing time hard to find among the swarms of increasingly-powerful enemies, others may find that this is not the best path.PROS:Quick, fast-paced action.Level up and talent system.No false pretenses.CONS:Repetitive play.Lack of distinguishing features."
76561198140299850,Recommended,463210,28765656,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,foofaraw,"State of Anarchy is such great fun! Regretably I won't be writing a long review, and it isn't because this isn't a great game with tremendous potential. Rather, it's because I have a bum left hand, and if there was ever a two-handed game, this is it. (Still, I got well into the 4th level.)You find yourself in a crudely hand-drawn landscape with some very upbeat, catchy music playing. It's a semi-urban setting, such as the suburbs, or a small town (but each playthrough varies in objectives.) Your task is to RUN LIKE HELL, as you're attacked from all sides by armed assailants (as you yourself are one.) You're given an idea of the direction by a big red arrow (just like IRL!) As you kill, your victims drop currency, and occasionally first-aid kits. All you have to do to collect is run over them, as you aim and fire with your mouse.Oh wait, I almost forget. In State of Anarchy, cars HURT! BUt they can also be driven, simply by pressing the spacebar while in the vicinity. (But they are maddingly frustrating, AND funny, to drive!) But while a car will (sort of) get you where you wish to go, so may they eventually leave you high and dry from acccumulated damage. But the beuatiful explosions when you destroy one you're NOT in is a worthwhile tradeoff. (Oh.....watch out for the running bomb-carriers. They also blow up nicely when shot....preferebly from a distance.)Each cross-town battle ends up in a large open building, like a dining hall. (Perhaps they are something more specific, but it's a bit too fast-paced to notice all the details.) The goal of each level is to make one's way to the boss in their own room in the middle of this hall, and blast him to death. In the process you gain a level, and a shiny new weapon. (As well as one point toward a character attribute.)By NO MEANS is the art style of State of Anarchy a negative. It adds to the addictive, fun nature of the game, and helps keep enjoyment and humor at a high level in what can be quite a hard game. (I only played the easier level, and considering my issues, that was quite enough, thankyouverymuch! I obtained SOA on sale for 49 CENTS, but would not hesitate to say that this game would be worthwhile even at regular price."
,Recommended,463210,25703886,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,WidescreenRules,"Take this game for what it is: short, stupid, silly fun. I'd love to see how it operates as a twin-stick shooter, but apparently it's restricted to keyboard and mouse. Still, this is no Hotline Miami nor is it meant to be. Everything has that marker-to-paper look to it; the silly, human-made ""sound effects"" fit the mood perfectly, and the music is perfect for the type of game that this is. It starts off pretty easy and does indeed get progressively harder, but as you go along you can upgrade your health, recharge rate, firing rate, or speed to suit your gameplay style.Overall, I'd say that you're not going to sit at this for hours; but when you have five or ten minutes to kill (no pun intended), this game is silly and quick enough that it's good for wasting some time, possibly with a smile on your face."

The game have a normal and hardcore difficulty settings and a multi-leveled progression system. Here, the goal is killing everything and anything that moves. Nice 2D indie game.Gameplay.The game consists of attacking banks to kill the bad guy inside and get upgrades for the character and the weapon. Basically, you arrive to bank, kill bad guy inside, pickup his gun (which is better than yours), receives a small improvement, run away, picks a car and return to another bank to repeat this once again under more difficult circumstances.As the game progresses, stronger enemies appear, and you have to do the same thing over and over. The engines and the mechanics are alright, the enemies move well and they tend to come from many sides to you (they never stops spawning). In the map atmosphere you'll find everything that a normal city has, alike: buildings, streets, cars and nature objects.The game is available in English. Controls are simple. The player navigates on foot with the WASD and fires their weapon with the mouse.The gameplay is good but becomes a little repetitive. No is that game to play every day and i probably won't come back to this game often but I had fun playing it. The graphics are simple, two-dimensional and they look attractive. Soundtrack is really good. In summary, it’s a pretty action-indie with a good quality-price ratio as well as alevel-based game.Positive points. (+)Cheap.Appealing 2D graphics.Easy and relatively challenging gameplay.Pretty nice level-based gameplay.Controls are simple (based on WASD and mouse).High amount of enemies and cars.40 open-world levels to explore (20 normal ones, 20 hardcore ones).The ability to load levels in normal mode.

Honestly, with the cartooning and simple graphics ( being top down) with a upbeat loop music of reggae beats, you rob banks and create, well anarchy. The story line seems to be just a guy wakes up some morning and with nothing to lose, goes on a bank robbing spree.... With  a W,A,S,D , space bar and mouse controls to just move and shoot, (with getting into cars with space bar) its easy to pick up and cause, well anarchy. I personnaly like that the sound effects are all human made mouth noises. It's funny and adds charm to shoot a gun and you can imagine the guy going ''  patwoo, patwoo. patwoo '' every time you fire the rocket launcher. There is a normal and hardcore mode to go through 25 bank robberies levels. Each level you get a diffrent gun to implement/use and kill the boss in the bank to well cause, anarchy.  You also level up and get to choose  outta of 4 improvements along with your new weapons. Life, life regen, movement, and shooting speed.  Its simple and crude with doodle-ing at its best. It's a good one to let your inner psycho child go with."

You have this repetitve gameplay with nothing to work with (at least, nothing that I've noticed in 1 hour of gameplay). No co-op, no multiplayer, no competitve environment.Yes, this game has more or less polished core gameplay -- I didn't encounter any bugs, except weird AI pathing. But I don't think I'll return to this game after I'll mine the cards out of it.Granted, the game's really cheap. But it currently has a quality of a free flash game from a site like Newgrounds or something similar.And the saddest part is, devs are asking players to fund their game on IndieGoGo, in order to make new features -- I mean, come on, you've made this game in a timespan of less than a month, or possibly even less, juding by the amount of content in it -- it might've been made during a game jam or a hackathon of some sorts.Would I recommend it to anyone?

Very fast-paced gameplay behaving like a top down bullet hell shooter. Your goal is simple. Make your way between banks in a city and fight a boss inside each one. Each boss uses a different weapon, and after each bank you clear, the number of enemies on the streets and their difficulty increases. There are several weapons you get to use, drive cars, and even level up and improve some of your stats.The art style is simplistic, but very charming. It looks like scribbled drawings of a small kid, which is a nice and unique style I've not seen before. To complement that, one of my favourite things about the game is how all the sound effects in it seem to be done with voices. The music is pretty nice and light-hearted too.The game can get a tad repetitive, so it's mostly fun in short bursts, but considering the mechanics and the aesthetics are executed nicely and the game is very cheap, I can definitely recommend it."

Even at it's low price, the game still feels like it costs too much for what you are getting in return. As mentioned above, this game has very binary and tedious gameplay. It doesn't feel like you do anything or progress for the most part. All this game is, is just about slowly running towards your next building made of something, and then killing the same guy over and over again, just with a slightly different weapon each time. While also shooting the same enemies attacking you on your way. There is also nothing special about the artstyle or any visual aspects of this game. It feels very simple and binary to me.

I've got a pretty outdated computer, but even this lagged on stage 10. My computer can't handle ten cars on my screen, which it should. After a certain point of cars, it gets obnoxious, not just from the lag, but from how much they pin you down. Which happens  every single time I'm driving to the next bank. Then the game proceeds to spawn in ten kamikazi's and said to me ""This car is too nice for you! You're going to walk to the bank! Which is completely fine, untill they send in ten car's, just as a nice lag spike. All in all, if you have an outdated computer, as in Pentium 4 3.20 GHz single core, 630 GT, and 4 GB of RAM. Just know that you're only getting less than an hour of gameplay."

,Not Recommended,463210,32565628,Posted: 19 June,all,yelyah,"It was quite exciting to play at first. The premise is simple. Kill people, increase the body count, raise the level of anarchy and level up. Leveling up grants to skills that you can learn. You have directions to a bank constantly. When you clear the bank, there is a boss that drops a new weapon upgrade when defeated. All in all, it is a pretty well made game but it just gets so repetitive and boring. If you really want to kill time, go ahead and play but it's really the same thing over and over. There is no incentive for me to keep playing and leveling up so I probably won't touch this game again for some time."

,Recommended,463210,33964654,Posted: 1 August,all,Ruby (Сяош),"A decent game. It's bad animated cartoony style makes it a bit more interesting to run around and kill people. Though this game can get a bit repetitive, it's a great game to play when you're bored, playing to pass the time, before work/school, etc. It has 30 stages, progressivly getting harder, with more enemies and more variations of enemy's. Every boss has a better weapon than the last, when you kill the boss It gives you a new weapon (or an upgrade). So far I mostly like the game but, the things I dont like about this game is.It can get repetitiveNot that longThere isnt different areas to fight bossesNot many weapons to unlock"
