The controls are mostly nice, although the fact that you always jump to the maximum height is a bit annoying, especially when you have to kill airborne enemies. Sadly this game is just too short."
76561198022348689,Not Recommended,463220,22918949,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,MrSpock,"I spent a little time with this game, and I can't say that it was terrible, but it's not a game that I would recommend, unless you literally only have a dollar to spend on a game, or if you've exhasted every other Metroidvania there is out there.  It's a serviceable Metroidvania with a jump-and-shoot mechanic that is reminscent of Mega Man in that you can only have 3 shots on screen at a time.  There are several design decisions I'm not a fan of.  The enemies feel like bullet sponges.  The music restarts everytime you die, and you can die a lot.  Jump is initially mapped to the up arrow (which thankfully can be changed) but prompts still exist in the game that ask you to press up that no longer work, despite being specifically prompted (though the new jump button works).  When you unlock the power dash, you're told to double tap left or right, which doesn't work anywhere near as reliably as I'd like.  If you decided to check the control screen, you'll find this is also mapped to the shift key.  Why the game didn't direct you to this much easier alternative, I have no clue.  The one boss I fought did not feel terribly inspired, it just moved in a giant circle around the room, shooting discs at you.All that said, I wouldn't call it a terrible game, it's just that there are many other titles out there that should be able to scratch this itch, if you're so inclined."
,Not Recommended,463220,31860509,Posted: 20 May,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"After 30 minutes intoZolthan, I'm throwing in the towel.I get it, it's a standard ho-hum MetroidVania. In fact, it'stoostandard for it's own good. Everything about this title is 'meh', with a price tag to reflect that. I'm not complaining about the small asking price - I'm more concerned with friends wasting precious gaming time on lackluster titles.Look, I just came from playingHollow KnightandDead Cells. I understand they are like 15X more expensive - but trust me when I say that they are probably magnitudes of order more fun and satisfying.You can do better.I really don't have any 'Pros' forZolthan. What were the problems?-Music is grating-Controller support is very poor; rebinding is wonky and after tinkering with it three times, it still didn't feel right-Nothing is original, and it is small in scope for a MetroidVania-Graphics are basically 'programmer'/place holder art-The platforming doesn't particularly feel greatIf this was someone's first fully-fledged project, then congratulations on finishing a major accomplishment.I mean that. In fact, I won't even refund. BUT I would never recommend that my Steam friends spend their valuable gaming time and money on substandard titles when there are soooo many other far superior games to check out.Peace,"
,Recommended,463220,23624682,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,AllTracTurbo,"I just completed this game and would like to address a couple things that I read in the negative reviews.A lot of the negative reviews mentioned that the game did not have controller support and they felt the controls were bad because you could not disable the double click to dash and they would often inadvertently activate it killing themselves. Both of these issues have been fixed. There is now controller support and you can bind the dash to a separate key with the option of turning double click to dash on or off. Other than that, I played with the keyboard and felt that the controls were very responsive and I had no problems.I'm not sure why people are saying this is a very difficult rage game. I did not find it that difficult at all and completed it without many deaths. There is no permanent death and the game gives you very frequent checkpoints which you instantly respawn at when you die. Most of the reviewers saying that this game was difficult have probably never played an NES game or have forgotten what they were like. Everything in this game is designed very simple and follows a pattern. If you take a few seconds to understand how a mechanic works instead of just trying to run through the game blindly respawning every 5 seconds when you die, it will become quite easy.The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that it is short. I took my time exploring everything I could and even backtracked through most of the game to make sure I didn't miss anything after getting an upgrade that would allow me to reach new areas and it still only took me 64 minutes to complete the entire game.I feel that the current price of 99 cents is exactly where this game should be priced, it's like spending a few quarters on an arcade machine. I would recommend it to anyone that thinks they would be interested in this type of game knowing that it is very basic and is only an hour long."
,Recommended,463220,24267234,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Shrodu,"So, I got a few bundles ofNew Realitygames that were mostly garbage to be tossed in the trash.  After digging through some bad titles, my eyes were set onDungeon of Zolthan.  Immediately, I get a nostalgic Atari-age feel from the title, the graphics, and the gameplay.  So, when I booted it up, I had to know if the retro urge would be satisfied.  I was pleasantly impressed by the end result.Dungeon of Zolthanis a short Metroidvania that includes 4 bosses and can be speedrun in about 20 minutes (my best time is about 16 minutes).  You don't get a story.  You don't get a tutorial.  Instead, you get a simple plug-and-play game that essentially teaches you through an ""Instinctive"" tutorial you get from games likeMetroidorMegaman Xhad (if you've seen Egoraptor'sSequelitis, then we're basically on the same page).  You run, you jump, you shoot, you dash.I LOVE the neon look the developer was going for and I LOVE how true it stays to the retro conventions.  It really reminds me of Atari-age and NES-age games.  Back when games ranged from reasonably hard to Konami hard.  Though this game did have some rage-moments (mostly speedruns, few deaths, and perfect boss runs), but after a while, it's all manageable.I also love the retro music, especially for the final boss himself.  In the end, I had a great experience from this title.  Is it worth the price?   Possibly so, but you still can't beat finding a good discount.  Suggested price range between 50-75 cents.8/10  A great retro experience for the retro player."

I guess one of the things I liked the least about this game is the soundtrack. It's like a 3 minute song that is so repetative that it started making me angry. But overall the game is good.

You cannot deactivate the double tap dash, which will occur frequently and always lead to certain death.- This game is incompatible with JoyToKey and there is no controller support whatsoever.- Level design is pretty dull.- Boss battles are uncreative.If you can live with those flaws, I guess you can buy the game.

,Recommended,463220,24155352,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,Protoss,"What is Dungeon of Zolthan?Dungeon of Zolthan is a small Metroidvania game.GameplayThe game is controlled exclusively with the keyboard, there is no controller support. You use the WASD keys to walk around, Shift to dash and Space to shoot. You start off with just a basic weapon and jump, but can gain a higher jump, double jump, dash, rapid fire and eventually invinicibility while dashing. You have three hearts, and while basic enemies and traps take away one heart, mines and advanced enemies take away two hearts. Spike blocks instakill you, regardless of your hearts.You can find up to four additional hearts, when finding one your life is fully restored. Most upgrades are gotten after boss fights, the hearts are completely optional after rooms with minor challenges.The game is difficult at first but once you figured out how to correctly do even the more difficult passages, you can do that every time, kind of like in Super Meat Boy.The few bosses are also niciely designed, and while they might not be completely original, at least each boss is unique and needs a different strategy to beat, without ever becoming overly difficult. In fact, experienced players will find the whole game and especially the bosses too easy.The play time is short. I needed under 40 minutes on my first playthrough, but I skipped all optional upgrades by accident or rather luck.GraphicsThe graphics are very basic, the game looks like an 80s game, but plays fluid most of the time. The screenshots on the store page show how the game really looks like.SoundThe sound is basic, although every action has a sound, but the background music is nicely done. Overall I can't complain as it fits with the chiptune character the overall style of the game.As I said, the game is short, and in fact there is even an achievement for beating it in under 20 minutes. Getting all achievements took me around two to two and a half hours, but can probably be done faster by better players.Recommended: If you know what you get, yes!Seeing that the game is a budget title going for a base price of a single Euro, this Euro is an appropriate price. The game is small, very linear, but a nice experience while it lasts. No complaints for this price. Appropriately, this review is also short."

I can't say that it is great by any stretch, but the price is right and I enjoy the retro graphics that aren't an attempt to feel 8-bit while using a 32 bit color scheme.Most of the difficulty comes from the fact that the very simple gameplay requires very exact input, and there are a few oddities there related to interactions with walls.  Otherwise, the game works well with my conroller and I have no complaints.The music is repetative, but for the kind of game this is I don't think anyone should be expecting an orchestra.  It's an homage to platformers of the past with a little bit of Atari thrown in for good measure."

It's not a bad game, it certainly stands above others that are less inspired, or more poorly done. But the problem I have is that bad games make poor design choices, and this game just doesn't really make any design choices. I imagine it's supposed to be a fun shooter, supposedly a Metroidvania, but it hardly beats out an old MegaMan. I think to make a good game you have to either aspire to be like or better than something, or be very inspired to do your own thing. I don't think this is fun, though. I find it to be a mediocre attempt at something better than itself."

Still, the gameplay is reminiscent of Mega Man, the soundtrack (Although its just the one song) is phenomenal, and the graphics rival that of *INSERT TRIPLE A TITLE HERE*. Even if you're not a fan of this type of game, I highly recommend it and hope to see a good community built around this masterpiece.Cheers.~Fibcoa7"

No reason to not play this game now.  Buy it.  Play it.  Love it.-end of edit #2-Great game.  Obviously reminiscent of Megaman.  Music is great.  Love collecting upgrades and exploring.GET RID OF DOUBLE TAP DASH YOU CLOWNS!!Reasons:1.  Whoever actually uses double tap dash instead of the designated dash button in ANY game that has such is a moron.2.  Maybe my fingers move quicker than the average person, however, when I want to make a very small movement so I can better time my next jump over the wall of spikes that will obviously kill me I DONT WANT TO ♥♥♥♥ING DASH INTO THE SPIKES AND DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH.3.  When I want to turn quickly and fire a few shots mid jump, I would like to just turn quickly and fire a few shots mid jump, NOT DASH INTO THE ♥♥♥♥ING BOSS AND DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH.Anyway.  Anyone who loves the Megaman series or even castlevania, or metroid, or all the other great side scrolling shooters, play this game without a doubt for sure.P.S. Get rid of double tap dash or at least give me an option to turn it off in the menu.  Gosh...EDIT:  I wanted to come back after reading other peoples reviews of this game.  We all seem to have the same gripe with the double tap dash, however, MMX is the same way its just that the SNES controller is superior to any peripheral for PC so its not as big of a deal.  I don't think, though, that its a bad game because of that.  it might make it a bit more challenging and forces you to be careful, but hey, one of the achievements is literally called ""Be Careful.""Don't say the game is bad and you wouldn't recommend it JUST because you died a lot.  Sorry it doesn't hold your hand and give you soft cushy edges so the spikes don't kill you.TLDR; Buy this game and then play this game."
,Not Recommended,463220,34262017,Posted: 15 August,all,Melwen,"Simple metroidvania with ugly graphics and a difficulty which will lead you to rage.Main character (box?) is not only simple, but expressionless. It's number of animations is very low.You get hearts for increasing your health, but then most of the common enemies hurt you for two hearts. This nullifies the sense of doubling your health.One of the bosses pattern consists on increasing its speed as its life goes down. The problem is that it also jumps when it is near you. Combine this two things and you will have to position yourself in order to provoke the boss jump in places where it can be dodged. The game tricks you into believing that the corners are this place, but this place is relative to you. This pattern is very counterintuitive.Other bosses have extreme difficulty, such as the wall of eyes. Funnily enough, Zolthan is the easiest of them all.Given the very specific movements the game expects from you, save points should actually not exist, respawning the player at the entrance of each screen.Music becomes repetitive as it is only a single melody.Overall, it's a short game whose problem is an excess of difficulty. Probably not worth your time if you have some others games from the same genre."

It's been a long time since I've played a game where I keep dying but have the drive to keep playing.

Xbox360 pad had to be manually configured. Audiovisual style left me unimpressed. Art direction and foe design are next to non-existant. Level design is flawed, offering fake multiple paths that you cannot take until you get unlock something down another path first and is disguised linearity. Foes are often on different z level than you and the inability to aim and the necessity to shoot everything 3 times mean you stop the action and jump on the same spot spamming the fire button way too often. Removed for declutter."
,Recommended,463220,22931080,"Posted: 12 May, 2016",all,Orisno,"While it has its flaws (LET US TURN OFF DOUBLE TAP TO DASH SO I CAN STOP DYING AGAINST MY WILL) Dungeon of Zolthan is a great Metroidvania-lite style game that takes around an hour to complete. While the bosses are a bit uncreative, the enemies fits the feel of the game well. You can aquire various powers that are hardly ever useful, but all are conveinent (for example, rapid fire allows you to have more than three bullets on the screen at once, which while unnecessary, is quicker).My greatest qualm is the world design. The entire dungeon is pretty steamlined, which gives a false sense of exploration. There is hardly ever more than one path you can take, and even when you can, you find a few rooms and then maybe an extra heart power. I would love to see the dungeon expanded upon so that multiple branching routes exist.I'd give it a 7/10, would recommend, and at a dollar, highly recommend it. You'll get an hour of entertainment if you only play through once, which is much better than most other things you can buy with a dollar."

Most importantly it does what old school games used to do right- it introduces a new mechanic then gives the player a challenge to overcome using that mechanic, then finally a boss battle where the player needs to use it in order to progress.With all that in mind, it's one of the better games around this price mark and I can think of a lot worse ways to spend an hour. Don't expect much more than a short, basic platformer and you'll do fine."
