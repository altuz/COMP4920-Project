She will read your horoscope or your tarot. You can also play some traditional board games with her. It is a relaxing and meditative experience. You won't put many hours into it, but you may come back to it from time to time for a bit of spiritual guidance."

It is a short experience but quite well done, it is definitely on the list that I would show to people who wanted to see VR. It takes advantage of the medium really quite well. The only thing I would change is what is outside the cart windows everything else is so beautiful it seems out of place."

I hold a similar opinion about tarot as expressed in this thread :http://steamcommunity.com/app/463290/discussions/0/364040797995587848/. I play Kismet on a Vive.I enjoyed Kismet. It is a quirky experience with some awesome arts, great voice acting and tons of character.Sadly the AI is pretty bad at the dice game (won on my first attempt, and despite Kismet's opinion, she wasn't even close.).Additionally, the experience is slightly sub-par on the Vive, as there are practically no interactive elements. I want to pet the cat, I want to be able to manipulate stuff in Kismet's cabin. That's why the Vive comes with the wands! There is none of that, as the game seems to have been aimed primarily at Oculus Rift owners. That's too bad, as the wonderfully detailled environment really scream to be interacted with.That being said, it is definitely worth buying (and not asking a refund just because it is more of a one-shot experience! Devs need to eat too, and there is obviously a *lot* of work that went into making Kismet), and if just to give your hippy neighbour who hates shooting robots something she will be entranced with in VR :)tl;dr : could be at a slightly lower price point for the Vive, as it doesn't take advantage of the wands at all, but overall a good buy!"

I have no interest in astrology but this little game has just jumped to the top of my list of games/experiences that I use to show off VR to my friends.

,Recommended,463290,23969677,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,jfalcon,"I purchased Kismet based on a few criteria: a) the fact that I had not yet made room for full room-scale experience and the game offered a seated experience; b) it has an excellent price point; and c) I am a fan of card-reading and Tarot.When the game begins, you're seated at a table inside what appears to be a ""gypsy trailer"", its interior extremely ornate and attention to detail basically everywhere you look.  I enjoyed looking around at all the various objects (I don't recall finding any I could pick up or move), including the cat sleeping up on the bench.I have only tried two of the three experiences, mainly the game you play against the fortune teller which reminded me of a twist on ""backgammon"".  For that, you're whisked away to a ""desert-like"" scene.  The backgrounds for this game are beautiful and it's just a joy to take in the scenery.What I found really mind-blowing was the 3D animation and effects on various cards during the Tarot reading.  Even more so when you pick up and examine the cards afterward.  Simply an awesome effect and the developer was kind enough to share how they did this on their blog.This is definitely a game to get if you want to show off your HMD to your friends and family."

The reading in Kismet is very simple, but sufficient to create a compelling picture, and it works for what it sets out to accomplish.It's also one of the more polished and charming titles I've picked up for the VIVE (and I have most of what's available). The character of Kismet is likable, the games are simple and fun, the music is great, and the inside of her little home has a lot of really nice details.I'd love more content and interactivity, but what you get is made well, and if you think you're likely to have your cards read now and then, it's probably not a bad purchase!"
