,Recommended,463850,25347978,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,[ARX]AnthonyPS,"IntroductionMuddy Heights 2, without question, has attracted a lot of 'meme reviews', short-negative/positive-only reviews, and joke reviews. So I'll write a serious one to help out people who are currently considering to purchase this game.Muddy Heights 2 is a short 'mini game' where you get to defecate from a rooftop and control your feces around with W/A/S/D/Spacebar. The main goal of the game is just to hit as many people as you can with your feces. You can either directly hit a person in the face or you can leave a slippery trail to tumble them down when they run over it. The more people fell down (or fainted?) caused by your feces, the more points you get. The more goals you achieve, the 'better' your feces will be (e.g. double jump, larger splatter, 'explosive' mode, etc)ReviewThe gameplay is very short - you'll get three levels to complete and that's it. For each level, you have certain goals you have to achieve in order to unlock the next level. Each level offers different possible humorous interactions with the environment - called 'secrets'. They will give you a word or a phrase as a clue and you'll have to find out that interaction by yourself. For example,you can derail the roller coaster and destroy the ferris wheel with itin the Theme Park level. The entire gameplay hours really depends on how smart you are on finding out those 'secrets' - if you're the type of person that always go after the 100% achievement. If you don't bother finding out all the secrets, you'll obviously finish and get bored of this game much quicker than what it has to offer.Graphics are low-quality but very funny to see. The panic expression face are hilarious and the terrible animations made it funnier. Some of the interactions can be considered as a - excuse my language - 'WTF moment' and it's really worth it to find them.As a humor-based game, this game has attracted a lot of gaming YouTuber to try them out - like PewDiePie, JackSepticEye, and Markiplier. I do not recommend you to watch their gameplay before purchasing this game. Spoilers will kill the 'WTF just happened' moments when you play the game. As Muddy Heights 2 is a short game, I personally do not want to miss out the initial natural reaction when I play the game.ConclusionOverall, it really depends on you whether this game is worth it or not. I saw a lot of negative reviews saying that this game isn't worth the price - so I took conclusion that not everyone enjoys these kind of games and not everyone find defecating from a rooftop as 'funny'. I personally think this game is worth the price. Even though the gameplay is very short, it gave me good tearful laughs and I enjoy the experience much better rather than watching others play it on YouTube.As a gamer from an undeveloped country, I understand that not everyone can easily spend any money (even a dollar) on video games. If you do find it's not worth it to purchase Muddy Heights 2 - I highly recommend you to watch the gameplay from YouTube. Everyone deserves a good laugh - maybe Muddy Heights 2's gameplay can make your day.That's all I have to say about Muddy Heights 2. I hope my review can be useful to you. Thank you for reading!"
