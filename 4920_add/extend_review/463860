Atmosphere and crafting is very well done and the graphics are addictive. Kurgansk is often compared to Borderlands but it has its own style and I like it even better.But gameplay is a mess. At first graphics and atmosphere compensates for this but after a while the game gets boring, repetitive and frustrating. First of all it´s not ""a huge world to explore"", in reality it is small. I stopped playing survival mode because after 20 days I have seen and done everything.Storymode is a full-fledged desaster. You´re supposed to play a copter pilot but gameplay feels like you are a three-year old suffering from wasting desease. You starve in less than two hours, drop from exhaustion after running 200 m and without shelter you will♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants. And there is radiation poisoning, too...Your stats are deteriorating so rapidly that you either get your quests done and continually  die from starvation/radiation or you constantly scavenge and build shelters and get nothing else done.Combat is stupid and nonsensical. At first you can kill your enemies with one well-placed hit but they get stronger every day. Sooner or later they become invincible. In storymode I´m day 50, Although my stats are maxed and I´m armed for bear I had to stop playing. As soon as I materialize I´m killed by a bunch of invulnerable teleporting ""demons""."

Steam do need to get a grip on quality control though.OK, lookign at other forum posts i read that this is also under another game title called the Abandoned and runs on Mobile/Android phones for 2 Euro.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_fn6ji03u8on steam for 5x that price and 2.5x with this so called sale. Cut n run tactic by dev's here.Glad i checked these forum discussions and thx for the warning, think i will 100% remove from my list now.Thats a real bummer, i was looking forward to it with 50 % discount it would be good enough to buy it, but if devs abandoned game then well whats the point to support them.By the way, what kinda of bugs does this game have? are there critical ones?I got it from a coupon offered from making badges. Valve is in on the scam. I played it for several hours. It's a pestering walking sym where you die every day and start over. You can't clear a safe area to take the time to figure anything out without dying of something. You will die of starvation with a full pack of food after eating 10 seconds earlier randomly out of the blue. You do advance and wake up with that full pack of food but the dying constantly gets repeditive quickly. Then having to restock your food because you died and ate it all because you took the time to get back to your house to make more food just to die again in the next minute. Definitly not worth looking at if it has no support to even out the game play."

,Not Recommended,463860,29435195,Posted: 22 January,all,MYSCHUFF,First impressions are not great. You can't put things down without distroying them WHY? You have to put down nearly your entire inventory  to pick up a log. Where is the inventory weight calulator if it's so damd importiant? Where is the mesurment of what things weight if it's so importiant. Distroying what you collected is just really dumb. Meaning you can only have access to materials for a fire that you can hold. you can't go collect so you can get other things done. If this is played by a narrow path they sure didn't give an clues. why is the inventory not even hinted at? The B is crafting i thought the whole time it was the inventory. why does everything have a disription exccept what the hud means. What are the icons and what do they mean? someones put some effort in to this but left no clue as to what things mean. why i need 8 different fire making compnents that clog up the limitd bag space? This better not be a waste your time on fiddly crap so you never get anything done game.I'll try again later and see if it gets any better. It may get a yes if it expains itself as i play it.

I think to myself looking around seeing only a nearby statue. Huh, must be nothing. Back to gathering when suddenly, there's the noise again! I look around, the statue is....closer? Is it? Hard to tell. I dismiss it. I hear the noise again and look around. Oh crap, it's definitely the statue. SUDDENLY I get attacked from the other direction, so I turn to face my assailant only to be instantly murdered from behind by the statue.This game has weeping angels, 10/10Okay so now I'm a lot further in I will provide some actual details. The game has the beginnings of 2 story mode maps, one has different mechanics and enemies to the other one, it has a straight up survival mode and an adventure mode where you have to complete quests and stuff.It's a good start but it clearly needs biggers maps, the story mode needs fleshing out some more and really it needs more stuff to craft and some more explanations about the anomalies and stuff because really at this point I just walked in to them to figure out what they'd do.That being said this is a very early version and going off what is already there I'd say the game has a lot of potential. So if you don't buy it at least keep an eye on it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTqf-2ZuOJA&ab_channel=Belvie"

For the first 5 days or so they are at the right level of diffiucty. Then all of the sudden they get terible, its to the point where they kill you in two hits ad it takes three to kill them but they hit faster then the player. I have tested this even with the best armor and melee wepons and firearms they can one hit kill you by day 30. You may think thats along way away bit it comes fast.

It's got a random loot system. VERY RANDOM like you never know what the bad guy might drop. Lots of ""elements"" to deal with it. It has a so so craft system. It's not an ""open world"". It has creepy dr who like statues that scare the crap outa you. (well it did for me the first few times.) It can get pretty creepy. Always watch your health/mental state/ and radiation. It'll go quick. The bow (is an auto kill) it pretty much targets all bad guys without even trying. I feel like the throw system is wonky too.  I've only touched the story barely. I haven't done survival or adventure mode yet. If you like survival games it's worth the 15 for it."

76561198071936597,Recommended,463860,24417133,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,DeadClown3377,"I started off with survival mode.  Unfortunately the map isn't overly large at the moment, so that was pretty much the only minus for me.  I made it 17 days and got bored, so saw an entrance into something called the Rift Zone.  Welp, I decided to jump down into the green poison, knowing full well it may be the death of me.  I'm assuming the Rift Zone will be another area that comes into play later?The struggle is real in this game but for anyone that's played any type of survival game and is relatively good at it, you may find it a bit too easy.Here are the Pros and Cons I found in Survival ModePros:1. Great gameplay, thoroughly enjoyed the Melee combat2. Tension:  It's incredibly tense.  I very much so enjoyed the Sanity level aspect of the game.3. Graphics are good for now, but I'm sure they'll improve them slightly in the future.4. Love the RNG on loot for creatures.  I love not knowing what they'll drop.Cons:1. I saw like 4 rabbits in the 17 days of gameplay I survived.  You get Wool from Rabbits, so don't expect to make anything with wool for awhile2. Not alot of spawns of any type of creatures.  Counted maybe 20 bad guys in total, 1 statue (I think it was a statue), 4 rabbits and maybe about 10-15 rats.3. Terrain is boring.  Sorry to say it like that but it seriously is lacking in any kind of interesting thing to see. I know it's early access, but Dev's in a game like this, the Environment should be made to be interesting.4. There's about 7 houses to explore, they restock with items every now and then5. In some areas on the map, the FPS just drops for no apparent reason6. The bow is bad right now. It's auto target, never misses and does extremely poor damage.Again, this is just in survival mode.I'll be checking out the story mode next.  Keep up the good work.  I can see this game going very far and doing extremely well, as long as you folks at Gaijin keep focused!"
,Recommended,463860,26343005,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,MKSchmidt,"I see Shadows of Kurgansk a mashup between the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, and newer survival sandbox games.  Since S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was my favorite game, I found that I do enjoy Shadows.  However, the survival aspect seems a bit tedious at times, and could probably be improved.  The crafting is okay, but after a few hours of playing, I'm still struggling to understand how and why new items appear in the crafting menu, and how to craft certain items that have not yet appeared.  For instance, I have a quest to craft a lockpick, but there is no lockpick in the crafting menu. I am not sure if I need to find a new item in order for that option to shw up, or if I simply need to craft different things in order for the option to show up, or perhaps, there is some other way to figure it out that has not yet occurred to me.  It's good, but somewhat confusing at this point.Another point of difficulty is the rate at which the character gets hungry, he seems to always be hungry, and you have to eat a lot to keep him healthy.  Since time is sped up in the game world, it seems like they were going for realism, but in a sped up environment, which is a little tedious.  But also, they seem to have overstated the importance of eating a bit.  As far as I am aware, a human can live for several days without food, but in this game you will die if you don't eat in one day or less.Finally, I'm not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing, but they have a feature in which as time goes by, more difficult monsters will appear.  This means you have to progress at a certain rate in order to keep up with the monsters.  It adds to the difficulty and feeling of danger, but it's also kind of demoralizing.  I'm thinking I might need to start over in order to have a chance of winning at this point.Graphics are nice, they have a Borderlands cell shading effect.  I like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. like day-night cycle and changes in weather.  I also like the creepy visions and eerie sound effects they threw in.  It all adds to the mood of a persistent and dangerous world to explore.However, all these difficulties actually end up as more of a challenge than any kind of problem.  So I plan to continue playing and enjoying Shadows of Kurgansk.The only other issue, and this might only be a result of how little I've played, is that the map seems to be one narrow strip of land.  For a survival shooter, it seems a more open map (like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) would be better and more appropriate. perhaps it will open up as I continue exploring..."

,Not Recommended,463860,24383908,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,IHateMyLife,"Short version: The game is.. interesting. Not hardcore at all, very poorly designed, and needs a ton of work. It has somewhat of a leveling system based around how long you survive and how much you worked towards your survival. Basicallly the longer you survive the more points you get to use once you die to make your next life easier for you. Sounds kinda ridiculous  but when your able to buy items for your NEXT life to see what happens, kind of makes me think your playing god... In all, the game is bland and not very good at holding my attention, hopefully updates are done well and quick.Long Version: So, for 15$ I guess it was ""okay"" but seriously this game needs a ton of work. I jumped right into the ""survival"" portion of the game hoping for a straight up getting thrown into the wilderness with basically nothing, a fresh start with no idea what's ahead of me. I got almost half of that, you spawn in the same exact place with the same headline pop up with the same few sticks and apples infront of you. I figure, eh whatever it's just a spawn. Well you see, when you travel the map, it actually saves where you've been and sort of ""unlocks"" the map as you move through it, so basically once you have been somewhere, it is permanently shown on your map even after you have died and started an entire new life. The enemies do not have much variety and you will see numerous rats as basically the only animal next to the rabbit that lives in this ""zone"". The looting is what really upset me about the game, every single ""house"" or loot location is overwhelmed by anomolies... So literally any place you go to loot will no matter what give you some sort of STD. Curing this STD is not hard at all, you literally pick up a white mushroom off the floor and vuala, just like Mario, you are bigger (not literally) and back at it again. The crafting is rather sketchy... it involves a ton of clicking and searching around in your inventory and causes a lot of headaches when trying to figure it out. The graphics are pretty bad and definitely need touch-ups and actually gave me a headache after a half hour of playing, but I would not hold anything against the game regarding the visuals. The combat is fun, I enjoy seeing the damage amounts pop up when you hit or get hit by things. This game is not for the hardcore survivalist, but definitely for the lighter playing people who do not want to loot and actually get scared of dying. As of 7/18/16 I have this not recommended but we will see what happens in further updates."

76561198000561257,Not Recommended,463860,24527270,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Evnatia - The Mute Cynic,"Early Access Watcher Reviews Shadows of KurganskUpdate Version: Initial ReleaseDisclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer.Gameplay footage (Story: Deserted Shore):https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_ADGeI-gpjYThe survival genre has seen many iterations over the past couple of years and continues to be a logical starting point for new developers. It can offer an unmeasurable range of possibilities in both scale and creative freedom without the risk of watering down features. This month saw the release of Shadows of Kurgansk, which borrows elements from the famed STALKER series and has a artistic style similar to Borderlands. The story is grounded in a fight for survival as vicious zombies prowl the mysterious zone you have crash landed in. It is a premise that has been seen many times before, but that doesn't detract from the cell-shaded art style used in this new title.The visual aesthetic takes some getting use to in this game, more so with the sudden use of flashing images and continual lighting adjustments. Terrain textures are for the most part decent when dealing with leaves or rock formations, but appear flat with bushes. Monsters are generally hooded, pale humanoids with glowing eyes and animals look close enough to their real counterparts. You will see a gas with bright red eyes every once in awhile or a lumbering dog creature, but nothing really triggers a sense of fear. Environments are mostly decrepit buildings, boulders and trees with fruit scattered about ripe for the taking.  Anomalies are scattered about in the form of red mist, static discharge and varies colors of smoke, which looks alright given the aesthetic. One effect I did find to be astonishing was the pure evil tendrils swirling around some of the homes. The whole picture works for all intensive purposes, but doesn't get the needed support it requires from the sound department to create the full experience.I have yet to hear anything that could qualify as music, replaced instead with ambient noise and voice acting. While I did not have any issues with the voice work, one thing I found grating was the the deviation from the provided subtitles. One moment the speaker is following the script to the T, only to start wording a variation for the following portion. Sound work is pretty standard with wood crackles and crickets providing a background to the axe chops while gathering. Sudden heightened volume and screeching is used to reinforce the cheap jump scares and flashing images that encompass what qualifies as horror in this game. I ended up playing my own music in the background just to help fill the void left empty by the lack of overall sound.Content is divided into three game modes with each mode using a slightly different set of crafting recipes. Story mode offers two different tales (at the time of this review) with the main focus being to complete objectives in order to move forward. It is mostly fetch quests and ""go to this location,"" which is alright in comparison to the ""wait 24-48 hour"" quests that feel like unnecessary padding. Survival mode is your standard mix of crafting and eating to see how long you can avoid death. Right now their is a single map available with one currently blocked off by the same gas used in one of the story mode levels (which is why I tried using the same logic to see if it was open yet). Adventure mode, which uses the same map as survival, challenges you by completing objectives in as quickly as possible. There is only one adventure out right now (unless the second failed to pop up) so it is more a proof of concept than anything. Progress made in survival and story mode increase the points you can spend on the game's leveling system and carries over to both modes. You can increase resistance to mental effects, damage from weapons and even how much you can carry. It helps take on some of the more annoying enemies, especially with some their unfair advantages.The enemy has some bizarre tricks at their disposal thanks to some graphical issues and questionable hit box detection. Birds and zombies have a fascination with textures and can be found clipping into the ground or flying straight into walls. This can be extremely frustrating when the recently turned decide to nibble at your ankles only to have most of your hits registering with the ground. On separate occasions, they decided to just vanish into thin air as soon as they reached me. Zombies also have the ability to melee strike you from great distances when they initially attack you, which might explain why a stone sculpture was able to leap 20 yards to instant kill me as I turned away from it. Some zombies decide to just abandon their conflict with you and just swagger off as if you were no longer a concern. This is actually quite useful when fighting some of the larger enemies such as the Accursed Hunters. Fighting something can either be a royal pain in the rear or a confusing breeze due to these issues, but nothing compared to the mixed reactions crafting gives.The only way to really describe the crafting system is ""time consuming."" When you manage to locate the ingredients (either by sheer luck or randomly from enemies), you then need to wait for the item to be made. If you are building a workspace or shelter, the game decides where it will be built. If you are making an item, you have to select the item, wait for it to be made, then pick it up. This cannot be done in bulk, so Javelins, which take a second to make, requires you to open the window to start, close it, then do it again if you are making multiple. You can only make one type of an item at a time regardless of how many respectable crafting stations you have. The timer can accelerate if it takes too long, but the fact you need to wait at all just feels like filler. I can understand why this is done in multiplayer centric games (even if it is still annoying), but to do it in a single player experience is monotonous. (The reason for the timer is to allow the hunger, mental and radiation meters to adjust based on the time that passes).I have seen my fair share of survival games released onto Early Access and I while I give points to Shadows of Kurgansk for having something other than a survival mode, I found the overall experience to be forgettable. I found myself bored most the time just waiting for the next objective to open up or for that lock pick I was making to finish crafting. There is not much to do outside of crafting items during these periods of waiting in large part to the relatively small size of the maps. It is mostly due to these issues that I cannot recommend the game at this time. I will come back to this title in six months to see how it is coming along and hopefully the game will have a jump function by then.Pros- Art style is rough, but quite uniqueCons- Crafting is too menu intrusive- A lot of downtime/waiting- Texture/pop out glitches make combat frustrating"
