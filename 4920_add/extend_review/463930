Short and sweet, beating the game with all 11 achievements takes almost exactly as long as it takes for all the cards to drop, too (about 2 hours, cards dropped in 1.5). I wouldn't pay full price for it, but it's a good deal right now at 49 cents."

I got a 90% coupon off for it, and after quick glance at the in-game art style, I was convinced me to buy it.The game play is quite enjoyable. You play as this elder-god-mouth monster and you win a stage primarily by eating the ill-fated archaeologists. For the sake of the game being, fun, this creepy mouth monster is limited to only traveling through walls. The screen shots above will show you that these 2D walls may not connected, therefore making it impossible to kill that one last archaeologist, right? Well this is where the puzzle elements come into play. Your mouth-monster can posses stone blocks. These blocks can move side to side however they cannot defy gravity and elevator lift your block-possessing-mouth monster. You CAN fail a stage, however you immediately restart the puzzle, allowing the process of elimination approach to solving the game. However you do not have to fret about letting an archaeologist escape, as your job as the disembodied mouth guardian of the creepy temple in the middle of I-forgot-what-the-lore-journal-entry-stuff-said is merely to scare them off so they do not explore even deeper into the temple.Which brings me to the story. There is really inst one, or at the very least, a conventional narrative. However you learn more and more about the grim predicament of these archaeologists through missing journal entries. They explain why they're there, how scared they are feeling, and the like. These journal entries are unlocked after clearing out specific stages. It really helps add to this feeling of despair and unnerving atmosphere.Play it for close to an hour straight at 2 o'clock in the morning probably helped, but I felt genuinely unsettled by the ambient noise and dark environment. What might undermine the tone is the repeated archaeologist design used for, at least the first 20ish levels. In addition every archaeologist makes the same exact sound when they are scared into running of a cliff / about to be crunched by mouth man. On the other hand however, it adds to this comfy arcade feeling, reusing the archaeologist assets on an as need basis to establish minimalism. Game feels plenty scary enough already, but when it comes to quality of the setting, it's going to be more subjective than usual (can we even quantify the subjective? Does this logic!?)All in all the game feels very solid. Over the span of one hour I have experienced no crashes. So far I am past level 20 (I think) and not once so far has the game felt repetitive. Neither of these things are grand achievement by any means as I only have played just south of an hour, but still. I would recommend playing this game, as within the first twenty levels I can already justify buying this game for full price."

The puzzle mechanics grow in difficulty at a steady but never overwhelming pace, the music, graphics and sound effects are basic but enough to create an atmosphere making the story and levels more enjoyable.I bought the game for its sale price (0.50€) and I'm honestly convinced it's not worth 10 times more, but I had a good time playing the first 30 levels while reading the nicely-written story notes.

76561198132746363,Recommended,463930,24735988,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,Ravenant,"The Dweller is a minimalistic but satisfactory twist on a puzzle game with an eerie theme to it. This could be a puzzle game where you're trying to avoid, capture, or defeat a monster, but no, this puzzle game actually has human beings involved with your objectives; specifically, you have to kill them. Little pixelated Archaelogists standing about the caves, observing them and writing down notes, all placed in specific manners so as to make it increasingly difficult to slay them all. When this huge team of Archaelogists entered this cave, they unknowingly unleashed the wrath of a powerful monster that lives within it; that monster isyou.Yes, in this game, you play as a shadowy monster that must kill the Archealogists who have invaded it's cave, and you've got a number of ways to do it, ranging from simply devouring them on the spot with your  gaping mouth full of sharp teeth, to possessing rocks to crush them, to scaring them so much that they'll run off terrified and fall to their deaths from a high location or into a bottomless pit.The monster's primary weakness is that it may only travel through the ground and walls of the caves (exlcuding the background, of course, for the sake of gameplay) meaning once you have spawned, you're limited to moving in one section of the cave. To get past this issue, the monster can also move into small boulders and larger rock formations. Should these rocks line up with another section of the cave, the monster can use it to transfer itself between these now intersecting sections of the cave. While inside a rock, the monster has the ability to move the rock as it pleases, although limited to the ground it sits on. Stacking these rocks up and moving them in certain ways becomes the primary puzzle element in the game rather quickly, but it still changes things up and keeps you on your toes through a wide variety of level designs, different shapes of rocks that cover more height or ground, and a few other elements that either help the monster or act as obstacles to it. Either way, the game manages to keep things fresh enough overtime for it to be enjoyable to the end, and presents a variety of respectable puzzles.The game's story is simple enough, but more is revealed through a series of notes found after completing levels. They reveal additional plot details as well as  the experiences the Archaelogists you're attacking go through as they grow increasingly paranoid and become more and more aware of the monster's existence. There are a few twists here and there, but being a short game, these things are all it's story really needed. It gets the job done. And if you ask me, it's actually rather interesting. I'd like to see a continuation of it.The only potential drawback some might see with this game e is that it's rather short in length, but most people will probably get a few good hours out of it. Short as it is, I think it's worth it's price. Admittedly I did get this game with a coupon (which is also how I learned about it's existence. I think it's a shame this game is currently so unknown.) but I think I can still fairly say this little puzzle game is worth it's price. It provides an enjoyable experience, and $4:99 really isn't that much."

But I cannot seem to shake the idea that if I don't give this game its due, some terrible fate is going to befall me.My dreams have of late been haunted by visions of dark chasms and gargantuan caves deep beneath the earth filled with ancient sculptures and mystical symbols containing some long-forgotten warning from an ancient civilization. A foreboding certainty from those dreams linger in my mind after I wake: That I must decipher the symbols before it's too late... as if I'm forced to play some kind of puzzle game fraught with terrible meaning. Although I feel like I'm loosing my mind from fear, I'm absolutely certain that I must solve this mystery -- even if it only means uncovering the primordial evil that really lies behind this nightmare -- the Horror dwelling beneath."

76561197971341065,Recommended,463930,32372068,Posted: 12 June,all,sfnhltb,"An atmospheric and darkly amusing puzzle platformer where the aim is to deal with the pesky archaelogists digging into your home. Initially you can move through the walls and chomp anyone nearby, and possess boulders to drop on the hapless intruders heads, or chase them down.As you progress through the games a couple of new mechanics are introduced, such as a limited use teleport system to make some slightly more complex puzzles.As you progress you will also unlock pages from the diary of the lead archaelogist on the site, which exposes their mission and more about why they are here, the impact your actions are having on the team (firstly disbelieving despite all the missing team members), and also as they dig deeper you learn more about yourself (via what they are learning), and what you are doing in this long abandoned city.Overall it is pretty good - the puzzles don't get too repetitive, and I didn't find them either too easy (once any new concepts have been introduced), or too hard - you get stuck occasionally and have to think your way around the map, but the possibilities aren't endless, so it is difficult to be stumped too long."

I'm certainly not one for puzzle games in general, but the atmosphere, BGM, gameplay, and simple plot all drew me in.  The levels are either profusely simple or mindrackingly complex, but are executed logically.**Pixel Walking** The one thing that I thought was noteworthy, for a developer or any other player, was the fact that you can essentially do an equivalent of a pixel walk, as in Source engine games, in order to jump from boulders to walls or to whatever else.  I found myself feeling as if this was necessary in order to progress, though I'm not sure myself whether this would be considered a complaint."

I can't say graphics is very detailed or very beautiful, but it gives the right feeling (same for music, by the way). And that's most important.* Progressing difficulty. Levels are gradually becoming harder (though, level 8 took me around 10 minutes to figure out, but that might be just me), introducing player to the new mechanics one at a time (once in 2-3 levels, I'd say).* Fair amount of playtime. As I'm progressing, I think it's going to take me roughly 4 to 5 hours to complete the whole game.* Price. I've bought this game for $0.5, and this is more than a fair price for this game.- - - - - - -Cons:* While level design is okay, the color scheme doesn't change through the whole game.

Controls were responsive and intuitive (not hard to do with a point and click adventure, but still feels worth mentioning).  If I wanted to be hyper critical, I would mention the difficulty to payoff ratio is a bit skewed in that some levels were unbelievably, frustratingly, hear tearingoutingly hard.. but I had fun the whole time I was playing, so I can hardly call that a negative.

You can possess boulders and move around to get to other sectiosn of rock.Pros:+ Unusual and refreshing game mechanics.+ Simplistic game mechanics that can still require in some serious thinking to finish a level.+ While graphics are simplistic, they are still distinct and attractive.+ Sound effects and music is very nice.+ Interesting stoiry that's unlocked as you progress by reading the journal notes.+ Many, many levels.+ Full-screen mode doesn't mess with your monitor's resolution, runs at native resolution.Cons:- Music does get a little repetitive.- Some levels are fiendishly difficult. (Although there is a level skip function.)- Very little customization options.- Colour pallete used is rather plain and repetitive.Conclusions:Very good for a first-game dev, well done.Most of the cons that I have about this game are really just nitpicking, with one elephant in the room:  The total lack of customization options.Not being able to adjust sound volume is pretty much a required feature for most games, and only being able to turn sound and/or music on or off is not enough.Kudos to full-screen mode not messing up the monitor's resoluion (something that even AAA game devs can't seem to get straight.)  But not being able to adjust the size of windowed mode makes playing it windowed at higher resolutions a real pain.Over all, would reccomend.I'd rate it on the Indie scale as 4/5.

Along comes The Dweller, with bare-bones simple visuals, uncomplicated audio and goofy physics, and single-handedly provides better entertainment than at least 50% of the AAA market. How's that?First of all, The Dweller scores a mega-hit in the atmosphere department, where the bleak visuals, the moody music (soundscape?) and the to-the-point representation of the game's protagonist work perfectly together to put the player in the mood of an eldritch cave system haunted by something horrible. Only this time the player isn't one of the explorers - he's the something horrible. Our hero is trying to defend his domain from the peeking eyes and hands of scientists, dealing with them rather brutally, while the science team gradually starts to realise that the boulders don't just seem to move behind their backs, the earth swallowing people is not an unfortunate cave-in, and people don't disappear because they've gone for a long walk. While the game itself is a series of puzzle screens, solving them uncovers more and more story fragments. Simple as it can be, but very effective.When someone creates something as spot-on as The Dweller as his first game, he's either a genius or very, very lucky. Maybe a mix between the two. We'll see how it will move with Villainous' next attempts, but whatever happens later, The Dweller remains what it is - a simple and fun puzzle game with an incredible atmosphere and an excellent sense of dark humour. Highly recommended."

Also, gotta love the little bits of Lovecraftian inspiration thrown in.  I'd say it's worth your five bucks (or, well, a little less as it is on sale at the moment).Edit: Just a warning though, it is on the short side if you catch on quickly.  Some people might take longer than myself, and others might breeze through it even faster.  I thought I should throw that in there.To the developer:First game, was it?  I think I remember seeing that.  If so, well done.  It was entertaining.  The ending could've been a little more complex, but I won't elaborate to avoid spoilers.  Also, if you do future endeavors such as this one I'd suggest ramping up the difficulty considerably toward the end.  Almost felt like the hardest part was around the half-way to three-quarter mark.  Perhaps it was the final change, or evolution if you want to call it that.  It kind of felt like the last added mechanic was highly overpowered, but it was satisfying in its own right so I personally forgive it."

Truly said I expected at least some chasing action, with blood and gore and scared people, but after all, this is a PURE puzzle game, and dead guys are not fun to chase because it's nothing but the animation, not a real chase. Barrels rolling to the stars on the ground? There is no HUNTING action at ALL. The story provided by the unlocked notes is not helping as well.If you want another puzzle game - this game probably will be good for you, I got bored of the same mechanics after like 15-20 levels.If you want to be a cave monster eating people - not the best game for you.p.s.Has steam cards and achievements./why upvote - it's a puzzle game, if you like pure puzzles - good for you."

It took some time to understand the how the game wanted to be played but my playtime wasnt a very fun or pleasing experience, there was no sense of accomplishment, just figure out the level and move on. In the beginning I pressed 6 a lot to get past the levels I didnt properly undertand the game rules. Game feels flat as bridges doesnt break, bleak graphics ect. It has a few moments.This is one special game. Like every other game this game takes time to play. However, I can easily think of 200+ games Id rather spend time with. If this is that special game you are looking to spend time with by all means go ahead.I think this game would have been more fun if there was destructable bridges, water, machinery and possibly some spells to scare people or make a cave in.The game wasnt that bad, it just didnt appeal to me. I want puzzle with colors rather than blood and dirt. I first played 7 minutes and felt it was a waste of time. I later came back to it and played through the first 13 levels. If this was your favorite game I would be suprised and feel uneasy being around you, with that said I would not buy or reccommend this game for a friend.

It might need a more complex AI, that does more than run away and fall to certain death. The puzzles were never really challeging but still fun to solve. The difficulty went rollercoaster sometimes, but with the purpose to introduce new gameplay elements.I was sad it was over so quickly. With more complexity, harder puzzles and double the length a sequal could really be one of my favorite games. Bought it for 1€ and so it became one of the best buys I ever made. Definatly worth buying and it had nothing that disturbed me.Next time introduce some resolution settings!"
,Recommended,463930,24372801,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,Wizard Styles,"Recommended because when a game lets you play a ghost monster that can possess boulders to crush Indiana Jones knock-offs I'm willing to cut it some slack. It's not without problems, though.As you may notice, I have played this game for 3 hours. I also got the 100% completion cheevo. So for an asking price of 5 bucks, you don't get a whole lot of game here.What you get are 59 short, single-screen levels, which ideally would be enough to keep you busy for a much longer time were it not for three things.First, a lot of the levels are there to introduce or familiarize the player with mechanics. These hands-on tutorials are great, but in The Dweller there are just too many of them relative to those levels where the game goes all out.Second, relatedly, there's not much of a difficulty curve, and there aren't that many challenging levels.Third, without saying too much the last couple of levels change the gameplay completely, and for the worse/easier.The game's good levels are a lot of fun, though, and figuring out the right moves to crush one archaeologist in front of a second one who then gets scared enough to run off the nearest cliff in a panic is just extremely gratifying.The graphics and sound, while not exactly AAA level, add to that darkly humorous atmosphere, as do some journal notes you unlock along the way.In short, given the short playing time I'd wait for a sale, but I can still recommend this to anyone looking for an atmospheric, not too difficult puzzle game."

I like how you really have to think about the best way to kill these innocent people searching through your cave.The story, although minimal, was actually pretty good. It's told through random leters you find after each stage, written by some of the acrheoligists.The only problem is that It's rather short and the final boss was anticlimactic.

,Recommended,463930,31747967,Posted: 14 May,all,Silly Boi,"The Dweller is a Puzzle game about a group of young, daring, and probably attractive archaeologists who gradually fall victim to a monster in a cave. Of course, considering that you're the monster, it provides a neat twist on those familiar with the adventure genre.The goal of each level is simple: Kill Indiana Jones, to do so you are granted the ability to meld into walls and possess rocks to munch, crunch and generally disqualify them from any upcoming beauty contests.The game is controlled entirely with the mouse and it all works rather well, there was some performance problems where I couldn't move a rock I was posessing, but a few clicks remedied that and there was never any time where that issue caused me to fail a level. Oh, and there was one time where I somehow managed to posess two rocks at once which was kinda weird.Basically the game is a bit rough around the edges, and unfortunately the game is rather short. I 100% completed the game in only a few hours and felt that the ending (even though narrative is clearly not a main feature of the game) was weak since how you perform in the final level does not affect the outcome from a narrative standpoint.The puzzles themselves are well thought out and do fill the player with satisfaction upon completion, and the new game mechanics that are gradually added throughout the game are well balanced.I feel that if you are uncertain about purchasing the game, wait for it to go on offer. Either way, I garauntee you'll have a good time with this one."

This is a solid three of five stars. It's an entertaining physical puzzle game with (mostly) adaquate graphics (the mostly is for a couple of times when  it was not immediately obvious that there was a remaining archeologist to smash simply due to the nature of the graphics).  My one big caveat is that it does require some dexterity to solve, which, as far as I'm concerned, is always a huge minus  for any puzzle game.  It's a genre I chose becuase of physical limitations and when the description does not indicate that it will be required it feels like a cheat on the part of the devs, especially when it doesn't occur immediately so that I can refund."
