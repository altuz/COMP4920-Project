It's rare. Happened me only twice in 59 hours (dev said will be fixed in next patch. Due soon).-A few spelling mistakes.-Some missions can get repetitive (It's personal choice really. I didn't find it too bad but worth a mention).------Cons list is for informative reasons only, my personal opinion is that none of them really detracted from the game for me.------The rest of the review is more detailed on certain aspects of the game and my personal feelings. You don't need to read it if not interested.------I have to say I really enjoyed this game and it came out of nowhere for me. I knew nothing about it and just saw it as newly released and decided to pick it up.I'm very glad I did.A few people have mentioned price but for me I think it is priced fairly and is one of the main reasons I bought it without knowing anything about it.I have more then got my monies worth out of it.I know not everyone is into achievements but for me if I enjoy a game they are a way to keep me playing and in this case they worked a treat because I wanted to beat the game on all levels.This lead to me having a very good understanding of the game and so I can counter some of the negatives people have mentioned. Not to undermine their opinion but instead to give my personal experience with the game.Unbalanced. I found myself thinking this sometimes but it turns out the game is balanced, you just have to learn it. The game is hard but if you are getting owned you need to rethink your tactics or unit setups/composition.Some things are a little unclear which can make the game harder at the start and put people off.I posted my concerns on the forum and the dev was very quick to respond and very nice and a patch is said to be in the works.Timers at certain points in the game may make you rush but you can use up the time to advance your base and tech just make sure you leave enough time to get to any mission you want to be able to do.The game informs you of travel times when you hover over destinations and you can also travel to and sit on top of a crucial mission but not take it until you are at the last of the timer.Hovering over enemy hq's while in a battle will tell you how many units it has left to send into that battle so that helps a lot and is not something that was very clear to me initially but it is there.There is a point in the game where missions can seem repetitive but this is down to personal preference and I personally enjoyed playing every one because I enjoyed the game so much.You don't have to do every mission either, you can decide what you are willing to concede.One of the things that can make the game seem unfair is if you don't re-capture taken territory quickly enough the enemy will reinforce it and the mission will get harder and harder.It goes from easy (green text and one bar on map), medium (yellow text and two bars on map) and hard (red text and three bars on map).This was something I missed and couldn't make sense at first, why enemies where attacking areas they already owned and it made me think the game was either bugged or it didn't matter if I let the timer run out.It turns out that they are reinforcing the area and thus the missions can get very tough if you don't try to keep things in check.However, how much you are prepared to work and counter really is up to you. If the mission timer is crucial and a must take mission, the game will tell you in the mission text.There are a few other things I could mention but I would be heading into spoiler territory and I won't do that.All I can say is that for the few shortcomings the game might have in some peoples view, I really loved it and I think the devs did a fine job.If you like a challenge try it on normal and if you don't think that is unbalanced or you are finding battles too easy then congrats, you are pretty good at strategy games and should move up to hard.Please keep in mind that things ramp up so try not to judge too quickly.I would recommend beating it on normal before going to hard.If you are not a strategy buff but like turn based games and like the look of this then I would say play it on easy. It should still give you a nice challenge and once you are familiar with the way the game and timers work you will be better able to take on normal and hard. If you so choose.If you made it this far. I thank you for your time and I hope this review helps you."

Grab it on a sale if you want a simple turn-based adventure to kill some time with, but don't expect to be wow'ed or inspired by any means.+ Gets the basic turn-based mechanics right. It's definitely on the simple end of the spectrum, but nice for an entry-level kind of game.+ Decent effects, art and models.+ Acting with your units will use up the same resource as placing new ones on the field. At first this just felt weird, but after a while I came to like the design.-/+ Simple gameplay design. You've got your artillery unit, your frontline units, some hero characters(without interesting abilities), some scouts, etcetera. It's all very familiar.- Some of the interesting gameplay mechanics and features take a while to unlock. And by ""interesting"" I mean standard features such as ""taunting"" and allowing a unit to ""hit and run"" during the same turn.- Uninspiring story. Yawnable even.- I get the weird impression that this game is a ported mobile game, almost as if the developers earlier have or wanted to go in the ""freemium"" direction, but somehow changed their minds and just removed the premium currency. UI is also rather uninspiring and misaligned at times.-- Poorly explained and ""unfair"" challenges during some story missions, such as enemies spawning at otherwise illegal locations, or a character may loose or gain abilities without warning. This feels cheap and broken, rather than interesting or challenging.-- Gets VERY grindy after a while. I litteraly spent hours just repeating random defence missions that never really changed, trying to bank enough cash to unlock the story-related buildings."

The base management is clearly inspired by XCOM - it's a stripped down version the 'ant colony' from that game. The tactical battles are as in Elven Legacy, cramped spaces in which you must plot your moves in chess-like fashion. I recommend playing on Hard for a nice challenge. The graphics and UI are fine - cartoonish, but serviceable. There's no voice acting and the story is very much to the point. 4.4 hours in and I've completed the first planet, having to retry a couple of missions 4-5 times. Apparently there's 30 or so missions in the campaign, so that's got to be at least 15+ hours of playtime without dipping into multiplayer. All in all, I'm having more fun with this than I've had with a game in months. Bravo!EDIT: a week later, I've completed the game on Hard in abotu 25 hours of game time. My only disappointment is that I'm finished. Excellent game :)"

The campaign is wonderful, allowing you to make units beforehand and use them in battle durring the actual fight. The shear amount of units available to use suits many play styles...there is nothing so far I've found wrong with it. It's a must buy for any fan of turn based stratagy. Definatly gets my recomendation, no doubt what so ever."

Reminds me a bit about X-com the way the base is layed out and the resource management, overall it is well worth the money."
76561198004033968,Not Recommended,464100,34178653,Posted: 11 August,all,Soju,This game came so close to being great.  There is a good variety of units and upgrades that can creates a lot of strategic depth and the first half of the game is incredibly fun.  It all falls apart towards the end when your hero units become so incredibly powerful that there is no reason to ever use the regular units. And in the later levels you have no choice but to use the hero units which completely negates all time and resource investment in your regular units.

Core TBS combat is cookie-cutter affair, few surprises and fewer outright innovative mechanisms (that I've seen yet). However, that's not to say it's bad - it's very familiar and easy to grasp even for casuals of the genre.Pros:Familiar and polished, but simplified TBSHas all the regular features - zone of control, movement costs, LoS targeting, special attacks, special abilities.AP points system offers a fresh strategic take on the genreWell integrated real time base buildingCons:TBS combat lacks depth - terrain only offers movement bonus/penalities and no other featuresScenarios esp. early on are a little small in scale - lots of small fast skirmishes rather than prolonged battles (personal opinion)Real time base building feels like a freemium game (a sentimental criticism rather than a gameplay one)Real time base management offers a fresh between combat fun on its own. Plays like all the freemium time-based base builders out there. Construction queues, unit production & management, resouce management (cash, common & rare resources) with a player controlled time acceleration feature (that stops at points of interest) plus research & customization (unit modules)."
,Recommended,464100,29494510,Posted: 25 January,all,FroBodine,"I really like this game so far!  I have only played for two hours or so.  I have done five battles, and built my base up quite a bit.  The base building is very similar to XCOM, and that's ok in my book.  It works well in this game.  There appear to be lots of upgrades to your building modules, e.g. you build a command center that gives you money.  Then later you can upgrade that command center to improve its output (I think, I haven't upgraded it yet).  There are a good amount of buildings, foundries, workshops, hangars, factories, and I'm still very early in the build tree.The combat is standard hexagon map with turn-based combat.  The very unique part of this is the action point mechanic.  Basically, you have so many action points (AP) per turn, and you can use them to move and attack, or deploy more units to the map (based on how many units you built back at your base).  So, there are always tough decisions whether or not to deploy another unit, or move your units and press an attack.  It's very unique and I love it.  One reviewer said it got pretty difficult later on, as the AI always seemed to have more APs than you, but we'll see.So far so good.  It's a fun game, the combat is enjoyable, and the base-building is quick and easy and has enough variety to keep me interested.  I hope the game continues as well as it started, as I'm having a blast!So, my early review is a big old fat thumbs up!"
,Recommended,464100,25261728,"Posted: 30 August, 2016",all,valambrian,"The main part of the game is a string of tactical battles tied together into a campaign. The core of the battle system is the action points. You spend them to move units, to attack enemies, and to deploy new units on the battlefield. More powerful units take more APs to deploy (for example, you have to spend 1 AP to deploy a jeep, but a tank or an artillery piece needs 4 APs). Occupying neutral bases increases the number of APs you can spend per turn. Occupying enemies' bases also robs them of this crucial resource.Between battles you upgrade the base, research unit upgrades, and build more units to replace losses and to prepare for the next challenge. You also get unit components as loot. You can attach the components to unit types, making them even more powerful. Some of the components have trade-offs, for example, you can get regeneration at the price of the incleased AP cost to deploy the unit or increase attack while decreasing defense. The mechanics are not overly complicated but still leave ample room for interesting decisions."
,Recommended,464100,30677087,Posted: 22 March,all,CallmeNezo,"Really really a great game, its kinda hard even on normal (Doesn't bother me) Its makes it a bit more spicey. I'm restarting the missions alot for making the best possible outcome since you want to keep as many units and saving some resources for other things for next missions. I love the stronghold/base idea and it works very well, but having to keep in mind what buildings are best for future missions too.I can see myself playing it for a while, since it makes me think, abit angry sometimes and challenging.The Al are weird, sometimes it very smart and destroys you're future moves, and sometimes it does what you want it too. But there is also sometimes it makes weirdass moves making it sometimes abit to easy.I hope more people will buy the game since its very good, and making it possible for the devs to makes some great updates and later on making some more awesome games."
76561198028124284,Recommended,464100,28695260,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,wolf_cub_one,"I've been looking for a game that is similar to Military Madness(Nectaris).  This game has a similar feel to it and is very fun to play.  The base building and time management gives it a nice strategic component.  Some times it feels impossible to beat a map until you understand how to either correctly make use of the advantages/disadvantages of your units and that of the enemy units.  Other times, it's about understanding how the map has certain triggers that help you along the way.I like the fact that the maps are small so that each battle can be completed in short bursts.  Each new upgrade that you get really makes a huge difference in the success or failure of a mission.  It's also nice that each of your units really do feel different and have their own skill tree.I've caught up to the latest update(#5).  Hopefully, it won't be too long before the next phase of the game comes out.  The game still continues on in that the enemy keeps trying to reconquer back areas that you've already won.  It keeps you on your toes.From what I've played so far it's a solid game that I highly reccomend for those who enjoy fun and fair turn base strategy games."
,Not Recommended,464100,30638904,Posted: 20 March,all,CTi flauxhawk,"Codex of Victory suffers from questionable design decisions that, as a lover of strategy games, ruined my experience and enjoyment with the game.The first issue, and the most egregious, is that units aren't limited in targeting. For example, artillery units can easily target both air and land units. This essentially makes certain units pointless and leads you more toward a rush strategy.The second is non-sensical enemy spawns. Normally you can only deploy additional units in a pre-set deployment zone. If you capture a city, however, you are allowed to deploy your units in the city and its surrounding hexes. Several times after capturing all the cities on the map the ""storyline"" spawned enemy units in locations that were otherwise illegal. It's essentially the developers ignoring their own rules in order to create a challenge. Instead of rewarding the player for achieving an astounding success by having captured cities quickly it ignores it completely and essentially cheats.Overall, a disappointment. Good turn-based strategy games are few and far between, and this title certainly makes that even truer."

Keep in mind that this is story driven, so its not like you build a base, and enemies will come to you, or you can expand and take other other enemies' bases. It is story based. With that said, the combat seems to be diverse and entertaining and has an XCOM-esc feel. A nice casual game that seems to be lots of fun, but keep in mind, it IS story based."

I also agree with some other comments that the base building could be better. It does kind of feel like justa tacked on addition that doesn't generate many decision points.  In between missions is just build army back up, to then send out on the next mission.  Overall, I was engaged playing, but not sure about te replayability.

The company does make mobile games so I think they just used the same game engine/studio software and layout.  The game itselfis...ok?Not worth the 15$ so it get's a thumbs down.  If it was say 5$ I'd reconsider.  I thought this was going to be more.  It feels like you should be able to choose different missions and defend different sections of your claimed land while advancing the story.  Or do more in the base.  But the base simple serves as a place to hang out between story missions.  if there is more, I didn't bother getting to it as the game made it's statement that this was going to be it."

The mechanics are not overly complicated so battles are really shaped by the player's decisions, and this makes the gameplay dynamics really interesting.  There are great opportunities for strategic planning, choosing which units to build and upgrade between battles, and tactical execution to get the most out of those units in the battles. This is what makes the game shine.  I found myself redoing missions (even successful ones) just to try the mission with different units or tactics.  I like that the turn-based gameplay affords enough time to think about what to do next even in tricky situations, not just relying on reaction time.  For me this also means I can play with my kids (and against them in multiplayer).The visual style is really well developed, a pleasing blend of reality/rendering and futuristic space Sci-Fi.  The human characters in the story are a bit reminiscent of Dune.Now I am eager to get the next instalment of battles in the campaign storyline.  Also I vote +1 for more than the built in autosave, I would like a bit more control of when to save, and saving during combat missions."

I am very glad I decided to get this one.  The first few missions are quite simple but after that it really gets good.  I like that what you do in the strategic base portion actually matters in the tactical game.  What units you create and what powerups you give them  make a big difference.  Also, there is not any ""rigt way"" to do things that I can tell, different strategies combined with different tactics will work, some better than others.  Experimenting is fun in this game.  So far there seems to be a good balance of time and avaialble resources in the strategic phase.  You have some time to build your forces between missions but not forever and you can't just upgrade everything fully and breeze through.At the moment you can't save in game, which isn't terrible as the battles aren't huge but it will be nice to have that ability.Even though this game starts easy and plays like a casual game, it really isn't.  It requires thought once you get farther along into it.  I add this game to my list of ""just one more turn"" games.I am also very happy that this game is available for Linux as I have been moving away from Windows and the more quality Linux games that come out, the better."

I'm willing to give it one more try, but this is getting ridiculous.  I'm only playing on Normal.  So is my only solution to play the game on Easy just to get past this one stage?  I have tried different tactics a dozen times on one stupid map and still I cannot stop the enemy from spamming me to death with units in round 3 (and after I barely clean those up a fresh wave of 4 units literally teleport next to my squad and open up on me, forever and ever since my enemy has infinite units, AP resource, etc.).

You'll find a host of basic issues that no strategy game in 2017 should have. Things like poorly designed units who make other units obsolete, hard to use special abilities, finicky click boxes (It's all done with right-mouse button clicks and you have to be very precise), and the tutorial is absolutely terrible, it explains nothing, not even which mouse button you have to click with. It demonstrates nothing, and is way too short to impart knowlege, and you can lose it surprisingly easily just by mis-moving a unit, not that you know you're mis-moving. Oh, and you can't play it in 1920x1080 resolution even though they give the option. It's always a rule of thumb to me. Don't trust developers who can't even get their options right. It's just not smart.To put it in perspective. I could tell all of this by losing the tutorial once, and look at my library, I play streategy games all the time.
