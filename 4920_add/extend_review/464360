The developers have put some serious work and love into this game, and it shows.TLDR;  BUY THIS GAME!"

Star control, space Quest, Star Trek the 25th-anniversary game and many others would keep me and my pals awake till odd hours of the night.  Trying to complete these games in record time, or with better scores, or just figure them out in the first place.  For a long time, I've had the itch to relive that kind of gaming experience.3030 Deathwar Redux manages to scratch that itch in a very novel way.   Without the constraints of being too ""realistic"" or ""edgy"" or ""simulator"" oriented, the devs are able to tell a story free from the shackles of having to EXPLAIN the science of it all, while at the same time, reference countless sci fi genre tropes with blatantly in your face easter eggs.For anyone who has played and loved Games like Star Control or especially Space Quest, you will instantly appreciate this.I have only had a short time with the game, and I can already see myself enjoying the open world space exploration and combat, and the humorous story and dialogue are right up my alley keeping it fresh and fun.It doesn't hold your hand too much, you have to figure a few things out as you go, but it does a fair job of guiding you to learning the ropes as you play.  Gently suggesting at the next reasonable course of action to get yourself back on track ASAP.It's not a perfect game by any means, and if you aren't into the brand of humor and gameplay it uses to tell it's a story you might not care for it at all.  If all you care about are high rez 3d computer crushing graphics, super easy linear shooters or anything like that, you probably won't want this game. However, had this come out in the 80s or 90s, it would have been a classic that would have shaped a generation of gamers perception of how to do a space sci fi game for the next decade.If you still have a soft spot for the old classics like the ones I mentioned at the start, you need grab this game and make a nice hot Tea and sit down on a rainy day and give this a whirl.  For the price of a movie ticket you will have more than your moneys worth."

Deathwar Redux puts an Indiana Jones/Rebel Galaxy spin on that, and brings in other kinds of mechanics to make the game interesting(the warp drive/fuel system, nebulas, keeping upgrades). It did a great job of being its own kind of game, yet still relates to other games i loved. so i give it an 8.5/10That said there a few small things:-occasional sound bugs, music stops playing, SFX stop working-maybe i missed something, so this could be inaccurate, but i'd like to see more story with Kent and Vasquez-the game isn't skimpy on content, and story, but as an EV Fan, I'd like more story lines.All in all, i enjoyed playing this game, and definitely recommend it to a like minded gamer(Read: loves EV like games)To the Dev,you created a great game, and you have a fun platform. I'd love to see how you expand on this story. I'll be back if you do."

,Recommended,464360,22780290,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,USER404,"I discovered the old version of this little gem a while ago and it was instant love, so i was really looking forward to see the new version on steam. It may be in early access, but the game is complete and will only expand on what exist and get better during this period.This game touch a few genres and make winks to classic cult movies and games with its tongue-in-cheek dialogues and encounters, and also making use of with its artwork. This last aspect may not be the finest but it really does it works portraying familiar worlds and characters. Here you can see aspects not only other great space sim games, but also from games of the adventure genre: the main character is an Indiana Jones wannabe and those colorful yet shady space stations will give you this bladerunneresque feel...Even if there are elements made with nostalgic purposes this is a game that stand on his own. It is well made technically, the fighting AI is great and provides you with a decent challenge, the fact that there several ways to earn money avoid grinding, the big open world encourages exploring, and the history is compelling and makes you want to play the next chapter to see how the plot evolve. Oh, and that soundtrack is a score! it is very varied, but it all sounds great. Sometimes adding to the retro half of the game and sometimes to the half futuristic.Another aspect to take into account is that the devs are passionate and really eager for feedback and ideas to keep expanding the game.So if you like old school spaceships, adventure or 2d games in general, this is a must have to your collection!"

The thing that sets it apart from others like it is:1. Story is not told via menus.  You get out of your ship, walk around in station bars and jet pack around salvage sites.2. It has parts that remind me of 2d adventure games, like Blade Runner.3. The story is actually interesting and has funny moments.  Big dose of scifi references.4.  It doesnt hold your hand but also doesnt need wiki assist.  You can gather valuable info by talking to people in bars or by buying data spread across stations."
,Recommended,464360,35091518,Posted: 20 September,all,Kung Fu Sandwich,"3030 Deathwar Redux plays sort of like a 2D version of Elite Dangerous crossed with a Lucas Arts style adventure game.Explore deep space, dock at stations and talk to shady and quirky characters at the bar over Cocktails which the robot bartender admits he doesn't know how to make but he does anyway (spoilers: They're horrible), take on delivery and bounty hunting missions, buy new ships, explore derelict spacecraft in zero-G and get in to dog fights.There's an interesting story to follow and the sweary badguys are hilarious and argue with eachother like Saturday morning cartoon baddies.The navigation and upgrade menus are very easy to use and understand which is something that a lot of space games get wrong which is nice too.Enjoying it a lot so far!"

,Recommended,464360,23231166,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,Vantillay,"Very enjoyable game from the get-go. I love the atmosphere and I love how the world progresses and feels like it evolves throughout, with headlines and news articles going on as things unfold around you, when in stations the seperate semi-visible other portions of the stations with vehicles and whatnot, and the intercom calling out new intakes of Stock and depertures etc. You can totally imagine this being a viable and real world and it's amazing.Story so far is pretty great, can't really say anything without spoilers but it's pretty interesting but sometimes it may be confusing as it ends up progressing whilst you're not doing ""story missions"" where sometimes it just does stuff as time goes on.Settings and whatnot are very good, for youtubers / streamers you can avoid the ballache of editing and copyright strikes from a basement dweller thanks to the devs including the option to disable copywrited tracks in the settings. And my personal favourite, you can check to turn of vocal music and only have instrumental, which I absolutely love and it makes the experience much better. Graphics options are plentiful for allsorts of various options and crap if your system has trouble processing some stuff.Only negatives I can think of are the map is a little strange and doesn't auto-update nebula spots, you can't really set a course to an undiscovered star system, and also the scavenging mini-part is very short and I feel it would be really exciting to expand upon. Honestly haven't looked much/at all into the development so far so take this with a mound of salt, but the salvaging / inside of ship stuff would be super cool to have more details and exploration towards.Combat is very fun and basic, maybe be somewhat hard to figure out at first, and honestly battles seem to lean in favour of whoever can turn the hardest because if they can auto-manuever you you're pretty ♥♥♥♥ed, even in a pretty heavy ship, unless you got missiles or something. I stick with tiny ships haven't gone into heavy stuff much tbh.Aside from that, a very fun game to hop into and play for a good few hours. I'd say honestly 7.5/10 But definately leaning towards more an 8-9/10 and especially when this becomes more improved in the future, I seriously can't wait it's been very fun so far, just feel the 'little things' are missing here and there. Maybe a more interactive environment or making the place seem more alive rather than the same few NPC's standing still in stations, explore inside derilicts / wrecks / ships / stations further, that sort of thing."

Its graphics and banter are quirky in the best of ways and really make for a surprisingly immersive experience.The missions vary and you're able to play all the fun roles you've come to expect from space-faring games. Sure, the missions do get a bit repeatative and some pay out much more than others, but the main story is broken up in a way that keeps drawing you in with every snippet you see.The game seems to have a lot going on at first, but it's never felt overwhelming to me at all - even without hand-holding. I recommend using keyboard/mouse controls and taking the time to go watch a 2hr+ gameplay video before buying it, but at the current price, it's so very much worth it. The soundtrack is great, but keep in mind that if you do watch videos online, you won't hear it due to copyrights.I'm just getting started, but I can already tell I'll sink an easy 40+ hours into this gem of a game.If you like space games and retro design done in a superbly modern way, don't hesitate to get this one.11/10, I can't stop squashing every bug on every console in the galaxy.It's my obsession."

This is the type of game you're always looking for but almost never find. Tons of depth, interesting story, great pacing, and an astoundingly refreshing balance between all of the different ways you can spend your time in-game. I'm still finding new gameplay aspects to pursue and have been repeatedly surprised by how well everything flows from one activity to the next, along with the fact that unlike most games, I have yet to feel like something's missing or that something should have been done differently (not that I claim to be an expert). Just an all-around great game for a great price. I'm surprised it isn't more popular than it is, but I assume that will change with time. Do yourself a solid and get this game, you won't be disappointed."

There are lot's of NPC's flying around in-space, bantering and moving around in stations which makes the game feel alive.  The artwork colorful and thoughtout, though for some sprites I felt that a finer grain of detail would be an improvement, but isn't really an issue that hurt my experience at all.  There's lots of stuff to do, from mining asteroids to doing courier missions, to bounty hunting pirates, to looting derelict spacecraft.I'm pretty satisfied with this game for the cost, so far I've sank in a few hours and it's been a lot of fun.

I had no issues with the story or the missions and didn't encounter any bugs that affected gameplay.Can't fault the game. Was fun to play, was a good blend of the old LucasArts style games and the old retro blasters all crossed with Privateer (which was one of my favourite games back in the day).I would like to have seen even more upgrade options for the ships (though there are lots) and more weapon mounts. I found salvaging to be a bit too hard to see what was going on, even with the drone light on. Couldn't find out how to reconfigure keys, which wasn't a massive problem and considering the massive number of shortcuts to menus etc I can see why this may have been an issue; I just kept hitting shift instead of ctrl and would have liked to have swapped their actions.The story progresses nicely at your own pace which is nice however it does reach a point (near the end) where you a pretty much locked into itbecause of the un-clearable bounty, you can only dock at 4 stations. It's nice you can continue to play after the story has finished.I hope they add a new chapter to this in the future, it deserves more."

Great atmosphere and retro style, story is enough to give you an overall objective if you're not distracted by (you will be) exploring, doing trading missions, and killin' pirates. Enough depth to take it more serious, but simple enough you can play it relaxing-ly as well."

All in all a nice little space sim.One complain though, having to complete all your missions to save your game is just tedious and take me out of the game, I get what they were going for but it doesn't work for me and just make me stop playing if there was an option to autosave even with missions it would be great.Don't let that discourage you though It is a great game worthy of your money"

Don't expect a huge amount of depth of gameplay here or a highly memorable plot - it's servicable at best - but for fifteen bucks it's a great 7 hours (main storyline with some futzing about doing courier / combat missions) of entertainment.

Pixel art graphics, not too many controls and all in 2D. Yea, not very 2016, right?Well, who cares, the artwork is just perfect and somehow reminds me of the old Lucas Arts and Sierra point & click adventures like Indiana Jones and Gabriel Knight.So what makes 3030 Deathwar Redux so good or even outstanding?If it's not for the graphics (if you're the person who needs AAA top nodge textures and models)- First, the music; it's just a perfect fit for this genre and really helps setting the mood.- Second, we got the dialogs; oh my there're some really funny gems among them and the general quality of the writing is of a very high level. (Much higher than the quality of this review)- Third thing up are the small, unseen things like handling and gameplay in general. Man, it's really cool that you have to navigate by yourself if you want to ""jump"" to a different system. No auto-pilot click here we go stuff. Nope, check your fuel, check your course and of we go. (Oh, crap, got a couple of degrees of course. Just awesome)I haven't played that much yet, but so far, I'm having more fun with this game than with a handful of other new games on Steam."

,Recommended,464360,35462091,Posted: 3 October,all,DarKcyde,"3030 Deathwar is like Elite Dangerous with soul.  The pixel graphics are beautifully low-fi, and the game-play is a mixture of open world style exploration/trading/mining/salvaging/bounty hunting.  Space flight is top-down Asteroids arcade style.  Unlike many open world games, there is a solid storyline, which you can choose to progress or ignore.  Stations and cutscenes are presented in old school adventure game style.  Also chalk full of easter eggs and old school space references.  You can do the Kessel Run!  Lastly, the music deserves special mention.  Several genres of music are represented, many of the songs just put a smile on your face.The Good:-Space game exploration/trading/mining/salvaging/bounty hunting!-Pixel graphics-Music-ReferencesThe Bad:-Can't remap keys.-???"
