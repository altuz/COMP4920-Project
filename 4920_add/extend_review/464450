,Recommended,464450,26041814,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,Rayge,"So I'm going to start off by saying I'm not a guy who plays OG arcade ports of these games so I am not going to compare them to that seeing as how it would be freaking impossible for these guys match slowdown from static hardware to that of dynamic hardware.You ask most people who have bought this game who aren't elitist diehards who own PCBs of the originals and they will tell you that this is an awesome game. And THAT is all you need to know. You have people who don't want others to enjoy a different version of DoDonPachi, because to them it's some kind of sacrilegious act since scores from this version can't be compared to scores from other versions.I sort of had this mindset with Cave's first release on STEAM with Mushihimesama and I quickly learned to just look at these releases as stand-alones. It causes less stress and it helps me enjoy the game. Cave is releasing these games so that they can hopefully bring in thousands of new fans instead of pleasing a handful of grumpy elitists. They need to continue going this route.DoDonPachi Resurrection is a fantastic package offering up numerous modes of play that I still need time to explore. Each mode brings different dynamics that require the player to put in more time to master. Patterns are different, ships are different, scoring mechanics are different, speed is different. You're basically getting thousands of dollars of arcade games in one neat bundle for around $26 (during the sale).You've got fantastic art direction with all the designs of the enemies, backgrounds, player's ships, bullet spreads, sparkly bonus items, and debris/explosion. Every thing is just a joy to behold while playing the game. It's pretty destracting, but in a good way. I'll end up losing concentration and getting destroyed because I just want to take the time and enjoy the hard work that went into creating these wonderful designs.Music and sound design are also top notch. The music helps me focus while the sounds from attacks and explosions help me feel like I'm an unstoppable force of complete annihilation.Technically this game does have it's issues in terms of a boss disappearing on stage 5 of BLA and some unwarranted slowdown (this I don't care about because I never played the original releases and could care less). But if you've bought products from Degica before they are quick to release patches. Hell, they've already released 3 patches since the game's release YESTERDAY. Even on just now as of writing this to fix the sound tracks. When you buy from Degica you know you're going to get support for your software. Unlike other companies like Koei Tecmo.If you're hesitant about buying this game don't be. Don't listen to the elitists. They are just angry people who don't want others to enjoy a different version of their precious games. Hopefully Cave releases something brand new on this platform so they can argue about nothing."
,Recommended,464450,31559249,Posted: 5 May,all,Misery,"First of all, I'd just like to state that I freaking ADORE this game (and I've played this soooooooo much more than my hours here show, over the course of years, via other versions).  As those who know me are surely aware of, I've played about 80 squillion shmups, usually of the bullet hell style, and I tend to favor Cave's games over most others.  As far as I'm concerned, THIS is the greatest of them all. Period. This is, probably, the single highest bit of praise I could ever give to a game.  However, I'm still going to review this in a more objective way, and some of this WILL sound negative.Dodonpachi is a long-running bullet-hell series, which tends to showcase very well the excitement and absurd levels of challenge of the genre.  Simple idea that any shmup fan is used to:  5 stages, a nasty boss at the end of each.... try not to die.  Preferrably, try to score high in the process of continuing to not be dead.   Also like most games of this type, the difficulty can be extremely brutal.  Bullet hell games are famous for their insane difficulty, with 10 squillion glowing death balls flying all over the screen at once in different directions from a ton of different sources.  When I see a new player going at this type of game for the first time, the reaction is usually ""OMG WTF WTF WTF"" along with lots of random flailing, bombing, and dying.  A bloody miracle if they beat a boss without getting melted.  That's just how this genre goes.This game, however, is by far one of the more approachable (in it's main mode... I'll get to that later).  The game features ""hyper mode"", a state you can enter whenever the meter for it fills.  While in hyper mode, your shots will CANCEL enemy bullets, turning them into stars that then earn you tons of points, and raising your combo meter.  Aside from being buckets of fun to do (I love ""cancel"" mechanics in these), this also gives newer players a way out of bad situations.  Things getting overwhelming?  Hyper mode!  Of course, using this mode as a panic button usually results in a low score... as you increase in skill, you'll preferrably learn to use it at the times that are best to score high, rather than best to just keep you from dying.  This type of game really is all about DODGING, after all.  But the existence of and focus on this ability means that the game is great for beginners.   The actual difficulty of the enemy patterns, also, isnt THAT hard.  Most other Cave games (and most bullet-hell games) are outright murderous compared to this.  Well, until you reach stage 5, which is a horrid difficulty spike.... you'll see what I mean when you get there.  I hope someone got fired for that.That, however, is just ONE mode, specifically, 1.5.  The game contains EIGHT seperate modes.  Each one uses different scoring systems, mechanics, and can have wildly varying levels of difficulty.  For example, Black Label mode, played with a Strong type ship, and with the meter at the top kept filled (I call it the Pain Meter, because the higher it is, the more berserk the patterns get), the difficulty is outright absurd; the patterns are insane, the bullets start to resist cancelling, they cancel into MORE bullets which then also resist, and all sorts of crazy stuff happens.  Or there's something like Arrange B, a mode with a whole different idea, which constantly intensifies the patterns over the course of many runs depending on how you do.  When that mode is getting loopy, it redefines the word ""insanity"".   With so many modes, this game has something for everyone.  Not just in terms of difficulty, but in terms of gameplay styles as well.  There is even a mode often called ""Ketsupachi"", which combines this with the scoring mechanic of one of Cave's best games, Ketsui, and also has you piloting the helicopter from that game instead of the usual ship.  It's like a love letter to the fans, and it is brilliant.   It'd take a LONG time to explain every mode whatsoever... just know that there's quite alot here.Overall, fans of the genre are going to find so very, very much to love here.  Of course, this game being what it is, if you DONT like playing games for score, you're definitely going to get much less out of it.  Most shmups are designed from the ground up for score-based play (as such, Score Attack is where you'll want to be most of the time, regardless of mode).  This also means no continues.  You have the option to play with continues if you want, usually for starting out and learning the game, but when in Score Attack, you wont have any, and that's probably best... a game like this isnt ACTUALLY beaten until you can do it without continuing.  And even then, chances are, there's still probably more to it, like a second loop and some sort of ultimate hell boss.  Fortunately those arent required for victory, and only the most hardcore of players will ever see them.  For normal play, there's no need to worry about them (and some modes dont have either).   Also know that even though this game is ""approachable"", newer players are still probably going to die alot.  Expect some possible frustration.Onto the bad stuff.  There are two main issues that I see with the game.  First:  The replay system is utterly and completely broken.  Dont even bother with it, because much of the time, it doesnt work at all.  Oh, it'll save your replay.  But when you go to play it again, there's a good chance that partway through, it'll ""desync"", and you'll start seeing your ship do things you didnt actually do, smacking into things at random and running out of lives, not showing what ACTUALLY happened at all.   Secondly, there's the slowdown.  As a rule these games have slowdown when there are too many bullets on screen.  It's rather expected with games from the arcade, and in other ports, they do a good job of replicating it properly.  But THIS version screws it up all over the place.  For those players that learned the game through a different version, this can be a huge problem.  Not to mention that some things that were never in the original arcade version are balanced around the original type of slowdown.  They can break down quite hard in this version.  I see it most often in Arrange B, where patterns with a kersquillion tiny shots that previously were slow moving are flung at the speed of sound.  Or other spots may have funky ""micro slowdown"" in odd spots, creating wonky jittering effects.  This all can differ from one PC to the next, I hear.  But even on an ultra high-end machine, you're going to get some weirdness.  I dont think this detracts from the game as a whole, but it's definitely something that needed to be mentioned.   There are a few other issues with the port, but they're much more minor than these.And of course, this has a mean learning curve... ""approachable' is relative to the rest of the genre (and again only in specific modes).  This is for players that are after a true challenge, for those that get satisfaction out of improving their skill and overcoming great difficulty.   So... definitely not for everyone.  And as always with this genre, dont expect a story here.But if this is your type of game, well... yeah.  As I said, there's no higher recommendation I can give.  And really, I could rant about this game for pages and pages.  If you like bullet-hell games, do yourself a favor and grab this one right away.  They really dont get better than this, in my opinion."

Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter.That being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.Still, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty."
,Recommended,464450,26023347,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,filteredRays,"Before you question the purchase price, consider that the game comes several different and previously-unreleased game modes, including Black Label mode, both of which are things that Cave could have sold separately as DLC.Resurrection is one of my favorite shoot 'em ups of all time, so my review will be a bit biased here. I've only played the 360 version at conventions and rarely at friends houses in the past, so to have the game to play whenever I like is a boon. I've only ran through the game once, but it plays fantastically-- 60fps with no lag (other than the pre-programmed lag that Cave puts in, which is totally acceptable.)For those that have never played a Cave shmup before, or for those that aren't into the shmup genre as a whole, I don't really know if I'd recommend it. But for someone that's either a shmup fan or looking to get into it, this is a great place to start-- the music is memorable and addictive, the game as a whole is challenging but not COMPLETELY impossible, and the game is much-better built on launch than Mushihimesama was when it first came out.Now to grind until I can face Hibachi.EDIT: If you're having trouble getting used to the Z/X/C/V four-button setup that is the default with the keyboard, try rebinding V to the spacebar. Using space to hit hypers is a lot easier if you're more used to the Touhou style of ""holding in one button for constant fire and holding in another to focus your fire & slow down movements"" like I am.EDIT 2: This initial review was written before the details of the soundtrack being free DLC for the first week were announced. Because of that, I've retracted that part of the review."

76561198086287768,Recommended,464450,26630101,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,NIH,"This review has been written after getting a successful 1cc (one credit clear, 2-all), and playing all the modes available several times.The TL;DR:If you like shmups, and can handle a fair amount of frustration, this game might be right up your alley. In case one or the other does not apply to you: You may be better off picking up a another title. If you're still interested, but don't want to read the following wall-of-text, feel free to have a look at the summary at the end of this review.The more detailed part of this review:DoDonPachi Resurrection is a rather comprehensive package in terms of playable modes, and playstyles.The game's ""flagship modes""are the ""core"" DDP resurrection and its ""black label"" offspring, each one of which featuring a novice difficulty, so you can get a taste of the action without immediately choking on the spices.You can choose from three different ships and three different ""styles""for the flagship modes, which makes for 9 playable ""subclasses"", all of which require a certain approach in order to perfom well.  So there's quite a bit of replayability to be had already, and it allows players to find something they feel comfortable with. On top of that, the additional ""arrange"" modes offer additional variety.The stagesare nicely detailed with very exacting enemy positioning to keep you on your toes. Every stage features a mid-boss as well. Whatever stage you're playing, they feel handcrafted. It is worth noting that the exacting enemy positioning can be overwhelming for less inclined players.The bossesare unique and vary greatly in difficulty. From the ""yeah, I can do that just fine"" stage one boss, to the ""how am I supposed to win"" true last boss there is a little something for everybody. However, in order to get a 1cc you will need to practice each one for consistancy.The loops and routesadd another layer of complexity to this game. For a 2-all you're required to clear the game twice in a row on one credit. Additionally, the game features two seperate routes through its stages, each route having its own mid-boss as well. The alternative route is relatively easy to get into, but staying in it gets progressively harder. Newcomers will find themselves sticking to the ""normal"" route for quite a bit of time, before they can handle the secret route consistantly enough.The scoring systemin the flagship modes is the traditional DoDonPachi combo system, which requires you to build a ""kill-combo-chain"" throughout each stage for maximum scoring. It is also a very unforgiving scoring system, because even a small mistake can cost you an entire scoring run, when you find your chain being reset to zero. If you're anything like me, you will want to try pushing your score after getting comfortable with the game, and this is where frustration can quickly set in. This game asks a lot of you, if you want to score somewhat properly, and at times it might seem as if the game does not respect your time when it drops your chain and you can't do anything about it anymore, because you messed up something along the way.The training modeis the most comprehensive and customizable one of any CAVE game I have seen here on steam to this point. Routes, loops, midbosses and bosses can all be selected in the training mode, which is as close to ""savestate-practice"" as you can possibly get, though you will find yourself doing things you don't want to practice many times over, just to get to the one particular spot that you have issues with. Nevertheless, if you're anything like me, this is where you will spend most of your time, and once you've figured out what's what in terms of options available, it becomes a nice tool.The O.S.Tis killer, and it's available as DLC as well. It is so good that the DLC was an instant purchase for me. No regrets.If you want to get started with this gameyou will simply have to accept thatit does not come with a manual. As is par for the course for CAVE, they simply can't be bothered to explain even the most basic mechanics of this game in any way shape or form. Not even a lousy .pdf covering the most basic mechanics. If you want to learn how scoring works, or what the ""hyper-mode"" can and can't do while performing certain shot-types, your best friend is your search engine of choice. In short: No manual, no tutorial, nothing at all.The summary+Lots of replayability+Different ship types and styles+Nicely designed stages+Unique boss encounters+Great OST+/- Comprehensive training mode, unfortunately poorly explained-Not necessarily accessible for newcomers-punishing scoring system-No manual, no tutorial"

At first glance, since I have never been a die hard CAVE fan, but love smhups and only a casual gamer, it seems it glitches out. But after some discussion with others who know why its there it puts things in perspective. There are a few different styles of game, so at first its a little hard to take all in. But give it a chance, personally i prefer Novice Blacklabel. I find if i shoot a certain way it makes everything move slower, I've still not really gotten my head around it, but it does make it easier and funner. Because dying isnt fun. I'm not a 1CC kind of dude in bullet hell games, nor am I really sure what TATE even means. I will not being learning Japanese to understand Touhou. $33CAD for a game that I will not get heavily into is almost not worth it to someone like me. But I can say its a great addition to anyone who has any interest at all in shmups. But I do find there are some really die hard fans out there ready to clear up any confusion you have with this game. It has a certain amount of deep strategy in it. There have already been a few minor updates that have seemed to make it a little more enjoyable, so its not abandonware out of the gate. Its fun, easy and enjoyable to pick up for a few minutes at a time or hours on end if you are that way."
,Recommended,464450,30642260,Posted: 20 March,all,Purps™,"Yes, it's finally a version of DoDonPachi Daifukkatsu that you can easily purchase and have work and be more or less playable and no, the port isn't a perfect 1:1 of the arcade/xbox version - particularly in terms of slowdown. To be specific, slowdown had to be emulated for PCs since hardware is different across systems where the Xbox could throttle the processor until it more or less matches the arcade performance. This causes a few issues, but my biggest problem with it is that situations where I'd expect slowdown to ease in/ease out the transition can be almost instantaneous, so in some situations you're slow-mo weaving through bullets and then suddenly the game's back at regular speed and you're dead or farting out one of your autobombs. Not a good feeling, but you can still play around it.So if you want the best way to play it, this probably isn't it - that's the Xbox version. But if you just want to finally be able to play it because you can't or don't want to spring for the Xbox version for any reason, it's perfectly acceptable."

DoDonpachi Resurrection (Daifukkatsu) is the 5th game in the DoDonpachi line and in it you play as 1 of 3 futuristic jets in a vertical shooter to destroy an enemy army who are lead by giantess flying loli.   DoDonpachi Resurrection is filled with nice looking sprites which have great animation that crowd the screen with an insane amount of bullets to dodge.  The music is pretty pumping and the flashing particles make you feel like you're on the dance floor.  I can't stress enough how much action you get out of this title.But, with all this there is a down side.  For the price you get 5 stages to play.  Sure you can play the 5 stages remixed 8 ways, with different difficulties and enemy/visual arrangement, but it's mostly the exact same.  So the way I see it you're paying $5 per stage and a stage maybe takes wo and a half minutes to beat.  That's pretty poor mileage!  In contrast the game for cellphone in Japan is $17.   I don't feel you get a good deal with this so here's what I'm going to tell you:  These Cave titles go on sale for something like $9.99 a few months in, so unless you make bank or have low living expenses wait a little bit until this seems like a good investment.I'm still recommending it though since it's a good game."

Thanks Degica for bringing this game and all of the versions, especially Black Label, hope to see more games from Cave, maybe SaiDaiOuJou? Anyway if you're familiar with the DoDonPachi series, then this should be familiar to you.There are several modes of play:Version 1.5 and novice mode which is the original arcade game, novice being easier for newcomers to the genre.Version 1.51 which is generally the same, but on 1 loop and with different scoring mechanics.Arrange B which is almost like a score attack mode on a single stage, going for the highest score.Arrange A which has only one playable ship, Type-A from DaiOuJou/Blissful Death, with the hyper mechanic altered a bit, and a different scoring mechanics.Black Label, and novice which is a much difficult and updated version of the game with new mechanics. I personally try novice mode first before you experience true hell.Finally their's an Arranged version of Black Label featuring the Ketsui fighter, same as Black Label, but with scoring mechanics from Ketsui, and an alternate true final boss, if you can make it to it.Now, a major problem I here with the game is slowdown. To be honest, this is mostly intentional. I check the game and the FPS stays at 60 even when it slows down, probably to give you a fair chance is theirs a lot of bullets/sprites on the screen, and to emulate the arcade. It's not really that much of a problem if it's not constant, but their is a problem with it in Black Label Arrange. The game does run smooth during the stage, but it has a habit to slowdown during an entire boss fight, and yes it says it's running at 60 FPS. I think it might have something to do with the lock on mechanic with the bullets coming out of the little ships around your fighter that cause the fight to slowdown, and I've seen this mode run smoothly from videos online featuring this mode, and I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this problem or not. I hope Degica will sort this problem out, I'd like my boss battles to run smooth, especially on HIVAC. (Evacaneer Doom) There are a few bugs I've experienced like the game freezing a couple of seconds after destroying an enemy and when a midboss is about to appear, but most have been fixed since Degica has been on hand patching the game with updates and encouraging feedback, so if there is any problem, they should be able to fix it. I recommend this game for all fans of SHMUPs, both veterans and especially newcomers with the novice mode to help get their feet a little wet in one of the greatest shoot em up series out on Steam, from the greatest developer of the genre.*Update* I should mentioned that they've been updating the game, fixing bugs. They've also fixed the problem I addressed in BL Arrange where there's excessive slowdown on 11/18/2016. So this shows that Degica and Cave are listening to all the problems the community has announced, and went out and fix them. In this game's state now, I would now highly reccomend it to any fan of Cave or shmups."
,Recommended,464450,26447882,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,Velka,"This review is only for usage by earthlings!DoDonPachi is one of CAVE Interactive's first games, and it seems to be upheld as a classic in bullet hells. But is this just some weeaboo, overhyped trash, or does DoDonPachi still hold up to its reputation after all these years?Note: DoDonPachi: Resurrection is 29.99 USD because it features both the base game, the ""Special"" edition, and Black Label. These are older/newer versions of the game that play out differently.GameplayGameplay, as you'd expect, is in standard bullet hell fashion. The basics are simple, you play as a ship that flies through an auto-scrolling battlefield while dodging and dishing out walls of bullets. What makes DoDonPachi unique is its switch system between fire types. You have normal bullets/missiles, and then you have the beam. The high-powered beam, also known and to be referred to as, The Laser, is a powerful beam of energy that slows your ship down exponentially, doing heavy damage to anything in its radius... but more importantly, it also deflects enemy lasers as well, which is very important when fighting enemies with powerful, slow moving laser projectiles. This mechanic is fairly well placed into the game, never feeling unnecessarily overused or infrequent.Your normal bullets/missiles do the job just as well though, minus the laser clearing part, and for the most part, everything feels nice. From being a badass and having a standoff with another laser enemy (think Dragon Ball Z but with aircraft) to blowing up entire stations of turrets and wiring, you'll never get bored. You also get a real arcade-y sense from the game, which makes sense considering its an arcade port.StoryThe story is a bit hard to describe without spoiling, but it takes place after the events of DoDonPachi: DaiOuJou, and (in)directly follows on. It's nothing particularly special but it's got a nice twist and multiple endings, if you're that kind of player. Weirdo.GraphicsDespite being an arcade port, the game still looks absolutely beautiful. Everything looks nice and is wonderfully animated, especially the Elemental Doll bosses, who transform on-the-fly and jitter as they take damage. It's certainly outdated looking, but damn if it isn't still mesmerizing to watch some of the backgrounds and enemies.OverallDefinitely a bullet hell worth your price. Not some indie game pretending to be the real thing or a shoddily made gamemaker file, this is the quality stuff you've wanted if you're a schump player. Recommended if you like this kind of stuff.Shotia is the best, by the way. Just saying."

I'm getting a refund for the title but may buy again later once issues are resolved.* The game is unplayable due to dropped frames.  My system is well above minimum system requirements, but the game's framerate momentarily dips into the teens.  I'm not referring to the intentional slowdown that occurs when there is lots of action on the screen.  The framerate issues aren't limited to the gameplay, they happen even when it's just the main menu up on the screen.  I also own Mushihimesama, which isn't affected.* The game includes display rotation, but the main menu positioning is incorrect (its drawn off-screen and can't be seen).  This gives the impression that no one fully tested these core game display settings before release.* Minor point, but the game launches in Japanese on my en_us system.  It could just check my system locale and language preferences, but doesn't.  It is an easy fix and I shouldn't have to think about this.Right now, I can't recommend this title, even to dedicated fans of the series.  If you're tempted, I would encourage you to keep an eye on the discussions around this port before purchasing.--Edited to clarify that the slowdown I'm seeing isn't related to the intentional slowdown in the game as this created some confusion with one reader."

,Not Recommended,464450,30461588,Posted: 11 March,all,Ted Kaczynski,"Dodonpachi is an anime game that has been constantly recommended to me by a few friends. Dodonpachi this, dodonpachi that; they'd rant and rave about how long they've waited to play this game. So when the time came and the game was finally finished, I purchased it.Does it live up to the hype? Read on, fellow gamer.If you're unfamiliar with games like dodonpachi, it is what is called a ""galaga"" style game. Galaga was a commodore 64 game that was very popular in the early 90s, if you are old enough to remember. The objective is to survive long enough while an onslaught of aliens slowly crept up in front of you all the while you try to kill them with your lasers. Obviously, dodonpachi has better graphics, and a japanimation style, but unfortunately not without problems.I own a very nice 50"" 4k HDTV and I'm used to being treated to masterpieces like Watch Dogs 2 and Horizon: Zero Dawn, so when I first started up dodonpachi I was expecting comparable graphics. For a game that was made in 2016, it unfortunately disappoints. CAVE (the creators of this game) try to fool you into thinking it is a 4k game by filling the screen with hand drawn oriental cartoon art (me so sneaky!). Unfortunately, the actual play area is confined to an oddly shaped area in the center of the screen. I really don't get it, you've got all this room and you can't figure out a way to use it? Anyway, to top this off I spotted many jaggies and pixelation so the 3D rendering engine must have some bugs or they're not using much anti-aliasing. The 2d inspired graphics look nice, but are far inferior stylistically to the indie artgame masterpieces such as ""brink"" and ""fez"".The story is underdeveloped (or perhaps abstruse to the ""gweilo"" mind?) and I don't understand it. There are no cutscenes or anything to explain it. Instead you are thrown directly into thousands of bullets without a why or a what-for. No effort is made to tell you why they are shooting at you, why you are shooting at them, and the story behind it. I felt sort of guilty slaughtering so many enemies without knowing if they were russian or something first. There was no philosophical underpinning- no exploration of deep themes in seminal art games such as gone home or the stanley parable. You have no choices in the game that unlock different endings. You just shoot from your little spaceship, and get to the ending 20 minutes later. Is this really an acceptable level of content?The gameplay is slightly more redeeming. You pilot a ship in a 2d plane of movement. This allows you to move along a y axis unlike previous galaga style games, squaring the possibilities. As this was designed for PC (us master race, right? seriously, check out /r/pcmasterrace on reddit), it was built for a keyboard and mouse, allowing great precision compared to, say, a controller, or arcade stick for this style of retrogame. However, my mouse must not have been set up correctly as it did nothing considering this is a pc game. I think you are able to change the yaw or elevation of your craft with your mouse, but I could just not get it working. I use a razer chroma deathadder, as a hardcore gamer and e-sports enthusiast, and perhaps it had too many DPIs for the primitive engine of this game.As far as soundtracks go, it is surprisingly quite good. The music fits the levels, and seems to be a form of japanese dubstep. It has a lot of synthesizers, like an 80s style song. It has not caught up to electronic music on the level of skrillex, but for a videogame, it does not disappoint and is great ambient noise for your space battles against the large robot schoolgirl bosses with anime powers (which were a bit offputting, objectifying, a bit misogynistic, and made me sexually uncomfortable, but I can forgive the cultural gap).Anyway, I easily completed the game in 20 minutes on my first attempt. Besides promising gameplay this is just not the kind of thing for hardcore gamers such as myself. Although it has much artificial difficulty like a game such as dark souls where you constantly die, you immediately are revived by pressing 'continue' right where you left off, making all those deaths pointless, and even rewarded by the game! There are no checkpoints and you just continue indefinitely until you reach the final boss. Where are the alternative endings, or replay value? Where is the extra content that rewards skilled players? Something like a secret level or boss after you beat the game would have been nice, but make no mistake- this is a credit feeder for sure- much like the old arcade games that preceded it. In addition, there is no online multiplayer besides a primitive arcade-style leaderboard for those who try to play the mathematics minigame that gives you higher scores by increasing the numbers on your screen. I barely passed algebra 2 in highschool, and am a sociology major, so I don't find mathematical puzzles in my games to be worthwhile or exciting to pursue. Sadly, I am not a japanese math PhD that can do integrationals and sign/co-sign, and this kind a of contrived form of difficulty is not for me.All in all - Dodonpachi? More like dodonpasse. Super Nintendo quality games just don't live up to their contemporaries anymore, and it's time to change. Maybe CAVE should start making mobile phone games, or arcade games, instead. When I am on my pc or console, I want a game to deliver. I want fast paced action oriented multiplayer of a game like overwatch or call of duty, not slow old primitve ones such as quake or unreal tournament. I want the cinematic cutscenes and story of something like watch dogs or jordan peele's postmodern masterpiece ""get out"", not planetscape: tormentor or those black and white snoozefests by that old fat italian guy (felloni? fullani? I can't remember). Some things are better off left in the past. It's time for the japanese to come out of hiding in their caves and accept they lost the war- the videogame war- and incorporate western technology and engrossing stories into their AAA titles.Overall, I give dodonpachi 7/10 gameplay, 6/10 soundtrack, and 3/10 hardcores, for a cumulative score of 5.85.
