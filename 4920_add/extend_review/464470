,Recommended,464470,23930484,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,Ciunay_Ragathol,"Very good game, already enjoyable in Early Access.Pros:- The most important feature: ""Player Shadows"" for PvP. If you are scared about empty games... DON'T WORRY! If you don't find players, you are matched against player clones who simulate that player fighting style.- Much depth. There is endless longevity to improve your gear by farming, crafting, or by opening chests with retrieved keys or golds, not to say if you like PvP (and PvP rewards), which is the real endgame. As usual, item rarity is divided in trash (gray), common (green), rare (blue), legendary (orange) and epic (purple).The paperdoll is well done, accurated under every aspect. You can level up each character, unlock and upgrade their abilities; however, the quickbars have limited slots in order to prevent an easy use of them all, so you have to choose. The appearance changes as well, based on equipped items.- High quality. Decent graphics, beautiful UI, smooth animations, nice sound effects. Personally i didn't see a single bug; it's well polished.- Skill based. The faster you are on connecting more runes as possible, the more damage you inflict, but it's not just simple spamming, as rune elements count: they charge powerful spells of the same element that hits harder against opponent vulnerabilities (fire, water, etc...), or adds effects (e.g. freeze); also, runes combined in circle increase your defense, and there are spells and potions to heal/defend yourself.- EU, US, Asia, Australia, Japan servers.Cons:- May be a little repetitive in PvE, especially because of monsters, but it's much more fun in PvP.At the end what can i say? It's like ""Puzzle Quest"". Certainly worth more than the current price (8,99 bucks), so skip it just if you don't like RPGs and/or tetris genre."

,Recommended,464470,24070805,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Sutehx,"I saw this game recommended around and gave the reviews here on Steam a look. I saw a fair number of positive reviews talking about how it was a fun spin on Match 3. That the addition of loot, levelling, and other RPG elements gave it some good replayability.I also saw reviews saying the loot was way too random, the game too stingy with gold, and that it was super grindy. This gave me pause as its clearly a phone game brought over to Steam as is and those are often just thrown onto the store with all their weird former F2P buttons and grind still hanging around. I bought it anyway because I love me some Match 3 and it was on a generous sale.The very first thing I see after the prologue is an ingame mail letting me know the game had been updated mere hours ago tweaking gold income and loot chances upward. That they're not only taking that feedback in but bettering the game using it is super commendable.As far as the actual gameplay goes, it's in the vein of Puzzle Quest where you match gems to fill and cast spells that correspond to the matched color, which is my favorite kind of Match 3. The addition of a loot chase on top of that complete with salvaging and upgrading and a multiplayer arena has me wanting to stay up later than I should playing more."

However, there is no real depth to it. The ""challenge"" of the game is not really a skill based at all, but is instead left to total chance.Case in point, it's nearly impossible to finish the first world without getting a lucky roll for gear.  So you are left grinding and grinding and grinding, hoping for a lucky roll on a random gear generator.After a three hours of this, I got tired of it.  The drop rates are way too low and the game loses its fun after a short time. So it's not worth buying this game, as the actual gameplay is severely limited.  You'd be better of playing a free flash game for the same effect.The fun lasts about as long."

I can only speculate that the silence is due to the many people asking for a way to reset the character, and noting the imbalance issues. That's right, you can't start a new game with a new build. Ever. What a shame, this game could have been something. Oh well. My review stands.The game is fun... until you reach a point where you constantly have to go back and grind to level up. Don't worry though, the developers have a ""how to avoid the grind"" sticky on the forum. *eyeroll*See, the problem is that when you select your spells initially, you have no idea what's coming. So, you level up a spell, and the entire first area of the game has enemies that are weak to a spell... that you didn't level up. No problem, right? So you level up a bunch, now you have the right spell, and.... damn, you still suck.So you go and craft some stuff, unlock chests via keys, complete some daily challenges, have a bunch of gold to go upgrade some more stuff.... and UH OH, you still need to go back to grind out levels in dungeons you've completed to then go back and try to beat the boss that should have been beaten about 3 hours ago.I love hard games. Check my library. This? This isn't hard. It's tedious, with zero sense of progression and a grind that amounts to a +(insert number here) damage bonus that just doesn't quite justify beating up the same easy enemies over and over again.But hey, don't take my word for it. The developers have a guide up on ""how to avoid the grind"".....Balance your game and I'll change my review."

76561198034212365,Not Recommended,464470,24536281,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,sepruecom,"An interesting game, though it has a lot of issues. The main ones are- max Level 40This is especially important for leveling. You will only get 20 Points to level up your skills (the other 20 are for unlocking them). After that you need to collect gold, lots of it, especially for the high category skills, where a level can easily cost a 6 digit number- duelingFirst problem: Most duels are ""bot duels"", you fight against the char of your opponent, which is controlled by a ""bot"". It clearly has issues with some of the configurations players use, making them lose fights they shouldn'tSecond problem: Pairing. You get paired to people with a similar over-all ""power score"", which is calculated by level, gear and equipped spells. The problem with this system isa.)the score of all three characters is taken into consideration, though only 2 can ever fight. This makes it unfair for people who have all their three chars skilled and equipped, since they will be paired with people of much stronger 2-chars.b.)power gamers. Leaving the third (unused) char un-equipped is almost normal. However there are numerous players who only have one char equipped and skilled. Their one main char is much stronger than the normal char from a 2-chars or 3-chars player, and will pretty often win.And last but not leastthe scoring. You will receive points if you win a fight, which you need to enter (or lose) the various leagues. The league you are in determines the rewards you get at the end of the week. The scoring system however is pretty messed up and not really understandible:a.)Your all-over level and the items on your char as well as your oponent's score seem to determine the points you can achieve. If you win, you will get a minimum of 10 points (5 if you lose one char), there seems to be no maximum (got 50 points sometimes). If you lose, you can lose 0 (if you are lucky) or (my record) 52. That's akin to 6 won fights. Given the fact that there are these ""Power-gamer 1-char-skilled"" players you will pretty sure lose against those from time to time. If they have an overall lower power score, you will lose points. Lots of them, killing the result of 4-6 ""regular"" won fights. Sometimes you will also receive lots of points if you win, however I could not detect any algorithm behind that. It seems to be benevolent to fight people with higher power score, but even that does not really help all the times.b.)If you are fought as a bot, you will lose points if you lose (which is OK). However, you will never get any points if you win (which is not OK). This is a constant source of points drain in the game. Of course, you mostly don't lose more than 1-5 points, but it still sums up over the course of the week.For SP, some people mentioned the grind it sometimes takes. However if you are lucky with your keys, this can be diminished to a minimumSo what do I expect to give a good review:- better duel pairing- more understandible rank scoring- less points lost at a lost fight"

If the matchmaking system places me vs 14lvls lower opponent, then I would rather play against a shadowbot (so does he i can imagine :P)... heck even 5 lvls make a big difference here...B. If i have 3 heroes with 1,5k rating each - why am i getting placed vs dude who has a 3k hero and around 1k spread on his other toons (or better - they are stripped out of clothes so overal rating gets lower)... This 3k dude will obviously murder my duo in seconds... and i can't rly hurt him... (only heroes taking part in fight - yes those 2 out of 3 that I picked - should matter when i search for a fair match)C. Shadowbots can have higher lvls but only after above points get fixed...

Great game, obviously a mobile port as u can see the microtransaction functionallity but once u reach 40 it doesnt even matter anymore cause your gear is OP and since its mostly lucky base a battle is dependant on 3 things, critical, dodge and health.

You could spend 50000 gold easily (chest opening is 1500) and not get a single damn item that is an UPGRADE for the hero that needs it.  Even upgrading your gear is at the whim of random since you can't guarantee an even ""disassembly"" of materials (I'm always low on Light/water) and there is no way to get more without getting more items.  At some point it becomes redundant and basically ruins the game as you end up stuck.  The monsters don't scale well at all either.  The game goes from ""ok this is how it works"" to getting one shot too quickly.  Around the lvl 18-20 mark things just get......too difficult and become less fun.Granted I WILL still play this since I bought it.....but as things stand right now I honestly cannot say I'd recommend it to friends.

It IS server dependant, but after telling their playerbase about the server shutdown, the devs disapeared again, and made no moves to make the game not server dependant, so fans could still play the SP campaign w/o the online PvP/Arena component.

So it goes from a Positive review to a Negative review. With a warning to others to get the names of these devvs before they erase what little info remains online about them. So you can keep an eye out for them and AVOID any new projects or offerings they put out.Game development is NOT where these charlatans belong."

It goes a bit deeper than though though as you have RPG character types along with equipment and you can tag out characters as well in a fight game mannerism like MvC style. Now on top of all that enemies have certain weaknesses you can exploit based around the gem icons and you have 5 abilities slots that do various things offensively and defensively based on your character plus potions. It also has crafting as well and some quests. Plus it's got pvp with a ranked leadership board which can't hurt I guess why not right. Oddly all of that and it's only a early access game bravo Outsmart."

Why did they not just write an offline patch for this game?  I was loving this game and I find it most annoying that the developers are well known for bringing out early access games and getting as much money off players as they can then they close shop and move on.  It is very wrong of them to say that they failed to raise enough funds from the game as the game itself was developing a cult following and as such 'we' the gamers would have happily co-funded the games development!

The gameplay is smooth and the combat is fast paced. However the scaling of the fights is a little rediculous. I chose to be a stalker class, who is weak to iron and strong in nature. well the first 2 areas are riddled with strong iron type monsters. Im not sure if this changes accustom to what charecter you play but i dont think it is. This causes you to stop using your ability tokens and upgrade tokens and crafting on YOUR charecter and start focusing on the side charectrs that will stop being useful as soon as you get passed the difficult area. Before i reached the boss of the first area, i was able to sweep through every level with just my charecter, i didnt need my side charecters, so i had to go back and grind out levels so that i could beat the first boss. regardless this is a very minor problem, i still had alot of fun, and will continue to play this game until i 100% it"
