So it's a thumbs down just for now at this priceOnce I get multiplayer to work and try that I will reassess but for now be warned that you do not get much for your moneyMy video covers most of what the game has to offer so far

This is for the first version available for the public.Good things:The game concept is great.The physics are fun and weird.The graphics are really friendly.Bad things:Not much to build with.Only sanbox and no mini missions or such to do.15€  is a little much for the game right now. (Now only 6€)But all in all i do recommend the game for poeple who has money laying round."

And ive earleady gotten 4 crashes so far being either on sandbox or in the normal builder.. And you know what? It's terrble.Pro's:Good graphic's.øSmooth fps.Sandbox offers first-person-view, downsides; Cant jump and the animation for using the tools are rather ""meh""-ish.Con's:No instructionsNo toturialsGame crashing too often.Carbuilder is limited resources (blocks)Carbuilder is rather akward getting fast used to.Conclusion:Its a game that needs development and more passion than it is now, but it could be just me not figuring out how to build sh*t, but its probably the editor instead! Anyways, i'd say you shouldnt refund this game, its worth looking into and trying for yourself.Update #1:Added a conclusion, deleted some text and added the text below.Updated 16 Mars 2017"

,Recommended,464690,24181284,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Empathy KING,"Before you buy this game please understand the ""early access"" version is extremely limited and when I say extremely I mean bare bones. So far all you can do is build a very basic car and thats it. I have yet been able to actually see any of my creations ""come to life"". I have only played this game for about 20min, but in that 20min I experienced everything that ""early access"" Vroomist has to offer. I built a total of 4 very basic cars and out of those 4 cars I did not get one to successfully ""run"". As soon as I hit the simulate button the game either crashed or my car fell to pieces. You only get about 10 or more parts to fool around with. One part being an engine and 2 other parts acting as 2 different size wheels. The other parts are one single block a couple of offensive and deffensive parts and a ""socket"" type part. The building system is very user friendly and simple. I was able to pick it up right away without the need of a tutorial (of which there isn't one) and build my first complete car witin about 3 minutes. After that I assumed that I was supposed to click the ""simulate car"" tab and watch my vehicle take off, but unfortunately as I previously stated I was unable to do so. With that said, all that you can do so far in Vroomist is build a very simple non-functioning vehicle and that is it. This is where most gamers will throw their punches and destroy Vroomist in the review and comment sections. Almost $15.00 for a game that barely offers 10 minutes of very minimal and super limited play time is an extremely outrageous price... However the idea is there! If the dev successfully makes his vission of Vroomist a reality... The limits and possibilities of what this game can do are endless!If you do decide to purchase Vroomist in its current condition you will not be buying a game... You will be investing in the devs idea. Now I know that there are a lot of gamers out there who are not into buying ideas. They want games! In my opinion Vroomist can be one of the most fun games I have ever played. Right now everything and anything that has to do with buying this game is based on 100% trust of the developer.I am gonna say this one last time... Please do not buy this game and expect to be building and driving creative vehicles or bots right out of the gate. If you do then you will be extremely dissapointed and very upset. If you do however see the potential that this game has, want to invest in this developers idea and vision and be able to play the game and help the dev build Vroomist from begining to end, then by all means buy Vroomist!  I am not in any way affiliated with the developer. I do not personally know the developer... I jsut really like his vission. In my mind I have wanted a game like this for as long as I can remember. Being able to build and craft your very own ""exploration car/battle bot"" has been something that I promissed myself I would do if I won the lottery. When Minecraft was realeased I played the game hoping that ""bot building"" or ""vehicle building"" of some kind would eventually be implemented. Well I haven't won the lottery and bot building has yet to be introduced into Minecraft. Its like this guy pulled an idea right out of my head... That is why I am acting like  I am about this game. Getting my foot in the door early at the begining and being able to help the dev with suggestions and being able to watch the game progress from the ground up is well worth the asking price if you ask me. The dev has to be able to focus all of his time and attention into the game if he wants to make it a masterpiece. The only way he can do that is to have support from us gamers. The more people invest into Vroomist the more confidence, time and energy the dev can put into the game!I can not wait for this game to progress!  I am so looking forward to all of the very cool vehicles and bots that I will be making to use in exploring and battling friends! If Vroomist seems like a game that you would absolutely love then please support the dev by either buying the ""early access"" version or by simply visiting the devs community hub and leaving some really uplifting compliments and encouragement! I can guarantee that being able to visually see how much the gamers want Vroomist to become a realty will give the dev all kinds of CREATIVE ENERGY!"

It's early access but the developer works hard and will be fixing bugs and updating it with new modes such as survival. It's fun to build a car and then drive it through the map exploring the land. The graphics look great and I can't wait for more updates!

,Recommended,464690,23488200,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,pickapixel,"I bought this game straight away! I couldn't resist! I recorded a video on it and just uploaded the montage to my YouTube channel 'pickapixel'!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0FxE171A4oI had so much FUN! It really did make me laugh, it was certainly challenging though! It was a bit buggy but I expected that with it being in such an early stage of the game! I can't wait to continue following this game from the start and see what it grows into! Especially when multiplayer is fully implemented!To anyone unsure whether or not to get it, if you've got some spare money lying around or saved up then give it a go! if not then perhaps wait until it's developed slightly further! Either way, I really enjoyed my first experience and can't wait to play more and make more videos on it! Nice job! :D"
