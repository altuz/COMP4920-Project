76561198097982686,Recommended,464850,29347882,Posted: 18 January,all,Shadow_Merc,"I bought this game almost half hour after it was released, having only played the demo till then, thinking it would be a pretty straight forward joystick cricket game. Having not played DBC 14, this one shocked me by its level of detail to A.I gameplay. I can't compare it to DBC in terms of graphics or smoothness, but its pretty obvious that it runs on higher specs and is probably why people find it stuttery. The game is challenging, dont expect to get wickets or runs when you feel like it. U can notice the gameplay difference in career mode as you ascend the ladder, even at the easiest settings one has to play smart, no re-load option mid game, if you're out, you're out, better luck next time. A.I mentality is very noticeable, by their reactions to being tired and under confident and vice versa. There's some annoyance with the manual fielding, but cmon, you always reset that to automatic. Overall I'm happy to see a cricket game that isnt just good for he fans, but a good challenging gaming experience for anyone. It took my guy 3 seasons to finally be selected from club cricket level."
76561197976516490,Not Recommended,464850,29317927,Posted: 17 January,all,&The3Bears!,"I, for the life of me, cannot understand why all the reviews are positive so far!I cannot stress enough, this game is a downgrade from Don Bradman Cricket 14!!! It would have been more appropriate for the developers to release this as an early access title considering its current state...Every single aspect of this game, aside from its lofty aspirations, is worse than its predecessor!!When my wife played this game for the first time, she stated ""It's as if they took all the parts of Don Bradman Cricket 14 that needed fixing, failed at fixing them, and then broke every other part of the game while they were at it""...I have never been so disappointed with a $65 (AUD) purchase in my whole life!A few of my favourite issues with this game are:1) The physics – one of the highlights of DBC 14 for me was the realistic way the ball came onto the bat - fast!! DBC 17 has destroyed this feeling, it feels as if the ball is more inflatable beach ball than cricket ball!! This seems partly due to the speed of both the bat and the ball, which are both far too slow to accurately represent the game of cricket... or physics in general!!2) The bowling controls are in fact less dynamic and allow for less control than DBC 14 (While requiring twice as many buttons to be pressed) - instead of controlling the length of the ball with the timing of the thumbstick movements (A great system which actually required skill to bowl the ball where you wanted to), you simply press a button to choose a length, and a modifier to move it foward or backwards a little... meaning there are 12 exact lengths that can be bowled, and no skill is required to achieve the same length delivery ball after ball...3) While the graphics and lighting may in fact be ""improved/running on a better engine"" from the previous version, they do not look better overall - its hard to explain... everything is just too rounded and shiny looking, to the point that IMO, DBC 14 looks better, as it captures depth and shadows better.4) The system for setting fields is massively overcomplicated, as is the UI experience in general!5) There are things wrong with almost every part of this game, fielding, batting, bowling, the UI, the academy... Some of it major, some of it minor, but its guaranteed to annoy the hell out of anyone who enjoys the sport of cricket!!So I will end with this suggestion:- If you are the sort of gamer that is prepared to pay a AAA price for a low-budget indie game, and say things like ""quality doesn't matter, I want to support this developer, regardless of how unfinished their games are"" and ""This game has the potential to be the greatest cricket game of all time!! Who cares if its going to take another 3 years of development to realise this dream!!"" and ""I am happy to spread lies about the quality of this game"" - This is the game for you!!!- If however, like myself, you prefer notions such as ""value for money"", ""honesty"" and ""Calling a spade a spade"", then avoid this game like the plague, as it is unfinished, sh*te, and a complete and utter downgrade from its predecessor!!!"
,Recommended,464850,29341185,Posted: 18 January,all,Dridge118,"Great cricket game.  Many, many additions from DBC14 the big one is Gameplay modifers (sliders).. Much more customisation (bats/logos/stadiums) Already most teams/players and stadiums have already been created by very talented people on PlanetCricket forums. It's basicly a cricket sandbox game, you play it how you want to play it from players/kits/stadiums/match types/pitch conditions/gameplay sliders... With the added academy features shame to see no stump customiseation/ boundry rope ads/ball sponsers/overlays like you could with adding files like modding on DBC14 yet. I hope this could be added in futre updates.Yes the console release of this game was (buggy) to say the least (I have the xbox1 version aswell) but the PC version at the moment is a big improvement with many fixes already applied to this PC version.The graphics are a step up from previous game. Game runs very smooth on my pc at 1440p 144hz (980ti)Bowling is very enjoyable with many differences in edges and delivery types. The bowling hud is much smaller and easier to understand. Batting is very good too. I'm just not as good at batting than bowling :) much more choice in shots i.e advance down the wicket shot now can play along the ground or go in the air. One negitive so far is the CUT shot animation is not very good in my opinion.. I can't remember seeing a cut shot played like that ever. much more precise with shots better controls for shots like precise shots (RB) and such.Commentry is abit odd/repetitive at times but so happy to see James Taylor be apart of the game.Fielding is alittle slow, able to hit and run most times in the circle even when hitting it right to the fielders, ball tracking seems alittle off aswell at times.Few bugs here or there but BA have a very good track record of fixing things very swiftly on the PC and have committed to delivering one of the best cricket games on PC. The game will only improve with many future fixes/updates. I have every faith in them to deliver like they did for DBC14I fully reccomend this game to anyone who likes cricket, It's a very enjoyable game."

The Timing indicator cannot be trusted AT ALL, it will show ideal for terribly timed shots all the time. There have been so many times ive 3 greens and i get caught in the inner circle.2. Your team needs 12 runs in the last over with 6 wickets remaining, why is the AI defending n taking singles ? WHY !!!!3. Why isnt there a variety in bolwing actions . (This is forgivable , but come on... this is a must )4. If i try to  hit the ball on the off side, the default shot should be a off drive or a glance, not a BASEBALL SWING !!  I am tired of balls that go straignt to the keeper , coz the batsman tried to play a shot on the square leg, rather than mid off.5. Ball is pitched on the leg stump line, so i try to play a glance. But then the batsman takes a step away to the offstump, and then glances, missing the ball completely . I never asked for that side step, WHY DID YOU DO THAT< WHYYYY6. I am a spinner, why cant i jump directly to spinner field presets , I dont want to go thought pace / fast bowling fields. Spinner field presets are literally at the bottom of the list . WHY cant i just skip to spinner fielding presets.7. Why cant I save my field setup . I keep a fielder on third man. For some magical reason the game , just goes nope , and moves him away. And now I am a retard bowling on the legside, with noone to save that four.8. During career , why  cant i practice on a practice ground. Net practice doesnt tell you , if your timing is good enough for a six or a four. You need a ground to tell you that.9.  Personal tidbits : a.  I would like to see balls edge and go vertically up .  b. the depth persception straight down the ground, (mid on - off region ) does not feel rite .  c. In career mode, if i am not doing well, in a tournament, i should be dropped for a game or two (it will be realistic ,and i will take my game seriously).Everything good to say about the game ,is basically what was good in Don Bradman 14 . Thats why i am disappointed , coz in 3 years not much has been done in terms of gameplay improvements. Yes the graphics are updated , so is the engine. And the career mode is tweaked . But nothing that justifies 3 years of hiatus.Luckly , all the issues i have stated are just tweaks and can easlisly be patched and added. Nothing that is so game breaking , that it will require a sequel to fix. So I am hopeful , and would appretiate if any of these are aknowledged. But for now I cannot recommend this game in this state. Even though i will be spending hours playing this game."

I'll tell youPros:- Career mode is a big improvment.- Animations are good.- AcademyCons:- Wrong Kits (White kits for ODI and T20s).- Wrong Stats (Displaying First Class, List A, T20 stats for Test, ODI & T20I respectively.- Can't get past the main loading screen.- Randomly crashes.- Have to choose the line up again and again  in career mode.- Stats for international cricket are not available in career mode.- A bug where game gets blurrier.- Umpiring errors.- Graphics are meh.- Commentary will make your ears bleed.- Game is poorly optimized and runs in borderless windowed mode. Game will stutter from time to time on my 1060 and i5 3550 with 8 gigs of RAM.- Max resolution is 1920x1080.Devs don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ if you are having any problem. I was having an online issue in DBC 14 and I contacted the devs and this is what I was told""We are the developer of the game, we are trying to help you out of goodwill - we have no responsibility at all to even answer you"". It's pretty much the same support for this game too. Right now I'm stuck on the main screen and can't get past it. I paid $50 for a game that I can't even play atm.TL;DR: Do not buy this game right now. Tons of bugs and some of them will make the game unplayable. It's not even worth $20."

,Recommended,464850,29307345,Posted: 16 January,all,parthkadakia92,"I have played this game for 3 hours almost straight. I have the Xbox One version as well. There were few issues in the xbox version but let me tell with a big smile, most of them are sorted out for the PC release. This is fantastic and the game is fantastic. There are more stats that pop up like RRR, RR how many runs needed to win, projected score now while playing. This was something users demanded and let me tell you on BigAntStudios listens as a developers. Few shots were missing but now those shots are playable. I played beautiful cover,square drives. There are batsman who run quicker now, the superhuman wicket keeper and fielders have toned down. I will go out and say this is the best cricket game ever and BigAnt have supassed the Don Bradman 14 expectations and set a new bar."
,Recommended,464850,29396410,Posted: 21 January,all,GuyIncognito,"If you come into this game expecting cricket 2K17 or EA Sports Cricket then you will be disappointed, with more games than just this one.What I have found playing so far:Positives1. Batting is challenging and fun. It requires actual timing and skill.2. Bowler AI is much improved over DBC 14 and is constantly changing it up.3. My Career mode, player creation is much improved and offers greater depth.4. Visually better than DBC 14, yes the lighting is different but is more natural. (Grass blades people, grass!)5. Pitch variation: The pitches are much more dynamic this time around. Without saying much, you should pay attention to the pitch report as different bowler types will be more effective than others.6. Getting singles is much easier and more natural this time around, fielders are effective (most of the time - club cricketers are meant to be fairly average =) )7. Ball physics are much enhanced, although there are times where it bounces more than a tennis ball lol.8. Stadium creator is neat, could be a bit more robust but heu - Stadium creator!9. Customisation is quite remarkable from logos, teams, kits etc to setting up your grade league in my career (I reccomend creating a few rural type grounds for this part of the career as the defaults are proper stadiums. I don't recall my local team playing at the MCG lol.)Cons:1. Commentary is pretty bad, and by bad I mean horrendous. Fortunatly, if you mute it, the sound effects and ambience make for quite the relaxing time.2. A few visual bugs that I have encountered: namely, stuttered animations in fielding and replays. Not a biggie as I'm sure this will be fixed later.In Summary:If you like cricket and cricket likes you then DBC 17 is a fine game. Just for the love of god don't expect a 2K or EA game.Two thumbs up."
,Not Recommended,464850,32641017,Posted: 22 June,all,Vercingetorix,"Did you like DBC14? Specifically, did you enjoy the responsive batting controls? Then look elsewhere. If you've ever wondered what it's like to control a plasticine action figure using very underdeveloped powers of telekenesis meaning you can only generally suggest what they should do and hope for the best, this is the game for you! Seriously, this is a straight downgrade from DBC14.The bowling's fine, for the most part, and I like that I can add extra bounce or flight (I've only bowled spin, I didn't care for being a quick in DBC14 and that is yet to change) to my deliveries, but the batting is poor. The amount of times I've gotten out because the batsman and I have alternate interpretations of where a cover drive is supposed to be hit (and I have this issue for other shots, but I seem to experience it the worst when playing off the front foot, though occasionally when attempting a back foot shot, the batsman will just not bother) makes for a very frustrating time.I can understand a game being difficult because it requires skill, DBC14 did that just fine. This has the same level of difficulty, and it adds crummy batting controls on top. If the situation improves, then I will change this review, but until then, I can't reccomend it. Adding grade cricket was a nice touch, and letting me assign skill points like an actual RPG was the right move, but they messed up the gameplay. You know, the bit that makes up 90% of the game."

Batting is difficult but I'm sure more practice will pay off. Fielding is a bit bizarre. Players will sometimes run straight past a ball and leave it for another fielder, costing runs. I find the commentary dull, repetitive and sometimes has nothing to do with what's just happened in the over. Graphically it's very good. Runs smoothly and does the job. Hoping some patches will sort out the fielding out!"

,Not Recommended,464850,30635252,Posted: 20 March,all,warriorsrule,"I have played 3688 hours on Don Bradman Cricket 14 and still love the game. However, Don Bradman Cricket 17 is a big step backwards and the developers have almost ignored all requests from users for new addition / features to the game.Don Bradman Cricket 17 does not even track your earned stats for your created players like Don Bradman Cricket 14 did.Tail enders bat exactly like top or middle order batsman. There is no distinguishing between animations between proper batsman and those tail enders who have poor defensive abilities.The lack of different bowling animations makes the game look very boring in terms of bowling. Even games like Brian Lara Cricket 2005 and Brian Lara Cricket 2007 had different types of animations for bowlers.The new ball will swing as much as a ball that looks worn 70 overs late. There is no similarities between how the ball acts in real life and how it does in the game. Why is this game called a simulation if it does not represent real life?The pitches are not distinguishable. There are no green seamers where the ball moves around off the seam. There is no dusty pitches where the ball spins significantly and creates issues for batsman every ball. I do not understand why there are different looking pitches when they all play exactly the same.Created stadiums look absolutely awful in the game. They look like the crowd are sitting on cardboard boxes. You cannot even create a created stadium with grass embankments with people sitting on grass like some cricket grounds around the world.BigAnt has ignored all the suggestions from fans who bought Don Bradman Cricket 14 and have created a game of what they believe consumers want. This falls short of what we want. Sadly this game is a shadow of Don Bradman Cricket 14 which is still the best Cricket game ever created."

How did they ruin this game?Pros:- More stats- Improved Menu UI- I like on screen UI as I'm bowling- More stuffCons:- Commentary is buggy- I got 2 wickets in an over and complains that I need to tighten up because 8 runs were scored- No mention like in DBC of going into the 30's, 40's, getting my 50- Tells me great hit won't need to run, gets fielded- I could go on and on, but it feels worse then DBC 14- The game looks and feels worse. Glitchy, slow UI, fuzziness at times, DBC14 graphics are a better overall experience- random runs being recorded,I would really like to see the devs at least chip away at issues, i.e regular releases to at least show they care, fix one thing, release that, repeat. It's friggen tumble weed on the update.I got nervous when I saw they were doing bat editor, stadium builder, etc why not focus on making the core actually playable, improved instead of wasting dev time on these secondary features. DBC14 was great, but I feel if you actually listened to your users, and focused on fixing the stuff that was broken, not breaking the stuff that was OK, we would have a much better game.Frustrating as this could have been my favourite game of all time, now I'm just too late to refund and hoping for updates"

The batsman plays the ball to where I had placed a fielder, easy catch for my man....Nope, my fielder has somehow moved between balls from say, cover, and is now stood down at fine leg or somewhere else.Having fielders stood on the boundary, a ball is hit towards them, they stand on the boundary rope and watch the ball go past for 4.Just stupid stuff like this.Hopefully they'll patch it soon and make it playable.

Perhaps it never will be.Graphics - I get why they changed the ball now bounces off rather than ""clips through"" just about everything - but this means getting the ball back to the bowled is a vomit inducing camera spinning dizzying whirwind of throws misses and staring at a still ball in the middle of the pitch. Mostly though the player graphics and animations don't look as good. I miss the muscular chest stretch of DB '14's quick bowlers rather than the ""made out of plastacine left overs"" look the new graphics have. All blobby and like several body parts that aren't co-ordinated with each otherOverthrows. If you have an attacking offside field (which in tests as a pace bowler happens a lot) then a nudge to cover will get the cover fielder to run in like a lunatic, throw the ball at the BASE OF THE STUMPS AS HARD AS HE CAN. The batsman is not looking to take a run, no one is at the stumps to take the ball and because only 2 or 3 fielders are on the on side the ball too often whizzes to the mid wicket boundary at which point the commentator tells me what a good shot it was!!!Quality of life 1. As a batting allrounder I get taken off after 2 over spells often - only to be bought back on 6 overs later and have to re-find my fields in an interface that is a step back (again) from DB '14Quality of life 2. How many clicks to start a game? 1,2,3,4,5,6,7?Quality of life 3. The wait between deliveries has gone up considerably. For some reason the bowler faffs about for a while. The game is for my benefit not hte AI's... GET ON WITH IT a 12 year career playing every game is an 1800 undertaking as it is without this constant dithering.Stuff that's just ""wrong"" Why am I increasing my pace stat when in my first club game I can bowl 145 Kph?  The ball seems to go ""game time"" quicker as you increase this stat, but the speed the game tells you you are bowling never changes.Square cut. I lean back then Towards the ball that is under stump hiugh, push up and left - that's a cover drive not a square cut, but no he steps away (the opposite of what I'm doing on the joypad) and wafts a cross bat square cut that either misses or cuts to gulley and out.There's more but that feels like picking on the game.DB '14 was not the game it ended up being when it was released. However I have seen no new patches for this game and it's been out months so maybe the bad reviews here have scuppered ongoing development.The long and short of it - after 3 years it should have been better than this. The rebounding physics stuff seems a step in the right direction but the presentation, gameplay and quality of life all took a step back and don't look like being fixed.Thumbs down for now - if they fix it I will review that."

This is the same game but with slightly different UI and graphics. I already get shafted by buying the same game every year with FIFA, I don't need it with cricket as well as soccer.I know I've only played half an hour of this on Steam but I've spent days building my career on DBC 14, on Xbox 360 (I know, this review doesn't really sound believeable but I guess you'll have to take my word here).Everything felt EXACTLY the same. No improvement, nothing worse just... exactly the same. DBC 14 was AMAZING because it was a cricket game that actually felt more like a simulation than an arcadey game. Yet, it has its flaws but by god it was the best cricket game BY A MILE. It was remarkable.I had a huge expectations for this and didn't read much into it leading up to buying it. I genuinely believed that Big Ant would take the incredible base they've made with DBC 14 and build on it, getting rid of the little annoying bugs, adding new features (YOU STILL CAN'T SAVE A FIELD SETTING BY THE WAY, ENTER IT MANUALLY EVERY TIME), and making the AI better and the overall gameplay experience. I got none of that.Sorry but I haven't waited 3 years for a disappointment like this. Refund requested. What a let down. Rant over. Apologies to those who read it.TL;DR - Keep playing DBC 14 instead of investing in this tripe."
76561198015006699,Not Recommended,464850,34531797,Posted: 27 August,all,cankercoot,"This game feels like a real step backwards from the previous DB title. It seems like the devs were more focused on delivering a game where you can alter every aspect of your career player's appearance or building your own cricket ground rather than an enjoyable cricket simulation. The difficulty has been ramped up for this iteration (no bad thing as cricket is a very hard game to master). This however has perhaps gone a little too far for back foot shots, as they seem near impossible to perfect. The AI for field settings is much better this time, it feels a bit more reactive and a bit more like the opposition have a 'plan' against you. However the AI for fielders is so bad; random slides, unnecessary throws to bowler's end, peculiar running around the ball, might be a simulation of club (or rather beer match!) cricket, but international fielders do not usually get up to such shenanigans. The commentary is truly awful. Lacklustre voice work that does nothing but sap your immersion in the game rather than bring added colour (if audio can do such a thing!?!) The wicketkeepers exhibit peculiar behaviour, flitting between being incompetant clowns to displaying superhuman athleticism (in one instance dismissing me by having me caught behind with a one handed catch in the position of a second slip, therefore diving fully across the guy at first slip!, to a spin bowler from a fierce back drive).If you want a fun cricket sim buy DB14, for all its flaws its still a superior game. If you want a frustrating and in the end unrewarding cricket sim then you've probably been on the staff for Big Ant and were part of the development team so therefore won't have to buy it. Otherwise don't buy this buggy mess of a game."

Where this game improves in graphics, it falls behind in actual gameplay when compared to the original. Sport games are difficult to get right and making sure its gameplay is genuine before making it look good must be a priority. Big Ant Studios failed big time."

However, if you've never played DB 14, then you might enjoy DB 17.I purchased this game after putting in about 400 hours in DB Cricket 14 expecting much of the same, but better. Which was obviously wrong.Bowling has gotten better; previously I could've bowled 10+ overs in a test match before I saw a wicket. Here the edges are more frequentI like the having to do something to make a catch, however pointless it may seemFielding AI is slightly improved from DB 14, but the whole running away from the ball and making a one handed behind the back catch is sillyBatting experience is awful; just straight up awful compared to DB 14At least in career mode, running that first run after hitting a shot is just slowI like the dynamic line up changes in career modeGraphics for a $50 game is not even close. They spent 3 years developing this?Overall, I'm mixed on this game. I would not recommend it for $50. This is a $30 game at best.However, my main gripe is the batting experience in DB 17. If you've played DB 14, you won't enjoy it here as much as you did in DB 14. Still the occasional game crash at odd times."

Whereas in 14 you could 90% of the time take a quick single knowing that the mechanics would give you enough time to get in.When you update the teams its applies it to your current save game/s, meaning you can keep the sides upto date.The commentary is ok, always a hard thing to get right for games, it sometimes gets the calls just plain wrong. Calling some overs wicket maidens or going for to much etc.Game also has PINK BALL tests :D , one of the few times I am excited by pink.As of 24/1/17 -- Animations for proper stumpings sometimes arent there, just throws the ball at the stumps.- Batter goes the long way round to get back into the crease, which sometimes leads to you being run out by half of your toe.- Also doesnt ground the bat properly or get back into crease quickly after declining a run or dancing down the wicket.- Batter steps along way to off stump when trying to play leg side shots sometimes, which leads to you getting bowled when you just wanted to glance the ball.- Sometimes when you get given not out you end up being placed at the non-strikers end.- Fielders are a bit dopey sometimes, overthrows are still rare but sometimes the ball is thrown to you, your player does nothing, the player behind you does nothing, the ball goes to the boundary.- On occasion spin bowlers will be called for ""to high"" no ball.- Ai rarely changes field to anything other than the opening fieldSometimes hits the ball straight to the slips.- Wickets are better than 14, but havent had any reason to have close fielders other than regulation slips.All or some of these maybe player skill based but have been my experience so far.Will update later after a few more hours. :)"

Cricket games are rare nowadays with EA and CODEMASTERS backing out on their Cricket game releases! It was a bold move from Big Ant to release a cricket game and that too with immense effort being put in.I have played DBC14 and now coming to DBC17 this game is wonderful and smooth to play which offers a tremendous amount of fun and rich playing experience. But i still believe this is not a full baked cake as there are multiple issues which i have seen while playing and to point out i feel fielding is bit let down and it needs improvement so as for field placing setting. Graphics part looks decent but then again - eventhough there is a cricket academy and community apart - say for eg: Team India - Except for Virat kohli and MSD none of the players were created right in the community!commentatory is a let down which offers very less for a user experience. But then again coming back to gameplay , inspite of all the complains i have, this game is good and from a country which loves cricket a lot, i believe this should be in the collection of every cricket loving gamer!!

It sucks the fun out of the game.The commentary is the worst in a sporting game ever.Saying that it can't be compared to an EA or 2K title is also not realistic if you concider the price tag.So it is fair to compare it to such titles and it is garbage in comparison.Step up your game devs.The only reason anyone is buying this game is because there is no competition.I will never buy another game from these devs unless they improve the game now.If you are concidering buying this, please, please don't waste your money or try it for an hour and if itisn't for you refund it.I am saddened that this is the ""best"" cricket game available today. Where is the fun devs?Have you tried playing your own game?Poor excuse for a cricket game, this is DBC14 with HD textures and the models are ashideous as ever.I don't review often but I felt I needed to.

I am not a regular reviewer of games despite gaming a lot and having a lot of games, so please stick with me if I ramble a bit.I finsihed with 994 hours of playtime on DB14 and I am sure I will clock even more playtime on this.I was really nervous buying this game with the mixed reviews that are on here but I decided to buy the game anyway as I remeber how good the dev team were at fixing issues on DB14 and my passion for cricket.  I needn't have been worried about anything.The batting brings a new challenge without changing too many of the things that made the last game so good.  I am still getting used to it but I get  a bit better with every innings, despite getting frustrated with myself for playing stupid shots (a lot like real life!)The bowling is a lot more rewarding than on DB14 where I felt sometimes it was too easy on the lower difficulties and was a bit of a boring slog on the harder difficulties, on this version I feel like I really get into the battle between batsmen and bowler. I read that the controls are a lot more difficult, but I have found them to be absolutely fine.The whole Career mode has had a revamp and it is fantastic, you earn SP points which you can use to level up certain batting/bowling/fielding attributes as you go along. You start off playing for a side local to the county you choose to play for and play in t20 matches for them until you are good enough to be selected for your county, you can also choose the batting and bowling difficulties independantly which is a fantastic idea.CONSI have only found two real negatives at the moment which are;1. The game randomly crashes when loading up a match (averaging once for every 10 hours of game time so far)2. The wording in the game, you can use shorter or longer pitch bowling. This annoys me everytime I see it, obviously longer is the opposite of shorter but in the context of cricket it should be shorter or fuller pitch bowling!PROS1. Graphics - smoother, better and easier for the PC to handle than DB142. Batting -  more challenging and rewarding, you get yourself out playing the wrong shots3. Bowling - more rewarding and more fun4. Career Mode - Everything about it, brilliant ideas, brilliantly executed by the devs5. James Taylor on commentary - nice touch and hasn't got too repeatetive on me yetAll in all I fully recommend this game for anyone.

The bowling feels so much more compelling than in the previous game, edges are satisfying to watch, and the AI batting is much improved. When batting, the increased range of strokes makes it so much more fluent to play, and more of the shots feel useable, unlike in the previous game.The graphics are a letdown, whilst jarring at first, with character models appearing somewhat more cartoony than the previous game, the improvements to the animations, environments and lighting engine overall give it a nicer and realistic feel, though somewhat lacking compared to other triple A sporting titles on the market.The improved career mode is a godsend, injecting so much more life to playing as your own pro, with the introduction of dynamic teams and club cricket. It feels satisfying to work your way up from the bottom to the top, and the difficulty adjustments you can make on the way allow you to tailor the game to your liking.Some bugs do persist though, with AI fields in first class games to reacting quick enough to your shot placement, allowing you to continually score into vacant gaps and not reacting and plugging them. It’s easily possible to score very quick runs with low skilled batsmen into these gaps. This was a bug in the previous game, so it’s frustrating to see it carry over to this game, three years on.Overall, it’s a great cricket experience. The best cricket game ever made, and well worth a look."

A fun cricket game....Cons:-1. .... which is plagued by lack of production finesse2. Abysmal commentary3. Plenty of in-game glitches, which tend to get frustrating4. Lots of issues from DBC 14 carried overMy verdict: Buy it if you must have a fun cricket game to play right now, else wait for a decent discount and a couple of patches / updates.7/10DBC 17 comes nearly three years after DBC 14 broke new grounds in creating a fun yet challenging cricket game for all platforms, something which the biggies of the gaming industry *cough*EA*cough* had considered too demeaning for them to take up. DBC 14 was a genuinely fun game, but it had its issues, some of which were never resolved. Of course, the success of DBC 14 meant that the next iteration had to be big enough to live up to the high standards set by the studio.Sadly, I cannot give a convincing thumbs up to this iteration of the game. A lot has improved - batting is much more fluidic and realistic, especially at the tougher difficulty levels (if you are a DBC 14 veteran, don't be afraid to crank up the AI), bowling is tougher than before, but much more rewarding, once you get the hang of it, and fielding has been pushed up a couple of notches for the good. The interface remains simplistic, and focuses on getting you in the game as soon as possible. There are still no licensed players, but the fledgling community should take care of that. The career mode is much more comprehensive now, and slightly less frustrating than before (again, this depends on how it is evolved during the game's) life cycle.However, the improvements end here, at least for now. For a game priced at par with AAA titles, DBC 17 lacks production flair. A little more colour to the presentation would have done wonders, especially in the moments leading up to or after a match. Commentary is abysmal - there is no other word for it - with drab voices, unexcited commentators, and frequently messed up lines. Over time, you will realise how the bad commentary actually kills half the fun to be had out of the match. Animations could have been spruced up much more, and the fluidity could have been worked upon. It's not that the end game is bad, just that three years and a AAA price were enough for anyone to expect all the previous issues ironed out, and substantial improvements put in.While I can easily recommend this game to a DBC newbie / cricket enthusiast (assuming you are okay shelling out this kind of money), I will be hard pressed to do so to anyone who has played DBC 14. The game needs a couple of updates and major patches before it deserves that credit. I will be sure to update my review if and when that happens."

I'm a huge cricket fan and student of the game, and didn't think a video game would capture the subtleties of cricket, but, it does, it so does. 14 was playable but flawed, struggle to find the flaws with this one. The minor ones that come to mind include frustrating field changes by ai, the strike changes with some stumpings which is weird, the women seem to have super thin arms and and could use some more designing work. Biggest flaw is the field resets, especially in competition mode. Some, behind the scenes (news clippings, buzz on the circuit over a performance, maybe someday clips from cricketers) would be AWESOME in the career mode but it is incredibly cool as it is.Now for the good. In listing the jumps from 14, leg glance dominance is gone, edges are now a thing, run outs are more intuitive (keep rt and nothing else pressed, otherwise the runners do wierd things), the super-fielder problem is gone (great work done wrt problem) but best of all. SPIN IS THE WINNER, it is artistic and varied, though you need to figure out how to add a quicker one in there. The commentary is exponentially better but little things like speaking of overthrows like shots, anti climactic last ball commentary etc (ideally you should add specific commentary/lines for the end of matches).This ended up being longer than I planned but these are my thoughts of the top of my head. I'm not a gamer per se, just very into cricket and I'd recommend learning this for any lover of the game."

Capable of being extremely satisfying and highly frustrating in equal measures, I certainly wouldn't call it a polished game, even a couple of months from release and several patches.  As a bowler, tail end batsmen will occasionally happily despatch your 148kph inswinging yorkers back over your head for 4 or 6, or as a batsman you'll find your character leave their ground and get themselves run out when you told them not to.  The game will give you feedback saying you hit a perfectly timed and executed shot only for the ball to limply pootle through the air towards a fielder where the catch is easily taken, and for some reason the control inputs for trying to play (specifically) a front foot leg glance will make the player character teleport a foot or so to his right and get bowled without ever getting close to touching the ball.However, it seems to be of equal likeliness to these freak events that everything can go extremely well for you, once you've broken out of the silly ""club"" stage which sees you have to play T20 cricket (even if you wanted your player to be the second coming of Rahul Dravid and grind the opposition bowling down via attritional defensive play.)  Getting into a national competition like the County Championship (English) Sheffield Shield (Australian) or Ranji Trophy (India) among others is where the game really begins as you can really use the scale of those competitions to play your character in however you like, whether they be a specialist batsman or bowler, all-rounder or even a wicket-keeper.  Personally I've tried to make my player a bit like Kent legend Darren Stevens; a useful middle order batsman and wily medium pace bowler, and to its credit DBC 17 is happy for me to do that; as the game allows you when batting to fine tune shot selection you can block away as much as you like and then completely surprise the opposition by playing something like a slog sweep or ramp shot, and everything in between is possible... just unfortunately sometimes it just doesn't work properly.DBC 17 is likely as faithful a recreation of the game of cricket as can be achieved in a video game, although admittedly I haven't played its highly lauded predecessor, and although I only play village cricket myself I have watched a lot of cricket on television and in person, and I've never seen a slip fielder, from a standing start, slide three metres to their right to take a low catch off the outside edge. Nor have I seen the mid-off fielder throw down the stumps while clearly not looking in the right direction or even moving their torso, having gathered the ball mere nanoseconds before.  I mean, Ab de Villiers is good, but he's not THAT good."

The AI is shocking, with fielders not diving for edges, or turning their backs on balls hit straight to them that then run away for 4. But by far the most annoying thing is their seeming obsession with throwing the ball to the bowler whenever a shot has been played. Whether the batsmen have run, from all over the field, they throw the ball to you. This means if you haven't had a chance to run back to the bowlers end, then it usually goes for 4 overthrows. The overthrows may only happen in 1 out of every 10 matches, but why the fielders think it is a good idea to constantly throw the ball to an unguarded end rather than the wicketkeeper is beyond me. Please, please, please sort the fielding out.Other than that it is a good game. The graphics are an improvement on DB14, as is the career mode with the options for creating a player and career progression both improving massively, though you start at 19 rather than being able to start at 16 as in DB14 which I would have preferred.As mentioned at the start you will need a controller for this game, and I think if I had a do-over I would have got this on console rather than PC. The Steam controller isn't quite there for batting, with the touch pad used for shot selection meaning, ironically, that is isn't as smooth as if it were a joystick. I am considering getting an Xbox controller for this, so if I do I will update this if it is an improvement. With bowling the touch pad is used for timing the jump and aiming the ball, so there are a few times when it doesn't register the pull back to start the jump and the bowler runs through, but other than that it isn't as bad as the batting.This game has really mixed reviews, with people either loving or hating it. Personally, apart from the fielding, this is a solid upgrade from DB14 and they have produced another decent game. Download the demo if you are unconvinced and judge for yourself, but I like the game and I have already started to think of excuses to get me out of social events and back home to play it..."

Ofcourse, a cricket lover would buy a cricket game (like us) to support Big Ant Studios for their work and so they could keep working.Cricket knowing for it's mechanism and fair standards.. this game quiet proves to be 5/10 to me.Cons:1. The Concept of Hit-Wicket is totally missing. (The batsman always hit it's wicket when running back to the crease.) This creates a very huge question in a game of cricket where every wicket is important.2. Glitch is observed whenever I try to open bowling tactics options 3 out of 10 times the game closes.(Why this was not covered on update) Note: I have a PC with GTX1070 so there's no issue with performance.3. Field Setting graphics or you could say User Interface is very poor. Don Bradman 14 field setting UI was far better. This game needs to work on with it's most important aspect which ""Fielding"". There should be a ""BETTER UI to FIELDING.""4. Competition modes should allow us to select only 1 team which we want to play with and rest auto simulate. Like in EA Sports 07 or Ashes or FIFA.. You know what i mean.5. To be honest Big Ant Studios should have given more importance to the Graphics instead of adding Women into this game.6. LORD'S STADIUM? HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME HAS A FAKE LORD'S STADIUM WHAT A SHAME FOR CRICKETERS. Seriously Big Ant Studios.. if you can use an orignal name then atleast provide an orginal default LORD'S Cricket Stadium.Other than thatWhat i expected was a ""STORY MODE"" where we could play some old scenarios of cricket or maybe relive the Don Bradman Character itself by playing his Story Mode. etc.Time for the Positive Reviews:1) Game Mechanics so far is very good related to other sports game i've saw except the graphics part which sucks literally bad in 2017 era..2) I am also really quiet impressed by the bowling controls which this game has provided. It's really fantastic. Couldn't ask much better than this.3) Enough varities we can choose on ""Physics Modifiers"", i really liked it. Instead of just fixing the AI's difficulty, now we can also modify the physics and have more variety in our game than ever before.4) About Career mode, that i haven't played yet. But i heard it's really good and i've saw videos on it too before i bought this game.Overall Review:This game gets 5/10 rating from me.-1.5 for Graphics.-1 for Bugs/Glitches.-1.5 for OverPricing.-1 for lack of Story Mode and all mentioned Cons above.Thanks, Big Ant Studios for this fantastic work for the game of Cricket.

Sure the graphics and interface are better, but the game physics are aweful!Batting is impossible, and even in easy mode, you cant smash the ball around.Only play this game if youre willing to study it for 10,000 hours and treat it like a phd in a computer game before you can actually play the game -- and have fun.There is no skills transfer from DBC14 to DBC17 -- so all that experience is worthless, and certainly batting in DBC17 is further away from real cricket than DBC14 was.Batting needs to be patched and fixed, otherwise dont waste any time playing this game!!!"

I have put in more than 100 hours in DBC '14 which was pretty good for it's time. But this game is more like a downgrade from the previous one.Cons:1) Graphics is mediocre.2) AI is poor.3) Shot making is very tough compared to DBC '14.4) Commentary in this game has got to be one of the worst for the game of this genre.5) Too many bugs to list them all.Pros:1) More customization compared to DBC '14 like downloadable stadiums, kits etc.2) Controls are improved.3) Bowling mechanisms are totally redesigned and it's much improved now.Well, if you are a die hard cricket fan and you already own DBC '14, don't bother buying this."

,Not Recommended,464850,29325983,Posted: 17 January,all,maibhassin,"I don't understand all the positive reviews, DBC 14 is way better than this. Animation looks so fake, when fielders throw the ball most of the times the are not even facing the right direction. Once I was standing inside the crease and WK appealed for stump out and umpire send the decision to 4th umpire and in replay I was clearly standing inside the crease but 4th umpire still gave out. And at higher batting difficulties it's impossible to bat against spinners only option is to hit advance shots. Every team has same fielding setup. If you want good gameplay just go for DBC 14. Only good thing is depth of content in career mode but still it can be improved in lots of ways."

Just buy DBC 14 if you want to play a cricket game, you will get it cheaper and it has less problems.The bugs from 14 are still present and they've even thrown a few more in to make you hate the experience that much more.PROSCareer mode is much betterPlayer, Team, Stadium customisation is goodBit nicer to look atCONSPretty much everything else. Fielding is just a disaster,♥♥♥♥♥♥animations, constant overthrows, running balls over boundary, glitching in and out of crease. TheCommentary makes me want to kill myself. The graphics bug out and lock on depth of field randomly. Moving in the crease sometimes makes you unable to play a shot. Moving the field works some of the time, sometimes you have to watch them walk like slugs to their new positions. Multiplayer running between wickets works smoothly about 25% of the time.I don't understand how they can develop a game and instead of focusing on the underlying issues of the previous version they choose to ignore them and add a bunch of stuff that sounds good, but is ultimately poorly developed and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"

,Not Recommended,464850,29332737,Posted: 18 January,all,Potifar,"I bought the game yesterday and was rather disappointed. Just to clarify, I played DBC 14 for just over 400 hours. My first gripe was apparent as soon as I started batting. The white of the sight screen, the Umpire's hat and coat, as well as the bowler was absolutely glaring and rather distracting. Even changing the Gamma settings did not help. Secondly, the new commentary is horrendous and kind of lame.... Replays are not smooth and rather jumpy, not worth watching.The only reason I will continue playing this game in perpetuity is the excellent simulation of the game of Cricket. The game is very challenging and this after I only played the previous iteration on Legend mode. Now, I am finding Pro mode tough going."
76561198013872287,Not Recommended,464850,29373215,Posted: 20 January,all,zealcity,"At the current level the game is certianly not worth it. the balance of the game ceases to be enjoyable and overall i feel the developers in the conquest to make it better have actually ruined the gameplay in the process. The controls are  very difficult, the animations are not par to the price that they are asking and overall the gameplay sucks at the moment.I have played every cricket game that has ever come out (atleast i think i have) and i can honestly say that this edition is really not upto the mark.What i feel they have done is to just add a few new  teams, the commentary is still rigid and certianly not worth the price the game is being sold for. If you are looking for a great cricket simulation then this is really not worth it.the batting controls are way off, to frustrating since every time i play and miss i am caught behind the wickets, and i am talking after spending atleast 30 hours in the previous edtion. The developers have developed the game without any prior research in cricket, all they have done is to add Don bradmans name and hoping to sell as many copies before the fans get a wind of it.this game should have been sold for less than 10 bucks and it might be bang on the money, the experience is way off and i seriously dont understand their complicated level up system and i am talking after buying and playing atleast 150 games on steam.first off some of the things that could have been done to improve -1.Batting - 1/10  even at the easiest level it takes a lot of time before you even are off the mark, if you thought 14 was hard, then 17 is not for the faint hearted,2. Graphics - 3/10 -  nothing actually, its still the same old 1st generation graphics, a few new faces have been added but the rest are the same,cameras -1/10  Pathetic, come on guys do some research, you have one angle for practice and one for gameplay , whoever thought of this brilliant suggestion  should be fired straightaway, although they do have a pro mode where you see in an fps mode but nothing out of the ordinary3. Animations - 5/10 , a little rigid when it comes to running but overall the animations arent anything spectacular, if these devs priced it close to an indie title i would have said amazing, but when you price it at a AAA price point then you deserve to be criticised if not to the mark.4. Bowling -1/10  where do i even start, its like learning a new programming language there are atleast 5-6 different controls to bowl a ball, come on , i get it you want a deeper simulation but in the process its like you have to spend atleast 5-6 hours to even enjoy playing the game5. feilding - its pretty much automated although they have added a few new controls to increase the speed of the throw etc.overall i dont think its worth it, but then if you truly are a cricket fan then you can buy it more for novelty sake rather than enjoyment. The devs need to keep pace in terms of development along with their marketing which they truly are good at. Sometimes i find the mobile simulation games much better than the ones that are available on steam, i think the devs should look closer to something like Cricket Career in Android which is much better when it comes to game play and features, just a thought."

,Not Recommended,464850,29647221,Posted: 2 February,all,champdood,"17 hours into this so far and am giving up until bug fixes come along. With a game like cricket, bowling to a strategy only to see your perfect LBW not called because according to the game it hit outside off stump (it didn't) is far more of a deal breaker than you'd think.Pros:The fielding isn't insane in this game. No fielders running at 200mph to take a catch compared to DB14Bowling is actually compelling and fun. You get mostly punished for crap bowling and rewarded for mixing it upVisualisations (reviews, batting movements) improvedGood overall game.Cons:Commentary is utterly attrocious. Very little variation and it's often flat out wrong.LBW ""hit outside off stump"" when it obviously did hit in the line. Plum LBWs regularly missed.Inconsistent gameplay. Last 4 games I edged a shot where I had perfect footwork, shot selection and timing. Basically the same shot 4 times over. Then I'll hit a shot with bad footwork and timing for 4.Fielders never throw to the end that makes logical sense (throw to the keeper unless there's a runout chance, they seem to do the opposite)Spinner fielding off their own bowling. Will stand there like a hapless idiot as the ball rolls past their feetLoad times are really bad for a simple game, especially career mode where you'll play a lot of games back to backRunning between wickets, don't put bat down until after reaching the end, hard to trigger second runs early on so you don't know what will happen. Kind of imaginary timing going on that's a game in itself.Recommend buying it in a few months.Additional thoughts: So a few weeks on, no bug patches and it becomes obvious that the bugs are pretty buried throughout the game. A lot of this makes no sense. So many bad LBW calls (even on review). The D/L method is broken in T20 matches. Batting turns into a frustrating mess when your batsman times it perfectly, with the perfect shot, only to get yet another edge. Some incredible graphic glitches - pitch was so bright I couldn't play at one point (looked like someone cranked the sun to about 3000%) mixed with some bizarre fielding (the tap back from the rope is great, that the player won't turn around and throw themselves is not so great). Some simple gameplay tweaks and adjustments would go a long way to make this game more enjoyable and less frustrating"
