76561197999647773,Recommended,464960,24288279,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,ErsatzDragon,A small and very well done game inspired by / in tribute to Nifflas' Knytt series and other exploration platformers.  Well worth the tiny price.
76561198050199422,Recommended,464960,24349891,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,orbitalmindcontrol,"A highly enjoyable, relaxing exploration game: you're free to go where you want on the map, in any order, right from the start. There are no power-ups to collect and only one area that requires you to unlock a door to it first. The music blends seamlessly from one area to the next, matching the theme of that area well, and there are lots of secrets to be found (hint: look closely for differences in walls and floors) Absolutely recommended!"

,Recommended,464960,24374474,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,Letax CZ,"A very relaxing platformer about collecting bits of energy (I guess) to save your village. It is nothing complex, but it is deceptively easy. On one hand, there are obvious bits that you can pick up right away, then there are hidden rooms that require you to pay attention to the environment, and then there are well hidden collectibles that only the keen find.The game's world consists of I think eight diverse biomes you can freely traverse and explore. It is big enough to have lots of nooks and crannies for you to find, but small enough that going to the other end of the map is not obnoxious. Puzzles are not difficult, yet there is still a sense of achievement in solving them. It is also important that every biome has it's own music so it does not get obnoxious.TL;DR: If FEZ and Knytt had a baby, this could be it."

,Recommended,464960,24418297,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,snail.orgy,"If you enjoy exploration platformers like Knytt, An Untitled Story, and Seiklus, you will most likely enjoy this charming little game. It didn't take me very long to 100% and that's probably a good thing as it didn't feel like the experience dragged on at all. I was able to find most of the collectibles myself and only needed to read a hint for a couple specific things. The game also does a nice job of giving visual hints for where to get the remaining collectibles. The environments are mysterious but relaxing and the whole experience was nice and comfy. One secret ending might be very challenging depending on the player (it's the only instance of combat in the game) but the rest of the game is pretty forgiving reactions-wise. All in all, it would be hard not to recommend this game, especially at this low price point."

A well constructed homage to Nifflas, and a title well worth playing to fans of his work :)"

It's not hard to finish the whole game in an evening, though I needed 2 hints about where to look for some collectibles. Good music and sound design. The art is decent, sometimes really nice, and sometimes a little lazy. Controls are a bit stiff, especially around ladders, but the platforming was not so tricky that this got in the way. Feels very Game-maker, but also very genuine. I liked it a lot."

,Recommended,464960,31816343,Posted: 17 May,all,WildCrd007,This is the type of game where you take your time and enjoy discovering new areas and collecting different objects with a few puzzles. The look and feel of the game is really simple but very enjoyable. I had a lot of fun playing it and comparing gameplay to the price (I got the Collector's Edition) I got more than my monies worth out of it. There is also a PDF in the game's directory that I liked reading about how the game came to be.

The puzzles were really good, not too hard and definitly not too easy. It was amazing to explore the world, wich has so many interesting biomes! I recommend this to anyone, the little money that it costs is worth it!"

The closest thing to death in this game is when you close and uninstall it. There is nothing interesting in any aspects of this game, I don't feel challenged I feel cheated for spending money."

Its smooth, goes at youre own pace, youre free to explore everything in wat ever order you want to. In fact, this is very similar to fez, you even have to colect the lil yellow cubes! but with lower grapihcs (also, no waiting for loading ) either way, it's worth the money"
