It has a lot of bugs and is boring in its current state. The textures are very low-res compared to all of the imagery that is available from NASA. The rocks look like they are made from styrofoam. The teleporting is slow and not always accurate. The landers and hologram of mount olympus were decent. Driving the rover with the dust storm was the best part of the experience, until the dust storm dissapeared."

(Re-)Learned some interesting facts about the planet(s) & the history of technology we've landed on Mars.We liked 30min, but that was a 5min+ where my spouse had problems w/interacting not working. Restarted & fixed it.I didn't finish it in the remaining 25min+ that I spent going through the adventure, reading things, listening to narration, and the interactive portions (again, they mix things up a bit so it's not repetitive/boring). Will return to finish (had to stop for un-game-related reasons).Cool little experience to put people new to VR into. Not some hours long thing & not physically taxing (so good for variety of ages/condition). And for the cheap price, you might just learn something (more) about Mars/NASA landers&rovers.Keep up good work devs!"

,Recommended,465150,25439263,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,WuJJ,"Small, short game that matches its discounted price well. It's half an hour worth spending. It's more like an impressive educational app than a game, but will sure spark some interest in our journey to Mars. While the almost non-exist ""gameplay"" part is underwhelming,it did prompt me to search how Opportunity cleans its dust on solar panel after blasting the dust off in game.Yeah, it's a shame that I don't know the secret of long lives of Mars rovers until now. However, to my defense, I wasn't closely following them 12 years ago after the initial excitement of Spirit and Opportunity's successful landing. Downloading a tiff from NASA took me almost an hour on a modem link in China back then. Now with half an hour, I am appreciating a real-sized Opportunity and Curiosity on Mars. What a time to be alive!Valve's Destination showed me Curiosity in VR first. Mars Odyssey let me touch a few instruments and see what they are. Now, just wait for a while, I am sure I will be able to actually use those instruments to do some great science on Mars!===================短小用心的游戏，尤其是现在的促销价推荐购入，绝对是很值得花的半小时。游戏要素很少，更像是一个精美的教育展示，但仅有的游戏过程还是让我去搜索了机遇号是怎么除去太阳能电池板上的灰尘的。讲道理现在才知道真是丢人啊，但当年机遇和勇气着陆以后就兴奋了一小会儿就没关心了，尼玛我记得modem下张全尺寸TIFF都要一小时啊。然而现在的半小时，我却能在VR中近距离观摩真是大小的机遇和好奇号，真是今非昔比啊。Valve的Destination让我第一次看到了好奇号，现在这游戏又让我接触和了解了上面的仪器，那么下一个火星游戏，就应该可以操作这些仪器搞科学啦！！"

What a misleading game title!It's just some ""tech demos""/levels you're skipping through and the game mechanics are minimalistic.I didn't feel like being on mars at all."
,Recommended,465150,25448697,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,MasterBlaster,Well executed.  Consider this as 'The Blu in space'. :)Really enjoyable demo of how VR should work.Not much replay value - but immersive and a lot of fun.Recommended.

,Not Recommended,465150,25577537,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,Seed_cracker,"I bought this game because of my intrests in astronomy. It met some of my expectations but there are few things that could be improved. I like the game mechanics but it feels like a game made for children. There is no proper excitment. The most fun part about it was (spoilers) driving the tiny rover. It ended too quickly for me but I like the fact that you can travel to previous visited places. I don't think it's fully ready yet so I will not recommend this. I'm sorry to say this, but it does have some potential. I'm gonna keep it for the time being and let's see where this goes."

The sunrise is beautiful as well.Visuals are great and audio is fantastic. I was expecting Athena to go Glados on me at one point though. ;)

It is short but nice, with interesting details on the various machines Nasa sent to Mars and some good (although not spectacular) visuals. At this price, I would say it is a must-buy for anybody interested in space exploration"
,Recommended,465150,25452291,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,tim,"A lot of people are disappointed by some VR games for their short playtime, so kudos to Steel Wool for putting a 20 minute estimate in the games description so poeple know what to expect. For me, however, this was a significant underestimate - I spent the first 5 minutes just gazing out the window of the space staton and watching Mars go by beneath me. Quite enjoyed the premise and narration, too.Recommended wholeheartedly for anyone remotely interested in space."

,Recommended,465150,25435751,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,CorreAktor,Very well done. It will be one of my go-to experiences when demoing for friends.
,Recommended,465150,25465686,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Harvester of Sorrow,"A fun, short educational on the planet next door.  Graphics are stunning and lifelike which make the experience much more immersive and something you will want to share with friends.  (Side note: My favorite thing about the game, which may be lame for some, was that you're actually wearing a helmet while on the planet's surface! Made it that much more realistic!)Now this game isn't for everyone.  While it is an educational experience it is not on the same level as Apollo 11 VR or theBlu which I would say are far more engaging.  In Mars Odyssey you're engagment is limited to repairing a few robots, remote operating a small rover, and watching the sunrise.  If you love all things outside our Earth's atmosphere then pick this up and go on a journey 54.6 million kilometers away!*Side note* Guys, think of VR being in science classrooms all around the world.  How incredible would that be for kids, after learning about their solar system, to actually visit their moon or another planet!  Whether it be miles away from earth or miles under the ocean, I think VR has the capablities to really engage young minds.  I don't know about you, but I hands on/ interactive learning was always the best for me."
,Recommended,465150,25433242,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,Solrac Invictus,"This is a really short experience but really well done and informative.  The quality is top notch but a one key suggestion to devs would be to allow for the landing experience when you leave the space station, to see an atmospheric approach and landing on Mars would be awesome and really enhance the entire experience."
76561198294884439,Recommended,465150,31880811,Posted: 21 May,all,kumogari,"Mars Odyssey is short and straightforward but it is stronger because of it. You check out a space station then repair some robots on Mars. Along the way I learned a little about Mars and the real robots who have been exploring it on our behalf. Most importantly, I got lost in the experience and by the end I was excited about the future of our species on Mars and among the stars. This is not a game but as an educational experience, I loved it."
