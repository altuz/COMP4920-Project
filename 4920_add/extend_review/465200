,Recommended,465200,32375540,Posted: 12 June,all,GryphonKingBros,"Badass people get this product for free. I accidentally checked the box that says ""Check this box if you received this product for free"".Honestly its a pretty great game. I mainly enjoy it because it feels like one of those ""screw-it-up-and-you-start-all-over"" kind of games where you run around really fast. (I think I'm describing oldtimey sonic the hedgehog...) It throws you into each level without anything to work with besides a gun, a badass face, and several different enemies to fight off against. Your environment acts much like a comic book as every item you get is referenced to a comic book title along with progression as killing enemies gives you Ink which is your currency. You upgrade three catagories to make your Hero stronger, grab REALLY COOL WEAPONS along the way and REALLY COOL ITEMS along the way too, and at the end of the three pages, there a big fat boss to defeat that plus isn't the same every time!It's very frusterating when you screw it up and have to go through hell again to kick♥♥♥♥♥and deal with it again, but besides that its really fun! Would recommend!"

Im really surprised how much fun im having with it so far and cant wait to see what else the devs have up their sleeves."
,Recommended,465200,31595131,Posted: 6 May,all,Ferret Poop,"9/10 roguelike, maybe 10/10 when ""complete"".PROS* Very tight controls* Pure skill-based challenge* Nice rogue-lite progression makes the game more surmountable, but the skill unlocks actually require mastery to utilize well* GREAT animations, fun and lively, very stylized and done well* Cool weapons & itemsCONS* Because it's a platformer, vertical ascension is needed but can be a little frustratingly difficult to pull off at times. Maybe I suck."

Mostly because its easy to get hung up on a platform you didnt mean toadd invincibility frames when you stomp and when you dash. it shouldnt be a peice of equipmentmake rooms feel a little less chlosteraphobic. in fact just get rid of a lot of the traps. all they do is restrict movement in a game where movement is importantbuff the damage of sniper riflesmake guns a little easier to getI think the game could have an easy mode. Ive always wanted one of these games that was easier to get into and I think an easy mode that makes you take less damage or just decreases the amount of stuff on screen would be niceguns need a lot more impact. add some screen shake, or a louder gun shot soundplease add musicadd more gun types like pistols, revolvers, assault rifles, and maybe some melee weaponsget rid of the effect of the crosshair disapearing when it moves into a foreground object. its annoyingthe camera moves around too much. Expand the point at which the mouse must move to move the cameragive us a better reason to want to fight the mini-bosses. the legendary items arent good enough. I try to not find the mini-bosses and I think the reward should be good enough that I want to look for the mini-boss. maybe have the mini-boss drop full health, increase the power of the legendary weapons or have a bunch of loot dropsBut what I like is the skill ceiling is very high, its a roguelike where you feel a little meaty and not fragile at all.there are no secrets, its upfront and decently explained"

,Recommended,465200,30155418,Posted: 24 February,all,Droucil,"TL;DR: Has a lot of potential, but work to do. Only get this if you want to help forming the game!*Video contains gameplay, below is the reviewhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDwlh_32kESince it just released in its early access state, there is still a lot of content missing. This isn't that big of a deal, if you don't mind following the state of the game and help shaping it up. Also meaning that the current version keeps you amused for a couple of hours at most, till the next content patch comes up.I personally play with a controller and I do think this game is made for it. Although, if wanted, it can be played with a keyboard and mouse. As for the controller, it feels smooth, has a valid standard layout (which can be changed if wanted) and suits well with the learning curve of the game itself.Unlike a few other rogue-likes I played, the missiles projected by enemies can't be dodged in any way (like dashing, down stomp) and must be avoided at all costs. This took me some time getting used to, and in some occasions due to RNG being a ♥♥♥♥♥, gave me unfair situations. Rooms filled with enemies, with projectiles coming from everywhere, nearly impossible to avoid. Be that as it may, it seems to be a core element of the game and in general works well apart from those few instances where you get blown to pieces (or atleast lose half of your HP when you where just doing so well!).Regarding RNG, there is a lot of it in this game, even the bosses are randomized by changing the layout of the environment. Which feels refreshing but as mentioned above, in some occasions can be a bit unfair.There currently are just a few different weapons (amongst others: smg, shotgun, bazooka, minigun) which are randomized by things like different reload speed, more magazine ammo, freeze/burn effect etc. You do have unlimited ammo, and only shoot with guns (atleast so far, no melee of any kind). While playing you find these weapons along with other items that you can either use for that playthrough or redeem for experience instead.The enemies feel very different from each other and the animations are well executed. Giving you that learning curve improving with each run you make. Meanwhile leveling up unlocking new abilities like more health, more drops, longer combo time, faster reload speed, etc. (mostly passive). Keeping your combo count up is also pretty important, advancing quickly from one stage to the other getting bonuses from the abilities you unlocked by leveling up in your previous runs.The music in its current stage is very boring, linear, its basicly one soundtrack that gets more intense when your combo count goes up. However, they mentioned in their early access FAQ this will be completly reworked and is just a placeholder for now.So all in all, this game has a lot of potential. It might be a bit steep for its current state, but may definitly be worth it in the end. I would only recommend getting this game if you want to try it out for now and help building the game to a solid final release."

,Recommended,465200,30148333,Posted: 24 February,all,VoidT3rror Deja Vu,Game is very good. If this is early acces i'm scared what they are preparing. Game is very dynamic and have fantastic animations. I recommend this game :)
,Recommended,465200,30604782,Posted: 18 March,all,[LUE] Leperkawn,"This game is quite fun. At first its incredibly brutal and unforgiving. Once you learn the ropes, it becomes quite fun (but still unforgiving).At first, my goal was not to rack up a high combo, but just to kill things without dying while learning how the game works. After you put a few points into the things that increase combo time, health drops, and ink (xp) pickup, as well as just learn how to play the game, you start to realize the true potential of the game. There is this awesome balance between not getting hit (breaks your combo) and running EVERYWHERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO FIND NEW ENEMIES TO KILL!A++ would play again"
76561198034908082,Recommended,465200,32629579,Posted: 21 June,all,Bane,"This game is a hidden gem. The art is solid, has a hand drawn feel to it as well as it's own comic style and presentation.Another big plus imho is how the devs have been actively updating and adding chapters, rounding out this game. so far, overall quite satisified with the purchase. One neat thing I like is when/if you go to a room and get fired upon and promptly exit, the shot waits for you to return - no freebie cheap escape lol.A bit on difficult, but well made."

76561198071697160,Recommended,465200,32370418,Posted: 12 June,all,Deckard,"Super fun roguelite, with several upgrade options, tough enemies, and challenging bosses. The artwork and animation is very well done for such a small game. With this being in EA I'm really hoping the developer expands on skill trees and weapons."
,Recommended,465200,32282874,Posted: 8 June,all,Antagonist,"Badass Hero is a challenging sidescroller shooter roguelite. The combat is a lot of fun. The controls are tight. The enemies vary in difficulty and appearance. But there are 2 things it DESPERATELY needs: background music, currently there is none whatsoever and for a shoot em up action roguelite to not have background music is dumb and I can only assume this is an early access restriction so I wouldn't take a point away from it. It also needs to allow you to edit controls. It says to hold shift as you launch, but that does not work, and besides that, there's no way to edit controller controls at all, even though it works fully.Overall the game is good, it's fun, and if they add background music and the ability to change the controls (Left trigger to jump is the stupidest control ever. A is to jump. A.) then I will say this could have infinite replayability. The tiers in content are revealed in ""Comics"" which is a nice change from ""Floor 1-1, Floor 2-1, Floor 3-1, etc"", plus they are all different themes. One is in space. The first one is in an Amazonian Mayan looking village.I would probably give the game in its current state a 7 out of 10, and definitely recommend it for the small price tag. If it adds music and control editing I'd give it more of an 8.5. The lack of music is deafening in a game like this.Edit: There is temporary background music that is barely audible, but the dev says they're adding some soon. And the next update should have control mapping. So with that said, I'd give this game an 8.5"

On that difficulty it plays more like a shootem up bullet ""heck"" (bullet hell for beginners).I'm really looking forward to seeing how this one develops.Thanks guy!"
,Recommended,465200,33409344,Posted: 9 July,all,buttpiss,"grind your way to cheap killsi guess i'm a fan of rogue-ish games, so i keep playing badbutt hero to try to be able to last long enough to kill a boss or two, but it is terribly frustrating at times.there's hidden enemies that pop up out from underneath you with little warning and you can easily just fall down into a pit of enemies that attack you instantly; most games i play i can blame myself for getting killed, but there have been several times in this game where i yelled aloud, ""oh come on!!!""otherwise, controls are tight, graphics are a fun comic book style with a tiny bit of character customization where you can change the skin, hair, and accessories. leveling up is slow, especially as the game progresses.i've yet to see any other environment other than the jungle, but this just might be the fact that i haven't progressed long enough....there must be other enivronments, right?! cuz i'm not seeing any others in the screenshots.there's still some bugs too. there's times where i can't get to the next ""screen"" at the bottom and have to re-jump up and down again to continue. 3440x1440 displays, but the vingette is set at 16:10, so you see dead ends where rooms are supposed to connect...strange. w/e, it's still fun, so:get it on sale for a quick fix here and there."

The jumping feels very floaty and often very frustrating, the music is horrible as it only has one really bad track, the artstyle is... accuired taste to put it that way.The gunplay is decent enough, there is nice progression and good impact on the guns but there are so many other games that does the same but better."

,Recommended,465200,31087158,Posted: 11 April,all,SenatorIvy,"You know how a lot of games like to say they're like FTL? This is the equivalent of that, except replace FTL with Rogue Legacy.I've only played a little bit, and it's a lot of fun. Still a bit clunky, but not in any way that feels like it can't be tightened a bit.  Nothing feels wrong but a few things feel in need of slight adjustment.  Cool concept, good art. Dunno why the non-gun arm is quite that long but hey.If you liked Rogue Legacy and you want to shoot things, you'll probably like this.  It's not Rogue Legacy level, but it's got real potential to be that kind of fun and I'm looking forward to playing it more."
