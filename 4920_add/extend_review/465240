Yes, this is a wave shooter but it is actually a blast to play and it is polished unlike most others. Do yourself a favor and buy it (especially being on sale right now). By far the most fun I've had with the VIve to date. In it's current state there are two worlds (With 3 levels of difficulty.) out of five that are available to play. I may be stating the obvious but don't expect an award winning story but everything from the production value to the graphics/sound/controls are right on point and those boss battles... insane fun! I can't wait to see what else the developers have in store for us.My number 1 want for this title, co-op... Please bring it!(Will update review as updates to the title are released.)(Be sure to check out our group Vive VR -http://steamcommunity.com/groups/HTCVIVEVR)"
,Recommended,465240,35089123,Posted: 20 September,all,Craig1287,"Yeah, it's a standing wave shooter, but it's one of the best out there. The gameplay of the SS games is not too far off from what you have in a standing shooter anyways. The skill was always in the shooting and prioritizing enemies, and that's still here and in a much bigger way. Because you're stationary, the game is able to spawn the enemies into the levels in very cool pasterns and orders. Also, the upgrades/abilities do add a lot to the chaos of the game. Some of these levels would be impossible without the help of those abilities.9.5/10"

,Recommended,465240,27494754,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Psycold,"I've been playing Serious Sam games since 2001, getting to kill all these characters that I grew up with (33 years old now) in V.R. is an awesome experience. Initially I was a bit worried about the lack of content and the fact that it's a front facing only game (no 360 degree movement like Raw Data or Brookhaven Experiment), but honestly I think that is a big part of what keeps bringing me back to the game. With V.R. there are sometimes a lot of variables just to get into a game depending on your setup, so I've found the easier the game is to play, the more inclined I am to load it up and play a few rounds.All you do really is stand in one area while enemies come at you, not much different from what you see in the trailers...except in V.R. it's obviously a much better experience. Visually this is one of the best Vive games out there, I would put it in the top 5 easily. They have gone great work to make things crisp so you can aim at enemies in the distance and be even more horrified when they make it right up in your face.Right now there are only 2 planets to play, each with 3 or 4 levels. After you beat a level you go back to your spaceship where you use the money you earned to buy more guns, ammo and health. If you die, you lose the weapons you bought but you still bring some of the money you earned from the last map. They are still planning on adding at least 2 more planets.If you're an Onward player and have created a rifle mount, I recommend you try it out with Serious Sam V.R. I've been turning people onto this idea for the past couple of weeks, but basically it helps aiming a lot and makes you better at conserving ammo. Here is a video of my roommate where I was showing him the primary assault rifle, secondary double barrel shotgun.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ww9-tIH2AkYou can aim down the rifle sights perfectly and take out enemies from across the map, then use the shotgun for close range. It's also pretty fun having a minigun/rocket launcher but you can figure out your own combos."

However, in typical Croteam fasion, they have managed to pull off an engine which looks great (probably the best looking VR game I've seen so far) and runs so smoothly (even with HUGE amounts of enemies running at you at once)I've also gotten pretty fed up of early access games, with their slow and small updates (if at all) however with a fantastic team like Croteam you just know that will not be the case and I really look forward to the finished product.No bugs for me so farKeep up the good work guys!"

I'm able now to effortlessly sit in my high-back office, with arm rests, and pivoting to mow down those endless hordes!Playing on 'Easy' wasn't as easy as it sounds! It took hours of replays, more than I would like to admit, to get through all the levels. Almost cleared Earth on 'Normal' many times, but that's going to take another couple of hours of play. The next planet is going even harder and many hours later. On 'Hard', it doesn't even seem possible, MADNESS  I TELL YOU!Still in Early Access and by the time they release the next two planets, added more levels, leaderboards, etc., I MIGHT have finished 'Hard' on the first two. Then it's time to do it all over for the other two!This is my first time playing this franchise, so I'm not some loyalist that's been playing for through the series, but I'm starting to become a fan and thinking of trying the other 2D games.So is it worth? Most definately! I will never regret this purchase, seriously!Tips:-Start with your lower grade weapons ( like the laser pistol, uses no ammo ) and move up to the higher calibers as the level becomes more overwhelming.-If you drain a weapon of ammo, you won't be able to use it again, so leave some rounds and catch the ammo crate later to resupply , especially if it's of great power you'll need later.-The chainsaw is great if you keep being overwhelmed with enemies rushing in on you. Leaves the other hand free for long distance attacks too.-Take a rest and use a chair, any kind will do I guess, but I use my comfy office chair with arm rests. Great if your too tiredfor the more physical games and just want to blow things to bits to release some steam after a long hard day!"

You can't move out of your room-scale area, but you can dodge some projectiles by moving in your room. There is a nice variety of weapons and shooting feels great. Currently there are two planets implemented (final game will have 5), each one has 4 levels with an unique end boss in the last. Each level offers variety in terms of enemy types and enviroment. The graphics are quite nice for a VR title Basically it's what you expect from Serious Sam, hordes of enemies, big weapons and shooting like there is no tomorrow. It's really polished and I would say it's one of the best wave shooters avaiable. Keep in mind that it's still in early access and lots of features have yet to be implemented (final three planets, skill tree, achievements, co-op)."

,Not Recommended,465240,26157529,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Eventually, either when the game is finished or even maybe just later down the Early Access line, I'll probably repurchase this game. I love Serious Sam and I want to love this game, but right now it just doesn't feel like a $30 or $40 game. Obviously I don't have very much playtime so this is all just a first impression, but when it comes to a wave shooter like this sometimes that's all you need.There are two big problems I have with the game. While the game does deserve credit for its developers not caving into Oculus's paid timed exclusive buyouts, the game does at least seem designed with Oculus Touch in mind, as unlike most Vive wave shooters this game is almost entirely front-facing, with very little coming at you from the sides and nothing from behind. I went into the game knowing this and wanted to try it with an open mind, but it's just not as fun as other Vive shooters; it doesn't encourage you to move at all, and feels more like playing a light gun shooter in an arcade than actually playing a VR game. It just never gave me the feeling that this was something that had to be done in VR.The other problem is that the guns just don't feel very good to shoot. Serious Sam has plenty of fun weapons throughout the series, and most of them show up in this, but they're all basically interchangable so they feel more like toys than guns. Whether it's a tiny pistol or a chainsaw that's three times the size of any chainsaw I've ever seen or a minigun that's nearly the size of your body, they all just get strapped to one of your hands and handle identically, with the only difference being actual weapon functions like the minigun's spin-up time. I feel like it would be a lot more interesting if they added in two-handed functions like Raw Data, like allowing you to hold the minigun by both handles (like Sam in the cover arts) in exchange for more ammo or something.Even in its current state Serious Sam VR isn't necessarily bad, but I wasn't as impressed as I expected to be from a $30+ game. Maybe it would've gotten better if I'd played more into it, maybe it wouldn't have, but what little I played bored me enough that I just didn't really care to see more of it in its current state."

I've been playing Serious Sam since the First Encounter on Xbox Original and when I heard that it was going to come out for VR, I was instantly excited for it.When it comes to wave shooters, while there are a lot of them for the Vive already, Serious Sam VR is a clear standout in my opinion. The game feels very polished even in its early access stage, and when it comes to gameplay, this game has all of the insanity that Serious Sam is known for.Serious Sam has always sort of been a wave based shooter. Because of that, it feels right at home here in VR. If you're a fan of Serious Sam or are just hearing about him, give this game a try. The devs are awesome and the game is as well.

I was expecting it to drop at around $20, so when it dropped at $40 I was rather suprised. But I figured that no matter what it's worth it.This is kind of where I'm wrong. The game is fantastic and holds the feel of the originals, but theres just a major lack of content for an EA game priced at $40. Of course, this is more than likely due to it being EA, but even if there were 5 different worlds it would still feel like theres a large lack of content for the price.I love the game, I really do. But being able to complete the first 2 worlds in around an hour, doesn't translate to a $40 experience for me.I may repurchase whenever it leaves EA and then goes on sale again, but right now, it's not worth their asking price IMHO.tl;dr as much as I love the game and the series, $40 is NOT worth it for a 1 hour experience."

The first few levels were a bit on the easy side but then comes the 4th Earth level which captures the essence of Serious Sam so good, I just got tingles down my spine just thinking about it. If the whole game was just that level, throwing more and more enemies at you, I'd be satisfied with the game.If you're not a fan of Serious Sam or if you haven't played it, this is a very nicely implemented wave shooter that keeps throwing more and more enemies at you with a distinct arcade feel to it that lets you dual wield rocket launchers. And miniguns.The gun selection is nice and there's a solid progression system in place in which you get more credits as you're killing things which allows you to buy new guns and ammo.The performance on my minimum spec is solid and there weren't any major issues although I did get some dips in performance on a particular map (2/4) on planet 2 when there were lots of dead enemies near me.The only complaint I have with the game is the system for changing weapons. You press the trackpad, the world slows down around you and you can choose a new weapon by pointing at a relatively little circle representing each weapon. It's a solid system but when things get chaotic, it feels kinda clunky.All in all, if you think dual wielding rocket launchers is fun, then this is the game for you.

With the vive controllers you feel like you are actually holding guns and firing them. Thankfully without the weight of holding two mini-guns. With monsters coming at you from all sides you can look and fire in different directions mow down enimies from both sides at once while having to maintain situational awareness over the entire field. Playing in standing mode is a serious work out as well and I don't think a video game as had my heart rate up that high before. You really feel like you are sam.Finished the first two levels and it just confirms the epicness of this game. The call out to the developers by the voice actor for Sam just adds to the immersion.

There are probably some new music tracks. To be honest it's hard to appreciate them when you are trying to shoot everything that moves and your eyes might as well be covered with ants, especially on hard difficulty.It's fairly stable as an early access game.

It's not just an interesting ormind blowing VR experience, it's an actual _game_ and a great one.If you are into FPS and a fan of the original SS you owe yourself to try this, you won't bedisappointed. In this early access version the game is still relatively small, but you areguaranteed hours of fun and a promise of even better things to come. Seeing that this iseasily one the very best games for the Vive available right now, I have no doubts the final gamewill be worth every penny I paid.Seriously (no pun intended), I don't think playing FPS on a computer screen will everbe the same... after holding one gun  on each hand, shooting at different directionssimultaneously and dodging bullets with your body, seated point-and-click shooting willlose a lot of appeal.Seriously recommended!"

(and makes the bow meaningful instead of being ""another weapon"")Also, Croteam's developer presence in the forums is really top notch.I think they may have overdid it though (coop mode shouldn't have been a priority)TL;DRThis game is a masterpiece made by people that knows what makes a good shooting game.And they used their knowledge and innovation to make a great VR game."

But the variety of guns, enemies and maps beats all other generic wave shooters right now. And that is just with 2 planets atm (exception on ZTS actually, ZTS has more guns I think). You can shoot projectiles which other wave shooters doesn't have, you can dodge them also as well.Sound: The iconic sounds of serious sam is in here so it is definitely a treat.Performance/PCMASTERRACE Options: Has waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more exposed options that you can tinker with.

I'm not even including the time spent in the menus and between levels. So a £30 game that can be completed within 3 hours, that's quite expensive in my opinion.There's certainly replayability with the challenge of the harder levels.

,Recommended,465240,35146840,Posted: 23 September,all,SilentCaay,"It's a wave shooter for VR and for some people, that's all that needs to be said. It is one of the better wave shooters but I can't say it's the single best one. Before Sam, I would have said Brookhaven was the best and Sam does do some things better than BH but BH still does some things better than Sam so there's no clear winner. Both are pretty good.The main difference between Sam and BH is that this is a bit more ""action hero"" with dual-wielding miniguns and firing from the hip with inifinite magazines while BH is a little more realistic with having to aim-down-sight, rewarding careful aiming and having to reload. (Also, the gun models are stupidly oversized in this but thankfully there's a scaling option. Set them around 75% to get them about normal.)One thing Sam has over BH is the monster variety and level design. Each wave here is a different map while in BH you use the same map for multiple waves. There are also unique monster types for each level in Sam while BH carries over most enemies throughout the game.One thing Sam does worse than BH, though, is the weapon purchasing system. You have 4 waves per level and you carry your purchases through the waves but not between levels so you always start wave 1 with starter gear and JACK ALL else then you buy one decent weapon for wave 2 and then it's wave 3 before you're actually outfitted in an over-the-top badass way that the game is going for. Hip-firing dual miniguns: awesome. Being forced to dual-wield little garbage pewpew pistols for half the game: not awesome.Overall, it's a great wave shooter but it's still just a wave shooter. If you want one of the best ones, though, go with this or Brookhaven."

I've been buying Croteams games since the Amiga days, and I was greatly looking forward to seeing what they would do for VR. To be critical, a wave shooter was not what I was hoping for, hoping for a more locomotion themed shooter, but within the bounds of the wave shooter genre (I guess it is a genre now, particularly on the vive) this is one of the best.Enemies only appear in front of you in roughly a 180 degree arc. I can see why they did this, both from an ease of porting to Oculus touch in the future, as well as keeping the action frantic, but still doable. 360 degrees would just decrease into a cable twisted mess, probably with me falling over and fracturing my skull. So thanks Croteam for not murdering me!I'm looking forward to seeing what the future of this early access title brings, this is one I'm confident will live up to the pedigree of the studio.

I even revisited BFE in the days leading up to this release just to ""get back in the groove"".  I have to be honest though, I really thought the lack of locomotion was going to be a showstopper for me.  What made all versions of SS so much fun was getting yourself into nearly impossible situations and having to systematically try different approaches to progress.  Saving your progress was mandatory because at some point you are going to die.SSVR is quite different for me so far.  My current plan of attack is the beat the two available worlds on easy first, which I accomplished last night in under an hour, and then return to try higher difficulty levels.  The initial loading screens are very cool and accessible, with a multitude of options available.  I was VERY happy to see that they kept the uber configurable performance options intact!  I would HIGHLY suggest that if you are just starting the game, go into graphics options and tweak.  Built in supersampling, multisampling, and dozens of other settings allow you to tune this game so that it looks great AND plays great.  Kudos Croteam!  From the moment you hear ""choose your weapons"" , you become Sam.  Seriously!  The weapons feel like an extension of yourself and the ""pick up and play"" gameplay mechanics are intact, which I feel is the best part about Serious Sam in general.  Within 30 seconds I was blasting the hell out of Mental like I'd been playing the game for years.  It just felt...natural.  And it was a blast, easily tops my list of VR experiences as the sense of presence is just fantastic.There are a few things I would like to see though since this is still Early Access.  There doesn't seem to be a logical progression through each world.  Each environment is very well rendered, but there is very little connecting one to the next, if anything.  What I would like to see is something like a fly over that give you a birds eye view of all playable ""episodes"" in that world so that you feel more connected with the environment.  With the elevator level in world 2 being the exception, the rest of them felt very disconnected.  There really isn't a whole lot tying one to the next, which I feel is a huge miss as it weakens the immersion.  My fingers are crossed that they can connect the environment a bit better to maintain a sense of immersion.  On a similar topic...content.  There really needs to be more environments on each planet so that it actually feels like a planet rather that a small island.  There really isn't much story line here at all and while the SS series really isn't about the story line, it at least adds a little bit to the immersion level of the game vs just feeling like a shooting gallery.Next, I would like to see them tweak the weapon and ammo loadout section a bit.  Right now your decisions seem to be final.  If you don't work the math correctly up front, you will be stuck with your decisions.  I would rather see more of a shopping cart approach where you see how much you can really buy, shuffle a few things around, and then make the purchase final.I am really looking forward to this title maturing and hope they can continue immersing us in Sam's world for years to come!"

I want to give this an ""eh?"".This is yet another VR shooting gallery. Yes, I know. However, it might just be one of the slickest in existence, with slick graphics, beefy guns and even decent use of vibration. It's very impressive. Moreover, dual-wielding miniguns is guaranteed to raise a smile, every time.However, there are some downsides, that prevent me from honestly giving this a thumbs up. Here come the cons!Gimmicky weapons. While the shooting is lots of fun with most of the weapons, there are stages where your weapon choice is artificially constrained to some terrible, annoying, gimmicky weapons, which are wonky and tedious to use. Specifically, the worst offenders are the terrible sword and awkward bow. The sword is clunky and inaccurate, intended to be used as a ranged weapon, firing off ""waves"" of energy. It's flaky and frustating, making little sense.. The bow suffers from the inaccuracy of VR bows (worse than the Valve bow in The Lab). It's even more annoying to use than the real thing. Two-handed weapons in VR always seem like a good idea, until you try to use them.On levels when you're forced to use the bow, I find myself not looking forward to the next wave, but hoping that it will be over soon, as it's so tedious. That's a really bad sign. Luckily, you're forced to use the sword a little less, but it's still crummy.I found the audio quite grating, it sounded like there was way too much dynamic compression, for loudness, a very tiring effect. I also couldn't find a separate voiceover level slider, to turn down the ""hilarious"" shouty narration. This was just clumsy.Finally, it's expensive. It's a relatively short and largely static shooting gallery, priced similarly to many AAA games. That's just too much. I'd suggest skipping this until it goes on sale- at a bargain price, it'd be fun enough to be worth a punt.So, while there are some things that I dislike about this game, and I certainly feel that it's overpriced, it still has its upsides. It's relatively slick and polished and.. two miniguns!However, the stupid wonky sword and clumsy bow are a tedious buzz kill. Without being forced to use those, I'd probably replay this game enough to get good at it on higher difficulties as it's slick and intense. However, as things currently stand, they make it a lot less fun. I'd probably mind a lot less if it weren't so expensive- it feels like a waste of money, and I don't think I can even refund now."

I feel it's always in my face! It distracts me.- Enemy's actually look cool from close range but shooting them in the distance is a bit meh.﻿- The place where the controllers are is not the place where the handles of the guns are, sometimes it's like i'm holding      the gun in the middle of it. A bit weird. But it doesn't bother me when shooting, aim is ok.- Put some big hands on those guns, and half an arm. It will add to the immersion. Tired of floating guns.-Everything that comes at you. Monsters, bullets, big rocks ect.. you hit it, even up close and it's almost like they evaporate.

Very extensive graphics options, so it can suit just about anyone's hardware. In Serious Sam style, it's definitely more about the gameplay than the plot. Gameplay is pretty challenging, even on Normal mode. Gunplay and enemy variety is nice.Though it is expensive, know that Croteam is a very experienced developer with quite a bit of experience and dedication to VR.

This is it, the high quality, highly polished game made by a big name developer we've all been waiting for. I have to admit, even with the hype of this game I had my reservation as someone who has grown tired of wave shooters. The hefty $40 price tag is nothing to scoff about either. So does it live up to the hype and value?Definitely yes, but I want to get one negative out of the way first. There are only 2 levels at the moment, and I've beaten both of them in under an hour. There are three difficulty, easy, medium, and hard. I finished all three difficulty for the first level and one difficulty for the second with a total of one and a half hours.Although it is short, you have to keep in mind it's not the full game. There are 3 more levels that is locked until it's finished with early access. But for the price I still think it's worth buying now. Even though it's short the value you are getting is not length of game, but the incredibly fun entertainment you get out of it on top of a highly polished and high quality game. I'm also glad to be able to play an early version of this now than have to wait until the product is finished. So don't think you are paying $40 for 2 levels. Think of is as paying $40 for an early access to a full game.Now with that out of the way, about the game...It's good. Like really good. You can instantly tell when the game loads that this is not an indie game. Everything about it feels like a game that's been made by veteran developers. No offense to indie games, they are a lot of good ones out there and I enjoy them very much, but this game just oozes high production value and quality. There's voice acting with Sam throughout the levels, something you don't get from indie games. And from the very first loading screen I was in awe with the graphics.Although there are only two levels, each one has three different areas. This game combines elements from two of my favorite VR games, Raw Data and Brookhaven Experiment. It has the graphic quality on par with Raw Data (some could argue it's even better) and the fun weapon upgrades of Brookhaven. I like that the game is only 180 degrees. For Brookhaven 360 is necessary to increase tension and scare factor, but for this game having to only worry about what's in front of you lets you focus on just having fun with all the action in front of you.Any weapon you buy you can hold on both hands, that's including the minigun and rocket launcher. They share ammo however, but you can hold different weapons on each hand as well. I just wish you get to keep the weapons you buy, because after you beat the level and replay it all the weapons have to be earned again.I would also like to see an endless wave survivor mode and a mode with unlimited ammo just so we can go crazy with the fun weapons. It would be nice to see temporary unlimited ammo or other power-ups in the normal game as well.I have no regrets buying this game now in early access with the entertainment I got out of it. In fact this game is so fun and accessible that it is now moved to the top of my list of games to demo to new people. I can't wait until the rest of the levels are released. I may wait until they all unlock to play it all at once, if I can resist waiting that long.Now that we finally have a game released by a big developer, we now have a taste of what's to come in the future. I am so excited for the rest of the big leagues to bring their AAA games. What a time to be alive!"

All the action is in front of you so those that have their Rift with Touch in the traditional setup, with both sensors in front of you, can play just fine.It's another wave based shooter, but it's definitely one of the best. It keeps the feel of the Serious Sam franchise with tons of enemies coming at you at once while having a large arsenal of weapons to fight back with. The graphics look great, with the enemies being some of the better looking ones I've seen so far in VR.I have a room scale setup, but could just as well as had standing only as I never moved around. I just naturally shot the projectiles coming at me rather than trying to dodge them.It's early access, so I'm sure it will be fixed before final release, but I have two main complaints: Playing a coop game wasn't straight forward, it took a little bit to figure out how to do. Secondly, in coop the other player is essentially a statue.

There's not really much dodging you can do but there are things like shields you can use in some levels. There are some boss fights but they're mostly just bullet sponges. You unlock cash for completing waves and use that to buy new weapons and ammo.

That's about it. Many have reported sore hands after playing this game (I can already see the lawsuits sweeping in for repetitive strain injury). There isn't much to this game, the only other thing it has going for it is the epic music, but I must conclude that Zombie Training Simulator is probably the better of the two since you can do more, such as pick up and throw meat to attract the horde and make them go kablooey with the grenades at your disposal."

The game works like this:- You spawn at a defined position, and start blasting away the monsters. After a while you have completed the mission- You return to the base and with the credits you earned you can buy yourself new fancy weapons.- You spawn in the next mission. During the missions ammo crates and health packs drop from the sky wich you can grab with your gun/controller (just dont do it while the horde is almost upon you, since it will prevent you from shooting with 1 gun during a second).- Etc.- Etc.The guns look great, are very responsive and the overall feel of the game is great. This is THE experience i'll use as a showcase for VR. You dont need a big room for this game, i've played it while standing in one spot all the game (well,.. i must admit i took a small step backwards when the horde was almost onto me).I can't wait to see where this game will go durings the further development.

You have to practially cross your eyes to keep an eye out on all the different targets.I found even the early rounds to be challenging as you have to select the right wepons for the job and the dexterity of your dominant and non-dominante hands.  Seeing huge weapons where your hands should be is satisfying and the sheer madness of multiple targets and incoming fire is ridiculous.This is one of the few VR games that gets your heart pumping and is just frustrating enough to keep you going."

Give me a breather, I've just killed a freaking GIANT MUMMY. But hey, the feels... the sounds, the tratta tratta of the approaching scheletons (and my archnemesis, the flying chain thingies), the AAAAAAAAAAA of the beheaded guys, the harpies... And it's only been the first world. The starting experience is truly fantastic.Croteam, I've always been a fan of your level of polish in your games. Seriously, thank you.--------------------------So, I've finished all the current content on easy and normal (on easy for medals). Now, I want to list the things which are in game right now. I will try to not express my opinion on whether or not I like it. Also be advised, that this is day 1 of early access, and many things might have changed in the future. I'm trying to avoid my opinion whenever possible.8 fully fleshed out levels, divided in two planets (three more planets currently shown as coming soon).3 difficulties, visibly tuned. I still have to check out Hard (and I'm a bit afraid, tbh), however easy and normal differ not only in monster health, but also in wave size. i.e., at the end of level 3 of world 2, you don't get mini-bosses and the boss. (it did seem like a bug though, because in other levels the bosses were all there.Between levels in a world, there's a shop where you can buy weapons, ammo and replenish health.Last level features a boss battle. It's tough.1 challenge per difficulty: do not die while completing a planet. That's 4 levels in a row. Even on easy, it's not entirely a walk. While I've completed world 1 with no problem (on easy), world 2 killed me during the boss battle. Will need to replay again. Seems a bit of a tuning issue, otherwise the easy mode is a walk.Some points about the game mechanics:You have 8 (I think) life points. Any damage will remove 1 point. Lose them all, you die.No armor.You can intercept ANY hit I've encountered so far. Even harpy shots, chains, lava, etc. Came a bit as a surprise to me, but I understand the reason behind it.If you have some space around (in your room), you can also dodge the shots.As a level 1 weapon (with infinite ammo), you get a pretty neat laser pistol. High rate of fire, but not very precise and apparently pretty low damage. Every other weapon requires separate ammo.In game, health and ammo are replenished through ""pulling up"" crates which fall down from the sky on a chute. Sometimes, you also get a crate with some currency (which you can spend after the level). Ammo crates have 20% of all ammo, health crates usually come with 2/3 HP.You have melee enemies, ranged enemies, flying enemies, projectiles, all moving in front of you in different patterns. So far I haven't seen any shenanigans from behind, but if you are focused on a side of a battlefield, the game will tell you there're enemies coming from the other side.If you want to switch weapon (through a handy menu), the time slows down. You can still dodge some shots, but it's better to hurry. If the ammo on your current weapon depletes, it automatically switches to another one. You can choose weapon for both hands separately.You need to complete a world in order to progress. There's a no save-load system, and if you leave, the progress will be lost (didn't try to force log out, but I have a bad feeling about this).Death in first level of a world will make you retry the level. Death in subsequent levels brings you from the shop, with a little bit more cash. This way you will be able to retry your way up, until eventually you have the firepower to overcome the level.That's kinda it in terms of features. Oh yes, no movement, apart from whichever space you have in your room.Since I've bought my Vive a couple months ago, I have tried a few ""FPS"" games out there: Space Pirate Simulator, Zombie Training Simulator, Raw Data, A Legend of Luca. Dunno if Vivecraft and The Lab count, but these too. Things to point out, compared to other games:Yes, it's a wave shooter. As EVERY other Serious Sam title is. It doesn't wait you to dispatch your previous wave though, and if it does, you don't feel it. The game uses a set of predetermined timers on when to spawn the next wave... and if you didn't make it in time to dispose of the preivious one... well, that's Serious Sam for you :DIt plays quite like Space Pirate Trainer, except you have an incredibly high enemy variety from get-go, and you have melee enemies.It doesn't play as Raw Data. Raw Data is the only title so far which I've refunded, and I cannot offer as much insight into comparison between these two games as I would want to. However, a big difference is that AI behavior is more predictable (but not easier), enemies have generally less HP, and of course you cannot teleport around, which I personally consider a plus. Less is more.It isn't very similar to Zomie Training Simulator. In terms of gameplay, in Serious Sam you rarely get to one-shot your opponents, besides in ZTS you stick to one weapon and interact with various objects. What's similar is that enemies' behave in predictable pattern, as well as come from an arc in front of you.Enemy variety is where the game currently truly shines. With a history such as Serious Sam's, there's a bestiary to pull from for ages. Only in the very first level I can mentally count 5-6 enemy types, and it gets better. There's a LOT of meat, which was always a highlight of the series. At one point I encountered an enemy which I'm not sure I've ever seen before (still, I played more Serious Sam 1 and 2, rather than later releases). An in-game database would be a nice touch, but I understand that this will come in the future updates.Another highlight of the game is its aestetics and performance. Yeah, you cannot break the glass (a shame), but you can throw down all the leaves from a palm tree. You also get to destroy rocks (flying at you) and make a lot of explosions. On my PC (GTX 1070 graphics, i5-3570, 8GB RAM) I have never experienced any framerate drop even during the busiest combat, with tons of particles/projectiles/enemies on the scr.... around me.Personal remark: level 3 of world 2 has terrible jokes. Besides, you aren't on a highway, only somehow on the side of it.Final verdict: This is day 1 of an ""Early Access"" title, yet I have played many released, ""done"" games which weren't even close to the level of polish this game has RIGHT NOW. Is it a bit barebones? Maybe, but the existent content is delivered at the highest level in the best spirit of SERIOUS SAM. Is it worth the current price? Every single penny, you will get the content you paid for, and even now that can mean hours of replayability."

(Select a planet, and you then play 4 stages in sequence, where you cannot change the order)As far as wave shooters go, I have tried just about every one out there, with one of my favorites being Space Pirate Trainer, but this easily jumps to near the top of my list. I found all the weapons to be quite solid and fun to use, seriously, just pull out the chainsaw and try not to smile. All the levels are detailed and interesting to look at, with quite a few destructible items in each environment. There is no movement system at all, so you will not be teleporting around, and generally you will not be dodging bullets either, almost all incoming fire is quite large and you defend yourself by shooting enemy bullets. That may sound simple at first but even the normal difficulty mode gave me a run for my money.Combat also takes place in a 180 degree area, you don't need to worry about enemies popping up behind you, but you will often be dealing with things coming from every other angle on the ground and in the air.Everything has really high level of polish for what is here, I only ran into one bug I can think of (time slows down when you open your weapon selection, and I found on some occasions this would not happen) and I will be really excited to receive more, it took me about 2 hours to clear the two stages on normal difficulty.I definitely will revisit the game many times to clear hard setting on the two levels, I imagine it will take me a bit of time to accomplish that, however once you clear everything, you may find that the game does not have the highest replayability value at the moment. Perhaps retrying a stage with different weapon loadouts can provide unique challenges, except that currently you can only really fully customize your weapon loadout by the fourth stage in the two levels, as you need to earn cash on the prior stages. I really wish there was some way I could start a level with a bigger loadout.Because you are not able to start with many weapons, the difficulty on the stages ramps up considerably from one stage to the next as you are able to afford additional weapons. Personally I would rather all stages have similar difficulty and challanges and again, options to have a bigger weapon loadout on each stage.Finally, I don't believe there is anything to worry about for future content patches. These developers have shown many times how much they care for their fanbase, and have a pretty decent record of delivering high quality and more importantly fun content.It is Early Access in the end though, so if you want to have a full experience and not be stopped just as you are getting started, you may want to wait for more content to come out.Personally, I wanted to support their work in VR as soon as I could, so I jumped on the bandwagon right away, and overall, I am not dissapointed!"

Picking the right weapon is also important and a nice touch. The higher graphics settings are really taxing on your system unless you have something top of the line, I would recommend medium or low depending on what you have.

The first really big AAA VR game by a respected studio set in a beloved franchise.  I installed eagerly.  I demolished waves of bad guys gingerly.  It was a sublime 90 minutes, and then the game came to an abrupt end.  That's about the same length of gameplay you used to get on one of the free demo floppy disks that came with PC Gamer in the early 90's, except this one costs $40 ($32 on sale).  I'm not sure that's the 90's nostalgia Croteam was going for.  Apparently I completely missed the whole ""Early Access Game"" thing.Despite my tremendous disappointment with the limited gameplay, what's here makes for an amazing demo.  As a finished game, this would certainly be worth $40.  I guess now I just have to wait for the game to be finished."

Handling of the weapons feels so natural you’ll find yourself wanting to feel the weight. :DIt’s also very hard, you’ll most likely die before even seeing the boss at normal difficulty. I wish there was a checkpoint after the elevator in level 2-3.Compared to Space Pirate Trainer, the angle at which enemies can appear/move to feels slightly lower. I find this to be more fun, because it’s very Serious and the shooting gallery looks more like a regular FPS level. However, there is less incentive to keep playing because equipment is reset every time you start a “campaign” and there’s no other type of persistent score.Also, because the Vive is relatively low-res, it gets very hard to hit or even see enemies that are far(-ish) away."

,Recommended,465240,26094281,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,pr1mary_c1l1um,"After playing this when it first came out, briefly checking in again after an earlier update, and then letting it sit for a long while, I'm suprised at how complicated it's gotten. Melee weapons, a bow, a shield, weapon upgrades, and a skill tree? This is Serious Sam?I appreciate what Croteam is going for here - VR wave shooters are pretty shallow and SS deserves better. What they've decided to do is raise the bar for player performance, which can be pretty rough. It means you need to practice and learn through failure to get good at the game. That takes some of the fun out of it, but it's a crazy and intense action experience regardless. If you want to have an easier time, you can just lower the difficulty.I originally gave a thumbs down because the amount of content didn't justify the price. I think there's enough content here now considering it's high quality, but I'm not really excited about what the game has become since my assumption when I bought on day 1 was a wild shooting romp, not an intense challenge.I only recommend if you want your skills pushed to the limit!WARNING: there are now a couple levels that may induce motion sickness in especially sensitive people.OLD REVIEW:After playing the Shaanti update, I can see what Croteam is going for here a bit better. The new levels are harder on ""normal,"" thereby forcing a certain amount of learning and planning to survive. That makes it pretty deep for a wave shooter. This isn't really ""replayability,"" but it does extend the entertainment for those who strive to overcome some frantic challenges. When showing the game to friends I've turned the difficulty down to easy so they at least have a chance to kill some guys.In addition to the new planet, the update added a sword, shield, and sniper rifle. I feel like Serious Sam should be philosophically opposed to using a shield, but in the new levels there are clearly situations where it is necessary. The sword doesn't really seem to fit either until you discover it can very efficiently clear waves of enemies at a distance.I'm going to leave my review as a thumbs down for now since I still feel the price is too high for the current content. Perhaps this was a missed opportunity for Croteam to sell the base game for a low price and then each planet as a DLC. Tough to figure out the VR economy right now.Thanks for the reply to my original review, Eagleshadow!WARNING: The new final level may induce motion sickness in especially sensitive people.ORIGINAL REVIEW:It's certainly not worth the money right now - I finished it in about 45 minutes. I'll change my review if I become satisfied with the amount of content.I'm a big fan of Serious Sam and this game keeps the familiar graphics and enemies. Unfortunately, it's missing the movement - circle strafing and running backwards are staples of Serious Sam fighting, but that's not possible in VR, even with roomscale. What you're left with is holding down the triggers and pointing your arms at the nearest enemy. It's amusing for a little while, but quite shallow. I basically only used the machine gun-type weapons - I didn't see how the shotguns would even be useful here since waiting for an enemy to get close is just begging to get hit since you can't really dodge. Hopefully Croteam finds a way to improve this experience."

,Recommended,465240,35172624,Posted: 23 September,all,pH. Jin_D3vil,"A very fun Serious Sam VR experiance that I recommend if you are a fan of the Serious Sam games and it's specific type of action based humour with large hordes of enemies to cut down.While it doesn't work like the other games before it, as it's pretty much just a static horde shooter. It does however provide an instantly familiar and enjoyable Serious Sam experience with really fun weapons that will be instantly familiar to any Serious Sam fan. The feeling of standing your ground and unload on the mass of enemies like the headless kamikaze's and other classics like the Kleer or the Clones is immensely satisfying. They either explode, crumble into piles of bones or just lumps of meat around you and it's easy to just feel all powerful as heck. I'd be suprised if this game didn't put a smile on your face as the shooting is incredibly accurate and when you get to the point of being able to just quickly aim and shoot without having to look too much, you'll feel incredibly satisfied by how awesome you are as Serious Sam himself.The weapons are essentially bought mid levels and supplied before playing, so there is very little added mid levels. But the game has 'drops' in the form of parachutes that will replenish all weapons ammo (by 25% by time of writing), health and give money (it also replenishes shields in multiplayer). This allows you to risk taking in a costly weapon load out without full ammo, and rely on the drops to allow you to use it all. It can be risky as heck I'll warn you, but if you fail a few times you'll get a good idea of what to expect as it doesn't change every time you play, so you can adapt your load out every retry to suit what happens. There's a lot of satisfaction in dual wielding weapons in this game, you select what weapon to have equipped at any time and can wield the same weapon in each hand or use a different one in each to allow a different strategy (plus you don't use twice the ammo when wiedling different ones). For example the chainsaw is as large as you are and it's incredible to swing around in VR and feel all powerful to any enemies that get close as they are oblitirated. This saves ammo on other weapons and means you can also focus off from what's near and kill some thing else.The core of the shooting is a mix of precision and spam. The smart use of weapons and focusing pick-ups is key. Too much spam will reduce your ability to react and take on larger assualts and too little will leave you exposed to attacks while also trying to kill enemies. I can't recommend the Assault Rifle enough, it's incredibly usable and accurate with the laser sight. Dual wielding them is a very effective means to take out multple targets and nullify enemy attacks, with practice you can nail a lot of things at once with minimal eye tracking and it's an incredible feeling to just oblitirate so many headless kamikaze's while sweeping the horizon.The only thing's I can say that you'll find issue with is that the game is incredibly close to you. The menu's are far too close for comfort and I'd recommend stepping back a little from the centre of the room to get a decent perspective. Too far however may make it too easy as the focus of the enemy is within the front 110-130 degree's of view (they do go behind if you let them however). So you don't want to go too far back otherwise it'll make it far too easy to see everythigng and that will just ruin the fun.The other thing is, be mindful while you will feel amazing and all powerful. Do not pose and strut at the enemies, this does not translate well outside in the real world at all. :P"
