,Recommended,465360,23242357,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,DarkStarSword,"This is a little gem from 1997 and it's a really awesome and unique 3D first person action / RTS hybrid. I originally played the demo when I was growing up, which only had 2 maps (this version has 20), but the game was that good and innovative that I must have played those maps dozens of times each!Major con: This game likes to crash. A lot. And if memory serves this was true in 1997 as well. I mean seriously, how did they ever release it like this? As a programmer I know that memory corruption bugs can be damn hard to track down, but jeez! Just make sure you save fairly often (at the very least after every mission) and you won't lose too much progress. Mostly I only lost a minute here or there, though I did lose an entire mission when it crashed right as I won :(The single player campaign took me 17 hours to complete every mission, which is a pretty decent amount of content for it's time. It's possible to skip some missions or play them in a different order, so it could probably be done in less time if you rush. The difficulty curve is good - the earlier missions should ease you into the game, while some of the later missions really keep you on your toes and you really can't let your guard down. I tried doing one of the missions earlier than I should have, and was absolutely creamed as neither I nor my support units could take down any of the enemy turrets. Went back and did a few other missions to get some better tech and had a... less difficult time.Since the game is pretty unique, I'll go over it's gameplay a little:You directly control a one of a kind souped up Tank (The Wraith) on the battlefield, but you also call in support units as you need them. But, unlike other strategy games, most of the support units (except the Bomber) teleport directly to your location allowing you to instantly deploy a formidable army whenever you need it, and periodically reinforce it. When you've finished blasting whatever it was to smitherines, you simply recycle the units to recover their resources so you can deploy them again elsewhere (or not, if you would rather leave them to defend the area or just have plenty of resources to spare).You capture Citadels in the game, which are huge towers with big guns that serve as your bases. They are capable of defending themselves, but you will often need to take direct control of them when they come under attack (which leavs your Wraith vaulnerable, but doing so automatically raises it's shields to maximum and it can take quite a beating). This also allows you to easily deploy more units and turrets around the Citadel to help defend it, even though you might be way over the other side of the map.Given it's from 1997 you will have to spend some time rebinding the controls to modern best practices (and turn that damn mouse acceleration off and bump the sensitivity up to max), but that's all doable. The main changes I had to make was WASD for movement, TAB for overhead map, Q to control a Citadel, R to recycle a unit. Cycle power triangle is fine on C, but learn to use it effectively! I set my mouse wheel to generate [ and ] to switch secondary weapons, though you can use the number row for some of them as well. I left the unit deploy keys as F1-F7 even though they are a little awkward because I'm still used to them being that from 1997.Minor con: This was one of the earliest 3D DirectX games and the draw distance sucks as a result. You can raise it in the settings a little, but even the max is still pretty low. I find this more annoying than the low resolution, especially when you know there is an enemy building just out of the draw distance from a Citadel and if only you could see where it was you could eliminate it from a distance..."

I can remeber getting a demo on PC Gamer around the same time that Battlezone was released, its just one of those demos that you just play over and over again even though youve completed everything on it.

,Recommended,465360,23086702,"Posted: 19 May, 2016",all,CommissarBRO,"This game was and still is my♥♥♥♥♥♥ Probably my favorite example of the Action/RTS genre... a clean blend of shooter mechanics with easy call in units and bases that provides enough of a challenge to be exhilarating but not impossibly difficult. Warning: I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game so I'm a bit biased.Uprising Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C98-EARNPwwExplained shortly, Uprising is a game where you control a command tank called a Wraith. This wraith has over a dozen different weapons with power systems that allow you to allocate more power to weapons, shields or speed. The Wraith is also able to call in units (anywhere you're looking) and buildings (on black/yellow control pads) which require resources that are mined by ""Power Facilities."" All units and buildings are upgradeable with credits earned for every battle won. You move around the battlefield, blasting away enemy targets (Native, Imperial factions) and taking over their control points by claiming them with ""Citadels"" (♥♥♥♥normously large towers that violate enemy forces). Your overall goal is defeat the Imperials and establish a new order of freedom and happiness... or something like that. What's REALLY important is all the♥♥♥♥♥you're going to kick in the Wraith.In summation, it's dated, the graphics aren't the best (I've always enjoyed those old 3dfx games) but the gameplay shows a genre that could've become popular but never really did."

Downloaded, installed and started to play. It was literally awesome, because i had interests in high strategic space games where you build bases, and go from planet to planet and unlock new stuff.Even tho i didn't understand English at that time, i knew how to play this game anyway so i guess i was lucky enough lol. But yeah i played this game literally every freaking day in our old♥♥♥♥♥computer Intel Premium 2 PC. Loved it. When i got here in Finland and we had new comps, i forgot the game's name until 2014 i found it again, but it didn't support our OS's. Now when i bought it i remember the good old times and it works perfectlyWhat's this game about?This strategic space game is about a heroir Commander who's controlling a high developed tank called ""The Wraith"" that was stolen from the Evil government and dominator of the Galaxy, the ""Imperial government"" or just ""Imperium"". It has dominated the galaxy and its emperor is a pure tyrant and oppressor of every nation in the galaxy.You are playing as ""The Allies"" or just ""The Resistance"". Your mission is simple. Its to engage all hostile planets that your high command has targeted for certain achievements. Remember however, after you done a mission, you will get money that you can use on upgrades. Firstly upgrade your buildings and allies, then weapons (My recommendation)What's your mission and your baseAs i said your mission is simple. Engage all the hostile planets on your map. You're gonna navigate the planet surface with ""The Wraith"" assault tank. Your tank is the main mobile command center on the battlefield, and its filled up with many defensive systems and many variety of different weapons, but you cannot defeat an enemy world all alone.To conquer a world, you will be deployed to the surface and entering hotzone at the planets of each map. You're gonna have to call in a base, also knows as ""Citadels"" in the enemy planet surface. Remember, that every citadel costs 900 Z and other buildings have their price too!Once you've called in a citadel in the hotzone, you are able to call in variety of factories, such as barracks, which provide troops, tank factories, which provide tanks, AAV (Jets/fighters) facilities, that provide jets/fighters, Bomber facility, which provides bombers, Power plants, that provides you with the resources, aka money to build and call allies, and K-SAT. I will explain below what they are.The buildings and the armyThe main building you're gonna need when you enter a hotzone, is the Citadel. It is a high tower that serves at the defense system to your buildings and as the main power of  your base and the army. It is armed with 2 high and powerful cannons that will shoot up big laser blasts at the enemies when its engaging. It stands still however. When citadel is called, you can call in 3 watchtowers, which are Turrets and SAM sites. F5 calls in Turrets, which only work against ground targets, and F6 calls the SAM sites that destroy any flying object they see. Effective against AAV's and Bombers. The more citadels you have, the more power you can generate. The more units you can deploy, and the higher chance is for you to winning the war.Now the barracks. Barracks, is the building that produces troops/soldiers. They can produce 4 troops at a single tap of F1, while others spawn only one at a tap. They are weak on the battlefield, but they are effective against structures in the planet, because they can move to a building, place mines and do high damage to the enemy buildings and destroy them if success. Use them against buildings when no one is nearby. If you dont want them to die, press the ""Del"" keybind on your keyboard to save them after they placed a mine. Pressing the delete keybind when you are looking at a building or an allie, it removes them.The tank factories. Tank factories produce tanks, which are easy to destroy, but they can draw enemy fire away from you and destroy ground and air targets if they can. Use them against enemy turrets and ground/air forces that are attacking youThe AAV facility. Its basically what calls the jets/fighters in. AAV's are excellent because of their speed of attacking. They can easily destroy bombers and AAV's and any ground targets they find, but they are weak against enemy SAM sites and ground cannons. Use them when there's not any SAM sites or ground cannons nearbyThe Bomber facility. It provides you with bombers. Bombers are the main thing you wanna call in after you called your citadel. They are highly effective against structures and huge cannons, because they drop off bombs that deal high damage and can destroy anything, but are really and really weak against AAV's and SAM sites. Use them against structures and remember to upgrade them first when you have enough money.Power plants. Power plans provide you with the money thats in the game. Its just like $, but instead of S it has Z. Its the ig money basically. Power plants will provide you with money. When they have stopped pumping, that means you reached the limit of the power plant. Call in power plants to get money fastThe K-SAT. K-SAT aka Killer Satelite. Its available in the upgrades. K-SAT, is the weakest base building in the game, but its highly effective against anything. You're gonna need 2 power plants in the planet to call in a K-SAT building. When the meter is full, and you press F7, it will call in a huge beam/laser that will destroy anything instantly. Very effective when attacking enemy bases and citadels. Look at an enemy citadel and call in a K-SAT attack and you're gonna enjoy destroying enemy bases! Use it against citadels mainlyThe enemiesAfter the training, you will probably say ""Ahhh its so easy!"" but nope. Dont get too excited. The simulation provides native forces, that are indigenous to the planet, and they already have their factories, cannons/turrets and etc all over the planet. The second faith that you'll face, are the forces of the Imperial government. And they must establish citadels and factories just as you do. They are your sworn and deadliest enemies in the game. They will do anything to destroy you by ambushing, or suddenly making attacks. Remember however, that they can spawn at ANY of your bases, but you cannot do the same on them. You're gonna have to attack them using your tank and calling in your allies. Remember, that Native forces and Imperial forces are friends and they will go against you at any cost. Good luck in the game10/10 GG"

It's graphics and gameplay was like nothing made before. This set the bar for many RTS games to come.I lost my original disc and couldnt find an English version online. To my luck i found this on steam. This game features everything the original had and at a very cheap price.The only down side is that sometimes it crashes during gameplay. I have only played the training missions and 1 campaign mission. It crashed multiple times but I think if you are careful and don't click or hit esc whilst its loading or try to alt-tab etc. It should minimize the amount of crashes.tl;dr:Game is good but it crashes sometimes.P.S This worked on my Windows 7, idk bout Windows 10 :/"
,Recommended,465360,23253332,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,☣ Broken Ninja ☠,"This is one of the founding fathers of the FPS/RTS hybrid type games. You play as an advanced Wraith Hover Tank. You have a large arsenal of weapons you can upgrade to as you play through each Planetary & Solar System campaign, you build & defend your bases and call in units whether they be infantry, tanks, aav or bombers on the fly as you conquer through each map. Not bad for a nearly 20 year old game... wait... what? I just realized how old it was... im gettin' old... *facepalm*Bought this to see if it was finally optimized to at least play on Windows 7. While it does, its definitely a dated classic. I own the disc version, but had to make some tweaks with that version to get it to play stable enough where it wouldnt CTD (crash to desktop) every 10 minutes or have random UI glitches just like its sequel Uprising 2 Lead & Destroy had. With this version its the Software mode version, not the 3dfx Glide version with smoother textures. However I do have nGlide installed and even though its running software mode by default it picked up the nGlide wrapper which was cool and possibly gave the steam version a little more stability.As is, this game series was a cult classic, not widely popular except to those who found it. The only con I can truly say I wish couldve been fixed, was the clunk mouse movement for aiming. There has been no way to fix this manually, it feels like im using an old ball mouse and it rollers are all junked up and sticking making it look like my mouse movements are getting stuck every so often.Edit - This Gamer came out of no where and fixed the problem I had for a long time. ""DarkStarSword - Mouse aiming is easy to fix - in the controls menu set the acceleration slider all the way down and the sensitivity slider all the way up."""

Works okay on Windows 10 x64 (had to install DirectPlay Windows Feature) - crashes once in a while mainly when pressing F9 to quick save. Other than that, works okay on my modern system and brings back memories. Thanks to whoever got this ported and on Steam. I had the old CD and was using a Win98 VM previously to get this working but couldn't get the 3DFX Wrapper working properly so this on Steam for under $5 was awesome since it works right out of the box. :)"

Totally worth.All units and the main tank are upgradeable. Different types of terrain to play in a long single player campaign. Many types of weapon and the fight for resources against the enemy makes it one of the most trepidant and rich games I´ve ever played.

It is exactly how I remembered it!  Of the 400 games in my steam library, that this is the one I am daydreaming about while at work in my office chair blows my mind.  So excited, lived up to all of my expectations, and I plan on putting many many more hours into it soon!I am running Windows 10, and the game booted up fine for me, however I was experiencing the same issue some people are having with the ""esc"" key (main menu) crashing the game.  My was of living with this bug is to plainly start a mission and test the esc key immediately.  If it crashes, restart and try again.  But when it works... it works the whole time you are in your mission, and you can save regularly (I did not use the quick save option).
