76561198047577036,Not Recommended,465430,29017370,Posted: 4 January,all,Superdarkpit,"Honestly, I don't know why this game has so many positive reviews in its current state. I'll go into more detail, butTL;DR: It's a buggy mess.Pros:- Walking locomotion.- Optional teleportation locomotion.- Actual levels, as opposed to the all too common wave shooters- Other, interesting forms of locomotion, such as ladders, monkey bars, and  ziplines- Intersting mood, akin to Portal. Wandering around an abandoned facility while reading and listening to comically sinsiter announcements, like ""There should not be trees in the facility; if you see one, get on the floor immidaitely and report it to your supervisor.""- Actually sort of scary. For how simple the art style is you wouldn't think so, but there were actually a few times when monsters appeared and I panicked.Cons:- Lots of things have no hitbox. Like, everywhere. This means you can clip through a whole bunch of random objects that should either kill you (like cars) or prevent you from getting somewhere (like a 3 foot wall). Sure, I can scale a 3 foot wall in real life, so it's not like it actually prevents me from getting somwhere, but I go *over it*, not straight through it. There are also weird random section of floor that you can clip through and then fall into places you aren't suppoed to get to. And I don't mean that in the ""you can skip parts of the game"" way, I mean in the ""You can get stuck in a deep pit"" kind of way.- The game design is sometimes confusing and unclear. An example: There's a gate that I can't open; the button is on the other side. Well, I've got this handy teleporter on me, I'll just use tha-- no? Okay. Oh I found a gun. Maybe I can shoot the butto-- no? Okay? Oh, I have to stick my hand *through* the bars and then shoot the button. Okay....Why?- The combat is okay, in theory, but the way it's executed favors walking up to an enemy and swinging your baton wildy until it dies. The way it should work is that you and enemies can block each other's gun shots with the baton and fire where there's an opening. You could do that... or just walk up to it and shake your arm around like a mad man for about 3 seonds and it dies.- Lags whenever there's too much motion on the screen. And by too much I mean about 2 objects.Basically, this game has a few good ideas and does them well, but from a technical standpoint, it's confusing, laggy, and worst of all, buggy. They have these teleportation pod that you walk into and you come out another pod somehwere else on the map. Literally the first time i ecnountered one of these I was stuck in a loop where I would show up at the other teleporter and then get teleported backto the first one and vice versa so forth. It's got some good potential, but as it stands, I wouldn't even play this for free because bugs like that seemed to be commonplace in the 1.5 hours I played. Yes, it's that annoying."

Releasing a fleshed out Demo prior to lauch to let consumers test the product prior to purchasing the full release.2. Fully developing and polishing the title PRIOR to release and communicating delays.3. Pricing the final product to match exactly what the content provides.The game itself is visually simplistic in its delivery but that does not retract from the immersion or gameplay experience.  It complements the sound design perfectly.My early impressions after completing the first few levels are unmatched.  Without giving too much away I'll say that there are a number of mechanics included in this game I have not expereinced in other VR titles and the passion these developers have for VR is seething through this game.Grab Vertigo if you have a Vive, you will not be disappointed.WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"

,Not Recommended,465430,31586668,Posted: 6 May,all,Runkly,"Oh, Vertigo. I want to recommend you. I do. In fact, I actually enjoyed my time with this game somewhat. I don’t really write reviews, but this game made me feel I had to. It had fun moments and neat things throughout to discover. But there's so many bugs and other inconsistencies that made this difficult to play, let alone enjoy, without becoming frustrated. But I did anyway because I desperately wanted it to be good.The GoodIn fact, let's start off with the good. I understand why this must've been difficult to produce, being made by basically only a couple guys. That in mind, the scope of the campaign and some of the detail that went in is impressive when compared to many of the other VR titles on the market. I enjoy a lot of the small things like the diaries and the bits of story throughout the environment, though it could be more fleshed out.Gameplay-wise, I like the explorable levels and puzzles instead of shooting waves of enemies. It's a very welcome change of pace from most VR games. It felt cool sneaking up on some enemies and taking them by surprise in a corridor. The weapons and equipment you find are also introduced at a nice pace, adding variation as you progress to make things a bit less stale.The style, models, and level design are pretty good. Could use some more variation in certain places (I’m talking about you, muted green hallway mazes). Some of the animations are also super janky, like when bots are running in a certain direction but shooting at you though their own bodies,or like that entire ending with the face hand guy and his limbs breaking and clipping though himself,but I can overlook that since most of it's simple enough to get the job done and look relatively convincing. However basic things seem in certain areas, the world maintains a consistent look and feel to it that, while I feel like I've seen it in a few places before, is at least fairly decent. I like the general feel, though sometimes it seems to pull stuff right from Aperture Science. But it's a nice little mix of creepy and ominous surroundings with some humor sprinkled in to ease the tension, what with the comical announcements you hear throughout the facility.The BadBut that also brings me to some of my negative criticism. The game can’t seem to decide how serious or not serious it wants to be. For example, there’s terminals in the game where there seems to be people inciting drama and conspiring to do questionable things in the facility. Serious things. Bad things. And yet, there’s a point where there’s a panel of buttons in an area that you expect to affect the environment or something. But it instead turns out to literally just be a soundboard of various “funny” sound effects (cat meowing, a guy saying “MOO”, etc.) and it just comes off as very random and out of place, even in the somewhat comedic setting they’ve had till that point. There’s dark humor and drama that you can effectively combine into something interesting but that’s not really to be said here. At best, it’s a joke that kinda missed its mark. At worst, it’s an inconsistent atmosphere and setting. In general the writing could've been better, but again, with the game being developed by two people, I can understand focus on areas deemed more important to them, so that’s why I’m not too critical here.Writing aside, we get to gameplay. At the beginning, they tell you that you can exclusively use your little teleporter gun to get around if you choose and that you don’t have to use the somewhat awkward “point and slide” locomotion system. Wrong. The shield is essentially a requirement so that you don’t get killed by incoming laser shots, but since the baton is extremely short ranged and you can’t use it simultaneously with the shield since it’s the same item with a toggle, you feel forced to use the gun/shield combo at almost all times for a huge chunk of the game. Not to mention your tele-gun seems painfully slow to use in comparison, so whipping it out in combat with the clunky menu just doesn’t really work without getting you killed. So if you get motion sick with sliding around (luckily I don’t, but my friend did), you can forget using the tele-gun most of the time. I feel it’s strangely underutilized and the game is not built much with it in mind.The maps. They’re good. And bad. As I said, I like exploring, but not when it’s in what basically amounts to an empty warehouse. Due to the painfully slow tele-gun, again, if you don’t like sliding around, you’ll have a bad time traversing open areas to get to objectives. In fact, you won’t have a great time with it even using the faster movement system. For a game that seems to encourage exploration, it’s not exactly easy to explore. Often times you have to take slow lifts to certain places or climb up or down ladders to reach different floors and slowly find what you’re looking for. Then you trod back to the lifts again, walk a mile and a half of open ground to get to another doorway or a teleporter booth. You’ll have a hard time using the booth since the doors on them quickly swing closed on their own.Oh, and if you get in one, there’s a chance it's bugged and you get stuck in a teleport loop that you might fix by flailing your baton at the doors to get one to swing open, only to realize thatthe door is now stuck slightly open so it no longer will activate.This issue could've been fixed with a button in the booth that you press to reset the doors and activate the teleport or something. Just requiring user input in some way would alleviate the problem, but it’s so persistent and makes me afraid to use teleporters.I’m also afraid to use lifts because I know if I die and start from my last checkpoint, the lift may not be in its starting position. Now keep in mind, in some cases, this is no problem since there’s a button to call the lift back. But some liftssimply do not have this.And it’s a big problem for finishing a level. If you die, there’s a chance you can’t reach an area you were at but didn’t complete the task in. Which means you have to quit to the main menu to reset the map. Which means have fun starting the level over from the very beginning, becausecheckpoints are only in effect for your current session on that level!Another problem with inconsistent behavior and design that makes playing feel extremely tedious.When I got this months back, I saw these bugs and checked the forums and r/vive and saw the devs were aware of these issues and said that they'd be addressed. I’m glad they didn't outright ignore it. But coming back and finishing it months later, these same bugs persist. I don’t doubt they put in passion and effort. Devs get busy with other things. But I don’t feel this game qualifies as “done”. It’s disappointing that they seem content to move on to Vertigo 2 and not fix problems with this game that can, at times, make it unplayable. The experience could've been much smoother, weird design choices aside.TL;DRVertigo is a game that has potential to be something more. Decent gameplay, puzzles, actual levels to explore, and things to find make you want to know more about how you ended up here. But being plagued with bugs and several poor/strange design choices that make playing feel like a chore, it doesn’t amount to much more than some interesting concepts with poor execution. If they gave themselves more time or developed a bit more under Early Access before a full release, this could've been one of the best VR titles. But right now, it’s a game the just seems to fall short in too many areas. I’d love to change this review to positive. In fact, I don’t like calling  this review outright negative, but hey, that’s Steam. I hope the devs can prove me wrong with a future patch and turn this into a much more enjoyable experience. But for now, I remain disappointed in knowing that I could have enjoyed this a lot more than I did."

When I first purchased this game, I played through the first 20 minutes or so of it and then stopped. I do not remember why but I just wrote the game off as weird and different. Then I decided to give it another go. I played through the entire game in one day. I could not stop. It was so fun and different and weird and I loved it. I have never had a VR experience as great as this one. The weirdness and differentness of this game is what makes it so beautiful and amazing. If you've read this far into my review and not bought this game yet, what the heck are you doing!?! play this masterpiece! You will not regret it.

I spent +6 but because I was stuck in a couple of situations (beware, at the moment checkpoints are not save points, only elevators are). Without spoilering, ending is original and stylish. The closest thing to Budget Cuts I've played in seven months.-----What an adorable game! Vertigo is actually a real adventure so the focus is not just on action like almost everything on VR. Difficulty level is pretty demaning, checkpoints are far and bosses hard to beat.I can play with artifical locomotion but Vertigo's teleport is just wonderful, it's the closest thing to Budget Cuts avaliable at the moment (including stealth situations and preview of the arrival point). If you've some space in you chaperone, teleport + real world walking/leaning/crouching/climbing (Climbey style) is the real deal.We are trained to a low content/cost ratio on VR, Zulubo opted for a very friendly price instead. They give us demos from ages (customers, let's support teams than offered a demo!). They're very active and kind in the community. This game deserved to be bought."

(Can you say so in English? Thing you know what I mean...)Thank you devs for such a great christmas present!! After some very long weeks of waiting (after playing the demo) it is finally there and  it is great! For me thist is for sure one of the best games in VR if not the best. The possibilities of movement work perfect for me, the atmosphere is very sci-fi like (whith a little bit of Half-Life feeling for me) and everything works great without any bugs (at least as far as I have played, this is abot an hour). Did somebody else notice the rattling of the elevator doors? Just a small thing that adds to the great atmosphere.

You can choose between teleporting or manual walking, which for some is fantastic news. The game offers a tutorial in the main menu, but there is no form of tutorial in the campaign, so be sure to play that first.Within the first hour of gameplay, there was a really fantastic mechanic used that I am shocked other VR games haven't taken advantage of. I won't specify what that is for the sake of keeping it a surprise, but it happens near an elevator.I haven't really gotten to fighting yet, so I can't comment on that.My two very personalized two cents: the demo was fantastic when it came out, and the boss fight was like nothing I had ever seen before in VR at the time. The full game so far feels very polished and professional, and for under 20$, I'm very comfortable in saying that you will feel like it was well spent. Give it a VertiGO!"

Yes, there might be a few minor bugs here and there, but it's currently the BEST singleplayer VR experience. From soundtrack giving me goosebumps to absolutely stunning gameplay and graphics. I'm a huge fan of the music, so I bought the OST pack as well to support the developer and the artist.I beat the game in 5 hours, however it's really good value for the price. Definitely worth it. Story is unclear and random from times to times. Even though the story isn't very clear, I believe it's intentional due to you're lost in this huge facillity in an another reality/dimension and this is only chapter one. (Yes, it's confirmed that there will be a sequal)  The ending really surprised me, in a good way. Credits and end scene... totally awesome!The bosses are fantastic. Every boss are different and have unique techniques so you are forced to change your playstyle which is awesome. (Yes there are a few bosses) Puzzles are great and fun to do. Got stuck sometimes, but found a solution after searching around.Movement is good as well. Gives the player the choice to teleport or/and walk. Weapons are really cool and nice lookin'.In conclusion, this game is a must buy for every Vive (and maybe oculus if the game supports it). The pricing is ridiculously good, so I don't see a reason to not buy the game. You bought a headset for possibly 800+ dollars. Currently one of my favorite VR experiences."

I've enjoyed every minute of it so far and I know this will be a game I complete quickly which isn't always the case with VR.  The story is somewhat humourous and the game really has some character which is nice to see.  The first boss arring was a pretty cool moment and there's a good atmosphere to the game.The mechanics are relatively simple but satisfying and well put together.  My only complaint is that the teleport is so slow to operate, I was playing with the locomotion option which seems very easy on the stomach but I can imagine if I was playing with the teleport I'd be a bit frustrated at the speed I was able to teleport.  I understand it's a mechanic of sorts, I just think if people want to teleport let them do it freely otherwise it can get a bit annoying having a delay all the time.For £10.99 this seems like a bargain, much more of a game than other releases for far more money.  One of the outstanding VR games so far without a doubt."

I encountered only two bright, white light in one area and finger bone bug, which i had to google to get past.The end. I would have liked a boss fight"

This game is the FPS adventure you want, with some great traditional art mixed in, fantastic voice acting and some scares, surprises, and laughs.It will take you around 5+ hours to finish, and a lot more if you read the entire story, which I recommend you do.Some things that aren't immediately obvious:you can scroll the little datapads text by moving your thumb pad.If you're falling, sometimes you can save yourself by using the spacetime manipulator quicklyScrolling the computer screens is done by dragging your finger, just like a cell phone.Challenge: Did you find the carrot? :D"

When it came out, I heard it was buggy so I gave it several months before I purchased, hoping the major bugs would be fixed.Nope.There are way to many game-breaking bugs to call this playable.  The main one has to do with the movement system, which is (very unfortunately) based on the grip buttons.  During in-game events, these buttons are sometimes disabled, and the most prevelant bug is that they get stuck ""on"" or they are completely disabled when enemies appear, both of which usually lead to death.Additionally, very little thought seems to have been put into the boss battles.  The way you beat them is through violent waggling of the Vive, wands, which is tiring and simply not fun.Really unfortunate to see a game with a great demo turn out to be much worse on release.

Something like a mix of Half-Life 1 and Portal but with a more cartoony style, Vertigo has you wandering the halls of a vast abandoned reseach facility after something unpleasant has occured. Using your wits, weapons, and a portal gun thingy that can also slow down time, you have move up through the levels of the facility to make your escape.Vertigo has an awesome art style, largely in bright primary colours but with the occasional tract of oddly 70s looking carpets. It's a game with a definite personality. The controls are great, using the grips to walk forward (hold both to move faster) but also including a very cool teleport device that is something a bit different to the usual point and jump system you see in VR. It's also a game that is constantly throwing new mechanics and set pieces at you, including some great boss battles, and considering the indoors setting it manages some impressively vast environments at times.My only complaints would be it's ever so slightly buggy at the moment, and I've had a couple of crashes that have lost me a bit of progress. A couple of cool mechanics feel a bit under utilised, too. The time slowing mechanic has only been used a couple of times for puzzles in the time I've played. But in general, Vertigo is one of the best designed and most enjoyable games I've played in VR, and for the price I cannot recommend it highly enough. If you've got a Vive, you need this in your collection."

It's a great game and well worth the full asking price. I think this is the first free movement game I played that I would actually fall if I walk out over nothing... and you can't cheat by sticking your head through walls.The only thing I was dissapointed with is the only really challenging part were the first two boss fights and they both happen early on. The game was still a lot of fun at other times but I wish there were a few more sticky situations and more traps. The first demo had  a switch that opened walls around you and left you surrounded by flying bots. Nothing like that happened in the final game. There was only one trap I remember and it was easy. I didn't even get shot at before taking them all out. Also, I would have liked more puzzles.

I saw it the day it'd come out, and bought it the very next day just from seeing small screenshot selection, and the genre. It's a full story, not some techdemo-feeling thingy, but a full, real game.I feel heavy influences from both Half Life 1, and the Portal games, but it's still its own story very much so.The game is quite challanging, and has some boss fights -which I had not yet seen at in in VR games- that were actually tricky, and utilized moving around quite well.Some VR stuff was done really well. Pressing the buttons by literally pressing them, not pressing anything on the controllers, is very nice, though sometimes you press them by accident. Climbing a ladder is nothing special in most games, but in this game, especially during a certain fight, it adds just that little bit extra fun to it, by being the way it is.And though I expected it to get tedious eventually, it didn't really.One major complaint though, there are quite a few gamebreaking bugs. I fell out of the map 2 times, activators that wouldn't activate, button-counts resetting after dying, despite the actual buttons not being reset, stuff like that. Very annoying, and proably wasted up to an hour on replaying certain parts to get past the bugs.Even with that in mind, this game is a very definite 'must-have' for anyone who owns a vive.You will not be disappointed.

I died. I then had to do the boss fight again. I couldn't take this much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and : Rage quit. Anything else before this boss fight has also been super boring and kind of exhausting.

Unfortunately it's a bit buggy for a fully released game.I enjoyed myself with Vertigo. I read that it was one of the better Vive titles that has gone under the radar and I can see why that could be the case. It kind of reminds me a bit of Call of the Starseed in some aspects with some Portal flavor thrown in.The light play from the melee weapon was nicely done. It's still a very novel and interesting mechanic for me to have a torch or some light source that I'm holding over my head while looking around.From my first experience with the game it seems like there's plenty of lore and story to uncover which I like quite a bit. It doesn't seem like you need to sift through this information if it's not your thing but it's nice that it's there. It helps a lot for immersion and just a general feeling of polish and quality IMO.There are locomotion options available. Both Onward style ""trackpad"" locomotion as well as teleport. I say ""trackpad"" with the quotes because you grab the grip button to move forward in the direction your controller is pointing. It essentially is the same feeling but with some subtle differences which for the most part are easy to overcome. Strafing for example would be slightly different.I like that they provide the option for players like me and for the new to VR or prone to motion sickness player. This is the ideal setup to me.The not so pretty...The weird♥♥♥♥♥halo of light that rings my vision at certain points is extremely, EXTREMELY, Annoying. It shows up on the monitor as the four corners of the screen being pure light. I can't fathom any reason for this choice and again, in my opinion, is a very bad experience. I would like to see this ripped out/fixed ASAP.That being said, it's only in the menu and that cutscene as far as I have seen so far so you can get away from it easily enough.Bugz. Really only Bug. Singular. But it was pretty bad. While in the elevator on my way out of the tutorial, the elevator seemed to float off forever. It seemed odd and I started looking at the level below. I was able to see through the ceiling which was probably an oversite by the level designer but the worst part was that I clipped through the floor of the elevator and fell to my death.Once that happened I had no way to complete the tutorial and had to quit to menu.This shadowed the rest of the game as I looked for bugs instead of gameplay elements the next time I got stuck in the elevator. My first thought was the elevator bugged again instead of what actually happened, I was faced with a puzzle to solve.Bottom line.I think the game is worth a look. It still needs some love but overall I enjoyed myself and wanted to keep playing.EDIT: Appending the first boss fight as part of the review.

It has a decent mix of action, exploration and puzzle solving, with a good amount of creative environmental interaction that feels intuitive - climbing up ladders, swinging across pits on pulleys. The action isn't bad - there a only a few enemy types and once you've learnt how to deal with they will never be a problem for the rest of the game. There are also numerous boss fights, which are the highlight of the action. They're for the most part fun to fight and feel like well done set pieces.There are some minor issues, such as some environments being dull to navigate, with huge empty feeling rooms. However where this fell flat for me was the sheer multitude of bugs, some of which require you to close the game. When this happens I've had no choice but to restart from a checkpoint, replaying large sections. I held off on writing a review for this even though I bought the game near when it came out, but as this time of writing many of these bugs still remain.

I had been following the developers news/releases on Youtube and /r/vive ever since the demo and I was basically just letting the hype build over time. Thankfully though, it didn't let the hype get the best of it. I had a fantastic time playing Vertigo and it is in my top 10 best experiences so far. Avoiding plot spoilers, here's my review:Sound and music are great. I love the chiptune style music and the ambience throughout the game is great. Sounds of metal pipes falling and echoing throughout the massive facility, crawling through a cave and hearing the pitter patter of feet, the hum of servers, and so much more all add to a great atmosphere.In the end, the levels and gameplay came together to feel like a Half-Life 1 meets Legend of Zelda game, in VR. Just something about the facility, the enemy types, and the crawling through vents all gave it a HL1 vibe and then the way you get new items, solve puzzles, and the boss fights all gave it a LoZ vibe. Speaking of boss fights, holy crap they are awesome. I wish there were more due to how distinct they are from each other and how they get you to use your gear and weapons.Having said that, my biggest problem that I had with the game was during a boss fight. To describe which one without giving anything away, it would be the one that involves multipl red objects around a spider-like cat thing. The boss itself in terms of gameplay was fine, but one of the attacks that it did caused something really strange with my visuals and it's very hard to put into words. It's as if it stopped or messed with the 3D of my visuals though some stuff was still in 3D and it seemed like part of my left screen was darker than everything else. This actually made me motion sick the first time I fought it, so I turned the game off and then went back in after about an hour. It still happened but I just learned to look away or close my eyes when it happened. Once I got through that, the issues never happened again.Only other bug involved a DNA test and when I put the DNA in the sphere nothing happened forcing me to restart to the last checkpoint. Other than those two things, the game was bug free. It's crazy to think that a game like this, made by only two guys, that never took money through Early Access, and one of the guys is a self-taught designer who learned through reading and watching Youtube videos about Unity and used the Personal edition of Unity for their first game... all that and they made a great, very polished game with very few bugs.

The developers did everything right,.. well almost.  I mean I wish I could pick up the cat and make it eat a burrito,.. The Graphical style is cartoonish,. but kind of like the old 50's style art.  It really gets you into game along with the fantastic immersive sound!  You just really feel like you are there!  I love that you can pretty much pick up and manipulate everything in the game.  The motion system is also one of the best I have experienced in VR.  you can teleport,. in fact,. you must in certain situations, but the straight on movement is really intuitive and for someone like myself that gets motion sick real easy, It just didn't happen here.  You can point with one hand the direction you want to go whilst squeezing the grip buttons, so it leaves you free to look in directions you are not walking and frees up your shooting hand to also shoot in directions you are not walking.  When approaching an area where you want to slow down, simply start tipping your controler up and slow down,. want to go really fast? sqeeze grip buttons on both controlers.  fantastic!The enemies are fun to fight. not very many different types but they all have different attack styles, and the bosses are really fun!  The first one had my arm pretty freaking tired by the time I finally beat it!I love the little touches like the signage throught out the game.  pretty funny stuff.  also things like being able to take your picture at the little info stations.This is a full title.  I have spent a lot of  time playing this game and have gone back for more.  There were many times when I would say out loud, ""no freaking way!"" just because of the fantastic use of VR space.  Zip lines, teleporters ladders.  just a good time all around!""  it even has credits that I want to actually stay and watch and dance too as they fly by!

76561198024066747,Recommended,465430,29402317,Posted: 21 January,all,Wren,"Promising but frustrating.There is a lot to love about this game but it has a number of issues that overall make it difficult to enjoy fully.In the first level, while still getting to grips with the movement mechanics, you're attacked by a flying robot before you have any weapons to defend yourself with. I was killed several times by this same robot before making it to the weapon in the next room so that I could fight back. Not a great introduction.You then go through a fairly long platforming-ish section to get to the elevator at the end of a level. If you die during this section (in one instance I died by glitching through the floor of an elevator) you will meet the next source of frustration: a lack of continue points. Every time you make a minor mistake (or find a bug) that causes your death, you have to play through almost the entire level again. This would be a minor irritation were it not for the plethora of death-inducing bugs.We then reach the first boss fight. The first time you meet the boss, it's terrifying -- this is a genuinely great moment. However, since half the time your sword will go straight through the tentacles you're supposed to fend off, you're gonna watch that unskippable 20 second animation a lot of times. It might have been awesome and dramatic the first time, but it wears thin pretty quickly. This is simple game etiquette -- say NO to unskippable animations.This feels like an early-beta early access game, but there is no indication of this status on the store page.As I said there is a lot to love about this game (the environments, the graphics, the story, the locomotion system) but it is just not ready yet. Hopefully the devs will continue working on this and I will be able to give it the review it deserves.If you are willing to see past these flaws there are some beautiful moments, and the makings of one of the best VR games going right now. It is only on this basis that I would recommend it."

It's like a less frustrating, more imaginative VR version of Fade to Black.This game is a breath of fresh air. A great deal of thought has obviously gone into the concepts used and the fact that these were realised by such a small team makes it all the more impressive.I only have three criticisms:1. I could cheese the boss fights as the damage to the bosses was persistent between loadings.2. The music is great and the sound design is pretty good. One problem is that the background sounds loop over time and over several levels - it doesn't feel as ominous when you know that the footstep sounds and growls are just an audio loop.3. The enemies aren't much of a challenge once you've figured out how to beat them. An energy bar for the shield might help with this (?).If you're not sure about whether to get this, GET IT. At the current price it is an absolute steal."

There were even a few bugs that required me to restart levels entirely as well as a few that just seemed like an easy fix that was ignored. I don't want to tear this game appart because I enjoyed it, but the bugs are my number one complaint.A second problem I had was the lack of story. When there was voice acting, it was really well done, the problem is there was barely any. I just didn't really understand what was happening throughout the game, I guess I got the gist of it, but I was left wishing there was more explained.Now for some positives.Content wise, it's well worth the money! The total playtime was about 5 hours for me (I paid full price), which for a VR game is really good! Level design was a little wonky, but it got the job done and was pretty cool at certain moments. The puzzles were nice, a few were a little bland but well done throughout.I also can't leave out the fear this game gave me. Like, holy cow, there were at least 3 levels that left me trembling and wishing I could grab my blankie. I don't play a lot of horror games, but this game could definitely fall under that category at certain moments. The fear factor was 10/10.Overall, I enjoyed my time with this game, but I wish the bugs wouldn't have messed with my fun. I understand it was your first game so wonky design and things of that nature is forgivable, but a bug fixes are VERY much needed."
76561198077173611,Recommended,465430,35500429,Posted: 5 October,all,Zorrito,"Summary:PROSGenuinely glorious boss battles. (Not revolutionary in terms of technical challenges, but in VR they felt really fresh and involving. Being suddenly 'confronted' with a monster can do that I guess ;))Some grand settings that would please a James Bond villain no end.Lashings of tongue in cheek humourFunctioning physics to keep your hands busy. It's not that they're super functional, or hugely leveraged by the puzzles, but their absence would have hurt the world-building.Little touches like detailed imperfections and staining on glass, or disturbing noises in the distance, make the giant cartoon locations feel more like real places.CONS:Some serious bugs (like not being able to use both hands on ladders, requiring a level reset, or being so blinded by some rogue glare that I couldn't see the puzzle at all, leaving me to prod blindly at space...) break up the flow, and occasionally left lingering doubts as to whether a puzzle is eccentric or  actually broken.Communication is a mixed bag. (PSA: Your teleportation device can also slow down time. This is helpful for some puzzles. Being directly told it would have been helpful too ;))REQUIREMENTS:Roomscale, with full rotation and tracking when hands low down.---Wordy Take:My first complete VR adventure! In flat-game terms it's still not the longest at 7+ hours, nor the most innovative with its 'escape the compromised lab' setting. Where it shines is in the scale and variety of its world, the mischievous details which give it colour, and the titanic punctuations brought about by the boss clashes. The core combat and puzzles just tide you over solidly while you sweat on the next major event. The naturalistic moveset also helped the sensation of actually being there. All round it was a properly enjoyable and involving jaunt :)It sits in a particular sweet spot (for me) in terms of the mix of kinetic action, progression puzzles, and playful narrative-through-location. The 'end of level bosses' werereallywell implemented, often catching me on the hop and using scale and location really effectively. Cowering behind an item and firing at an eye on a stalk has never felt so fun :DCaveats exist though. One is that the main dev was 15 when he started this. This both explains the way its a frothy love letter to a load of gaming archetypes, and also... why it has some really glaring bugs. Like some major major bugs on the Rift. But although they detracted from the experience and the flow at points, they were brief exceptions on balance. I genuinely had so much fun that they couldn't kill the buzz, or knock the overall score down exceedingly. The ending is eccentric, hell, the whole thing is eccentric, but the overall journey was grand :)"
