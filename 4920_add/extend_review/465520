,Recommended,465520,29936064,Posted: 14 February,all,psenough,"nice little puzzle room game. short but with a decent storyline and it's free so why not try it?things that could be improved:- the item system, it should be displaying what object you are currently yielding for action- missing a hint system- text overflows the boxes sometimes"
,Recommended,465520,29401575,Posted: 21 January,all,a(lex)dorable,"THIS is gold.I'm glad that I found out about this game.The story is very interesting, the good point is that there is TWO stories, the bad and good ones. It have some mistery that keeps you in tremor and you always try to figure out what will come next. Since it logical game, the whole game you think. It's not just walking around, but actually putting clues together to find out what's happening.Although it's free, and for free game this is more than just good."
,Recommended,465520,29751409,Posted: 6 February,all,zaiya,"PRICE is a fairly simple point and click mystery game that, despite its length, manages to build up an amazing atmosphere with its artwork, fantastic music, and plot. The storyline consists of two parts: E.C.I.R.P and P.R.I.C.E, each revealing something deeper, and it's executed fantastically.The game is definitely one worth checking out. PRICE went above and beyond my expectations. The soundtrack really was fantastic. The perfect amount of beauty and scary pulled together. I highly reccommend giving it a go. It's free, so what are you waiting for?"

Audio was great, although a little repetitive after a while. Would love to play another game by same creator. Should charge a couple dollars as well, I would gladly pay."

,Recommended,465520,29738178,Posted: 6 February,all,galahadhk,"I knew from the intro and the tarot cards that this game was messed up. Well played China for creating this satanic, illuminati game. Don't be discouraged though, the story it tells has a dire warning; good can come from the bad is the best way I can explain it without spoiling anything. Defenitely worth two playthroughs.You're just going to have to open your EYE to find out the truth."

If you ever get stuck after a cutscene, click through everything again, and it will all be fine."
,Not Recommended,465520,30052501,Posted: 19 February,all,Gamer Shezma,"It is a good game, but i don't recommend it unless you really like point and click games. I don't, i spent a good hour clicking on everything to look on a guide for a code. If your like me and always end up looking up guides for these kind of games stay away. It's generally pretty simple if you are into these kind of games but for me, no."

76561198147893955,Recommended,465520,30151785,Posted: 24 February,all,Derpunari,"Surprisingly creepy - I originally got it because it was free and the artwork seemed nice, although the plot didn't seem to promise much. But it's quite dark without revealing where it's headed too early. The artwork, too, matches the situation, occasionally lightening the mood with chibis before abruptly diving deep again - always the dolls. The dolls are really the main fright, along with the third person I can't give away without spoilers.A small minus for the music, which gets a little annoying after a while, especially when you're trying to concentrate; the game allows you to turn it off, though. And the actual item inventory is explained a bit too curtly, at least I had to look it up in the forum to use it right.The idea to separate item inventory and evidence inventory is really nice, though, and makes a change from the general notebook of Point'n'Click. The riddles are good, too, especially in the first part of the game (with me getting stuck one time because I didn't expect a password to actually be numbers).The ending is plain mean. And gorgeously cynical."
,Recommended,465520,30162647,Posted: 25 February,all,Phoenix,"Intresting story,i reccomend people checking this game out.It's pretty short but as i said it's intresting.Also the ending is quite emotional so that's a plus."
,Recommended,465520,30205274,Posted: 26 February,all,Reinhardt,"One effective way to grasp the player’s interest right off the bat is having an amazing opening to introduce the game's cast and story. That is what exactly what P.R.I.C.E has done.The intro was amazing, beyond that a free game could afford to have included. It had a whole orchestra of effects (blood splatters, flowers and other materials) that flow through a rope of transitions, with many symbolic scenes and notes appearing ever so often. You’re introduced with lines, the cast of characters, and the music made the video all the more amazing. It goes from soft whispering, to the climax of crying where the animations would become heavy and intense. Both elements synced to create a masterpiece.Now getting into the game play, the controls are simple: attempt to find anything that is click-able. It is a Point’N click game after all. Much of the click boxes I found were of decent size, meaning none were so large that I could click on a surface outside of the target object to select, but also not too small so I am unable to select the target area. The cursor also changes to a paw whenever you could interact with something in the game. The objects are pretty scattered however, so you may want to search every point of the room, beyond what needed to be found.The art and fashion is likely based off of the Victorian era (?). Judging by the character costumes as well as the style of furnishings. It’s relatively clean, not too messy or clustered with tones or shading. The latter is what best describes the setting we are in though, due to the lack of light. This aids in creating an eerie environment as well.As for the story itself, it was certainly as grim as how the setting was, and what we’re introduced with from the opening. I had an itching feeling that the story itself was shrouded in mystery. Our character started off in the dark for a reason. This created a nice build to a rather shocking ending. (No spoilers here.)There are also cut scenes, but the English version does not include this feature unfortunately. The translation was decent, though with a few grammar errors here and there.Overall, my experience playing this game was certainly one I enjoyed. I don’t even know if I’ll ever be able to find another free game similar to this one. I would definitely recommend trying this game!"

,Recommended,465520,29659174,Posted: 2 February,all,Oddesu,This is a nice little Point&Click puzzle game with a horror story reminding me of Faust.It is free so why are you still not downloading it right now?
,Recommended,465520,29692596,Posted: 4 February,all,Geese Howard,I really enjoyed this game.  it can be quite difficult figuring out what to do when you get started but it is very satisfying. It is a short game but has a really nice story and you get the feeling of being rewarded with a good ending.  For a free game it does not get much better than this.

,Recommended,465520,29598407,Posted: 30 January,all,Nyte Slayer,"It's a nice little game with beautiful artwork an interesting story.Not to mention cool opening.Though the repetitive in game music and translation errors can be quite annoying, as well as 'equipping' things from the inventory was confusing and took a while to figure out how to use it.You use it by choosing the inventory item, then clicking off the inventory and then choose on an item or object in the room for the item to maybe work.Some of the cutscenes aren't that obvious to let you know what you're supposed to do next, so a I took a few trips down to the walkthrough page.Though some may argue the cons outweigh the pros of the game...It's free and you'll only spend an hour maybe two from your life, so why not when you have nothing better to do with your life.Give it a go."
,Recommended,465520,29634479,Posted: 1 February,all,Sheep!,"This is a very good game, which I heartily recommend, and yet I can see why it's being given away for free.  The actual gameplay is driven with a very simple point-and-click adventuring engine, with a somewhat clumsy inventory system, though it's adequate for the purpose.  The real shining star here is story, the nature of which is such that any spoilers would detract terribly, so I won't discuss it.  The game is also quite short, and, like most single-path story-driven adventures, has no replayability at all.  Despite the intensity of the story, it would be hard to justify much of a price tag.All that being said,play it!It asks only about an hour of your time, and is so very, very worth it."

76561198091782667,Recommended,465520,29729524,Posted: 5 February,all,🅵🅰🅶🅶🅾🆃,"Nice and short little point and click, artwork are awesome in some areas and lacking in others, The ui and menu are somewhat unfitting and pop out a bit too much, And the animation could be better, since the background scene is animated at a different rate, lets say on 1's while the character is animated on 2's the result is a jarring motion which could be fixed by adding those extra char frames. The plot was interesting and refreshing. Overall, awesome little indie game just lacks some polish."

76561198156334296,Recommended,465520,29708325,Posted: 4 February,all,Food + Stomach = Happiness,"P.R.I.C.E is an incredible game where the visuals, sounds/music and story keeps you on edge. As you progress in the story, you discover the terrifying truths with every new clues and items sending chills down your spine (at least it did to me).Adding to this are the sounds and music which doesn't calm you down at all. But watch out, you have to listen extra-carefully and I do mean extra-carefully if you want to avoid clicking evrything on the screen for several hours (it happened to me on the first part). All in all, P.R.I.C.E is an excellent psychologic horror game, definitely worth a try, and I would consider it as a gem.I wish for more games like this one from YETU GAME."

This is a point an click game and at some points I got stuvk so I had to use a guide for help.I loved the music even though it can get annoying when u are investigating the rooms. I loved the art in the game, the translation is also not the best but not the worst either.U actually unlock the achievements by finishing the game. I was like how do u unlock the achievements since they didn't pop up in game. After I excited the game the achievements just unlocked. So the achievements are easy to get:)Damn man the story made me sad:(Definetly this game is worth a playthrough as I enjoyed the game."

It's not that hard to play it through but it gives you some time to spend in a bit of mystery (and for some maybe quiet horror-kind) of atmosphere.I liked it. And it's free. So give it a try if you have 1hour, probably even less, in between to play something with a little story."
