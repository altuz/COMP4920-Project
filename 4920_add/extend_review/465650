Admittedly, as I know so little about baseball, I have the computer AI make all the gameday decisions (tactics and substitutions) and I just do the squad building side of things, but it is still engaging nonetheless. The game has even prompted me to watch a bit of baseball.I can only imagine how much better this game would be if I was a baseball fan and knew what I was doing. So if you are, and sports management games are your thing, this is a definite buy.I have one criticism: the game needs tooltips (or at least the option of for newbies) which spell out what the acronyms for the various statistics stand for e.g. ERA - Earned Run Average. This is a major issue for the game's accessibility."
76561197962445048,Recommended,465650,32844669,Posted: 26 June,all,Brentmeister General,"Background: I've played OOTP since 2013, and have bought every game since.Pros:+ Fully licensed with names, logos and authentic ball parks in 3D mode+ VERY deep and realistic player development engine. Will your 1st rounder pan out, or be a bust? Track their performances through your farm system and promote/demote them at the right time! Or hire an assistant GM and let him take care of the kids, while you focus on the big league side of things.+ 40-round draft. Your scout will help you rate the prospects on a 10-grade scale (ranging from 0,5 stars to 5 stars), but there's a lot more to it. Taking your time in the late rounds to filter out the best of the ""non-prospects"" can really pay off!+ International Complex with up to 50 players, and an authentic International Amateur Free Agency every summer.+ HIGHLY customizable game. I play mine ""vanilla"", standard game, standard settings except small adjustments to the AI to make it a bit harder. But it's possible to change basically everything. You can even create your own baseball world, with your rules! (even promotion/demotion!)+ League evolution (can be turned off with a checkbox): MLB constantly changes, and so does it in the game! The league can expand, change rules to active/secondary roster, change DL times, lower or raise the mound, increase or decrease years that teams control players. In my last OOTP17 game, the league decreased team control down to the minimum, making players arbitration eligible after their first season, and possibility of unrestricted free agency after only 4 seasons. It created a very interesting challenge.+ Authentic rules regarding everything (that I can think of at least). Arbitration, Rule 5, Waivers, Free Agency - it's all in there!+ Quick simming: You can play a season in half an hour, or you can play a season in 80 hours managing every at-bat. All up to you!Can't say much about:? Trading. I've heard the trade engine has gotten better and better (it's tough to program an AI to evaluate trades as well as a human would). I restrict myself to only use the ""Shop around"" feature, which basically asks the teams of the league what they´re willing to give me for a certain player (always 1:1 trades) with Very Hard trading difficulty, and AI Heavily Favor Prospects. If you really wanted to, I'm assuming it's possible to abuse the trade engine to create a monster team though. But just do what I do! Don't! ;)? In game managing. I've always played as GM only, and let my manager take care of the games. From what I've seen though, it's possible to call for just about anything as the manager. Hit&Run, Steal, Bunt, Take Pitch, Pitch Around, IBB - it's all there. You can even call for your pitcher to hit the batter.Cons:- 3D Engine.  The 3D engine is fairly new, and has definitely been improved since it was first launched. But it definitely has flaws. The graphics are sort of like Football Managers first 3D engine, and some plays just look weird. I had a guy hit a laser line draw into the left field wall, that bounced all the way back to the shortstop for a 6-3 Groundout.If you're going to use the 3D engine, please understand that it's just a cosmetic representation of the play, and may NOT  actually be what happened. The above AB's outcome was a standard groundout to short, but the 3D engine picked a stupid way to represent that. So the 3D engine doesn't break your games in any way, it's just ""a skin"" on an already decided outcome.I kind of enjoy the 3D engines flaws, as you at least get a good laugh out of it every now and then. But if you don't like wonky plays, stick to the text play-by-play.- It's brutally realistic, and thus can be tough for newcomers to either the franchise, or just baseball in general. I'm swedish, with a long background from other sports management games (mainly Championship Manager and later Football Manager) and had a very rough few first hours back when I was new to baseball. I'm very happy I stayed in the game and learned, as it's very rewarding, very addicting, and baseball a truly amazing sport.If you're new to the game and/or the sport, I would encourage you to go toootpdevelopments.com/boardorreddit.com/r/ootpto read some guides.It is possible to learn everything about baseball while playing OOTP, but be prepared to spend some time on Google.Overall: Best sports franchise game on the market. Highly addicting, realistic to the extreme, and so, very, very rewarding. I promise you - you won't regret buying this game if you're into sports management games."

It's amazing.Here's why:I picked up a team and decided to trade one of my guys.  I got two players in return - one comparable and one random minor-leaguer.  The minor league guy i put in AA.  He quickly went to AAA - but his ""ratings/potential"" (not stats but how a scout would view his worth from 20-80 scale) never really moved.  His batting was ok but he was a great defensive player so he had that going for him.  They were ok but that was all.  Then one of my MLB outfielders went on the DL.  I needed to call up a AAA guy.  I had 2 that had already been there but just didn't do well.I had a feeling to just give this guy a shot, especially because my MLB player that had the job before the DL was a decent batter but sucked in the field.  I figured at least anything hit to him would be an out.Well that happened and more.  This guy started to hit.  But not out of the world type hitting.  His average is currently around .290 (good but not spectacular) BUT he drives in runs like nobody's business.  In critical situations with RISP the guy is just clutch.  Nearly every time.  I guess my scout has a blind spot and it may be time to look for another scout!Anyway - just one of the storylines happening.Great game..."

,Recommended,465650,31636910,Posted: 8 May,all,Dr. Strangelove,"SummaryThis is quite likely the best manager sim I have ever played. It is very deep, with a lot of different statistics and tables that allow you to see every little detail of every player and every team, psychological model with distinct personalities that can have very different impact on your chemistry, yet very adjustable, and you can delegate simply everything to the AI which is more than capable. But what really sets this game apart from virtually every other one is ability to play every single team from 1870s, with real players, real stats, and real rules. There is a huge difference between a team from the 19th century, the deadball era, and today. Each period has its own rules, and each will play very differently.To sum up - this game should be the example for Sports Interactive. Make your Football Manager like this, and I might even consider buying it again.What works1. The deep system of statistics and personalities that make every player unique.2. Team chemistry which makes your players interact and work together, with results based on their personality. Some people are nice and make it fun, some will disrupt your team, and a few ones are great leaders who can make a huge difference. Choose wisely.3. Customizability - you can customize everything in this game - easily create your own leagues, stadiums, players, personnel, rules, and edit whole countries, without the need to buy in-game editor or some other *** as in Football Manager. Commissioner mode gives you a lot of power, and you are really in charge. Want to create your own award? Done. Add your player to the Basseball Hall of Fame. Done. Create a third Major League? No problem.4. Really good AI that is quite capable and fallible like a human.5. Game seems very realistic. Outcomes of games are believable and baseball is as unpredictable as in real life.6. Your club's owner has his own personality, goals, and a different vision. Act accordingly or else... you're fired.7. There are literally thousands of clubs to choose from, including many historical ones. You can play Major League team or a minor one - your call.8. The game is very stable, but also offers you a backup feature, so you won't lose your precious database after several decades of playing.9. It's baseball so you will literally play almost every day which means even more fun in one season than in soccer.10. Other modes are also fun - you can for example play as New York Yankees from the times of Lou Gehring and Joe DiMaggio against 2017 Boston Red Sox or 1960 Milwaukee Braves. You can even play with real players from any period playing together. Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Mike Piazza and Sandy Koufax in one team? No problem.11. Face-gen system is amazing and customizable. You can for example choose how many percent of your players will have beards and then how popular each of the beard styles will be, with dozens of them. You can even make them black-white or sepia to be compatible with your era. It's probably the best system in any manager game.12. Developers are real baseball afficionados and made everything work wonderfully great - if you will it, it is no dream.13. Despite hundreds of teams the game runs pretty fast for me.What doesn't work?1. There are still some minor bugs, especially with minor leagues in the 1920s, but those are beint patched quite efficiently and developer support is good.2. Game could definitely use some built-in real pictures and 3D models of stadiums (at least major ones) - bur then again, you can find them on the internet and on Steam Workshop."

That said, if you really like the idea of being able to compete with others via the Challenge mode, or if you've always wanted to sim the Negro Leagues, grab it.If, however you've not played this but are thinking about it. Or, if you've not gotten a new version in a couple of years, seriously, don't wait. Grab this now! It's one of the deepest and most challenging strategy games on Steam, and it does this while still capturing the highs and lows of the emotional roller coaster that is a Major League Baseball season."

Small things, big things, everything comes together to create the greatest simulation game of all time. Not just baseball simulation either. I've never played a sim with such attention to detail, the kind that shows the developers do this out of a love for baseball and management. When I was growing up, listening to my Dad tell stories about Hank Aaron and Jackie Robinson and all those other iconic players are some of my fondest memories. Playing this game is like being 12 years old again sitting next to my dad during the 7th inning stretch. Everything just makes sense, and for a moment the only thing in the world is baseball. And that's a beautiful thing."
76561198088171607,Recommended,465650,30708180,Posted: 24 March,all,Boris,"Having grown up on MicroLeague Baseball in the mid-to-late 80's, I was always waiting for the next ""pure"" baseball sim to come along that would rival the managerial joy of that first classic. The 90's and 2000's were filled with some great baseball games, but they were dependent upon you being able to hit ""X"" at the right time.  OOTP's early offerings were the first in decades to take the MicroLeague Baseball approach, giving you full control over both existing historical teams and leagues as well as the creation of your own fantasy teams and leagues from any era.  Better yet, they're completely stat driven, with the most ""in game"" influence (if you want) being your job as manager.OOTP 18 has taken the baseball sim to incredible heights.  They've built upon a core that was already strong and have refined the interface without making it unfamiliar.  Earlier versions had some quirks but they've done a great job of streamlining things in '18.  I especially love the option for animations, as this really brings back great memories of the original MicroLeague Baseball.  While I doubt we'll be able to predict an inside-the-park home run by watching how fast the batter comes out of the box, where the ball is headed, and how fast different fielders are moving to their positions (a MicroLeague classic), the animations should be a nice touch.TL;DR ... After 30 years I am finally ready to admit that MicroLeague Baseball is the 2nd best baseball simulator ever.Buy this game.101/10(102/10 if I can make a team of only Samoan-born players)"

,Recommended,465650,34953059,Posted: 14 September,all,MASTASMASH,"OOTP Baseball 18 - A Game With PromiseFirst off I would like to commend Out Of The Park Developments on a great and addicting game, there are not many MLB Liscensed titles out there and the few that do exist today are either exclusive or don't live up to expectations, in my personal opinion.The Bad:There really isn't anything hugely bad about this game for me to critique, the game has it's obvious faults but those faults were not advertised in order to make a profit, the game is what it claims to be.The Good:Historical Simulation at it's finest, This game lets you go all the way back to the late 19th century and take over your favorite MLB Teams to rewrite history or to create your own teams and leagues.Franchise Mode is honestly the best thing here, my personal favorite thing to do is create my towns team as a professional independent and create a dynasty, which is much more challenging than I make it out to be.Game Balance is pretty good, nothing is too hard or too easy, the game has a ton of things to micromanage, however you can always diliberate that to your AI Manager to help you out. I reccomend taking the game slowly at first by using an MLB team to learn the basic principles of how the game works.The Potential:Currently this game has 3D stadiums for all the current MLB franchises, and the modding community here has some they have created too. The Dynamic Crowd is a great idea and I feel like if the developers took a little more time with the next game we could potentially move away from the low poly crowd and pawn characters in the actual games. The models and animations don't even need to be that good, I just think that if they existed the game would be that much better.Final Score:85/100Give it a shot.This game is promising and a great buy for baseball and managment simulation fans, curve your expectations, this isn't MLB The Show, this is something that has much more depth, strategy, and customization. So why an 85? Games are not perfect, and this one is no exception, there isn't much to complain about, just some missed opprotunities."
76561198007833990,Recommended,465650,31880083,Posted: 21 May,all,bruinb77,"OOTP18 is the latest version of a great baseball simulator.  I noticed two significant changes from OOTP16 (last version that I owned).  First, the 3D view of the game.  Pervious versions that I played was basically text-only with minimal graphical reflections of the action.  This addition is a very nice touch and aligns with the play-by-play text that is presented.  Since I tend to play all the games (not sim), I have enjoyed this feature much  more than I would have thought.  Another little nuance that I thought was great is after a completed game, there is a nice recap of the game along with player ""quotes"" and a probability of winning line as the game progressed.  The other significant change that I found is the new ""challenge mode.""  Although this does not fundamentally change the game, you can now compare your results to the other OOTP18 players out there.  Challenge mode restricts a couple things in the game (e.g. player editor, long-term simulation), but does enable your score to be recorded against other players.  These two changes were worth getting OOTP18.For those that are unfamiliar with the series, OOTP18 is a baseball game for all of the armchair GMs and Managers that are out there.  This is the third iteration that I have played (OOTP16 and OOTP10) and the game continues to evolve very well.  As with the pervious couple of versions, OOTP has the MLB and Player's Association license.  As a sports fan, you always wonder about how you would remake your favorite team into a dynasty and now is your chance.  You start with the ability to manage a MLB team today or any year from 1871.  You may also choose one of several International Leagues that are available.  From day one, you can delegate authority to the AI or control everything.  From the GM perspective, this includes player and staff contracts, free agent signings, major/minor league roster moves, drafts, trades, and organizational budget allocations.  From the manager perspective, you set your pitching rotations and lineups.  At that point, you can dive into playing each baseball game or sim through the days.  All the statistics from MLB history is available and its fun starting from scratch in 1871 to learn about the early pioneers in baseball.  The other great thing about the OOTP series is the ability to create your own fictional leagues, uniforms, and designs with the large user-mod community.The bottom line is that this game is a must have for people who love baseball."

Great job,dev staff! Even the crowd movements, while somewhat rudimentary, are a nice improvement over OOTP17. Additionally, in 3D mode, the player sprites are a decent improvement over the chesspiece-like sprites in OOTP17.My only ""con"" would be that,after a few hundred managed games with OOTP17, and now a dozen or so in OOTP18...still NO FOUL OUTS ever! I think this is wierd and supposedly the staff is looking into this. That's IT. That's my only ""con.""-The MOD folks do a great job modding the 3D stadium advertising, the player facegens and adding player photos,etc. So what the game doesn't have (and frankly the player facegens are pretty darn good), you can easily download!-Here's THE BIGGEST ""PRO"" for me, a long-time baseball PC-simmer: where ELSE can you get EVERY HISTORICAL SEASON EVER PLAYED...included in the game?Look, I LOVE APBA; I still do; along with APBA Baseball for WIndwos v 5.75, and still visit that game from time to time. I always will; it's been a part of my life for 40 years. But having to purchase each season seperately and not having a 3D option is their biggest drawback. THIS game, OOTP, has every season, current or past, all the current ballparks, and if I want past ballparks I just have to d-load them from a MOD site.And did I mention you can manage, GM, or just watch games with current majors AND minors, with real rosters? Manage a game overseas...yours for the taking. Even weather patterns.NOTHING is left out.---The learning curve in OOTP admittedly is slightly steep, but not much. It's only because there are SO many options.If you haven't purchased OOTP ever, for goodness' sake BUY THIS NOW if you're a baseball sim lover like me. And as mentioned I bought OOTP this year and the updates are worth it. Especially through Steam so the updates are automatically done.You will NOT be sorry. And you won't be able to stop playing.

I never played historical games until OOTP 18 and the results are almost spot on to actual historical results when you use historical transactions. Pretty cool.My main gripe is the same as it's always been with the OOTP series and that's the trade logic. I know this is an area that's very difficult to get right. It's been greatly improved and this version is the best yet but there are still some annoyances. For instance, I like the feature that allows me to let the other teams know that I have a need for power hitting LF. I'll get emails from other GMs willing to make a trade offering to fill my need. But at the trade menu when I attempt to trade for the player, the response I get is ""You have no players who could make this deal work"".

Also, I haven't yet had a problem with over-talented players. OOTP 17 had problems where players would consistently be in the 60's, 70's, and 80's, yet I haven't run into this problem in 18.If you haven't played 17, be aware that you don't play baseball in these games - rather, you are the General Manager. You are the head of the franchise, and you decide the ultimate path that your team goes down.There are small issues - such as player contracts. I know that it displays the, ""Player contracts are not current"" screen at the beginning, but playing as the Nationals, for example, those contracts can be an absolute pain. Strasburg gets paid 15 million per year, then gets bumped to 45 million for a year, then back down to 15 million, then back upto 35 million, rather than 25 million flat. This is fine for normal mode, but challenge mode really turns into challenge mode with that contract.10/10 overall rating. If you want a sports simulator, this is your best option."

It could use some default settings when you select this type of league regarding league levels, finances, minors, drafts, and so on. But I'm not mad about that. Promotion/Relegation is harder than it sounds, and I wasn't expecting it to be simple right off the bat.The problem is that OOTP18 at this point crashes fairly often.

Secondly this game is a stat head's dream come true, this game possesses every stat in baseball, (Some of which I wasn't aware of), if you are a fan of number's and want to try and recreate Moneyball you can give it your best try. I also enjoy how well the UI works, it is a simple and easy interface that once you get the hang of using it, it makes setting up roster or checking finances a breeze, this is a little off-topic but if the Hockey Iteration of this game could have a simple UI like this it would make the game way more playable than it is now. For people who are on the fence about this game I will tell you that it doesn't have the best graphic's (If you are looking for graphics just go play The Show), It can seem like a lot to take in for a first time player to the series, and last but not least if you like being a General Manager or a Manager of a baseball team or just an overall intrest on how difficult it is to run a ball club this game is for you. 10/10"

Semi-frequent updates to the game reflect real-world rosters and player abilities, and every facet of the game is very well thought out to simulate real-life results, daring you to make conservative decisions for marginal team improvement, or risky moves which could result in acquiring a superstar or a lemon.The best part about the game, however, is how totally customizeable it is. Whether you want barely any involvement in managing a team in a single league, or want total control over every single facet of your team's franchise (pitch count for your rookie league starter, or how often your 3rd string right fielder starts against Left Hander's when there's a DH), the game can be absolutely adapted to fit your current appetite.This is bar none the only baseball game that has satisfied my PC baseball appetite in the last 12 years (and I've been looking pretty hard), and I'm already thinking that OOTP baseball 2019 will be worth my money money as well."

Add in nonsense of slow baserunniners taking extra bases CONSTANTLY....

You can have HOF caliber fielders not gunning down the slowest baserunners in MLB history taking extra bases..... just really disappointing.If they maybe add a mechanic, or make it so outfielders actually try to gun down baserunners more, I can genuinely give this full endorsement.

They've touched up the cosmetics of it, but the workings are still complete mashugana. I just don't think that for the 40 bucks each and every year, this game is worth it for me anymore. The rosters/players/etc could just be sold as DLC (as could the 3D stadiums, etc)  or (GASP) just updated by modders for free at this point. So if you want me to buy 19, make it worth my while (and I really want you to - my childhood was filled with Microleague leagues with friends and brothers) OR go the way of Paradox with an endless stream of DLC rather than going the way of EA with minor tweaks and updates for mega bucks. I've had enough. Really.Best of luck to you guys."

I recommend THAT game.In OOTP 18 they messed up the way the screen size auto-adjusts at first launch, so you have to do it manually. That would be no problem but when you do it manually it messes up the FaceGen (because you surely want to play on full 1920x1080 but that option makes the screen resize--as it should--and when it does it messes up FaceGen). The devs keep telling people it's them, but it's not ""them"", ""you"", or ""me"". It's the devs. They messed up and they don't know where.I went to Google and I fiddled with the initial game setting options regarding FaceGen and that sort of worked. So now my team has pictures yet new pictures that are made appear in the profile page but don't appear on ""hover over"" anywhere else unless you have sex with them, or so it feels like it, I suppose I could just ask it to make ALL pictures and be done with it but I see no need to have Minor League pictures and I'm not into fixing their problems. This part worked just fine in OOTP 17.The old problem of a custom made character's fielding stats (all of them) abruptly changing from 250 to 200 is still present (even at change set to 1). You have to check your custom made character every in-game month and then save outside the save location (you need a backup you can throw into the current save game location just in case it borks up on you). This is in Commisioner Mode and you should play that way if you want to fix odd things that WILL happen. You should also auto-save every month.If you don't care about FaceGen or the 3D (which is really poorly implemented--they could do the 3D better in 1986) then the game is okay. But this game IS about the FaceGen AND the 3D so just buy OOTP 17. The FaceGen is actually better in OOTP 17. It works as intended. You don't need what the devs call 3D.OOTP 18 is just a slightly modified verion of OOTP 17 and made only for profit while the devs tackle the problem of how to make 3D more than just matchsticks moving around the field. And those matchsticks sometimes make catches while the voice says ""it drops in for a hit"". The Devs have always been good and ""on top of things"" but they bit off a bit more than they could chew here. They still try to help though. I give them credit for that. I suggest they actually buy the game on Steam on a high end PC, install with Steam and see what happens.I have both games. OOTP 17 is the MUCH better game (unless you don't care about FaceGen). But the FaceGen is still better in OOTP 17.Note: Given the amount of positive reviews it's possible that some or even most people will have 0 problems with OOTP 18. And yes, I did reinstall, restart, and ran Steam in Admin mode and had sex with the FaceGen settings. And yes, the game itself works just as well as OOTP 17 but my FaceGen is a bit off, which is not the end of the world. By all means buy this game if you wish to support the Devs. It's just that OOTP 17 works the same and FaceGen works as intended. It just doesn't have the matchsticks running around pretending to be baseball players."

Fun, strategic, and incredibly deep, OOTP 18 is a step above all previous entries in the series.But that doesn't mean there aren't misteps.A major one is how there is still no major tutorial mode. While at first this game seems like a ""Point and Click simulator"" the reality is that this is a deep and complex series of menus, some of which are incredibly cluttered and hard to understand without expirementing or prior knowledge. If there was an optional mode or at least a ""How to play"" menu, I think it would reduce the pain of newer players settling in.Challenge mode is new to OOTP 18, and it is awesome. Removing any chances of cheating, making you use all your knowledge of the game to build up a championchip contender. However, with this mode, some things are made heavily abundant. The major one being that TRADE A.I. IS HOT GARBAGE. In challenge mode, the A.I. is set to the hardest settings, which is natural, given the name. However, what results is a trade market heavily dominated by weaker players, with those players being offered for your best. (I.E. Boston Trading Babe to the Yankees for prospects) It's silly, and made worse by the fact that you can't pull that back on them. Want to run a Braves franchice? Good luck with the heavy contracts of Bartolo Colon, Nick Markaksis, R.A. Dickey, and Matt Kemp, which take up over half the total payroll, and are at maximum, 3 STARS OUT OF FIVE! That is bullcrap.Besides those misteps though? Everything else is excellent. 3D mode is improved to feature small little animations to represent players doing things, and even minor quality of life things like celebrations of walk off hits have been added. It's nice to see the devs putting in the extra effort. Most everything else is either kept from past versions, or slightly updated, but I'm not a huge technical guy. I'll leave it at these Devs clearly love the game of baseball and the fans, so I highly reccomend OOTP Baseball 18 to any fan of the game, or even the occasional statistician."

Honeslty, I'm trying to get me old FB league to move to this.  The game is so deep and there is so much to do.  You can do it all or you can hire people and assign them tasks to take over.  I started with a fictional league based on the teams that existed (but not the players) and league structure from when Ken Griffey Jr. Presents MLB was made for the SNES.  That was the first great baseball game I ever played.  I kept the structure with no wild card, but my league my eventually adopt one.  I wanted the Pirate's GM job at first, being from PGH but it wasn't available.  So I took over the White Sox and held a league inagural draft.  I did pretty well and within 5 seasons I won the Series.  I immediately (and I mean before the parade), jumped ship to Pittsburgh, who coincidentially I had just beaten for the crown.One of the best parts is that I find myself following both teams,  After the move I wondered if I had sold out the CWS for my one ring before I went to the team I wanted to really make great.  Turns out I didn't even make the playoffs in PGH but the CWS went back-to-back WS champs.  I felt a sense of accomplishment for that though only the shadow of my influence was left there.  Regardless, I was rooting for them.  I also find myself rooting for players, be they guys I took a flyer on or guys I had to let go.  Following careers and debating HOF qualifications in my head for this league has been an absolute blast.In my opinion, the game is better than just a spreadsheet manager type game.

I think to make this review different and add something worthwhile I'll compare it very briefly to Football Manager.Wheras in FM the main gets more complex every year, adding aspects to the role of a manager that no real life manager would ever deal with.For instance a Premiership manager who deals with what a right back in his under 19 squad does in training on a Wednesday afternoon  - to the point they have had to create a second game (3 really) with ""Touch"" and ""Handheld"" being lighter and probably more realistic analogies of what a manager - a single person in the organisation - actually does.OOTP adds depth but NOT complexity. The game has for many years been split in two Manager and General Manager with the option to do both if you want, but never to confuse the roles in the way FM seems to confuse manager and coach (and trainer and physio and marketing director and media manager and boot boy and....). The amount of micro managing in OOTP is still pretty high, (though this can be varied with game options) but it's also pretty consistent. It's the game engine that adds the depth - not just piling on more responsibilities onto one man in the way FM does.The problem is the way FM feels when you lose and you HAVEN'T micromanaged down to the Nth degree. Like ""I could have dug deeper and done something to prevent that) - and in that way madness lies. I've played a 6 hour session of FM before now and in that time the club played 9 games.  Then you get sick of the time it's taking -  turn on all the auto options, the club loses 4 out of 5 games and you think ""I'd better go back to spending almost an hour prep on each game doing stuff that no RL manager would ever even consider doing - just to prevent that happening again"". For me that's when FM feels a lot more like a crazy time management job than a game. I tinker with aspects and sit there thinking ""Who in the hell does all of this IRL?""In OOTP I never feel like that. My remit is clearImportantlyin OOTP your success as a GM or M are based on your performance in that specific role. You can be a great manager getting the best out of a poor club or some poor decisions made by the GM - and vice versa. The game acknowledges your own success in your own specific role without making you think you need to jump a fence and take on extra ""plate spinning"" responsibilities and do the work other members of your organisation should be doing. FM will be adding ""Emmersive boot shining and shirt ironing"" responsibilities for premiership managers next - just to add depth to the game... no thanks. That's not what a manager does - that's what a game developer does when he thinks they HAVE TO add more ""STUFF"" every yearSorry I think I've made the point :)Simming?--------------Simming - Almost every OOTP player sims by week or month or even by season. Perhaps playing ""inning by inning"" or"" at bat by at bat"" just in key games here and there. Baseball is about long lasting trends of players. A rookie might take 2 seasons to develop - and needs playing time at the appropriate level to do so. Your owner might set you a goal to win the division or pennant in 4 years and expect you to do pretty poorly as""rebuild years"" are a real thing in Baseball that are accepted by almost everyone - even the fans. It's a very different sort of game though back in 2006 they looked pretty similarIf you love Baseball this is THE management game management version of the game - with  MLB The Show (sadly only on PS4) being the arcade version. If you love text based sims (spreadsheet sims) then this rivals or beats FM but actually plays quite differentlyOf course I recommend it. A fantastic game that, if you love text sports sims and/or baseball will swallow hundreds of hours and you'll enjoy almost every second of it."

First the good, I love the improvement in the 3d mode, the game flow is exciting,fast pased , full of action and it's really cool hearing the crack of the bat so crisp and the crowd upgrade is the best I've heard in any sim I've played the crowd seems really connected to the game and not just a lame yay loop that most games put in. The game flow is great, the Stats as usual great, The tounament mode although i am very happy to see it needs work. At first I did not understand that you have to create a league before you can have a touney? WHy? I don't see why you just can't hit the Tournament button and add your teams select what format you want and go. Why so complicated? Also, why no double loss elimination? That is a classic tournament mode and should be in there for folks that like a short tourney. Also, I bought the game on steam so I could get the discount plus the Hockey manager and it did not connect to my OOTP 17 ? How can I get them connected? 17 has real pictures and team colors already together , On 18 I have to start all over! Another problem I'm having is where are the add ons? on the OOTP 17 page the add on link is right on the home page !  Making it nice and easy to DL the latest pics ,ballparks etc. On OOTP 18 I can't find it. The thing that I do not like at all is fictional players and roster changes without my permission. on 18 even though I hit the allow no AI changes button and I control all teams button players were lost aand or ficitonal players added. That has to be fixed. I know your probably working on fixes so I will be patient but, these things need to be done. But great job on the smooth and exciting game flow."

The historical drafts are broken.I'll repeat that.THE HISTORICAL DRAFTS ARE BROKENSo much for playing baseball history.UPDATE 7/27/17:So I figured out why it wasn't working.  If you select historical minor leagues it keeps the draft pool blank.  I am assuming it automatically dumps the historical rookies into the minor league systems that orig. drafted them as you progress year by year.  I was under the impression it would populate the historical minor leagues STARTING at your game start date and let you draft from there.

I untick the trade alert messages because it is just spam.- Lower scout accuracy in challenge mode, I think normal accuracy makes it too easy to pick better players than the AI. Even the low settings seem a bit too accurate. The low settings seem to overrate players, but those players are still close to their predicted ratings.- More intelligent AI draft choices, as a successful team consisently going deep in the playoffs I was able to keep my minor league system top tier through the drafts. This was over a 30 year span, I was hoping to face a little more adversity or need to make moves to bolster my minor league teams. My top choices were consistently left on the board in the rule 5 draft and first year draft.I will say though, during the international amatuer signing period, the AI does a good job recruiting the better recuits in this class, I think it is because the draft pool is limited.As it stands the game is still the best sports game on PC, with a few AI tweaks and improvements OOTP 19 will build upon an already incredible franchise.OH and one more thing, in the 3d mode it should show which pitch the pitcher threw + velocity instead of just the velocity."

I am a baseball fan, which is obvious, but I've always liked baseball games that were more interactive, e.g., MLB 17 The Show, etc.  If that's solely the kind of baseball game you want, don't buy this game; if you like a regular baseball game and also like the behind the scenes nuances of baseball, like putting a team together, managing free agents, running a draft, and analyzing WAR and BABIP figures, then you should strongly consider buying this game.  The interface does take some time to adapt to, but once you do, you'll already be hooked on the game.  The game presents multiple challenges to overcome, on either the manager or general manager track, and there is nothing quite like putting a team together in the winter and watching it evolve over the season.  You have to manage injuries, slow starts, rising minor league stars, and aging veterans; you have to keep your attendance figures up and your fans happs as you spar with miserly owners, micromanaging GMs, and the public at large.  You do all of these during the course of the full season, and you watch with agony as you go through each game, getting closer and closer to September and (hopefully) October.  While the game's large database does often take too long to load, it remains the sole criticism I have for the game overall.
