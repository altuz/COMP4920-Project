,Recommended,465760,22871546,"Posted: 8 May, 2016",all,Spammals,"Scrap Garden is a very charming game with a very lovable lead character. A robot which otherwise wouldnt have amounted to much in this robot world finds himself as the last hope of saving all life across the world!There's 2 things about this game that i feel sums everything up without going into to much detail.1# It's not a hard game, but thats okay because that's not what it's about. It does have puzzling moments along the way that are entertaining and i did find myself getting killed a few times by trying to rush a boss encounter.2# What mate this game for me was the tone and it's pace. It feels like im being read a bed time story leaving me unable ot sleep until i find out if the hero Canny wins. As each world passes my love for Canny grew and grew. He doesnt have a lot to say ""Beep boop"" but you can tell the kindness in his heart is pure, and that we all could learn a little from him.I clock this game at about 2hours if you're not rushing and I'm more than happy having paid for it.In the name of being critical, it wouldnt be fair for me to praise the game so much without saying something critical, but in the hope it could be taken helpful.If i could suggest a couple things, It would be a more diverse sellection of animals / monsters. And coupled with that, i'd like to see them become more of a threat as with how it currently is, they're just 1 boop on the head away from the graveyard regardless of what they are.Great game, have a very humble time. Would recommend to a friend.7/10. :)"

It's short, it's not too challenging, and it has a nice storyline.First, some drawbacks (for me personally):-  I must say the voice acting was a bit iffy -- but it was also entertaining to listen to (perhaps unintentionally). The English grammar was also a bit odd at times, but I imagine that wouldn't bother most people.- The storyline lost me sometimes, though I don't know if that's because of an issue with the way it was written, with a hazy storyline in general, or my own inattentiveness.- The puzzles weren't very challenging, so I would've liked a bit more in that regard (but this level of difficulty would probably be great for kids).- The controls using a mouse and keyboard were a tad frustrating at times but not impossible.- I felt like there was little incentive to collect more red crystals than required, and it was a bit disappointing to see all the crystals I collected get used up in each level even when I had more than necessary. Maybe there is an incentive to collect more that I'm just not aware of.Things I liked:- It felt really personal. This is why I like indie games. They give you a glimpse into the creators' minds and imaginations, and that really came across in this game. It certainly has a unique feeling to it, despite being (I imagine) inspired by a variety of similar kid-friendly puzzle games.- The music is really nice and pleasant to listen to; it added to the overall feeling of the game as relaxing and sort of magical in a melancholic way.- The game world is pretty to look at.- Canny is quite adorable and I really liked its R2-D2-esque way of communicating.- There are moments of odd and unexpected humour in the game that made me laugh out loud. It's an inoffensive and slightly absurd humour that perhaps appeals most to the young at heart.- The game felt a bit old school in some ways. It reminded me of when I used to play games as a kid in the 1990s. I'm not sure how to articulate what specifically about the game made it come across that way, but it was both nostalgic and refreshing.Anyway, it's a pretty nice game, and I'm glad I played it. If you think you appreciate similar things to me in an indie game, go ahead and try it out!"

Thankfully most of the annoyances I had with the demo aren't in the full game. So...yay!Gone are the semi-invisible monsters, and the game seems more cohesive and rational, rather than just a random collection of locations strung together. It still has the strange ""gate"" restriction where you have to get X number of gems to proceed, but if you get X+20 then the extra 20 are also taken from you, so where's the incentive to get more?It's very pretty, handles well, has an interesting story and is very enjoyable. Unfortunately it's very short and can be done in a couple of hours. There is a LOT of potential here and the game could easily be 3 or 4 times longer. There's plenty of room for more story, larger locations and more to do...I'd love to see a sequel or perhaps a level pack or something."

It mixes up the normal action with fun little mini-games, and the puzzles are never very difficult once you figure how to jump on critters.  The plot is kind've fun (if silly), and keeps the game from getting stale.Buy it on sale though, it only took me 2.2 hours to finish.  (I didn't try very hard to hunt for all the trophies/achievements, and found 1/2 the trophies)My only criticism is that, in some of the side-scrolling sequences, the double-jump is disabled w/o warning - so you might take a hit or two before you compensate.NOTE: It's much, much better than the free version of the game."

(The Day before) and watched the trailer of this game. To be honest I don't have a strong PC but still I could play the game from the beginning to the end. I really liked what I got for my money, really nice but sad atmosphere with a misterious story. Thats why I decided to buy it. A small robot who left alone in a world.. everything else just stopped working and he need to find out why.I really loved the music of everal stages in the game and can just recommend this game if you like platform games. The only thing I missed was the sound options to make the music more loud and the option of game saves. I was a little bit annoying to start over a stage when I died because of my FPS lags sometimes. But still I give 9/10 for this game!"

,Recommended,465760,33734871,Posted: 22 July,all,genoforprez,"As far as 3D platformers go, it admittedly does feel a teeny tiny bit on the cheezy/clunky side---especially when it comes to dealing with enemies and boss battles.The gameplay is often very simple, involving just a lot of traveling around the environment collecting scattered gems. BUT  you do get some (extremely easy) physics puzzles, switch puzzles, beam direction puzzles, etc, here and there, which does help keep things fresh.The narration and NPC voices are extremely corny, which may turn some people off (but may just remind other people of the 90s!). They can be skipped, but this may sometimes leave you confused about what you need to do to advance.TLDR: Might feel a bit too rough for people who aren't super enthusiastic about the genre, but if you have a lot of nostalgia or enthusiasm for 3D platformers, this game is good enough quality to give you a pleasant little fix---especially if you've exhausted all other available options.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is absolutely worth full price.6) A solid good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game that may or may not be quite worth full price.4) An alright game, but opinions are likely to strongly differ on the game's value.3) A bit rough, but with some interesting or redeeming qualities. Purchase with care!2) Quite rough. You may find something to like, but brace yourself. Purchase with care!1) Broken, unplayable, or otherwise impossible to recommend."
,Not Recommended,465760,32463942,Posted: 15 June,all,wizcreations,"Sure, the environments are somewhat pretty, though certainly not impressive, and yes, it's a 3D platformer, which is definitely NOT a new trait to the platformer genre... so how in the world does that mix make Scrap Garden an award-winning indie game!?  Nearly every aspect of this game is poorly designed and poorly implemented.  Here are my main gripes:Platforming elements consist of double-jumping onto everything with very sloppy controls.  The platforming never changes, never gets more difficult, and never even attempts to do anything innovative.Half of the boss fights require you to merely throw rocks at the boss's head.  The other half just have you dodge a few attacks until you reach the point where the boss suddenly dies.  Bosses are very poorly designed, both in method of beating them and in their clunky animations.Puzzle elements are dreadfully unimaginative.  Press switches in the indicated order, move a bunch of items into a box, or match the colored item to the same color switch.  Very boring!The camera view constantly positions directly overhead so you're always looking at the ground, or it positions so close to the robot that you can't see your surroundings.Checkpoints are few and far between.  The game is never difficult, but occasionally the sloppy controls will cause you to miss a jump or inadvertently get attacked.  These mistakes may lead you to die, which forces you to restart the entire area.  The game is not anywhere near good enough to want to play twice, and merely having to repeat the bland crystal collection is enough to make you resent the game if you die through little fault of your own.Enemies indoors hide just out of sight around a corner so they hit you nearly every time.  Enemies you can see outside can be easily killed by double jumping and falling straight down because they always stop directly underneath you (and all non-boss enemies are killed by jumping on them once).  Later in the game enemies will pop out of boxes that you open, which can cause you to die and force you to restart the entire level.The story is terrible, bland in content and full of errors within its own lore.  Sometimes the story just rushes forward without preamble, like in the second area where you are rushed from a cutscene of an unexplained encounter with random natives to boss fight and then to a location you've never even seen before.The voice narration is really bad.Audio is extremely loud and cannot be adjusted or muted in-game."

First, the game has a known bug that I have never seen before with multi-monitor setups where my mouse pointer was going outside of the game window (even when in full screen) and cause me to die because the mouse click was instead minimizing the game window. Second, I found that often being too close to a ledge prevented double-jump from working when trying to jump up onto the ledge and in one area an oversized collision box was interrupting my jump. Then during a portion near the end you have to click the right button at the right time but still I kept failing even though I clicked it when the circle turned green.Also the Narrator is very boring and that the game is too short for it's price. I bought it on a big sale, for $5 it felt like a good deal but the normal price of $15 is much too high for what you get.Overall it is a game that is very charming and fun most of the time but some aspects need to be patched up to prevent players from becoming frustrated enough to give up."

,Not Recommended,465760,32576305,Posted: 19 June,all,generalzee,"This is the most basic and boring platformer ever. It lacks any kind of unique mechanic, and most of what you do is wander around collecting random floating gems. There's basically nothing interesting going on, you're a robot, you've gotta restore power to the other robots because most of them ran out of power, but not you because you're so old. That's really the entire plot as far as I could see, and there was no implication that there was anything deeper or more interesting going on. Most enemies were dispatched with a simple jump like mario, but this game lacked all the wacky fun or pacing of a Mario game.Furthermore, I want to really emphasize how much I hated collecting all the gems on the first level, so I'd be prepared for the second, only to find that going from level to level drains your gems entirely, even if the ""cost"" is listed lower than the gems you have. It makes sticking around to enjoy a level pointless."

This would be more of a casual 3D Platformer instead of one made for hard core fans of the genre. The game is not hard and can be finished fairly quickly. The story and game play are okay, nothing to great but not horrible either. The biggest thing I see wrong with this game is the lack of polish.
