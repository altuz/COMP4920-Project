I couldn't believe that for early access there is so much more accomplished here than in Kings of Kung Fu. The dev definitely improved his skill since then and it shows.The visuals are absolutely beautiful. Some of the stages just blew me away with the detail that during the fights I found myself focusing more on the environment than the actual fight.Adding to the awesome experience, I was really impressed with the music and sound fx. It just adds that much more to the experience making it feel like you are taking part in a 1970's Kung Fu film.I'm in total shock that this is all done by one dev. I have to take my hat off to him. This is super impressive work.Now being an early access game I did expect to find some issues in the game. I noticed graphical glitches very rarely appearing throughout the game (sometimes at random or sometimes when changing the graphics settings), I also noticed character clipping when they were too close to each other, and an imbalanced AI fighting system. There were a few other bugs but nothing serious.Closing this up, all I can say is this game is definitely worth the $$$ and is an experience you should not miss. The dev put a lot of heart into it and as an early access game it's great to be a part of it to watch it get better with the patches and updates.This is definitely a game I will be playing quite often. You should give it a try too. :)"

If you like new or old kung-fu flicks you are doing yourself a disservice by not picking up this game. The fighting is easy to grasp, the attention to detail is fantastic, of both characters and backgrounds, and the soundtrack is energetic with a heavy influence from martial arts movies of yesteryear.  The developer had a vision that came to reality with Shaolin vs Wutang.  Do not let the early access fool you, this game feels complete and the developer Jae Lee just added 2 more characters to the roster a week ago.  I whole-heartedly recommed this title.Rating:  I would give all 5 fingers in my 5 Finger Death Punch!!"

,Recommended,466110,22886181,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,CheHueyMalcolm,"Graphics and Gameplay are definitely a step up from Kings of Kung Fu, some of the backgrounds in the stages are beautiful (especially the one with the fire, reminds me of something out of a SNK figher, simply amazing) Gameplay feels much tighter and more responsive than the first game, while not Street Fighter/Tekken ""fluid"" this is only an alpha and one can expect it to be tweaked and improved with timeMy only real gripe is that it sometimes felt like holding back to block rarely did anything. Tightening up block would make the game more enjoyable and less frustrating in my opinion.Overall, I'm satisified and I look forward to replaying the game in the future after a couple patches. If you're a fan of classic kung fu films, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan... etc then this is pretty much a must buy."

,Recommended,466110,33834569,Posted: 27 July,all,stuvik,"Okay, I've played over 5 hours on this game and I only bought the thing 5.5 hours ago. The first hour was me laughing like a maniac as the game flooded my senses with martials arts movie themes. This is a fun kung fu fighting game which delivers all of the movie nostaligia from martial arts cinema. An impressive variety of kung fu styles are represented by unbespoke characters who slightly resemble certain people of fame in a related industry.The controls are quite basic - using an XBox One controller there is no function for the triggers or LB/RB buttons. The game played fine on my ageing i7 + 980GTX + SSD system with graphics cranked up to max.Backgrounds and character details are lushious with martial arts postures of each character tuned to very fine detail. The music also draws you in again bringing that nostalgia right back again.I also love the fact that the character design isn't exaggerated. There's no excessive and obtrusive boob wobble on the female characters. All characters are as if they were pulled straight out of their respective movies when at their peak.I would have liked to have seen more variety of combos for each character but this game already ticks so many boxes in my childhood martial arts fighting game wish list I can live with the foibles in this incredibly affordable and entertaining game.The game is best played with a controller though apparently it is possible to play using keyboard controls. Good luck executing combos that way though.At the time of writing this I am about 7 characters into completing the game with each character and the only reason I stopped is because I need to rest my thumbs...and sleep...and work the next day. Yeah, they're kind of important.Despite it not being a complex game I will likely keep coming back to it long after I've completed the achievements. Probably the most fun game grinding experience I've had in a while.If you're a martial arts fan/movie buff, particularly Hong Kong cinema, this is definitely worth your consideration and as good a reason as any to go and buy a controller."

The characters and backgrounds draw from numerous eras and styles, the music is authentic, and overall presentation is strong for an indie title. Gameplay is not pro-tourney balanced but yields seriously fun matches once you figure out the basics. Ample variety to explore on the roster. As someone who imported many a Shaw Brothers classic on VHS back in the day, this was hardcore fan service. Well done!"
76561198085675458,Recommended,466110,33646263,Posted: 19 July,all,gamer,"I was interested in this game because of sense of nostalgia. When i was a little, tv stations in my country routinely ran old chinese kungfu. My favorite was drunken master because I really liked beggar soo/ sam seed. However, I bought this game only after reading positive review and i was not disappointed. The attacks are quite accurate and the fight is actually fast and fun.Moreover, the developer said that he is going to add more characters. I am so excited. In conclusion, Shaolin vs wutang first hook you with nostalgia then sold itself based on its gameplay.Jae Lee has actually made several fighting games before this, so probably He knew that in order to compete with similarly priced mortal kombat and blazblue, he has to keep adding new contents."

,Recommended,466110,31372984,Posted: 26 April,all,King Grimroc,"This is one of those games I wish I could leave a neutral recommendation for. Not an upvote, nor a downvote per se.It's not a terrible game, but it's not a great game either. I guess because it is early access this is to be expected. I mainly purchased it because I love classic Kung Fu cinema, and easily get the references in characters, soundtrack, etc... Thought it would be fun to have in my collection and play around with.It's actually pretty decent for a 1 man developed game. But if you are looking for a solid fighting game, I'd look elsewhere for something with more polish. This one is just passable right now. It still needs a lot of tweaking and balance. And since it is just a 1 man team, I'm sure this will be a slow process.As of the time of writing this you have a decent sized roster of combatants, with single and offline multiplayer, and a decent selection of stages and a few modes of traditional play.Where the game is having issues though that I hope might be tweaked would be the stiffness of moves, lack of diversity in pulling off secials, and other minor annoyances. Every character I have tried has the same list of required inputs to pull off specials, which all stem from quarter circle moves. No variety. There are also throw moves, and ""supers"" which are earned when filling up a meter. The ""super"" moves are all short in animation, and all performed the same way. This really gives the player zero incentive to practice the exeuction of moves for every character. I hope this is something that is fixed later on.In any case, I do love the homage to classic Kung Fu cinema. You have a good roster of fighters featuring mock ups from various movies including characters like Pai Mei, Beggar Su, The Drunken Master, Bruce Lee, and many others. Each with their own fighting style that I hope is expanded upon.Bottom line, if you like classic Kung Fu movies in the vein of Shaw Brothers, Golden Harvest and others, give this one a look. However, if you want a competent fighter to stand up to the likes of the Street Fighter, King of Fighters and Guilty Gear types of games, I'd probably avoid this one."
,Recommended,466110,22895861,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,Shirakani,"This game is a far improved offering over the dev's other game, Kings of Kung Fu. Where the other game fell short in execution and delivery, this game has largely fixed and it now actually feels like there is a solid engine and framework in place. While its DEFINITELY NOT a game catering to the hardcore FGC crowd, the important tropes that must exist do exist (such as deep jump ins, crossups, pokes, footsies, etc).'Execution requirements' is not even a thought. The game was never intended to be something you need a bible and 3 years of college to become good at a single character... Its a game where you can pick up and have fun pulling off cool moves. A basic overarching yet simple moveset links everything together and allows you to recreate moments from the old classic kung fu movies which the game takes its inspirations from with very little difficulty. However 'simple' does not mean 'baselessly shallow' like the previous game. This game does have enough depth to it to reward those who absolutely insist on getting the last 20% out of a character, as opposed to simply playing to 80%. Its simple, and yet rewarding.The game still has a number of kinks and flaws of course but it IS Early Access. Give it a chance to develop as it is a labor of love by a single guy."

At the same time, it also has a new game sorta vibe, it's very fresh in the movement and play, so when I say golden era I don't mean it plays like an old game. This is tough to put to words.It plays like an arcade classic. In its current form, it has a tournament mode.Game has a ton of charactors, ton of moves, killer stages, awesome music. I can't begin to imagine what the final completed game will be like.This game is a 4 button fighter with directional movement to adjust hit strength. A lot of crazy combo possiblities and exciting action when you are really getting in there.If you are a fan of classic (also golden era) Kung Fu films, and you are into fighting games, this could be the one."

(WELL DONE)- Great graphic art style and music that matched the theme of the kungfu world.- Real Kungfu, not those imagined moves.Cons- Still not yet polished, control and movement input abit delayed, but can be accepted since it still early access.- No story mode yet, only arcade mode available,hopefully will be great story mode available soon.- No Multiplayer yet (Not a big deal since nowadays most multiplayer game on Steam dead after few weeks)Personal comments and wishes for this game:- Dislike the half circle style of control like other fighting game, which I hope it will be like more toward button combo to execute the move.- Sometimes, Chinese martial art is about reversal, so add in reversal move will be an advance to this game to me.- Also, if it can when 2 people hit at sametime, will auto block and disengaged.- Split the weapon and hand to hand combat, or at least only allow weapon after grab up. (A real kong fu master can use several type of weapons, and most of the time weapon will only fight with weapon)Just start playing, if I had missed up something please forgive me.

Sayingthat, there's one really big problem which needs to be fixed if this is to get there, and that's the lack of mobility. A dash or run and more flexible jumping would open this game up immensly. as it currently stands, the mobilty is just above the level of Streets of Rage 1.

Love the animation of the fighters, and If you like martial arts films, in particular older Kung-Fu films; then the music and sound effects is nothing short of outstanding!Reminds me of the Karate game from the 90s (I think the one that gets played early-on in Bloodsport).Who is this developer?

I love the music & presentation.  The characters are great (need a Chuck Norris-type of character) and it's great to see so many from classic films.  That's the main draw.  The music, sound effects, and the recognizable fighters will probably appeal more to older player than younger ones as they may not be familiar with the movies referenced here.The fighting is pretty good.  It's definitely more of a throwback to early 90's fighting games that today's with all the goofy meters and special moves.  It reminds me a bit of Tekken's control scheme but not quite as fluid.  It could use some refining and definitely some more moves.  The music and sounds are mostly great and I like the graphical style.  It's definitely worth more than the price for me as a fan of old Kung-Fu films.  I hope this game continued support and a sequel down the line.

I had to figure out the moves at first but after a round, I caught on quickly. On the other hand, there is a little stiffness with some of the movements but I am sure after an update, it will be fixed.In closing of this review, the developer has put a lot of love and energy into creating a game that feels like the genuine article. And as a fan of martial arts, I deeply appreciate the love and care that has been taken to create interesting characters and picturesque environment (Btw, the market stage is pretty cool too. The dog doesn't even know the fight is going on, lol), and it just grabs you. If you have played the previous entry, Kings of Kung Fu, you will definitely love this one... #TeamWutang"

,Recommended,466110,29538143,Posted: 28 January,all,Mors Victrix,"This game really is a love letter to the old Kung Fu movies I remember watching when I was a kid. At the moment of writing the review, there is no singleplayer story mode, but as I understand the developper is working on it. I feel that a story mode would be a GREAT addition to the game in many ways. Among other it would make the characters feel more alive and have greater nostalgia value for the diehard Kung Fu movie fans out there.The game is nice and fun, characters have different fighting styles. In many ways it reminds me of the old 90s 2D fighting games like Mortal Kombat 3, only that the controls are much more simplistic and the fighting is more realistic (don't expect supernatural abilitys). The special moves have the same key combinations for all the characters, which for me is a good thing. The game is very simple and casual player friendly. As I understand the previous game by the same developer entitled ''Kings of Kung Fu'' is similar in nature but with more challenging gameplay, controls and mechanics.P.S.: When testing your controls setup be careful not to go into TRAINING mode, because it is meant strictly to train against the dummy or AI - P1vsP2 not supported. Because I didn't know this, I wasted my time trying to set it up for 2 people and even gave the game a negative review. lol"

As a big fan of the good old martial arts movie classics, I instantly had to buy it when I found out about Shaolin vs Wutang.The art style is just beautiful, incredibly well done, and when looking at the characters (18 in total and more to come) and their specific Kung Fu styles, I feel like being in one of those kick-♥♥♥ flicks I loved to watch as a kid and now as an adult. And come on, who didn't wish to be able to fight like that? Now here is your chance. Amazing moves are available, worthy of the Golden Harvest era.Each and every fighter offers distinctive punches, kicks, and -what's kinda new- also Kung Fu weapons, representing their fraction and style. Of course there are standard & special attacks and combos.Precision, distance and timing are rewarded, because you can try to go with spamming buttons, but you'll soon find limits then, especially on higher difficulties. Though there are not that many moves per fighter as in Kings of Kung Fu - which had a ton (also totally worth to get, btw) made by the same dev (nice guy, working hard to even increase the SvW's experience by cool updates), - there are enough, and along with the special attacks a tad easier to pull off, hence a bit less hard to master, but naturally you have to use them wisley to become an real expert in the fantastic arts of Shaolin and Wutang. ;)If you love Kung Fu, Kung Fu movies and or just superb fighting games with great looking graphics, this game is for you.Edit: This amazing game gets even better and better - not only with each update - the more you play the less you can't stop, that great are the moves and combos you can use. A real treat.It also made me rewatch Ip Man 2, Snake In The Eagle's Shadow, and Drunken Master will be next. More to follow I guess :D"

The music and stages together with many unique fighters combine to create a very unique experience unavailable elsewhere in the genre. It comes with the full barrage of game modes expected in a fighter (Arcade, Survival, Team Battle, Training) and a Tournament mode for extra fun.The controls for this game are simple (Punch, Kick, Weapon, Dash) and are easy to string together to create combos in the system using directional modifiers (Ex: P,P,P, --> P, K, K, --> K, <-- K). As nearly all 2D fighters it features quarter circle specials, supers, throws, and blocking by holding back. Where it excels is how easy it is to start doing cool things right away. Unlike its predecessor (Kings of Kung Fu) it is very responsive and you will not find yourself battling against the controls. The AI is very forgiving at easier levels and presents a decent challenge at higher levels.If you have ever enjoyed watching martial arts films with stars like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, you definitely owe it to yourself to check this gem out. It is a whole lot of fun, especially if you ever get together with a bunch of friends and play the Tournament mode!"

As a fan of Shaw Brothers films and Kung Fu flicks in general, I'd say the game captures the visuals effects, musical score, and style of those old movies perfectly! I'm in love with the great amount of characters and levels, however, I do think that the combos and movement could use a bit more polish. My main gripe is with the lack of dash or run options. Often I find myself using the dodge button to close the gap with opponents, only to leave myself wide open for an attack. A small problem I also have is how the characters only seem to have blank facial expressions, and sometimes there's weird clipping with some of the models (If you play Lotus Palm and look at her bangs in her winning pose, you'll see what I mean.) All that being said, this is a great game for kung fu fans and I'm very much looking forward to further updates!"

,Recommended,466110,27238051,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Daigoji Gai,"Like Kings of Kung Fu before it, this is another love letter from Jae Lee to Hong Kong cinema. Where the first film was a playful nod at the Hollywood interpretation of the genre, this goes traditional, with a focus on some of the iconic characters and styles that populated Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest films since the 60s (saw one reviewer said the 70s, um, you're off a decade - ""Come Drink With Me"" for example [the spiritual successor to Crouching Tiger and part of the Golden Swallow series]  1966 but some of the first of these films go back to 1949, with movies like ""The True Story of Wong Fei-hung"".)Enough history lesson, now about the game. Shaolin vs. WuTang shows several improvements over Kings of Kung Fu. The controls feel tighter and more responsive, each combatant has an ""authentic"" weapon associated with the combatant's style of fighting (or in the case of the Silver beared  master [think Pai Mei]) true to the nature of the character protrayed in films. The graphics show a huge improvement over Kings of Kung Fu, which, honestly released only a year ago, shows Jae Lee and his team are getting better. Like KOKF, all the moves are authentic, well animated and with the added bonus of slow motion special effects and a righteous ripped from Hong Kong cinema soundtrack.Someone complained about the lack of tutorial, and that's a rubbish complaint. Some of the best fighting games didn't have no stinking tutorials. You got a move list card and had to discover and figure it out yourself. Maybe I am showing my age, but have IQs dropped sharply while I was away? You don't need no stinking tutorial, there is a practice mode to hone your chops with and like Street Fighter 2 or Tekken 2, you are thrust into match after match with some character appropriate pre-match banter from the combatants. IMHO, the new frills, clean and focus on fighting is welcome, and if you need a hand holding tutorial, maybe you should go play a Pokemon game or something. FFS.I am going to be playing this a lot, and look forward to more updates with added stages. While I don't want (and bashed) the tutorial criticism, there is another game I recently discovered (Karate Master 2) that I would love Jae Lee & crew to tackle with a focus on old school Hong Kong cinema given their fighting system, animation style and attention to authentic detail.If you're knowledge of Hong Kong cinema extends beyond Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Donnie Yen, and you know who Gordon Liu, King Hu, Cheng Pei Pei, Chang Cheh, Run Run Shaw,  Feng Lu, Chien Sun aka IRON FEET YANG HU YUN,  Wai Pai and Kuan-Chun Chi are... YOU MUST PICK THIS UP [and also pick up Kings of Kung Fu for some 80s Hollywood kung fu film love)"

The game runs pretty smooth and the controls are fluid. Two problems I have with the game is the background music and the selection features. The music is great, but the background music needs to have a loop so there wouldn't be an awkward silence with two dudes grunting at each other. The selection features can use a small upgrade so it wouldn't look like I'm playing a flash game, but rather a Triple A game I look forward to play.

They also seem to back down when you pour your offense on them (even on the highest difficulty levels).  More aggressive and challenging AI will increase longevity (though what's here is fine to get the hang of how things play)Mobility is an issue (moving in and out of striking range easier/quicker for higher level play would be appreciated).  Would also appreciate the ability to quickly recover from falls to keep the action moving.The music at the monkey forest stage... please use something else, please.  It was a painful experience.^^Gameplay video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOs04cz3FYcAll considered, this is a game that deserves support and in a number of ways, moves fighting games in the right direction.  It's not a polished masterpiece and there are the rough edges you'd expect from an indie title, but it's so much fun to be this well-realized version of Bruce Lee (a selling point all its own).Recommended to all fans of the genre.. especially at a price of around 6 bucks."

,Recommended,466110,31496595,Posted: 1 May,all,wyulf,"shaolin vs wutang is not your typical fighting game. visually, it's pretty good to look at; from the characters, to the moves, this will definitely remind you of the old kung fu movies from the 70s or 80s. on top of which, the dev has even put in background music from those movies itself! so in terms of both the audio and visuals, this game will definitely take you back to another era, and in that sense, it's very well done.if you're looking for a competitive fighter however, the likes of street fighter, or king of fighters, or guilty gear, etc. then just maybe you're looking at the wrong game. the controls here feels a bit more loose, and personally, reminds me a lot of games such as say ... mortal kombat I perhaps. not entirely refined, but sufficient for a casual gamer who wants to jump into a fighter, without worrying too much about over-elaborate combos and all that.the moves available to each character is unique, and fun to look at, especially if you do manage to pull off a decent combo string. the commands however, are identical across the board for all characters it would seem, but again, this would suit a casual gamer too, as they wont have to memorize a whole ton of different commands, but instead just pick the fighter they like best, and still could execute their moves without problems.all in all, this is a fairly unique fighter. it's a lot of fun, even for myself who have spent over 20 years playing the likes of street fighter, king of fighters, tekken, etc. i really do like the nostalgic trip down memory lane, and that i dont have to overthink things playing this.besides, where else are you gonna pit donnie yen against jackie chan or bruce lee? highly recommended for fans of those old kung fu flicks, as well as anyone who wants to pick up a more casual fighter. looking forward to what other polishes and add-ons the dev will throw at it on full release."

I think it is really nice to play for it still being early access you still can play alone or get into a get set of rounds with friends. That brings me into one of the downsides which is no online multiplayer modes yet, really hope that happens with enough player support, Im dying for a good fighter on my PC since the genre is virtually dead on here.

Weapons are also on characters which is pretty cool.Overall this is great for the price And who doesnt love Kung Fu?!"

Let me say, I am more than pleased.This is the type of fighting game i've been waiting for. Simple to learn, hard to master type of controls/combos. Timing is a much more important factor in fights. The blocks and dodges are easily the best of any fighting game, they got the animations just perfect.The controls feel tight and responsive. The graphics are really good, and in my opinion the perfect style for what the game is.Cant really think of any negatives about this title."

And O!M!G! the dodging and blocking!3. COMBAT SYSTEM: Better combo system, more controllable.4. UI: Simplified Chinese!Cons:1. GRAPHIC: Some models have better modeling than some others. Especially SHAOLIN characters. Generally Light effect on models in darker stages are better. Sometimes there could be rendering error in some stages.(While playing in Jade Bridge stage, the boats were spinning XD)2.ANIMATION: Could do better in jumping animation.3.COMBAT SYSTEM: COMBO became almost the same for every character. Light->Medium->Special. However, this game doesn't need to be like the other traditional FTG.4.UI: Still some english text in simplified Chinese UI.5. OTHERS: I think developers must know what SHAOLIN and WUTANG are. Maybe there could be some explaination that the characters are fighting for SHAOLIN or WUDANG?  ""WUSHU"" Jet Li is actually using mixed kungfu but his reputation mainly came from ""洪拳"" and ""无影脚"".6. SOUND: Character voice could be a little louder.9/10Would love to see future update"

It's a great improvement over the developers previous game, Kings of Kung Fu, and is a great alternative for those who can't afford big budget fighting games like Street Fighter V or Mortal Kombat X. It brings realistic characters and arenas and has a great combat system. Many of the fighters resemble 1960's and 1970's Kung Fu movie actors like Brice Lee and Jackie Chan, and I love the idea. I look forward to future development on this game with new arenas, characters and possibly a story mode. I would like to see new characters that resemble Jean Claud Van Dam, Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris. I hope the devloper makes more fighting games after this because they have aq talent for this. 8/10 for me... Buy it A.S.A.P. and enjoy Kung Fu again."

This is from back in the day when Bruce Lee was everyones real-life super hero and ""special effects"" was based-on actual martial art skills (with some wire work hehe).  Oh, the game?  Yeah, it's good.  The characters look good (but, not the most detailed), close, but, not so close that they'd be a law-suit.  There's  a lot of work to smooth things out, but, the foundation is all in place.  I don't have KOK, but, from what I've seen, this is a big step-up in quality for this dev.  Loads of potential here to be a great game.  More moves needed and controller response, but, this is a true homage game.  If anything, I'd love to see a few more characters bought over from KOK.  This isn't a fireball spammer, for sure.  I will update as things develop."

,Not Recommended,466110,24428865,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Derptrog,"Okay, so I'm a huge fan of Kings of Kung Fu (the first game Jae Lee made). It had a small roster, but fighters with very unique flow, range, and tempo. The fighting styles all played completely differently, the combos were based off of a LK RK, LP RP system. Most of the moves made sense as far as advancing and retreating attacks, it punished you harshly for spamming, and you could flow most of the moves together into free form combos.Shaolin V Wutang however is a huge step back from Kings of Kung Fu. The flow is akward, there is no quick step, all of the moves don't flow into eachother. The left/right system is swapped out for a kick, punch, weapon, roll system(the telegraphed roll, being the only way to change up range quickly). All of this combined makes for a low tempo, stand and combo kind of fighting system. Gone is the constant range manipulation, and fast tempo organic combos from Kings of Kung Fu.Verdict: Buy Kings of Kung Fu, also buy this so Jae makes KOK2."
