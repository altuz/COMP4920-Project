76561198041728512,Recommended,466220,31222868,Posted: 18 April,all,Mr. Mackie,"Since my playtime is nearing 30 Hours this is my honest review.Positive Things :-Great developers, they have been fixing things these last few day.-The developers response to form post and are honestly trying to get everyone opinion of the game and what needs to change to improve the game.- Controller support.- Alot of classes to choose from and has the names of some future classes TBD- 16-bit MMO- Loot (keep playing after max level there is gear to get that is much better than what you most likely have)- Friendly Player Community in game.-Devs said they are planning to release one new map every month! (will be nice If they can meet their goal)-Only $6Negative Things :- Since I played before the stream release I was really hoping that the max level would be higher than lvl 30 at release because you can get max level in about 15 hours if no one boosts you.- Controller: Could not get PS$ remote to get detected. But using the steam controller you can use the thumbstick to move (unlike Xbox) and you can even type in game with it.- You can’t change the hotkeys.- Still alot of bugs in game. But just in the last few days they have fixed most of the major ones- annoying coin drop sounds needs to be quitter than the other soundsOverall:This game is Definitely worth the $6 asking price even at launch. Even a lot of new triple A title charge $60+ and only get around 30 hours of gameplay (so $2/hour play). But KOL at $6 is at around $0.50/hour play if you are only getting to level 30 more if you continue. The game is fun to play with or without friends (make new ones in game!) despite the negative points. In my opinion if the dev team keeps up their good work since this is only opening weekend of early access I believe that most if not all of my negative points will go away."
,Recommended,466220,31158845,Posted: 15 April,all,Cmdo.Delta,"I asked a refund and the reason is: it overloads CPU to 99% (almost crashed my PC lol)This said, I'll leave a positive review. The game is not bad. It's incredibly early access game but it works. Yes there are bugs but game was functionnal. I was able to move the character around, to kill enemies, to talk with some NCPs to sell/buy. Stats points were working, skill trees are very small right now but you can start to allocate few points. It gives a quick idea of the game and its potential.Just yes, it's early access. It requires works, alot of works. And it's the reason of my refund. Too often I bet money on early access projects that never came together. Those devs are a small team and so far they made no projects that would allow us to know if this project will end up in something else than money grabbing. It's the big unknown. So I'll wait a little longer before puttin money into it for real. Maybe by the time this game becomes something better, the price will increase but its fine. Looking at their youtube videos, they seem to work really hard and they would deserve that slighly higher amount of money. If they make it throught, they have a great chance to count me in their future players and maybe DLC buyers. Wish them good luck with their project.And to those who were whinning about controls... I was able to play the game with both mouse and/or keyboard.. you can click on enemies and objects... no need to use space bar if you don't like it... :/ it is really a bad reason to leave a negative review honestly. Shame! And probably in future, players will be able to modify key binding so why so much hate? It's just temporary controls. Instead of whining, bring ideas to devs and encourage them."
76561198089209749,Recommended,466220,31250309,Posted: 19 April,all,Sorra,"I've been a long-time supporter and player of Kingdom of Loot, so I may be biased as I say this: I recommend this game wholeheartedly. I could have used the Steam Key they had given me so I could play for free; however, I wanted to support them and the game. I believe that the KoL Team will be able to make this game a big success, as they have great plans for KoL, and I can't wait to see the game bear fruit. But I'm writing this as a review, so let me review it:The Team is constantly answering questions on the forums, as well as fixing bugs. The only issue that has made this game unplayable for me and many of the players were a CPU issue. HOWEVER, that has been patched, making the game so much more playable, and enjoyable. Everything is so much smoother and less laggy. They actually listen to the players of the game; leave a suggestion and more often than not, it will eventually be added to the game.The visuals for the game is amazing; breathtaking even. It honestly reminds me when I played Sword of Mana on my Gameboy. Each dungeon, forest, or cave will have their own design to it and as of right now,  there's no big similarities for any of the current locations. So, each location will be unique and different. The animations are smooth and fluid as well.There's currently five classes to choose from (sixth being the Cleric, and that will eventually be released); Knight, Mage, Gladiator, Rogue, and Archer. So if one does not match your play style, you can always change to a different one. However, as of writing this review, Rogue and Archer are lacking some skills, so beware.The Community has been very kind, as they aid you in leveling, giving gear, or even money at times. They are also extremely friendly to one another, I have yet to see an arguement occur. You can easily make some good friends here (I know I have over the years).Mining and Crafting is a thing in the game; except right now its currently just mining. Mining gives you the ability to mine for gems, and later down the line, materials for you to craft.The Max level is currently only 30, but in that time there's a lot of things to do to occupy your time. Two forests to go to (Beginner Forest and a Level 10 Forest), a Lost Temple (Level 5 Dungeon) to explore and find loot, and a Cave full of crystals (Level 10 Dungeon). The dungeons have different settings; Normal, Medium, Hard, and Insane. The higher the difficulty, the better experience and loot you obtain. As well as that, the Lost Temple and Cave give you ""Secrets"" to find; those will take you awhile.There are currently Trophies for killing enemies in the game under the ""Achievement"" tab in game, so if you're ever bored, you can do that. They are suppose to give out ""Starcoins"" per trophy rank, however that currently does not work. (There's three ranks for trophies, Bronze, Silver, Gold)There is a leaderboard so if you're a competitive person, you can try to become rank 1 of you're current server.I won't lie, the game has a lot of work to be done before it can be completed, there are no quests and bosses right now, which can bum some people out; however, their priorities lie elsewhere for now. But if you get this game, I don't think you'll be disappointed, as Presbyter (one of the Devs) mentioned they will try to release a new dungeon every month.I hope this review, if you can even call it that, helpful."

It IS true what they say about how it's lacking on many aspects of the game, but not really by the gameplay. I can live with it as long as I know the team is consistenly patching and listening to their players (and it's not difficult for a decent programmer to fix these things). For only $6, I will NOT refund the game because I am contributing to a game that has great potential, & I know it!If I see they nothing is being done and they're slacking on the updates, I will have to, quite frankly, reverse my payment. Sorry, although I believe they didn't come this far to have that be the case :)"

Everything this team touches is gold (or LOOT!!)! While the game is not up to modern graphic standards, it is intended to be that way- and i love it. Any 90's gamer who grew up on the likes of Secret of Mana, Zelda, etc.. should definitely give this a go. And for under $10 it is a steal! The community is small but very friendly just like in Seyken.Thank you, Pres and Team for this wonderful piece of Nostalgia :)"

76561198150318958,Recommended,466220,31684721,Posted: 11 May,all,BeachBanana,"This game, although not finished, is one of the greatest games I have ever played. The art style is amazing, the maps are fantastic and the community is wonderful. If you are looking for a game that you can sink many hours into and enjoy those hours, then get this game because with a party, doing loops around rainy ruins (highest lv area at the type of this review) is fun and stimulating. Furthermore, the community is so nice and we help each other out in many ways. However, there aren't many players on Rhea (US W) so I am usually solo grinding which isn't as much fun as grinding with a team. I hope to see more people in Rhea. Anyways, new updates come out almost every week (and sometimes more than once per week). This is awesome and shows how hard working the group behind Kingdom of Loot even though there aren't many people. This game states that it's a love child behind Secrets of Mana™ and Diablo™ which is true. However, for me, I played wonderking a long time ago and it reminded me of this in a way. It brought me back to this genre of games from modern fps.Recommendations and/or suggestions:Have an 1000 arrow button instead of just 10. (Clicking gets really annoying just to get 25k arrows). Please.I know the devs are working on the auto attack and mechanics of the game but I'm going to stay this anyways -Auto attack should focus monsters first, then hives, then mining. It gets really annoying when I'm trying to run and I just attack a hive or start mining. It really throws of concentration.Holding down the space bar is somewhat glitched because as a ranger, when I hold the space button down, it stop for a second and then starts shooting, then stop again because there is nothing selected. Overall, holding down the space button needs improvements (really needs fixing because I don't want to spam my space button all day when grinding).Also, sometimes buttons feels unresponsive when I'm spamming many at the same time. This should be smoothened out more in future updates.This is the most of my recommendations right now.Thanks guys for making such a great game. I can't wait for future updates!"

This game has a great soundtrack, with a touch of nostalgia in the music and the graphics. I believe there is much to come from this game. A great pick-up for the price."
76561198037126501,Recommended,466220,31149316,Posted: 14 April,all,Glowthchch,"I had a lot of fun playing this game. I would describe this game as relaxing, the musics great, sounds are nice, it feels like I have the freedom to do what I want. I can mine to get gems to slot into my gear, I can grind mobs, I can grind dungeons to progress to the next dungeon difficulty level, and while doing all of this I get loads of loot. Now this is a mmo, you need to make groups and make friends to get the most out what this game has to offer. It's really easy to get people together, make an open party, talk to people, invite people, or just apply to join an already open party. You're going to be playing a mmo socialize, explore, grind, and have fun."

Sometimes I crave a simpler MMO; run out of town, kill stuff, get loot, sell loot, repeat.  This game seems to fit the bill fo far!  Glad to see that someone out there has also imagined a SNES era rpg turned mmo - it's something I've wanted since I first played Secret of Mana.We need tweaks here and there, but I didn't find the controls to be as bad as some have indicated.Could use keybind options (unless I've missed them).Light download, runs well!Keep it up devs :)  Can't wait to see what you do with it."
,Recommended,466220,31390804,Posted: 27 April,all,JonChong,"Lots of fun with friends who love old school RPGs. It sounds like a lot has improved compared to the older reviews or at least in terms of major bugs. Combat is relatively bland. There's almost no direction in the beginning. I think I am missing a skill as a Rogue compared to my friend who is playing a Knight because it is still in development. Team work makes the game go way smoother. I would recommend three people minimum. Two was bearable but a bit taxing. I cannot imagine playing this by myself. I can't wait to get two more people to play with me. There's still a lot of room to improve, but if you play with friends, it can still be a lot of fun."

If you enjoy classic-styled RPGs this will be right up your alley.Unfortunately, the many quirks currently present in the game are somewhat frustrating and I can't see myself playing until they are fixed.

No purpose in this game, no instruction or ANYTHING to do. Save your time and money. It's early access but at this point its far from even being considered a game."
,Not Recommended,466220,31141908,Posted: 14 April,all,MechaDangerous,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:Oh my lord this is hot garbage. Here are some bullet points:* Graphics. The pixel art is cute. It has that going for it. Full-screening the game is only done by pressing SHIFT+F. Going through menus helps a LOT.* Sound. Typical 8/16-bit here. Pretty nice. However the coin sound or whatever sound that is when money/loot drops is INSANELY loud. Holy bejesus I needed to turn my speakers practically off! Will need to investigate menus to find out how to address this.* Controls. Space to attack? Really? Shift+Space to pick things up? DEL+Enter to cancel a party invite? Who the hell thought this was a good idea?* Chat. This is supposed to be an MMO, or something at least resembling an MMO. Chat is limited to 12 characters per line. You cannot use your space bar. I don't think anybody tested actual typing.EDIT to CHAT: This seems to be a bug. A fellow gamer stated that he had to log out and back in and it seemed to fix it. I can confirm that that worked for me as well.* Combat. Space is to attack. That's...weird. I decided to use Mouse Button 1 to attack instead. This is also click-to-move, so that caused quite a bit of confusion for me. Plus targeting enemies with the mouse is something you need to get used to.There's so much more I could go on about, but I just can't. This honestly left such a sour taste in my mouth that I just feel ripped off. I know a lot of people were looking forward to this, but I honestly hope people think twice before purchasing this, at least until they put in a LOT of work making this even a little better.For those of you questioning my review due to my time with the game, that is honestly all the time it took for me to want to get very far away from this game. I just couldn't bring myself to play it any more in it's current state.For it's current entry price of $6.74 (25% off), there's no harm in taking my review with a grain of salt and trying it for yourself. As much as I'm voicing my opinions after such a short time with the game, the absolute best way for you to form your own opinion is always going to be trying it for yoruself."
,Recommended,466220,31676933,Posted: 10 May,all,Xye,"This is my very first review so forgive me if it's not the greatest.There isn't much to do in the game at the moment except grind. However, the developers are working hard to fix bugs before implementing additional  content. They listen to suggestions given by players, are quick to answer questions and issue updates at least once a week. I think this game has huge potential, despite lacking in content. I think they're doing great so far for a small team consisting of only 4 people + a couple of freelancers.There are  no storylines, guilds, or quests right now but you can complete dungeons, aim for number one in  rankings, unlock all trophies/achievements, or look for the very first unique item and best ring in the game at the moment. And if you don't mind doing it all over again, you can make a new character under a different class and repeat the process."

There's a lot be done and there's a lot to improve.With that said, this game has great potential.The 8-bit artwork is marvellous, and it gives a feeling of nostalgia.The developers work day and night, and there's weekly reports of what's been improved, what's been noticed.Just as Early-Access should be, the players and the developers keep a link of communication to make the game better and remove it's flaws.This game will probably be very enjoyable in 5 or 6 months from now, if it keeps going at this pace.So I recommend this game to people who want to support it in this very early stage of development.By now, music and sound effects, playability and in-game content are, for me, very shallow and generic. But as I said, there's plenty of room for improvement, and we can see developers effort on a week basis.After all, it's up to you. If you're feeling adventurous, this game is a good option to put your money in.If not, just wait some more time and check it again."
76561198284469597,Recommended,466220,33614476,Posted: 17 July,all,Eri,"Pretty fun for an alpha release, it certainly has a long way to go though. Not many skills to play around with yet, the loot is very monotonous and often the same junk drops with the same stats time after time.Typically the gear in the shop is stronger than anything you can find dropped right now. I've only seen one orange item so far multiple times which is a ring, you can find it more often in the newbie area than other dungeons.Completing dungeons is not very rewarding yet, the difficulty and drops between normal and insane are not very different at all. You can gain exp and money faster running around lower level areas one-shot killing big groups of weak monsters. Your exp comes in the form of blue crystals dropped by monsters, so the faster and more you kill the faster you level.Monsters are all slow and dumb, no MVP or boss type monsters running around to give you a challenge.Despite the glaring problems this is bare-bones beginning of development, I look forward to seeing how this game turns out in time and can't wait to play necromancer class when it comes out."

Expect your character to die a few times because solo-ing is big challenge. People will be looking out for a party as much as you are but don't be shy to invite others. The game forces you to find a party which seems very easy (you'll find levelling and exploring dungeons a lot easier) and makes for enjoyable gameplay.As this is early access, I won't be nitpicky and point out all the bugs because I'm sure the dev team is aware of them!

This review is for people like me, who look for certain qualities in a game.You should play this game if:1) You like being the best. I myself am highly competitive and as this game has not even been out a month, the opportunity for you to climb the leaderboards is there.2) You like grinding. I'm not talking about an hour or two and then having the best items. All items are randomly generated so you can grind for 50 plus hours and not have the best bow. This is a positive in my mind as it adds a ton of replayability.You should not play this game if:1) You want a complete game now -- This game is early access and developers communicate with us on a daily basis. If you dont have realistic expectations then you WILL be disappointed.2) You expect instant gratification. Grinding in this game takes many hours.**Final Thoughts**Get the game.

,Recommended,466220,33421234,Posted: 9 July,all,APM,"Credentials: I've played one character class to the current max level and toyed around with a few others.This game has a solid combat and loot system, which are the most important parts of an ARPG.  Getting new loot drops can drastically increase your power, allowing you to venture into new areas and make faster progress.  Dungeons and gear both have level requirements, and leveling also nets you some stat and skill points.  Skill trees are straightforward and there's plenty of opportunities to move points around as you level.  Fighting above your level is appropriately difficult, and it is usually not productive without a party.The various open world areas and instanced dungeons are well designed and interesting to work through whether solo or with a party.  Even in alpha they have a nice variety of enemies as well as levers, puzzles, and secret areas.  Checkpoints typically unlock progress and also keep death from being too much of an annoyance as they provide a place to respawn with no penalty upon death.  Dungeons are designed to be run multiple times, and each successful run counts toward unlocking harder and more rewarding versions of the dungeon - this is currently just higher level enemies, but there's other interesting things they could do with this.The downside is typical alpha stuff - there's not a lot of content yet aside from going into dungeons, killing monsters, and taking their stuff.  The loot system is good, but it needs to be fleshed out with more uniques, sets, and interesting modifiers.  There's only one quest and it's standard collection fare, but it works pretty well and shows that the quest system is viable.  Harvesting and crafting are in, but they currently involve socketing one harvestable gem or one quest reward gem into items.  Not particularly interesting, but, again, it shows that these systems are working.Controls are occasionally awkward with multi-key input inssues, but you eventually learn the quirks and learn to work around them.  Lag is sometimes a problem, but it has never been bad enough to cause me to quit a playing session.  It does occasionally result in death, but as I mentioned above, death is not a huge setback by any means.The biggest positive for the game is that the dev staff are updating regularly, post regular articles about progress and future goals, and actively respond to community input and bug reports.If you're looking for a finished game with tons of content, this is not for you, but if you're interested in a Secret of Mana MMO with Diablo-esque loot with a lot of potential, there's a lot of fun to be had.  The active community is small, which means it's easy to be listened to if you are willing to give thoughtful feedback."

The gameplay is fun and smooth and very nicely built to accommodate single players and groups of 2-5 with a reasonable amount of game time. The graphics and design of the levels is actually amazing for a game that is this far in development.After about 3-4 hours of gametime you may hit a brick wall, as you will notice the significant lack of content past the first 2 dungeons, but this should only be a problem until the next few instances and dungeons come out, right now it may not be a game you want to buy, as it will not immediately provide you with a lot of gametime unless you enjoy grinding for better gear as more of a looting game rather than adventure/rpg. Consider the price of 8,99€ more of an investment toward making the game better and supporting the developer, rather than the price of a finished game.One drawback of the game is that it is currently only available in a small windowed mode and the settings tab does not have an option to mute the combat noises or ambient music. Many minor bugs exist, such as not being able to dye your character after hitting level 20 and pressing the ""unlock skills"" button. All classes are gender-locked for the time being though this isn't necessarily a bad thing, unless you live on tumblr and live off of other people's irritation.A nice sign of progress is the fact that the servers are updated on a weekly basis with new additions/fixes/changes to the game, and the developer is actively working towards fixing all the bugs whenever one is reported, and is very open to community feedback and suggestions concerning future features of the game."

Except the game is in EARLY ACCESS I bought the game knowing there was going to be problems. The whole point of Early Access is to pretty much review the game and see it progress. I would say stay away from the reviews and try the game out for yourself. It's only Six Dollars! which is pretty cheap for an mmo type of game and it helps the developers make the game better. Criticism is good for games that havent released yet and I dont think people should just mass dislike it because of how it is in Early Access because the developers can always improve and make the game better till it releases. The controls are very weird, but in no way impact gameplay as much as I have played so far, but the Servers crashed because so many people got on right away, this is told to everyone the moment you log onto the game saying that the servers may do this, so you should already expect the servers to crash every so often. I will play this game more and if it really is a bad game I will not recommend it, but for now I am going to keep playing and keep this as a yes to play it for yourself."

You press attack and pray that your char chooses the target you want, second, you only have one attack! Loot is great, but is boring to keep pressing same button as attack to get the loot, Style of play remembers a 8bit game, not a 16 bit, any game of 16bit combat system is much more fluid and dynamic.  Enemy´s re-spawn out of nowhere and it´s not beatiful, since they could came from outside the screen, you guys could take a look on the basics of the game before moving on ( like creating a new character).

It's simple and fun.  Easy to learn sure it does some oddball things at the moment. Like loads the two shops each time ya login with any character when you speak with the NPC  You have to figure stuff out on your own no manual. You just have to muddle through or ask for assistance in mostly friendly chat.  Not hard to get a group most of the time. You can solo most everything in the game. As long as you don't have the survival instincts of a dead goat or a deathwish like every character you ever escort anywhere in any game ever.Just keep in mind it's still early access not everything is in yet.  There's plenty of loot, just like anyother diablo, grim dawn D&D game most of it is junk, some of it is decent, and handful of it is good.  It's got that secret of mana SNES feel with RNG loot system. Which for getting better loot for people is calulating the odds, praying, sacificing animals, and pure dumb luck.The characters are all gender locked deal breaker for some, as people like to make characters their own. There is mild color changes your can do with paint and dyes, but that's about it. Overall it's probably gonna stay gender locked, Not a big deal to me. You can whine ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain like a Sailor for them to change it, or you just accept you have no power over it and just enjoy the game for what it is or will be.The only minor current pet peeves are the Archer's never ending quest to buy more arrows. and the price scaling for potions is abit odd  which will probably change some as the game develops.Mainly I'm looking forward to seeing them flesh out the world more as from buying a ship and sailing around it's fairly large I think it's fun game to play with every now and again like the original river city ransom which i still play on my 3ds.  I currently treat as a beat'em up game and just wander around figuring out the current classes.The first dungeon is huge comepared to the second one.

I couldnt even type numbers in the chat, which is needed if you want to trade more than one of an item, like potions.- Everything is so roundabout in terms of control. To sell stuff you need to click and drag every item by itseld onto the sell button. To move items in your inventory, you have to move another item from its place to make space, so you can drag the other item you want there in that slot. im glad i didnt try to play with my keyboard, because those controls are even more horrendous than playing with a gamepad.- even moving around and attacking is clunky and your character often stops to do either because the game cant handle multiple inputs well.- ive played the 2h swordsman, my friend the fire mage. for 2 hours we did nothing but press one button over and over again, because the first real active skill is unlocked at lvl 15. we had to grind lvl 2 mobs until we were level 7, so we could deal enough damage to lvl 3 mobs. then we grinded those to lvl 9 so we could finally start grinding on lvl 5 mobs. the progression in this game is one of the worst ive seen in any game.- bugs at every corner, like being forced to unstuck automatically, ending up in the black space outside the map, not being able to use the chat anymore, not being able to open menus, not being able to attack.tbh, i didnt know the game was coded in java...which is probably THE worst language to program an mmo in. also the game in its current form is an alpha of an alpha of an alpha. anyone can slap together a better game using rpg maker in a single week. 10 years ago, you could download a game like this as shareware from some random online portal as a demo and youd scrap it as fast as installed it. this is an insult to diablo AND secret of mana."

Movement is clunky playing as a mage if you cast you cannot move right after unless you double / tripple click / hit a movement direction. So you esentially get locked on the spot cast can't move > Get hit > move > stick to the spot and so on.This makes it very difficult to dodge damage as it seems very random if the game is going to let you move or if it's just going to root you to the spot.Put me off very early.

As old-school grinding mobs seems to be a core point of the game, the fighting being so poor really turned me off as soon as I started.Secondly, the stat system doesn't actually allow for choice, as there really doesn't seem to be any tangible benefits from certain stats for some characters. If wrong choices only serve as a noob trap, then there shouldn't be any options in the first place (and this is coming from someone who no-lifed Ragnarok Online back in the day and loved the fact that you could craft your own little build and make it work).Thirdly, gear also outweights levels by such a margin I don't actually see the point in having a level system at all. The system isn't being used for a purpose, it's just there.Love the idea, dissapointed by the execution, these aren't things that typically get ironed out in alpha/beta, these are core mechanics that need to be in place before further systems are built ontop of them to flesh out the game.

All that matters now is if the dev team continue to bring life into the game for years to come, this could evolve as one of the best MMORPG around. Sadly A lot of games like this become abandoned and I hope that does not happen. Only time will tell and playing it as of now is worth it. Just dont expect a lot of content as it is still early access. It also does take time to get use to the clunkiness but it just becomes part of the game."
76561198093901549,Not Recommended,466220,31875578,Posted: 20 May,all,Waifu Willies,"Currently, there's a lot wrong with this game that makes me question what the developers are prioritizing. I bought this game on release thinking it'd be great in the near future, but not a lot has changed in three months. Current issues with the game include:-One quest...yes. One quest in the entire game. The questboard is not available.-No controller support (at least on my end. Used to work but doesn't now for some reason.)-Weird keyboard and mouse controls. CTRL serves as the loot button instead of something more reasonable like F or E.-Sound design is a bit quiet. You just hear the monotone background music and your characters attacks. It makes the game feel more empty than it should given there's always a group of enemies in an area.-Cleric class has been in development for around 3 months.-Escape screen UI has now been replaced with a placeholder, which looks worse than before.-While the game is in fullscreen mode upon startup, you can't escape the game by alt+tabbing and using the windows task bar. You will have to either use Task Manager and end the process or go in-game to exit.Apart from all that I listed, it's a fun concept and I do hope it does receive the love it deserves. As you can see by the hours i've played, which is not many, I haven't explored all there is to it and I am probably missing aspects to the game. However, given that there's no clear point A to B in the development cycle or in-game, I can't recommend the game in its current state."

For an early access it has gotten me excited for the rest of the game and i recommend you to try it. I can easily say i have gotten my 7$ worth and im not even max level yet.One complaint i do have though is that the rogue class is at a severe disadvantage. I'm still having trouble soloing lvl 10 mobs without using a 50g pot each mob..........and im lvl 26. Also not all the rogues skills are even out yet. You shouldn't have released a class that was unfinished.

,Recommended,466220,31163509,Posted: 15 April,all,Altumnus,"Overall, I feel like this game has provided entertainment worth the $6.74 I paid for it, and I plan on playing more of it. It was released one day ago, and I've only experienced one disconnect and one major bug (got stuck inside a wall, but relogging fixed thatThis issue has since been fixed).Pros:Cute artEnjoyable musicMultiple classes (5 available now: Knight, Fire Mage, Gladiator, Archer, Rogue) with more on the way (Cleric, Pirate, Duelist, Viking, Necromancer, Samurai, Paladin, Ninja, Temptress, Valkyre, Gunslinger, Battlemage)Cons with workaroundsCertain SFX are too loud, mainly the loot drop sound effect. Adjusting the SFX slider in the Settings menu helps a lot.FixedThere's a bug with chat (can't use spaces in chat) if you just created your character, but relogging fixes it.Fixed.Weird key combos according to the in-game help, which can mostly be ignored if you just use a mouse (e.g., pick up loot using left-click instead of Shift + Space when your cursor is over the item).Can only right-click to equip if the slot is empty, but fortunately you can also right-click on the paper doll to unequip.Can only delete a character through the website instead of in-game, though the devs are adding this ability into the game in a future patch.Cons:Inventory management is a hassle, since you can only move items into an empty slot instead of swapping slots.If you see an enemy's attack animation, you've already been hit. Kiting requires sprinting (Shift key) early enough that enemies can't fire off their animation.Keyboard's spacebar will take a beating, as using the LMB to attack is unreliable since it's also the click-to-move button. There's no attack toggle.Edited on 04/15/2017 for formattingEdited on 04/19/2017 for updated information about deleting a character, and deleted con about skill treesEdited on 05/02/2017 to reflect game updates"

76561198027328746,Recommended,466220,34004776,Posted: 3 August,all,Raven,"---ORIGINAL REVIEW---8/3/2017Well...I'm having trouble with this game at the moment, not because there are too many bugs, or because there isn't enough content.  No.  My main complaint is the glaring lack of polish on any of the games classes (from personal experience and from reading comments in the forums).  I've been playing the archer class now for a while and have leveled to 8.  My biggest issue is dynamic in that it's really more than one issue, instead it's kind of several little related issues that lead to an underwhelming gaming experience.First off, there are really only two areas for a character to test their salt in the early stages of the game--the forest and the first challenge dungeon.  The forest must be, I repeat, MUST BE, farmed at least until level 6 or 7 for solo play just to accumulate enough gold and to either find or buy semi-decent gear (decent enough to hazard a first-run through of the 1st challenge dungeon).  The forest itself won't take long to get through as it's relatively small.  Having to repeatedly farm it gets a bit too grindy even for me--a guy who loves games like FF, Secrets of Grindia, etc.This doesn't sound that bad really, until you realize that your character classes are as vanilla as they come, most suffering from a complete lack of SPECIAL ANYTHING and instead relying on lackluster passive abilities which pretty much just increase damage output.  One thing I found perplexing is the archer's pitiful range and lack of specialty shots.  You can barely eek out two arrow shots before you need to kite mobs around the map frantically trying to avoid being hit by even the most wimp-tastic early game mobs.  I find myself just buying extra healing potions just so I don't have to constantly retreat from enemy archers (in the 1st challenge dungeon) who are lower level than me, but can still shoot further and seemingly faster than me.None of this would seem that bad on its own as it might be construed as a challenge to overcome, but here's the thing...  Most of the time enemy archers are in the midst of a pile of melee mobs which don't pull easily by themselves, and there's usually more than one archer to contend with at any given time.  Not only that, but in the first challenge dungeon, the mobs all regenerate health making them THAT much harder to kill without exhausting your supply of healing potions.My recommendation to anyone looking to play this unpolished, unfinished game in its current state would be to find a friend or two to play with.  At the moment playing solo isn't even fun (IMO) at low levels, which for an MMO seems counterintuitive and fundamentally flawed.I'm not going to say ""NO"" to this game, because I think it has a lot of potential.  It's got elements of Zelda, Secret of Mana, etc. that I really enjoy.  But at present I would only recommend this game if you have a lot of patience and at least one other friend willing to join you consistently in-party to get through the current lack of flexibility.  I'll update this review from time-to-time as updates to the game occur and/or my thoughts, feelings, or opinions change based on further gameplay.  Until then, happy hunting!"
