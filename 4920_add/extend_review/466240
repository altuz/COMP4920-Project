One player stands out specifically. First couple games being Infected I didnt understand fully what to do. He was Infected with me and because ""I alone"" caused us to lose. Everytime I was thrown in a game with him, he'd non-stop tell me how trash I was over ingame chat and down me 24/7 making playing this game pointless for me. Reporting seems to have no real consequences seeing as myself as well as other players reported but Id get him in EVERY match.If you can get a group of 6, play. If not the randoms are so unfriendly."

This is the only online mafia-style game that can simulate how mafia works, replacing reads on physical reactions and body movements with evaluation of their actions and position ingame. The primary complaint I have is that it is far too hard for Infected to win. This could be pretty easily fixed with less overpowered protective devices available or making Infected need less bloodbags to execute."

,Recommended,466240,30659408,Posted: 21 March,all,JimFace.Jpg,"**SYNOPSIS** The Game Master has kidnapped six players and locked them away in a remote location. Two out of the six players are infected and must kill the innocent players before they escape. The innocent players must escape the Game Masters arena while simultaneously trying to figure who the two infected players are.This type of game is a classic ""who is my enemy and who is my friend"" because you truly cannot trust anyone in this game no matter what they say or do.**CONS**- Game sometimes lags in certain areas of the maps- As of now, 3/21/2017, there are only two maps and they get boring pretty fast- Cameras are WAY too powerful against the infected when they are in Terror Form- Asian players invade the NA servers so you may get into a game where no one speaks your language- Some players go on shooting sprees to simply rank up their perks and it ruins the depth of the game- Cosmetics. I added this because having very specific cosmetics that you unlock can ruin the fun for this type of game. The idea that everyone looks the same makes it difficult to differentiate between two characters which is fun. People can now just say, ""OH IT'S THE GUY WITHOUT THE SHIRT AND THE GREEN ST. PATTY'S DAY HAT."" and he becomes a SUPER easy target to find.- YOU NEED A MICROPHONE TO PLAY EFFECTIVELY- Alot of people play with their friends and only chat in discord or Teamspeak ruining the immersion.**PROS**- Every round feels ""new"" because of the new group of players you are playing with- Dev's have been releasing updates pretty often to fix bugs amongst other things- Decent price for a decent game- Have only had game crash twice out of the 21 hours i've playedWould I recommend this game? Yes. Does it have potential? Yes. Will I continue playing it? Yes."

,Recommended,466240,30322159,Posted: 4 March,all,RAIZO,"I gotta say, despite some bugs (which is expected at this point in the game's release) this game is fantastic. The premise: 6 players wake up in an asylum or a forest with a gun nearby but the catch is that 2 of the players are infected and can 'Hulk' out when the lights go out, allowing them to easily kill the innocent players when in beast form, then transform back again. You'll need to reach the next area once the lights come back on as the area you were previously in is getting gased for something, so you'll suffocate otherwise. And that goes for the infected players as well.There are achievements, multiple cosmetics to unlock, a leveling system and the game runs pretty smoothly when working properly. There is huge potential here, so don't give up on this game. Now's the time to get it as it still seems to be pretty popular."

This game by Automaton already seems different. They released EA to genuinely catch bugs and test the game, and for helping them you get the game at a discount price. Condeming them for having bugs on day 1 is crazy as this is how the platform of EA should be used. Here's to the future of this game, because in its early stage it's still awesome."
,Recommended,466240,26069114,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,SpectreKombat-Twitch,"To me, Deceit is an excellent party game. The rounds go by extremely quickly - out of 6 people in your lobby 2 will be infected. It feels like a mini game of one of my favorite movies ""The Thing"". Voice chat is nearly essential with people throwing out accusations about who is infected.Deceit is in early access, and I have encountered two dropped games in the 6 hours or so I have played. I have gotten stuck in the wall once after being revived.... that being said it runs extremely smoothly. The players contstantly fighting (or teaming up) for the few items per level, plus the lights going out every minute or so really amp up the feeling of panic as you try to work together to escape the asylum.I think my favorite part of the game at the moment is actually being one of the infected. While the lights are on, I can race around for the same objectives as everyone else, and I know I have one loyal team mate. I can cower in the corner or behind furniture with anyone else as the power fails.... and just before the lights are about to restart - eat some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that thought he had an ally. FUN"
,Not Recommended,466240,30744733,Posted: 26 March,all,Earthless,"Learn Chinese Simulator 2017.I can't possibly in good faith recommend the game as it currently is.tldr; Latest update has fixed nothing, brought new bugs such as the crate name being messy '@UI_CRATE #11', and even brought back old bugs like gas zones both being deadly which now happens more often. At least they aligned the pistol sights to the centre of the screen and made it accurate when aiming down sights though! Right guys?Money grab by devs, soon to implement paid for skins by the looks of things (items still have [PRICE HERE] embedded into them...), and the game is buggy as hell and only gets worse, and has a toxic community.STAY AWAY! Buy on sale perhaps for $4.99.Pros:- Amazing gameplay in a vacuum.- When you do eventually get a good game, the gameplay is engaging and fun.- Character select screen is the lobby from the original Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombie map ;)- Can level up your character and earn perks.- Can unlock costumes for your charactersCons:- Buggy AF.- Toxic community- Only two maps which get tired real fast- Developers keep adding in mostly skins vs 5-10% legitimate bug fixes (of which there are many) which often end up creating new peculiar bugs anyway. Remember this is not an EA game, this isn't good enough.- Mouse will be rendered useless one in every 3 games upon joining the game (latest 1GB update did this for me)- In order to make the game playable and not run at 20 fps I have to go into settings and select 'Low' which increases frames. But doing this in the main menu DOESN'T STICK. You have to do it for every game you get into!- Half games will start with my mouse curser activated in game... One game I was blessed to have the middle click scroll button as my cursor.- Game crashes for me once every 8-10 games or so.- Often matched with Asians who cannot speak english. Not their fault, but why match Australians, Americans, and other English speaking people with Chinese servers in a game where voice communication is vital?- This is more a discontent with human psychology than the game, but people are incredibly stupid in this game and because of this you'll find you only really get a decent game one every 3 or 4 games, not including game crashes, because other innocents will vote you out immediately in the first round because you ""were standing next to empty blood bag therefore infected"". Lumped in with this are people who play in small groups of 3+ and just randomly eliminate people together within the first round. Alot of people do play together/you can tell they are queued with each other but actually play the game properly, props. Anyway, I guess the votekick happy meta will evolve once people learn the game more.- The ADS crosshair is 2 cm below the centre of the screen, and accuracy is congruent with this. You're better off aiming from hip with guns.All of this aside, if there were global servers and you played with a group of 6 friends (without any collusion), this would be an amazing game. Can't recommend for $15 at present build. This isn't even an Early release and it crashes more than EA titles!"
,Not Recommended,466240,30320906,Posted: 4 March,all,jared,"I would like to vote this up as the idea seems pretty cool, but I couldn't comment on it because of the absurd amount of times the game crashes.It's one thing to be in early access, but to release the game in a state where you crash within 1 minute of getting in a game is a little premature.Queue times are reported to be 10+ minutes at times, I've been lucky to get them within 5 however. Can't blame them for this though I think, it is the first day.Not recommended, you can't even play this game without crashing."

Learning that someone you thought was infected turned out to be innocent or vice-versa is the golden element that has me coming back round after round.  Again, playing with friends is the way to go.  Playing with randoms has only been frustrating in my experience, so I would recommend avoiding it.  Also, you're infected; I don't trust you."

,Recommended,466240,30680242,Posted: 22 March,all,Ivyory,"There's aspects that I enjoy from this game very greatly. I cannot express the amount of fun I've had within my first hours of this game. While still in development, and at a fast rate the (shockingly little) amount of issues I've had will most likely be fixed soon. The gameplay is fluent, in combination with probably some of the best online social experiences I've had, wraps up to be one of the best investments of 15 USD in a while.The balance of the game is on a whole other level. The element of surprise is what will lead to your victory-- whether it be attacking early and efficiently, to following an Infected player and closely surveying them until the final moment. The first-person skill ramp will get you out alive, in key with your past experiences and gamesense. Your teammates are threats as well, though mellow ones. Acusations and will fly like fresh hotcakes on a griddle if something isn't right. While you cannot harm the Infected while transformed, if their barrage of their own body is not effective, they will most likely die immediately after.I see almost everything within this game having some sort of counter-play. Unless an unlucky game is given and three people have cameras, you can easily target and destroy the one, or even two people with them. All items in this game are useful!! In combination, the way Infected can hoarde ammo, loot, and armor is only more enjoyable to watch, as you see the rest of the Innocent attempt to pitifully knife you!tl;dr fun social game with fair gameplay elements"

Each play through is different.The few set backs I have with it.1. Getting paired with non- english speakers. Since this game is all about communication it simply ruins the playability.2. Full blood for one kill. (the original version you could be transformed the whole night with 2 blood packs. Now you need 3, and once you kill one person it starts to drain. Which I understand why they implemented this, but hindering the demons so harshly makes it super difficult for them to be able to kill off the survivors. One survivor goes down, he gets antidoted back up. Well since we're on floor 2, we've had 1-3 scanners which means high probability the infected has been found. It's too many odds against the infected. It makes it super hard3. The community can be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes friends will down you or just execute you simply because you're not in their ""group"" they did limit the party sizes to prevent this from happening, but it's  still difficult to handle.Overall it's a great game, especially for the price tag. The devs have an active discord channel and they seem interested in making this game great and keeping it that way. I would invest the money into it for sure.

Also you lose ALL your blood when somebody downs you, items included. After they find out your name when you are infected, its pretty much over because they will keep shooting u down and there is nothing u can do because you will keep losing blood and u can't collect enough while being chased to even transform and execute them which needs SIX BLOOD PACKS, SIX, A WHOLE LEVEL's WORTH. If that wasn't enough, you need to race against your terror buddy to collect enough blood to just transform. On the first level, only one terror can transform because there isnt enough blood for both of you to do it. All the while you have to be descrete doing it. If that wasn't enough, the devs also added fuses to decrease blackout timer, decreased terror speed and traps that can pretty much down terrors in one go. Combine this with the bunch of Chinese, Russian population and Autistic 12 year olds and u have a great terror buddy to play with. If you think its any better as a survivor then you are wrong. Public games will lack any sense of coordination, and people will take matters into their own hands and shoot people that they want to shoot.

By watching others' actions and listening to their statements, you try to figure out which two of the six person group are infected.

When the lights come back on, they are forced back in to human form.You can shoot, knife, and down everyone including players that are not infected.

76561198044440331,Recommended,466240,31833359,Posted: 18 May,all,Mirage,"This game plays out like a fast paced murder mystery.  You can’t trust anyone and have to use the information you gain during the game to determine who is innocent and who is infected.  This includes who picks up what items, who scans who with the scanner, and who just ran out of the room where you see missing blood packs….  I've already purchased this game for 4 of my friends, and will probably continue to buy it for people.General thoughts - Shooting seems ""off"" to me.  Having played a ton of shooters in the past, I don't feel like the gun play is on the level of a Battlegrounds, a CS:GO, or even an H1Z1.  This recent patch seems to have tightened this up a bit though.  Also the new knife mechanics feel familiar and strong in game.Pros - Matchmaking attempts to put you with similarly ranked players, but I feel like we don't have a large enough player base yet.  I'm hoping we can change that!  If you can get by the learning curve, this game has everything you could possibly want in a survival horror / whodunit.  The game shines even brighter with a group of friends.    Please feel free to contact me if you’d like to discuss the game in depth.  I’m a huge evangelist of this game, so reach out to me!Cons - To me, the main downside right now is playing with people that haven't given the game enough of a chance.  This is reflected in a lot of the negative reviews.  If you check them, they’re typically from people with less than 50 hours played.  Everyone that has played 50+ hours has been through getting stomped by higher level ELO players, getting a partner as the infected that doesn’t know quite what to do yet, etc.  If you can get through that and embrace the game for what it is, you'll have a great time."

So left the letters as I'm able to.I've concerned about reviewing the game for a long time and finally made the decision to do it now(maybe because my poor Eng). Have much to say.I followed it since it's released and then have the game of my own on 16th June, the end of the senior high school entrance examination and was a Noobly at once. Not long after that, I found it a pleasure and fun to ""deceit"" in a game that's so exciting even though bad skills' the only thing I had. Deceit's not about losing friend, it's about make you and your friend working and thinking togeher, knowing more about'em and having fun. There're many English speakers and Chinese Sprakers(even some Russian guys and the ones from Korea, Japan) I've met and make friend with. These hours're a lot of work.From official banning players for no real-existing reason, 5th July's big update, devide servers into Europe,american and Asia then every language to the community update ""'Friday the 13th of Oct' it'll be free to play"" now, it did lost many players.

My FPS had dropped tremendously, making the game unplayable. I first thought it was my computer. I restarted my computer & that didn't work. I went to the forums looking to see if this is a similar issue amongst users & found out that it is. I used to be able to run it fairly smoothly with the quality on low for everything. Now, with everything on low, my computer runs at about 5-15 FPS.Granted my computer isn't some high-end gaming desktop, it's a low-end gaming laptop, but I still have little issue with other games.

I just started the game, and my first match was with people below level 5, at least 3 of them, really game? And for those of you who don't know, the game does not have any kind standard or ranked game modes, it's only ranked, starting from 20 (low) going down to 1(high).

Voice communication is pretty much a must to enjoy the game to its full potential & finding multiplayer matches is relatively quick. 6 survivors and 2 are infected, but who? The real fun comes from the intuitive ways you can kill the innocent as the infected & the suspense of not knowing who's infected, which can make for some interesting communication among eachother.Although I do get quite a few frame drops/crashes on my gtx 1070/i7 6700k, it's still enjoyable and well worth the 15$ I spent on it (about the same as a bucket of KFC Chicken). If you have a low end computer I DO NOT recommend this game in its current state. It simply isn't optimized enough.

,Not Recommended,466240,30383642,Posted: 7 March,all,Darkcast,"This game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible with worse choices than Dead By Daylight.pros:Cool conceptCons:1. Boring as hell.  If both infected die or leave near the start of the game it's literally just 5 minutes of running to the exit.2. TERRIBLE trait system.  First you have to level up to obtain the ABILITY to get the trait.  Then you have to complete a ridiculous challenge to actually unlock the trait.  WTF DESIGN CHOICE IS THIS!3. Ridiculously overpowered traits.  Again this goes back to traits being absolute garbage.  One character for example has a trait that gives him 10 more camera uses per camera.  His third level trait gives him a camera.  A camera can be used approximately 6 times normally so he instantly has 16 off the bat.  God forbid he picks up a second camera he has 30 uses.  The camera stuns the monster preventing him from moving.  You can literally stun lock the infected forever with 2 cameras and this trait.  WTF?!4. You can't kill the infected when they're transformed.  Another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design flaw.  Your bullets won't kill the monster they'll only stun him.  Meaning you have to shot, run away, shoot run away, and hope you can stun him long enough until the power comes back on and he transforms.  Run out of ammo? well that monster is going to catch you and one hit kill you.  Guns can only be used to kill people in human form.  Who is designing this game?5.  Are you infected?  Want to drink that blood bag? Don't have the trait? Well then they're going to hear it from literally the other side of the map.  Who cares if no one sees you.  They're going to hear it and you're ♥♥♥♥ed.6.  Terrible matchmaking.  This is the SAME issue that Dead By Daylight has.  New player, level 1 (or in this game rank 20 because it counts down for god knows what reason) with 0 traits WILL be matched up with people who are top ranked and have all the traits.  As the infected he stands no chance.  As a survivor he's basically just along for the ride and won't do much.  Unfun terrible design choice.  How hard is it to put a proper matchmaking system in.7. BUGS! OH BOY THE BUGS! It would at least be one thing if this game was in early access.  However it's not.  this is a FULL RELEASE!  Did they even playtest this before putting it on steam. Some of the bugs I encounted within less than 2 hours of playing:RIGHT off the back I had issues with this game not hiding my mouse cursor.  I had to relaunch the game 6 times to finally get it to hide the windows cursor.If you're infected and want to use the in game text chat to speak to the other infected you you'll actually be speaking in all chat.  That's right, even though when you push the chat button it reads ""infected chat"" you're not actually in infected chat you're in all chat.  To get to infected chat you have to hit the tab button before you're actually in infected chat.  HOW DOES THIS SLIP THROUGH PLAYTESTING?!Infected can sometimes become unkillable in human form.  My buddy was infected, he transformed back into a human, was shot into a downed state but instead of going down he froze in place, we shot to vote to eliminate him, but the shots didn't register.  He respawned, we tried again, the shots stopped registering.  So now we've got infected who just can't die at all.8. EXTREMELY repetitive gameplay.  There's only two levels and besides the environment they're EXACTLY the same.  There's no different items between levels, there's nothing that changes.  It's just a different look and it doesn't effect how you play the game.   Might as well just changed the paint on the wall of the first level and called it a second level.  The gameplay gets repetitive and stale extremely quickly.9. Getting blood for blood bags is pretty much useless.  Why? Well blood gives you power but there's only 3 floors and on floor three during the blackout the infected get full power and retains full power after exections.  Meaning the strategy is to actually help the party until floor 3, your team offs an innocent by mistake, and then use the full power you get to transform, camp the escape lever, and kill everyone.  There's no deception besides not getting caught until then.  No trying to turn the party on each other, no trying to get people to kill innocents, it's literally help quietly until the end, camp the lever that opens the escape door, and kill them as they come because you're unkillable when you're transformed.  Why bother getting blood and transforming on floor 1 or 2 for some kills when you risk getting caught?  There's no benefit to it.  Another terrible design flaw.10. Short levels.  Again with levels only being 3 floors you only have three blackouts to kill everyone.  Why are the levels so short?  With the level length you've got about a minute and 30 of blackouts and another minute and 30 of time to do objectives.  Meaning the longest the game is ever going to be is about 3 minutes.  For a game about lying and deceit that's an aweful short game.11.  15 dollars for this?! This is a 5 dollar game AT MOST and that's if 90% of these issues didn't exist.I played this for 8 minutes shy of the two hour mark on stream and requested a refund. AVOID THIS GAME."

This game kind of reminds me of an old Starcraft custom called Mafia. The game is as deep and as intricate as you and the people that you are playing it with make it. Making it into the next round after turning and eating someone and having the rest of the players not know that it was you? One of the best feelings. There absolutey is a community that plays this game. The VAST majority of the community is an absolute treat to play with, funny ♥♥♥♥ers. I would say that this game has a decent sized learning curve and one of the negatives I think is that newer players are going to get into games and you are going to lose, a lot. Until you start to get the hang of it and understand not everyone sees what you see, not everyone knows what you know. You gotta do what you can to convice people to your side whether you are lying or telling the truth for your best chance at winning in my opinion. The devs update the game and change things pretty regularly it seems to me which completely changes the game. For example, downing people during the day time used to give infected players blood which is needed to eliminate innocent players, it doesn't at the moment. If you were relying on that before you have to completely change your strategy now. There are some minor glitches in the game as well, they sometimes can get a little frustrating but has never taken away from the experience for me. I would reccomend this game to anyone. It truly is amazing. Falls under maybe the best $15 I have spent? I am not that good, but if you are a new player or are interested in getting into the game you for sure can add me and I will share the things that I do know with you to get you winning some games. Come let me hear your beautiful voices, lets argue :)Assygrin"

And no, being unable to play with your 5 other friends in a party online is just absurd there is an obvious reason this is implemented.

,Recommended,466240,31707399,Posted: 12 May,all,Shihamut,"I'm not going to tell you what this game isn't or what it could be, I'm just here to let you know what it currently is and what it's like with a party of close IRL friends. You will question your sanity. You will second guess what you know about people. Hell, you may even come to realize your friends could lie themselves out of murder charges (okay, maybe not this one).Deceit is a game that relies almost entirely on your ability to keep calm and lie your way to the finish line. Nobody is to be trusted, even if the burden of proof seems too good to be true. Think you saw someone drink a blood bag? Is someone looking suspicious hiding in a corner all alone? Are you 110% certain all the infected were dealt with nice and early? My dear readers you could be, and will be, DEAD wrong.This game throws back to the classic Trouble in Terrorist town, some have even compared it to Secret Hitler or Mafia. Of the 6 people in-game, 2 of them are randomly infected and will do ANYTHING it takes to get the remaining 4 innocents to turn on each other. Whether it be through calculated planning or full on mayhem and confusion, it's all about the mind-games. There is no ""winning"" strategy, there is no ""meta"" that everyone follows to win, it's all about how well you can convince other people to listen to you whether infected or not. If congressmen played this game you wouldn't even stand a fraction of a chance.Between all the items and fool-proof ways to determine who is innocent or infected, there is an equal amount of psychological warfare happening at all times. Take the inspector kit for example, it will tell you with 100% accuracy the nature of the person you are scanning. You might be thinking ""hey, I could just scan Bob over here, and tell the group if this dude is infected and we're already 1 step ahead right? RIGHT!?""Wrong. Bob has a darker plan in mind, he says you are lying out of your♥♥♥♥♥and defaults the blame saying YOU are the infected one. Who's to be trusted in this situation? Do they kill Bob possibly putting down one of the infected? Or do they start to believe you ARE really infected, and they chance to take you out and make their lives easier?What about if one of the infected persons scans the OTHER infected persons and calls him clean, can you believe with 100% certainty that neither of them are lying? The simple answer is: you can't trust ANYONE without seeing the proof yourself.At the end of it all, it doesn't matter how skilled you are with a gun or how well you know the maps to be able to loot up faster than anyone. If you just don't have the ability to lie yourself out of trouble, you will not escape/kill your victims. This alone adds a nearly infinite amount of replayability, as no 2 minds think alike and people you ""think"" are on the same wavelength as you can completely deceive you and eat your face off in a dark room with nobody to hear you screaming.So I'll ask you now; Do you think you have what it takes your lie your way to the finish line? The answer just might surprise (or eat) you."

,Recommended,466240,31122315,Posted: 13 April,all,Chesturr,"Deceit is a game that is simple in concept, but somewhat brilliant in execution.The premise is as follows: you and a group of five others (six in total) have been kidnapped by a mad scientist who has a strange liking for rabbits (come to think of it, I vaugely remember him bieng called Dr. Hare). The doctor has injected two of you with his serum, and then you all have to escape from the forest or asylum (it's updating as I write this, so there may be a new map, I'm not too sure).So as afar as gameplay goes, you wake up in a random spot in the first section of the map, and you have about a minute until it goes dark. In this time, you can run aroundand activate levers which let you complete objectives. These range from simple 'stand in the circle for a few seconds' to the still simple 'shoot three spinning targets'. These grant you rewards, such as a camera, tracker, antidote, and a scanner. When night time hits, you huddle together, and wait for daytime. The length of the night, or blackout, is determined by how many items you got, as well as the length of the daytime. You keep doing this through three section: in the last section, one lever activates the escape hatch; you open it, then, as the name suggests, escape. Game over.And yet that would be boring, so clearly some nasties were added in. Two players are infected: you don't know who, and you can't immediately tell, not unless they're foolish anyways. Terrors have the goal of stopping the innocent (non-terrors) from escaping. They can do this ina  number of ways, but the two obvious ones are taking/stealing good items, or killing players. The terrors have something called 'Terror Strength', which they can fill by downing an innocent, or drinking blood (those are the main ways anyway). However, if you want to stay alive, you can't just go around and drink the blood like it's water and down people like it's a sport (which, let's face it, it is). Instead, you have to be sneaky. You have to drink the blood on the sly, and blame it on someone else (preferably an innocent), or use items to your advantage. One item is the scanner: whne used it tells whoever is holding it if the scannee is infected or innocent (one time use though). It's up to the group to decide if they're lying, or telling the truth. The terrors have the real power during night time, when they can unleash their inner Freddy Krueger and execute the innocents, provided they have the strength to do so. Strength is depleted when you execute, so you have to be smart.Anyways, that's the basics, there's a bit more too it, but you gotta play the game. The community is nice, apart from the odd idiot, and very dedicated. Don't let the low player count fool you. Anyways, I totally recommend this game: it's a little bit buggy sometimes, but the Dev's work hard, and it truly shows.EDIT: The game has changed a bit since I wrote this, but about 3/4 months later, the above still applies. However, while this is what I would envision as a perfect game, the player count is rather low... while I have little to no issues finding match, finding a match with even one person who can speak English/is willing to speak can be a challenge. As for queuing for competetive? Not happening, it takes too long."

If you do not communicate in voicechat people will suspect you and take you down without hesitation.Developers have been great so far, having set up a Discord server where the devteam, founders, moderators and community moderators are online most of the time, actually replying to the chat, they don't hide from anything which is a good thing nowadays.I would have given this game a solid 85/100 if the game was priced 30EUR.

The graphics are reasonably good, and the concept of it is great. I could see me buying this game for £15-20, not £7!Deceit is a game about 6 survivors who wake up. Two of them have contracted a disease that makes them thirsty for blood. The two infected have to work together to kill the other four innocent players. They can achieve this by drinking blood bags to fill their ""blood meter"". Once their blood meter is full, they can transform into a ""terror"" - a terrifying monster that can kill survivors in one hit if they don't have armor.Every minute or so, a blackout will happen, when the infected can transform into their terrifying forms, and the most dreaded phase for the innocents. They can either survive for about a minute before the power comes back online anyway, or find 2-3 fuses to set the timer to ten seconds.Deceit is a game about deceiving others if you are the infected, and knowing whether or not you can trust your ""teammates"" around you. In this game, you cannot trust anyone.Sometimes the matches can become repetitive, though. But I guess that would apply to basically every single game with a multiplier mode.Overall, great game, and would recommend it to everyone! :)"

It is very strategic for example if there are the last 3 pepole with you during the second night and one is missing you would assume the infected would be the missing person drinking blood/destroying levers during the night so as long as you play it correctly acting oblivious to the situation by lieing. Or simply accusing someone else that the group of innocents were not with of doing suspect things such as drinking blood, not being with the group. Anything that will deter the attention of the group away from you onto another player. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for a strategic or action game as you are always on your toes on the look out for whos infected."

76561197970256414,Recommended,466240,31755619,Posted: 14 May,all,GentlemanGreen,"Edit:I have played this game for another 5 hours and I've decided to change my review to recommended (even though the problems I mentioned in the review still exist). All the game breaking bugs have workarounds, and I'll admit I'm having a blast playing this game.Thanks to the devs for replying to my review, I can see you guys are working hard on the game and hopefully all the current problems will get fixed soon.As for the report system, I highly suggest you guys also implement put a report button at the end of the game, which is the norm in most competitive multiplayer games, I'll admit I didn't even notice it in my first 4 hours of gameplay.I honestly believe you should release a solo queue mode for a competitive. Queuing with friends is fun, but you never know what information they might share with each other, even with a party of 2 people, ""harsh party size restrictions"" sounds shady to me. Right now, you can queue as 3, but even a party of 2 people can share information that can break the game. I'm sure most people who play this game a lot would agree. (to be fair, solo queue could also hypothetically have 2 players or more could queue at the same time and most likely end up in the same game, but still, I still feel it'd be better for the game). I've only encountered point farming party twice, so fortunately it's not something that you see often. But hopefully you guys consider doing a solo queue only mode.Also please fix the map with snowstorms inbetween buildings, there are so many bugs with this map (missing door on the first stage, glitch when opening the exit door, floor with no collision on the 2nd floor) it's driving me nuts.-----------------------------------------Well apparently I can't refund this game after 3.9 hours.Let me start off by saying that this game is fun, I've had fun for the first 1-2 hours, but then problems starting popping up, and fairly serious problems for a game that is NOT in early access, so I unfortunately can't recommend this game.***If you are the developer or a player considering buying this game, I highly suggest you read my bad section before you do.***Good-------------Super fun werewolf kind of game, definitely a blast when playing with friends, or the right group of strangers-Items found around the map are fun-Character traits are pretty cool, the leveling curve seems just about right-The 3 room mechanic flow feels very good, not too rushed, but not too easy either-Meet people from all around the world (I had a girl from Korea, a girl from Denmark, a Russian guy, a Chinese guy, me (Canadian)Bad-------------No solo queue/no report systemMeeting the right group of strangers is fun, but meet a 3-man premade that is farming points and it gets REALLY bad really quick. If you aren't aware, a game has 6 players, 4 innocents and 2 terrors, terrors must kill the innocents and innocents must escape the map/find the terrors and vote them out. To my knowledge you used to be able to queue as 4 and 5, but obviously this brings a lot of problems where people would just bully/kill the 1-2 pug players.If I lost you, let me give you an in-game situation that happened to me while playing yesterday.I was the terror with another guy, he told me he had 2 innocent friends with us in the same game, all I had to do was follow him and do as I was told. they shot one of the innocents (you need 4 votes to vote someone out in the first room) so even though I knew what they were doing, I also wanted to win, so I just voted the innocent guy out, we then voted the other innocent guy out, and then proceeded to farm point for the remaining of the game while the 2 other guys were watching us. At the end of the game they were pretty angry (I was too...), I wanted to report them but there are not report feature implemented.Which brings me to my points: 3 man queue is just as bad as 4 and 5 if played right, and unfortunately makes the experience a lot less fun (even if I was on the winning side). You can't expect everyone to behave according to the game rules, which has to be expected when you are designing this kind of asymmetrical game. Solution? I think the best solution should be to have 3 different queues. Let me explain:Competitive1- Solo queue, you understand are aware that when you are queueing for solo queue, you will not be in discord with other players, and any unfair/farming behaviour is reportable.2- Team queue, where teams of 2 can queue together, and are matched with other teams of 2, any unfair/farming behaviour is reportablePublic3- Team queue, any number of players (1-2-3-4-5-6) can join, and no behaviour is enforced, you always risk running into people who will sandbag you/kill you, but at least you can still queue up with your friends if you want too. Although for obvious reasons you can't be allowed in the competitive mode.I'm not sure if there is a big enough player pool to implement these queues, but the following solution fixes all bad reviews this game currently has (people complaining about premades, people complaining about not being able to queue with friends). For this to work as I mentioned, we need a report function and have the community/ops guy review the reports.-Stability (crashes, freezes, lagouts)I can't really provide any suggestions for this one, but I've had a lot of them in 4 hours of gameplay, way too many for a game that isn't in early access. To give you an idea, I've lagged out 5 times (the whole lobby lagged out, not just me, I didn't notice if my rank went down as I was just trying to have fun), crashed twice, and froze 3 times at random locations.-BugsI'm pretty sure there are more, but I've come accross 2 game breaking bugs that can be extremely frustrating1. There is an exit door on one of the maps, once your open the door, you get thrown out of the map,you can't do anything and must wait for the game to finish on its own (you still lose)2. There is a floor on the second floor on one of the maps that has no collision, if you walk on it, you fall off the map, with the same consequences as bug #1.Conclusion------------If you are a group of 6 players thinking about getting this game, do it, you'll have a blast! Otherwise, I think I would wait and see if these problems gets fixed.Vote for developers: I will change my rating to positive if a competitive/solo queue mode and a report function gets implemented, I don't mind dealing with lagouts/crashes/freezes from time to time, but if I can't even have a fair gaming environment when the game actually works, I'd rather not recommend this game to potential customers."

But  this is a style all its own.Same premise as others, survivors must do what they can to escape and survive. There are two infected (monsters) that will have a moment during the blackout to kill you. It is a game of lies and deceit to win the game. But it is very fast paced and it could take about 7-10 min to play one match.You will have little goodies and tools to help you kill or find out the truth about a person. Scanners that will tell you if a player is infected, poison that will insta kill the monster, cameras that will flash light to stun the monsters, etc.The game is fun. Not too scary unless you're truly alone in a dark hallway and you hear the transformation of one of the humans into a monster. But if you are alone like that, you deserve to die.Very much worth it. I'd recommend for those looking for a game they can pass the time with while waiting for the cup of Ramen in the microwave."

I'm talking about half the games that you play will end in you crashing. This is especially frustrating when you are the Infected. If your Infected teammate crashes early on in the game it almost definitely equals a loss for you as it is near impossible to win a game as an Infected with only one teammate and 4 Innocents. The ranking system is also hindered by the amount of crashes in Deceit. Every time you lose, disconnect, or crash you lose one rank point - even if you're about to win. This makes it very tedious to rank up, and discourages you to play. Deceit has a very good concept, contains great mechanics, and the players are very nice, but as of right now, I can not recommend this game to anyone that criticizes bugs and glitches - I personally am very lenient on bugs but this is too much. If Automaton does fix the crashes and the bugs, I would definitely recommend this game."

In the almost 2 hours spent on the game I have been able to play 1 game.

Spent 30 minutes waiting for a queue when we had 3 people, so half a lobby, and still couldn't find anyone. Finally, we joined their discord and found people to play with the next day and queued up, we were really excited to finally play. Got 2 dud lobbies that we had to back out of and regroup just to get in the game. Then we got thrown in the game, no explanation as to how to play, and I died within seconds. Tried it again, survived but found out there was a time limit so we lost. 3rd time was the charm, oh wait, my game crashed then several other players had their games crashed aaaaand we were forced to restart our computers.At this point in time, I have no desire to play this game again. With a huge lack in players, the wait time for a lobby is ridiculous and requires the use of their discord just to find others. Their servers need some work as we encountered dead lobbies and a few crashes. I play a lot of games like this and have waited out the bugs but this game just wasn't worth it for me.I wish that in the future, more people play it and the devs are able to fix the game and add a tutorial."

Know what I'm saying!? anyways...Apart from that, I have mixed feelings with this game.The concept is fun & kind of unique & people on VOIP really do get into the ""deceit"" part.Which makes it very amusing & gives you that precautious & deceptive vibe even more.The moment the lights go off are really full of groping & anxiety attacks... which is good... right...On the other hand.I think the world record for Mario Bros is 5min. or so,... anyways it does seem to take longer than completing a map.The maps are as small as my... well... you get the picture...It takes away the fun imo, cause as soon as you're done, you're like ""wait, what... that's it!?"".They really need to do something about that... no seriously...I can't say Aye,But I wont say No either...Conclusion:If it's daddy's money... go for it!If not... do so at your own risk."

I almost didn't purchase it for that very reason BUT I'M GLAD I DIDN'T LISTEN! As a huge fan of the multiplayer-horror-survival titles this game has lived up to all expectations. Are there bugs? Yes. Is there lag? Yes. But the developers have brought something new to the table where you are up against 5 other human players who you have to decide are worth trusting, or killing. The only problem is killing the wrong player can put the survivors at a real disadvantage. So you have to listen to the lies, use the devices in the game to help determine who the baddies really are and kill them before it's to late.This game will no doubt be optimized and bugs will be fixed.

Getting voted out with a bunch of rank 20s being dumb when ur innocent causes u to lose 20-25 ranked points and when you win its around 8-9

Everybody uses a mic, which is great. The game is still in early development (I hope this isn't the full release, at least) i think I've noticed 3 different maps so far, on the maps you find items like scanners, cameras, trackers, a shotgun, and possibly an antidote to help your friend who has been downed. You will end up playing with players you have played with before as the playerbase isn't that big. You can unlock new hairstyles, clothes, gun/knife skins through leveling up and opening a chest, though they say this will be changing soon. The matches aren't too long, and they aren't too short I think they last between 5-10 minutes. Love the game though, and the community seems pretty funny/friendly for the most part. I'd definitely give the game a try."

You'll be attacked, accused and sworn at one second, then the game will end and everyone will be laughing and chatting away like good friends. I also hardly ever end up in games with people who don't speak English or who don't speak at all, despite what a some of the reviews said. It does happen, but it's no where near as big a deal as it's made out to be.I have experienced only a few crashes and bugs, mainly when loading into games/in the main menu, and the devs seem to update the game daily so they're actively working on everything that's wrong with it. Games are also normally found pretty much instantly.You'll find you play with the same people a lot, but I'd say this adds to the game if anything. I find the game most fun when playing with an about even mix of both friends and randies.The only real downside is that there's only a couple of maps, so you will play the same maps over and over, which could perhaps get repetitive in a game where the rounds only last around 5 mins. But this doesn't really take too much away from the game experience, and I imagine they have plans to introduce more maps in the near future.My favourite purchase of 2017, alongside Dead by Daylight."
,Recommended,466240,30617925,Posted: 19 March,all,Asyrex2k,"So, let me start with this: I know I do not have that many hours, however I think I can give some of my opinions to you.Ok so firstly, this game is F*CKING AWESOME. Not only that it can be kinda scary on the asylum map, but you also have to pay attention to other players and plan your moves carefully. This game is all about trust and atention. If you are an infected, you have to build up trust by helping other players and trying to get them one by one. If that is not your approach tho, then you can use brutal strenght and go ham on the 4 survivors if you are next to the other infected. However, if you are an innocent guy, then you have many ways of playing this game. You can always be the guy who is alone, trying to get all the objective for himself and not trust anyone. You can be the guy that helps everyone and tries to stay together all the time, or you can be the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who uses the lethal on a guy before finishing the round :^). There are just so many ways to play this game, every game brings something new, you are NEVER gonna do the same things over and over again, the objectives are different, the maps are different (even tho there are only 2 maps so far) and most of the time the players aren't gonna be the same!Now I'm just gonna give you some pros and cons if you dont want to read this whole thing:PROS:-Customizable characters, each of them having their own perks and costumes.-Lot's of items (objectives)-Good shooting system-Well designed maps-Searching for players takes like 5 seconds-Good ranking system-Nice graphics-Voice chat-And many more!CONS:-Lot's of crashes, like seriously, lots!-This game is not very optimised, i have GTX 970 and i7 4790 and i still have lag in some parts of the maps.-Only 1 gamemode so far-You can not use in-game currency yet-Cameras are too OP against monsters, if you have a camera and you know how to use it, the monster will never get you-More crashing-Random visual bugsSo, in conclusion, I can definetly that this game is worth a buy, however if you hate bugs, crashes and poor performance from time to time, wait a couple of weeks until they release a new patch!"

For example dead by daylight didn't do so well in my opinion. I have only played for a short amount of time and i will update my review later but so far this game is amazing my heart was pounding most of my matches. The game brings horror to a new level and not knowing who is the infected or being the infected and trying not to be too suspicious is a lot of fun.

Specifically more maps. And could do with more weapons. But the weapon aspect is currently debatable. As it stands presently, the weapon system is balanced and getting an edge needs some team work which I approve of.3). Once the game acquires a large player base, it should offer language-based server settings.Is this game fun to play? Yes. Do you get bored quickly? Yes.

This game is a horror multiplayer fps nightmare like it says it wake up in a asylum,forest,old military wound barracks who doesn't want that? And then either escape,get eaten, or lose and see that everyone who won is dabbing as Rachael how fun.being honest people who say ""this is dead"" or ""it fuc**ng sucks"" are salty at getting beat cause as kids they think everything has to go their way aka buy this game"

I have seen it's on cryengine so FPS would be fine so far on this engine but urgh, the game has alot of FPS shuttering, it's not newbies friendly and has alot of copycate of 13 friday night or however the game called. Not gonna recommend it due to it's FPS issues."

76561198070620776,Not Recommended,466240,30901981,Posted: 2 April,all,Karma LOL,I originally reviewed this game very well and reccomended it but i have to re-review. It seems like every patch they partially fix a glitch and 5 more are added. This game crashes more than any game ive ever played and when you crash you lose elo. when someone disconnects and it becomes a 5 man game instead of a 6 man there will either be 1 infected vs 4 humans UNFAIR or 2 infected vs 3 human UNFAIR.. the fact thaty there is no different ques for solo or group single handedly destroys the ranking climb because teammates will tell whoever they want to boost who their infected partner is.. ppl also troll at the end of the game even if theyre 100 percent certain all the infected are dead they will have a friend help them grab lethal injection and kill you just to be a troll.. I gave theis game a shot and i will probably continue to play it until i get payed and buy player unknowns battlegrounds. 2/5 rating at best from me.
,Not Recommended,466240,34785466,Posted: 6 September,all,Dwight Knight,"Sounded like an interesting game and I love Dead by Daylight, so I figured I'd give this a whirl.  Sadly it is not.  I rarely am able to actually load into a game, and even when I do all I manage to get is a bunch of non-English players with whom I cannot even begin to coordinate.I've yet to actually *be* an infected, but with the exception of one time have managed to get shot right out of the gate as an infected by rando rambos.Add that the devs don't even care to put the patch notes in English and it's a hard pass.  I only wish I'd been able to get a refund for this game when I had the chance."

,Not Recommended,466240,34567241,Posted: 28 August,all,LEONTONER,I absolutely love the concept for this game it has a great twist on the Murder Mystery theme. The game makes sense after just a few games. It's easy to go along with. Fun to winBUT there is NOBODY playing this game I checked again today 50 total players in the US servers and 0 on every other server. This game needs to go for free for a week and have some major spotlight action or it'll just be another $10 paperweight of a game

,Recommended,466240,34728972,Posted: 3 September,all,Pooter,"Fun concept, game has its bugs and isn't perfect by far, but the lack of a population on the game makes english servers main for all languages. Communication being an important in the games fun factor can make random seached matches a mixed bag. Would recomend to play with a group of friends. 6 players total making a lobby."

You try to figure out who is infected or try not to be discovered that you are....you lie to your friends and then murder them!! The community for this game is awesome and the idea is great!!....just not enough people playing it. Pay the $10, get infected, then murder your friends or strangers!! What else could you want?"
,Recommended,466240,35253005,Posted: 27 September,all,Lord Gary Braun,"I call this game the ALT F4 special because those are my most used button combinations when playing this game. Anyone that plays this game can push ALT F4 in less than .00000003 seconds if the terror is nearby. If someone transforms into a terror while standing next to you, it is hononrable to press ALT F4. My other favorite part of this game is when you're innocent, being accused of being a terror, agree to be scanned, agree to be downed to lose your blood (even though you're not a terror) and then voted out. So you then ALT F4. This game revolves around who can ALT F4 faster. Help me."
