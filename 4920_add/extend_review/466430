76561198148236677,Recommended,466430,23495086,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,The Amazing Dark,"This game was shorter than I would have liked, but I suppose it would have been a Herculean effort to try to cover the amount of time this story does with a longer length. From the author of Choice of Robots, who similarly visited the subject of philosophy in that installment, now brings it to focus in the forefront in this interactive novel. Being both a mild layman to philosophy as well as deeply interested in it, I was very pleased with the premise of this game and was not disappointed in it.As short as it is, there's a large variety of different things you can focus on, from the genius focused on doing what's best for everyone to a conniving manipulator looking for power. So far I've found tutoring the prince to be the wisest and most selfless ruler possible to be the most interesting, but I'm undoubtedly going to explore the other avenues of this game on future plays.This is probably the best example of ""a thinking gamer's"" interactive novel from Choice of Games, and it bears the distinction of being just as cerebral as it is entertaining. I've gone on three different runs now (offline and online, explaining my short time on it) second-guessing myself on how I could get what I believed to be the ""best ending"", and each time I find new pieces of the puzzle I hadn't even considered before.Highly recommended, especially for the incredibly low price it's being discounted at in it's early release."
76561198136739534,Recommended,466430,23600641,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,"hkiss02, am not dead","Just like Choice of Robots, the other interactive novel by Kevin Gold, Choice of Alexandria is a bit short; but it more than makes up for it with impactful decisions and a few emotional moments. A ""choose your own adventure"" type game, Choice of Alexandria heavily revolves around your decisions, and, just like Choice of Robots, your decisions have a massive impact on the game, even changing the final chapter completely.As a philosopher in ancient Alexandria, you are tasked with raising the future ruler of Egypt. How you teach him is up to you, and you do feel connected to the young prince, at least in my experience. I became very dissappointed when the prince did not turn out how I wanted him to. Additionally, the setting of ancient Egypt is very unique when compared to many other Choice of Games titles, which are usually either a low-fantasy world or superhero-themed. At the very least, very few, if any, are set in ancient times, and have the player take the role of a primitive scientist.Despite it's brevity, Choice of Alexandria is still a memorable interactive novel, and while I still prefer Choice of Robots, people who enjoyed that title are likely going to love Choice of Alexandria due to them having the same author and having impactful decisions in each of the titles. Overall, 8/10."
76561198075673573,Recommended,466430,30523395,Posted: 15 March,all,wrygrass,"I rate the game, Choice of Alexandria 4/5. Good.This is one of the absolute best, most thought-provoking choose-your-own adventure style text-based games I have ever read/played. Its emphasis on philosophy and the potential long-term consequences of your choices (and the potential endings which result) are extremely interesting and fairly well written. The characters are more complex and the various messages and themes are far deeper than much of the intellectual content found in most graphically intense games which have yet been created. The ethical dilemmas this game presents can be extremely difficult and the results of your actions, while not always easy to predict, make perfect sense in hindsight.Unlike Champion of the Gods, the genre of this story is not fantasy but alternate history (a somewhat unusual form of sci-fi). This story/game attempts to answer questions of what might have been had people made different decisions to bring about alternate events. What if the great library of Alexandria had not burnt down or fallen into disrepair? What if wisdom from the ancient world had not been largely lost? What if the Alexandrian Empire had been successful in competing against Rome and had lasted for much, much longer? The choices you make in this game will help setup (or destroy) these potential alternate histories. This game explains how the petty or selfless actions of someone in a position of authority can, in a tenuous situation, help cause the vast potential of the future to be destroyed or created.This game will also more obviously delve into how your decisions as a tutor to a royal heir may cause him to either become a great ruler or a vain despot or perhaps, something in between. Moreover, this game also attempts to answer the question as to exactly why providing people with a good education and access to knowledge is important to the longevity and survival of a civilization combined with the vital role that certain, sometimes seemingly minor technological inventions and scientific discoveries can play in the shaping of the unknown future. Seamlessly integrated into all this are important messages about the absolute necessity of maintaining balance and fairness among the people, even the very poor and those of another race, (messages which some of us, in our modern civilization seem to actively refuse to comprehend) if a civilization is to have a chance of thriving.Unfortunately, Choice of Alexandria suffers from the same basic failings as most other games of this type. Unlike in a real book, there is no Back button to go back to a previous page or to undue a previous decision so you can easily see an alternate plot. This is extremely frustrating if you want to easily or quickly see the full potential which this game has to offer and track multiple potential timelines simultaneously. In essence, the interface lacks flexibility. While the descriptions and writing is at least adequate for the most part it does tend to be a bit dry and tends to be lacking the visceral detail which many actual novels would possess. You get to read very little of your character's personal life nor do you get a clear idea of what it was like to actually live in the distant past. You almost never get to read about what your character's living arrangements are like for example. You don't get to hear how he/she bathes, how he/she eats how he/she sleeps etc. There's so little written on your character's quality of life that your character seems like a lifeless, 2-dimensional, cardboard mask for you to wear while you make occasional menu choices. He/She doesn't hardly seem to live, or breathe or sweat or ache.So, In short:+Great choices, meaningful endings, philosophically deep, interesting alternate histories, good character motivations, reasonably logical results due to your choices. Important messages and themes. Socially and intellectual important content throughout. Thought provoking. Deals with issues relevant to the real world. Far more intellectually involved and deep than most high-graphics games which have ever existed.-Inflexible interface doesn't let you go back to a previous page or to a previous decision to easily see what else might have happened if you chose differently causing you to have to play the whole game over again if you want to see the differences caused by choosing any other choice. Somewhat dry writing style featuring little visceral or sensory detail and next to no information about what it might be like to live, from day to day as an Alexandrian royal tutor. Sometimes, seems like less of a true novel and more like pages and pages of interlocking introductions to various menu choices which makes main character seem like a mere interface through which you can make decisions rather than a living, breathing person. The first play through provides the most emotional involvement if you decide to try to seriously make the choices you think you would make in the same situation. Emotional involvement with the story tends to decrease during subsequent play throughs."
76561198016958184,Recommended,466430,23554455,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,sphere720,"As the author's follow up to Choice of Robots, which was one of the better productions from Choice of Games, I have been anticipating playing this game for some time.  After playing it multiple times, I can say that I was not disappointed.  It is a very accurate representation of the Hellenistic era, which is sadly an era of world history that tends to be largely glossed over.  You play as a philospher who comes to Alexandria to advance their own studies and to serve as a tutor to the future heir to the Ptolemy dynasty.  With another advisor who intends to raise the heir to be hedonistic and pliable, so that they can control them for their own personal gain, you have to decide whether to focus mostly on your own research or to slow down your own career in order to focus on tutoring the heir and being a good counterbalancing influence (Or so they will be pliable to you instead of the other advisor).  As for your personal research, you have the choice between developing, and potentially excelling, at the skills of rhetoric, medicine, or techne (Technology).  The choices between your own skills, accomplishments, and service to the dynasty (With potentially serious effects on how Egypt is ruled) are the main focus of the game, and finding a good balance is what drives the story.I only have two complaints about the game.  The first is that it feels a bit short, but that might be because Choice of Robots was fairly long and I expected this game to be similar.  The second was the ending where you can invent the steam engine.  It is one of three different choices at the end where you can create a significant lasting work.  Two of them are an epic literary work and the germ theory of disease.  In these endings, your work has an effect on world history, but it is not an overwhelming one.  However, the steam engine ending has a very major effect that does not feel realistic to me.  Based on the level of technology at the time, it is extremely unlikely that a practical and economic steam engine could be developed.  Personally, I felt that maybe the option should have been that you develop a philosphy that the universe is a clockwork mechanism, similar to the devices that you have focused on studying and developing, leading to an earlier development of the scietific method and empericism by subsequent generations."

This is my initial impression after two playthroughs. It's not as good as Choice Of Robots. It seems harder to influance events and relationships. I think it might still need patching. A lot of choices in the second two thirds of the game that I believe should have raised your skills or relationship had no effect on them. I have to believe this is a bug as nearly every screen in Choice Of Robots raised or lowered something. Because of this it seemed to lower my ability to affect the course of the story. I could be completely wrong, that is just my impression. That being said the story was very interesting and enjoyable. For the pitance price they are asking for this everyone should buy it. This developer and author should be supported to encourage the development of more games like this. They are 100% correct when they talk about the power of your imagination. Reading a good story that you are taking part in is more immersive then any cutting edge game with graphics."

Instead of pure fiction, supplemented by bits of history, it uses history as a base and fiction to walk the what if paths. Some blanks, like Euclid's gender, have been filled in though.So what to make of this game? As the nameable scholar protagonist you can focus on many different things, some in combination. Your choices do make a difference in how things play out. But there's the sense that in the background things are afoot too, historic occurrances taking place and so forth, that may or may not come back to haunt you.Ultimately though, I think you'd best experience this game for yourself. It is good, within its genre, and for its price something you'll not regret picking up. If you like it, consider Choice of Robots by the same author as well."

In short, this game provides a wide range of choices about how you wield your influence in and around the city of Alexandria. As someone who has taught Egyptian history, I've found it really quite fascinating.However, the game is not as strong as Choice of Robots. This is not a bad thing! Robots is, maybe, the best choicescript game released. With Robots, I felt very attached my little creation and the cast of supporting characters. Alexandria just doesn't quite reach that same level of attachment with the young Prince you help raise.Much like Robots, however, Alexandria truly succeeds at making you feel like you're altering the course of history.Still, this is definitely one of the better Choice Of games around. If you like history, philosophy and so on, pick it up. If you liked Robots, pick it up."

The decisions you make actually impact what happens next as oppose to some of the others. This is great for people who are interested in the history of Alexandria and scholarly choice making. You can invent stuff, raise a prince, and as guide a kingdom to glory or ruin among things. You can even hang out with Archimedes, so if you're into the pre-electric era machines you'll enjoy that (I know I did, he's written as a total bro too).Kevin Gold did a great job writing the story and taking the time to create a ton of different paths to take. I think there are 7 unique endings and a bunch of achievements giving this game a lot of replay value. If you dig this game you'll really like Kevin Gold's other ""Choice of"" game called ""Choice of Robots"". I personally like ""Choice of Robots"" better because I'm more into sci-fi than historical books, but of all the ""Choice of"" authors Kevin Gold is easily the best."

If you enjoyed CoR, I definitely recommend Choice of Alexandria.  If you haven't played CoR, I recommend Choice of Alexandria if you're interested in alternate history stories, because this is a good one.CoA has many endings, many paths to those endings, and provides interesting choices (and consequences) along the way.  You also don't need to be a history major to understand the story either, which was my only real concern before I tried the demo."

Normally you're a decisionmaker (starship captain, US Marshal, or at least a loner), managing various relationships but bound by none.  In this game most of your ultimate goals can be achieved only by influencing young prince Ptolemy IV, or sometimes king Ptolemy III.  Rupture that relationship, and much of the game falls out of reach.  But, of course, protecting the relationship has a price - including the fact that keeping your young charge happy is not always the best teaching strategy, and failing as a teacher has its own consequences.So this is basically a game about teaching and child-rearing.  As a parent, I enjoyed that novelty.  And the various choices lead to alternate histories that are amusing, even intriguing (despite one terrible Fight Club joke)."

I've always had a soft spot for alternate history, and the Library of Alexandria is one of my favourite topics, so this game fits into my interests.I would say that Choice of Alexandria does have issues with characters, in that I find it hard to get as emotionally attached to the characters compared to other Choice Of games. They are well written and devloped, but harder to get connected to for me. That said, the writing is excellent and immersive, and I've really enjoyed just seeing the different endings I can produce.As usual, I do wish that Choice Of Games allowed for colour customisation.
