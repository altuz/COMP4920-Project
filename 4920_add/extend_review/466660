I have played so many MMOs and they all seem like variations on the same thing. Stash is really unique and brings some cool new ideas.Turn based combat is what jumps right out. You have time to plan and think and I really like that.Your house (called your BOO or base of operations) is quite impressive. I can already see that this feature is incredibly deep and I will put a lot of time into making my BOO killer.A number of people have mentioned the community and I thought that was bs but then I got in game and they were right. The people in game are great and the devs are very open and honest and clearly care about this game a lot.It is indeed early access so nothing is perfect but i can tell the rough edges will get dealt with and this is already a lot of fun.

(Will become open later.)If you plan on joining keep a eye out for Gragus (my character). I am always willing to help new players find there way around the world.

It's a great game to be able to borg, craft, as well as build your BOO.  The music gives you a bit of a rush in combat as it sets tone of ""ok this is serious!""The biggest plus and advantage to this game over others are the admin staff, they actually CARE and want you to enjoy the product and they will strive to listen to the community as well as update, expand, and make the game better.You also won't find a better community of gamers than the ones who have supported Frogdice over the years, they really are a great company, and really do care about customer service."

It has plenty of content already from what I saw, though there's some rough edges. I chalk the roughness up to it being in Early Access, and from what I've seen on the posts, the game is updated fairly often. I think it will only improve over time. If you like table-top style board games, and also looting games, this is a safe bet."

The style of the game totally reminds me of my old college DnD group. Community is already fantastic and super helpful. People are always talking to each other and helping out.Early Access has pros and cons. The con is things aren't totally finished and you have to experiment and go through more trial an error to figure out what to do. I get that and I can already see the devs working their butts off to improve all that rapidly.The big pro is I like that my feedback has a bit impact already and I get to be part of a growing community.People thinking about buying this should keep in mind that this is not full release. It will be harder to figure out what to do right away, and if you dont like that then hold off for a bit. But if you want to be part of what I think is going to be a real game changer in the mmo genre, then jump in!"

Great graphics (which have actually improved in clarity since the last time I loaded it up) and an in depth but well explained crafting setup.- A good amount of materials drop from battles.- The ability to buy items/bonuses with pay currency AND in game currency within reason (indie devs can learn a LOT about this sort of setup)- What appears to be a pretty cool housing concept/FOB.- Lag/rubberbanding has been reduced since I first played.10/10 would make myself look like a moron again.

,Recommended,466660,29350591,Posted: 18 January,all,Lysamvor,I've been waiting for a game like this my whole life. I've enjoyed many MMOs in the past but have had enough of the whole autoattack/white damage/use abilities on rotation style of combat. That was fun and all but I've done that enough now.Player housing has become an important feature to me and is one of the first things I look for in a new mmo. The housing system here in Stash (they call it your BOO or Base of Operations) is the best I have ever seen. They say your BOO is like half your character and I believe it. I can't believe how many ways you can upgrade and level it up.I hope this game gets a lot more visibility soon as it really deserves to have a huge playerbase. I know I will definitely be telling all my friends to jump on board immediately. This is a perfect type of game for early access as the devs have already shown they listen to players and that means we get to have input now into the direction the game will go. That's cool.

There are some rough spots as to be expected (Elementalist Tooltips some abilities display what the extra status effects do, and some do not, but I can see that they're adding those in as things get fleshed out). But for the most part, the FOUNDATION of this game is strong, it has a unique premise and a good framework for both solo and party play. Right now, at least with an Elementalist, some of the four creature encounters can get a bit overwhelming, but with a good understanding of turn based RPGs you can survive. I look forward to this game developing further, as I've seen good things from this developer in the past.You would be wise to at least keep an eye on Stash, if not pick it up on Early Access."

Character development options are already numerous and I can tell things will be branching out more as I keep playing. The art style is very reminiscent of tabletop gaming with your friends.The game is not easy but not punishing. You have to make decisions and choices, and there are clearly a lot of things to earn. Levels, stats, and gear are the obvious mmo type stuff, but building up your house, your storage space, your personal carrying capacity, and many other things show me that I have a lot of ways to improve myself. I really like that.So far the people in game have been really nice as well. The devs are active and seem to really want to make this a great game.I look forward to how Stash develops."

What I like about Stash is that not just one Developer that plays Stash and Talks with the community but the whole team does as well. The Stash Community is also willing to help out anyway they can to make sure that you feel welcome and a part of the community whether you have been playing MMO or new to it. This is one of those games if you and your friends are looking for something different or just a change in the scenery but same Genre then I believe you and your friends would enjoy Stash.Note: Pros and Cons subject to change based up full releasePros+Helpful and friendly Community and Development Team+Development teams willingness to listen to the community+Options and classes they have right now+Being able to customize your home, craft and sell your items to the community+Trade System+Trade Crafting, Maker, Armorer, Weaponsmith, Cook, Alchemist, Enchanter+Personable Game all around.+Not a Pay to win MMO though you can buy Medallions for special costumes, extra inventory, special mounts, but those same items you can use ingame money you earn to buy same thingsCons-Sometimes Laggy-Leveling up seems slow but they have events that gives Exp boosts to help with leveling-some of the tasks are not completed ingame yet so will have to wait till completed-Somewhat of a tutorial so it can be hard to figure out in the begining but gets easier with time and community. But this issue is    being worked onOverallThis is a great game that I would reccomend to anyone thats looking for a new game experience. Yes it is Early Access but after talking to the developers and watching them interact with the community like they do I see this becoming one of more popular MMOs on Steam. This is a Gem worth having in the library.  If you do decide to purchase it Come have an ale with me at the INN ask for Tetzu."

That itself is worth a few dollars.After 20 hours I figured out eating food all the time, selling everything, and having several harvesting tools on your character are all critical.If your looking for a simple fun game to spend some time go for it, I believe it will improve with time.  IF your looking fortotal polish you may be dissapointed.  Videos and websites and even forums telling you what to do and how to do it are not going to be in abbundance.For the price of a soda and some snacks what can be the harm.150+ Hours Later . . and f2p opening upThe game still holds interest for me.  You do figure out tactics, what potions to use, what equipment to seek out or make for your character.  With the advent of some game updates you can adjust the scale of Random dungeons to suit your needs.Everything I still holds probably more true now than the day I wrote it.Enjoy"

Frogdice is known for having a great community base with fantastic staff, and Stash is no different.  It's not overly difficult to pick-up the game even though it's in early access (so bugs are to be expected), and I really like the turn-based combat portion of this MMO, which gives me the time I need to plan and strategize before rushing face first into combat.  Of course, since I like playing MMOs, my ability to horde everything is satisfied fully with Stash's game mechanics.  Can't wait to see this in full launch, I know the developers will take all the feedback and work their magic to make everyone happy."

This game delighted me to the point I had to break out of my usual shell and share my experiences.The MMO genre has grown pretty stale. Everyone knows this. How nice it is to see an INDIEDEVELOPER finally step in and change things up. This is why indie games are the most important thing in this industry. But I am distracted.Every facet of this game is simple at first but quickly reveals layers of depth. Combat. Housing. Crafting. Character development. I have only scratched the surface but I already see so many layers.When I read the forum for this game I see a development team that cares a lot about this game. That is one of the most important things for any game but especially online games. Does the dev team love the game and are they devoted to it? It is very obvious that Frogdice loves this game and wants it to be great.

It has a lot of fixes still as to be expected with an early access game, but if you're looking for a different kind of RPG then give it a go.Pros:Unique style of gameplay - Offers a more casual, different approach on the typical RPG.Crafting - A crafting system. It has one.Combat - A heroes of might and magic take on combat.Developers - Active devs that listen to the community.Party System - A very simple and fantastic party system.Base of Operations - Like player housing. Your central HUB.Soundtrack - Nice ambient music. Not sure how limited the soundtrack is though.Character Customization - Not bad, It's not fantastic but it was a lot more than what I was expecting.Cons:Difficult to understandat first. I feel the overwhealming ""what do I do?"" at the start of the game could deter players from giving it a good try. There should be a tutorial or at least more detailed, thurough help pages.Some bugs/fixes that need to be addressed.Crafting - It's crafting system is somewhat limited and difficult to understand. There are 4 ""professions"" and some gathering tools. I hope they can expand to give some more options later on.Party Base - I feel there should be a party option where multiple players can enter a single BOO within a party and interact with it.I gave this a positive review because I think the game is on the right track. I wouldn't say it's ready to be played at it's full potential just yet. For the quality of the game and considering it's early access right now I'd say it's price is a bit steep. If you compare it to game quality of other games and such I feel this game should be priced between 10-13$ CDN, instead of 17$."

I enjoy the fact that it's turn-based as well as click to move with the game itself plotting a path to where you want to go. Negative: sometimes the paths take you through locations that prompt you whether you want to enter or not. I find that a little annoying. I wish the pathing would take you around the location and/or not trigger the prompt unless I had specifically clicked on it.I really enjoy combat. It has a really old-school video game feel to it. I played a game a long time ago on a Sega Genesis that was similar. Grid areas, turn based, etc. There is also a very noticeable difference in combat between the classes offered and how you have to approach encounters. I like that a lot. 4 classes and every one of them is genuinely different.Overall I like the game. I really enjoy the company as well. Frogdice games are something I have been playing for ~20 years. They have a tendency towards ""subtle depth"" in their games. They don't beat you over the head with the lore. They let you uncover it - and I have a distinct feeling that same approach is included in this game as well.I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys spending hours and hours at their computers. It would be great for people who are looking something to do in the background that they can walk away from without worry that they're losing something.The community also seems very helpful. Any questions I've had has been answered rather quickly. Something not always found in a game."

I did put in a ticket and updated it consistently over the past 20 days, but no feedback from Frogdice.  I will play single, but we still want to play together.  We both purchased the game to do so.  Hopefully this is fixed before full launch.UPDATE:  The company had missed my ticket due to a 3rd party ticketing system.  Next, they worked closely with us to be able to be able to resolve the issue.  It was a very oblique bug that had not been found before.  The company fixed it immediately and now I am able to play with my husband.  Great game!  Love it and cant wait to play more."

The DEVs are very focused on being in the game to help and want to address every problem as soon as it happens. This is a game for people who want an oldschool feel and dont mind working a little to build a character."

The BOO (your house) is the best player housing system I've ever seen in an mmo. The community and developers are excellent and I can already tell will be huge reasons I hang around for a long time.I have already seen so many interesting ideas or new twists on standard mmo mechanics. These developers have definitely set out to bring something new to the mmo world and I for one am thankful for it.More people should know about this game! I really enjoyed playing it solo and it was also a lot of fun grouping with other people. The tactical elements of combat became even more interesting then. Most of my friends hate early access so I can't get them to play yet, but I know they will play once the game has its full release.I would like to see a little more information early on explaining how things work and maybe more information in tooltips. I saw on the forums that the developers are already planning to do this, which is very encouraging.In summary, this is a wonderful and interesting game that I am so glad I found!"

,Not Recommended,466660,26586271,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,Gary,If you're thinking about buying this I'd recommend you watch some Youtube videos on it being played before getting it - its combat is extremely slow (even for turn based) and needlessly faffy. I got bored and disliked its mechanics even before the first fight ended.It's early access of course so that could all change.

,Not Recommended,466660,25822473,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Squishydew,"Honestly can't recommend this, if you're interested you're better off playing something like Dofus or Wakfu.The game works well and isn't buggy, but whats there just isn't particularly interesting, and the game doesn't explain itself very well at all, though that could be excused given that It's in early access.This game has a long way to go and is not worth a purchase in It's current state.I also really dont get the decision to keep the grid based movement in the overworld, it feels clunky and out of place, free movement on the world map would be much nicer.I'll revisit the game a couple of months from now and see if this review should be changed."

,Recommended,466660,33882488,Posted: 29 July,all,Some Guy From The Internet,"Updated: 9/12.I want to love the game, it has elements from Dofus and Project Gorgon both of which are pretty good indie MMOs. Touch of Wildstar in there as well.However I don't love it like I should. The UI sucks, the bugs are plentiful and there's not much to do but kill and craft. I enjoy killing and crafting though.Combat is slow, a lot of elements of it are poorly (or not at all) explained and there's still a lot of work to be done.Potential is hidden in there, but there's not a lot of meat, not a lot of population and not a lot of reason to play.I'm changing it to a positive review now that it's free, because it is worth trying out just to play a MMO that isn't the same garbage."
