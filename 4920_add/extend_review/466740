I played the game on my desktop, but it’s also available in VR.You play as three different characters throughout the game. From these three perspectives, you explore and find information that gives you some insight into the murder of Araya. By putting all the pieces together, you uncover the truth behind her death. I found it was a little bit confusing to be jumping back and forth between the different character perspectives. The story was fine though, and by the end, I think I understood most of what happened.Most of the gameplay is walking around the hospital, and exploring each room to find clues about what happened to ARAYA. You'll need to find keys, or other objects to progress. ARAYA also has thrilling chases sequences where you run for your life, crawling under and hopping over obstacles as you search for an escape to safety. There are also a lot jump scares as well, and some of them were very well placed, and got me really good. There were so many of them that I started to anticipate them, and the majority of them didn’t even phase me.Pros:the majority of ambience, and sound effects are done well, and are effective at creating the creepy and often tense atmosphereno worry about draining the batteries of your flashlight as you move through the dark, and immersive environments like in other horrorschase sequences are enjoyable, and the music makes it very exciting, and somewhat terrifying (these were easily my favourite parts of the game)some well placed jump scares that are sure to get youenvironments look decent enough, and there are a few unique areas, and the character designs and animations are alrightCons:opening doors to the rooms feels clunky, especially when you are running for your life; also, if you get too close to the doors, it’s hard to click on them, and you have to take a step back to open them(nitpick) no controller support, and the keybindings are not customizable (most people will be fine with the defaults though)(nitpick) while the voice acting is fine, some of the text is a bit different from what is actually being at times(nitpick) the footsteps sound is way too loud, and is the exact same on all three characters(nitpick) most areas looked like more of the same hallways and waiting rooms though, and the characters aren’t as realistic or appealing as the environments areThe game took me around 4 hours to complete. I don’t feel the need to replay it, but people who want to experience it in both VR and on their desktops, or those who didn’t fully understand the story the first time might want to.Conclusion:ARAYA is a decently made game. Sure, there are small improvements they could make, and the game is by no means perfect. Overall though, it’s not a bad pick-up for those looking for a combination of spooky atmosphere, jump scares, and tense chase sequences.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."

In fact, just five to ten minutes in you'll come to realise that the game's use of sound goes beyond merely ""scary"" into the realms of downright ♥♥♥♥ing TRAUMATISING at times! Which is a good thing, of course, in a horror game, to have such terrifying sound; an almost obligatory thing, one might argue. Shame that so few indie horror developers seem to realise this...But not the makers of Araya. Oh no. Spooky but generally subtle music gives way to banshee-like shrieks and a din worthy of Hell itself, often at the shortest of notices. This is one game which knows how to build up suspense and pay it off, mostly aurally, with jump scares galore - ♥♥♥♥ you all, when they work, they work great! - and an opening chase sequence which almost made this Outlast veteran break down into tears. I'm not saying it's ""subtle"": I'm saying it's by-and-largely EFFECTIVE, however that effect might be achieved.It also does some other things well which many other horror games don't: the flashlights, for example, are quite perfect. They illuminate enough, without illuminating TOO much, creating a kind of claustrophobic funnel which you view much of the game through. There's often a feeling that someone - or something - could be lurking just outside the peripherals of that persistent circular beam. And many is the time that I was afraid to turn around once I realised the door in front of me was locked: you never know what the game is gonna throw at you next, or when. The atmosphere, overall, is quite, quite excellent.The graphics, unfortunately, are not. Character models, in particular, are a bit on the chintzy side when viewed up close. Environments are also not-very-vividly realised, but this is all largely acceptable in an indie game of such otherwise decent quality. I'm not too sure about the fifteen dollar price-tag, though, and would probably advise most potential buyers to hold off for some kind of a sale. Myself, I play so many cheap horror games that I consider it frankly miraculous when one manages to be this tense, and of such a semi-reasonable length, and thereby consider my fifteen bucks well spent. But that's just me. If you're in any way, shape or form a ""this wasn't worth fifteen bucks, maybe ten at most"" kind of person, then definitely wait for a sale price.How scary did I find this game, honestly? Put it this way: this game made me oddly thankful for the fact that I DON'T yet own a VR headset. Honestly, that opening sequence was traumatising enough WITHOUT a headset, and there's plenty of other noteworthy ""moments"" in the few hours which follow. Not a ""great"" game, by any stretch, but a surprisingly good one which does what it primarily sets out to do: spook the bejesus out of you. Done deal, far as I'm concerned (though that ending really did suck).Verdict: 8/10.(PS You will often find yourself staring at a lengthy blank screen when you're pretty sure a load should be happening. Don't fret. It WILL load, in my experience. Just chalk it up to another of the game's stress-inducing tactics - at least, I'm gonna choose to BELIEVE it was all deliberately devised, haha - and you'll get there in the end.)"

But if you have a Oculus Rift and want something atmospheric and creepy give this a try.With the headset on and volume high i genuinely find myself not wanting to explore at times. The sounds are spot on and immerses you in this hospital.(one jump scare had me spilling my beer)If you have a Rift and starving for an immersive horror experience, give this indie title a go. its 15 bucks well spent on a VR title on a platform with limited quality content. This gets me excited on what this studio does with VR moving forward.This is a VR experience from an Indie company not a AAA game,it is good for what it is."
,Recommended,466740,33097870,Posted: 1 July,all,Beelzeboss,"ARAYA is a horror game set in an abandoned hospital where you will play as three main characters. Story can be a bit confusing at first since three characters will have different parts of the story that will eventually come together after you keep progressing through the main storyline. There are collectibles scattered around that you will have to find. Some of these can be helpful to understand what actually is going on. In my personal opinion; the game is a mixture of creepy atmosphere and exploration like Layers of Fear, intense chase moments like Outlast, and Asian horror themes like DreadOut. It's not the best horror game to be honest, but it sure is very good compared to other horror games that fail on so many levels.What this game does best+ The atmosphere. Seriously creepy.+ The sound effects. The game manages to make players uncomfortable by playing some well placed sounds. In fact, the sounds will get you most of the time other than the actual jumpscares. Everything gets intense during chases just because of the sounds that play in the background.+ Some of the voice acting are good, some are okay.+ Good story. Short, but I wasn't expecting a long story either.+ Jumpscares are minimal and quite good.The bad- Camera glitches. These random camera glitches can be seriously annoying, especially when you are being chased.- The controls are clunky. It takes a bit time to get used to it.Overall it's a good game with some bugs. Just don't expect it to be great. If you love playing horror games that creates heavy tension and eerie atmosphere then get this."

(But sounds ok for english, if you are thai and can understand english go for it).Poor control in some situation. It gave me so much headache (If some of you guys ok with that, good for you)Very buggy, in my case the game saved when my character droped under the ground and unplayable unless I have to restart the whole game, WTF! (I was playing on chapter 7 if you ask me)But it has decent story and sound effect and music and it can make you scare for good.If you don't mind the cons above it's a decent game for this price (ิbut it'll be good if a little bit cheaper).But for me it failed in many ways. I give it 3/10."
,Not Recommended,466740,28092189,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,STAGsby,"This game had SO MUCH potential, it hurts to see where it went.The beginning of this game was AMAZING. I was in to it, and ready to be scared. And for a while, I was trembling, but, as the game went on, it got less scary, and more annoying; almost as if the devs got tired and rushed the end. The final ""puzzle"" with Rama, was the end of me. If the rest of the game was as good as the first 30 minutes, the game would have earned a 5 star review from me, but I cannot even give it a recommendation at this point. If I could describe this game in two words, it would beOutlast CloneOn a side note, the translation was like 9.99/10; there were a few minor mistakes, but nothing that really detracted from the game at all.Story: 9/10 -- was really great.Gameplay: 2/10 -- I have played worse, but this is pretty low on the leaderboard.I would recommend based off the story alone, if you can look past it. But as it stands, a game should have good gameplay, and this game just doesn't have it.My playthrough can be found here."
,Not Recommended,466740,29302940,Posted: 16 January,all,ThatsMeTYLER,"I like horror games like Outlast, Layers of Fear - yes even Daylight is one of my favorites. This game really moved me to request a refund because of all these glitches, terrible controls and crashes during gameplay.Developer stated they fixed rendering errors and many other problems with the game - but not for me. You cannot really set up the controls. There is no option for e.g. toggling between pressing or holding the crouch key.  You have to hold that crouch key all the time while you crouch. If you have no gamer keyboard there could be some ""ghosting"" because you have to press so many buttons at a tome. So guess what you have quicktime events. I had to press ""W"" (walk)+""Shift"" (run) + ""E"" (you have to press that because of the QTE) and Ctrl (crouch) Even my Razer keyboard said NO,NO please stop pressing so hard!!!! Please not another key!!!Also jumping is hilarious. It doesn´t even look like the player jumps over an obstacle - NO! The player is like hover right through desks, beds or whatever you have to jump over.The enemies (I only saw that guy - naked from the waist up wielding a knive ) are hovering through objects too. That is stupid. Why doesn´t  this guy even wear a shirt? Why is he walking (or hovering) like a snail??? Why is the player walking like in slowmo? Why does running feels like walking in Outlast? Why are the sounds suddenly break up and you hear nothing not even your footsteps?? Sometimes the game is blocking your view because you suddenly see your head or arm or whatever in front of you which is really weird and distracting.Guys I really don´t wanna sell it short but this game is technically bad, really really bad - exept the grapics because the game is powered by Unity engine. The tutorial was interesting had nice atmosphere but after that I got hooked.... NOT!If you like horror games and you don´t have Outlast, Daylight, Layers of Fear, Resident Evil 0 or Resident Evil HD Remaster. This is the better choice and worth the money!"

I like it enough to recommend it at full price. But there are some flaws; which for some may make it easier to wait until it's down to about $10.The bad stuff:Mouse sensitivity! I really need this to be much higher. Even with it turned all the way up, I look around sooooo slooooow.  I would be beyond tickled pink if this could be updated.Chase sequences! For the most part, these are ok. There are a couple that are a little buggy where the person/ghost chasing you moves too fast and instantly kills you. This makes a couple of the achievements incredibly hard.The good stuff:Story! Some of the voice acting was a bit too dramatic for me, but I loved the story a lot! And I also loved all the little side clippings and info that I would find while I explored everywhere.Spoopy! This game is loaded with spoops. They wear off a bit on multiple playthroughs, but I think they are very well done.Puzzles! A couple of these were head scratching, but they are all mostly straightfoward and mesh well with the game.Atmosphere! I was thoroughly creeped out while playing. Spoops aside, an abandoned hospital is always an excellent choice for unsettling feelings.Overall, I enjoyed this game quite a lot and hope to see more from these Devs."
,Recommended,466740,28358261,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,krisdang111,"I made this review after I finished the game. Araya is an ok indie horror game. I had quite a good time playing it. Do I recommend this game? Hmm....yes and no. To be honest, I had some kind of love and hate relationship with Araya and her big boobs friend. Let's go to each topics one by one.***StoryThere is nothing new in Araya in terms of story. The plot you'll see is something people become familiar with. Especially for Thai people, you can guess the whole story since the first chapter. There are some Thai beliefs that were put into the game which foreigners may not understand. Voice acting is quite ok for some characters but most are not good.***GameplayOverall gameplay is a bit below-par in my opinion. There are jump scares. But sadly, many times, the timing isn't right. Some events aren't connected to others. There were many times that I wasn't sure that the game crashed or were loading the next scene. Sometimes when I was bombarded by scary ghosts, I expected there would be something more. But there were gaps between those events and I felt bored more than scared. Some puzzles are a bit unrelated to the story. Characters animation is like a game during early 2000s era.***ControlThe control is not okay. You can't customize your own buttons. The door opening mechanism is something new, but only at the first few times, after that you'll hate it. Especially when your character is running away from someone (or something). When you're being hunted, the game bypasses the clunky door opening mechanism and replaces with just hitting 'e' button. But it won't be like that the whole game. Sometimes you can do that, later...you just can't. And it's pretty annoying.***AtmosphereIt was quite good for me. As a Thai gamer, I always wanted to play Thai horror game. It could be scarier. But good enough for an indie company that has limited resources and budget.***OverallThe game isn't good but the price is also not expensive. If you have some money left in your steam wallet and want to try East-Asian style of horror games, you should buy it. Be aware of all the warning above. If you can overlook them, you'll have good time with Araya. But if you need a quality-assured product and you have a near perfect expectation, don't waste your time and money. You'll hate her later.+++PRO- Cheap- Thai ghosts- Creepy environment- Quite okay story---CON- Control- Animation- Short- BugsI gave it 6/10.PS. UPDATE YOUR GRAPHIC CARD DRIVER TO THE LATEST VERSION.It can reduce lagging viewport and randomly mouse jumping (my characters died many times because of this problem)."

76561198017063732,Recommended,466740,27377041,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,bluechokobo,Cons - there are bugs. For example there are times when you turn right and take a step or two and the next thing you know you are turned around.  Sometimes i found it difficult to duck or open doors.  Not a bug but the run speed is at a walk.  You have a ghost chasing you and it feels like you are running through a swamp.Pros - overall had a lot of fun.  Jump scares were a plenty.  I liked how it was different then most of the horror based games in the US. Liked how there were multiple things going on at the same time instead of one main character.Overall thought it was a good value for the price. it is short but i think if the game was longer i would have been more frusted with it.

This game would not cooperate with steam, you have to turn off the game and log back in order to receive acheivements. Even then it was unsuccesful, I played the final chaper twice and I still did not receive it. But all in all, like I read through the comments, it felt like the game was unfinished; It glitched way to many times and the dark areas in the game were way to overboard. Its worth the play if it was for sale for 15$, I would buy it cheaper(special) if anything and you may enjoy it better knowing you didnt spend the full price for it."

This game has p0rn level voice acting, repetitive objectives, levels and scare attempts. Swapping a character once may be interesting, but doing to four times to just waltz around aimlessly. every time you enter a new area there are closed doors everywhere and most of the time you don't find a key but you need too reach a certain trigger point in some corner and then turn back so the door will be open then for no reason. that's literally every new area. you HAVE to check every door multiple times because NOW it could be open all of the sudden. also why do people still try to fullfill their stupid mission like photographing sprayed gang signs when they are getting chased by a ghost and a killer and what not?this game would be good for a trailer or one level and that's about it."

And most part there worked very well, but still .. There are lots of area they can improve it. Start with character animation... I mean all of it (human + non-human).Modelling do quite well but the poor animation is what drag it down. Physic and interactive with environment also needed improved. Speed of character moving is what kill me most… the character is walk+run tooooo slow, or maybe that what the developer need players to experience the environment… not sure.Cut scenes, I’m really liked the cut scene of each chapter … but need more…. Also the loaded time between each chapter and each save points…. Environment on the other hand, lots of love in to it …. Still … it kinda repeated a lots, however it still in the concept of horror and give me chill most of the time.Love the way developer try to put the story of each 3 main characters in to one … like the way story line is show up and the twist at the end ^^ good job guys. .. but the last few chapter is kind of short though.Audio in the game are come along very well  both FX and BGM is great when you put it together with perfect timing of Jump scare… many time my friend don’t want to go forward coz heard some FX… great job for that.

Most of them whould ultimatly boil down to be pet peeves, and honestly I think anyone that would enjoy a game would. This game just came out, and I can respect the effort put into it, as the idea of it isn't bad at all. Its just some things the game does bad, are so bad that it makes everything just negative.1. You move slowly.This isn't that big of a problem, as the game consists of as many almost identical hallways as possible, but when you are running from an enemy its basicly at walking speed, and really ruins the game's pacing. Especially if its a chase scene.2. The animation is garbage (easily the most noticable)There is nothing like ruining the experiance when the default walk animation is so derpy that it makes you just stop and laugh at it. The animations on the player model are even more garbage. For example, when you crawl it looks like you are pawing the ground. The worst part of it is that the cutscene animations are so bad it makes it look like a game made 10 years ago.3. The pacing is actually trashThere is nothing more off putting in this game (in my opinon) then the transition from chapter, to chapter. It usually ends in a cutscene but they shoot from one to the other that its just nasty. Even half way in the chapter the transitions from place to place just makes it bad, just REALLY bad. There is nothing else to really say to this, as the jumping from charachter to character really doesn't add anything else other than to keep the story progressing.]4. Graphics and Lag.This is more or less a personal issue, as I know I have a lower end PC, the idea of lag isn't very far from the truth in ANY game that I play. But the lag in this game is either in the title screen, or around a room with chains. I lowered the graphics setting and sit seemed to help, so there is that. Other than that the graphics, again, look like something from a game made at least 7 or 8 years ago, and the entire game gives off this Outlast meets Cry of Fear situation with lots of werid phyco things. Its hard to explain.But besides all that the game ITSELF isn't bad. The story is sub-par but the jump scares are good and the atmosphere is great as well. The designers really knew what they wanted to do with the enviornment and for that I give them a thumbs up.  However I say just the way the game has all of these problems, from graphics to pacing of the game, honestly I don't think it was worth the money. Maybe some amount of money like 10 or 7.50 dollars but its not worth 15. With all of its problems I will still give it a thumbs up mostly because I think what the game does well it does well, but the things it does bad are bad as well. In my opinon the bads outweigh the good, but if you want to give it a try its about as interesting as a horror game with terrible pacing and little plot with decent jump scares. So what ever you like."

The jump scares can sometimes be pretty good make you poop your pants but some can be so bad that it doesn't scare you at all lol.But the game does a amazing job making you feel so nervous and feel uneasy. There is some bugs but not game breaking at all. The story of it is pretty good you read papers you find and books , news paper. So as you play you learn something wrong happen.

I went into it blind and most of the time it felt very atmospheric and unnerving, which is a big plus for me in any horror game. Even though the animations, graphics in general and voice acting are a bit ""meh"" at times, the story about what happened to this girl called Araya and why she's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and haunting everyone kept me going.Compairing it to similar indie horror titles however, I'd say it falls a bit short. The game can be completed in about 4 hours easily (even when you take your time looking around like I did) and because the game is 99% on-rails (the exact same things and scares will happen on your 2nd playthrough) I probably won't touch it ever again.It's good for what it does though, and I certainly recommend this to any fans of the genre out there, though maybe wait for it to go on sale."

In this game there is no such thing as run & hide thing, except for a few times where you have to avoid a lunatic with a rusty knife and follow a specific path so that you can fall into a cutscene. At first it gave me the creeps, but as i was proceeding thoughout the game i was less and less afraid by the visuals and the jumpscares (which the game is lacking) and more from the eerie and disturbing sounds that literally blown my ears.

The hospital corridors are dark and ceepy, and you never know what awaits you at the next turn. Or above you, or even behind you. I found myself constantly checking my 6 o'clock and doing quick 180 turns to ensure I'm not being followed. Some may call this paranoia, but it's better to be safe than sorry.The ability to play three different characters adds much needed layer to the game's narrative. Not unlike the horror movie  anthologies of yesteryear, each character unveils plot points that not only serves the individual's story, but also adds weight to the Araya universe. These interlinking narratives help build (or create the illusion) that the game has a grander and bigger non-linear universe than what is being presented.Now, the cons. This otherwise above average horror game is marred by clunky mechanics, bad audio mixing, abrupt cutscenes and bad optimization. I find myself inching closer to complete deafness as the orchestral sting pierces my eardrums everytime my character picks up a note. To call the sound effects REALLY REALLY LOUD would be an understatement.The cutscenes end just as abruptly as it starts and this is often followed by long heart thumping moments of just utter blackness on screen. Did my PC crash? Is there a power trip? Is this game ACTUALLY cursed? The answer is worse than all three options combined - it's really long loading screens. These jarring black screens really impairs immersion, especially for us mere mortals without a VR kit.Despite its' flaws, Araya is worth the purchase and it'll tide you through till the next non-jumpscare horror game. No review is complete without the now mandatory youtube channel plug/playthrough link, so here's mine:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC4cJRfYTQEP.S. at the time of this review, I've only gotten one single achievement despite completing the game.

I decided to keep going.The Chapter 2 level design is comical, but I'm not spending decent money to be amused by terrible level design and reused assets. How many times am I going to have to step over the same row of yellow chairs or crawl under boards? During the first few minutes of Chapter 2, the answers to those questions were ""quite often"".At this point I decided to pause and consider my options before going any further. While they did give me a scare during the first chapter, the amateurish design was really pulling me out of the story and causing me frustration. I think that there are probably people who don't notice such things who could probably have a good time with this, but I'm simply too jaded to enjoy this game.Sorry, has to be a refund and thumbs down from me."

The game itself takes maybe 4-5 hours to play, depending how much you explore the environment around you which is good to understand some parts of the story.However, there are some backlashes which annoyed me throughout the game.The main one was the system of the opening of doors. I do not know how it is when you play on your VR machine but doing this with the mouse gave me a headache. Esp in situations when you needed to run from the monsters and the doors suddenly opened differently than the others.English voice acting and translation. As I was playing this game with a thai friend I kept the sound in thai and had english subtitles. The translation of Thai was very lame, she said, and lacked a lot of information. Moreover, trying the English voices, it sounded lame and unnatural.Sometimes the scary moments really dependend on luck. The area reacted welll in certain situations, but it happened quite often in a big spaces, like the parking lot that if you suddenly havent looked that direction but moved forward you missed the scary moments and it was only music which told you something happened. I felt less scared that time.Lack of explanations. The story ending was a bit lame. With or without the secret ending after the only choice you made in the game which had some importance (will not say what), the ending did not explain much. I really expected more from that.Nevertheless, the scary atmosphere was ok, and the idea good. Exploring the story through 3 different characters was a good idea in my opinion. Also to get foreigner players closer to Thai beliefs and mythology. Big like for that effort. However, the good potential of the game was not challenged to its fulled potential. Developers could exploit the game much much more. In this condition how it is, I also consider it a bit overpriced, still I would recommend it for an experience. It was refreshing. I would not put it for more than 10 euros. I am looking forward for the next projects.3/5"

I never heard of it before but I am very glad i tried it.  I am constantly on the hunt for the horror genre which includes exploring and unravelling a creepy story.  I am to the point i am just hoping it doesn't end as i truly enjoy every moment of it.  Let's see, hoping this isnt one of those games that are great throught-out with a disappointing ending.  I have high hopes for good ending as well, very good job Devs!!!!"

I would recommend this game because of the environment and The thai culture relate to the ghost story were very rich in this game

But there's one bug from the beginning till the end that is about the cursor, when the ghost appears the game little bit lagging and the cursor move by itself, i think it should be fix for the better game, cause it's very disturbing when i want to escape from the ghost but suddenly the game is lag and cursor is moved by itself. I Love the story very good."
