True to the original in my opinion while also adding a bunch of new twists, the music and dialogue throughout the game are solid, sometimes even disturbing (old lady, looking at you). Great little game for the price if you played Dope Wars back in the day."

Unlike better (and better quality) games, The Dope Game is simplistic to the extreme. Ride the bus, listen to the repetitive lady to find clues about drug costs, sell or buy at a location, then start over. Maybe you want to buy a gun. Or go to the bar. Blah. I could care less. The first game was over in 15 minutes and I won without even trying. Maybe there is more depth here but I'm not interested in wasting time finding out. Not when there are much better games that have similar mechanics plus a lot more."

From police to robbers to loan sharks and clones! Truly, this game knows what it's doing.GameplayGameplay-wise, this game is solid; for a game that is worth a dollar it's really fun, it's not the Grand Theft Auto type crime game, but it's like a CYOA (Choose your own adventure); you start with some money from a loan shark and from there you choose where you want to go and what you want to do with that money. This game is can really force you to manage a lot; you have to choose from different places to buy and sell drugs, each drug you buy has a different price for each area, you must choose a good area to buy the supply cheap and then find another area to sell it at the highest price as possible. Raising enough money can help you buy much more expensive drugs (that you can later sell at a higher price), more space for storing drugs, buying guns, bodyguards, using a store service to hide drugs, and some more. You must be careful though, random events do occur in this game and could really hurt you (or help)!Overall...this game is really fun, and for what you get it's worth the dollar or less.

That said there is PLENTY of room for improvement.1. The gang of guys with baseball bats should be combatable, if I have 5 goons and a chain gun you cant tell me I would run and lose things while I did it. I don't care if the odds are 10 to 1. I have a chain gun...nuff said. Dropping things every time a gang of ultra deadly baseball bats shows up is dumb as♥♥♥♥♥♥2. The market system is not even as good as DW's was. A lot of times a product you pick up you might have to hop 4-5 sections of town to find it even on market again and normally thats not for a profit when you do finally get it again.3. Dialog is used up entirely in your first 30 day run normally, some variation would be rather nice.All in all not a bad game for the price, you get a good deal of entertainment for $2 but it could definately be improved to keep people a bit more interested.If anybody knows of a drug dealer that loses product and money as often as you do in this game I would like to know that person.

The game itself however is pretty lackluster coupled with a mandatory install for another (free) game in order to unlock all the locations/perks in this game.The ""secret lab"" isn't implemented yet, and the ""fun park"" is pretty dull as well.The horrible horrible soundtrack.The music, and sounds, isn't bad for the first couple of playthroughs. But once you get the basics down, and start spending -10 seconds on each screen it gets pretty frustrating.From booting up the game, and clicking play there's a change in music. When you enter the game there's new music. When you switch screens/locations there's a change in music. Whenever you enter a shop there's a new music.There is NO consistensy other than the bad and horrible sound quality on each and every track.If the quality was better, and the continuity problems with it got fixed, it might help.The game itself is pretty straight forward, but lacks replayability.The only reason for my high play time is due to idling while playing and a mandatory playthrough-all-the-levels-and-modes crap.The achievements are utterly uninspiring, especially for a company that tries to sell itself as a ""developer under the influence"". There's no 420 achievement, not even for hauling weed/hash - However they had no problem making a ""haul 1million drugs"" achievement that only serves the purpose of being ""hard to achieve"".As mentioned earlier, when you get used to the game you spend less than 10 seconds on each screen - You're even going to skip the dialogs that also are pretty unimportant. Once you hit a certain amount of money you simply don't care about other drugs other than the high value ones.Once you got a cash flow going that's when you start depositing money. You should be able to end each 360 day game with +500mil from the bank and LIGHT selling.In order to unlock the 1mil drugs hauled achievement all you need to do is stand in town and buy/sell the same drugs over and over again; If you're going to do it this way, please have +700 storage units and some hand-support. The amount of clicks needed isn't fun at all.Which brings me to the game menu/buttons. You WILL have to click Buy, max, transact, sell, max, transact every god damn time you want to sell/buy anything. There are no shortcut keys, there's no pressing M for max, S for sell or anything remotely simply like that.I wouldn't recommend buying the game, unless for nostalgic reasons (which this game doesn't really live up to - The older versions are far superior), or for selling trading cards. The booster pack is pretty cheap (857 gems).E) Found a spelling error :)E2) Endless mode makes some of the achievements easier to attain, but ultimately it's still a suckie game.Also I won't edit out, needing another title to unlock bonus modes; it was required when written, and the update still adds no replayability.And it still sucks that we had to boost the Developers amount of users having downloaded that title, just to unlock something thats ultimately still not a fun park.Discount on animals, my♥♥♥♥♥♥.#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorHope to see some insane high scoresThat's easy: Since you just have to put money in the bank, and travel between safe locations, or without drugs on you = You won't die or get arrested ;)E3) The place to store your drugs is a joke. There is NO POINT in gambling with it. It adds NOTHING to the game in terms of substantial gameplay. It's just another stupid RNG element which is there to simply ♥♥♥♥ you over.I say again:There is NO NEED to be stashing drugs. You might as well get mugged while leaving or traveling to sell it. Or the idiot might just give it away ;)If you want to unlock the stupid achievements, just stand in the same town and sell the same drugs over and over again.Now that they added endless mode, you just need to deposit money in the bank and travel = done.Point of drug storage = To steal away <any> amount of drugs you bought, and to FORCE an install on you (which they then disabled - God knows why.. ;)"

It is a mix of a Visual Novel/point & click adventure/economic simulator where you have to Buy/Sell enough drugs to make a profit. You also have to decide where to sell & keep track of the authorities simultaneously.I found the game to be very easy (don't ask me why, But i know what to do!) & maybe too easy if you understand basic economic or financial budgeting. I liked the artwork alot, & found it to be very grimey & fitting for the atmosphere of the game. The Visual scenes are repetitive though, & you'll find yourself seeing the same chacracters over & over again through the quick playthroughs...& i barely felt the heat from the police, which did not bother me until I purposely tried to get arrested.To clarify about my game time (20 min logged on steam) I've purchased this game from another indieGaming site & spent almost 2.5 hours playing it, so for me, it is def a cool take on this genre but It did not capture my desire to revisit it more than twice.

Also, in one of my games I found 300,000 in the alley and while that's great and all, the game ended a few moves later because I won it. Technically I just found a bunch of money and it'd have been nice to continue on. Mind you I haven't played past 30 days so maybe some of these are included down the road, but I think it's a great idea that could really be fleshed out. Good job guys!

I need to also mention that the game is still being developed and the developer is active in the steam forums. its a fun game and it is cheap. glad to have it in my collection.

Its simple yet fun, it really draws you in once u start to make money and run into problem (cops, theives) things like that. I know its not for everybody and you shouldnt buy this unless you 18+ but all in all i have to say its very good. The intereactions with other charcters espically the lady on the bus cracks me up. The names and general attitude of the game is great. I can tell its made by some cool people an i would buy again. A+++"

Don't really know what the haters thought they were entitled to at that price point, but I certainly feel like I got plenty of entertainment value for my money.The only problem is going to be dealing with the withdrawls while I'm at work...UPDATE: After putting in a few more hours, I do want to say to the devs that the longest game (I think it's 320 days) needs some serious balancing of the ""events"" that trigger when you travel between cities late in the game. The last 100 turns or so you have a cop jumping on you 95% of the time which makes it impossible to actually trade any dope. Since trading is the whole point of the game, this takes a lot of the fun out of it and makes the late game much more of a grind. PLEASE DO SOME BALANCING OF LATE GAME EVENTS!!! Overall, I still recommend the game."

I'm genuinely surprised by the updates and level of commitment from the dev team. It's entirely governed by RNG, which will turn off some, and I'd recommend checking out a browser version of Drugwars before buying. The price is very fair and honestly could be higherThere is certainly fun to be had. With strategy and luck you can make a lot of money and arm yourself to the teeth.

You know, before the internet was a thing!  That one was set in south america and had the same kind of ""keep track of the price"" thing, with random events and such.  This one updates that idea with a kind of, I don't know, GTA style or something.  It is the first little crappy (non 50 million budget AAA game that is) game I have played in years and I love it.  Kudos to the dev team and respect for this fun little take on a classic concept.  Get out there and get slinging!!! That money ain't gonna make itself!!!!!"

Then i randomly picked up like 500k(which buys the best gun in the game) while having 50k (which is already a sizeable amount) and THEN cocaine was selling for 5K! it was usually around 16k at the lowest. So i bought like 140 units (the most i could carry). THE NEXT LOCATION, it did some dumb setback where i get scared by some gangbangers and I guess my characters is the worst drug dealer on the planet, because he dropped all 140 units of cocaine, and i went broke and floored my monitor..."

In addition, a play session's length can be selected, mitigating unnecessarily long and repetitive games.The basics of the game are as follows: The protagonist is a drug dealer, choosing to buy and sell a large variety of drugs in the city of Starkham for a set amount of time, beginning by taking a loan which is suggested to be repaid, but the option not to is given. The game revolves around profit: with assorted drug prices fluctuating over time in several locations, the player must find the best way to net enough money to pay of their loans, buy guns, hire bodyguards, et cetera, all the while under the council of an elderly drug addict on the public bus, who provides you with inside information and, occasionally, human teeth."

It should be noted that everyone, including yourself and the police, seems to have had the same blind gun trainer. Thankfully if you run into any serious trouble, you can trip 5 times before finally running away from the confrontation. And don't worry if you run out of bag space because there will absolutely be a backpack peddler smugly waiting for you at every location.Overall, it's an okay game. It's basically a revamped version of Kongregate's Dopewars. If you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy this. Now make your mother proud, buy 4 weed and chat with my spirit animal the bus lady.
