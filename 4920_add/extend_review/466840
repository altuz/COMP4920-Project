I like side scrolling shooting games, and I am happy with fairly basic graphics. You would be better off opening notepad and moving the mouse around an assembly of characters you have placed on the screen than playing this game. There is not even the most basic 'physics simulation'; move your mouse and the sprite will be there immediately. The author of this game seems to have the most infantile sense of humour I have encountered. If you want a good side scrolling shooting game, please search for Stargunner and you will find it can be downloaded for free. If you want a quick and easy side scrolling shooting game, please search for Alpha Bounty and play it in your browser; it is many times better than this feeble attempt. This game is cheaper than a bar of chocolate, but I am going to request a refund anyway because I object to the fact that this rubbish can be placed on Steam, a platform for games, when it is more like a scribble on a piece of paper while somebody was bored during a telephone conversation than anything resembling a game."

I got this in a bungle with Super Mega Neo Pug. I didn't want to buy this game but the bundle was cheaper then buying just SMNP alone.

Everything is way too fast and too clustered on screen for people to dodge (shooting obstacles is not worth anything, because hitting them just creates more obstacles.) It also doesn't help that half of the enemies come shooting at you from behind.Also, while everything I mentioned is going on, you also have to deal with wierd hitboxes, and glitches that randomly kill you, even if nothing is near you.It's broken and barely playable. I realize that it was released very recently and devs are probably working on fixing it, but it shouldn't be released in such state in the first place."
,Not Recommended,466840,23386119,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,rinimt,"My full review can be found on The Backlog.Super Space Pug would best be described as a Super Space Mess. The hitboxes are absolutely atrocious and will cause you to get hit by things you shouldn't have actually been hit by. There's pickups, but you'll find yourself getting hit by miles away objects trying to get them. The pug moves far too fast for being ""in space"". The description does mention that this is a ""speedy bullet hell"", but I would describe this as being too fast and not enough bullet hell.There are no unlockables to get, leaving you with a black pug on a black background shooting at dark coloured objects (since, you know, you're in space). There's no options menu, and the leaderboards will take you out of the game (and, in one case after a level, trying to cancel out of submitting my score closed the game).I cannot recommend Super Space Pug at all. If you're in the market for bullet hell games, there are far better ones out there on Steam."

The game is extremely dissapointing, and is terrible to the series itself. The game isn't fun, it isn't addictive like the rest, and it's just boring. The game is also poorly optimized. For now I will have this review negative, MAYBE the next big update will save it, but I don't know. If it does, I will change this to a positive review, As for now, the game is terrible and NOT worth buying.Avoid buying this game as of now."

When I played it yesterday,the game was scrolling way to fast and so much stuff was happening I couldn't even keep up with my own pug,instead I kept dying every two seconds it felt like,with the new update it seems to have at least sped down the scrolling a bit making the game actually playable for me and a bit funner,but with Pug Coins or any characters to be unlocked and no in game leaderboard it feels like you're doing nothing except gaining up numbers on the screen along with relentlessly murdering a pug.It's honestly missing quite a bit of content that these games always tended to offer us,which is like new characters mainly,honestly that's what made me love these pug games more than anything else,was unlocking the characters as you progressed. Sure it seems pointless,but it added much more vareity to the games,if you got bored with one character just switch to another one and play as it for a while,just never ever play the poor the little penguin from turbo pug,he tries so hard,yet he never makes it...oh well.Though for 0.12 from the Bundle since this was the only pug game I didn't own yet (along with making a 2 cent profit from the cards),I feel like I pretty much got my moneys worth for this game,but I would love to see this game progress instead of feeling like a rushed game just to make a lil bit of pocket change.Make the Pug Based God Proud!"

No other game can compare to the months, if not years, that the developers spent slaving at their computers coding this masterpeice. This game should not be on steam.  It should be on its own platform where only games with such artistic talent and amazing game play such as this masterpiece.
