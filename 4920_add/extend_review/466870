And that art is not something really astonishing in its performance, it simply shows us the things we're kinda used to, but almost never see with our own eyes. Right, the stars on the sky.There are two ways to look at it. For one, it's a simple full-complete game (quick achievements), with quite worthy Steam cards that might earn you some extra over the price of the game. That's pragmatic (in a way) point of view for basical consumer. On the other hand, watching the skies, reading about different constellations some basic info - that's not a usual thing in Steam, where people are taught to look under the blankets and throw the backend stuff at other people...So, if you're a basic comsumer - just get it for a small profit. If you're a stargazer like myself, who just loves the look of the clear night skies, mild music and all that - game's certainly a good thing to spend some time to.As of downsides, it is very short, not very accurate with details, and not translated to english good enough. Newb stuff. So, it might not hook you. But, as for me, it's more than worth its price. So I'll give it 7/10, for giving me an hour of a good time. Thanks to my friend Kurt, who gifted it to me! Спасибо!"

Back then, I knew how to recognize only a couple of them and the others remained a complete mystery to me. Until I played this little game.Aurora Nights is more of an educational software rather than a game, since there's no actual playthrough apart from connecting the dots representing the stars that compose each constellation. Of the 88 officially recognized constellations, the game teaches you how to recognize the 35 most common, in a very enjoyable and relaxing way. Additionally, for each group of stars you can read a small text explaining the origins of their name, most of these descending from Greek mythology.In my opinion, the game is worth the price, for it's unique and interesting concept and I hope to see in the future an extension to the game, featuring the remaining 53 constellations.More reviews on theLilly's Corner Curator page"

Normally, I try to be extremely supportive of these sorts of games, but this one falls a bit short.

Disappointingly, apart from the occasional menu screen, there are no aurorae. The graphics are nice, but pretty plain.

I enjoyed learning a little backstory on each of the constellations and the pattern repitition may just help me find them in the sky easier at night. However, there are a few things I think it could have added or could still add:1. Constellation Imagery - Everyone imagines the constellation's forms differently, but having a vague image to work with could help younger children link 3 dots with a dog or a string of dots as a snake. Something simple could go a long way to helper them remember it longer.2. More constellation information - The few facts and tidbits of info were nice, but I'd love to sink my teeth into something more since we're already thinking of this as an educational game. Give us some more information/trivia to keep our minds entertained.3. I understand the Northern Hemisphere is the most recognizable constellation map, but what about the Southern Hemisphere?

If it costed any more than it does, I would've considered a thumbs down. But for one euro (plus sale...) I find it hard to be angry at it. Aurora Nights evokes vibes that are both comfy and melancholic. It contains only one (!) piece of music, but it is perfect. It reminded me of some of the better tracks fromRimworldandThis War of Mine.So you get a non-game that's effortless to 100%, a few cards and some historical tidbits of - regrettably useless - lore on the constellations. And several moments of amusement that go like this: ""Where the ♥♥♥♥ do you see a giraffe inthis? What the ♥♥♥♥ waswrongwith ancient people?!""

The base gameplay is pretty simple, pick a constalation to ""spot"" and then just click on all the highlighted dots. These dots will reveal the contallation, and admittedly seeing the first couple of constallations reveal themselves is pretty neat. It doesn't change there is very little effort required to press on dots highlighted for you and i found myseld incredibly bored. I imagine this is meant to entertain incredibly small children, but i have a houndred games that babysit for me on my phone and they probably will hold a child's attention for much longer.2. The educational value is nonexistant in the main gameplay. After you've played follow-the-birght-dots you can go to the main menu to find more information on each constallation in text. While i'm sure the devs put a lot of time and effort into making those entries i just couldn't care less about them. I come to a video game to play not to read, and it really comes as a shock when a game that market's itself as an "" entertaining educational game"" has all the educational bits stored away in menus rather than the core gameplay. Admittedly i'd rather the books be here than none at all, but i don't see anyone learning about constallations playing this game.Now to be fair, you get to see the shapes of the constallations and if you want to three star a level in the game you have to memorize the constalation. That's neat, but to beat the game you only need to do it once and you'll probably be too bored of the game to play through every single map 2 more times. The three stars system feels like padding, but they're also where all the games challange is so hey if you want to entertain your kid beat the game once and see how they fare when they have to actually learn.Also the top part of the map is cutoff so there is a constallation just you just can't see. Tried changing from windowed mode to fullscreen, still couldn't see one of the constalations.Overall i was just dissapointed in the game. There's just nothing here behind a unique theme and the ability to left click."

,Not Recommended,466870,33895906,Posted: 29 July,all,odinoske,"Game is pretty simple - all you do is click on white little dots that appear bigger than other dots.Would be nice if spelling mistaks were fixed and the colour of stars were more accurate, but you do learn about astronomy and Greek Mythology.Wouldn't buy it unless it goes under 10 cents.The title is a bit misleading as well; there is no Aurora...As of now there is just the northern sky so not for people in southern hemisphere."

It consists of tracing constellations however the game gently reveals the next star as you go.  I was able to complete the game in its entirety in thirty minutes.  That said, I consider it worth the small price tag.The only thing I did not like was the nice soundtrack does not play during the constellation tracing but only in the region overview screen."

,Recommended,466870,33266309,Posted: 5 July,all,John Stockman,"Great educational game. Aurora Nights does not teach you the location of the constellations in the night sky, but rather how to spot the constellation if you were to see it among the many stars of the night sky. In other words, for example, it is like learning the name of every country and their borders, but not their location on a globe; although you may not know their place on a globe, you can simply look at any globe and be able to name the countries you see because you have memorized the names respective to the borders you see.Additionally, Aurora Nights changes the background-stars of the constellation you are learning to spot, and will notify you if you choose the wrong star; the background-stars reset and you start over connecting the dots. This gives you the opportunity to really learn and gain the confidence you need to accurately spot the constellations. I see this method of learning to also be useful in teaching you to ignore the ""noise"" of other stars as they too can ""change"" depending on how clear the night sky is where you go - you might go to a VERY remote area of earth and notice there are many more background-stars, but because you are confident in the ""changes"" of surrounding stars, you can still accurately spot the constellation."

,Recommended,466870,35481950,Posted: 4 October,all,RAT|Ethismos,"As en educational game i consider it quite good. You do learn about constelations, but I don't think you could identify them in the real sky just by playing this game.I see two big downsides to the game:1) there is no chalenge. The hinting system is too fast, you don;t have the time to think, some times even if you know which start you want to click on next the hinting system will get to it before your mouse. That's sucks a lot of the fun out and just makes it too easy, even for kids.2)No Southern hemisphere constelations. That's a pity... I wouldn't imagine it's too hard to add them...All in all I do recomend it as an educational game, but not as an entairtaining game."
