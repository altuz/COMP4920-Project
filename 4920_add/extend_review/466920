I ♥♥♥♥ing hate censorship. Yes to this game, no to censorship. Read other negative reviews if you want more information on what was censored. Don't support censorship, please. Pass on this game. It's good, but if you care about censorship, then stay away. If not, then this is a pretty good game."

Taking place immediately after the first game, you take control of the goddess Syrma, who meets Chou-Chou before the end of the first game’s events. Syrma is out to stop an ancient threat to her world that has recently awakened. 9999 levels of maniacal mishaps and ethereal adventures await Syrma, her crew, and hordes of Shampurus!Starting the game is something of a chore. It follows on directly from Mugen Souls, and the ruler of the universe, Lady Chou-Chou, is tired of the little piece of space that she spent her last adventure obtaining. She decides to take over twelve more planets, but her plan quickly unravels when she’s accidentally transformed into a powerless chibi version of herself. Yes, this is the actual plot. More surprising, it takes up to two hours to get to the basic gameplay. This Metal Gear-busting figure includes countless cutscenes, a few tutorials, and a music video, but it’s by no means the end of your learning experience. You’ll keep being introduced to new ideas for a long time.This is funny, because the mechanics themselves are actually fairly simple to grasp. The battle system is standard, although still enjoyable, and most of it is controlled via self-explanatory menus. The vast tutorials are presented almost as a parody of other JRPGs, but as is so often with titles of this type, the developer falls into the trap of doing exactly what it's satirising. “Look at us,” the company screams, “forcing you to read this 15 page how-to on changing underwear – isn’t that so JRPG?” Yes, changing underwear.If you like the first Mugen Souls you like Mugen Souls Z too its really fun and i think its also better then the first game."

But most of all the ease of play has been increased manyfold.-Moe Kills used to be a touch-and-go affair, but now you get a meter that predicts the amount of moe you will inflict, plus some percentile chances of an increased or decreased effect.-Linked moves are now in your ability pool, so you can just use basic attack if you wish.-The Mugen Field (AKA Level-Grind-Up-To-Overleveled-As-F**k) now has rest stops that you can heal up at and take a breather before continuing, or even get a free out if you feel over your head.-Mini Chou-Chou-Character models in general are greatly improved, and even move their mouths when talking.-Same old dirty humor.Overall I give this game an Undisputed God out of 10. Take that as you will."

This time we gonna conquer 12 worlds with new God Syrma (Chou Chou is playable only in post game true end). Conquest works same as in previous game where we walked from point to point and moed it to max meter and make world ours. This time however we can see on map where the points we need to conquer are instead of playing hide and seek with them. Syrma can't change her form like Chou Chou but can change her hair color so i guess it works... G-castle is a transformer... ok... Oh wait i forgot about the most important thing... U CAN JUMP NOW :D rly after u conq first world. Other thing that changed is that u no longer get free new skills for g-castle, now u need to buy them from shop :P. If u like end game grind and liked previous Mugen Souls u will feel like in home here."

Firt things first I'm a fan of the neptunia series and by seeing this was a Compile Heart/IF game I couldn't stop feom buying this ""Excellent Masterpiece""The story? fells like a god damn drag all along with all characters being ****oles with each other and that cliche of almost every character is either really dumb or just can't stop complaining..... Like the girl who can't accept that there's the godesses (and keep calling herself a hero .....).Graphics,Sound,Mechanics,Overhaul? No complaints there but,The VeredictUnless you play the game without caring for the storie or you're okay with the slow paced idiotic conversation styleDON'T BUY THE D*** GAMEseriously, you'll regret later!So for this one we give a ""Excelente Grade"" of [5.5/10] - Just above average 'cause I doubt a rpg player plays an Jrpg to dislike/ignore the story.END"

After doing a little searching the issue with the game may have something to do with SLi set ups, which unfortunitly I can not test without gambling on re buying the game or temporarily pirating it to test to see if disabling SLi fixes the issue (in which case if it does then re buying the game knowing that it will work). But since I don't pirate things even if just to check to see if a game breaking bug is fixed before repurchasing I guess I will not get a chance to play this game if it was just an SLi issue unless it goes on a 75% off sale where if I am out $5 I am out $5.If anyone gets this game who uses SLi gets that same error, please let me know if disabling SLi fixes the issue."
76561198000841849,Recommended,466920,25137707,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Miqunator,"Mugen Souls Z, like it's predecessor, combines the incredible/insane character development from Disgaea with a more straightforward combat system. Combat a bit like Neptunia or Fairy Fencer with a few added quirks like charm kills, buff/debuff giving crystals as well as ability to knock around characters.Story wise it continues directly from Mugen Souls' true ending and the gameplay is essentially the same (with a few improvements).Improvements from the first:-Charming enemies is easier, while mood and stereotypes still matter the game will help predict results-Can save at Rest Stops inside the Mugen Field-The G-Castle has recieved improvements that would make Flonne proud. The fights are also less random and it's possible to skip them completely inside the Mugen Field (no more hitting a wall if G-Castle growth hasn't kept up with character growth)-Various minor things that mostly speed up battles and grindingBefore trying this game I strongly recommend playing the prequel first though, they barely bother explaining the setting much less introduce old characters. If you don't enjoy the first you most likely won't enjoy this one either, the improvements aren't that major.As for the censored content, I believe there is about two CGs per female character (as well as variations in the scrubbing minigame) that never made it to the western versions (The PS3 US version didn't have them either). While I'm against this kind of nannying it's not going to change my recommendation."
76561198051954480,Recommended,466920,26922661,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Eclair9,Good sequal to the original.  Moe kill system is greatly improved and actually good now.  The new story is OK but a little lazy on the writiers (don't want to go into details to avoid spoilers).
76561198041395160,Recommended,466920,25319465,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,Tarot-Senpai,"First and foremost, I do not condone the censorship at all; I dislike and don't support it just as much as everyone else, but I will not give this game a thumbs-down because they removed a sexy minigame and some CGs. Censorship is awful, but that does not by any means make this a bad game.If you played the first Mugen Souls, this game is a flat out improvement. Without going into too much detail, they made Moe Killing so much easier, improved making planets your peons, added a help menu and made the tutorials a lot easier to read/comprehend, and improved Mugen World a lot. Features new, cute characters and the same peons you grew to love in the first game, I can't recommend this game enough to fans of the series.If you're wanting to try Mugen Souls but are very wary about trying the first game due to its glaring issues, you will probably be a bit lost coming into the second game, but all characters are introduced and the events of the first game are touched in minor detail so you're given a basic knowledge of what's going on. You'll miss out on character development that was offered in the first game, but I wouldn't say you should flat out pass it by if you don't want to play the first.TL;DR: Numerous improvements to various systems, cute characters, and fun sense of humor earn my wholehearted recommendation, despite censorship. If you want to try it, don't let the censorship stop you, you're not missing out on much."

However if you play this game in windowed mode this game crashes... A LOT!  To such a degree that doing a windowed version of this game is rather hard to do.  But overall the main problem is one of the achievements is bugged, AND the last 2 achievements of 'sing it again' and 'But that's absurd' are almost as difficult as the final achievements in the original.  They take significantly less time but they require almost as much grinding.  I'm at 92% for my charm levels and still can't get 'Sing it again'.I will say overall despite this game's final achieves the main and post game story are thoroughly enjoyable.  The same characters are back as well as some new ones.  Bertram's complex with Alys is absolutely hysterical!  And the dlc makes most of the main story a joke if you plan accordingly.This game I easily give a 9/10 for the story, but for completion its a 6/10 due to the amount of hours required."

This game is literally just Phantom Brave, but only terrible. I honestly don't know where to begin. All of the mechanics are just so wonky, and playing it puts me to sleep. Literally. I fell asleep within the first hour of playing the game because I was just that bored. My boyfriend witnessed it first hand.With that said, I'm going back to the GOOD Nippon Ichi games, like Disgaea and Phantom Brave. I don't know what the hell NIS was thinking when they decided to go through with this mess."
