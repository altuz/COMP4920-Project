And yes, early access games update over time, but this game is fully realesed. When you try to click on one of the projects, it'll show you the one beside it. It'll also show you a pop up message when you use the electric ability, and when you try to close it, it keeps poping back up. OVER. AND OVER AGAIN. Uless the fix it, I do not recommened this game!

,Recommended,466940,28344320,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,Lowen,"The artwork, character controls, interface and general stability (on PC) are obviously much better than The Sandbox, but it doesn't quite capture the magic of the past game.In particular the temperature system isn't as well balanced. It's easier to get a runaway temperature reaction (eg dropping one ice in a body of water and forming a glacier). You could do that in the previous game, but the ice was much more likely to melt if you only dropped one, and it was easier to erase all the ice and get your water back. In this game temperature tends to stick around and you typically have to erase a lot of the surrounding solid blocks in order to getnon-freezing temperatures back.It's also a lot less system oriented than the previous game. As an example, lasers in this game are simply 1 block that you place and they work as lasers. There's a block for every different kind of mirror. In the previous game a laser was a laser block, some glass blocks to determine the direction of the laser, (optionally, a gem for different laser effects - no gems in this game yet). Then you placed different kind of mirrors by placing glass blocks in certain patterns.Even so, I love the Sandbox and the Sandbox Evolution is almost as good, so I also love Sandbox Evolution. It still has the temperature, weather and electronics system, in fact most of the systems from the Sandbox are in Evolution."

The previous game - a port from a handheld device - wasn't perfect and there was no real goal, as the moment you booted it up, the player already had everything. The new game has so much more diversity, as the player can build their own levels, pixelart, or just mess about in the sandbox. To be sure, I have came accross a few bugs here and there, but as this game is new, I'm sure the developers will iron them out. It is a good game and worth buying."

It's definitely a step up from the first Sandbox game, and more worth the money you pay for it. However, it's still overpriced and the controls in general are mediocre at best.I'd be able to grudgingly live with the price and the controls, but it has one fatal flaw, which seems to apply only to me but ruined my experience and led to me uninstalling it completely. The game crashed every single time (and yes, I mean every single time) I attempted to open it after the first couple times playing it. The iOS version had this problem for me as well, but I assumed it was just because my iPad is one of the oldest models. My computer, however, is relatively new, so the PC version doesn't have this excuse.If you are considering buying this game, I would suggest passing over it, at least until a sale or the price drops. It really isn't worth the price, and, although I haven't seen anyone else report it, nothing feels worse than a game crashing on you every time you try to play it."

If you burn one of them, others simply don't care. If a wall of lava is flooding the village they are living in, no one gives a damn.If you care about playing with the sandbox, you need to get a currency for unlocking new stuff. The currency is gained by completing levels that are okay - mostly. I bought the game for the sandbox only and I would love to have the option to unlock everything with one click.If the devs are reading this: I'm also missing a way to apply heat or cold on point, just by clicking there.----If you love playing with a sandbox and want to terraform using physics and your inner evil, you will have a lot of fun. However, it doesn't feel like a god game (yet), because the NPC interaction is too limited, which makes everything feel dead and empty in the sandbox."

You use mana to buy ""elements"" to solve puzzles to buy more elements.  Theoretically there is some platforming and some lemmings type stuff.  Theoretically you can build your own levels and games and such.  But I'm having lock up issues with anything past the first tutorial.  So I'm not sure about the rest.  Till I can solve my issues I can not personally recommend T.S.E.  It looks like... well frankly, it looks like I'm glad I got it on sale.  But, as I said, I've only gotten a glimpse.  There's a lot of potential here.  Assuming this mana to purchase elements thing doesn't turn into a ""freemium experience"" I think this might be good.  I'll try to amend this review once I've gotten more of a look,  But for those using Win7 and have a decent but not ""Alienware"" level system... There are some glitches and lockups.  I'd buy this one on sale.  And make sure you don't have problems with it in that first week.v   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -  -   -   -   -   vP.S.  Norton Security does not like this program.  Norton's ""Reputation"" scan will tend to delete things with too few known users.  (They believe in the ""wisdom of the crowds.""  Uh huh.)  Anyway.  Since T.S.E. apparently only has thousands of users, instead of what I'm guessing is a minimum of hundreds of thousands or millions of users, Norton will (On my machine) delete the file before scanning or running it.  You have to tell Norton not to scan the directory to make it work.  Fair warning."

But the problem here was that you had to put it on PC, and the differences you put into it. Let me give you the Pros and Cons.Pros:There's a few things on there which aren't on mobile, example: The Lava Gun.It has raised in popularity ever since then due to it being on steam causing there to be a bigger community.Cons:It isn't as up to date as the mobile version.There's quite a few features on the mobile version which aren't on the PC version, example: Character Skins.There's quite a lot of glitches on the PC version.You start off with all the game modes to create with, which completely ruins the fun of earning it.It gets boring very easily after quite a while as it's not the type of game you'd play on a computer, it's lost all the thrill from all the terrible differences on the Computer version. Honestly, it should have just stayed on mobile, it's the equivalent of having Doodle Jump on Steam, would you play it on your phone if you were bored, sure! But if you were bored and were on your laptop, would you play doodle jump on Steam? Of course not!Last but not least,Would I recommend it?For mobile, yes.But I'm afraid it's a no for this version."

As I have bought the game but still I have to play the levels to unlock lots of elementsThen there are many creation modes, which add different gameplay to this sandbox game and I found them unique.- Sandbox: of course, obviously- make game: this one is pretty unique. I can drop a few platforms, a character like the Ninja, some enemies and I make a plat forming level- music: haven`t yet tried this one but looks nice to make music melodies- pixel art: it makes easy to draw. Their Worlds gallery has tons of amazing examples of pixel art made by other playersThe game offer many more things on pc compare to Smartphone so I would prefer this one"

,Not Recommended,466940,28963080,Posted: 2 January,all,Reth meth,"(Disclaimer; I haven't played a lot of the game)Bought it on sale. controls are wonky, some dont even work.With art:Quest I could not complete was shading, because no matter what ""Press and hold the yellow color"" did not work in any way.When doing casual pixel art myself, the tools got stuck and decided themselves what to colour in. For example the bucket tool would be stuck when trying to use the pen or pencil.Replacing colour tool does not work very well either. replacing colours like grey and black when you set it to only replace black.There's a ton I've missed since I could not get to learn how the system works in all, considering the quest is bugged so I cannot proceed unless I pay for it.-----------Sandbox:Sanbox is alright.The Go back arrow seems to bug aswell because it takes me back to last animation, not the last action. Which pretty much renders it useless if suddenly you accidently turn your black stone into stone.Sometimes things wil bug so it doesnt turn back at all, as if you've done the same action twice in a row.My pick at it is that there isnt a lot in the whole deal and you have to pay for most it even after paying an overpriced game from the start. You need to complete missions etc to gain currency (Im all for missions, no probs. I like the system. But lower the price of the game if you REALLY want to stick with it)The animals cant swim (Other than the fishes).So they'll drown the minute they walk into a lake, which they WILL at all cost unless you block it.The trees are extremely small. All of them. They're the size of tall bushes if anything.Villagers/Humans dont do anything. Just walk around.Not sure if the farmer will do anything since I haven't unlocked him (But I'm guessing all of them are just another skin/outfit)Houses are small. Again the actual NPCs are a head smaller depending what building it is.The dragon npc will destroy everything. mud, grass, stone, everything. Which makes no sense.It targets humans and buildings first, but once they're destroyed in a matter of 2 seconds, it will begin to fire at the actual landscape.Runners:I found the runners fun.The first runner was hard and annoying since you go ALL the way back to the start of the game if you get hit once.the other runners seemed pretty hard aswell, definitely not for just casual drunk playing.Caveman game:I actually enjoyed it. I didnt see much to really hate there other than the fact that you have to be very aware of what's going on in the landscape, because suddenly lava is rising with no music changing or warnings or anything.Sum:It's a nice game. It just needs to fix its bugs because you can definitely feel its a mobile port (Which is unfortunate)Buy it on sale. I bought mine on 75% sale, so I'm not too bothered by the crappy functions.Would I recommend it?Yes. But buy it on high sale."

It features many different ways of playing the game.Graphics are amazing for a pixel game. Overall good, but it needs some updates such as more elements, and more ways of getting karma.
