You drive straight, and in circles, and after 15 minutes can sort out a ""decent"" strategy to drive until the game screws you over. It provides laughs, but you can do the same stuff in Blockland for free.Wait until this game has completed content before purchasing. It has potential. But is empty for now."

It doesn't offer any breathing room to get to know the game or build any thought-out routes. An option to increase the amount of time before exploding or an option to disable it would be great, for those who are still figuring things out. Otherwise I'll keep an eye on this game for a while"

It's a wonderfully chaotic blend of styles that I've never played before.

,Not Recommended,466980,29209618,Posted: 12 January,all,//ap_lis,"Good idea, but that is all the advantages of this game.With the game on the network, not on the local machine, it does not prevent the separation of the screen into 2 parts.There are a constant ""out of syncs"", not appearing blocks that builds comrade, the car blows up when the danger scale still have some place inside. The game was bought to play on the network - as a result it is impossible to do."

You've done it all and it is neither challenging nor rewarding.Don't want me to bad talk something because it is 'early access'? Don't release something 'early access' that's bad."

,Recommended,466980,33870486,Posted: 28 July,all,The Awesome Ocelot [CBLT],"This game has great potential, but it has no playerbase. I am recommending it on the fact that is is indeed a great concept, but just needs to grow before it is any good. I spent a fair ammount of time searching for another player, wasting time.  Once it grows, however, it will be a lot of fun. If you want to play, you may want to find a few friends to buy it as well, as so that you are more likely to have someone to play with. That said, it does indeed get boring after playing for a while. All in all; good concept, good execution, ruined by lack of other players."

From my limited attempts, there are too few people playing the game online to find someone to play with. I tried 5 different occassions on both maps and was unable to find someone to play with.On the positive side, if you have a controller you can do the ""hot seat"" single player where one person with the keyboard/mouse creates the course as the other person drives.I bought this mainly to support the penguins, it was a good idea from the devs!"

It looked pretty good and I loved the concept - one person builds the track while the other person drives at the same time!It IS pretty fun, at least for a short while but it seems a bit buggy, although it might've been because of the higher ping me and Jake share.

The only thing missing is content but I do believe that will come with time. The game is just loads of fun to play local and even though it might need some tweeks (aerial control is still kind of awkward and the hitboxes feel a little off) this is what early access should be! this is the type of game that can actually fit go early access! Thank you!I seriously recommend you to buy this if you like to play locally with your friends. I do and was waiting for a title like this for a long time.Simple yet fresh.
,Recommended,466980,25801969,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Poob!,"Great fun. Latency will mess with you pretty often. I'm playing on 150+ mbps and it's an issue. When it's working it's an absolute joy. Right now it seems about 50/50 if skill or latency will get you. I describe this as an arcade driving roguelike where the generation is played by a frenemy.When you get on a good run it is gaming bliss. Latency will make you salty, the flipping that activates on your car will drive you nuts. This needs a button to activate it (trigger?) so you dont just end up inadventedly front flipping. That or just make accelerate and steering not on the same joystick.It's got it's issues but local or online with friends it's quite rewarding. If you go looking for things to hate you'll find them. Try to find what you enjoy instead, there is a lot of that here.There seems to be one hell of a bug that double places blocks disabling the placement of further blocks. Haven't seen if this is something that occurs on the local as well. Also, the physics calculations can vary wildly from one persons perspective to the other, leading the building player to believe someone is further/shorter/in the air/in the water/alive/dead.Definitely bugs throughout, but the times when it works flawlessly makes me forget about that. Runs take only a short period of time anyway. Again, it's about 50/50 between killed by skill/reaction time and killed by latency or physics calculated differently between users.I'd love to see more tilesets/game modes, as well as more cars. Power-ups would be welcome here. Block varieties with things like banked corners and multi level blocks and crossing trafficked highways etc etc. More zaz basically.It's cheap. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. If I stop playing it tomorrow it'll have been worth my time.Play Everything"
