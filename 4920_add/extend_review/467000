I had loss of frames and lagging in different parts of the game and cutscenes are just as you see in my recordings (link below) - not a very pleasant thing for the eye. Texture and models are what they are too, but that's not a big deal.There is no settings' menu, so you can't adjust graphic, sound and key bindings in game but devs wrote a post in discussion forums about that: i.e. it's still possible to change resolution and keys by editing the setup.ini file in game dir.http://steamcommunity.com/app/467000/discussions/0/357286532030856073/I really spent some good hours playing, recording and editing my gameplay and I feel like recommending ""Insincere"" to adult gamers like myself.If you're interested in the game, you can take a peek at or even watch my full playthrough on YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LNeR8yw8vo&list=PLePnXvVxuuX9T9tJQT6JkQhK-TpnN9ENH"

All in all, its a good game and such; but really I have a large fancy for old games or seemingly-old games. The voice acting is a bit off, and the fact you can't change the control scheme is a bit aggrivating; as with ""Enter"" to use, and ""T"" to pick up weapon.But man, I did enjoy that sweet Candy Apple Glock skin.Would I reccomend?Well hell no unless you appreciate all works of games, or just want to look at the sweet sight of a Candy Apple CS:GO skin without paying $0.42 in level 2."

I loved the game despite numerous flaws that I best start upon,- ENTER is used to open doors and pull switches on and while caught by the action we would asume something might jump on us while having one or the other hand midway of their usual position.- Sadly it crashed at almost each 4 levels.  Fortunately, saving a lot is helpful there.- Reloading a game is a bit long and sometimes at scene changes we get damage and we always return with the lead pipe as weapon.  Nothing to really hate the gameplay, but it kinda not reassure us about the stability of the game.- The voice acting got a bit chopped in the cutscene and I'm happy it rolled in chopped slow-motion to read what was stuttered before about 4 sentences later.  It however didn't happened systematially but froze my game about twice!- I got cornered by mobs from behind that hinderd my character to move or shoot!- Some of the ennemies just looks like your ally... (Maybe it is a plot twist)The goods,- The developper of Astronomic Games specialise in story heavy and tactic heavy RPG and that was what got attempted here on an engine that is NOT made to be cooperative for that type of use (Read above also how just cooperative is the engine in short.) and really shown a lot of hardwork to just get his vision trough.- For the very little we can use of the voiced charaters in a shooter environement, we got very nicely around them and intrigued to continue the game. (At the exeption that it took me two floors to realize the AI wasn't talking to me when I heard a guard or two warn me someone was close!)- I got trapped in a logic map near the end trying to grenade every wall apart... So in about 3 floors you get to puzzle your way a bit and same with 3 or 4 tactical traps.- I would had LOVED to bring back all enrolled bots with my charater because well... :DSome things to think about if this is first chapter,When the story ends as not really an end, there are still loose ends around.  Was really the AI helping the guy?  How/why did he made such a mess?  If in the end we have the answer of what he might be, why wasn<t he be more honnest with himself?  What really served all that secrecy purpose with the AI?  Why monsters?  What is that facility all about anyway?So I know it is hard to dose a shooter as a RPG but when finishing a chapter before introducing new elements especially when it is unsure folks will return back, please... No loose ends!It is a very good game in a bundle to spend, waste half a day on it!  Sorry Matt, but I would get this in a bundle only and, if possible in its very own bundle beause so many questions!  (This could had been so much fun in a Mass Effet/FallOut 3 engine! Just grabbing stuff getting notes menus and options... You know.)"

I liked them, Put together with comical dying poses, Enemies getting stuck with their heads through walls, Various bugs and a great soundtrack, It took me back to my first gaming experiences, Playing on a SNES or an N64, Where nobody cared about any of that stuff, Nobody complained about the graphics, or the bugs. They just played the game and got on with it.Now, There are a few things that could be improved, For example:There is NO autosave. Now, me being a dumbass forgot about that, and went through half the game only for it to crash and force me to start over.There are no options whatsoever. You get what you're given, There's no settings to change.The game crashes quite often, For me it crashed 6 times before i finished the game.The game is fairly short. I happened to get really into the game, only for it to end abruptlyIt's quite easy, I made it through the entire game having only died once, and even that was because i made a mistake, as opposed to enemy difficulty.Despite the above, I really did enjoy this game, It took me back to my childhood. And sure, it doesn't have trading cards or achievements, But who needs those when you have a game as good as this!I highly recommend playing this, It's short, sweet, and worth the time! (In my opinion)8/10"

On headphones this means I heard an enemy snarl on my right ear only when it was right in front of me. I can't hear my gunshots or if I actually hit the enemy. But I do hear that I'm hurt.- The attack distance of the melee-Enemies you encounter right from the start seems off. It feels like they have arms longer than rendered and can attack you from a distance way too far away. This is only a minor thing though, since it just affects the difficulty of the game- I stopped playing on the fourth level or so, because an enemy pushed me through the wall into the void, effectively killing me.- After I died, I had to restart entirely, because the game does not save automatically for you. Not even upon reloading new levels. I know this was rather common back in the day, but being used to modern game mechanics it is something that should be indicated to new players.To sum it up:- Bad controls- Misleading sound rendering- Strange melee distances- Clipping errors lead to insta-death- No Auto-Save"

,Not Recommended,467000,31777139,Posted: 15 May,all,Verdantil,"Tags: 1PS - First Person ShooterAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Servicable game, unstable, does not shine in any area. Did not finish playthrough due to wiped out progress. Many technical problems detract from the experience. Game best avoided.Review: Game is very unstable, risking wiping your progress if you do not save regularly. I am a huge fan of System Shock 2 so I was very welcoming of a new take on the classic formula. However this one has too many issues, and does not reward you with enough of the good stuff to warrant the pain of going through it. Most of the levels are fairly empty. you go down linear-style until there is a branching path, at the end of each branch is a switch. You activate those and can keep progressing forward. Rinse and repeat.The music is good and the voice acting is mediocre. The premise is cliche and a lot like system shock series. Wake up amnesiac in a deserted sci fi facility of some kind, with hybrids attacking you and eventually soldiers that might be clones of yourself. Be guided around by an A.I. Xerxes type figure. There are no audio logs, or computers or any other narrative delivery device other than cutscenes between levels involving conversation between you and the A.I.The whole thing stays cryptic on purpose, but rather than keep you guessing it feels like there is just nothing there because the dev did not implement it in. I got about halfway through the game using only the handgun before I lost all my progress. But the game gradually introduces a good variety of weapons.The A.I. of the ennemies is very unpolished, mostly spawning near you charging you, or standing in one place until shot at. NPCS can not go down stairs and will start walking in mid air if they approach a staircase.People who got to the ending seem to imply that a lot is  left unexplained or unadressed and the developper commented that he initially thought he would make a second part to the game as a sequel but decided against it due to the negative reception. Given that this title has not received the attention it needed to shine I can only agree with the dev's decision to pull out seems like he moved on to the RPGMaker engine since."

No menu of options, neither video nor audio, in fact, the game begins with a very low resolution, with an elevated high sensitivity of the mouse, which can not be changed in the game ever! The part of the game graphics is lower than that of a title of 1998/2000, with ultra-low density shapes of polygons. Animations and ""animated figures' movements are done very badly and with obvious poor care, as well as weapons, have several shortcomings, such as the ability to upload a 'already loaded weapon, and' almost total lack of precision during the shot, the shots seem to go almost completely at random within 2 meters in the game. the 'gaming environment is repetitive in many ways, weaving, weapons and doors have no variables except the color. the price is objectively too high for sold content."

Lighting was great, and I didn;t encounter any bugs. 100% solid scifi shooter, Would have liked a little more back story but cutscenes were decent useing ingame graphics as not to break the visual emersion. SOme of the voice acting was a little flat, primarily from the protagonist but I did enjoy the heads up when a guard would sense me near. Some custom models would have done this game well but I can't complain too much as what was there was placed well. My final thoughts - bigger and more would make this have a bit more shine.
