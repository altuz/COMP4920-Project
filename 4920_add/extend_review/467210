,Recommended,467210,35031153,Posted: 17 September,all,Helevorn,"A very nice little game, with plenty of optical illusions (with brilliant artworks!) and a bunch of levels and difficulty tiers. It's not short, and quite challenging!When I review games on Steam I seldom make -comparations- with other Flash/free/Kongregate games, but I still think that one can not say (as other reviewers do) just like ""this is a copy of that game"". If this game is beautiful and it's not, of course, an illegal plagiarism, I rate this one and if you want to go on Kongregate (where I'm at an insane level and have been playing there since 10 years btw XD) and play the other one you're free to do it, but I don't think that this could be a reason to downgrade the Steam game.Even because as I was saying there are of course many optical illusions/puzzles/find-the-path games, but this one is unique and doesn't plagiarize anything.If you can get this one maybe on discount it's relaxing and worth the price :)"
,Recommended,467210,24247363,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,BlueDahlia,"This game caught my eye from the Steam store because the artstyle looked a lot like Monument Valley, the mobile game. I figured this would be from the same developers since the style is unmistakeable. So I first looked into the game and devs before I purchased, but it's not the same devs. However, after reading from the devs who made Evo Explores, they were inspired by Monument Valley for this game, which is pretty clear.If you've previously played through Monument Valley on mobile, then you will feel like you're playing through it again when playing Evo Explores. The only difference here is the main character, your ""companion"" that helps you through some levels to complete puzzles, and the storyline was written a bit differently to make more sense with the characters.It's hard not to recommend this game, because I really like the puzzles it offers. So despite it being very similar to the experience you get from Monument Valley, I would recommend it for fans of MV who wants to play through similar puzzles and anyone who hasn't had the experience of it before, since MV is a mobile only game and this one was introduced to PC players. I look forward to seeing what the devs do with Evo Explores 2, which appears to be under development right now according to the devs Twitter."

The puzzles (so far - world 4) are relatively easy and aren't fustrating to figure out. But it is still fun, it isn't boringly easy. It's tricky enough to provide some relaxed entertainment, great game for the price as well. Also the main robot guy is super cute and there is a little story that goes on to.The only annoying part is the tutorial/guide goes on a little to long. I thought it was going to go on for the whole game, which thankfully it didn't. I don't click anything for 3 seconds and it starts showing me what to do. Telling you where to click for an entire level was off putting beause I just wanted to figure it out myself."

,Recommended,467210,23023932,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,Ouroboros,Very relaxing puzzle game that plays with perspective and the laws of physics. Its like navigating around an MC Escher drawing that you can rotate and manipulate. It is very much like Monument Valley for Android or iOS. I really enjoyed that game and played through all the available levels they put out. Finally I get a similar game play and aesthetic from this game with some new twists. Definitely worth the 2 dollars.

This game was no exception.It had a beautiful and simple aesthetic, and was quite colorful.  The sound/music (mostly an ambient, atmospheric humming sort of sound), didn't distract from the puzzles, and sounded excellent.  Thankfully, the character's walking pace was quite quick.The character is controlled simply by clicking where you wish to go.The puzzles were, on the whole pretty good.  Sometimes the amount of things that were moving when rotated things was a bit much, however.  Occasionally, the puzzles felt as though I just solved them by trying a bunch of different things out.  Also, sometimes the puzzles hold your hand a bit, which can be either good or bad, depending on the difficulty and your prowess at this game.After completing a majority of the levels, I found myself just grinning at the overall cleverness of the level.  Most of the puzzles were satisfying to solve.Overall, this was a great game, and I'm glad I impulse bought it! :D"

It's easier to say that it kinda rips off M.V. in many ways, but with much less 'Escher'.  There are a few unique ideas, but most folks will be marching right through the puzzles in no time, with very few hangups.  My play time of 1.3 hours included beating it plus folding 3 loads of laundry.Is it worth the 2 bucks?  I think so.  Is it spectacular?  No, it's 2 bucks."

I' glad I was very wrong.The comparison goes deeper than the graphical style and puzzle-types, though.+ It's also quite short (took me a few hours because I was cooking and eating dinner at the time - nom.)+ It's also cheap; cheaper than MV.+ It's also got some truely head-hurting puzzles. Not in completing them; you can usually get by by just trying things and seeing what happens. The most you'll need to deviate from that is to look at where youwantto be, and then work backwards to see how you can get there.No; the head-hurtingness comes in trying to work out how onEarththey think these kind of things up! Even the simpler puzzles are sometime quite surprising and almost mesmerizing as you watch things unfold.+ It's also got 'additional cast' although I'm not sure much of their potential is realised. (So far?)All in all, a very pleasant little journey through some impossible physics and optical tomfoolery of puzzles.There are a few negatives;- I didn't personnaly find the story very captivating. Predictable and just a little bit preachy.- The ideas tended to be reused rather too much in the second half, which was a shame given the very strong beginning.- Controlling the circular motion bits often seemed a little wonky - but maybe that's just me.Small criticism, really, and I'm definitely looking forward to see what happens in the next installments.If in doubt, there are twoBIGplusses of this (on Steam) over MV;+ You can play it with a mouse. Despite the circular control thing, this is way more precise and comfortable.+ You can play it at 2560x1440 with full AA on a 28"" monitor. (If you have the hardware.) Retina display? Phah!"

Finally got them :) I completed the game quickly because Monument Valley is one of my favorite mobile games and since this game is similar to MV, I knew exactly what to expect. But if you're not used to this type of puzzle games, I'm sure you'll spend a good 2-3 hours of immersive thinking and planning.I must admit, this game is not as good as Monument Valley when it comes to sound and ambience. But having said that, I enjoyed this game tremendously, the game narrative was interesting as well, and there were also a couple of new puzzle types that aren't there in MV. Kudos to the dev for the creativity. I bought it on sale, but even without the discount, I think it is worth buying it (not to mention that MV is twice the cost of this game, that too on mobile platforms)."

But still there are more advantages and the price was great.All in all the gameplay and artstyle is very similar to monument valley and for me this was the main selling point. If you want to play a game like monument valley and finished it already or don't have a phone with monument valley and want the experience: this is the game to go. Sadly the ""flow"" of the puzzles is not as interesting in the long run and the story, following similar ideas, is not presented in a touching way and feels weird and full of personal opinions the creator wants to ""teach"" the player. These are a few ""bad points"" which reduced the enjoyment of the game. But as a short ""small"" monument valley like experience for a small price it is amazing ist flaws. I can recommend it to everybody who is in light and creative puzzle games."
