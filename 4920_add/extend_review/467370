The game itself, the idea is good and it's fun to play for a moment, but it gets boring very easily. It could have more levels in it, it really doesnt take long to finnish all of them. This is one of those easy and relaxing games that you don't have to put much effort in. I mean this is not bad, but it could have something more in to it, not bad for a small 0.99 euro game. My grade for this game 5,5/10"

Tho it looked ugly the dev was reacting fast and polished up graphics quickly. Way more to come. Also awaiting more community generated content. Because of the simple level exchange atm (in form of txt files, easy to copy content into a discussion thread). Also I'm excited about further development and will keep an eye on it. Surely the 5 easy achievements are a dooropener to take a closer look . Hopefully more will come ..."

I am actully excited to see how much it improves!!Edited: I read the updates after playing this game and since there will be no further major updates, I can NOT recommend this game to anyone, ever, it is UNFINISHED, and far to badly made to be called a final build, or a final anyting. it did have the ability to be good.So this is the story of Rick, the blue cube...Every morning Rick wakes up in a different room full of traps... and all Rick wants to do is get to the green bathroom... but no matter how many times he goes in there... he somehow starts in another trapped room with a bathroom at the end...With the endless addicting music that plays with an uncontrollable volume... He makes his never ending adventure through this rooms of death... Will Rick ever make it to the bathroom? Will Rick ever see his family of little cubes again? Does this game have a beginning or end?No. He he died... from his bladder exploding...Okay if you want the real review it is below here, I had to make up something because there is nothing behind this game to drag you in.I purchased this game after the publisher contacted me about someone trying to scam a free copy from him by impersonating me (I do not know why me but meh).This is my first experience with the gamehttps://youtu.be/TVw_HaR5BHsThe Game is just a simplistic puzzle game where you get the block from point A to point B while avoiding pitfalls, block shooting lasers, crushing blocks. spinning blocks, pit stabby blocks... okay, you avoid blocks, I really did not understand what kills you because I got hit... sometimes I died... sometimes I didn't which made tactics and stuff different because it was a chance if they killed you. The music was 1 track that had a beginning and an end but was catchy. I couldn't play all of the maps they randomly sent me to different maps and sometimes the same map, I played for well over an hour and saw very few maps. So I do hope this isn't a final product because it is promising. So here are the Pros and consPROS- A promising puzzler- Has a lot of potential- Cube is now named Rick- Full achievements in 5 secondsCons- menu is ugly- no volume sound control- no order to the puzzles, (you randomly get another map and sometimes the same)- unable to access maps showed on store page- Multiplayer does NOTHING just starts loads you in- the whole thing is a slapped together messI would like to say I recommend this game, I had fun, irritation and determination for this game, but after I made a tactic for every map I found I then concluded my adventures, and for 99 cents I feel like I completed it. This game has potential, it could be a great puzzle game if it gets expanded on, more puzzles, clean it up(volume controls and stage selection with maybe timers scores or just something to aim for). it looks like it has an editor if they provide instructions making puzzles for friends would be kind of fun,All in all as it stands now, this game should NOT be a final build, it should be worked on and changed back to early access or beta. I really do hope to see this game evolve into an awesome puzzler it COULD be."

76561198091903745,Recommended,467370,25669379,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,BoogieManJapan,"This game had me collect all the achievements in less than 2 minutes, I had to play some more to even write the review....I like the concept of guiding my cube through a maze of obstacles  (anyone remember rock-n-roll?)  Get it on sale if you can, and try it out. It ain't pretty on the eyes, but the gameplay is nice for killing some time."
,Not Recommended,467370,28923303,Posted: 1 January,all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","Yet another dull, poorly made game on the road to completionist prestige. If you're not here to find easy, inexpensive 100% games, you honestly should not be here at all. This game has poor physics, a horrible soundtrack, and unimaginative achievements.RNG difficulty curve is idiotic, the first level set starts you off easy, you avoid a rotating block with arms. The next level is either randomly generated, or shuffled, mine required me to use pinpoint accuracy as I guided my square through lava, but the thing is, if a corner even feels the heat of the lava, doesn't even have to touch it, you have to go back to the start. Right off the bat you're thrown into a game that feels unpolished, unplayable, and just downright annoying. Play it to get your achievements, then get the hell out. It's up to you if you want to get a refund on this poorly made piece of crap."

I got all in less than 5 minutes!I don`t know if i should reccommend this game or not. But i guess some people may enjoy it. I did not!
