,Recommended,467380,30047090,Posted: 19 February,all,Audish,"It's pretty amazing to me the kinds of games you can find for free. I don't know how it happens but some developers seem perfectly content to make something amazing and just give it away. That's certainly how I felt about Khimera, because the whole time I was playing it I was comparing it in my head to Shovel Knight. That should be pretty high praise, I think, but the comparisons aren't entirely positive.On a remote island of monsters, a bunch of monster pirates haul off and steal all the money from town. The local maddish scientist lets his latest creation, a chimera girl with a big funky stone arm, run off to stop them before they abscond with the loot. That gives you a whole island of tricky levels to tackle, with trips back to Mr. Science to turn boss monster DNA into a new power for your patchwork body. There's also loot to score, fairies to free, trades to make, costumes to unlock, and a whole mess of chatty NPCs to get friendly with.If this sounds like a load of content for a free title then your head's in the right place. Khimera is a full, feature-rich game that can keep you occupied for hours. While the levels aren't quite as long or numerous as something like Shovel Knight they hide a TON of secrets, and you'll need to do plenty of backtracking and experimenting with new powers if you want to unearth the many kooky sidequests hidden in the villages. Your efforts are rewarded with additional powers, costumes, and most importantly, charming dialogue from the island's colorful inhabitants. While there's a bit of internet humor that's certainly going to date it in a few years, most of the text in Khimera is plenty funny and keeps me going to meet more of the cast.Luckily the gameplay is able to keep up with the content, featuring some quality retro platforming across plenty of challenging levels. I know I can't shut up about Shovel Knight but that is absolutely the closest thing to Khimera in terms of challenge and level layout. Every stage has plenty of enemies, pits, spikes, and secrets to deal with, and while Khimera never gets as creative with its gimmicks as Shovel Knight it makes up for it with multiple paths through levels. The powers you get from bosses makes platforming a real joy here, starting with a versatile dash attack and expanding to winged double-jumps and shocking ground-pounds.I mentioned the challenge being similar because it is, though it might stray a little too far on the side of frustration. Checkpoints are sometimes sparse between difficult sections, with the hardest jumps and maneuvers coming at the very end of a sequence. The spikes are happily not instant death but they will mess you up plenty with how abundant and lethal they are, and every bottomless pit is a significant threat. Interestingly the enemies and bosses are probably the least dangerous part of the game, thanks mainly to your powerful dash attack that makes you invincible for several frames. In fact, many of the bosses can be offed by just smashing into them over and over.The net result is an excellent retro platformer that'll take you upwards of two hours to beat, and plenty more if you go secret hunting. The graphics are finely detailed in their pixel style, though levels tend to have kinda bland tile repetition. Sound design is definitely more up to the task with memorable tunes and familiar-feeling effects. If this were a paid product I would have no problem at all recommending Khimera, so as a free game I feel justified in ridiculing you if you don't give it a go.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

Harder than mario, with an upgrade system reminescant of Megaman. Plenty of enemy types with unique attack patterns and damage outputs and collectibles to test your dilligence. At no point in the game do you feel like there is an enemy type that is just a reskin of a previous. A basic plot that doesn't seem to overbearing or ridiculuos. Great replayability due to how you can complete the entire game without using your power ups or upgrades at all. The only real problem I saw with the game was the large learning curve you have to get used to, as the maps can be extremely unforgiving. Overall I'd give this game a 8/10."

The dialogue is great, all the sprites are absolutely adorable and the gameplay is top. Not an easy game, but if you like platformers, this is the game for you. It shoud really be worth $10-15+ on steam, I have no idea why it's free to play??M O N S T E R   G I R L S <3"

FREE?????(game is totally free) though to be completely honest, you cant proceed past a certain point without buying the dlc, the maid outfit is a must buy due to your conscience.

I had such a blast playing it, and I can't wait to see the sequel!This game could have easily charged money, and it would have been right to do so. It's a quality game, and for free at that! Definitely recommend."
,Recommended,467380,29436493,Posted: 22 January,all,Here4thePIZZA,"I suck at keyboard controls so I was excited to play this game when I finally got my controller. It's aggravating! The ledges are too far from each other. I can't jump that far. also I found areas that there was no way to avoid spikes bc you had to go left on the platform so you can't use the speed thing and there wasn't room to jump. Darn, it was really cute too"

,Recommended,467380,29532805,Posted: 27 January,all,Nirriti,"Pixel platformer with really cute characters(NPCs).Varied facial expressions makes it more alive too. Really like the main character's design ^^ Change your clothing set (5-6 choices to discover) and learn new moves along the way. Some secrets here and there scattered through the levels. Boss fights are fun and varied. On the flipside, the platforming can get brutal in a few places and leave you to lose all of your hard earned gold ($) pretty easily. Expect to be redoing some parts over-and-over until you reach the next checkpoint. It can get frustrating - personally I'll move on to something else.But remember this: it's FREE!If the artstyle appeals to you, try it out!"

,Not Recommended,467380,29582905,Posted: 30 January,all,Max Power,"It's like a poor man's blend of Shovel Knight and Shantae.The punching feels weak and lacks any good of impact, plus the weak and strong punch play out exactly the same. You don't have to be a genius to realize that a strong punch is supposed to *feel* stronger than a weak punch, plus it seems rather unnecessary for it to be on its own separate button when you could've just made the punch chargeable. Aside from that, the controls are kinda slippery. It lacks the tightness of a good platformer like Shovel Knight. That'd be alright if the game was designed around this fact but it seriously expects you to get unto narrow platforms with these ♥♥♥♥ing controls. Hell, even the controls for the map are slippery, and that's so baffling to me that it's unreal. I have no idea how anybody could ♥♥♥♥ up the controls for a goddamn map.The level design starts off alright but takes a dive after just the first level.♥♥♥♥♥♥gets way too hard way too quick, and not in a fun or fair way either. Sometimes you think you're stuck but you just gotta do a move to continue that wasn't explained before. You'd think the tutorial level would explain that *BUT NO*. There's not even a button prompt, instead you're expected to learn from TALKING TO THE CHECKPOINTS. Who'd even think of doing that? Who would even think of designing it like this where you have to learn about crucial moves from ♥♥♥♥ing checkpoints instead of showing me I have that move in the tutorial level?? That's what tutorial levels are ♥♥♥♥ing for!The art is crude and unappealing. The characters look like they were done quickly in MS Paint and the animation is just bad. The tilesets and backgrounds are nothing special but sometimes,  there are foreground objects that look like they're just for scenery when they're actually solid!! This was especially egregious in the airship level where I fell into a pit because I assumed that  I could go through a grey thing when every other grey thing in the level wasn't solid, but no actually, this one grey thing is solid. And right above a bottomless pit too just to rub it in some more. That's game design 101: make the foreground and the scenery ♥♥♥♥ing distinct from each other.The music is alright and the sound effects were made in that totally retro Flash generator that every indie dev that has no shame uses. That's all there is to say about the audio.On the whole, even if you really like platformers and Monster Girls, don't bother. It's a poorly designed platformer with slippery controls, frustrating level design and bad art."

A lot of work must have gone into this because the gaameplay is fantastic(may have a few complaints but that's for another time), the plot is fairly simple and the dialog is fun and nice.the whole atmosphere of the game is really nice overall and has a cute retro aesthetic(a few notes like how the dialog box icons match up way too much with a regular sprite). Defeating a level feels really satisfying, and so does finding the secret items!Overall would reccomend."

The graphics, the character design, the stages, the mechanics, etc. There is not reason to no play it unless you no like platforming games.If I have a complaint about the game it would be the Steam banner because in my opinion it is very misleading about the quality of the game at simple sight.Recommendable."

,Recommended,467380,29995995,Posted: 17 February,all,Moro,"Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an action platform game inspired by classics like Megaman and (mainly) Shovel Knight. You control a chimera of some sort who's after the leaders of a pirate monster girl squad that plots to steal all of your island's precious resources.Venturing through thematic stages, you fight mobs and move through agility-based challenges until you finally meet a boss. After that, you get a special power based on the boss' own skills, and you move to the next stage you want to face.Like Shovel Knight, the main screen is a map of the areas you can go. Some are the normal stages, some are optional stages that you have to unlock, and some are just places where you can meet NPCs.The art is great, the music is fun, the gameplay is solid, the level design is smart and everything feats a charming tongue in cheek vibe. It also has tons of collectibles to find and challenges to beat, if you're into that stuff. I am.The game has a soul of its own. I really can't believe it's free. I bought the DLC just so I could give the devs a little money.If you like Megaman and Shovel Knight, give Khimera a try."
