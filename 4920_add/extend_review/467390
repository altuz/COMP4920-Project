No sad this is not worth even the sales price I paid of 1.97$ CAD

There are also other dictionaries of English/German and English/French. But unfortunately the quizes are only in Russian/English and Russian/French. First you playthrough the game. Means survive 100 secs in each of the 5 stages. Quite easy I think. Then you can activate the Quiz mode. After each death you have a 4 answers multiple choice test of understanding a sentence - only in Russian. Try your luck or just choose the 1st answer 300 times. Then you'll have only one problem left: To give 10 right answers in a row ..."

,Not Recommended,467390,26138246,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,ed209,"Been there, done that.. albeit 25 years ago and those games were much better. As shallow as as they come, but the biggest problem here is that the game is not fun - it is frustrating and annoying from the moment you start playing. Frustrating because the controls are clunky and collision has minus room for error. Annoying because the ""cluster-****"" music blares in your face while you repeatedly hit pixels you'd swear you would miss... The fact you cannot rotate with the landscape is a poor design choice.. the ""language learner"" is utterly pointless and quite frankly - bizarre. Avoid."

I wouldnt pay the whole two dollars though. This game is like an early appstore game, nice menus, graphics that consist of mainly rectangles, and decent music that still sounds like they took it from something else. Its decent overall, as far as my 20 cents goes anyways.Also, I really dont get the whole language thing here. It it not built into the gameplay,instead its like a flashcard that appears between rounds. Im not complaining about it, but I have to wonder why it is there in the first place because of how minnimal it is. Also, given the broken english of the steam page + achievements, I'd be highly skeptical of the translations quality.there is so little to say about this game..."

,Not Recommended,467390,29847057,Posted: 11 February,all,Natsur,"Approaching Blocks is a nice little game for inbetween.The music is good, it's kinda trippy but that's it.There is no real variety in the different levels despite new elements being added.Controlling is quite hard because of the constant level twisting, but you get used to it.I couldn't quite get behind the ""learn a language"" thingy after each level.I can't recommend it for 1,99€ (Steam Store) but I didn't regret the 50 Cent I paid for it using a coupon."

I am terrible with moving my fingers on any keyboard, but i felt like finishing level 1 is impossible. I still haven't finished it. Having only 5 levels is also very strange. If have amazing fingers and you fininshed it, then what? These sort of games I love but this one was not for me. Hope this helps."

This game will be perfect only if the developer(s) configured the controls properly to match the game. It really is challenging trying to use the arrows to control in a fast environment. The music is probably the only reason why I would recommend this game.
