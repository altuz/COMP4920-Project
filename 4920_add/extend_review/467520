You seek to either remain in power or take power of your country. How you do that is your decision, and boy howdy do you have LOTS of decisions.The game, first off, feels really cheap. I don't mean in love from the creators, but in the UI interface (Mispellings/mistranslations, Menu's disappearing or appearing out of nowhere) as well as the voice acting (Which is ironically a plus, as one of the advisors sounded just like Optimus Prime). In all honesty, charging 50 bucks for this is really asking a LOT, and once you go through the start menu, you feel like you made a big mistake.Once you get through that, you have three options to start with: Already be in power of a country, be a democratic opponent of a power, or be a resistance group (AKA terrorist group) of a country and try to set it free. I first tried to be a terrorist group in North Korea, and the key to success is courting and schedualing as many diplomats, terrorists as well as associations in the country and finding ways to get money, weapons as well as support for international interference. The best way to describe it is a cheap dating sim, but the balance of your group could hang in the balance.The second time, I became the leader of the United States, and since I was NK crazy, I attempted to make myself the dictator of the USA. And this is where the game shines: simulating the entire world going crazy. Riots begin to happen, diplomats and head's of state question and put down my decision to have a statue of me in every classroom. It progressed from simple riots to outright terrorism acts and my cabinet demanding I change it or resign.WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME: NOThis game is charming and obviously has a great frame to hang itself on, but the price is just too high for something this cheap...If it were cheaper, heck yeah I would be saying buy it! It has a great amount of charm in it, as well as a interesting representation of discord and anarchy that hasn't been tried by a lot of Global Political simulators.SUGGESTION FOR DEVS:Lower the price or make the UI a lot cleaner and flashy. RIght now it just looks like an Alpha instead of a finished product."

But that's as close as it gets to good, in my opinion.The game feels unintuitive and the tutorial feels like it was given up on halfway though and they said, ""♥♥♥♥ it, just slap the end right on there.""I really, really wanted this game to be better, but it's just such a mess. This, by the way, comes from someone who plays Dwarf Fortress on a regular basis. Where it is now, I'd say the game is worth no more than nine hard earned dollars. Or maybe, like, nine you found on the ground. And the only reason I give it that much is because I played an hour of it before I realized how disappointed I was, and I get paid $9/hour. It seems like it could have a few diamonds in that rough, but definitely not $50 worth."

Game play itself is nothing short of extremely flawed as well.  Decisions sometimes have an impact, while other times they have 0 impact when they should.At best, this is worth $10."

There is no excuse in 2017 for a game this simple to perform this poorly. And the real eye gouger is it's pricetag. It's priced up there alongside AAA games which is by itself misleading. If it were a $10 game(Which it should be) I wouldn't complain. But we are 3 or 4 title releases into this franchise with next to zero improvements. Hell they don't even have a proper forum to discuss the issues and development progress. No troubleshooting, no Q&A, no nothin'. Clearly their passion is not gaming. It's counting money. They can count me out."
76561198007761167,Recommended,467520,23226519,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,geozero,"Continues the game system series.I played a country as a revolutionary, started raising rebels, obtained rockets and made a few international connections. That was pretty cool.  But my popularity and that of my opponent were the same.   I could not get any unions or anyone to do demonstrations.   They just would not.  Perhaps they were content.Finally I decided to just attack with the 10k soldiers and 2k rockets I had.  I did not have aircraft, ships or tanks.  YET, I was able to attack the capital, destroyed many of the enemy tank units, and captured key places and stormed the capital's bunker.   Not a single aircraft came to attack me.  It was a walk in the park.Then I was the new head of government and popularity actually went up.But that is where I got stuck again.   Not a single person, not even family would join my government cabinet.  I made reforms, lowered taxes, and yet kept losing popularity.  Then an ""advisor"" asked to setup the cabinet members for me.  I agreed.  Stupid.   The advisor basically stabbed me in the back, had me executed and took power in a coup.That quickly (2.5 hours) I went from a rebel, to a country leader, to basically dead in a coup.  I lost the game.The whole thing was fun... but confusing.  I don't know where I went wrong.   And that is a big issue with a big game like this.  If you like detail this game has it.   But if you start a rebel and cannot setup govt.  cabinet you will not be able to get far.  You can't run a country by yourself.EDIT: I still like the game for what it is supposed to be and what it promises to do, BUT, Maybe the speed of the game is too slow... and as a player I am impatient.  When you do get to bribe someone or outright ask for money you have about a 25% chance or less of getting some money, but it appears to be a one time donation and if you ask again you get turned down.  Not sure why there is not enough game feedback.As a revolutionary I want to see more choices.  Why can't I assasinate opposition leaders or a trade union boss that would not help me?  Why can't I start a small rebel uprising on the main map in the rural areas or attack infrstructure?  Why can't I be given more choices about cities to attack... most smaller third world countries with more than one city you cannot attack anything other than the capital (Honduras for example).Almost every leader is willing to introduce you to someone else BUT once you do get power they won't talk to you.Granted I played a few months only of the game in moderate speed and sometimes skipping a day or two.  Perhaps we have to wait longer to get more choices???  In about 2-3 months as a rebel you can recruit quite a lot of additional troops over the starting 10k number, buy rockets and hire mercenaries.  None of the protest options seem to work and advisors over rule you every time... wish I could shoot the advisor... but I digress.About the only choice is to (as originally stated in my description above) attack the capital.  It doesn't matter that the country (enemy) has tanks, armored cars, etc.  Some countries SHOULD also have a solid air force and navy, but it doesn' matter, your forces win.  And then you are the leader of a country with lesser popularity than the other dude had and probably get ousted.HOW DO I RECONCILE THE FAILS OF THE GAME FOR A POSITIVE REVIEW:1) It's pretty much the only game out there with this scope, and as it follows the series (I think this is the 4th version), there are some improvements and new scenarios.  While it is pricey and may not appeal to everyone, there is a lot of depth to the game in laws, decision making, i.e. running a country.   IF you do run a country, any country even a small one, you do get to see how different political decisions affect other areas, and for that alone it is a pretty good game.2) The game just came out and likely some bugs are not entirely worked out, and probably needs a lot more feedback.3) You can mod the game and/or create new scenarios so for those wanting depth or changing things it does have those options.4) I didn't play too many game months in the game... so not sure if more choices become available later or if the overall game mechanics evolve or anything new pops up.  As one who likes to rush things (maybe I have ADD), I just wanted to see the rebels in action and take over a country.  In that aspect, above all, the game's promises are delivered.  You do get to be a rebel leader if you want and you do get to take over a country.5) This is not Minecraft, or some other simple game.  Or even a SIMS game.   But it does have depth.  Perhaps it needs more tweaking.  Perhaps it needs more fixes.   Or it can as simple as playing out a longer game, maybe be a rebel leader for 1-2 years and get more popularity.All in all, while recognizing that the game has some issues, I still give it a thumbs up... IF I could give it thumbs UP and DOWN, I would... it sort of in the middle, but in my case I still felt worth the buy and the playing.  Pricey... YES.   But again, nothing out there remotely close to it."
,Recommended,467520,25436566,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,Mia,"Not sure why people rip so hard on this. Yes it's buggy. Yes, it's expensive too. But seriously, c'mon! Strategy games these days are unique and sophisticated and have all sorts of things to do in them, but they have an intense feeling of being dragged forward in time, led ahead by the nose. Even Supreme Ruler devolves into tank combat pretty fast.And don't get me started on the whole ""every good game that goes into political nitty-gritty is an Election Game"" problem the strategy community has right now, in my opinion at least. There are sooo many great election simulators, but very few about actually BEING the head of state after that part, because it's complicated to put in that many life systems after all.If you play abandonware (or were around when those titles first came out!), some games I like you may recognize are Balance of Power, Shadow President, Alter Ego, and Creatures. They're all buggy or limited in their own ways, but the important thing is that they don't try to game-ify away the feeling of a cold straight-played life simulator, which is nice sometimes.Yes, it's hard to win in this game. Yes, it's a grindfest on par with phone games at certain moments in the gameplay. Yes, you'll get frustrated after doing everything right for half an hour that you can't seem to meet the criteria for ending/winning the current game. And bugs, who cares. This game has a TV NEWS SIMULATOR in it, for freakin sakes! You can flirt with diplomatic contacts, one-on-one, and watch the relationship develop over time with text and gifts from the person you're following around! WHO CARES IF YOU CAN'T WIN!*coughs a little* Ahem, sorry. Got a little carried away there. I'm not an idiot of course, and it's easy to see why less than 1% of the people who buy this game might actually enjoy it. But if you enjoyed the likes of Space Station 13, Starship Corporation, FortressCraft, or even Escapists and you're looking for a light-on-strategy political simulator that's heavy on toys and doodads to click on and play with, you might like this one as long as you're not as focused on progression and winning as you are on exploring features and options.For example, not many games of this type let you use nukes immediately, and most of them don't require you to wine and dine your military officials until they're on your side and willing to give you the launch authorization codes. I'm not saying these features stay dazzling forever, you have to try harder than usual to ""make your own fun"" and come up with plots and things and ideas to do, but that's my playstyle anyway. And no, it's not worth the money at all, really. It's something to get if you've got the disposable income handy, don't really ""get"" buyer's remorse, and want to play with a big heap of clickable buttons that let you do fun things in a modern world simulation as long as you're not pushing it too far.Power & Revolution is a toy, not a game. Think of it more as buying a license to a software engine, but instead of it being productivity tools it's an ""Earth Politics Game AI Engine"" that you can interact with, built by a small team who can't fix all the bugs. And now with the God'n Spy addition, you can manually edit the game variables, making it even more that way. So, I call this a toy: An object that has moving parts, instead of a game where it's designed to help you get sucked or drawn into the experience. But if you think you might like to try the former, it's pretty dang sophisticated, at least to me. In fact I'm surprised it has as few bugs as it does, considering that the engine seems to be updating the world piece-by-piece ""for real"" instead of ignoring large swaths of variables until the user gets interested in a country and then ""guessing"" what probably happened inside of that country. (Which is what I've seen some strategy simulators try to do in order to increase framerates.)Oh and if it runs slow? Well duh, it's supposed to. People don't seem to be used to games that have to do a lot of artificial brain calculations to work properly, but what that means is that your graphics card won't help you. Scream ""unoptimized!"" all you want, but I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt that writing all of the calculations for the gameworld was hard enough without having to make the code unreadable by optimizing it too. ""Real"" AI engines used in commercial applications can be slow at times, too, and making them multithreaded (or use GPU acceleration, which is always proprietary even when it's not) is a pain in the butt.If only this title could find an audience who enjoyed such things. How all the negative reviwers can't see the creativity and drive to create a unique piece of software is beyond me. P&R gets 3/5 from me just for being a special snowflake, and upgraded to 4 out of 5 stars for being such an interesting one at that. The one star removed is a combination of the bugs and the price, but I wouldn't dare take more than one star away from it because that would make it seem less amazing than it really is (to the right audience, if they ever exist and happen to notice that *this* exists).Basically if this review didn't bore or annoy you to tears, you'll probably like it.

,Not Recommended,467520,29213408,Posted: 12 January,all,SirLagsalott,"There's not much to say about this game that I haven't already said inmy Masters of the World review. This is the latest perennial installment of the game Commander in Chief that came out in 2009, but this time (gasp) the graphics are upgraded to 2003 quality instead of 2001! Truly groundbreaking work here, great job Eversim.Snark aside, Eversim is still charging you $50 for the same outdated, buggy, and broken mess you hopefully didn't buy into eight years ago. That's ten times the price of Sid Meier's Civilization III, which came out 14 years ago and is infinitely better than this mess. Eversim has made it clear that they care more about making as much money as possible by re-releasing the same game with one single new gameplay element every few years than they do about making something enjoyable and worthwhile for players. I love the concept of geo-political simulators, but this has been done before so many times by so many others, with actual passion and effort put into them - and normally dramatically less expensive than this - that there is no way in hell I'd recommend this to anyone looking to satisfy their craving for a good simulator of worldwide politics. If you like empire-building, go to the Civilization series. If you like military conquest, there are dozens of quality titles available to choose from. If you like a mix of both, there's Superpower 2 and many others available to you. By all means, find an alternative to this.I know I haven't played this game for an exorbitant amount of time. I honestly couldn't even finish the tutorial because it once again failed to realize when I complete a task. After starting a new game, the layer of ""polish"" - a term I'll have to use lightly around this company - melted away immediately and it was just Masters of the World with a new UI and a city-defense mechanic. Don't make the same mistake I made twice. You can buy a great game five times over with the money it costs to add this hulking monstrosity to your library."

If you love politics you'll love this game.To showcase why this game is like no other I'll highlight my first time playing GPS4:I started as one of five opposition parties in South Africa and as a centre-right party I often criticised the government for any new taxes.My anti-union party ironically became the main ally of all the labour unions of South Africa after much political flirting.After some fluctuating successful protests by my party the ruling party used their two thirds majority in parliament to push through legislation that extended the president’s term to 8 years. The president’s approval rating dropped to 8%.A sit in at the capital was organized by our party with nearly 500 000 people attending. After much persuasion a couple of labour unions and other political parties joined in.Our sit in became an uprising and the president was deposed by parliament.After a tense election campaign our party won 37% of the national vote and became the biggest and ruling party.A reform program to privatize many of South Africa’s industries and services led to huge economic growth and unemployment dropped to below 5%.Growth and spending sky rocketed and inflation reached 700%.The stock market crashed, rebels took over the capital and I am now in hiding.This all happened within two game time years.This game does not have the best graphics, sound or UI. But it is probably the most comprehensive political simulator out there with so many different options and decisions to choose from and make."

When you enter, there are numerous graphical errors, such as portrait parts dissapearing. Combat is really messed up, where you see bulgaria being defeated by FYROM, while half of the infantry gets annihilated before entering Skopje (capital city). And when your army gets annihilated and need to increase your recruitment from 2000 to 4000, you get kicked out by UN. And you get sit in and if you wont handle it, after 3 days, youll get deposed. Talk about a cluster♥♥♥♥...Not to mention that stats, be it religious or other, that are not tied to economy are awfully arranged. This is how you can see that after 99% muslim turkey, with population of ~80M gets annexed by ~90% Orthodox Georgia with ~5M population, entire 85M pops magically becomes 90% Orthodox. Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥... Superpower 2 had the regional distribution of religious and ethnic stats, that would alter countries composition after annexation. This game CAME IN 2004! And by the way, after Georgia annexes country 15 times larger, other countries dont really care (at least after end of the war), really realistic simulation of international relationships. Oh, yeah, speaking of Regions, Its so lovely to see Romania, or countries with similar cases being represented as 1 region countries, lovely insight. Its better than previous games, where UKRAINE WAS MADE TO BE 1 REGION COUNTRY (THATS SECOND LARGEST COUNTRY IN EUROPE AFTER RUSSIA)! AI is just atrocious. It doesnt replenish armies, restore equipement, build new bases instead of destroyed ones, develop infrastructure, go to war and act according to its interests AI is dead. But these are only flowers, lets talk about RealStuff: The EconomyBesides the fact that economy is hossibly messed up, despite the fact that it is quite detailed, Budget Deficit mecanics is absolutely cancerous. You could get the message on ""Budget Deficit is in Alert"" If you reduce it by several percental points due to constructions, trade agreements and so on. And this Budget deficit will result after several days, the game loss. First there is an advisor that tells you about this, then he advises you to leave after some days and then he talks about colapse of the market, even though you have 2% excess in the budget and afterwards after several days, Army executes you and all this, without you being able to do anything. Ok, first of all, why the ♥♥♥♥ do you need such chains of warnings, if you literally cant do anything about it? Warning is to WARN you, not giving you a death sentence. Another thing is that why the sudden overthrow? You could at least be able to start a civil war. And lastly WHY SHOULD THIS BE A REASON OF ABDICATION IN THE FIRST PLACE?! Robert Mugabe is a president of Zimbabwe, who literally ruined economy of Zimbabwe and reaching unseen hyperinflation, yet he remains in charge. Not to mention other absurd reasons of abdigation, like leader of country abdicating because 300 hippies are doing sit in in the capital. I mean WHO WOULD EVEN DO SUCH THING?And the saddest part is that this game as an idea is great concept and yet, it is ruined by incompetent developers and company.

,Not Recommended,467520,35424735,Posted: 2 October,all,Dr. Strangelove,"SummaryA game with a lot of potential, but a terrible failure in execution. If done correctly, this would have beaten any Paradox game in terms of depth and immersion, but what you get is a buggy and unstable ""simulation"" that will make you lose support and get anti-capitalist riots if you dare to lower the taxes, where attacking terrorists that hide in the town with several fighters would cause the people to revolt against you instantly, and where things like private education or healthcare are unthinkable. Overall, I would love this to work. I love the system of interaction with A LOT of different characters - politicians, governors, military men, secret agents, famous people like writers or athletes or even your wife and parents. This could have been insanely good, especially after years and years of constant development, but failed miserably. Don't buy it, unless maybe on -80% or -90% sale. It's not worth 10$ and will make you furious when you lose your save for tenth time in a row and have to start all over again.What works1. The great system of organizing meetings with different people, even though it gets repetitive after a while and there are not that many things to say.2. Military stuff is alright, not nearly as good as Paradox's games or even Supreme Ruler, but it's alright.3. Diplomacy is done alright and makes sense, but I would never call it ""realistic"". On realistic setting, in just a month, Afghanistan attacked Pakistan and Syria attacked Iraq. Almost every time.4. Map is alright, and I love how there are many different regions, like all the US states, although the regions are too random at times - I don't like how in Syria the regions don't cover the Kurdish areas so you could create a realistic Kurdish state.5. You get Wikipedia links to articles that describe issues that you have to decide on. That's a nice touch.6. The revolutions and riots inside your cities that you have to take care of are a nice touch.What doesn't work1. The price and the DLCs. The game is WAY overpriced and the DLCs are really pathetic - the in-game editor that breaks your game after a while, every single time, and a modding tool that is buggy as hell and mods are usually unstable too. All that for a price of an AAA title. Go figure.2. 3D models of characters - there are just a few of them, excluding the leaders and in some cases some important politicians - you get Jeb Bush for example, but not Rand Paul, for example.3. Too few political ideologies - there are no proper libertarians, greens, and terrorists' ideology is ""royalist"". Seriously?4. Economy is broken. Signing like 50 good or decent contracts with other countries and lowering the taxes a bit will easily get you a 60% GDP rise in a month, which is hard to stop and makes your inflation fly off the charts. What's more, most of my contracts were simply to sell my pharmaceutics across Europe as the US, along with maize, pork, beef, and some other stuff, while getting resources that I need - steel, bauxites, robots, coal, fuel - I negotiated reasonable prices for each good, which I guess simulates the international trade fairly well, but no - doing that will destroy the balance and make the game extremely gamey. Why even bother with the contract system then?5. For whatever reason there are no real names and mods that allow them are buggy.6. There is no private initiative in most areas - no private education, healthcare, research, insurance - you get stuck with public one and high taxes. Not really good if you want to try a more conservative or libertarian approach.7. Unrealistic reactions of your voters - almost every tax reductions end in popular unrest of anti-capitalists that somehow managed to get multi-million organizations in the US that can co-ordinate unrest accross America, you can cancel reimbursing people for doctor appointments and hospital visits almost entirely, but as long as you spend some more money on handicapped, emergency services and maternity care, it almost evens out. Bombing a town in the middle of Afghanistan with a few planes will result in an instant revolution. Is that ""realistic""?8. Bugs and terrible stability - your game will crash often, especially if you want to use the god'n spy DLC. You basically pay money to destroy your game. Classy.SummaryThey couldn't make it work many years ago, they can't make it work now. It's an overpriced trash.Even despite all that, I till hope that this can some day become the next Pride of Nations - a great game with a lot of depth and an amazing military system, but one that was once unbelievably buggy and unstable, and was so sluggish on a high-end PC that it was impossible to play. It's a great game now and easily beats Paradox's famous Victoria and Victoria 2 in pretty much every category. They've been patching it for years now, and you can really see their great dedication to a title that never sold that well and people who trusted them, and really earned my respect. Hope that this would some day finally happen to Geopolitical Simulator as well. It can be great, just needs a lot of polish."

It can even corrupt your savegame and you lose hours of your efforts to make your coutry great (which is REALLY hard).So, after playing 42 hours I cannot recommend this game until they really work hard on make a product stable that can be enjoyable.Just for you to know.

GPS4 is basically GPS3 with a recolored/rearranged GUI and a couple new features such as playing as a terrorist organization and city battles, both of which are IMHO unfulfilling. There are a couple extra DLC's which IMHO are worth it. And a couple new cheat codes (Alberteinsteinisalive! and Iamthearchitect!) for fast research and fast building.Playing as a terrorist is pretty difficult to say the least, and you can only create left leaning terrorist organizations. You can not ban the democrat party, you can not even delete the democrat party in the editor, but every other party you can. Overall it just wasn't very fun for me.CIty battles are, let's just say, tedious. It can be overwhelming enough just managing your normal military units, but to directly micromanage your military inside cities is just too much for me.As for the overall game, I play this game for it's depth and it's expansiveness. It is a political game, but it's also an economics game, and a war game, and it delves quite deep into each subject. Deeper than any game that specializes in even just one of those subjects. The depth of this game is not comparable to any other game out there, and I can't emphasize that enough. But, it is buggy as all hell and downright frustrating at times. It will crash. It will freeze. It will hang. The map will disappear and bug out. It will give incorrect stats and do weird things it shouldn't do. But it's worth it. I wish the game weren't that way, but it's a one of a kind game and you have to put up with it because you can't get this experience anywhere else.I have a rather high-end PC, 8-core overclocked watercooled CPU, 4gb 290x graphics, and the game runs good except when wars occur. Large, extensive wars will make the game unplayable no matter what computer you have. I don't know if it's a flaw in the game engine or simply the over-saturation of military units, but I manage to make it work (for the most part) by commanding my military and then leaving the military view to increase the framerate and it works for smaller wars but if other countries start joining in then time will come to a halt, and it will eventually freeze or crash, if not both. Which is disappointing. But I've still managed to annex over half the world... so it's still fun.Normally I would condemn a game with so many issues, and I do condemn this game for it but I have to leave a positive review simply because I still enjoy the game, It's frustrating as hell sometimes but I enjoy it for hours on end and there is no other game like it. Nothing even comes close."

,Recommended,467520,24885600,"Posted: 13 August, 2016",all,Alexander Alexandrov,"I made a very risky purchase yesterday with this game. I had heard good things from YouTubers like Kailvin and CommisarBro, but bad things from the rest of the community. I decided to buy this game and I thought that if I didn't like it I could just get a refund. I ended up playing it for 5 hours straight. Now I think the game overral is good but there are a few things that need to be fixed and patched.Pros :- Play as any country, terrorist organization or political party- In depth economic and political system- Choose how to run your country- Each country responds with realistic response to political reforms, so for example let's say you play as Iran, a country with Sharia law, enacting laws and reforms that are secular or laws that go against religion will make the poplution unhappy, while playing as a secular country like Germany or Britain, secular laws will make the population more happy- The city battles are pretty cool too, as you can actually command units around the city to hold key buildings or major chokepoints- Military action will have consequences around the world if you make the wrong decisions, like bombarding a city will rocket artillery- The parody names can be pretty clever sometimes, like Jack Ohama.- You can now play as revolutionaries, like play as pro democratic rebles in North Korea, and secular rebels in countries like Iran.Cons :- A pretty obvious one, the voice acting is awful- AI can be dumb or buggy, for example, I was playing as democratic Qatar rebels and I stormed the city palace. I had around 10 units in there and 3 enemy units walked in and killed 7 of mine because they didn't know how to react until I did manual commands- The game is poorly optimized. Now I'll admit I don't have the best PC in the world, but if I can run Battlefield 4 as decent framerate on average settings I should be able to run this game on ultra settings, but I can't- The tutorial isn't very good so the learning curve is very steep, I spent a few hours alone trying to learn how to navigate through menus, learning how to move military units on the campaign map and how to handle economics-  The revolutionaries mode needs some patching. It's a cool idea and it's fun to play, but it's very difficult to gain support from other countries, funding, and men to fight for your cause. I found myself trying to sway countries to help me most of the time rather than actually starting protests or fighting.Overral the game is good, and if you like simulations and don't mind the hefty price tag, this is a must buy, but for everyone else I'd wait until the developer patches the game to fix the dumb battle AI and fixes the optimazation. That is, if he fixes it."

However, if you want to experience these actions without a ♥♥♥♥-ton of bugs then it is not. Everism is that company that you want to love because they have an idea for a grand strategy game that you think is great but when it comes to delivering it they fall short. But then you tell them how they can fix it and they don't really listen very well. Let's be clear this game is fun but OH MY ♥♥♥♥ it is buggy. To this day I still haven't mastered how to not run a deficit eventually. I can tame it for a while but eventually it comes back. I understand this paragraph is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of information so let me be more organized below.DIPLOMACY: The diplomacy is alright in this game. Lots of different actions you can take towards other countries like Non-aggression, Support, and full blown alliance. You can also negotiate building bases in the countries you have an alliance with which is pretty cool. You can do many actions through the United Nations like request help with terminating terrorists, defending a country under attack etc. You can also create your own international organizations and invite countries to be in them. For example, I played as Brazil and created a South American producing organization of Automobiles where we controlled the price and eventually dominated the world market. [8/10]WAR: War, war never changes. But you can command units yourself or just let the AI command them for you. You can declare war on a country and occupy them until they love you again, (c'mon Iraq we did this because we love you) and you can completely annex them or colonize them, which if you've ever played Supreme Ruler it's basically the same as that. I will also mention espionage which is probably the best out of all other grand strategy games. Way too many options here but you can do so many things with agents: You can approach terrorists in other countries that you hate and fund them or you can dismantle them which will make the country like you. You can assassinate people in your own country and abroad. You can even conduct industrial espionage and sabatoge important economic aspects like nuclear plants. War: [7/10] Espionage: [10/10]GRAPHICS: [5/10] It's 2016 and if I can't see good ol' Mr. Vladimir Putin's passive aggressive angry face complete with the veins on his forehead in 4k resolution then you aren't doing graphics right. Nah, but for real if Bill O'reilly was doing a review of the graphics in the No Spin Zone it would get a big fat ""This game ♥♥♥♥♥IN SUCKS!"" from him. Not good but graphics aren't everything.USER INTERFACE: [5/10] Alright the interface makes me want to die. If I had to choose between navigating this clunky♥♥♥♥♥interface and watching Dom die in Gears of War 3 for the first time over and over again I would choose the latter, and that♥♥♥♥♥♥MADE ME CRY when I watched it. (RIP Player 2's everywhere). But in all seriousness the interface is slow, buggy, and gets pretty tiring after a while. It's not too game breaking but I can see if people hate it enough to not play it.BUGS: DID I ♥♥♥♥ING MENTION THE BUGS? SMH [4/10] It's probably the most stable geopolitical simulator out of the series and it's still buggy af.PRICE: [4/10] 1.) Take out student loans from the government. 2.)Profit... orrrr debt? Yeah this shouldn't be a 50 dollar game, wait for sale or become a pirate and take yer' booty mate! ARRRGH.OVERALL: [7/10] I know like the last four review titles really trashed it but I love grand strategy games and this one I still like despite all the errors that could be easily fixed. There is just something so satisfying about starting as Nicaragua and spamming the Whereismyslushfund! cheat until my GDP is 3 times the size of the rest of the world's GDP combined and I launch a program to obtain nuclear weapons illegally while simultaneously annexing all the countries in Central and South America.

It has 2 major bugs that I noticed and that are worse of mentioning.1.	Game time freezes at 23:59 (of some date). And none of game speed buttons work anymore. This basically means that you cannot play further. Game is frozen forever!You can load your latest save, but the bug will happen again at the same date.Fix: keep saving game all the time into different save files (at least 1 time in 3 months). When the bug happens restore the game from 1 year before freeze date. Only then you will be able to skip freeze date.2.	Good bug. You can increase your popularity to 93% at any time for free. And you can do it any number of times.What you need to do – go to Culture->Create festival. Set funds of a festival to 5 billions. You will get +3% popularity. Edit festival, add another 5 billion. You will get +3% popularity again. Repeat until you get somewhere 120% popularity (100% is max on a screen but actually max popularity is somewhere 115-120%). Once you done. Set funds of the festival to 100 millions. That will drop your popularity to 93%. Unpause the game. Wait couple of days. Delete festival. 93% popularity are yours in a cost of 5 minutes of painfully boring manipulations.1 more issue of the game. Popularity calculations are insane! You can lose your popularity very fast. Restore popularity is pain. 0% popularity- Game over!!!I highly recommend to play this game with God’n’Spy addon. This addon gives you God Mode.

Not wanting to simply stqart off ruling a country, I decided to start at my home since I know it well. I liv ein th eUSA so I decided to start with simply running for an election. Great. I pick a candidate and then....???? No idea. It seems I should rais emoney so I do so. Great! now I have some money. I can run a poll to see where I stand and I see I am well behind.After some investigation, I learn that I should take some positions on some policies. That makes sense. I am running for office. I pull up th emenu and there they are. Lots of policies and I can take positions on them. Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea what impact taking any particular policy position will have on the electorate. Even worse, since the elections are determined state by state, I have no way to determine what policies are important in what states.So... it becomes a ame of guessing ghe policies followed by spending money. I gave up right there assuming that if the most basic parts of a political simulation are that unusable, there is no point.Maybe someday in the next decade, someone will make a good geopolitical simulator. There is obviously a high demand, but it appears to be an impossible task. Steer clear. 0/10"

I have been playing this series since the very beginning and thus I feel I have a firm enough grip to recommend this game even with only 25 hours of playtime at the junction of writing this review.I felt the need to review this game because of how torn the reviews are over the game. Firstly and most importantly it is quite buggy and bugs have been a staple of the series but generally the game is quite stable and when a small studio is trying to model the entirety of the political situation across the globe in such detail I do have to excuse the generally small glitches that occur.The game is very difficult if you're new to the series as all of them have been, the general premise of the game is to stay in charge and alive but this time around not even the in charge part is quite correct! The main new draw of the game is certainly in the ability to play as a revolutionary or as the political opposition, although your options are perhaps a little limited in both of them the fact that the AI now goes through the same avenues as you do when they are opposing you is very satisfying and brings currently very pretinent issues such as the Libya/Isis crisis an awful lot of life.I'm trying not to write out too much in my review as I hate having to read lengthy reviews from what is generally just another member of the public but as an avid arm-chair politician I have found this series to be the only true option for ""What if"" scenarios and I would highly recommened it as such. I paid the full retail price of £40 and I do not regret it as someone who wants to support producing content like this but if you're more wary due to the other reviews I would absolutely recommend putting it on your wishlist and waiting for a sale."

Hearts of Iron Series...Supreme Ruler Series.... Super Power Series..... Etc.........Not One of those hits the nails this one does. Each of the other mentioned games has a formula that applies to every country and if you spend enough time with it you can make any country a super power.Power & Revolution takes a different formula for every country and I honestly Love that.

Having bought both GPS 2 & 3 and seeing the minimal change and improvements for the exorbitant price between them gave me little trust in this one. But eventually I decided to look and see anyways, and hell have they improved! Bugs and crashes: pretty much gone (in a matter of fact, this game even runs on my second computer of 32-bits, something it should not be able to) And finally you can be opposition!So, why would one but this or not?yes if you are crazy about politics (I for one am a student in political science, so you can take a guess if I fit here :P) The simulation is not perfect, but it is one if not the best political simulators out there. (democracy 3 is really good too though)no if you are here just to conquer the world, we have Europa Universalis 4 or Civ for that!However, you need to know how to play this game before you can have much fun.first of all, ditch the real-time simulation unless you are fighting wars, repressing rebellions or doing other things on the maps. you must take into account that politics are slow, and so are they in this game. So use the functions like skip until next event, process week etc.second, don't go mad! the simulation tends to become a mess when you do really stupid things, personally I consider this the -- Biggest -- weakness of this game! still, it IS unrealistic to think you can change your country to your will within a year... General advice: nly try to pass one law at a time! so wait with your next suggestion untill your current one is passed.Things that could be better:- More sturdy simulation, remaining dynamic through the years and not ending up doind weird things. They are improving massively on this point, but still after a while I see some random wars which make no sense (i.e. Morocco attacking Spain out of nowhere)- All these campaigns like ruler, legal opposition, revolution, independence etc. Should just be combined into one main campaign. Makes a lot more sense to just be able to choose any party including the ruling one when selecting a country than to change scenario if you decide you like the opposition party better.- Give a bit more love to minor nations. It is quite confusing to see the Netherlands have a significant share of a communist party, and having the center-left and socialist party (PvdA & SP) being mixed up in share of parliament.- make elections a little bit less like we have french-like runoff elections all over the world. Countries with a proportional parliamentary regime should not have two round elections, they should have a process of coalition-forming (so much you could do with this! could be so much fun!)So,  may have a  lot of critique, still I really recommend this game. Why? because I enjoyed every hour played into this game!"

I love the God n Spy mod.Excellent! :) Still more improvement is needed. cheats/mod makes the game more unstable which is sad- Update 2 - Still get quite addicted to this game, just this main bug that bothers me, when you use god n spy mod or console cheats, the values go a bit off, with the time and speed of the game, if you  fix this, I think I will be able to record this  and put it on youtube, it is a shame because it has a great concept, just poorly executed, but ill still recommend , surely the developers will deliever, it  is not unplayable, you can get a few hours out of this game but if you use cheats, game wont last very long , like a year max, and things go down hill from there, so you either have to save often, sometimes this corrects the problemI suggest the devs look into this if they bother to listen.  It looks nice , graphical wise, characters look goofy and weird but I kinda like that? and ocean is smooth and good to look at, land is an improvement, on high graphic setting, it does run smooth.So I told you the cons and advantages here, main con, to conclude this review, is the instability , drops when you use the god n spy dlc. or console cheats.  It does not crash very often but it does.advantages  is the concept of the game, laws and trying to control your citizens, you can alter the majority and perhaps make your nation completely  secular and atheistic, turn uk into different regimes /whatever country youre playing. - I think so anyway, otherwise why show stastics of demographics in religion?so yeah, get the game if you have extra cash, or wait till it goes on sale, is my recommendation, also I am not too sure if they will update - give us a bug fix or not, I feel that their current approach is to get money of us, give us software to mod, like the modding tool. maybe they're  leaving it up to us to patch it up, which I find quite offensive but I have played this game for hours and hours so I am clearly not too offended because im easily pleased.
