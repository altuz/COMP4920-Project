76561198194197047,Not Recommended,467570,33390442,Posted: 8 July,all,Shokal,"Voodoo :84. hours i think it is fair to give my honest opinion about the game.What is Voodoo about?When i first logged into game i had to turn off Motion Blur because it sucks. I don't like everything blurry when i run. I was upset i could not create my toon and pick what skin i could be or designs he had on his body like in the video it advertises it. So i started to run around and do stuff, I built my tools, built my hut, used other peoples tables to start crafting. I started to notice things were very unbalanced.As i got more into crafting i bought the game for a friend, I even had another friend buy the game to play with me. We than started trying out the weapons and the damage and all that good stuff. They all seem the same. The stats on the armor pretty much don't change. They are pretty much just cosmetic items with no purpose. Except maybe 2 sets one gives tiny bit more armor and the other gives like speed while wearing little protection, or at least that what it says.The items say stuff but we are all unsure if they really mean what they say.The shield gives no armor bonus, I also blocked with it and still took the same amount of damage.Hunting, There isn't alot of animals out in the world, that def needs to be increased. There needs to be more threat from AI. Than there needs to be an increase in the timer in which they respawn. But other than that it was okay.Bugs and Glitches,We'll there is a'lot but it is pre Alpha so this is expected. There are glicthes into rocks mountains whatever, There are bugs when stacking items into chest, There are some bugs that wont let you loot or craft or farm at times. Restarting your game or restarting sometimes wont fix it till the server restarts and even than it doesnt always fix it. I have a chest that wont even let me access it anymore. My buddy has a chest that wont let him take any items from it. So he decided to quit playing for now.Devs : this one is for you, bugs and glitches can be over looked at times by fans if there is excitment in the game. There is very little at this time. Why do i have 84 hours if i think it is so bad or boring? Simply because i had high hopes and wanted to experience the game. So even with the bugs and ugly skin i got i kept playing. However i am not sure how much longer i will continue to play in its current condition. Because it sucks. Only because there is nothing to look forward to or anything to be joyful about other than farming wood, Hunting or hoping another player comes online to kill him or have him help you down a boss.Things i feel will help fans come back or even keep me around :1. Day and night cycle ( maybe add torches for night time )2. Skin and character creation3. Armor have better stat changes along with the weapons4. Some type of leveling system like 1-10 or 1-20 some type of goal, Maybe to unlock the ability to craft an item5. More AI to kill and to harm us with a longer duration time after being killed by us to respawn6. Fishing for food with like a bonus stat for 10 mins or something or just for food would be nice.7. Cooking on the campfire Make it send a signal and cook same time.8. Character namesThats all i have, Thanks for taking the time to read my review."

,Recommended,467570,32490070,Posted: 16 June,all,[tT]cosmicmildew,"Great game, once you set up a house and  have your basic resources, the game gets even better. To have the most fun out of this game, I recommend playing with friends. Make alliances, keep your distance from baboons, and explore. Overall a fun game."
,Recommended,467570,33444091,Posted: 10 July,all,大肥胖老猫,"This game is worth buying, mostly because it has official servers and can be played like an MMO. This means that you won't have admin abuse on the main servers as you will have in some other multiplayer games such as Rust.The atmosphere and gameplay is much like Rust. Your body stays in the game when you logout, you place beds down to set your respawn point, and PVP is allowed everywhere. Bases can be built, but don't expect them to last. As a primarily builder-only player, I took a different turn and decided to participate in griefing with this game, so I have spent some time attacking bases while their occupants were offline. For those who enjoy reading comments from disgruntled raided players, this game is definitely not short of angry comments in Global Chat when people find out what happens with all their eggs in one basket - with breakable walls protecting their items. In terms of balance, it's faster to raid bases to collect some resources rather than trying to collect them the traditional way; and, in the process, you can takeover the base that someone spent days building.Keep in mind that this review reflects the game as at July 10, 2017, and the game could have been changed after this date, which would result in different observations. The following pros and cons are based only on the game as of the date at which this review was posted.Pros:-Good sized map to give you a chance without being caught by someone.-Fewer crashes than some other Alpha or Pre-Alpha games.-Resources can be tedious to collect, so raided bases often cause much drama in Global Chat when the occupants login to find their base partially destroyed, taken over, and/or looted completely.-Team building and team work. One end-game boss fight that provides access to higher level content.Cons:-Many bugs in the game, but the game is still fairly playable.-Low numbers on the servers. Could be fixed by limiting the game to one US server and one EU server, which would force people to fight rather than bail when they see the resources fenced off. (People complained that US-2 had some resources blocked off, so they came to US-1. The purpose of the game isn't to be idle on the beach, but to fight for the resources. People seem to want the easy route, which is to avoid griefers and PVP to play in a ""carebear"" fashion.)-Like most online games, people prefer to play solo, and it can be difficult to keep a stable group together. That can also be a benefit to those who raid small solo bases. However, for a game like this one, having a team of players is really important to building a large, defendable base.-No cursor for aiming. It's more realistic without the cursor, but people will just cheat and put up an overlay that handles the aiming for them.-Item duplication is an example of a well-abused bug in the game, but the developers aren't too concerned with it at the moment.-Old unused bases clutter up the map and take a long time to destroy with even the best weapon in the game, the Crown Club. This causes extra lag as the server has to send you information on every entity in the area you are in. (Big Hint: if your screen lags when you are walking along, that's an indication of a chest with plenty of items in it nearby.)-Items that are behind walls can be destroyed if they are within range of your attack. Items placed inside huts seem to be safe from this. This also means that people can loot boxes that are behind walls, and shoot arrows through walls. This could be intended, but I've still listed it as a con.-There's no opportunity to avoid killing teammates if you would like to have several people attacking a gate all at once. The most you can have is two people attacking the sides of the gate and even then, if one person moves too close they will get hit by their friend.-Stamina regeneration is a very crucial feature in the game, and it seems to be tied with internet connectivity. It's also client-side instead of server-side, meaning that someone could make a 3rd party program to provide themselves with unlimited stamina.-Many of the items in game are not fully implemented. For example, the special masks that require the pitch resource have no tangible function and shields don't have bonuses nor block any attacks.-Combining stacks of items often causes the entire inventory to disappear or act in a strange way. It's caused by bad pointer management in programming, where when you delete a memory address and then try to reference it later when that address could have been written to by something else in the program, you get some funky stuff happening. To fix the problem, you need to add to the second stack before deleting the first one. Don't try to copy the first stack after it's deleted from memory or you'll have these kinds of problems. Memory management in programming. You should always think in your head of what the program is doing as it goes through each line of code. Contrary to the ""experts"", all languages work procedurally like in the C language. All OOP does is it allows you to do is jump to different functions, but every function is still read one line after another just like in the C language. You need to read the code like a book. What's the next line of code going to accomplish? In this case, you referenced a memory address that may not exist. This is also why the bug is random and does not occur all the time. Sometimes that old address is null or not null, but it exists, and other times it's deleted, so it doesn't exist and that can cause some fairly major problems in the game, in terms of making items magically disappear and then re-appear later after a server restart. The problem is also server-side, not client-side."

,Recommended,467570,32616550,Posted: 21 June,all,MoonintheMist,"Well, this game is in Alpha. If you want to get it now, remember there isn't much content to it. Here are my thoughts about what the game is lacking or what needs doing:After having played this, I realise it is in Alpha but there are quite a few things that need doing imo.- Fix the FPS!- The most annoying thing is being in the jungle having all these trees and rocks yet not being able to harvest them because you can only harvest one type of tree and rock which are very few and far between... make the other trees/rocks harvestable or make the ones that are more obviously harvestablei.e make them glow/sparkle or something.- Add more animals and content. So far, not much to do except grind reources and build better things.- No map! This is definitely a priority. A map would make playing so much easier.- Character customisation! Why can't I customise my character? :(Content that could be added, from sooner to later imo:- More freedom of building i.e being able to build walls, foundations, to make buildings how you want.- Harvestable plants, and more varied plants.- With this would come food and water bars, to make it harder to stay alive. Food you can harvest from plants or cook meat from animals. Your hunger would go down as would your thirst.- More and different resources. Make the game more varied in terms of stuff you have to collect, to make it more interesting.- More and different creatures. So far I've only seen baboon and gazelle. Add more prey, and predators alike, which leads to:- A working ecosystem. Predators eat prey. (Maybe even in the far far future, breeding).- And thus predators that actually, you know, attack and damage you when you get near them.- Ridable animals. Not really a priority, but something that could be nice in the future.- Underwater swimming and some stuff underwater.Apart from that, it is a good game so far. I'll definitely keep an eye on it until it gets enough content to be more interesting to me. Keep up the good work, devs!"

,Not Recommended,467570,33791768,Posted: 25 July,all,Hallowyeen,"I am writing this review as of 7/25/2017, the current update I believe is ""Patch 0.14.17""Basically, you get a Tribal third person version of Rust/Hurtworld thats missing more content and features than should be allowed for even an early access game.This game seems to have great potential, it's definitely striving to go for a different theme and setting than Rust/Hurtworld/pretty much any of these online multiplayer survival games. Sadly, a LOT of rather important and crucial features are simply not in the game, as well as a myriad of other bugs and glitches.I feel that the crafting materials needed for a lot of the stuff to be too high, you need 100's and 100's of resources to build the basic crafting stations. Even then, the new things you can make with these crafting stations also require hundreds and hundreds of resources. The basic short bow (the cheapest ranged weapon) requires 100's of resources, and even then you need arrows that require something like 50 wood and stone, you'll be hard pressed to even get 50 wood or stone from a single tree/rock. The resource ""nodes"" seem to spawn very quickly, but this turns the game into camping at resource spawns as it is much faster and safer than actually staying on the move and exploring the area for resources.The games hit detection is absolute dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ Me and a friend hit eachother more than we hit a monkey we where trying to kill. Even with eachother standing perfectly still purposely trying to hit eachother, over half of our punches and swings go right through the other person. This goes for every single thing in the game, the entire 2 animals that make up this diverse primal africa, the large colossus you find, other players, and the trees/rocks you are trying to gather. None of it works, you can't hit/interact with them half of the time.There is a distinct lack of base features, you can not seem destroy/raid other players buildings (and as far as I know, they dont despawn). Your super expensive to craft arrows also can not even be picked up after firing them, the amount of arrows needed to kill an animal is also insane. It can take upwards of 5+ arrows just to kill a gazelle assuming the hit detection doesn't ♥♥♥♥ you over. The graphics settings are quite plentiful and the game runs quite well, but the volume sliders/voice chat functionality just do not work. The game mutes (or just makes it near unhearable) all sound if the master volume slider is below 50%, anywhere above 50% and the few sounds that are in the game will blow out your ear drums.Not to mention this game has 1 asian server, 1 U.S server, and something like 4 european servers. During the hour and a half or so I played with a friend, only 1 person ever joined us on the american server. The other servers only had 1 person on them or 0. I understand this is a pre-alpha game that just released 10 days ago as of writing this. But this game does not have very many players at all so do not go looking for player interaction and experience if you plan to buy it.Genuinly, it can work and i'd love to see it work, but it is nowhere near being able to provide a stable and enjoyable experience. Sadly with the trends of these early access unity survival games is that few of them actually ever get finished or reach a point where they can be considered a full game. I hope to come back to it in the future when it is full of more content. But sadly, as the game stands, I think of it as a waste of money. Try and get it on a sale at the very least if you MUST buy it."

This is a pre alpha so right now I am not going to go into technical detail. I will say that Im enjoying playing Voodoo so for right now it get's a thumbs up from me.

The art style is fantastic and I want to spend more time in that setting.I played for a bit over an hour and was disappointed.  If you aren't a part of a large group, there is no reason to play this game.  The direct focus on pvp and the giant boss fights mean small groups are at a horrible disadvantage and solo play looks absolutely terrible.  I am primarily a solo player and there is no place for that play style in the current build.  It feels like a really bad version of every other survival / crafting / pvp game out there.  I had to get a refund but am eager to buy once there is more of a game there and solo play is a possibility.I hope the game mechanics in Voodoo grow up to meet the wonderful art design and themes."

Yet within the first 34 minutes of gameplay I'm completely turned off by the combat alone.Step it up."

So we went to take the kill because we assumed it would be easy. The man in question then pulls out the club that does the most damage and started swinging wildly in front of him. Me and my mate were hitting him in the back and side over and over, he never took any damage and killed me while i was standing behind him. The mans friend then starts to talk♥♥♥♥♥♥and back him up over not taking damage; it turned into a conversation of the person not taking damage and his ""twin"", and how they kept talking bull and nonstop insults.10/10 People who fight unfairly then talk♥♥♥♥♥"

I can't gather so I can't craft anything and I don't need another walking simulator. I'll wait for awhile for a patch, it's now been almost a day since the bug confirmed and no patching. Or maybe I'll just refund and move on. Not having any great expectations about this game so I don't care to wait for long."

Crafting requires too many recources. The typical gameplay of ""find stick and rock - make axe"" is too much of this game's bulk when it should really be focussing on the meet. The simple yet deeply enthalling combat, the satifaction of amassing a tribe and taking on others. Finally of course there is this game's glint. The giant ""Izami."" This lumbering colossus is what draw me to this game, and what kept me in. I wanted to try and beat the game's typical monotamy to try my hand at the Shadow of the Colossus style boss fight. Unfortunately it took the entirety of my two hours to even get close to that point. The moment me, and another player tried we got stomped. Which is fine but those two hours of work were practically undone. I wasn't willing to do it all again.I think this game has some real potential with this merge of gameplay. I just think it needs to balance that gameplay more and get much more content (which isn't surprising for early access...)"

It might be acceptable for big title polished games but the alpha games are ripping the consumer off. Trust me you will get stuck with a title you will never use and guess what you can't sell it. ouch!

I thought I did too until I purchased this 10 dollar game developed by the very monkeys I dreamed of being. Not many people play but basically no one plays now that in an attempt to fix fps issues they made it worse. Now I run through the savanna littered with sleeping monkey men of the past wondering WTF is happening as I look at the stunning glory of 3 fps.I rate it 2 creationists/ 7 spherical heads

,Recommended,467570,33933238,Posted: 31 July,all,Profitz,"I like this game and I think it has some great potential if the developers keep focusing on it.  Currently the game allows you to build your own property/tribe and wall it in to avoid raiders.  There are several types of placeable objects (benches) which allow you to craft building components and various levels of weapons/armors.  There is also a concept of placing and object (looks like a pillar/totem) to disallow others to build next to you (similar to cabinets in Rust, thrones in Citidel, etc.).The resource gathering is pretty decent and I like how they appear.  The game is cartoony so if you are not one for that style of graphics, look on.  If you do like it, you will like the resource gathering as it shakes (or wiggles) when you hit it.  The resource gathering is not as grindy as other games since you get raw materials upon every swing.The building and placement system is good and allows for rotation of objects to fit your fancy.The combat system is ok, needs a little work.  The bow is decent and shows projectile pathing/trajectory.  I killed a few wild animals and you are able to hit-them to skin them and gather meats, etc.  Although there is no concept of cooking at the moment and a campfire is only used in the game to signal your local for your tridemates.I've gathered so far copper ore, tin ore, wood, bark (used for thread), leaves, obsidian, leather/hide, meat, shark teeth (from animals), etc.  There is currently no concept/mechanic for eating or drinking at this time and the only stats are tied up in a health and stamina bar.  There is also no encumberance or weight system in place yet either.With all that said, it's pretty damn good and I'm enjoying myself even if only 2 hrs in game yet.  I work through mechanics and beta test software fast (see above).  I'm looking forward for the next update!Stay tuned!"

I feel most are looking for another normal survival game, and I tend to have a different opinion.I don't want another Ark or Rust.Here are a few of my ideas:I hope the direction you take is far different..Yes, Character creation I truly believe in.I also plea for a more intelligent AI. Find a way to have more creatures, but also creatures who can hunt us down. Not just have the old school agro range.Please developers think outside the box. Surprise us.Show us challenge.I dont believe in the gear having stats, but it should affect us through different biomes.Hot deserts should make heavier armor impact our health, and so forth.For stats consider this.. Working out somehow.. Holding heavy objects, body training, ect. Adds strength, but also by increasing strength it should also slow down speed.. At a curve..Please make a more diverse crafting system.Make it so we have to eat and drink to truly survive.Add weather systems that impact the environment around us.Make a true survival game.. Where we actually have to survive during this ancient time...Make us fight not just eachother but the world. Environment, disease, and animal kind.Give us a true challenge other than the amazing puzzle giants!Thank you devs. Don't give in to the old.  Breach the new.
