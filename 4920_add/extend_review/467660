I've progressed as far as I could -- collecting all items in the book except for candle/dynamite. I am sure I missed out on a lot of dialogue and clues. :-(  Please subtitle your games for benefit of all, including those learning English as their second language as well."
,Recommended,467660,30505128,Posted: 14 March,all,christianled59,"Horrifying 9/10Allow me to preface this review by saying I haven't finished the game yet. Honestly, that should be a testimony of the game in itsself. It's too damn scary.Pros:-The graphics are stunning.-The sounds are even better than the graphics.-The puzzles are really fun so far. Quite a challenge.-Level design is amazing. The way the game lores you to specific places (even though you can freely roam the house).-Story is actually pretty intriguing. Not something Paranormal Activity is exactly known for.-The game is really atmospheric. The jumpscares aren't what really get to me, it's the build up and the immersion of vr. As a grown man, this game actually got me shivering.Cons:-The biggest con by far is the locomotion. I'm very very happy they didn't add teleportation (that would actually ruin this game), but instead the game relies on you pressing forward on the touch pad and looking in the direction you want to go. This can be annoying when I'm wanting to peek at something and keep walking forward at the same time. (I don't trust that f*cking painting)-The hands feel a bit off. Honestly, as a AAA game, the hands are actually really crap. The animations are bad and the models are cheap. They don't line up at all with my real life hands.-A little buggy, but it's Early Access so I can't complain much there.-The price is a bit steep. The game is 5-10 hours long but I think the game could have easily sold for $29.99 MSRP rather than $39.99. At least during early access.-Finding the first key for me was unnecessarily difficult. It was just too dark.Conclusion:Overally, it's a really great, well polished game. Probably the BEST horror game I've played on the Vive so far. The atmosphere is just spot on. If you like horror, then GET THIS GAME. I'm taking a break until my roommate gets up so I can work up the courage to go back into this damned game."

If I was in a real haunted house, I would be peaking around the corner as I step into the room, but if I did that with the current controls, I just run into the wall. Instead, I'm forced to just look straight ahead and until I clear the door, or any obstacles that might be in the room.EDIT#2: They seem to be listening to everyone's criticisms and are taking the steps to fix things. Very happy with this."

I am playing it through together with my mom since we both like scary games. But to me this game is so freaking scary that sometimes I can't stand to play it. It really gives you the creeps. I have reached 7 hours of gameplay so far and I don't know if I have much left or not. You have really made a great game here. I would love more games like these. I have nothing negative to say about it! Keep it up!!I totally recommend this game if you would like your pants to shift color or if you want to have a good laugh at your friends/family when they try it out!"

76561197991269066,Recommended,467660,30906901,Posted: 2 April,all,Maglot,"First and foremost, this is the scariest game I've ever played. That of course comes with the caveat that it's VR, so the scares are happening to, and all around YOU rather than a character you're playing on a monitor. The scares are nothing you haven't seen before in regular horror games, but being put in that space is extremely anxiety and panic inducing.I got the game when it launched at a bit of a discount ($30), and I feel that even with the bugs and shortcomings, it was well worth the money. My total play time after beating it was nearly five hours, but much of that was unfortunately spent restarting the game due to a bug. Those have seemingly since been worked out. The locomotion, while strange at first, is actually good for ratcheting up tension, as you can only move forward in the direction you're looking. This means when you think there might be somthing around the corner, you have to walk out and THEN turn, leaving you exposed and ready to poop your pants.The graphics are very good, and the flashlight is excellent. It makes you feel like you're really trapped in this unknown house and just gives you chills and a sense of dread with every new room you are forced to traverse.My biggest complaint, which is being currently worked on, is the extremely long load time to start the game. We're talking at least 90 seconds. Doesn't sound like much, but standing around in VR with nothing to do for over a minute feels like ages. The other complaint I have is there is no way to get to the main menu after starting game, so you have to quit out entirely, and wait forever for it to load again. Get that fixed and we're golden. :D"
76561198229626576,Recommended,467660,31817459,Posted: 17 May,all,agalasso92,"Id like to start by saying this is the first time Ive ever reviewed a game on here but this game is honestly the best experience Ive had with Virtual Reality.  It is one of the greatest video gaming experiences I have ever endured.  By far the most immersive Virtual Reality Game available.I am a grown man and someone who never gets scared while playing video games and this game had me on the flooring screaming constantly.  It took me over 13 hours to beat because I was too scared to progress and moved so slowly.  There were times where I was too shaking too much to move and actually frozen in fear.  Everytime I stopped playing and took off the Vive Headset, I was sweating, shaking and panting from the adrenaline I had pumping from playing.  Everyone of my friends that have tried this game had the same experiences as me and they were all too afraid to continue.This game is the most immersive Virtual Reality game that I have ever played.  The graphics are pretty good and make you feel like you are actually there.  The interactions, while sometimes arent the smoothest since its early access and thats understandable, feel pretty real and make you feel more connected to the game.  The constant heartbeat you hear in the game eventually becomes your own as you get lost in the House.  If you have Surround Sound Headphones and you use them, its easy to forget you arent actually in the house and its just a game.I didnt have problems with bugs in this game at all and didnt notice any if they did happen.  Since this game is currently in Early Access, its understandable that there are bugs and they are expected,  but the Devs are on top of it and active in the discussions.  I had run into a problem and got stuck and the Devs got back to me right away and I was able to finish the game without any problems.  So if anyone ever runs into any trouble, the Devs will be help you out and rather quickly too.This game will have you in constant fear.  The adrenaline rush you get from playing will be intense because the game is so immersive.  The movement system is perfect IMHO and people that complain of sickness probably arent used to this style of movement.  After playing the game a few times you will get used to the movement style and the sickness goes away.  The controls are simple and the game is good with drawing your attention certain events or places so that you do not get stuck.This game deserves a 10/10 rating and I cant wait to try the finished version."

It takes a minute to get used to but once you spend a few minutes in the game you don't notice anything awkward about it.  So don't listen to the haters.* The story is way better than I thought it would be.  Best horror game story I've played to date.  It's not plagued with jumpscares (there are some) but it's genuinely creepy the entire time with some really cool surprises.* The graphics are really good, but takes a decent PC to play it glitch free.  For me, 7th Gen i7 and GTX 1060 worked great.We really enjoyed the game and if you want a glimpse of what it's like for a newcomer you can watch my wife play here:https://youtu.be/RHu_06ZGAYk"
76561198387702756,Recommended,467660,32793977,Posted: 25 June,all,Rootpane,"Just Finished the game, I have taken many breaks, Real life, and such so the game took me 3 days to finish. I didn't find any Bugs in my game play, none that I would notice anyway. There was a Glitch with Graphics when I went up to the Attic, walls were dropped, looked like I was outside, Just restarted and things were back to normal.Game play, I felt a  good bit of how the game immerses you with the environment, even with the walking, and moving mechanics  I still felt like I was there and really felt part of it all. The game has that, someone is following you, or watching you feel all through the house, the jump scares added to the excitement and being a horror buff, I only wanted to explore to get to the next scare.  I really liked the game.Ok now for the little Tad bit that could of made it somewhat better, in no way, is this a complaint, but a Review is such.I think, a little change of venue at times could of made a difference, like having to go outside to the garden shed, or  old work shop. Just something that would change the landscape somewhat.  I, at times felt I wanted to move on to another part of the story quickly, maybe to quickly at times, because I was going through the same rooms over and over, and I can see there being a point of boredom, if things weren't completed to get to the next exciting part.For early access I had a great time playing, and I look forward to how thing game will evolve."
,Recommended,467660,32702484,Posted: 23 June,all,Mecha-Joelioto,"This is a very polished, well presented and crafted VR horror experience! Even though it is still in Early Access, it has more content and is more well done than most other horror (or most VR games in general) out there at the moment. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a thrilling experience and enjoys solving puzzles and getting the crap scared out of them! I would say this is worth the money considering the amount of polish, the hours you can get, and the fact that it is very easy to throw a friend in and immediately get them into a good scary experience without much effort or waiting around. The developers appear to also be very active on the forums and respond to their player base, which is always a good thing throughout EA development.Here is a breakdown of my thoughts on the various aspects of the game...Story: Yes, there is actually a story here! As you progress through the game you will learn more and more about what is going on, what has happened, and what things are leading up to. There is enough here to want you to keep playing through the horror aspects to find out what happens next. The dev is planning on creating multiple endings, which is a plus.Gameplay: Most of the gameplay involves trying to collect items throughout the suprisingly large house (it looks smaller on the outside). There is a good deal of puzzle solving. The puzzle solving isn't very advanced, but this is understandable. Some of the puzzles are harder to figure out, to the point the dev might want to think about putting in a hint system of somesort to help guide players. On a first play through, there is enough content here to last a few hours.Graphics: The game runs on UE4 and looks great while running great! I experienced very few graphical bugs while playing. The fidelity of the graphics really helped with the creepy atmosphere of the game. While I wish I could have interacted with more objects around the home (eg. clutter/drawers/etc) , it is understandable why everything does not have physics attached to it.Sound: The sound is very well done and helps add a lot to the atmosphere, vital to the horror aspect. Sound attenuates throughout the house , so sound sources will gradually get louder as you get closer, or will fade as you get farther or pass a wall into another room."
,Recommended,467660,30537567,Posted: 16 March,all,Complete Trash,"I purchased the VIVE for this game over a year ago, and I waited and waited, I can honestly say this is the first game that I feel is completly worth the higher price tag, the puzzles are not the easiest which is nice, figuring out which doors are now open due to triggers really keeps me on edge and the jump scares for the most part are really well done, there have been more than a few times that a new door unlocks and I contimplate quitting and comming back to it later when im less of a baby about it, paranormal avtivity VR has a truley creepy and disturbing atmosphere and besides some minor issues which the devs have already said they will work on (movement ect) It feels like the first completly polished VR horror game with the best bang for your buck. Untill this purchase I wasnt sure if the HTC vive was gonna live up to the hype but now i know if DEVS put this much time and effort into a game it can be a masterpiece that is completly immersive and so fun you dont mind the headset weighing you down, PROPS to the devs!Things to improve for the devs to make this amazing game just a bit better>some sort of way to know when the game is auto saving or an option to save your progress manually>when you pick up key items that go into the book it can be confusing when they just dissapear from pulling the trigger, i felt like this was not explained very well but not the biggest issue>some sort of way to know which drawers can be opended and which ones cant, maybe a slight glow to them or somthing, but with an option in the menu to disable it if you feel like it takes away from the immersive expierence>flash light flickering a billion times and then the battery falling out before you can put in a new battery, this feels more annoying than scary>supersampling options maybe? the graphics are great but my pc is running this game so well i wonder if i could kick it up a notchMy pc specs,I7-6700GTX 107016gb ramgame runs flawlessly with my setup, no stuttering what so ever, which is impressive since a fel VR games with worse graphics had issues , it shows how well this game is optimised and more devs need to follow this ones leadforgive my spelling errors not gonna proof read"

Fantastic title :)"
,Recommended,467660,30563969,Posted: 16 March,all,TheComAdore,"Let's get the criticisms out of the way;The Bad:-First off; You can cheat in this game by simply walking through doorsthere really needs to be a collision system that pushes your character back if the camera goes too far beyond the bound box. There's nothing that breaks a spooky atmosphere quicker than finding you have shadowcat's phazing abilities.-The physics! Who knows how objects will behave? Sometimes you let go of an item and it drops gracefully with the weight and heft expected of the item. Sometimes it rockets out of your hand and disappears into the scenery.Also if I drop something on the ground it takes a good deal of finagling to pick it up again. Might just be my setup tho.-Controls. opening a door is so hit and miss; I often have to try doors several times to confirm they are actually locked and my controls just aren't acting wonky. When interacting with objects the hands should be more constrained.-Audio issues. While the sound design is top notch; I still had some issues with the audio.For instance: when holding the tape player to my right ear, it plays in my left headphone. Right ear, left headphone. And, NO, my headphones aren't on backwards. And, NO, my inputs are not swapped because it's optical. Luckily putting my headphones on backwards let me enjoy the otherwise flawless soundscape.-Graphics: They are really great. the parts that are done anyway. This is early access, so I imagine textures and geometry will change a bit in the final product. As in some things that have an unfinished checkerboard texture will not look that way.-I beat this story in about 3 hours. That's over $10 per hour. Granted it will take some much longer to play through this.But that's an awful lot of ooohs and aaawes at the scenery to stretch it much further. Bottom line is I'd like more experiences here. maybe a twisted version of the whole house ala Silent Hill.(this kind of happens to one hallway. Just do more)-Interaction is basically good. But the jump scare at the end missed me completely and just looked goofy.- It's too easy. For me anyway. I had an excess of batteries at the end of the game. And I only died once. Because I wanted to see what it was like.Don't get me wrong. I really loved this experience.So let me tell you the things I loved;The great:- The concept. It's amazing to finally have an experience like this on the Vive. Among the wave shooters, and simulators, this is a real honest to goodness horror game. And from a perspective we don't normally see. Which makes it even scarier.- The graphics. You can tell a lot of love went into the design here. And it's pretty close to looking AAA quality. When the game is out of early access I can see it being pretty mind blowing.-The story is pretty interesting. Lots of detail has been added throughout most environments to tell the deeper story of the people who owned the house. And the in interactions with the occupants in the house make for some pretty stressful feels.-If you play nice with the game and take safe/expected actions it's one of the most immersive experiences available in VR.- This game actually has a good deal of replay value. As it's tempting to jump back in there and find stuff you might have missed because you were looking the wrong way. Or running away from something.- It's a positive step forward for VR in general.In summary:It needs some work. But just get it. You'll dig it."
76561198013058218,Recommended,467660,30785321,Posted: 27 March,all,Silent Night,"Best VR horror there is. Locomotion has been fixed and the devs are supporting the game well. This game is so terrifying to some people I've let play it that they wouldn't even go in the house at the beginning of the game. If you don't like horror games then stay clear. If you are a horror fan and didn't like the Paranormal Activity movies, this game is still a must buy. While it does still have a good amount of jump scares, it does an incredible job at creating an effective atmosphere which is what makes this game great. Also, if you are looking for hand holding, this game isn't for you. You will find yourself on your own wandering this massive dark house where you have to look for clues and solve the occasional puzzle/riddle on your own with no help. Even with the lack of hand holding I did not find myself aimlessly wandering too often."
,Not Recommended,467660,30620797,Posted: 19 March,all,Fooly,"Pros:- The graphics were decent.- The game seems like it could be scaryCons:- Nausiating locomotion (you click up on the touchpad to walk forward in whatever direction your head is facing). I could not last longer than 5 minutes before getting ill, which is not a problem I have with most games.- Awful framerate drops whenever the chaparone lines appear- Hands seem to pivot on a weird point instead of following the actual angle of the controllersUltimately I refunded the game after trying to play it a few times, and will keep an eye on it.

You pay for quality. This is one of the best VR experiences available. These devs are very talented, very active in their community and even more importantly they listen to their community, we as consumers should support that kind of developer.Also dont supersample this game, it's very high quality and needs alot of power to run. look at the min specs, you need minimum a 980... and I can't supersample without dropping frames on a 1080, you really don't need too either, the game looks gorgeous at 1.0 SS"

WHO DOESN'T put a quit/ save menu in there game?  This is a scary game, people will want to NOPE out without losing their progress?  Who's idea was that?- Dev told me this will be in the final version.4. I don't like that you have to look in the direction you want to move,  I understand that in horror games, looking the right way is essential to timing the scares perfectly, so idk what to do about this.This game has ALOT of potential especially with the IP and if you added story to it and alittle direction it would be great.  This is early access so maybe you guys will turn around and fix it.Do not just be another cash cow vr title.  Please respect that VR is new and we need a higher standard for VR developers not a 40 dollor (ON SALE) game that took me 2 hours to beat.To sum this up, I will give it a yes but, idk it needs work, cost 40 dollars,and i beat it in 2.7 hours."

I have never been so scared playing a video game in my life except maybe the first time I played the original resident evil in the early 90's.   Yes. their could be a couple more motion options.  Yes the doors should not be such a chore to open. Yes you shouldn't be able to just walk into a room through the door with out a key.  But this is early access.  People have been whinning an moaning that this game be released and then they allow us early access and then whine whine whine.  Look at it as a way to help make this the best game it can be by supporting developers and peaking interest in VR so that more amazing games like this one will be developed!  Fantastic graphics!

Feels like first gen GearVR but with way more frame drops and motion sickness.Here's an idea: Work on the game until it's actually functional, take your time, don't release this pay to beta test (early access) crap. Especially for $35. Plenty of game at a fraction of the cost (or even free) in early access that are WAY more polished than this.We need a decent haunted house/horror game that isn't just shooting zombies over and over. I thought that this would be the first to capture that flag given the Paranormal Activity branding/name.I'd be way more angry if I couldn't refund, so there's that I guess...I want to like this guys, but am instead very dissapointed."

I hope they listen to us while its in early access and adopt multiple control options.  I figure thats why the reviews are mixed.

,Recommended,467660,30527449,Posted: 15 March,all,NineZeroD,"The goodJust wow this game is amazing. It is so immersive, you actually feel like you are in it. I personally have been waiting for this game since it was announced. I bought a new ssd for this game and windows 10. No other reason but this game and it was worth it. For an early accesses game visually it is pretty polished. The sound is amazing, the tutorial in the beginning is fairly detailed in that most vr games I have seen dont properly explain how to play them. Ontop of this from what I have seen the company actually looks at the forums and offers to help people having issues. Now a days that is pretty rare. Now to the second part.The somewhat badI wanna start by saying that know it is early accesses so to me its not really a bad thing that it has bugs.Now there are a few things however that need improvement but if you know that going in, there should be no reason to give this a negative review. I mean think about it, by pointing out the flaws you actually get to be part of the development processes and shape a really cool game. As well the company hasnt delayed the game and they realized the people really wanted it asap so rather then make you wait another 6 months they let you have it and this also helps them to collect the bugs and get the end result sooner. Even offering a slight discount since its early access So a few things I have found.This game can be a bit blurry however it can be the placement of the vive or you can increase super sampling(you can look up a tutorial for this easy), I am gonna play with that more when I get home but I imagine it will help. The games hand placement versus object linup can be a little frustrating but their are ways around this. For example when you leave the tutorial area you will find a flashlight on the ground, even if the vive is setup correctly just bringing your hands down to the floor wont cut it, but if you actually get on your knees(gigaty) you will be able to pick it up.With some of the glitches think of them more as a puzzle that even the programmers didn't realize were their and send feedback. Of course their will be ones you cant fix but thats were the developer comes in. Personally when I figure out a way around a bug its kinda cool and your helping to improve the game.I have also found if you have an nvidia card you can over ride the game settings and make it apear even more polished and it makes you care a bit less about the blur. I will say however their are times were frame rates will drop for no real reason, even if you are just standing their. I imagine that will get addressed. I could only afford a gtx 970 oc when I got my comp but I was lucky enough to get other equipment that can be crazy over clocked to make this less of a problem. I might even try to finance a gtx 1080 ti to see if it improves it.The walking through doors thing is a bit weird but I have noticed this also on other vr games(such as emily wants to play), also there is no way to prevent a player from looking through objects since this is based on physical movement, If it could stop you it might ruin the atmosphere cause if your bent over but your character is standing it could be a bit disorienting.All this said the game is worth the buy even at early accesses personally I wish they did a public beta even with more bugs it would be worth it. So remember if you are going into early accesses its called that for a reason and dont let it frustrate you, help them to improve it."

Polished graphics, superb immersion with touch, sound and movement. The positional audio on headphones is great. Sense of dread is perfect, and not a game based just on cheap jump scares, which plenty try and get away with. The controls are good, but not quite right. they work, but can be frustrating. They dont quite feel as intuitive as some games do. But as early access, im guessing there will be room to move there. I'd like to see some mapping options available in future updates. This game though, overall, is superb. And it really shows the future potential of VR, in all genres. Devs need to play this game and learn from it!There are some bug reports.The obvious door bug, but if people want to exploit that and spoil the game for themselves....? Well, let them, carry on.Some objects i pick up seem to dissappear when i hit trigger again. Most objects land back on the surface when you drop them, but some dissapeared completely. Also, in what i assume to be the Sons' bedroom, the objects you pick up and drop on the bed seem to float in mid air i.e the 2 photos and the baseball cheering finger glove! Didnt seem to happen anywhere else in the room, just on the bed ;)Will happily report any more i find as i play more. But until then, thanks for a great game and a well polished product.

Closing your eyes won’t help either as this game has utterly haunting ambient audio that will make you want to curl up into a ball.  It's filled with scary encounters and danger that only gives you the option to run for your life.  Pay close enough attention and you might find out why you are there.

It was scary and fun, and I screamed out loud a few times,  sometimes I even screamed when nothing was there because it would freeze and for some reason startle me... Sometimes just looking around would cause it to stutter really bad. I have recommended PC requirments.  I recomment this game only becuase if you don't get sick from the locomotion and maybe your PC is super high end like GTX 1080 with 32GB of RAM maybe you won't have the judder, so it would work great for you.

The locomotion is fine. It's comfortable and easy to use. I think opening doors could be smoother and I would like to see an option to return to the menu during play.

As an early access I can understand the bugs being present and hopefully they'll be corrected in the final release.+ Great atmopshere, while it felt pale in comparison to how I felt playing P.T., I still felt trapped in that house, peeking behind nearly every corner to be sure it was safe to move!+ Decent puzzle, be prepared to backtrack a lot, but know things won't be the exact same when you do!- Flashlight, either unresponsive to the batteries or it gets stuck in your hand and you can't do anything to get rid of it!- Locomotion, the ""sprinting"" is very picky! It prefers you facing certian directions at times to even move remotely faster than the feeling of walking through waist high water.- Grabbing objects, while it worked on a whole, some handles to doors and cabinets were very picky on how you reach and grab it.- MAJOR GAME BREAKER! If you lean your head through the doors, you can actually slip through and enter the locked rooms! This appearently breaks the game's order of events but should still be addressed if it hasn't been already!- Not worth 40 dollars! I felt 34 was too much already, this should be a twenty dollar game if anything in my opinion. And not because of anything I have listed or will list, but because it's mostly a one time playthrough game, regardless how long it turns out to be. Once you finish it, what else can happen? You know the puzzles, you know the jumpscares. Only reason to keep playing is if you're having others take a turn that didn't watch you play."

I find it more scary than watching any of the Paranormal Activity movies.  I've been taking my time playing it since I bought it the day it came out over a month ago.  The improvements VRWERX have made in the locomotion options are great in my opinion.  I like guiding my movement with a controller/hand versus having to steer/move where I'm facing.  The gameplay and story is intriguing.  When you first start the game after you enter the white door in the attic, the scene changes and you find yourself standing on someone elses property alongside a flashlight nearby.  Your character is then tasked with having to explore a seemingly abandoned and unsettling multi-story house in search of key items to complete a demonic ritual while paranormal occurances and jumpscares befall your character.  What I personally can't wait to see more of the randomized jumpscares in the near future.  Thank you and excellent work Devs."

Subtle issues like the hand rotating around the index finger and not the wrist, locomotion is spotty at times, slowing down, running into invisible barriers. Would prefer full locomotion options, but they already posted on that so I can wait for an update.These are all issues I noticed within 15 mins of playing, also having absolutely no story to start, having no interest in who i am or why im at this house.Batteries on flashlight were dead by the time I got to the house so had to look at streams on how to find the first key.feels more like a haunted house then an actual game.

The right thumbstick angled turning is painfully, painfully slow, and this combined with the only movement being forward or away from where I am looking makes me spend more time struggling with moving and aiming than absorbing the environment and ambience.This doesn't seem to me like a game that should have released from Early Access yet.Edit: Changing turning angle in options helped a bunch, although the momentary screen blackout isn't great.  Changing to thumbstick movement instead of hmd aim helped, but now pressing in on the thumbstick doesn't sprint.There's no way to modify options once I've entered the main game, and no way to quit that I can tell other than returning to Oculus home or just force-closing the app after taking off my hmd.This could be a great game I think, but might need some more work and polish."

It was such an incredible experience, I've been hoping to find a similar game. Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul is not as good, but still quite good. A few quick comparisions:Price: A Chair in a Room is quite a bit cheaper and is also a better game with a better storySense of Place: A Chair in a Room uses pure room scale with redirection of movement to make you feel like you're moving between rooms. Paranormal activity requires a locomotion system, which isn't as immersive. On the other hand, it's a beautiful house and you feel a lot less cramped.Story: Hands down, A Chair in a Room has the better story. However, it has no real NPCs (except through windows) whereas my interactions with the little girl in Paranormal Activity slowly endeared me to her.Graphics: The nod goes to Paranormal Activity, though both look good.Scares: Honestly, I expected Paranormal Activity to be the scarier game, since A Chair in a Room wasn't going all out on the scares and was more trying to tell a story in a creepy environment. But I found A Chair in a Room to be the scarier game.Ending: Paranormal Activity's ending didn't impress me. Hopefully it will be improved in future releases. I loved A Chair in a Room's ending.Puzzles: A Chair in a Room has the better puzzles and they are more fun and make better sense. In Paranormal Activity, I finally had to look up how to proceed because I got bored 'item hunting' for items I had somehow missed that I needed to continue the game. I was stuck wandering around a big empty house just looking for missing items. When I found out where it was, I was not at all clear how I was supposed to have known. i.e. bad design.Don't take my wrong here. I did like Paranormal Activity. My daughters and I played it together (they made me be in the VR and called out suggestions) and it was a lot of fun. I don't regret buying it, even at the higher cost. But do yourself a favor and buy A Chair in a Room: Greenwater first if you have to choose between the two."

It's scary as all hell. No joke. I spent half the time alternating between players every time there was a scary moment. We switched a WHOLE lot. It makes you tense, it's not all jumpscares, and I felt that what I've played so far heavily reflected the vibe of the first film, which I loved. It's good. As they improve it, it will get better. If you can't deal with bugs but want to play this, I recommend waiting awhile until official full release or until a few more bugs are fixed. If you don't mind bugs and want the experience, dive in!Bug report:There are definitely some bugs to fix here, though based on what I've seen so far it's obvious this dev team can handle it! There's clearly some performance optimization that needs to happen. I'm not running a 1080ti or anything, but this was getting VERY stuttery for me at times, and I have had almost no (finalized) VR games do that for me so far. That will help a lot with the overall experience.There were also the previously reported bugs that they announced fixes were en route for: flashlight battery bug. Flashlight glitching and vanishing or not turning on at all until restart. And one area where standing near the wall kept glitching and putting me in the ceiling. If the devs want to know exactly they can message me. Don't want to add spoilers here. lolOverall, very solid! And super fun experience. Nicely done, dev team :)"

Since the trackpad is shared with the locomotion and the inventory system I will sometimes accidentally switch out my flashlight and will have to try and switch it back. This kind of adds to the scaryness though because it will usually happen when I want it out most.I love the game uses locomotion; I can't imagine playing a game like this with teleportation. However since the trackpad is used for this you only move in the direction you're looking (unless its reverse). In a game like this I would like to be able to look behind me while moving in another direction.I'm at the point in the game where I can't find a candle that is needed for some special door puzzle. I've recently found out where it is but I have a feeling the game will end shortly after which makes me sad because I'm loving it so far and I really wish it was longer, much much longer.

It is completely nauseating and is one of the worst types of locomotion for motion sickness. There are many different ways to combat this that 100's of different games implement. The fact that the devs haven't introduced anything to help speaks volumes about how closed minded they are about player feedback.Second: There appears to be no way to save the game. Some reviewers and forums talk about the game auto saves at certain events. Played this game for about 30 min at one point. Noticed there was no known option to save. When I entered the game again I was back in the very beginning with no flashlight or any items. This could be intentional or a consequence of the third issueThird: Super buggy. Sometimes items will disappear inside other items or the floor will be calibrated below the actual floor so you can't pick up items on the ground. (IE the flashlight in the beginning on the ground) (if the devs are reading this, which I doubt, why not just give the players the flashlight in the beginning after the tutorial and make the battery life infinite. That would do away with like 50% of your negative reviews and not change the gameplay one bit)Seeing this game is so close to being released I don't think we are going to see much more changes.

Figure out the bugs (of which there are a lot), and get feedback on the game at the same time. Unfortunately, they didnt do that. We are being charged FORTY DOLLARS for a buggy game where you spend a ton of time backtracking through the house in frustration (probably in an effort to make sure you can't refund it). This is a fun game, dont get me wrong, but it's not even in the ballpark of worth $40 at the moment. It's not even a very long game if you subtract the time you waste backtracking around the house over and over. Slapping the ""early axcess"" moniker on a game does not mean you can charge full prices for an unfinished game. This was hugely dissapointing for me, because like most of us we've been waiting on this for a long time.Everything above is unedited, but after talking to the dev a bit in the comments here I just wanted to add a footnote. This game is really good when you look past the price. That can't be overstated. It's one of the best vr horror games I've played.

I had to walk through the door.The flashlight never worked.. went out after a few second and that was it.  Batteries did not help.  Was very slow paced and boring.  Walked around the house for a while.  Had a few minor frights.  Got so board I just quit playing it.  The VR mechanics were a bit wonky.  Said it supported sitting down mode but does not really as you cannot turn.  The house its self looks really nifty.  I like the flashes of people walking around.  But it was too dark as my flashlight did not work.  I regret spending the money on this.

I was playing the game with friends, the spectator view was way darker than the VR view. So dark in fact, that it was almost impossible to see anything. We got stuck very early on looking for the next part. After 30 minutes of searching I had to look it up and it turned out to be a stupid little thing. After finally being able to continue, we suddenly got teleported in to a scary room, out of no where. It seemed strange but we kept going. Only to find out we were now stuck in said room. Upon looking it up, we weren't supposed to be in this room and we had no clue how we even ended up there. We had to restart the game to continue. Only for next time to be teleported again, this time in some random location somewhere in the map, which was clearly not intended.All in all, the game is very buggy and a lot of suspense is lost in trying to find random objects. I refunded the game."

My iron gut got sick with this title which is something that's never happened before.  Hands feel off and there is no way to tell if the dozens of drawers and cabinets in the game is interactable so you have to try every single door.  There's also the annoying door physics where if you open a door and you try to walk through it with the terrible locomotion system most of the time you will end up closing the door instead of walking through it.To it's credit, it does look and sound quite nice, but the obtuse puzzles, poor tracking, and juttery movement takes away any positive parts to me."

Well. What can I say. This game is gorgeous. Let's start from the beginning. At the start of the game (before the menu shows up) they give you a set of instructions and a mini tutorial which is actually pretty helpfull. The controls in this game is not as awfull as people say and they are fine. The only thing that was a little bit annoying was that you couldnt move from side to side, but only back and forth. I have not met any problems with the graphics or framerates dropping even though I run on a GTX 970. This game is just fantastic. The graphics looks so realistic and the sounds are amazing. This game really did live up to its hype and expectations.Another thing I wanted to talk about is the problem I had with the game that made me want to leave a negative review since I almost couldn't play the game. I was one of the first people to get this game, since I was practically waiting for it to be available. I could unfortunatley not play it until a day later because of the loadup problem that I faced. After trying to get it to start several times, I gave up and went on Facebook. I went to the ''Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul'' page and sent them a message. I got an answer in under one hour and the guy/girl that I talked to was very helpful. I was really suprised of how helpful they were on their Facebook page. I explained the problem and they took it forward immidiatley even though they had heavy traffic because of the release. He gave me some tips and advice, but it was too late so I went to bed. I thanked them the next day and was suprised that they kept sending me messages asking me how it went and if I needed other solutions. They were actually persistant and kept trying to help me until I got the help that I needed, which I appreciated because you don't see that in a lot of devs. Trust me when I say that you really want to support these devs because of the effort they put into this. If you go and read the negative reviews, you will see that most of them have been answered by the devs themselves.(PS: My problem was a black screen at the beginning and the game was unresponsive. It just refused to load up. The solution was to wait a couple of minutes without doing anything, in order to let the game load)Overall, this game is great. Get it."

It has so many bugs and glitches that it is nearly impossible to progress. For example, I couldn't pick up the flashlight the first time I started it, so I assumed you couldn't. Restarted the game, still took a few minutes for the game to realize I was trying to pick it up. I even reset all my sensors for oculus in case that was the issue. THEN I couldn't put my flashlight away after putting batteries in it, and it stopped turning on/off. So I was stuck with it in my hand; restarted again. Also, the game glitched and I ended up in different rooms like 3 times without doing anything. SOOO mad that I paid $34 for something that needs A LOT more work! Also, the frame rate went down from 60 to 10, and it never knows where my hands are. Do NOT buy yet, wait for some major fixes to this game!The sound, on the other hand, is phenomenal; and so are the graphics. Has the potential to be an awesome game, but it is not there yet.UPDATE* Mar. 28thPlayed again after the recent update, and so far I haven't had a problem. I can finally pick up items off the ground, and the items in my hand have been working without glitching. I also haven't teleported through walls. The autosave feature still needs work, although it doesn't set me too far back. Also, different save files would be nice, since the only option when someone wants to try the game is to start from the beginning or have them play on my game file.

There are so many great things about it. But there are a couple of really annoying game breaking bugs that really need to get fixed:1.- The game doesn´t save correctly, i´ve been playing for 3 hours and when i get back to continue the game, the objects i already collected and some doors or passages that i already opened now are closed and of course you need all the objects the game lost when the game was ""saved"" to open or unlock the passages, total waste of time and annoying to go looking again for the objects.2.- The flashlight doesn´t work half the time, you can´t put the batteries on , you have to restart and in the restart you will lose something, opened doors and objects already collected.This 2 bugs are what annoys me the most and i can´t get pass this, of course there are other bugs and fixes, like the locomotion or the ability to go through walls and closed doors, but that just takes time to adjust and then its ok (the locomotion) and the other one just dont cheat and youll be okay.As i said i would love to recommend it, i really enjoyed playing and it's completely immersive and terrifying, until you get annoyed for those errors, but at this moment is just unplayable, if devs fix those 2 major bugs i will change the review asap."

Not finding the movement control a problem at all (and I do usually get nauseous with a lot of these sliding-type movement systems). Granted, I only played for half an hour before noping out for the night, and I kept my pace slow throughout. Will go into the house again tomorrow... during the daylight. Good scary fun!*UPDATE* Now a couple of hours into the game I firmly stand by my frist impressions: runs smooth, no game-breaking bugs for me. There are some wonderful, creepy set pieces later in the game. The long loading screen is ridiculous, but not that big a deal (and they are working on a fix). Batteries are fickle but always seem to load when my flashlight is fully out of power. Definitely a lot of walking around and some backtracking but with randomized haunts and other details that make it feel like walking around in a truly haunted house (as opposed to an over-the-top Resident Evil style experience).

Suggestion: see the game ""weeping doll"" on psvr, when pressing the button for inventory, many boxes appear on screen and we can choose the items we want to use and we can place any items in the inventory. We should be able to place any items in our inventory.One other suggestion: the batteries act as a trigger to going forward in the game. I can be very consfuse.

When we try to open a door that is locked, we should be notice with a text that say: locked or the guy can speak: hmm lockec! so we can know the difference between which doors can be opened and which ones are just decorative doors.Note: if you want more constructive suggestions, just ask me, I play that game a lot with all my guests and I have all their critics and reviews :)"
