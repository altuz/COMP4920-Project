A 4-player setup:  the players need to get from one side of the level to the other, while dodging the traps that themselves and their mates set up beforehand and pick up the treasure.It's a fast-paced experience and a full roller-coaster of emotions, going from evil snickering to tragic defeat in under 5 mins.Great game! Really worth trying out."

If you're looking for screaming murder-your-friends type of simple fun, then you've come to the right place. Easy to pick up, runs with no hiccups, and the price is spot on. With workshop support coming down the pipeline this title is shaping up to be a staple of our weekly game nights for sure. All that and the developer is extremely responsive to the community as well!"

It is a perfect game for streaming with friends or if you like game such as Town of Salem, Golf with Friends and Quiplash then this is also a great game for you. Would recommend to basically everyone."

76561198036064556,Recommended,467760,24945482,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,jayhawk,"SummaryI played this with multiple family members on local multiplayer and it was a lot of fun. This is a great game if you have multiple controller devices to use (e.g. a keboard and a gamepad). There's also a bit of game rules customization. You can exclude certain traps and pick which maps will be played on. It's a little difficult to view the maps you're choosing since they are tiny, but it's doable.There's a Level Editor now!You can make levels and upload/download them from the Steam Workshop! I think if people make challenging maps that you can do by yourself, this should solve the problem for singleplayer content in this game. I made a few challenge and puzzle levels myself and I think this game now has the potential for great content creation independent of the developer making it. Speaking of the level editor, it's really simple and easy to use.MultiplayerI absolutely recommend this gameif you want to have an open party experience.For online multiplayer, I haven't seen any open servers so I can't recommend it if you don't plan on playing with people you don't know online. However, if you want to try playing challenging premade levels from the workshop, I think there will be more good content like that in the future. I don't think the levels will get too complex, though, but we will see how that turns out.Local Multiplayer Building PhaseIf you want to know how the building phase in local multiplayer works, basically everyone builds at the same time, but since you are so focused on where you are placing your traps, it is hard to cheat and look at other people's traps unless you finish placing all your own.Do I recommend this game?It's a resounding yes! Play with friends IRL in local multiplayer, and download levels off the Steam workshop. Again, if you plan on playing with the online community, there isn't one, so don't plan on getting the game for that."

And do you know what the best part is??? Its the fact that the developer is still adding in more things such as traps and levels. They are also planning on adding a level editor with Steam workshop support! I would defintly reccomend this game.Although I won't give this game a 10/10 on the Early Access stage for lacking things rather Ill give this game a...9/10"
