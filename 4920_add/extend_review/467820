It really needs single player bots because of how small the community is.  I reccomend getting a subreddit or a couple of ads somewhere in order to see this game really fly.Ending quote""The new COD Infinite Warfare DLC looks great!""PLEASE MARK THIS AS HELPFUL!

,Recommended,467820,26418995,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,The Answer,"LOTS of fun even in it's current state. It still needs a lot of work but that's obvious because the game is still in Early Access. It's playable, just not a lot of content and players. I can only see 2 servers when finding a game. But it's still growing and soon it will get more players.Right now it only has 3 game modes: Free for All, TDM and Capture the Sphere. CtS is like Capture the flag gamemodes in other games, but this time it's a sphere and you have to pull it with your gun to the goal. I like it, but it has balancing issues. Can be fixed by maybe adding a respawn timer and make the sphere move faster.The game only has 6 maps and 5 guns right now, but they all vary.Can't go wrong with this game, it still has a lot of room for improvement and it will be updated frequently.If you want to try the game, see how gravity works in this game and whatnot, go for it! It takes time getting used to it, but it's really fun!"

,Recommended,467820,28879583,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Nebulous Neptunium,"I will preface this review by saying that I put the most importance on gameplay when judging a game and that items such as graphics and general interfaces are secondary critiques. If a game is good, I will enjoy it no matter how it may look.This game has a free demo on the internet, but it was so good that I decided to buy the full game. Simply put, this game has some of the most innovative and fun gameplay mechanics in a third-person shooter that I've seen in a long time. The controls are easy to pick up, and the movement capabilities of the in-game avatar seem limitless. The ability to toggle the gravity boots on and off allow for grounded gameplay or zero gravity mayhem. This, coupled with the beam that allows the player to grapple around the map, allows for immensely satisfying and exciting gameplay. I've only played for a short while in the full game, but it is so incredibly amazing how much fun I've gotten out of the gameplay.Now of course this title is still in Early Access, and as such there are a few issues. The problem that sticks out the most is the lack of a stable player base at the moment. If you have friends or are on during peak hours, finding a game is simple, but the lack of AI in the current build of the game means that you're out of luck playing solo unless you're content practicing your movement, which I must say is still a ton of fun to do even by yourself.The graphics are pretty decent, but the graphical interface needs some work. I fully expect the graphical interface to be ironed out, and the game definitely looks good for what it is. The particle effects are nice and the lighting is definitely good-looking. Just look at the screenshots and videos above for an idea of what to expect. Overall, the game has a distinct lack of visual polish, but that is to be expected of a game in the early stages of development.I have not experienced any major glitches or hang-ups at this point in time with this game, so that should not be a major issue. However, I have not experienced the full depth of this game at this point so that remains to be seen in its entirety.As a last note, I must say that I consider this game to be amazing. The developer has definitely hit on a great idea for the basic gameplay, and with a little bit of polish and further development to add more features, this game will be at the top of my favorite games list in no time."

76561198302119307,Recommended,467820,34373979,Posted: 20 August,all,BalloonHead,"This game is amazing!I'll admit, the price is a little high right now considering there are no active servers most of the time, but I'll get to that later.I love the concept, and with regular updates I find it pretty exciting to see what has been added and watching this game progress over time. It has always been insane fun though, and it seems like the perfect game minus some things like the title screen (which I hope will be improved in the future) that just make it seem a little less... professional I guess?But the main problem has come up in a lot of reviews so I'm sure you're already aware... almost no one plays it.When I say almost, what I mean is this; when I try to find a server, there are almost always none. However, there are ways around this. The obvious one is just to play it with a friend; that way there is an active server and people are very likely to join. Sometimes I just make a server and sit in it, maybe go on my phone or whatever, and, at certain times of the day, at least someone will join. This seems like an annoying thing to do, I know, but I still love the game nonetheless.I hope this was helpful, I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have any friends who have the game, but if you do this is one of the most fun games for the price!(although PS I think the price should be lower or free just until it has enough regular players :).)"

My biggest pet peeve with most space games is that there is always ""artificial gravity"" in the ships, so all the walking and such is just like any other shooter out there. This game is a major breath of fresh air in comparison. There is true zero gravity, you can attach yourself to surfaces in any direction. The only thing the game really needs is a bit of polishing.Pros:-Lack of gravity-Great physics-Mind-bending arenas-Unique gameplay-Low price, well worth the $3Cons:-textures are simplistic-Sound effects need polishing-UI could be refined-No background music-Few servers (if there are none open, just host your own and people will join, I hosted for a matter of seconds and almost immediately had people joining)All in all, the game shows great potential. I really cannot wait to see how this one will turn out. I am definitely going to be spending more time in this game.8/10 for gameplay, will increase as the game improves."

This game has some serious potiental to become really popular. Also for a great price. But the game can glitchy and lags occasionally. But again, I understand it's a new game still in development. But in the final draft I hope these are issues that can be resolved."
,Recommended,467820,28475508,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,Selscon,"I'm just going to give my honest review on the game. No witty, sarcastic comments.(there's a tl;dr version at the bottom of the review.)First off.I love this game.Albeit I suck at it, I love it.Here's my pros and cons list.Pros:*Very fun, fast-paced, competitive gameplay.*Tutorial tells you everything you need to know. Everything.*It runs on the Unreal Engine (the same game engine Goat Simulator uses). Happy derpyass ragdolling time!*Great with friends over LAN.*7 maps to choose from.*4 different gamemodes.*5 different weapons that spawn in each map.*The guy who made this is one of the most friendly devs I've ever seen. He responds to alot (if not all) of his comments and suggestions.*This game updates SOOOOOOO frequently. Seriously. Just wow. I absolutely hope that this dev doesn't stop updating.*This game truly has some potential in the long run.*The dev is currently working on a Steam Workshop feature, which would allow people to make and upload new maps. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.Cons:*The biggest con is that it's hard to find open servers sometimes. This makes sense, as it's a relatively unknown early-access game. This can (and definitely will) be a real buzzkill though.*All of the weapons spawn in the same place in each map. For instance, on the Pipe map, the rocket launcher always spawns in one room. This might sound nice to some people, but when you have some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥puppyguarding the sniper rifle, it's really annoying. This also gives more experienced players an advantage, as they probably know from the get-go where all of the weapons are in one map. You get swarmed by a guy with a rocket launcher before you even know how half of the map is laid out. I don't think they can fix this, but if you COULD randomize weapons spawn points, it would make the game just a tiny bit better.*No singleplayer bots yet. (it's only multiplayer)Did I mention the game is only 3 bucks?That is one of the best deals I've ever seen. (other than like when gmod is on sale and it's only like $2)tl;dr version:Terrific game at a reasonable price. The game itself has so much potential. A couple problems here and there, but amazing in the grand scheme of things. I absolutely can't wait to see how it progresses. The final version will be amazing.Rating:9.88888888/10"
,Recommended,467820,28167945,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,BlackHole,"Great game! I could find no other game like it on the market! Obviously, it's still in early access so some stuff to work on. For instance, there is no AI, there are only sound effects (no music) which gets kind of repetitive, and the GUIs are kind of glitchy. However, I'm very excited for this to fully come out! It's an amazing concept and it's coming along great!8.5/10"

Here are some pros and cons I've seen in the little time I've played:Pros-Super great concept (reminiscent of the battle room from Ender's game)-Incredibly cheap-Controls are pretty intuitive-Some nice variety in the guns-Hillarious ragdoll physicsCons-Very few people on the servers (I have a friend who plays, so not a huge deal, but I'd like to see some growth)-Pretty ugly user interface-Not a ton of features (no local multiplayer, no LAN option, no AI in single player, etc.)Keep in mind that a lot of the cons will be fixed as the game continues to go through development, and the creator has said he intends to fix a lot of the things I've mentioned. All in all, for three dollars (you spend more than that on fast food) this game is a steal. What are you waiting for?"

Maybe a 6or 7 out of 10 for me because I like the concept and mechanics, but the game is not my favourite genre/style, I like some other games better."

There are some minor visual issues and things regarding curving around 3 dimensional magnetic floors and how it affects your view (like traveling from 1 face of a cube to another will curve everything making combat while walking around it clunky, it will change your crosshair placement). Some magnetic surfaces have issues activating correctly too , usually when there are many in close proximity. Besides that the skeleton for a very fun arena shooter is here but like i said, noone plays this for whatever reason. At this point I would even reccomend making it free for a period of time or giving out copies to popular youtubers etc to see if there will be a spike in the playerbase. Also some added customizable items that you gain from playing/ challenges for your character (cosmetics) would probably help in holding more players for the long run giving them something to aim for. Im torn as to whether I should reccomend this game simply because if you were to buy this game there will be hardly anyone to play with, but on the other hand if noone buys the game then the issue will persist."
