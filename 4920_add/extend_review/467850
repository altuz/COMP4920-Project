,Not Recommended,467850,23720519,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,Dojutrek,"The Good:The Graphics are nice for a 16-bit Mega Man CloneThe Neutral:(See Below for reasons)Character Handling is pretty spot on.Music is unmemorable and repetitive. 'nuf said.The Controls are rigid, but decent.The Bad:(See Below for reasons)Level Design is beyond abysmalEnemy Placement is shoddy at bestDetailed Review:(Sigh)...Where to begin...I mainly played on the 360 controller, which wasn't too bad if a bit rigid. So overall the controls weren't too bad, as most of the movement was relegated to the D-pad which considering it is how a game like this is supposed to be played. There was a few issues with getting the controller to work, but that was due to a HID (Human Interface Devices) issue and is entirely on my PC setup.Along with the decent controls, the handling of the player avatar is pretty spot on with what you'd expect from a game in this genre. The jumping and movement are decent approximations of the older platformers in this genre of games, even the inclusion of a dash is quite nice to extend jumps and push through obstacles. It definitely channels the old Mega Man games well, but that's where that comparison ends.Now on to the really bad parts of the game and the stuff that made me start this review in the first place. The Level Design is possibly the worst offender in deaths and cheap moments in this game, but that's not to say that the theming and the atmosphere of the levels are bad, on the contrary they each have their distinct feel which is actually good.  However, when it comes to the construction of the levels and overall enemy placement it is clearly so far flung from what a good game is that it creates it's own level of hell for all involved to stew in.Let's back up a bit, the concpet of a decent level should have some Hazard Foresight/Telegraphing, where the player is put into a situation where they encounter dangers in a relatively solitary environment, then later on be thrust into a much more dangerous environment with multiple dangers coming at once. MetaGal does none of this, it basically throws caution and decent level design to the wind which results in a multitude of situations where the player is thrown into a situation where death is the only recourse for no misstep of their own.This poor hazard telegraphing goes hand-in-hand with the amount of instant death pits and spike traps, the latter of which reminds me of a LEGO crazed six year-olds bedroom. It's nearly impossible to get around or through the levels when death is looming below numerous fall away and moving platforms. The worst part is all the levels are like this and make traversing them to the Boss room harder than the bosses themselves.Along with these death traps, the enemies are a constant source of frustration and death which along with all the previously mentioned issues only ramp the problems up further. The basic enemies in MetaGal sponge up way too many shots and are so numerous that sometimes the screen scroll IS your worst enemy (Ex. Warp's Stage). Not to mention the placement of such enemies are often in front of instant death zones or in areas where a single hit can knock you into said death zone.Overall, I don't recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the genre or even looking for an alternative from other games (i.e. Mighty No. 9). This game falls so flat on what makes a platformer good and memorable that I regret adding this game to my library."

Most of my problems come from the game being D-Pad exclusive, making it a pain to play on an Xbox 360 controller. The backgrounds are actually decently detailed, and the character sprites are pretty great. The game runs really well at a solid 60 fps, which is impressive for what seems to be this developer's first project.I do think the text needs better translation though, and a dash button should be added as well, or change the button combonation to make it go. But seeing how the developer is actually taking into consideration feedback to improve the game down the line, rather than leaving it in its average state shows the dedication from them to make an actually solid game."

,Not Recommended,467850,24050881,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Mofuji,"Let's cut right to the chase; everything is decent up until fortress 3. The level design is a little uneven, the dialogue is clearly written by somebody whose first or even second language is not English, but the challenge of the game is on par with most normal Mega Man games as are the controls. Originally you'll think that the game is a fun, if short little romp into something we've all been begging for; more Mega Man (but with mostly female characters for flavor). However, once you hit fortress 3, everything goes out the window and it becomes apparent that the person or people who made this stage hates your guts.The first section isn't that horrible, it's a bunch of moving platforms and if you stick to the top then everything will be fine... but if you do fall then you're in for a world of instant death pits, spikes and tricky jumps. The next section is delicious cake and perhaps the only small mercy you will ever see in this place, it's just simple timed dashing. Then the next part is where the stage first lost me; blind jumps onto spikes, having to abuse the fire dash special ability to pass over multiple spike floors, water that will send you head first into more spikes with enemies whose respawn is beyond anything Mega Man had seen, and then another section of more blind jumps with spikes with a gravity gimmick over instant death pits. Oh, and none of this has a checkpoint, so you need to do this all in one life.When you do finally get a checkpoint it's just cruel sugar coating to the horror that the stage is half done; now comes instant death lava below you, sheets of timed screen filling instant death lava from above (which wasn't bad in the original stage you first saw them) and you have to use a property of a weapon never once explained to you to enhance your jumps to ensure that you can outrace a stage gimmick that has gone from fun to a waking nightmare. Then once the lava is done you get more spikes and fast instant death flamethrowers that never actually deactivate (see also Quick Man's instant death beams from Mega Man 2) that require more use of the weapon property nobody told you about and reflexes of a god which, even if you were a deity, would be tired by this point as you've died about 30 times from the horrible instant death nightmare.Once that's done, however, you get an insulting easy boss, as if to pat you on the head for not throwing your PC out of a window in a fit of anger from the horrors you just experienced.Fortress 3 is draining mentally and is out to crush your will to ever finish the game. It is there not to challenge you, but to torment you, to beat you down and try to break you. There is no fun in this, only mind numbing tedium, the kind of thing you find in I Wanna Be The Guy, only jacked up just a little more. Somebody wanted to outdo them and claim the title of worst possible stage design from Mega Man X6... and they did.This game goes from scratching an itch you so desperately need to crushing your will to live within a few hours, and I am sadly beyond the point where I can get a refund. I cannot in good conscious condone this sort of thing, where the designer of this stage missed the point of Nintendo Hard so much that they went into territory that even the most horrid of ultra hard nonsense fan hacks (collectively called kaizo even though the meaning of the way has no inherent inclinations toward soul murdering difficulty spikes) would be jealous of. Do not, for the love of all that has ever existed, subject yourself to this unless you are masochistic enough to enjoy these sorts of things."
,Recommended,467850,23246760,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,OriginalVin,"You already know what you're in for when looking at this, right? Like Legend of Dark Witch (another highly recommended Mega Man-like Run n' Gun for super cheap) this is a basically a gender swapped Mega Man. It's a retro-style run n' gun platformer pitting your mechanized heroine against a bunch of Android ""Gals"" vs. Mega Man's various dude Robot Masters (excluding MM9's Splash Woman).  Unlike Dark Witch, which adds in it's own ideas (like a Gradius style upgrade bar) this one sticks to the MM formula pretty much exclusively. But it does pretty well!Visually it looks fantastic; the pixel art here and the color palette used is as good as, or better than, genuine SNES/Genesis/Amiga quality. The chibi character art really evoke cute, Japanese sidescrollers from the era. The quality of the chiptunes is great too. Controls are absolutely on point. They're super responsive and tight; it feels great with a 360 controller. The levels are very well designed, with areas being themed around various classic MM stage hazards like timed drop platforms, flame throwers and conveyor belt sections. Once you defeat the four main Gals and move onto the levels beyond, they even start making great use of your powers! See a wall you seemingly can't get passed? Fire the black hole-thing at an enemy on the other side to switch places and warp over there! See a gap that's too large for a dash jump? Jump anyway, then use Magma Gal's Flame Dash to cross to the other side! A ladder you can't reach? Shoot out your Mines, then jump on them to use the explosion to give you a boost! It gets REALLY GOOD once you have all these powers; the levels know that, and are designed thusly.Meanwhile, enemies are positioned in ways and combinations that almost resemble an ""action puzzle""; they'll shoot bouncing projectiles to get you to move to certain safe spots or you'll be able to perfectly take them out one-at-a-time from certain vantage points. It's just like the good old days! Speaking of, the difficulty is tuned to be ""NES Hard""; really difficult, but never impossible and rewarding when conquered (and able to be more speedily conquered after you get it down). Sit there and watch patterns, try different weapon & ability combinations, or die and learn from failures when you try again: you WILL make progress... most of the time.There are *some* issues that affect the difficulty. The timing windows on some of this stuff is absolutely brutal (particularly the fullscreen flame throwers in the second half of Magma Gal's stage and the explosive, timed platforms on Buster Gal's stage), enemies respawn THE SECOND you leave their ""screen"" (there's definitely places you can stand still that will cause them to continuously fly in from the edge of the screen, one after the other. Kind of good for grinding, but awful for combat where you have to maneuver in the air while jumping).EDIT: The developer is doing a good job currently of patching and otherwise updating this game constantly. Issues I had a week ago (I previously mentioned no way to change the controller config here) are no longer here! Meanwhile, the balance on things seem to be constantly tweaked for the better. I definitely have to give a shout-out to the devs for continually polishing this up!In the end, I just have a tiny issue with everything. Namely, the music compositions are a little repetitive (they all seem to be variants of the same song to me). But this game is $4 so I know its petty to bring up. What's here sounds good, but it bares mentioning anyway.That's it. Every other little issue I had is now gone :D--Overall, it's definitely recommended if you're looking for a cheap Mega Man style run-n'-gun retro action game. This is an extremely well-crafted little game and definitely provides the fun and challenge you're looking for. This title could absolutely go for $10 and it would put some other games in that price range to shame. RetroRevolution has a quality game here for the price of a sandwich at Burger King. I hope this isn't the last we see of Meta Gal :)"

Either that or they aren't using the tools given to them. Recommend to anyone who is a fan of megaman or retro platformers.Pros:Authentic megaman feel, with out being a complete clone.Good retro style music and visual, with out cheaping out and going 8 bit.Special weapon system is better than megaman's and gives incentive to actually use it outside of boss fights.Unique life sistem that keeps the game from beeing to frustrating, for the most part.Can play as the other 4 main bosses.Only $4.Cons:Only 8 levels + the training area.Fortress 3 and the final boss are rage inducing.Story drops off after the tutorial level, and doesn't really do much until the ending.No story at all when playing as the other GALsIf they do a sequal, I hope they rely a bit less on the insta death traps and flesh out the story more, as well as add a few more leves. Also, drop the end level boss rush. It wasn't fun when megaman did it, and it isn't fun here."

Nothing special or unique, and not very long, but not really that *bad* either.  There are positives, though for each positive there's a counterbalance;- The graphics are not bad at all, evoking a kind of 16-bit Megaman feel, and the character designs are pretty cute, but there's nothing that really stands out;- The music is quite good, sometimes rather great even, but most the game uses a singular motif that can get tiring, and the sound effects are stock trash (with especially bad mini voice clips in the cutscenes);- The story is... okay, servicable for this type of game, but the Engish translation and even the formatting of the text in the boxes is embarrassingly bad;- The gameplay overall is fine, and satisfying enough for a Megaman fan, but there are some very annoying aspects such as even your default pea shooter taking ammo and shooting only in three-round bursts for some reason (though these problems are SLIGHTLY alleviated via the hidden powerups you can find).There's also a weird lack of polish that I feel somewhat bothered by, with things like very swift screen transitions with no boss intro or 'got a weapon' outro to the stages, and how SOME dialogue scenes are skippable while others aren't.  It's also a painfully short game, with four challenging, but quick normal stages each with eactly 1 hidden powerup, followed by 4 'fortress' stages, and that's it, that's the whole game.  Very cut and dry.Still, though, all things considered, and especially with the price being so low frankly, for a Megaman fan this just barely,baaaaarelymakes the cut to be worth checking out, especially with the promise of more content such as various playable characters later on.  All things considered though, if you're looking for a good Megaman fangame where you play as a girl, you'd do better checking out Rosenkreuzstilette, Rokko Chan or MegaMari."

Because I literally sat here and spent about six minutes trying to figure out how to begin this.So. Straight out of the gate. is Metagal worth a buy? Yes. Is Metagal the shining successor to Mega Man? No. But it's still fun.I feel bad for Metagal because it journeys into the ever dangerous territory of ""Clone"". It's a Mega Man clone, through and through, but it still does enough on its own to merit its own accolades. But because it's a clone, the Mega Man fanbase will sink their claws into this and tear it apart. Follow me now...Metagal's story is classic Mega Man: scientist makes robots, bad guy repurposes them. Metagal is the only bot in town to save the day! There's some ProtoMan flavored subplots thrown in, but it's all just whatever. You shoot bad bots. That's all you need.At it's core, Metagal works. You jump. You shoot. You use special attacks to defeat enemies and traverse the stages. Cool. Just like MM. Nearly everything about the game is a direct lifting from MM: level design, ladder climbing, doors opening, enemy design, using certain weapons against bosses due to their weaknesses, etc. There are some differences, though: Metagal fires in three shot bursts. No single shots, no charges. Just bursts. Different, a little weird here and there, but pleasantly different. Instead of finite weapon ammo, Metagal gets an ever recharging gauge. This adds a nice touch to the tried and true gameplay we know from MM, so I welcomed it. There are only four bosses to gain special weapons from, two of which are incredibly useful, so not having to worry about finding ammo power-ups was a nice change of pace.Here's a big deal: you have infinite lives. You have. Infinite. LIVES. For anyone that writes this game a negative review because it's ""too hard"" or because ""Fortress Area 3 is too hard"", please remember that you have infinite lives. You do. Granted, you respawn back at every check point you pass, and you can techinically earn lives (Rebirths) that respawn you at the exact room you died in, but listen: infinite lives, infinite continues. For anyone who grew up playing OG action games, you'll know what that actually means.And really, Metagal isn't that hard. I beat it in a single two hour sitting, even collecting all of the hidden power-ups. Died a few times here and there, took me a while to figure out to beat the final boss' first form, but I did it. It's doable. The graphics were colorful and the music not terrible. so it was a pleasant ride. If you can find this on sale, give it a whirl. While it's no Mega Man 6 (my personal favorite), it's certainly a playable and enjoyable action platformer in its own right."
,Not Recommended,467850,27908113,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,DistGenius,"As a fan of the original NES Mega Man games, I cannot recommend this.  The graphics are cute, sure, and many of the enemies have a Mega Man feel to them, but overall the package is just lacking.The music is lackluster, the level design is atrocious (the 3 I tried all felt like variations on Shadow Man's Revisit stage in MM3, which is not a flattering comparison), and while the ""soft-death"" features sounds good on paper, the level design seems to be based around you dying to something you didn't know about instead of allowing you to decipher what to do as you progress.  Other minor nitpicks was that I was unable to fire single shots with the 360 controller (pressing the shoot button fired a 3-round burst which prevented me from shooting again until some shots impacted an enemy or left the screen) and that the control was way too floaty for the amount of precision expected.The one boss fight I made it to was...okay...at best.  She didn't have a pattern in the typical Mega Man styling.I'm not sure what the intent was here.  In terms of difficulty, METAGAL doesn't do the Dark Souls ""Git Gud"" concept well enough for the deaths to feel fair, but it also feels like if you take away the really, really weird difficulty that the game would have almost no content.  If you really want to play Mega Man style games, the Mega Man Legacy Collection or Shovel Knight will serve you much better than this game."

Personally I think in some aspects it's better than Shovel Knight, another game people like to claim is a spiritual successor to Mega Man. For one thing, the stage select, and power up feature is more Mega Man than anything Sovel Knight did. The dash feature is my personal favorite part of this game as it's just as free flowing and smooth as it is in Mega Man X (My favourite game of all time), and the boss fight patterns are very Mega Man classic. No charge shot though (except at the cost of your weapon energy meter and it's not worth it). A excellent platformer for under five bucks with a high enough difficulty and replay value to keep you invested far longer than it's price point would have you expect."

Rebirth not 100% what it does but it is a life system. Check points are really far apart compared to the amount of instant death traps in the game.Says it is mapped for controllers.

Sure the bosses, enemies and levels fall into predictable patterns, but so did mega man. Half the fun was dominating the game completely when you learned the patterns. I won’t say I raved over the music, but it was alright. One thing you can definitely tell is that it was built with the control pad in mind.

Expect Mega Man, for the most part.I did like how abilities work, and anticipated getting a new one due to the fact that a lot of them help you get around the stages (like Warp Gal's weapon swaps the places between you and an enemy it hit).I liked the sprite work, although felt it lacked color, but this might be my own preferences toward the 8-Bit Mega Man games.The story is pretty basic, although I liked the attempts to give it color by injecting humor, although I'd have referenced some common Mega Man oddities (like why do they all have a Fortress?). The English was also a bit wonky, but the devs said English isn't their first language, so I can't criticize that.The difficulty was hard, as a Mega Man throwback usually is, although sometimes I thought the game got pretty unfair, although those are usually late-game (the pseudo-Quick Man lasers particularly annoyed me in the third Creeper stage).

However there are some problems1: The weapons you get are usefull but the fire dash is flawed.You  expect a fire dash to go through enemies but its not the case here. If the oppenent doesn't die with the dash you will get hit. However you want to get this weapon highlighted all the time cause you never know when you are gonna need it in the final stages.2:The level design is okay for the most part but the gravity girls stage is broken. Help yourself and get the fire dash before this stage you are gonna need it.3:Checkpoint system in this game is really stupid. I hate it. You see how it works is that there are 2 types of checkpoints.One is visible on the screen one is not. You only get to use the invisible ones if you have these gold  gears that you can find in the stages. Its a pointless comcept in my opinion because if you run out of these (especially in castle level number 2) you will have re-do a lot of the level again. If they just made the invisible checkpoints like the visible ones this problem would not exist.4: The music is good but not memorable. It does its job but I don't think I will ever listen to these in real life.5:Some of the enemy placements are kinda bad.By that I mean they are in your way when you are about to land on a platform or worse a platform that closes and opens.(gravity stage I hate you)MY BIGGEST PROBLEM:You see in this game shooting is kinda weird. When you press the attack button you will automaticly shoot 3 shots. This is a problem because I can shoot faster than this. I know its sounds stupid but trust me you will notice it while playing it.Aiming with this when you jump is kinda hard.And again you can shoot faster than this so lets say you are walking to an enemy and you are confident that you can shoot fast enough (just like in megaman) and kill the enemy but that wont happen. Most of the enemies take at least 2 sets of shot too.Other than these the game is pretty good. Nothing amazing though. As a technical megaman player I rather play something like Mighty no 9 I won't lie (though I know I am gonna get a lot of hate for saying that).

I have completed the game and now I try to improve my records on every stage, which means I have a good overview of the game. The game takes most of its elements from the Megaman videogame series but the point is that it improves a lot of these elements further. It provides a challenge without being devilishly difficult (+supports the player) and has a lot of great gameplay mechanics which vary among the stages (and a lot of clever level-design ideas too). Fortunately, you won't actually meet the cheap deathtraps that overwhelm the Megaman stages. I also liked the fact that the abilities you earn aren't just variations of your buster but completely different gadgets and ""augumentations"" that evolve your character's actions. Lastly, I loved the soundtrack of the game (it's just amazingly crafted) and the artwork during some of the cutscenes. The only minor negative I noticed were some small glitches here and there, but you may hardly find them during playing the game. Some may feel that there should be more stages, but I believe that the total duration of the game is fairly good given it's price. It's been quite a while since I had so much fun fighting epic bosses and shooting my way through a 2D action platformer (and I played ""Megaman and Bass"" last month). As a closing comment: those of you who can't stand the high difficulty of the Megaman videogames but would love to play something very close to the series' gameplay, this is just the game worth spending your money on."

This being said, I want to like this. I see a lot of potential in METAGAL, but the controls do need some more polishing. The overall feel of the game is like an NES emulator running at a higher speed than usual, making simple things like dash-jumps and even attacking while jumping a chore.The visual style is retro, which is part of the charm of these types of games. The music... I can't say I played long enough to fully comment on; the controls and/or ""speed"" of the game made me want to quit playing.As the game is now, I can't say I'd recommend it, but as a work-in-progress, I'll be looking forward to seeing what new updates bring.

If you want the unforgiving difficulty then sure this might actually be the game for you. Perhaps it was the fact I was using a keyboard instead of controller that increased the difficulty I am not sure but After the Megaman X series I got spoiled. Wall climbing/jumping... thats what this game need. There are a ton of places to fall to your death, spikes and the enemies hit HARD. It is also poorly translated there are several places where gramma have compleatly been ignored.I would rather do open heartsurgery on myself with a dull spoon than play this game. However if unforgiving games are your thing go for it, if you enjoy Megaman X above The Classic Megaman because of the mobility of the character then stay the heck away from this game, you will facepalm so much that your braincells will belive it is judgment day.So Overall: Graphics 7/10, Gameplay 3/10, Story 4/10."

This is something every game developer needs to do and usually takes up more than 50% of development time: Polish your ♥♥♥♥ing game.

There's a reason this game is only being sold for four dollars, and it's not because the dev is generous!Unfortunately, people will still pay for games that are newgrounds-tier quality because they have so little standards that they'll take anything instead of asking for better games, because eventually, developers who want money are gonna have to listen to the majority.

A rather glaring issue really.English clearly isn't the developer's native language, but its coherent enough. (really who plays a megamania type game for the plot anyway?)Boss fight patterns can sometimes feel erratic, (especially final boss)i.e. Traditional pattern based boss fights are half done and it feels more like having to play quick reaction time And given the very pattern based style of bosses common in platforming games its....  jarringOne level has a very sudden very high difficulty spike (Tons of cheap instadeath)It has an overall unpolished feel, glitches will be present, hit detection can occasionally be offrespawning enemies faster than rabbits reproduce (occasionally causing headaches)The other GAL charachters almost break the game with being OP, but some may think thats a good thing (Warp GAL OP as all get out)OverallA cheap little megaman clone platformer that does ok, but doesn't really excel all that much, but has its moments.

Is this the meaman remake we all wanted? subjective... Long story short this game changes many things that I personally like, but arent megaman so I can see a fan getting upset about them.the two biggest changes are the weapons systems for the boss weapons, and the lives system.For weapons there is a slowly recharging bar, and hitting secondary fire when its full fires your charge shot. If you have a boss weapon and have it equiped, you still fire your normal shot and your secondary fire shoots off the boss weapon. now you cant use it all the time thanks to a ten second charge, but there is no worry about running out of ammo when you really need it like classic megamanFor lives they are rare as normal, but you have unlimited continues... so what is the point of lives? continuing dosnt take a life but there is a 'reborn' option that uses them. if you chose to be reborn, you will instead respawn at the start of the room rather than the start of the level. Perfect for when you die after a long streach by accedently letting go of jump too soon. Oh and you cant use reborn to tank the bosses, as reborn spawns you in the previous room for bosses... where a checkpoint is anyway.few more minor complaints, METAGAL feels a bit heavier than megaman... there is a fat chick joke somewhere. Oh speaking of the gender swap, the story feels like a guy who didnt know how to write for women wrote it. Luckly it is less them obsessing about boys and more GirlPowerTM which I find more bearable. On the plus side, just like classic megaman, the story is there for the beginning and the end... and thats it so it is very easy to ignore.If that all sounds good, then know this game is scratching that megaman itch I have been having for a while. At the time of this review I have seen there are 3 other playable characters to unlock, 8 or so stages to play and probably more unlocked after those. level design is fun, and I occasonaly get surprised by some level design I wasnt expecting.I have been having fun, It is nowhere near the likes of shovel knight, however it is good enough that it could be compared to shovel knight. If the devs see this than please keep this up. I would love to see a sequel in the future(unless there is one I just dont know about) or even some other classic games remade with the same love and care. Classic Castleveina for instance... or maybe Secret of Mana... just saying"
