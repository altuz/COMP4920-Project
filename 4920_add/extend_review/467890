So far every attempt at providing a drumming experience in VR has been a miserable failure, and this is no exception.There are some serious issues that may not be surmountable. Foot pedals are essential; without feet you can't do much but play the bongos. Precision collision detection is essential - when a stick pixel lightly brushes a cymbal pixel there has to be a reaction, otherwise all sense of presence, interaction and tactility disappears. Velocity and weight must be accounted for, and not just one or two 'settings', but a full range of dynamic force detection that alters not just volume but also the tone and timbre of the instrument struck. Similarly, the different parts of each instrument must make different sounds; hitting the rim of the cymbal and the bell should sound recognizably different.But perhaps most important of all, and the point which makes me doubt the ability of VR to ever simulate drums well, the sticks need to bounce off a reactive surface. Without a surface to work off, most of the technique of drumming is gone - no dragging, no rapid percussion, no way to develop fluid rhythm. Not to mention the strain that constantly arresting your hand movement and drawing it back up (non-drummers might not realize that much of the energy of drumming comes from the force of gravity+rebound); long-term this is a recipe for wrist ligament damage.TLDR: VR drumming is like playing basketball without a floor"

At it's core it's probably a flawed concept due to lack of pedals, and triggers don't do it nearly enough justice (especially as typically you manipulate your sticks using those fingers!)  Feels like this could cause beginner drummers to develop really poor practices if they started with this.Thought it'd be a fun little toy to play around with and do some basic beats, but I can barely get that out of it.  I'm curious what someone really practiced on this would sound like, but even the trailer video shows how difficult and sloppy it is to play.Really wanted to like this, but ultimately it's just not what I was hoping it would be."

It's very good that you have lots items to pick up, but I don't think that it's realy important in drum simulator.Browser and youtube are not conveniently, I always missed search line and always browser spawns through roof or under floor.All I liked here is environment. Drums sound also could be better. Look how it made in Drums Hero or DrumKit VR"

,Recommended,467890,23682759,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,SlurpyDurpy,"It's a very interesting idea and a something new for my VR. It's still in early access so I hope they will improve on quite a few things. At the moment when you hit the drums it's a bit like hitting a button, it plays the same sound no matter what. In future I hope they will add more technical detail to it, like difference in sound depending on how hard you smash it, being able to drag the stick on the surface and hear the sound it makes. But as it stands in it's current state it's still a very much so functioning drummer set. This however is definitely not a ""game"" there are no objectives and so on, so if you plan on buying this just know that it's a drum set, not guitar hero. They have a board in the game with upcoming features, and they sound very promising."

(none of my other titles feel this way)The in game browser didnt work either, it comes up, but just sits there un-responsive.The idea is fantastic, but an idea isnt enough, this needs a lot of work.I understand its early access, and you should too if you get it.Ive had early access titles before, and they at least worked."
,Not Recommended,467890,29098339,Posted: 7 January,all,wgren,"Now that there is a new Vive Tracker accessory on the way you can hopefully simulate pedals, but the other big problem remains and I don't see any way for the devs to get around it - you don't get tactile feedback when hitting the drums in VR, and sometimes you get an annoying double sound when you move the drumstick up again through the virtual drum. I had to carefully poke the surface with the stick, which doesn't feel half as fun or real as for instance playing the Guitar Hero drums."

Garage Drummer VR shows incredible promise even in this early, unpolished version. It's a virtual drumkit! Wanted one of these since I first bought a Vive and it costs less than a meal at Taco Bell.After about 15 minutes of playing around I was able to work out a good, steady beat and even a bit of fill. I never thought it would be so intuitive after such a short time.The cons:- Text is terribly aliased, unreadable in any of the graphic options.- The menu selection is fidgety. Clicked on the garage door opener half a dozen times before anything happened. Same for graphics selection.- I know there's a snare rim hit but I can't hit it accurately.- No spatial audio. Everything sounds mono.What I'd like to see in future updates:- Metronome adjustment- Deperately needs a loop recorder/player so I can build on basic beats. Loop recorder should have adjustable beat time.- A way to move, add drums to the set- A way to adjust the room around the player like Pool Nation does. Frankly this should be a part of every VR experience from now on. It's that good.- Programmable, importable drum sounds/effects.- Love the top/bottom hit on the cymbals, reproduces a great roll effect with one hand. Want to see that on drums too.- Reprogrammable buttons, PLEASE!"

,Recommended,467890,24299458,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,The Illegible Poet,pretty cool game although I'm not convinced playing the drums translates really well to VR.  Very fun if you just want something to screw around on.  I made a 1.5 minute video review here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAf1rkffYFU

Subtle movements (and you can see the sticks doing it, showing the system's doing it), aren't reacted to by the drums well. Also, the interface (switch on wall, for example) seems almost un-interactable. Interface needs work."

I can easily put on some music streaming and drum till my arms go out.One complaint though, why does the game launch with the drums facing away from the ""front"" direction? For people who have less than perfect room tracking this can be quite a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ An option to move/rotate the set will be very handy!"

I hope theres some type of  ""light up rhythm"" teaching mechanic or something in the future because I am terrible at timing and motor coordination. In all honesty I shouldn't have purchased this because I can't play real drums to save my life, but I assume it's a good simulation because I'm awful at it too."

,Recommended,467890,24039113,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Malys,"Very promising program so far!  As a little tip, you can alt+tab out of Garage Drummer, open your own music player (winamp etc.) and play along to songs. It's understandably a little basic program right now with a single same volume sound per kit piece, but still very much fun. I can't wait for the rest of the features to show up like ability to use USB pedal for kick drum and velocity of the hits altering the sound the drum makes. My only pet peeve right now is that the toms and cymbals seem to trigger double hits rather easily if you pull your controller back through the surface, not sure if it's a bug or a feature. Maybe a tickbox option on the wall for if you want it behaving that way or not? Anyway, it's a solid program and well worth the price already. With lessons, multiplayer and all the other features on the way, you really can't go wrong with this."

I find the kick drum on the trigger a little awkward but you can get used to it.  It does what it says on the tin, its a drum kit in a garage.  If you would have fun with this in the real world then give it a shot.  Some tutorials and maybe playing along with songs would help new drummers keep intrest in it perhaps.  Looking forward to see where this goes in the future"
