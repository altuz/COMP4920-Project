76561198049937609,Recommended,467900,24508890,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,Majeflyer,"*Update on mouse and keyboard*Mouse and keyboard now work, it feels like a great use of the mouse... though controllers will always feel better, there is just one more reliable player to play the game at your parties... single player experience is ""there"" but not satisfying/fun enough to purchase the game for a SP experience. Multiplayer is still great.*Review made a few days after EA release*Swordy is not for every PC, make no mistake, Swordy is a niche game requiring Multiple controllers (with the recent and solid addition of Keyboard and mouse) , Friends, and a willingness to wait until those meetups to play the game... (and it only really starts getting fun with a third (or more) person(s) too)...To those having a Party with a few friends around, Must grab.To those looking for a single player experience, Don't get it yet, Wait a few months and see how the single player modes progress and then re-evaluateSwordy is a Unique ""Arena Party Game"" In the vein of ""Starwhal"" or ""Duck Game"" or ""SpeedRunners"". They are great, fun, and silly... though there's a few drawbacks out there.Most of these Arena party games are platformers... and too many people have WAAAY different skill levels in platformers to make them fun or fair.This game is a lot more like starwhal ""new"" control scheme, a game where most people are unfamiliar with the controls, starting everyone off on a level playing field.What this game has going for it is a really strong sense of ""Honourable combat"", ""Casual rulemaking"" and ""Improvisation mid combat""""Looking at each other across the arena, blood has been spilled, but both your weapons are aflame... the rain starts... everything else seems to fade into the background, Slowly spinning up the hammer, charging forwards, both you and them start screaming...""Moments like that seem to flow and occur naturally, Blows and weapon exchanges seem just right, your opponents rarely outskill you to the point of futility, and when amazing dagger throws do happen, there's nothing but awe across the couch. It feels like one of the few local multiplayer games where battlecries feel appropriate and easy to do. The game is really good at encouraging ""epic memorable moments"", everything feels fair (even when it's unfair).The game is also nice in offering casual rulemaking. You have an immediately apparent unspoken social contract for politeness, a weapon selection as required, not needing to go into a ""Mutators screen"" to disallow certain items... as most friends are amiable to not allow swords, or to only go for punches, or overhead attacks... it's just really nice and refreshing not having to go back out to a menu to get that stuff done.It's also really nice to see a bit of panic mode support, where your thrown weapon misses the target, and now you're running away from a psycho with a flaming spear, grabbing and tossing everything in your path to try escape... until either you manage to pick up another dagger and fling it at him... hopefully with a little more luck this time... or you run into a wall and get skewered...Really, this is just an essential party game that doesn't lose it's lustre quickly, Get it if you're sick of platformers as your only party game options for sure. Get it if you're the type that can convince their friends to bring two controllers over.Remember that you hold X while picking up to dual wield!"

It ends up just being ""walk into people and jab them and hope to get lucky."" And I generally love stupid party games like this. This one is just so bland and pointless."
76561198035140839,Recommended,467900,33663321,Posted: 19 July,all,Big Henry,"I bought this game specifically to play with a few friends on the couch.  It is a lot of fun with a few controllers and a few friends.I get that it is early access and not all the content is there but my friends and I would play this game for a bit, play something else, and eventually end up coming back to this one because it was just too much fun.It's great to practice all the different weapons ranging from hammers, axes, swords, daggers, spears, and flails.  Each one plays differently and requires a unique tactic.We got fairly bored of the ""kill everyone"" game so we came up with our own ideas for keeping the game interesting.- Give one player armor and two weapons.  The other players do not have armor and only weapon.  Juggernaut versus everyone else!- Nothing but hammers.  Everyone brings two hammers into the arena.  The catch is you can only use them by throwing.  No meleeing allowed.  This was by far my favourite game mode.Fun little made up game modes like this kept things interesting and we kept coming back.The physics works fantastically, the graphics worked well for what it is, and I never had any problems with the game crashing.Even though it is early access I would recommend this game if you are looking for a fun little brawler to play with friends on the couch."

,Not Recommended,467900,33409085,Posted: 9 July,all,Nebulous,"(DISCLAIMER: I played this offline on my living room PC, so I probably have about 2 hours in this game.)SWORDY just has nothing to offer you after the inital goofy-ness of the combat wears off. It is fun to try everything out, but that will maybe take you a half hour. I get its early access, but there just really isn't any content right now to warrant a purchase. I do hope that this game gets more fledged out and has more things to keep you playing. If that happens, I would gladly re-purchase this game. However, I will have to refund it for now since I know it will not make it into my couch party line-up.It really is a shame, because I have nearly 100 couch-multiplayer games in my steam library. This game is a fun idea, and I really want to support couch-multiplayer games that are not just 2D Smash-esque fighters. I'm hoping the best for the devs of this game, but to the consumer: Hold off on your purchase for now. Maybe later."

This game currently has AIs and a coop AND versus system for other players.Now so far, the updates that are being released alone are showing me that this game was definitely worth the amount I spent when it was ON SALE. But currently, I personally think it fits its 15$ price tag. So, if you've got some extra cash lying around, and wanna play a local game with your mates, go ahead and get this game."

,Recommended,467900,26741830,"Posted: 21 November, 2016",all,Effgee,"Check out the gameplay video below to see how the game plays:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDkzdNiRc0cWhat is it?Swordy is a top-down physic brawler made primarily for local multiplayer.  Players can pick up a variety of weapons and swing them or hack away to try and bring down their opponents.  It does have single player aspects such as the ability to play against bots and single-player 'missions' which are fun but the real bread and butter of the game lies in a bunch of friends smashing each other with hammers for laughs.How does it play?The game plays smoothly.  Controls are easy to understand but challenging to master.  There doesn't appear to be any keyboard control (at least, not that I could find) but the game seems to really suit a controller anyway, being clearly designed for twin stick control.Who would enjoy it?If you like to play casual games with a group of friends, I can see you having a great time with this.  If stuff like Ultimate Chicken Horse or Overcooked are your thing, then this will be right up your alley.Pros:+ Crisp, responsive controls.+ Really nice design aesthetic+ Good variety of weapons with different physics/feeling.+ Dev team seems to be very active and involved in progressing the game.Cons:- UI is a bit clunky and unclear to navigate.- No online multiplayer support (and I don't think this is something that will be implemented).- The shader really impacts upon frame rate (I don't have a top end graphics card (AMD HD7970) and I could still get 55 fps or so but my framerate pretty much doubled when I turned off the shaders entirely).Overall, if you like local multiplayer brawlers, this is well worth your time, IMHO."

,Recommended,467900,30873264,Posted: 1 April,all,Entente,"""Gang beasts meets gladiator combat... best local multiplayer game on PC that I have played in a while."" - This was my review from April 1st 2017, that was 3 and a half months ago, and that statement I made has changed alot since then. Although I still love playing this game, it's still very slapstick, but humorously complex at the same time. SWORDY isn't a complex game, far from it, but the complexity comes from gruge matchs and LMS's between the last two or the last round, and the on the fly tactics you make as you go along, trying to win.The game is fun in short brusts, which is the main reason I retract the ""best local multiplayer game on PC that I have played in a while"" statement. In my eyes the 5 main compontents of a couch-coop game are (in my order of importance):- Teamwork/Rivaly (✓)- Long Play Sessions (✕)- Replayable (✓/✕)- Strong Concept (✓)- Sense of Progress (✕)If you know you can play this game frequently with friends and you like the concept, get it, but if you are looking for the best on the market right now, I would recommend Ultimate Chicken Horse. That's not to say I hate this game, I love it at times, but its simply too inconsistent to play sparingly."

,Not Recommended,467900,26618830,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,Windows 98,"Certainly not a bad game. It's a bit slow-paced, especially when compared to it's other 8-player local multiplayer competitors such as knight squad and gangbeasts. It has potential too, it is very polished and colorful and the mechanics work, but it just feels slow. My group of friends played a few rounds and quickly decided to move on to something a bit more comical. I give it a 6/10. Perhaps they will add more in the future and make it catch my eye. Until then."
