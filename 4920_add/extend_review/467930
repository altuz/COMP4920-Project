,Recommended,467930,23013397,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,ShinTheKnight,"Smashing the Battle is a generic 3D beat-em-up that probably draws people in with the anime style, and the unusually large cleavage of the various characters showcased.I streamed this game on Steam during the first 2 hours of launch, and was informed that this was a port of a mobile smartphone game only available in Korea.Gameplay was pretty standard, I guess you could say this plays like a single player version of Dota 2. The game's limited skillset has a couple of cooldowns and SP requirements. You are unable to obtain new skills, only upgrade the stats of your available skills.Other things to mention about the game:Repetitive gameplay: You will be fighting the same monsters, using the same actions with very little to no variety of gameplay.Keyboard controls: For those who are unable to use a controller, the default keyboard controls are pretty bad. The main problem being generic movement is mapped to arrow keys, and not WASD These controls can not be re-mapped. (Resolved as of 5/18/2016)No quality options: The game will simply play in fullscreen, stretched to your monitor's resolution. No questions asked. (Resolved as of 5/18/2016)Not many options for alternate costumes: Only about 5 total for the main character, including the starting armor.The game itself runs... pretty well for me. I haven't had any game crashes, noticed any strange bugs, and runs just fine at a locked 60fps.So I'd say this game is pretty average at best. Average, but worth the $12 asking price ($10.19 for the first week sale).Now maybe they can use the money they made from selling this game to... buy a license to use Unity?"
,Recommended,467930,23013513,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,Ivan Osorio,"Hour 1: A few first impressions from ground zero:Pretty great, actually. I was sort of expecting a button masher, but the combat mechanics are in fact well developed. You got your dodges, invincibility frames, special attacks and situational skills, different modes that increase your damage output for a decrease in defense. Good stuff here. The AI is a bit brain dead so far but it's not like I've played very far into it yet. The challenge modes seem pretty brutal though, and there are a lot of them, which I appreciate.As a whole, Smashing The Battle reminds me a lot of Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae, a game which I really really like. And amongst many common traits, they also share the ""virtue"" of being well executed packages with fun gameplay.The camera can be a bit wonky, it tends to end up turning bird-eye view, but it's easy to correct, even in the middle of battle. Nonetheless, it could definitely have used some better tracking. But as I understand it, this is supposed to be played in VR? I don't own or have any interest in one of those so I wouldn't be able to tell you how that works, but apparently it's there if that matters to you. It may either resolve or exacerbate the camera problems, I have no idea.I wanted to leave this here as a ""congratulations"" to the developer, the game plays and runs great. He is also pretty on point with support, so that's definitely a plus. But also, I wanted to leave a word on the gameplay, since I bet a lot of people are going to see breasts and either immediately buy it or immediately dismiss it, which sometimes works but would be a shame here. This game deserves an honest shot.Hour 2: Some additional thoughts:A few mechanics are not as well explained as they should be. I have yet to figure out what is the purpose of ""Scrap"", even though I got a bunch of it.I don't get the ""point"" (gameplay wise) of saving people. They don't seem to give tremendous resources and their Keys could be spent unlocking stuff, at least in the early game,EDIT:Rescued workers have a really high chance of giving you another key when released. Always save them!The rating system is a bit weird, and easily exploitable. Getting ""Massive Kills"" sometimes feels like it just fails, I have no idea what a ""killstreak"" is in the context of this game, but this is the only star that I always get, and the dodge counter, while cool, is not particularly well implemented. You can farm environmental hazards for those, or leave just a few enemies alive and farm them. So far, the numbers are always the same as well, and it feels like a missed opportunity. Have a stage where the requirement was to dodge a bunch of attacks would have been interesting, or clearing a stage without getting hit.Or under a time limit. The current system works fine enough as it is, but since the missions are already all pretty similar (as far as I can tell, which is not a lot) aside from the starting dialogue, not having more unique mission requirements feels odd.EDIT:There are different missions types. Most seem to be just arena type scenarios, you go in and get locked until everyone is dead, but some are waves, which I had already encountered but had forgot about, and I just stumbled upon a timed mission, which was nice. Even though the timer was actually really lenient I appreciate the change of pace. Good stuff.I'm looking forward to unlocking the other character as well as the ability to get extra costumes.Hour 3: Other things I noticed after playing a bit more:Very nice difficulty curve. You start off with very easy and passive enemies but before long you are getting swarmed and fired upon from every possible direction. Situational awareness and good dodging become key, as well as efficient crowd control. Environmental hazards that are first introduced as simple obstacles along your path show up in later encounters and even boss battles, sometimes combined. Having to dodge spinning lightning rods, while the field is on fire, while a bunch of robots fire a ton of projectiles at me gave the game a very interesting vibe, almost bullet-hell -ish, but the punishment is never as severe. I have died when I got careless though, it certainly proved to not be the cakewalk that I thought it would be. Of course, you could always grind stages and upgrade the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your everything. Personally, I feel I've struck a nice balance.I think I'll let this review be for a while and continue further into the game. I will probably update yet again once more stuff opens up and I have a better picture of the game as a whole. It's been very fun so far though. Definitely recommended.Hour 9: Closing thoughts on the whole experience:So... I've now cleared both campaigns, played for a while. It starts pretty easy and stupid, the difficulty ramps up quite nicely and the last stages had me locked in the zone of situational awareness that few games can pull off right. I was surprised and pleased that upwards until level 25 of the second campaign (which would make it level 55 in general) the game was still introducing new attack patterns or expanding on older ones. It was really refreshing and made the last stretch of the game feel very tense as the bullet count on screen rose considerably. I also came to really like the camera going bird's-eye view because that IS the best view to deal with multiples incoming shots from every possible direction. Since attacks are telegraphed mostly by patterns on the floor, having a top-down view can seriously save you. So, yes. Camera. Actually pretty great.The characters do play differently and required, at least in my experience and playstyle, different approaches to gameplay. With Sarah, I would usually gather enemies around with the magnets and try to clear them with the Great Spanner, her special attack, while evading anything I can for an SP boost, but her standard combo attack is pretty fast so I wasn't shy about getting in the face of enemies. I also never ever used her bombs. Mary's game for me was much more reliant on ""hit 1"" of her combo attack. Get in, hit, run. It was mostly an attrition game. I rarely used her ""remote bot"" with intents of exploding it, but as a means to get the surreal amount of fire off my back for a second so I could regroup.About dodging: I really like how it works. Dodging consumes a bit of SP every time you use it. It's mostly negligible, but if you are low on SP and can't use your special attacks or Heal, dodging is probably what you want to do to get some SP back, since performing an Evade Bonus nets you 20 SP. The thing is that if you just mash the button, you are going to cannibalize your own earnings. I really like this system. It's not strict enough to be really punitive and screw you over, but it also hampers you back just enough that you will try to do it better until you can pull it off consistently.""Massive Kills"" still baffle me. Is it a number of enemies thing? Is it a cumulative damage dealt over HP total of enemies thing? I have no idea. I THINK it's damage related but I have no idea on how it actually works. I've farmed a few stages and consistently killed some mobs the exact same way every time, and I got the massive kill bonus about 50% of those times. It's pretty weird.In retrospect, I think the additional suits have always been available for purchase, that's what ""scrap"" is for, but I never noticed as I never ""confirmed"" on the character selection screen before getting Mary. They are recolors, sadly, but they do come with special abilities. Running faster, increase in attack or defense. Etc. The bonuses are not the same from character to character, which I appreciate....I wish there was some sort of ""point refund"" system so I could try different builds or challenge runs.All in all? Pretty good. Takes a while to warm up but it's worth it."

What you see is what you get, nothing special, but at the same time, it has its charms. If you love what you see, get it, can't go wrong with this.There is no skill trees, no different weapons, nor equipments drops. You smash through the stages, get coins (for upgrading your stats), and scraps (for buying 8 different skins/costumes). You also get keys for unlocking lores, and fanarts.You get to play as 2 different characters. 1 is unlocked after finish the first one. Each has 110 stages to complete. (30 story / 80 challenge)Each character has 2 unique skills, and 3 basic skills. 1 move-set, 1 rolling attack. However, they are different in playstyles.You can find several power-ups during stages from boxes or enemies.Controls are responsive enough to keep you alive during the heavy fights, combat animations flow really well, although they lack some dynamics to keep the whole things fresh.Gameplay gets repetitive quickly, but still a good fun to play.Here is something which might be useful for your playthrough.* The multiple attack bonus can be earned by anykillsoccurred at the same time. Sometimes, you don't need a skill to do it, but normal attack should do the trick.* The dodge roll in SMASHING THE BATTLE uses iFrame. However, Sarrah, and Mary's iFrame kick in, and end at the different dodge frames. So, your roll is not invincible.* Dodge roll is not always a must. At times, moving around is much safer. (may not seem this way in story mode, but challenge mode is)* Smashing attack (rolling attack) is strong.* If in-game hints mentioned that something is important, it is important.* The collisions can be weird at times. You can roll into the invisible wall sometimes, however, you can walk through that area normally, and start rolling again.* Achievements can be earnedafteryou gets your reward in the missions menu (can be accessed from main menu), andleavethe game.

The combat, despite being a bit repetitive, is flashy and rewarding, all the characters are really well designed and the upgrade system is really simple and helps a lot as the story goes on. As far as story goes, there aren't exactly a whole lot of surprises, but the main characters make up for it with very human/relatable reactions and goals. Despite being a mobile game that was brought to Steam, the controls are very easy to figure out and all work really well, the frame rate is also incredibly smooth and satisfying. The tutorial character that guides you through out the game is really annoying and hard to sympathize with, but she doesn't detract from a solid hack and slash."

76561198006395100,Recommended,467930,23091246,"Posted: 19 May, 2016",all,Lavian,"Disclaimer: I'm not finished with the challenge mode of the game.My thoughts in a word: Decent.Let's starts off with the basic stuff:-The game has two characters, each with two unique special attacks and their own set of basic attacks and a different dodge animations. They share the ability to repair and an ability that pulls enemies to a sort of magnatism bomb.-The game has 60 story missions and 80 challenge missions, each of which take a few minutes. Nothing very long, but the amount of content is decent.-Enemy variety is good. There's a pretty interesting array of enemies ranging from weak melee fodder, to suicide bots, to laser bots, to arc fire bots, to homing bomb firing bots, and more. They're pretty varied and do a good job to keep you alert.- A notable mechanic is that your SP regenrates pretty slowly, but you get +20 for dodging through attacks, so it encourages you to actually pay attention to the timing on your dodges so you can keep using special attacks (and repairs) for drawn-out encounters.All of the above adds up to a genuinely fun game. That said, the place where the game falters is in boss design. Bosses are all just bigger versions of the normal enemies with a big radial AoE to keep you on your toes. They're not too hard to kill honestly, and they don't require you to change up your tactics much beyond watching out for the big purple circle AoE telegraph. The bosses are really pretty much as generic as the normal enemies, to the point that they're even reused (a lot). This means that between the mass of normal enemies and  lack of very interesting boss design, the game is pretty repetative.I mean, imagine taking your favorite beat-em-up and then remove all of the bosses from it and replace them with tankier/harder hitting versions of the normal enemies. It's probably still a decent amount of fun, but it's missing something. That's pretty much this game (for me so far). I do think this is the kind of thing that could be compensated for by wide player character variety (think Musou/Warriors style games), but this game doesn't have that either.Anyway, Smashing the Battle is worth a look, but it's not going to blow your mind."

Some things were not explained like what to do with the scrap you collect, it unlocks outfits that can provide different stat bonuses which was nice instead of them being purely for the ""art style"". Lots of unlockables including back story documents and fan art which I didnt bother to unlock all. The game sets itself to entice you to replay as much as possible for whatever your reason may be but after 5 hours of trying everything the game had to offer I still didnt feel the want to play more.

I found myself far more intrigued about the story that I ever thought I would, despite the lack of any true cutscenes. I have thus far played to the end of Sarah's story and will likely continue to play through Mary Lucy's story.The controls are simple and easy to pick up, but can perhaps be overly simple. There's only one attack button and a few special attacks, like mines, a big overhead slash, a magnet to suck in enemies, and a heal to repair yourself.If you're wanting some dumb fun with a bit of story to move along (and can deal with the visual novel level of cutscenes), give it a try.

,Recommended,467930,23191468,"Posted: 24 May, 2016",all,Scathy,"Let me start this off by saying that I have trouble finding good hack and slash style games, so Smashing The Battle is something that I enjoy to it's core just for being what it is. The game has Great Graphics, Nice Music, and plenty of  Unlockables. However when the game decides to ramp it's difficulty it ramps it's difficulty HARD. I went from breezing through the game to struggling to take out even a room full of enemies in no time flat. That isn't to say it's a bad game, it just doesn't understand how to ramp the difficulty. However when you do finally buy enough upgrades to take out the enemies in a room it does feel nice.The boss fights can be unfair at times. Most bosses have a move that can hit you within a huge AOE giving you little time to escape them, and no matter if you do or do not escape them they flash out a bunch of smaller AOE attacks at your current location. So at times if you don't avoid the initial AOE you WILL die to the smaller ones because your armor had been broken or you just don't have enough health. The game boasts two characters, however you have to beat the first character's story to unlock the second one.All in all, I enjoy the game for what it is. I could do with the scaling being a little more tame, and I hope that they will update the game to add another character, or just more variety. For it's pricetag SMASHING THE BATTLE is 100% worth the price of admission, at least in my eyes."

While the controls and flow of combat are quite good the problem is you'll be stuck with same moves fighting in the same envoirment over and over. While new enemies are introduced at a decent pace and do offer a nice bit of variety it's sadly the only real variety the game has to offer and sadly no enemy is truly paradigm shifting.Combat boils down to mash attack and dodge out the way every once in a while. Also your abilties are mapped to other buttons. It works well and it can be exhilarating to pull off a long combos of magnet, mines and dogding, however the lack attack combos and only one attack button can quicly make you wish for a little bit more in the combat. The game does offer a change of pace by way of a second unlockable character but only after pretty much beating the game. It would be nice if the game had two from the beginning unlocking more as you went on or least new weapons that offered a new move set, that would clear up the monotony.To adress the elepant in the room or perhaps better put the two heaving bosoms in the room, yes the game is male pandering fan service with it charcter desings. If your a fan of anime girls and or jiggle physics then you'll probably find some enjoyment in this game. It's honestly not as bad with it's pandering as other games, however thats not to says it's not pandering, I mean there's no real reason the game has to feature scantily clad women fighting robots but it does. It's pretty shameless about it too, so If you have a problem with kind of stuff really why are even bothering reading reveiws for the game. The tittle screen is the main character bouncing up and down jiggle physics and all. It is what it so lets move on from there.Lastly the graphic and presentation are really quite nice, the game is colorful and flashy but would really benifit from some superfical changes in envoirment, I mean why not levels like a basement with pipes and steam or like a data center with blinky lights and what not something to make you feel like progress is being made. The music and sound are ok but it could really be improved. For instance some level complete fanfair would be nice or sounds the indicate things like ablities being ready or power up wearing off. It serviceable but bare minimum in my opinion.With all that said the game is still good hack and slash fun with a nice futuristic anime fan service coat of paint. The gameruns and plays well and i've haven't run in to a single bug in full play through with main character. If the some gameplay footage of the game looks interesting to you may like it however don't expect something great because it not, it's decent and fun but if it goes without saying there are better games in the genre than smashing the battle.

It took a bit to get used to, and sometimes a little grinding because of bad decisions on the power ups I had bought… After ending the first campaign you get a different character. I enjoyed the second character more, which was refreshing, if not the game might have gotten old too fast.Give some thought on buying a different suit as soon as possible. Not all suits, just the one that fits your game style (one for each character of course). Also save the image gallery for last, only spend credits on it when there’s nothing else to buy. Most of it is online, since it’s fan art made some times ago (this game is a very well made port of a Korean mobile game, and the fans of it made the art of which some was selected to be in the port)."

,Recommended,467930,23255631,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,Raattis,"Come for the boobs, stay for the repetive yet oddly satisfying combat.The combat isn't about precisely chaining combos, like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, but mob control, like Dynasty Warriors. The game is very repetive in every way possible but on the plus side that gives plenty of opportunity to refine the tactics for every different mob type combination. And the two different characters play quite differently which is a nice change of pace.Combat feels satisfying. It's not the best I have played, but atleast you can interrupt the combos to dodge roll.The story and characters are surprisingly alright, which ain't saying much, but at the very least they aren't offensively stupid and cliche. Graphics are nice. Audio does the job.Some criticism and suggestions:Map design is unbelievably lazy: the maps consist of less than 10 different pieces that could easily be procedurally laid down to achieve endless number of varying (though still quite boring) maps, but instead same exact maps are repeated multiple times with identical item placement. Thank god atleast the mobs change from level to level which, to be honest, is much more important gameplay wise. Still, would have been nice to see atleast some variety in the level art. Maybe in a sequel?All of the bosses are just regular mobs scaled up and with small tweaks. This, I think, is fine, but one of those tweaks is an electric attack that is way too random: some times it bounces away harmlessly, but too often it piles on you after you have taken a hit or done a dodge roll and hits you multiple times often killing you. It can be avoided by knowing not to dodge roll or avoiding taking damage when you think it's coming, but it feels cheap and random. I would like to see it changed so that you can only get hit once per attack and preferrably so that there must always be at least a chance to dodge it.There are also numerous smaller enjoyment enhancing tweaks that could be implemented:1. Mercy frames: possibility dodge some small time _after_ getting hit to avoid damage (see Enter the Gungeon)2. Smaller hit boxes for characters or explosions, or larger warning rings for explosions, as now standing just out side of the danger zone markings isn't quite enough3. Danger zone markings always visible: now they sometimes blend into the chaos as enemies or red lighting can hide them.4. Better telegraphed attacks: in the midst of the chaos of combat the danger markers for especially lazers and the cutters are easy to miss, could the lazers have a ""small lazer"" that becomes visible before the attack starts dealing damage. I don't know how cutters could be better visualized, but now they often appear from out side of players field of vision making them very hard to dodge."

I can't find any other complaint about the game, besides price.edit: later impression:beat the first of two story modes, started with the second of two charactersmore of the same levels. Both characters have interesting abilities to try and make the most of, but the second character's moveset, if you can even call the amount of moves these characters can do a ""set"", is pretty uninspired.These two have got less moves than a level 1 dynasty warriors character and never get more.Granted, a lot of the game is about running around the square battlefields and kiting the crowds and dodging death, so it isn't fair to judge on the same criteria, since in this game evasive roll is the most important move.The boss fights get sort of like a danmaku - bombs get randomly tossed about, each showing a ring of what their explosion radius is going to be, and you have to dodge and weave between all the rings, running from the mob and trying to take a swing at the boss - using abilities like, drop a stationary magnet that pulls the mob toward it, at key times. As I noted before, this games controls are pretty smooth, refined feeling.So I think there's about 6-10 enemy types, maybe 5-10 levels that get recycled out to I think 60, plus the challenge modes, so even more. There are two characters that I think have about 4 moves that are unique to them, and two abilities that are unique to them.Unlocks/character progress would take a long time to complete, and I can't ever see myself doing it, since that'd mean repeating several more times an already repetitive experience.At 4 hours I can't be certain whether I'm done with this or not, ""done for now"", and like Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae, I'll come back to it every once in a while for its own unique thing.I do reccommend this, but MKH was about 1/10th the price and it was superior in many ways (other than oppai)."

Simple and gets a bit repetitive but still enjoyable to play, Looks nice and controls pretty well. It offers enough content to keep you going for a while if you want to clear all the challenge stages. Although I did start to feel that some of the later challenges were repeats of earlier ones with enemies having more HP.There were a few bugs initially on release (though I didnt encounter any myself) but the developer was very active with making improvements based on feedback. The game is in a good state now."
,Recommended,467930,23641309,"Posted: 18 June, 2016",all,happycasket,"Fun little brawler with scantily clad anime gals.  You have a second unlockable character, as well as unlockable outfits and upgrades for both characters.There isn't a ton of variety in the level design, but the combat is responsive and the enemy composition is mixed up enough to keep it fresh for 6-10 hours of gameplay for most people, assuming they're looking to unlock one or two outfits and score some upgrades along the way.  Some of the Challenge levels later on start to feel a little bullet hellish, so if you want to push yoru skills a little bit, you do have that option.Overall, it was a fun little weekend diversion for the price."
