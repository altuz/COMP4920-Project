Your home and the peace you enjoyed has been destroyed, and your family has disappeared. Can you survive the struggle, famine, and sickness to make it to the safety of Europe?""This is the description used for this game, and you might wonder why I bringing this up.Because the game doesn't in one single bit feels like things described there are in the game itself.Yes the game is set up in country despaired by war, and it's crimes ... but sadly you won't see it.Make no mistake, I wasn't looking for anotherThis War of Mine, where you could see the effects of war, feel emotional impact of every event, and your ability to survive was based on your actions.Home Behindhave nothing from this even slightly. What is even worse it is wrapped up in this happy looking visuals. Why? Sure, not everything have to be black ans white to show desperation, but why would you choose this color palete, why would you choose character design like this? I can't figure this out.Another mind boggling thing - music. What the actual ####!? After few minutes I was kinda on the ok note with visuals, and was able to look past them. Then I got into the combat, with refugee and the most unfitting music kicks in. Really? You are taking human life, and play some upbeat rock music!?  I wasn't even ok to listen to it in combats with wolfs, or bandits. It is just inappropriate (said by the guys who killed refugee in game, because of loot). And music overall isn't any better - it is too happy for game where you play for a character who lost everything.It doesn't make any lick of sense.But as I stated previously, you don't even realise this should be a war story from playing game, so technically my rumbling about misuse of theme shouldn't even matter.Combat in this game, is non existent. Click fest, where you have no idea if you hit or miss, or if you actually doing anything ... so option for auto combat is welcomed addition.Crafting/Survival element is quite alright. Nothing special or new. There are plenty of games, where I enjoyed this gameplay mechanics more. Also mechanics are in few cases easily exploitable. For example: You find dead body > You take meat of the body, which lowers your happiness by a significant margin > You bury the body after, your happiness is all back again. So no real consequences for being a cannibalAnd gameplay overall isn't really compelling - boring is maybe the right word. You just click, click, click, click ... and again I played couple games that I enjoyed this clicking more.I am really disappointed  and little bit angry atHome Behind. It looked really promising from trailer where I had different feeling, opposite to what I received during my playthrough.In my eyes, heart and mindHome Behindwould work better if it was packaged in adventure theme for instance, rather then war theme; and probably if this game was on mobile devices. Then I could see myself enjoying it more, or just be interested to play more, or even finished it. Under current circumstances I would opt for refund, and not even trying anymore get (at least) to first boss.Grade:D"

You just walk to the right and click on spots as you walk by like a hidden object game. This generates loot but there is no real feeling of scavenging like with other games like This War of Mine or even Skyhill. NPC interaction is nonexistant, the whole ""trade"" mechanism is where the NPC offers you a random object for another random object. I was halfway through my first play through before one of them actually offered to trade me something I owned.Combat is poorly done and although they say there is a rhythm to it it is highly erratic and quickly devolves into a click fest. Feedback is poor (why when I increase my INT does the INT challenge success rate not improve?)."

I am usually a pretty forgiving person when it comes to simple games ... and the unlocks in this game appealed to me quite a bit and won me over enough to give it a shot. This is the first game I have ever refunded on Steam. You walk ... and sometimes hit a button. There's so little gameplay or even interactions that make a whole lot of sense ... there's just not a lot here. Also, yeah, it's not been fully translated. And worse than that, it's been semi-translated in a way that doesn't even make sense. You can have a screen with two options on it and one of them is translated while the other is not.I feel bad writing this kind of a review, but honestly, save your money.

The design is pretty well great, kinda feels like playing DayZ and FTL at once.This game was originally written in chinese, but the english translation was actually well made. And Yes, this is actually one of the reason some of you never heard of this game (I only know about this game since yesterday)But I can't really recommend you this game for some reasonsFirst of all, the combat is horrible. Instead of a normal turn based, you are forced to mash your mouse within an interval, If you hit it too slow, the enemy will stun you. If you hit it too fast, you will miss your attackSecondly, you don't get to plan your move, Instead you're given a timer that keeps ticking even when you're just Idle. Means you might just bled to death just because you can't find your bandageAnd The worst of all is that there is no skill or learning curves required, you just have to rely on random number generation. Because there is this one resource called metal, which happen to be very essential because you are guranteed to die halfway into the first stage if you didn't get your hand on one of these, And I only got those metals once in my 5 playtrough.Long story short, This game comes with great storytelling, design, graphic. But the gameplay is just straight up terrible."

If the crate only gave wood or metal, instead of something from every loot-pool...-Using anything but the auto-fight feature (which can be found in the options/esc menu) is masochistic and degenerate and most of all, confusing.Overall I think if I could change the ending, and if it weren't so painfully grammatically bad.

Your interaction is limited to objects directly in front of you, so if an NPC wander just a pixel past you, you can't interact with them. I mean, you're stood right beside them, but talk to them? Nope.The combat is a bit of a click-fest with no real feedback indicating that you're clicking at the right moment to trigger combos, and the skill options are pretty unintuitive. The crafting interface is incredibly clunky.Bought it on sale, requested a refund less than an hour later........"

But the dialogue makes it comes off as very preachy and almost seems like some propaganda for a certain political view. So I tend to just skip all the talking; it's full of errors anyway. Incredibly cheesy.But as far as the game goes it is awesome when you don't feel the need for a deep story and lots of cutscenes. Its also easy to learn and does provide some challenge at the harder modes

76561198064895481,Not Recommended,467960,30227706,Posted: 27 February,all,nanc.hormann,"In ""home behind"" you play a father who lost his daughter while their home was attacked by the rebel armies. Promising himself he would find his daughter who has probably escaped together with his brother, the protagonist begins his journey. On the way he has to steal food, have an eye on his water reserves, fight enemies and therefore upgrade his weapon and armor.To start from the positive, the game has a good crafting system. It is not phenomenal and does not give the crafting subject really new perspective but its a well carried out, modern crafting system. Extremely rewarding and motivation giving part of the game as the deep desire to get the new kitchen or workbench upgrade keeps the player moving forward. The problem in this is that the crafting system is but the only part that gives the player motivation to continue in the game. And in addition to the crafting system it needs to be added that the skill tree and skill points system is ill fitted for the game.To continue with the graphics I think the decision to choose a 2d graphic is admirable as it is in general the right decision and the right graphic style for the general purpose. What total ruins the whole concept of this graphic are some contradictions in many assets of the game for example the ""story"" or the bad dialogues.The dialogues are to long, do not have any depth and give the game rather flat out characters. This is especially bad as this game and its main topic would be living from the dialogues and the emotional connection you would build with the characters. And the main formula is bad dialogues equals bad story. A concept that sadly also applies for this game.Furthermore the unnecessary boss fights and in general all the fighting is unfavorable for the game. As the fighting in my opinion makes the game more unrealistic which detaches the player even more from the fate of the real refugees. A critic which is also backed up by the fact that the fighting system is also mediocre in quality and game fun.All together these facts make the game feel like a comic version of (the wanted to be explained) refuge situation. The only time when I really appreciated the game and thought that they made a point, a real statement on the refuge situation is when you finally arrive in a ""civilized"" region and after some minutes as a player you think  ""o may god! This is even more difficult to survive in than the war region I fled from"".In general I have to give this game a rather bad review. A fact I am sad about because I really find it admirable from a game developer to try to tackle this difficult themes in a game. As I think games are (if made right and for the right costumer group) a good opportunity to make the players to think about certain subjects and maybe see them in another light.http://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/2017/02/home-behind.html"

I started to replay since it first came out with broken english subs and it seems they have added a little bit more. I really enjoy games like these, but the fact that there is more luck than there is planning or how you go about combat really turns me off. The past 6 times i've tried, I have died to going at least 30% of a stage without a single place for water 4 times. I understand a big part of this game is rough and trying to surivive with what you have, but there is no reason if it gives you nothing to at least make an effort to survive with. I can't recommend this game to anyone and I hope there is at least some effort into a system where you aren't ♥♥♥♥ed over by constantly being unlucky."

So you're a refugee navigating a harsh landscape to get to your brother and daughter, begging for food, fighting off wolves and raiders while music from a late 90's snowboarding game main menu plays. It's so out of place it's laughable. It completely takes me out of the game and there's no music slider so it's either all sound or no sound. I don't know how much time I'm going to be able to put into the game with this laughably bad design decision. Change the music or at least give me a music audio slider and at it's current price point I might recommend the game.Also the game heavily focuses on complete randomness. The trade system is so odd that 90% of the people you go to trade with will ask for something you can't even remotely have at that point. Need food or water? Hope you come across the right random encounter. Need anything at all? Pray to the RNG gods.Definitely not the worst game but it's certainly one full of questionable design decisions. The only thing I can applaud them on is not trying to price gouge us, they at least knew it was a five dollar game and kept it at that."

,Recommended,467960,26465881,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,HiddenImam,"Well, what can I say - the game follows the events happening in Syria now, you are a dad who's trying to find his kid by going from one side of the map to the other, fighting/chatting/robbing/breaking in/picking up everything and everyone you think worthwhile, killing a boss in the end to go the next map. That's the whole game in a nustshell.The game is fun at times and quite challenging - you can develop your attributes (mental, physical, agility, etc.) they will influence how likely you are to break into a house or to gather berries from a plant, you drag your trusty cart with you and it serves as your working bench, kitchen, in other words you use it to make new stuff from the resources you find.Every new game is random so it has a very high replayability value. I can say that I really like that game at first, but I stopped playing it at stage 2 - too much fighting which isn't really interesting (fortunately you can hand it over to the PC), but still I'd prefer a bit more intellectual challenge.  It also makes you favor the ""kill em all"" approach as there's no way to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t your way past the bosses.The story itself is very shallow and generic - at least from the what I've seen so far - but then again, I'm spoilt by what they call ""story-rich"" games where game developers actually try to make you care and believe in the characters whose lives you supposedly control.I'd give it a ""meh"", but it's worth it's salt and maybe I'm just being too hard on this one.

Although the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and text can be a bit wordy, it is satisfying to get to the end. There are some translation issues here and there, but nothing game breaking.

With enough metal, you get great gear, and then you beat the game. And how do you get access to metal? Luck. Luck is the only way to get metal pieces. It is a raw material, means it cannot be crafted, so the only way of getting it is by picking it up by luck. And that would not be the problem if metal is not so rare and so much needed, I actually just had enough metal to craft the 4th lvl workshop only after beating the final boss."

The story is progressed by long text dialogues that seem to drone on for the sake of adding whatever small amount of depth to the narrative they can. You'll find yourself skipping over them, unless you enjoy reading poorly constructed dialogue for 10 minutes at the end of every stage. The translations as well aren't finished, so there are still portions of the game that are in Chinese (?). Ultimately I found the narrative bland, the mechanics inconcistent (especially the fighting), and some things just don't make sense. Your survival depends partly on luck, but more so on how quickly you upgrade your cart, light source, kitchen wares, and work bench. However, as these are core elements of the game one would think that after putting in the time and work to upgrade them you would see a change in their visual representation in the game (like a torch upgraded to a lantern upgraded to an electrical light), but this is not the case. A fully upgraded torch or cart looks the same as when you first started out. The only changes you see are to the weapons you use, but even those are minimal. Visually the game is bland, the narrative is bland, and the mechanics are bland. If you pay close attention to the details as well, usually a mark of effort and dedication on the part of the developers, you'll be disappointed as well. Do not buy this game until the developers actually finish porting it to English, and put more work into creating a finished and well rounded piece. Quite disappointed in the game, as I play a lot of survival games, I thought this may be a nice twist to the classic survival format. Save your money and put it towards a better game."

The setting is a middle eastern desert, where you travel to find your brother and your daughter after a bandit raid seperates you. You must balance health, hunger, thirst, and mood. If your mood bottoms out your skills start to suffer. If your hunger or thirst bottoms out you start losing health. If your health drops to zero it is game over. Other things can damage your health such as enemies (wolves or bandits), bad food and water, and the enviroment such as cactus fields. Luck plays a role in your success but it doesn't govern it. Your decisions are what truely guide you on your path.Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)Graphics: 4 From the beautiful oasis, to the dusty homestead, and even the bloody remains of a family torn to bits by wolves. Every atmosphere is well drawn in clean colorful artwork. The opening scene is gorgeous even for just a series of pictures.Playability: 3.5 Simple controls but you can't change them up. the one way movement can get annoying if you accedently move past a searchable object since you can't go back.Fun: 4 Rolplaying your job to get the best out of your situation changes the decisions and skills you choose. Each time you may make different choices even with the same job.Sound: 3.5 Wonderful instrumental background music. The sound effect can use some work but they are far from horrible.Replay Value: 4 Random generation wins again. With 15 classes to choose from and a progressive unlocking system will keep you playing even after you find your daughter.Final Score: 3.75Final Thought: At $5.99 it will bring you hours of fun, but always watch for sales."

You play as a refugee that walks from left to right on the screen, and things pass by.  Once you have pass them, you can't ever go back, so you want to enure you are thorough. But the game has a built-in tension that rebels are heading your way, and if you wait too long they will catch up to you.  So you are constantly trying to things like build stuff, explore, talk to people, and fighting that takes times off the clock.  Meanwhile, the rebels are relentlessly movign behind you and taking everything over.  Now, like a Rogulilke, there is just one save, you have to continue from where you start, and teh RNG can be your friend or enemy. It's also a hard game on the normal mode of difficulty, and there is no (real) tutorial, you are just thrown in.  But it certainly is a good game, with things to unlock and and understand as you play through.  Sucessful playthrough should be 6-7 hours, assuming you don't die.  Unlike normal Roguelikes, you can restart from your pervious save when you bite it .  I enjoy the game and I think's well done and packaged for just 6 bucks, and the only things I would add to the the game are minor nitpicks (A few key dialogues happen in pull away scenes adn don;t take time off the clock, others happen on the screen and do.  The further yo go, the more stuff you have to craft to make crafting things, and I'd love some shortcuts so I don't have to make four ropes to turn into a heavy rope each time I need a heavy rope fo rsoemthign and I have the reources for the lesser ropes) .

He metioned the auto-battle system. Yeah, exactly, I used that auto-battle system after the first review and I passed the game several times. It seems that the auto-battle system is indispensable, everyone have to use it. Otherwise, high-frequency and long-time clickings are needed in every combat. As a result, I want to know, why developer designed the mannully battle system?Some other advices:Why we need to break doors even though people inside are friendly. The father cannot knock       the door?Supply packages are difficult to open. Some other inteligence demanding puzzles might be a better choice.Better characters or we say professions make this game much easier. In other words, at the early stage of this game, the players are simply wasting their time.------------------------------31/Jan/2017------------------------------Crude game, cannot find any causality between the place you searched and the item you got. A better background story like the one of Valiant Hearts is something this game really needed. And the most annoying system in this game I think is the battle system, totally cannot handle it."

Great plot with some deep thoughts.But it could really improves some balance in the gameplay, like, if you just finish a battle, no burglars in the next 8% journey. Or if there is a batlle 5 miles ahead, then you will not meet a wild wolf.Besides, it could use more tips on how to fight an enemy. It's nearly impossible to fight the boss in the 2nd chapter with my poor little baseball bat."

I mean you can be death with some minnion when you out of luck & can't hit them but if you have a lot of luck you can beat boss esily it's just my personal opinions .2. I plays this game one time & don't think to plays again so there is  16 jobs in the game but  i can chose only fourth's job that is badass3.The Final weapon crafting is very hard . you can finish the game before you can craft it -..-

However I cannot stop playing it.I started out determined to have integrity and not beg or steal, but after dying 20 times in the first half area I had to give in an do what it takes to survive. This really makes you think about what people go through when they flee their homes, and the lengths you'd be willing to go to for food and water.It's a game where you do a little better each time, hoping the random generation is kinder to you next time, but also preparing for the worst. 7 hours in and I'm 69% through my first journey, I'm already thinking about how my next playthrough will differ."

It seemed really interesting and I liked the look and feel of it, but it was just ubearably frustrating.First of all the background story text in the beginning goes so goddamn fast I stopped trying to read it after the first 2 sentences. I also noticed the random Chinese language bug on a couple of the text blurbs throughout the game - which I just passed off as a game quirk as you don't really know where the game is set - but reading others' reveiws it's obvious that this is just a bug.The most frustrating part for me was the fighting sequences. It's buggy as all hell in that your character is just flailing around and there's no telling if you're doing any damage or just seizing at the opponent. It also seems like the game randomly picks opponents and gives you incredibly difficult - frankly unbeatable opponents towards the beginning of the game when you haven't even had a chance to upgrade your weaponry or resources.I also love the colonies of 20 identical characters. Ugh.Needless to say this game has potential, but until they fix some functionality I will not be playing it again."
