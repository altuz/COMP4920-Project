Mine were FOGRE and God Factory. This game falls under very familiar circumstances. Here is the reality of this game from my perspective...CONS:Low population (Which deters players)Pay to Play (The antithesis of swift population growth)No recognizable IP (Uphill battle to gain mass appeal)Unpolished (Lots of bugs and presentation issues)Incomplete (Market? Co-Op Mission Modes?)PROS:Innovative Mechanics (Companies that try something new and take risks should be supported)Skill Based Combat (Simple to Learn Difficult to Master)Consistant Excitement (You will find yourself screaming, laughing, and looking forward to every match)Multi-Form Progression (Weapons, Armors, Crafting, Looting, Lvling, Learning/Customizing Skills, etc)My Ruling:So do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I purchased it for myself, *edit* 2 friends, and have been spreading the word to others. Will this game survive? I do not know the company well, the circumstances mimic many great failures before it, but I am willing to give them my $10 - $15 in support of innovation, for some great fun, and will be contributing bug reports in an effort to improve the experience for everyone. What I can tell you for sure is this... If you do not purchase this game, do not support innovation, and everyone else follows suit, not only will this game fail but the stagnation of creative new games will continue. Don't wait to join what is successful. Be part of creating success. I hope this review was helpful."

When I was first playing there was some really bad issues with tooltips, and the ui not being fully translated but luckily they hotfixed it within hours. The devs really follow the hub closely to. I posted a bug report and had a reply within minutes from a dev even though it was night over there in Korea.The combat is great though and entirely skill based. Armour doesn't really last long and falls apart after a couple hits so it doesn't matter much. Higher leveled weapons give you a slight edge but not to much. Default weaponry holds it's own against leveled weaponry very well. Each of the different weapon classes also has a huge affect on your playstyle. I've used the one handed sword style the most followed by duel wielding since it just matches my playstyle pretty well that I developed in Chivalry. A lot of people I've seen though opt for the board and sword or warhammer though.This game is going to get a great competitive scene going I think."

Only people who play this often is the ones from the very start who are level 30 (max).

Plus the netcode is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ dodging doesnt do anything since there is no I-Frames, plus you will rubberband back to your original position if youre stuck at anytime of getting away.Warhammer is seriously underwhelming where it only has a 2 hit combo for the damn skills while every other weapon has 3. Only viable skill is the Q but people with single sword can easily block it even during their attack phase from what I experienced.Greatsword is the only heavy weapon that can actually do something against people since it actually has 3 combo skills but even then half the time the keys dont even register and youre just left standing there with a thumb up your butt when you have full stamina.Every other weapon in the game can do an infinite combo or a bs combo where you hit 5 times and either take away half of the health or kill the person entirely.Also the game itself is super buggy and combat for heavy weapons is no where near smooth at all and feels very locked down like Monster Hunter while other weapons move in a fashion similar to Blad Symphony able to do whatever it ♥♥♥♥ing wants.Game is not fun getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by max level people using gear that does insane and bs damage.But hey if youre into getting utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥then go ahead you sick ♥♥♥♥."

While this game suffers from latency issues and some balancing issues the foundation is solid. Combat flows but is based on MMORPG stunlocky combat. This can either be a feature or a flaw depending on the person. Recommended because there are no other games like this and shows promise.

Daily to Weekly updates will make the game constantly better.The most people complaining about the game and the ""groggy"" state probably didnt notice it appears when you are at zero (1hp) and only exists for giving you the option to use your finishing-move. An gore execute that gives bonuspoints.The Mainproblem of the game is the Latency. As you sometimes simply cant do anything, because the whole combat is based on timing and reaction. Which makes counter etc totally unpredictable against a teleporting enemy.However this is one of the best Combatgames I've played so far. Some Maps and Modi like the Tournament provide some real nice atmosphere. For 9€ its totally worth it.General Informations about the Game:- You can customize your Character, even with only few options so far.- You can level from 1-30.- There are 7 different Combatstyles One-Handed Sword, Hwando(Katana), Dualwield Swords, Shield+Sword,   Greataxe, Greatsword and Greathammer- Each Combatstyle has similiar mechanics like Charge, Heavy Attack, Counter, Guardbreaker, Grab but with different moves and damage types. Also The moves within one Combatstyle are skillable and changable. You can choose between 3 different heavy attack moves for example.- Gear is provided after a game. The Quality improves as you can more points and a better rank. S Rank usually provides rare Blue gear, while an C or F is simply white, common stuff.- You are able to craft and upgrade Gear, while there are only level 30 blueprints out yet, you can upgrade every Gear as long as it has mod-slots. It improves your Max Heath or Stamina very slightly or increases resistance to one damage type.- While Mainly focuses on Multiplayer there are some Singleplayermaps which can provide some real challenge.8/10 ♥♥♥♥ this, I countered that!"

However, the game lacks quite a bit of polish. But this is to be expected with the game being in early access. Any population problems with the playerbase is because there just hasn't been a lot of buyers into this game. They have started an event to increase the playerbase though, which is a pretty bold move for these devs.This kind of PVP is a bit of a twitch-based action PVP game mostly focusing on only melee weapons. Sword, Greatsword, Dual wield, Hammer, Axe, and Hwando are available thus far. ...And as well as fist fighting as well.If this interests you and you're willing to support the devs. Go ahead and buy a copy.

Only problem is it lags most of the time which makes you watch your character attack with no result and then get creamed as it catches up with what actually happened. When it's not lagging there's game breaking bugs, like spawning in with no wepon or you have a weapon but no shield, or equipment just decides that it's both equiped and not at the same time ruining your characters defence.

Now theres only ever 4 types of people on.  1) People who have been playing this game for awhile and are friendly(ish). 2) People who have been playing this game for awhile and are human garbage. 3) People who have been playing this game for awhile, enjoy it A LOT, but know it's a sinking ship. 4) People who want to try to get into this game but the lack of players and amount of garbage players around make that decision waiver.An intresting game with a fun fighting mechanic and satfisfying action.  Getting it for less the $10 was a steal for myself, and I believe I have gotten my moneys worth.Cons- Bugs- Servers- Weapon Balancing- Solo Missions- Enemy A.I- Lack of Players- Groggy Mechanic- Skill upgradeI've played this game for quite some time with a variety of skilled people.  Playing some of the best with their perfered weapons and new players who don't know what they are doing.  Almost all if not everyone I have met, has always had a problem with bugs and the server.  Constantly getting stuck in walls, on the elevator of a certain map, falling down a pit slightly to be caught on the very edge of the walls, and falling out of the map to only meet your doom.  The server has been a big concern as this game heavily relies on a players ability to grasp timing.  If one player is lagging slightly it's very noticeable.  If one player is lagging like crazy it's very noticeable.  You can slash away at them and someone how they jump away from you without harm.  Or it can be vice-versa where you're that player who is lagging like crazy.  You'll perform a grapple or simply block on your screen effortlessly, meanwhile the other player is beating the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you as for them, you're simply standing there.Weapon balancing is a bit of an issue as many people complain that certain things are ""Broken"".  I've been bashed on and on about using a certain weapon as it is considered ""broken"" by the community.  Simply put:- shield has a stun unlike any other.  Capable of performing an infinite loop combo that annoys the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people as they can't break free from it.  As well as having the greatest block capability, which for obvious reasons it should since it's a shield, but many people complain that this is too op.- Greatsword has a standard mouse click attack that once the first hit lands, you seem to not be able to break free from it's grasp and just die to the combo.The solo missions are absolutely boring.  I only force myself to play it as no other players are on.  The first you play you enter a cutscene where your character runs out of a cooridor looking around and then you are able to use your character again.  I'm not too sure if it's because it's part of the story but I feel the cutscene was unnecessary.  You're told to hold off a horde of goblins that look a lot like giant wingless bats.  They look nothing like the typical so called goblin, but this is their game so they can make it look like whatever.  But, that leads me to the enemy a.i or lack there of.  It just felt like hacking away at moving targets that seem to hit you every now and then.  No challenge and no excitement.  The bosses are just higher hp and armored foes whose ai is just as terrible.  I'm not claiming to be a great player, but I know that I'm not a bad one and if I'm just hacking at moving targets disregarding my own hp it just feels like tedious clicking to finish the mission.This game is still quite fresh so it doesn't have a big player base, but at this rate it feels like it never will.  I'm not sure how I can help to promote this game as no one really cares about some random dude on the internet.  I've told friends and they said it doesn't look that great even though I think it has the potiential to be.  Hopefully it will catch on.There is a mechanic everyone seems to be in agreement of hating.  The groggy mechanic.  It's only purpose is allowing for enemies to perform a finisher move on you.  Sure the finishers look quite satisfying, one even has you grab the enemey by the neck and show them off as your prey before killing them.  But, that is all it is there for.  Which is annoying, if a player hp is low enough I think just being able to perform the finisher on them is good enough.  Get rid of the groggy mechanic, you're forced to mash the r button and stand there like a drunk idiot.  Just let us strive for our survival with a sliver of hp, not button mash r.You can improve your aresenal of attacks by leveling them up: requiring money, points, and reaching a certain level.  But, for some reason it doesn't show to be of any benefit at all for me.  I hover over it and it still says it does the same damage and require the same amount of stamina.  I haven't seen any improvements on my attacks using the same gear I used previous to leveling up my attacks.  And I can't test if they do, do more damage.Pros- Fighting mechanic- Graphics- Players- Progressive Player BuildingEven with all the cons I have listed, I still think this is a great game and has potential to grow to an even better game.  The fighting mechanic is fluid and fun.  Where timing and precision is a must.  A certain weapon has a more fine hitbox requiring you to think about if you should try that next attack or not.  Performing finishers is always fun as you it's a way to gloriously say hey I wanted to kill you and now I'm going to.  The fighting mechanic alone outweighs the cons for the most part as it's the reason why I play this game.  I wanted to play a game that was pvp with close quarter combat weapons.  This game filled that want.  The graphics are quite nice, showing great details in the maps, armor, and weapons.  The textures aren't anything to write home about, but you can tell that the developers do care for aesthetics.  The players I've come across are usually the top of the scoreboards.  They've played the game for awhile and know how to have fun.  A certain few have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s ,but mainly I've encountered friendly respectful players.  If you're stuck 1 v 2, they will take turns in fighting you. (for the most part)  The equipments are what will make the biggest difference.  Kind of like giving a novice a gun vs a master archer.  It's noticable in combat and just having one equipment could be all the difference you need in a close fight.I've thoroughly enjoyed this game, and will continue to do so.  I think everyone should give it a try as it is very fun.  Taunting at the big leagues and fighting them to a close deathmatch to only be stabed in the back of another enemy player is always annoying, but enjoyable at the same time.  The game itself is fun and the players are the factors that can improve that or make it less enjoyable.  I do recommend this game and think it's worth that $15 price tag."

,Recommended,467990,25344499,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,Paleknight,"Positives-Almost just what I wanted in a Gladiator game. It has customization for either having heavy defense for tanking or high endurance to move quickly, a decent variety of weapons (But could use more styles though and more weapons), allows you to customize your character and have more than one, and offers PVP as well as PVE. You got a crafting and upgrading system in the game to create better gear for fights too.Negatives-It has lagging issues which are somewhat minor, but annoying especially with dodging. Could use more customization for character making. Arenas need to be able to add more players or be able to allow more than the certain limit. Could use some more interesting features and assets like wild animals such as lions, tigers, and others. Lacking in PVE maps and could use more arenas in the near future for PVE. Plus if your gonna include skeletons and goblins maybe add other creatures as well?Overall it's a decent and pretty dandy gladiator based game, but is somewhat lacking devs might wanna add some more to this game. Might also wanna fix some bugs as well with the lagging."

,Recommended,467990,23955379,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Rinera,"EDIT: This ""review"" was regarding the game in Early Access. The game is still pretty much the same as it didn't remain in Early Access for long. While I still recommend the game as a game, the population is non-existent, I'm afraid... Then again, if I tell people to stay away it will never exist again at all.So, a hacky-slashy multiplayer arena PvP.. thing! And surprisingly promising. Keep in mind, Early Access, and I'd say it's an okay state for an Early Access game that recently launched. But one thing I have to say first is that the population is low. If you want to get into this, you will have to deal with playing against higher level people or people from different continents all together.Well, let's start with the important stuff; the combat. While not currently perfect, it's fast paced and tons of fun. Mind you it does need some getting used to and the solo PvE missions of the game don't really compliment it, but while against players it's extremely satisfying pulling off a killer combo and then finishing them off with a signature finisher (depending on the weapon used). As I said, not currently perfect, which is a VERY generous statement, but despite the bugs it's enjoyable.Second elephant in the room! Progression. Right now it does favour higher level players and is pretty much linear with better equipment the higher you go. However, the game is still highly based on personal skill and since a player's armour can break off, it could potentially put you on equal ground. Yes, a higher level player will still have better weapons, but at that point we would be talking about a single hit's worth of damage more or less.And with that, let's talk balance! The way the game works is to announce the team with the most points as winners, no matter whether they got the most kills or not. There is a certain tactic to it and killing the right people in certain ways can make you more points during a match. That way, even if a team is falling behind, a few smart plays and lucky kills and they can catch up. I think this structure is fairly well done overall. Now, regarding the weapons and armour, as I said there is also the armour breaking mechanic that can make somebody that just died actually have the advantage. Overpowered or glitchy weapons can be fixed but if the core game wasn't good enough, there would be nothing they could do but to start over. Thankfully, as I mentioned they implamented great ideas to give a helping hand to the loser while not punishing the winner.Graphically wise, it's.. meh. Artstyle is nothing special really, standard Korean stuff. It doesn't look bad but you won't find an amazingly looking game. There is an acceptable amount of details on the armour models, not so much on weapons though. I'd say it's passable overall.On the other hand, not being an amazing looker could allow them to make a better optimized game! Though right now it's not running great. There is a bit stuttering and weird frame-drops. Nothing too seriously, provided that you don't mind too much about that kind of stuff and hopefully will be improved later on. What you'd expect from a game that is around the early Closed Beta stages so to speak.The payment model is going to be B2P with microtransactions. Emphasis on ""going to be"". There are no microtransactions yet and they have stated they will not add them till they feel the game is in a good state. You know, basically what serious developers should be doing while going Early Access. So yeah, I believe they are in good hands.To conclude, I think they have something going on here. It needs work, but it could be a great game. The dev is highly active and cheerful in the forums so they seem to give a damn about it! I'd say give it a shot or keep an eye on it."

When I found out about this game I jumped on it without blinking. The short version can be read at the end of this review for a quick view. This review is based on my experience with the game regarding what is advertised and it is my opinion.The first minutes of the game is about creating your character (which is pretty simple since there is not a ton to customise, which frankly does not bother me at all for that sort of game). One thing stood out during the creation : I couldn't rotate my character to take a better look at my toon. The indication still was on the screen. I could zoom in or out, but not rotate. Meh, so what, took me one more minute to figure out which haircut to pick from the handful available, still no biggy. The preview of the different fighting style is clingy too, but it works.When the tutorial started, I was my character on a cell, with the quest indication (get out), but it took a long 3-4 minutes before I was able to interact with the game. I mean, it's the turorial, so who deeply care about this. It's fun when a team of developpers make it interesting and nice to play, but still, it is not a big deal.Once the turorial was over, I was redirected to the windowed main menu. There, I couldn't find my cursor. Some tabs where highlighted where, I guess, I passed over with my mouse. I reloaded the game and it was okay.At this point, I wasn't amazed by the clunkiness of the gameplay or the heavily buggy interface, but I wanted to play. I wanted to get the thrill of a gladiator (gaming version of anyway). So I went to start an online game : 0 player connected. Cool, the tutorial is done, I killed the people's champion in it, and there is no one else to fight. GAME OVER. Oh... wait, there is a Solo tab. I played one of the four (4) or five (5) solo scenarios and play it. Nothing amazing, really, but I played a gladiator nay, a warrior in a dungeon killing pink goblins and armored skeletons.Some of the highlighted loot was out of reach because I knocked back some of the ennemies in an unreachable hallway. This scenario took me a little short under 10 minutes.First match done, back to the windowed menau again. Back to the no cursor bug again. I quitted the game in a rush to check the detail of the early access to find out this is supposed to be a fully released game.If there is one conclusion I can make with this game is that it has big potential, from what I read inside the game and what I've seen. As of right now, the game feels clunky, is not polished and have so little a community that player might not be able to play games at all and if they do, will probably end up in unfair match either by playing agaisnt player with more experience and better gear or the opposite. With the heap of bugs roaming the game on top of all this, Versus: Battle of the Gladiator feels like a game in alpha stage that shouldn't be considered as a full released game right now in my opinion."
