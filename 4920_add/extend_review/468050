It's an interesting mystery, with creative misdirection. It's rare that I'm very wrong in my guess at what I'll find at the end of a game, and I was wrong in this one. Happily so!The writing is great, and the humor is subtle, understated and excellent."

Reminds me of the old point and click adventures I used to love so much.I think the store page overstates how 'non-linear' the story is, but overall it is still quite worth its price and I'd even buy a sequel. Keep up the good work, game dev."

The story was great, and the writing was excellent -- a call-back to monkey island's dry wit. It lacks a bit in the audio, and the level-design was one-note. That said, it was a treat to play! I'm very interested to see more from this studio in the future, this game shows lots of promise. Overall, I would say a solid 8/10. Certainly worth it for the price! Can't go wrong."

Reminds me of the best Telltale adventures and Wadjet Eye games like The Shivah. Also one of the first times I actually bought a game soundtrack. If you like adventure games, it's the best two gaming hours you are gonna have this week, especially at this price."

I'm really looking foward too the next few though, it took about an hour and a half.  Story has a lot of interesting moments i really liked and i laughed a good amount of times.  Very cheap which definitly makes it worth the price and im happy to be one of the first to purchase this game."
76561197968321754,Recommended,468050,32996836,Posted: 29 June,all,Speedkillsuk,"A lovely interactive short story with minimal puzzles and multiple choice-based endings.I was genuinely surprised by how much I liked this game, as the presentation seems quite amateurish (mostly because of the quality of the art), but at the end of my 1.5 hours I felt like I'd definitely got my money's worth (and then some). The puzzles are simple, but decent enough to make you feel engaged. The art is minimalistic (but functional), and works well enough in this short story context. The game is short, but the story quality is high, and there are multiple endings based on choices you make throughout the game.The length may put some people off, but I've spent a hell of a lot more on movies that I've enjoyed a hell of a lot less. If you have a couple of hours to spare and fancy a simple game with an interesting story, I'd highly recommend this."

Sure there are a couple major differences, but I wouldn't go as far as to say it was completely up to the player what happenes. It still has an interesting narrative and deifinetly worth a look."
,Recommended,468050,25434072,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,Crzy,"After looking through some new games, This one was the only one that actually looked good and intriguing...I thought it was just gonna be a detective game between 2 cops who just solve crime together.The choices in this game roughly end the same way but in a different style..I absoulutly loved the humor and story showed throughout, The characters werent likable but proved to be an important part, as this game teaches you that you might make mistakes and blame yourself...But as you go 40 years later as an old man still regretting that, you realise it wasnt yourself to blame...I LOVE THE SOUNDRACK. This game feels more like an interactive movie which I love about it..the only thing I hate was the fact that this game is 2-3 hours long.I definitely recommend it to those who are about adventure and investigating point and click sorta games.8/10 would get Darren killed again"

It's got a great soundtrack that evokes emotion but is still catchy to listen to just because.3. The story grips you with tension. Moments happen where everything depends on what you say or do, and up until the last second when the conclusion is decided you feel that consequence, and even the regret that comes after. It deals with the hole in a person's heart after a great loss, and how you can overcome it, or how it can twist you to the point where you are somebody unrecognizable from who you were.4. Yes, it is short, about 2.5 hours, but have I mentioned it's 4 dollars?5. WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS YET!!!6. DO YOU JUST HATE GOOD THINGS?7. Now you're just making me mad.....8.

,Recommended,468050,32048724,Posted: 29 May,all,Holy Lord of the Soviet Empire,"Interesting adventure game with non-linear storytelling. The game is shorter than I would have liked, but for four dollars, it is definitely worth it. The couple hours of gameplay had a variety of experiences with suprising twists. The game was not focused on a traditional good-guy bad-guy narrative, but used realistic personalities with their own faults and good qualities."
76561198120480014,Recommended,468050,33528033,Posted: 13 July,all,simply goose,"A short game, certainly. Took me just 85 minutes. Not even a hour and a half. The Last Time was not so much a game as it was an experience. The experiences of a man haunted by his past. It tells a tale of mistakes, grief, regret, and, in a way, redeption. The story inustrates the damage that is caused when a person can't let go. Whether they can't forgive themself or others. For as inexpensive as this is, I believe it to be rather insightful and worthwhile. You're paying for less than it costs to see a movie for a more involved experience. I found this ""game"" to be very much worth my time."

I was looking for a good game to play friday night, and I couldn't have picked a better one than this. The story was amazing, captivating, and solid throughout. The pixel art gave it a relaxing feel, while also leaving room for imagination to figure things out. And the soundtrack was just spectacular and relaxing, it really fit well with the mood. If you have a few bucks to spend, I 100% reccomend you play this game. Sit down with some food, a soda, and 2 hours of free time for one of the best indie games you've played in a loooong time."

76561198061401443,Recommended,468050,25496747,"Posted: 13 September, 2016",all,Triple Seven,"Enjoyed this game very much. Fairly short and sweet, but the mood, characters, soundtrack, and humor made it well worth the purchase. The puzzles are fairly light (I would hesitate to call them puzzles so much as objectives), so in that regard it's closer to Telltale than, say, the Sierra or early LucasArts games with whom it shares some visual similarity. A minor critique would be that the amount of significant variation in the game based on your choices does not seem to be nearly as much as the quoted reviews would suggest. That said, if you're a fan of 90s style point-and-click or adventure games in general, I'd absolutely check this out."

I don't think it was worth $4 so I'd recommend buying it on sale. I liked the art, storyline and music, as the background noises went well what was happening in a scene. I experienced a range of emotions, I laughed, got nervous and even teared up a couple times. There were a few jumpscares that didn't get me but only because I'm used to them after years of playin video games.Anyway, I really liked it and I recommend everyone to play it."

76561198060385399,Recommended,468050,30102118,Posted: 22 February,all,Zamora,I was hestitant to buy this game at first because of the simplistic art style. On twitter Olivia White (Owl Caves dev) recommended the game so I decided I'd try it. It's actually a really well done game. There is a lot of choice that seriously affects the story. You often have a choice to be mean and forceful or kind and helpful. The only bad thing I can say about this game is the length. I have 2.8 hours of gameplay right now and a bit of that was spent with the game paused. I wish this game was longer because I really enjoyed it. I guess it's short length is offset by how many times you are able to replay the game and get different outcomes. If you like P&C games where graphics don't matter then check this out. It's good.

You can see how the game looks like right away - it's a decent point and click experience. It's the writing that is the game's strongest advantage. The story and the main character feel very relatable because it's player's choices that decide upon the character building and how the story unfolds. And that's why the game is good - it feels personal even though it has so little time to build a personal connection between itself and the player. That's a strong recommendation from me."
