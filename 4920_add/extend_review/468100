Freeride (like in Waverace :-)- Very intense gameplay with good weather effects- Graphics is from clean/functional (what i like) to really beautiful- I counted 40 courses in 9 different enviroments!- Couldn't see any bugs (Early Access, but nearly finished i think)Cons:- No replays (that would make the game perfect to me)- No course with snow/iceThank you Zordix-Devs for making this great game. I love to play it."
,Recommended,468100,32687641,Posted: 23 June,all,Blunder Sunder,"I almost didn't leave a review for Aqua Moto because ultimately I refunded the game due to being dissapointed with it, but I would like to recommend it with certain caveats, as even though I wasn't toally happy it may be what you're after.If you're looking for a modern WaveRace, then this is the closest thing I have found, by a long shot - don't consider the other options. The controls are tight and arcadey - the water has movement and variation, there are actual waves to contend with. The graphics look decent, nothing impressive but they're certainly 'good enough'. There are several courses to race, all different.Ultimately though it all feels very low-budget. The audio design, the interface, even some of the models and visuals all feel very early-access - and I don't get the sense that the game will see any active development, which is a shame as it could really do with it. This is what ultimately led me to a refund - it's a game that feels like it has a lot of potential, but just falls a bit flat.As long as you're able to see past the above, and get the game in a good sale, then there's a good chance you'll enjoy it."
,Not Recommended,468100,25716822,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,Doyefeellucky,"If your looking for a water racer like Riptide but much better, then this is it. Decent enough arcade game for £15.Personally, I was hoping for an enhanced version of Wave Race 64 or Blue Storm(probably because plenty were saying it was a Wave Race successor). What I got is a kind of  game you'd find in your local arcade with a full size Jet-Ski attached. Great for a few minutes fun with your mates.It just doesn't feel like your interacting with the water in general, and in particular the waves. There are waves(big waves at the 'Shipyard' course) but you can't utilise the wave, like getting air or dipping in to it to keep control- you just cant pitch your craft in the water or air. I can see waves, but it plays flat!Over a few days I ran 3 championships several times in Aqua, then 1 in Wave Race 64 on an emulator, then twice on Blue Storm on my old GameCube, then played Aqua again. Even Wave Race 64 seems light years ahead when it comes to riding the waves and overall interaction with the water.Why didn't the developers reverse engineer the Wave Race games(the 'classics' as the developer calls them) if that's what they were going for?Of course, I can't blame the developers that they chose not to make a next-gen Wave Race. I suppose they've got to produce what they think will make them money."
76561198157739512,Recommended,468100,29930998,Posted: 14 February,all,Aqua_Puma,"Important note for review: There are two types of personal water crafts (PWCs) in this game. Runabouts (the large sit-down type) and Skis (the nimble stand-up type).A review after 4 hours:Let's get the negatives out of the way first, because you're probably worried about them and decided to look at some reviews first. I was aware before buying this game that it had a reputation for aggressive AI, or in other words: opponents that like to ram you. Well that's not quite the case. The real cause of that is the vehicle ""mass,"" or ""weight."" Both you and your opponents are very easy to knock around. In the Ski division this isn't really a problem, but it heavily affects the Runabout division. Why? Size. You just make contact far more often, and frustratingly it really does affect your racing lines, which is already tough to keep tidy because you're driving on water. Also, in theory, the runabouts have longer tail sections (sticking out past the axis on which the watercraft model pivots) making them easier to spin out.Now, I was sure to play at least two thirds of the tournaments to get good data, and while these things do occur, they don't happen near enough to deem it ""game-breaking."" But they sure are noticable, so you can never quite feel safe knowing your lap can be ruined in an instant.Player Solutions: Never intentionally make contact, and if you're hung up on an opponent just get off the throttle. Usually their racing line is messed up too, so the sooner you get off of them the sooner you can pass them.Developer Tweaks(?): Maybe try increasing the ""weight"" of the runabouts so they don't react so drastically with collisions with opponents. Also, if it doesn't make aerial spins look weird, maybe trying moving the turning axis a bit to the rear so it's less easy to be spun-out by opponents.And now for the Positives!-This is easily the best looking PWC racing game I have ever played.-Fun, especailly in the ski division.-Sense of humor.-Surprising amount of customization, including 1 or more areas for color changing on the PWCs AND a satisfying character creation including height, build, gender, multiple faces, eye color, clothing & gear, hair, and even some basic tattoos.-Don't like the announcer? You can pick a different one! Don't like either of them? You can turn them both off!!-Satisfying controls and trick system.-Challenging tracks! The other racers won't be the only thing challenging you as you progress, and there are many variations of the tracks and 3 weather presets. I'm 2/3 of the way done with both divisions and I feel like I haven't raced the same course twice!-Pop culture reference from the year 2000. I won't ruin it for you, but it made me smile and I had to mention it somehow.-Decent music. It's not licensed music like back in the days of Splashdown for PS2 but it's enjoyable and not too weird or generic.-Compatible with an Xbox One controller but will also automatically detect an Xbox 360 wired controller. No setup required, from my experience.-Free roam mode allows you chill out and check out each unique area that each of the multiple races are routed through.Conclusion: If you're a fan of watersports games new and old from Splashdown to Wave Race to Riptide GP2, then Aqua Moto Racing Utopia is totally worth the buy. At 30 dollars, this game looks great, has plenty of features for a modern entry to the genre, and presents a good challenge. I'm happy with the purchase, and I hope the developers continue to support this game and maybe make an outstanding sequel in the future! One can only hope. Devs, thanks for keeping the genre alive and here's hoping you get even more funding for the future."

76561198097632017,Recommended,468100,29484748,Posted: 25 January,all,Suntrooper,"I got this game in Winter Sale and hoped that it was like the good old Nintendo Wave Race.I played it for like half an hour and was pretty disappointed: The setting and the races were just like Wave Race, but the handling wasn't at all, it was not that hard to control like Wave Race (except maybe for the big wave map ""oil rig"").Another day I gave it another shot with 3 friends and i have to say that after I spent some time with it, I really enjoyed it and played the solo races afterwards as well.The setting and the graphics are gorgeous, the maps are diverse, you just have to feel good at these locations. Combined with the first person view it get's pretty immersive and you feel the flow (although you see less and it gets harder that way, of course).The gameplay itself is less based on just controlling the vehicle (like Wave Race as i mentioned before) but on fluidly and tightly getting around the markers, which feels like drifting with a car. If you get used to it (which happens quickly) it's remarkably enjoyable.In contrast to some other early access titles i played, this game has no (apparent) bugs and you can see that the developers put love into it. There are the small things like the ego view, the multiplayer minigames and of course the local multiplayer feature itself which will keep me coming back.The downside is, that for nowadays, it's not a lot of content. I think that the game is actually somewhat overprized, but if you get it in sale, it's alright....And I wouldve liked an polar type map, even if it's not realistic, but no blame for that."

76561198367661652,Recommended,468100,30364616,Posted: 6 March,all,shrubberylord,"This game is simply amazing and quite similar to the old wave race series of games, but with more of everything. Solid gameplay mechanics with the simple concept of driving a jetski or a runabout model watercraft at sea and in canal races. It might be challenging at first, but a lot of fun and very addictive once you get the hang of it. All it brings makes it really stand out in the racing genre as special.Aqua Moto Racing Utopia gives you the option of playing two full blown career modes, a whole single player league full of championships for jetskis and one whole separate league for runabout models. On top of that - a freestyle league where pulling off the coolest stunts on time is all the fashion.There's tons of different maps and tracks that will immediately test your split-second reaction time as well as your tactical skills. While none of the diverse ""exotic"" worlds where the action takes place use their real name it’s obvious which they are. The quality of the sound effects, original music and the voice actors really help make it more entertaining.My best tips:* First make sure you got a great controller, like an Xbox, Steam controller, or similar.* After discovering the quick turn button and all the clever rotation stunt tricks I could do in the air I had a blast!* Use the right stick while you're driving to do stunts in the water. It will load your boost.* Chose wisely among the jetskis to find the right one for each track.* In the duckling mama party game you slow down if you have too many ducklings. Stay cool and steal the other's ducklings just before every 20 second pass when score is added. Then lose your ducklings and steal them back again before the next 20 sec pass.* Try out the first person camera for a truly great sensation of speed, especially in canals.To sum it up, it's like the classic wave race and stunt games combined, into the most addictive racing I've experienced in quite some time."

I love arcade racers be it in water, mud or outer space.It's extremely expensive but if you look for competitive water racing it's the best option you have. The content is of high quality and there are lots of championships and other game modes. The realism, in particular the jetskis and how the character leans from side to side, is quite spot on.If you're serious about arcade racing and enjoy the challenges water brings, and you don't mind spending a buck or two, then I can recommend Aqua Moto Racing Utopia."
76561198367042983,Recommended,468100,30308375,Posted: 3 March,all,jeromeeC64,"Hi everyone,It's surprisingly enjoyable in Aqua Moto Racing Utopia to figure out how to tackle the waves with the control stick. And use the other stick to perform stunts, both in the water while driving and in the air. It's great to see some up to date 2017 water graphics, a variety of high end jetskis lined up to chose from and beautiful real world settings. Each setting has custom music playing, which is pretty cool, instead of just one track over n' over.And the best of all is you don't have to be a pro-gamer to have fun with it. You can always try to beat your own records instead of going for the #1 spot. The next championship is unlocked if you are among the top three in the total standings.We played it with some friends, a couple from Australia and I can with deepest warmth recommend the party games.No thumbs up for Aussie beer though."

As a long-time fan of the Wave Race series, I recently picked up Aqua Moto Racing Utopia after reading numerous reviews commending how advanced and detailed the water physics are.After just an hour with the arcady simracer I can honestly say that I consider it my go-to racing title. The controls are phenomenal. The soundtrack and settings truly are top notch. Finding new racing lines feels great. The different weather settings are awesome, from rain to sunset. The venues are convincing and well implemented as is the hard boiled AI making little ""mistakes"" here and there, feels very alive. It can definitely give you a run for your money!The engine sounds, doppler effects when you get passed, water noises, etc etc all are very well done overall! I also really appreciate the attention given to the jetski movement in how it responds to the aerodynamics in the air and the forces of the sea, very cool!. Being able to race online with my friends is also a welcome feature. If you want to experience some of the best water physics that racing has to offer I strongly recommend this game."

The control feels lovely to me, i was weaving around those bouys and getting 'Great' scores on my first race!.If i'm being honest, i did feel the price was a little high for a new Early Access game, but the game already is crammed full of content (something like 12 tracks/worlds each with multiple tracks).If you are a fan of Wave Race, or just old arcade style racers in general, give the game a shot, you WILL like it."

You race hard against competitive computer-controlled riders and you perform stuns that would break your neck in real life to charge your turbo. The cool part is that waves are formed from the watercraft and you see and feel them which shows the programmers care about details. And there are a bunch of increasingly hard riders to beat. It's still a new game, thus the high price. I was fortunate to get it during a Steam sale a couple of weeks ago. If you like arcade water racing you should get your booty wet too."

,Not Recommended,468100,33942293,Posted: 31 July,all,akumajobelmont,"Kills me to say it, but Aqua Moto Racing Utopia isn't really worth your money.It can look stunning at times, but that illusion is shattered by the way your character animates. There's nothing in the actual feel of the racing here to suggest that the rider (or the jet) is actually racing on water, despite everything else on the screen telling you otherwise. Everything is extremely rigid, and has no flow. There's no depth here, despite some valiant attempts at it. The trick system, too, is fundamentally flawed. Not only do the moves lack pizzazz, they're just not satisfying to use at all.I have a massive, massive soft spot for b-grade arcade racers. Loved them through the 8/16bit generations, and that love was cemented in the Saturn/PSX/64 days. You don't need a massive budget to create a racer that feels right. The surface similarities to Wave Race 64 and Blue Storm do more harm to Utopia than good, as the game really can't match the sublime controls of either title.I was really, really hoping that Utopia would deliver the goods, but I can't in good conscience recommend the game. Riptide GP 2/Renegade are, right now, the far better option if you have a water racing scratch to itch. And in saying that, I honestly hope the developers go back to the drawing board and re-think their approach to the controls, animation and overall feel. The game has the content, and it's got the glitz, but without the core gameplay, it'll always just be a pale imitation of what's gone before.I hate writing negative anything, but it's my sincerest wish to see this game evolve and be the game that the devs, and we want it to be."
76561198015850074,Not Recommended,468100,33134577,Posted: 2 July,all,Ca55,"This looks, plays, and sounds exactly like an arcade game from the late 90s. The soundtrack is super cheesy, consisting mainly of really low budget electronic techno-style music (the sort of thing you heard blaring across every arcade centre back then), but whilst I could live with that, the reason I soon refunded this was due to an unforgivably bad UI mixed with one of the worst control schemes I've ever encountered (right up there with Lego Worlds!). It sucked the fun right out of it for me and so I don't recommend this game.The problem starts with the menu screen UI, which has Xbox controller button prompts hardcoded into it - this is true regardless of whether or not you are actually using an xbox controller, so you're left guessing which keyboard keys are required to access the various parts of the menu.Once you figure out your way past that and into the tutorial, you're expected to learn the basic ramp jump tricks you need to know in order to progress. No problem - assuming you have an xbox type controller. This is because every on- screen prompt for every trick is hard-coded with 'controller' controls, regardless of what actual control scheme you've set up in the Controls menu. So learning the tricks becomes a guessing game of trying to understand which keyboard control you've set, corresponds with the on-screen controller controls diagrams. It's infuriating, frustrating, and not at all fun.Even if you have the patience to reconfigure all of the controls and memorize it all, I still believe that the overall control scheme is really bad. For example, one would assume that W = Forward, S = Back, etc, correct? Not this game. WASD refers to rotations in different directions. No problem then, I hear you say - the Arrow keys must then be the standard Forward, Back, Left, Right controls, no? Nope again. In this game, the arrow keys perform stunt/trick modifiers. In order to accelerate, you must use Space bar. Space bar!!! It makes no sense! I've never played a racing game with Accelerate defaulted to Space Bar! So again, you could of course reconfigure all of this and then try to memorize what you've done in relation to what the standard layout would do, but who has the time and patience for that? I just want to race my jetski! Even the Tony Hawk games understood that there needed to be a standard, familiar set of controls for basic movement so that even a beginner could interact with the game in a meaningful way. This game throws all of that right out of the window.After limping my way through the tutorial, I tried a practice event and hated every moment of it. The issue with the bad control scheme was just too much and I immediately refunded it.So beware: Even if you have a controller and you're prepared for the madness of the trick button schemes, ensure that you are prepared to deal with late 90s-style graphics and sound effects."

With games like Riptide 2 and Riptide GP: Renegade being such fun and arcade like, this one just feels sluggish to me. Its definitely more realistic than both Riptides, and considering the prices of both Riptides and HydroThunder  in the windows store, this one is a tough sell unless 80% off.

If this was resolved the game would be really good. Wave physics on the jetski isn't at Wave race levels but Nintendo have much bigger budgets to spend on such things.Fix the opponents problem and I'd recommend this all day.this has now been improved but crocodile swamp is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with opponents ramming tou into objects that spin you 180 whilst they are unaffected
,Recommended,468100,33438688,Posted: 10 July,all,Ronguul Thatch,"Fun jet ski racing game that rekindles memories of Wave Race on the Nintendo 64. Game looks great and controls well. Some of the races however can be difficult to navigate as the buoys are too close causing any kind of directional ques to be wasted and unfortunately getting you lost. Buoys should be marked better on harder to navigate races with maybe just the current one lit instead of more than one. It can be a little disorienting in the heat of a race. Overall though these are minor complaints. As you get to learn the tracks the buoy markers won't matter as much.Aqua Moto Racing Utopia is good for quick bursts of fun. Although AMRU is more technically polished and it's core gameplay houses a little more depth, I'm still drawn more to the arcadey in and out stylings of the Riptide GP series. Riptide just feels like the kind of game I would be standing (or sitting) in an old school arcade dumping tokens into.I'm recommending Aqua Moto Racing Utopia because it IS a solid entry into the genre, it looks pretty, and there are a lot of options and tracks to keep you coming back."

Aside from some minor changes and some cosmetic updates, this is literally Wave Race, and considering Nintendo doesn't make Wave Race games anymore, yes this is very welcome indeed.+It's Wave Race. Classic 'ride between buoys in pretty locations' gameplay. Yes, it's still fun.+On top of the 'Ski' division, this game has a 'Runabout' division where you race larger jetskis around. They don't bounce as much and it's hard to perform tricks with them, but they are a welcome (and fast) change of pace.+Ten different locations, with multiple tracks at each venue, only a few of which get reused in the career mode.+The easter eggs in this game are pretty fun to go after.Remember when games had hiddenWilson volleyballsand big head mode? Me neither...well okay, on second thought I remember big head mode from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, but my point previously did stand on the volleyballs until I remembered that Killing Floor 2 has a map called ZED Landing where you can shoot knockoff Wilson volleyballs for an achievement. So, that's not necessarily too original either, but my actual point is not too many games do easter eggs like that period, but moving on...-The 'Freestyle' division can be a fun alternative to the racing, but sometimes the trick controls glitch out which can lead to some frustrating situations.-The water underneath your ski does feel a little flat at times. (To counter this, use the Left Trigger in conjunction with the Analog Stick to launch yourself airborne into a trick, maybe a flip even.)Recommendation:It's Wave Race. If you like Wave Race, get this. You'll probably love it."
