76561198036640366,Recommended,468160,25514567,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,ct5holy,"Early Access Day 1 review:Edit: Thumbs up because it looks promising. (I'd hold off getting it until counting method issues are resolved, hopefully.)Project seems promising. It includes basic tutorials for rules and scoring, a VS. AI mode and an Online multiplayer mode.The AI is not particularly strong on any setting (Hard is when it starts playing slightly better moves, maximum tends to take a bit more time to play moves, but not a LOT of time.) So (at least at this stage) the AI is really meant for beginners. It would be nice to get a stronger one later down the line, but I'd rather see good multiplayer added than the focus be on AI.The UI is polished and pretty. It seems simplistic, but in the same way that Go is ""simple"", giving it a nice ""relaxed"", almost elegant look.A few notes:At the current stage, it does NOT appear as though you can do the following:*You cannot Select custom Komi values (7.5 is way too much on small boards! I usually play with 6.5 komi on 19x19 anyway...)*You cannot Choose to play Black or White (It always made me black? Maybe the Host is always black?)*You cannot Choose different scoring methods (Japanese and Chinese (area counting) being the most important of these. Are points in mutual life counted as points? I haven't encountered this yet so I'm not sure...)*You cannot Choose different timing options for the game (e.g., Canadian Byo-yomi or Japanese Byo-yomi)All of these will be vital things to add, in my opinion, to make the title complete and robust. The lack of scoring methods really stuck out to me, as requiring people to capture ""dead"" stones in their territory may teach them the value of filling in dame, or ""neutral"" points first, but not all scoring methods will allow you to play stones within your territory without penalty.As a side note, I am not a fan of including ""two eyes"" in the tutorial. I believe needing ""two eyes"" is an emergent property of groups, which are not made until they are needed, so they should not be taught as required... Teaching the concept of ""two eyes"" being required for life has often made beginners I'm teaching/facing over-concentrate, allowing me to gain the upper hand everywhere else on the board. This is a bad habit I have to try to knock out of them. ""Two eyes"" isn't a rule, it's just something you learn a group needs space to 'eventually' make in order to live 'if' required.I look forward to seeing what this project becomes in the future! I am very excited to be able to share and play Go with friends on steam!"
,Not Recommended,468160,32171001,Posted: 4 June,all,Vino [Olive Garden],"Go and Ancient GoAncient Go is a barebones Go client for Steam. If you don't know about Go, it's an abstract strategy board game that is thousands of years old yet still popular today. It is unique in many respects; you can learn more and try it out free atOnline Go. The rest of this review will focus specifically on this software, not the game itself, which is excellent.Ancient Go features a 3D model of a Go game, a rudimentary AI, and can function as a basic client for the Online Go Server. OGS is a large and established community of Go players so you should be able to find a game at any skill level any time of day. I was not able to get that feature to work (it kept saying my username and password were wrong, though I was able to log in on my browser just fine) but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and assume this is just a temporary bug.This software has the features any Go client worth installing *must* have, but it lacks the features such a client *should* have. In order of importance, these include:A tutorial for concepts beyond surrounding territory on capturingGo is a game of endless depth, and I was sad to see that the tutorial doesn't even touch on it. There is no advice after you get through the ""how to play"" content; you can only play against an AI in freeplay matches and try to work it out yourself.PuzzlesPuzzles are a huge step for beginning players as they learn on small-scale the common tactical tricks and pitfalls that pop up dozens of times every game. Without a solid knowledge of these basic interactions, newbies are guaranteed to lose game after game for simple mistakes. This is frustrating and unsatisfying. Go clients must have puzzles!Campaign ModeCombining the two above features into a campaign that lets the player feel like they're progressing would turn this into an actual product worth paying for. I'm not asking for a fully voice-acted epic story, just something that brings a player to novice level skill in a way more compelling than grinding joyless, identical AI games.A more feature-rich OGS clientCurrently this client lacks chat and many other standard features. The developer says this is intentional and will likely not change. This means there is little difference from playing against an AI, except it takes longer to get replies on your moves. Having players to chat with and ask questions is critical to new Go players; only the most masochistic can lose the requisite 100 games without any feedback other than ""You lose, good luck figuring out why that happened"".Cosmetic customization of the board, stones, lighting, backgroundRight now you can only look at a plain wood board with classic shell/slate stones on an ugly black void background. There's no customization options of any sort, and the existing aesthetic is so traditional that it adds little to the game experience compared to a simple 2D image. I was really shocked how bad this is, considering the graphics are literally the only advantage this has over more traditional methods -- and it's not even as good asTabletop Simulator, a much more popular, versatile, and extendable piece of software.Final ThoughtsI'm not sure who the target audience for Ancient Go is. People who take the game seriously are used to the rich, efficient, and *free* clients that already exist and will likely not drop their features and cash just to get a render of a board and an additional potential point of failure in online matches. People who are new/casual Go players are going to need more help than ""here's how to place stones, here's what 'ko' means, good luck!"".Even when one tempers expectations (a $5 price point, a dev team of one) Ancient Go is a letdown. I hope the developer continues to work on it and I can update my review to a more positive rating. As of now, it's just too bare; visitOnline Gofor everything this game can do and 10x more, for free and without installing anything. Then, if you love the game and want to spend money to play in a cool 3D environment and let your steam friends know you're doing so, buy Tabletop Simulator instead."

,Not Recommended,468160,32076019,Posted: 30 May,all,Action Hank,"If you're looking for an offline AI to just take around, sure, it's an ok small purchase. If you're looking to play online, I think I may just suggest using online-go dot com instead of this, since this only acts as a client for the already free website.A few nit picks with it: the options menu is woefully lacking. Resolution would be great, and it's not quite clear whether 'in' or 'out' is on or off with the options (out is 'off' since I got an achievement for turning off hints)And speaking of hints: I don't think it's quite fair to have a client for another website provide hints, even optional, when the website doesn't provide them. I'm a noob, no bones about it, and I've overlooked an easy atari more times than I can count. This program points them out for you, optionally. That just doesn't sit right with me for online play, but I wouldn't complain if it were regulated to AI matches.And a last big complaint: there is no chat functionality in the program. If you want to talk to anyone on the website you've got to log in with your phone or other device."

I also was not reimbursed for capturing stones that were dead in my territories but had to be captured for the games counting system( I was looking and was at 76 then after the capture I was at 75?). I enjoy Go and want this game to succeed on Steam but i just dont like the counting system as it is.I don't have any complaints about the aesthetic or the AI speed. It's nicely paced music and gameplay to match for a nice relaxing round of Go.
,Recommended,468160,32608194,Posted: 20 June,all,Ricky,Great game. Would reccomend you buy! Make a free GO account on OGS and play here. Once you get better make sure to turn off hints or you will get too used to the crutch
76561198048897758,Recommended,468160,32182160,Posted: 4 June,all,scrwbll19,"""Ancient Go"" aims to be an app for total beginners to Go, which is great. Currently, outside of ""Ancient Go,"" the only other app out there on Steam is ""Crazy Stone Deep Learning -The First Edition-,"" which is $79.99. However, ""Crazy Stone"" is arguably meant for committed Go players, who are much stronger at the game. So, ""Ancient Go"" is a cheaper alternative for ""Crazy Stone"" that allows the Steam community to start playing Go at a cheaper price. That said, ""Ancient Go"" has its strengths and weaknesses.+ A relatively flexible and potentially strong AI.+ Access to the Online Go Server (OGS) via a free account, which allows for getting a rank.+ Tutorials to get started.+ Allows for changes in board size.+ Can change scoring rules.+ Beautiful GUI.+ Steam achievements for encouraging beginners.+ Can play against friends on Steam (I have yet to try this.)+ The developer seems to listen to user input, judging by changes made in the past.+ The app helps bring awareness of Go to the general gaming community via Steam.+ Supports different rule sets.+ The developer appears to be working on further updates for the future.+ Visual hints included for weaker players.+ Undo feature to allow players to learn from mistakes.- The AI tends to play tactically, not strategically, even at stronger levels.- The jump between the difficulty levels is too large for people to smoothly progress through.- Does not allow players to add handicap stones.- Currently cannot chose sides with the AI.- Currently cannot vary the komi with the AI.- Capture Go for beginners is not available as an option.- Little advantage to the online play now, unless one's internet browser is broken.- Only access to the OGS server is allowed. (KGS, IGS, TyGem, etc. are not available.)- Does not teach Go terminology (i.e., atari, ko, tsumego, tesuji, joseki, etc.)- Does not recommend/provide other resources (i.e., books, Go problems, etc.)- Cannot change graphic settings.- AI tends to play moves that make no sense (i.e., self-atari, keeps playing when no points can be gained), even at stronger levels.- Does not explain the differences between the different rule sets.- Does not have abilities that would help users teach, save, or review games natively (unless I am missing something here).All-in-all, the app does what it sets out to do, but I would not say that it encourages players to keep playing for long periods of time and keep coming back for more. I recommend it only for the sake of the Go community to keep growing and going strong."

I haven't played it much yet, but from the couple quick games I tried I can tell this will be my primary go playing interface whenever possible. It could really use chatting with your opponent in OGS games, but otherwise it seems very feature-packed."

I'm hopeful that the game will evolve and can see the direction and intent and for that I am satisfied to recommend. However, it's not a finished product and it shows. I wouldn't quite compare it to Ikari Warriors, but I just did. Price is right when the game is done. Please continue the good work started!"
,Not Recommended,468160,29280629,Posted: 15 January,all,sr71at,"Game vs AI:As for now, this feature is not fully implemented, because score calculations are totally wrong: uncoditionally ""dead"" groups are not marked as captured, so they are not taken into account when score is calculated.Graphics:No coordinates on a board.Stones are periodically (every 3-7 seconds) become blured (seems as unfocused image).Today is 15.01.2017, game is still in early access, I hope it will be polished in next few months. If so, I'll change my review later."

The recently added UNDO feature is very helpful for those moments when you've blundered and want a chance to try a different approach.The music and sound effects are calming.  The game is easy to get into and out of for those times when you'd like a challenge but not one that takes too long (assuming you picked a smaller board to play of course).Despite being early access, the game plays like a finished product. Keep up the good work9/10 holding out a star as I wait for hints :)"

I tried to take a snapshot but the game crashed due to memory.Currently I would not recommend it based on this scoring issue.Update: AI on 13x13 worked well today. The counting is still not as expected."
