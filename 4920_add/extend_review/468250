Not only when you log in there is a literal UI that pops up only allowing you to play if you click the ""I understand"" button after you read ""its early access"" ""you will run into bugs, server issues and missing contents for this test... but also after 15 minutes of being patient and giving the game a chance(not expecting much seeing its in early release) the tutorial loaded and I got in finished the tutorial and am past it... It just is pathetic how people are complaining about not even being able to get into the game because they missed the chance to get a steam code(steam code is only temporary, hopefully) while half the people that got in talk S*** about this game when it hasn't even been 3 hours yet... personally it frusterates a patient person like me when you see such impatience and ignorance from people that were lucky enough to get in and the people that didn't are the patient ones and gets their effective spot taken by the ignorant onessummary :this game hasn't been out for day, ffs give the devs a chance...(for what they have now, i'm impressed how much they have improved based on their older titles, warfare 1944/1917 let alone the fact of all the effort put in to a f2p game; its amazing)\\9/10 for a game released something like 1 hour ago ;P//"
,Recommended,468250,29926733,Posted: 14 February,all,Polite People,"Quite a nice little game, I like that it doesn't force you to waste real money on it, you can get gold by completing daily tasks such as ""Win 3 times as Russia"" or ""Kill 50 infantry units"".The levelling up process is not that slow, different weapons and kits allow you to cutsomize your units - you can make your tank into an infantry-grinder with HE shells and machine gun, or turn it into a tank killer by arming it with SABOT rounds and giving it an increased attack range.UPDATEThe game has left Early Access and now that if was released I can definitely recommend it for everybody who likes strategy games but can't be bothered to micro units every second. Warfare Online is a thinking man's game, not fast clicking one! :)Игра очень неплохая, вливать реал не принуждает, золото даёт за ежедневные задания типа ""Победи 3 раза за Россию"" или ""Убей 50 пехотинцев врага"".Прокачка довольно быстрая, разные наборы и оружие позволяют кастомизировать юнитов - можете превратить свой танк в противопехотного монстра с осколочными снарядами и КПВТ, или же сделать из него убийцу танков с БОПСами и СУО, повышающей максимальную дальность стрельбы.НОВАЯ ИНФОРМАЦИЯИгра вышла из Раннего Доступа и теперь я могу гарантированно посоветовать её всем, кто любит стратегии, но не желает микроменеджить юнитов каждую секунду. Warfare Online это игра для думающего человека, а не только и умеющего что быстро кликать! :)"

If you've ever played Warfare 1944 or even 1917 back on Armor Games you'll love this - these guys know exactly how to make a solid game. The multiplayer really kicks it up a notch too allowing you to throw down your different strategies against anyone but AI.

I remember playing their games in middle school. This game comes from almost a decade old games, Warefare titles(1917,1944), The Last Stand 1/2/Union City, and a few others. Flash games of the past that all gave hours of entertainment.Strategy?Now, this game goes in depth as strategy, mind over power to defeat your enemy, as Warfare online it's amazing how balanced the game is. In terms of pay to win for a free to play game, I've noticed none.-You units/vehicals/skill(airsupport) that can counter a troop/vehical your enemy has on the field instantly and change whether your enemy decides to make an assault for territory.-In terms of troops/vehicals, they are all customizable. You can change the gun from infantry, change their vests, their unique skillset, and their skin to fit the field. Same goes for vehicals, tanks, humvees, APCs, you can change their ammo, gearset, camo, all this to give a push to fit your build.**Servers are now working since last update** (Too many players = SERVER CRASHED FIRST HOUR :P)""NOW FIXED""Downsides:1. Tutorial is boringI surely recommend the game to anyone who is into strategy without a doubt. Get past the tutorial and give it a go."

,Recommended,468250,29806376,Posted: 9 February,all,TheRyderShotgun,"Whatever you do, don't change graphics quality while in a mission.Now that that's out of the way...If you ever played Warfare 1944, it's basically that, but in 3D (whatever engine they're using)Performance isn't the best, especially if you spam infantry. The animations looks pretty good. The sound effects aren't bad. Music sounds generic. Graphics are passable, though the maps are one single/three lanes depending on how you see it, but it's basically a single corridor with the odd piece of cover.Is it fun? Not really, if you compare it to other strategy games or the other Warfare games on browser, but it isn't boring. Yes I said the older Warfare games were more fun, but those are finished games and this is early access. The older games certainly didn't have multiplayer but the missions were fairly interesting, and had some more units like the man-portable mortar and the officer, as well as a morale system that let you win in a battle of attrition instead of merely destroying their base as a win condition.The existing units do have some interesting customization going on though, as you can tweak them to fit a slightly different role, but there are no stat numbers on the table, and I don't read stats, but there are people I'm sure who would prefer numbers over green and red words.Is the game interesting? Yeah, I'm interested. It's free so, there's no investment other than time on my end, though there are those Supply Box things...STORY TIME!-Convinced friend to play game-Realize there's no way to play with friends-Complain about it to each other for a few minutes and then joining our own games-At my second game, as i was winning, friend sent me a steam message-""wtf stop rap*ng me you c*nt""-Realize i was playing with friend-proceeds to r*pe friend-game crashed after winning"

It's like hearthstone of strategy games. Rock paper scissors type of thing. It's not for everyone but anyone who has ever played flash games will recognize the design because it's the same studio that brought some of flash favorites like 1917 and 1944.This is a game that's good for 10 to 20 minutes a day. To relax and play casually. And it is a good game. Balance wise it's actually pretty darn good already. Some frustrations that people have with this game are there by design.It does have a low population though, 100 concurrent online players which makes it hard to have a good matchmaking. I've been racking up a 90+% winrate with different unit outfits and factions for a while now because i'm a veteran of TUG OF WAR games.The game is good"

It's just a couple of clicks, right? Wrong. You need a plan. You always need a plan. The plan determines how you build your platoon, what support and ops you bring along, which squads you deploy first, which covers you select, and so on.There are some issues in the current version, which is early access. None of them are game breaking.The matchmaking is reasonably good, given the player base. Having a good plan is more important than half the upgrades...... but still not better than the elite support options, which are best obtained with real money. Those can be game breaking, if they are kept in the current state. About two minutes in a game, a paying customer can throw 3 heavy tanks at your 5-6 infantry units. Sure, there are devs whose wages must be paid. I'm a dev, I know. But the game must also balance player base versus greediness. Nobody will pay to fight against the other 2 players online. Because it's a 2 player game and they will need to take turns ;)"
76561198049022043,Recommended,468250,29999784,Posted: 17 February,all,Orange65,"I'm a fan of the original two flash strategy games con artist has put out : warfare 1917 and warfare 1944. When I saw this game I was instantly excited because I remembered those fun classics that entertained me when I was younger.It feels like a sequel to those warfare games; but more like a card game than the originals. The overall battle scheme still feels similar in how it plays out.Things to keep in mind:Pros:*Great card based strategy.*Simple and easy to pickup : hard to master.*Clear counter pick strategies both on and off the battlefield.*It's early access : it's going to only get better.Neutral:Feels more like a card game than a strategy warfare game. While retaining elements of both.Cons:-Multiplayer functionality is a bit lacking at the moment.-Limited ""reinforcements"" so your strategies are a little less flexible once your on the field.-Only a couple orders you can give to troops on the field (currently)-It's early access : it's still lacking some features you might expect.I'm not entirely sure how to feel about this game personally, but I certainly feel like it's a high quality game I would recommend to fans of strategy card games, and for that reason : I give it a thumbs up.I'd love to see this game improve and expand on what's already here, but what's already here is already entertaining enough to be fun.I especially want to see some new strategy options in the future (being able to tell your soldiers to retreat and hold position would be a great start). I feel like the reinforcement cap is a double edged sword as well: while I feel every loss, I also feel constrained in my strategies. No ""grand infantry charges"" or anything like that. (maybe a different game mode?) Lots of room to change the game and improve,"

(The Operation card called salvage operation that gives you 1 supply or something for losing a vehicle. The reason it's op is because it gives you benefits without any drawbacks.

of time it takes to download and install, how ever, some people dont understand the concept of ""early access"" games, of course there will be bugs and balance issues, thats a given, even with all the issues this game has at this moment, its still not in the least bit unplayable or enjoyable. the very concept of this game is great, battle players online, custom build your units gear sets and weapons, finding that perfect balance of power and effectivness to compliment your custom support cards. the battles themselves are very fun, very chill type of battle pace, meaning, combat is not to fast or over whelming to keep up with, but is not to slow that you find yourself board.currently there is only 2 countries to play as, they each have there own perks and cons, im sure many more options will be added. there is a ton of support cards along with a decent amount of custom gear and wepons to equip your units with, im sure there will be tons more to come too so im looking forward to this games progress.about the ""pay-to-win"" thing...dont listen to the people that are screaming its a pay-to-win, they are all either angry children who are using there parents credit cards or are voided of any type of logical reasoning abilities :(its not pay-to-win, in fact, if it was, i would be the first one to scream it at the top of my lungs and declare war against the developers....just ask the developers of ark lol :)the fact is, the only thing that you can not buy with game earned currency is the premium membership, the premium membership ONLY gives you a 50% increase in the credits and xp you earn each battle, thats it.there is the gold currency that you can buy with cash, you can use gold to buy supply boxes that give you support cards, however, the gold currency is NOT exclusive to only cash paying players, in fact, the game literally shoves gold down your throat, no lie.there are vast amounts of missions and quest to complete that give you hefty gold amounts, for instance, do 1 thousand damage to enimies base, easy, 5 matches won will be enough to complete this task, you get paid 50 gold, ALSO, there is another mission for winning 3 matches, payout is another 50 gold.....ALSO, while trying to compete those task, i happended to destroy 25 units of infrantry...which is another 50 gold...ALSO, destroyed 10 enimies vehicles, which is 35 more gold,ALSO, i must of completed a few more missions that i didnt even know i had because after about 5-7 victories i already had enough gold to buy the 7 supply box pack.....i can be mistaken but i think that the 7 pack is worth around 10 bucks or so...maybe a bit more or less, i honestly cant say because i had no need at all to spend real cash since the game just hands out gold like candy, however, that will stop me from buying premium for the simple purpose of supporting a game that deserves it.hell, i may even buy gold or credits even if i dont need them for the purpose of supprting the devs.and im poor as hell, so that speaks volumes......yes, there are some issues, and here they are.1-matchmaking....match making is the worse issue this game has, luckily i have not had any problem finding a match, but the real problem is the matchmaking itself, you can be completely new and never played a single battle yet, but the game will still match you against a player who has been playing for a while and has insane upgrades to all there units.meaning, you have no chance of winning unless the other guy is a idiot.my first match went like this......the guy sent 1 unit of riflemen at me.....i had 2 units of machine gunners and a unit of riflemen, all 3 were ducked in cover.....his 1 unit ran up in the open, in full range of all 3 of my units, his unit managed to kill all 3 of my units......that were behind cover...while his units had no such cover at all, they just stood in the open, mowing my units down.i then sent units to take cover near my base in attempt to defend it against that one unit.....didnt work.....his units seemed to of had there range upgraded, this meant that they just stood there, shooting all my units without any of my units even being able to fire at them.i then tried to rush my units forward so they could get in range, they all died before they could even fire a shot. at this point, he had 2 tanks and more infrantry at my bases front lawn, there is no cover at your actuall base so all the units i dispatch just simply got shot the ♥♥♥♥ up instantly. was a very unfair match.unfair match making happens all the damn time, once a player pushes to your base, your done, there is nothing you can do unless  u get extremly lucky and get the perfect set of supports cards you need.very unlikey to happen.if units had cover or some type of buff the moment they spawn at your base, then it all would be fine, sadly, this is not the case.so every single game scores always look like this......#yourbase=0 health------- #enimies base=250 health, or visa versa.(250 health is full health by the way) so there is no such thing as a close battle, you either crush your enemy or your enemy crushes you, there is no in-between.thats pretty much all the negative about this game, i cant seem to think of anything else. with all that being said, its a great ♥♥♥♥ing game in totality and is very fun....if you have the patients to upgrade all your units so that you dont get ♥♥♥♥♥ed on every game by more experienced players.oh, and not being able to retreat is stupid, sometimes units dont follow instructions.would be nice if we had more manual control over units."

,Recommended,468250,29998643,Posted: 17 February,all,Archeol,"One of my most favorite strategy games. I suck so much at Heartstone and many other strategy games (including ones like chess), but here you have control over how things go as things play out instead of pure luck or absolute control (which can suck if you can't think that far ahead). Based on your quick decision making like a true commander on the field, you will have either an AMAZING success or be an ABSOLUTE failure... or even PERFECTLY draw :D! There are many tactics to use and many strategies so you can become a master in various different ways (i.e. defensive, offensive, all infantry units, dependent on tanks, dependent on light vehicles, etc.). You can always change your strategy midbattle if needed so if you do an all out offensive and destroy yourself it's not too late to go defensive if you play things out right and the other gets cocky.Basically, it's a really well made strategy game and definitely a great game in general to have in your collection if you somehow do not get addicted to playing it everyday."

But When it comes to loading the game ;-; It kills the mood and i spend Way more time trying to fined a match then i do  Playing the game. Yes i understand this is in early acess So I hope In the future this can be fixed.I Like the XP system and the costom platoons but like i said Load time Kills the mood. So I Must say though I Love the game So those that play be warned about the time you will spend Seraching for a game.

I love everything about the game, obviously many bugs to fix as of the early access but natural for games to go through that stage.I'd actually like to see more content such as Clans/Squads and more Nations, I'd also love to see more control over the units such as specific locations not just push forward and take cover, in the future.I see a ton of potential in this game and being a nerd and fan of Military History I dig this game...Very excited to see what Con-Artist can do... Good luck, and I hope you play this game too!"

Sometimes they shoot the right enemy, sometimes not. Sometimes they seem to just stand there, waiting to die. You pretty much just chose troops to counter the enemy, then watch and hope for the best.There's a card-system in the game where you have 20 cards with you in battle, but only 3 at a time. These cards are all that really matters. Depending on which cards are drawn for you you'll either win or lose.The fights never feel balanced, where the tides of war go bothways. Depending on RNG. either you or your enemy gets the upper hand within the first minutes, and that's the one who will win.However, there is a strange fun factor with the game. It's early access and it might improve. I might come back to take a new peek a few months from now."

Units now move smoothly, cover actually helps, and now the experience is a bit more enjoyable. However, I still cannot recommend this becase the lack of content. If you want to support a game in Early Access that has promise, then yeah, play on.The game seems competant, but at the moment, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. Load times are rather poor, and the movement system is janky at best, with units moving in stutters, and getting stuck on cover, despite it not being active."
