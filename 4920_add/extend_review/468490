Kept me going until the end.+ The level design shows variety and all the levels are great fun.Overall I can recommend Neon Space!"

Honestly I bought the game just for the trailer playing ""Alan Walker - Faded"". You control a ball in timemode through a labrinth of rotating and elevating neon platforms. The playtimes for each level will be rated for bronze, silver or gold medal. Additional you have 2 special abilities slow (slows down every movement) and blink (lets you jump over red moving bars). The abilities are recharged after a while shown with progress bars inside your ball. Unfortunately the control of blink is not very precisely and pure luckbased how far you jump and even if you jump at all. I just died on several bars for no reason. So I must say the first few levels were fun. But lateron levels require a proper use of blink which seems impossible. At some higher stages and the boss level some superfast turretshots are used extrem hard to dodge. They even glitch sometimes throiúgh walls which is quite annoying. It's a pity that there are still bugs which must be worked on. Hopefully Neon Space 2 has a better feeling of gameplay,"

Graphics are minimalistic, but colorful, and the soundtrack is not too techno, or too mellow.Addictive gameplay will keep you coming back for more, plus the difficulty level increase slowly as you go, so that it does not become too complicated too quickly.They do not tell you this in the game, but you can use your mouse to control the direction you want your ship to go in.Then you can use the keys to move forward, back, and what have you.For the low price of one dollar, I highly recommend this game.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrK6H1M6wsA&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8&index=72"

I do have to say that the inertia for stopping is bang on, as any more would have caused our lil' protagonist to behave frustratingly.The lovely music, splendid atmosphere, and the visual polish engaged me for the entire playthough."
,Recommended,468490,28356624,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,OctoberFox,"Short and SweetThe object is simple; navigate from your starting position to the goal. Getting to the goal is of course the name of the game, and there are plenty of challenges keeping the player form it. The game is heavy on trial and error, at least up front. Once I got used to what I was dealing with like knowing what those pesky red circles did, or how they worked with red walls, I could figure out what to avoid or what to expect, not that it made some of the later stages considerably difficult.Minimalist design goes over well here. The levels, obstacles, and player avatar are very minimally designed; the colors look like the basic RGB colors. There is nothing flashy at all about the presentation. The background music is nice, plenty of variety, but nothing that will stand out.The controls took some getting used to, but I didn't have a big problem with them for the most part. I used a game pad but there were times my input to “Restart” a level were not recognized and I had to mouse click and grab the game pad very quickly again. There were also some odd graphical and game play bugs. Pausing for a few seconds on a stage with deadly red particles then resuming would cause the particles to rain down in a wall of death.Another issue is that some of the red walls may be passed on some stages, but not on others, making things feel a bit inconsistent, though as mentioned trial and error is part of the experience, and losing isn't harshly punished as the player gets infinite lives without any real penalty.If I have any further complaints they would be largely niggling ones. I wish the game was a little more visually flashier, giving things a truly “neon” shine. I wish the background tones were adjusted in some areas as it would occasionally become easy in a tricky move to lose myself in the floating nebulae, which in some cases caused me to retry. Again, these are trivial complaints.With plenty of stages, and some ambiguous timings on winning stars (or “medals”) for completing stages faster, Neon Space has a lot to offer for a buck. I enjoyed myself, this really felt a bit like a classic arcade style game from the 80s. Maybe a vector mode would have been cool, who knows?Pros:Challenge progresses reasonablyModest replay valueCrisp presentationGood soundtrackGame pad friendlyCons:Visually basicSome bugsInconsistent challenges at partsA fun little puzzler that was worth every penny. Not a bad way to spend a dollar and a few hours."

It's the same in each level, dodge the red lasers and avoid the acid rain? This makes the game very boring, very quickly.I can not recommend this at the low price of €1, not even at a sale, stay away and play something more worth your time.I can say the only reason you may get it is if you like electronic and dubstep, both of which don't go very well with the setting of the game, I would personally have chosen something more symphonic or ambient. Unfortunately there's no way to fully mute the game, the music can be turned off but the sound effects will still be there.Rating: 2 / 10."

Getting used to the turning took me a while, and most of my deaths were from me straight barreling into the red zones by the tiniest fraction (it almost feels as though the hitbox is octagonal rather than circular, and slightly larger tahn the sprite- slightly).I love how the level designs discouraged me from getting too impatient, and that impending sense of doom as I realized that I'd just jumped over a barrier which turned around and began bearing down on me- augmented by my panicked use of the slowing power was just /delicious/. Every time I caught myself thinking ""Well at least X isn't happening"", X happened.I didn't quite make it to the end, as after about an hour I finally saw a level that I just 'noped' right out of, but I intend to go back and finish it after this adrenaline rush peters out- heck, I may even start from scratch. After all, I just so love suffering.13/10 would panic and run into a stationary kill-wall again.Bonus points for the great soundtrack."

It Took me 1.5 hours to complete all levels, and 2 hours to get 3 stars on all levels (including a snack break).  I didnt even know there was a ""slow"" power until the last level I was trying to master. So two tips: Read how to play XD and all levels are possbile to master without 1 of your 2 abilities (slow).Still worth the few hours."

Luckily there is some Ambient music in the game that's the only reason why I not raged. Neon Space is a minimalistic adventure/puzzle game. I really love games in that genre. I must say for a game that looks so simplistic, It still made me really happy to play it.Pros:+ Good music in different genres+ Simplistic looks but quite a hard game to play+ Speedrun worthy+ Trading cardsCons:- Almost unplayable with controller- I got killed so many times because of the misplacement of my Mouse marker8.5/10 This game is another gem in the world of minimalistic games. A must have for lovers of that genre!"

But since this game can reward you with different medals namely: bronze, silver, or gold even though it's not required, perfectionists must think on the move and act swiftly with their slowdown and teleport ability to get the gold!The other plus is it's sweet EDM style music!Great game at a good price!"

But the levels are very repetitive and the controls are mediocre and can't be remapped. Even if you get this game free, there's better stuff to do with your time."
