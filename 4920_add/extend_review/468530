,Not Recommended,468530,29449259,Posted: 23 January,all,Dr. Mircow,"A Date In The Park is a 45-minute long point ‘n’ click adventure game made available for free on Steam.The story is about this guy, Lou, who visits Portugal and gets this date with a random woman, Catarina, he met at bar one night. She tells him to meet her by a duck pond in a park the following day, so you can now see where the title comes from. The next day, however, Catarina is nowhere to be seen, but Lou is determined to meet her by all means and keeps searching for her around the park. In time, Lou notices Caterina is actually leaving him clues, so he figures out that she is playing some sort of a game with him as he recalls telling her he likes mystery games. Basically, that is the premise of the story.Visually, A Date In The Park looks amateurish at best, perhaps downright ugly, but at least the visuals are kept consistent throughout the game, so for me that was not a problem. The sound design is minimalist with just ambient sounds of birds chirping in the background and there is no voice acting which, considering the effort put in the presentation, is perhaps better off.There are not too many puzzles in this game and the ones present are extremely easy to decipher, so walkthroughs are not neccesary. There is one puzzle which feels out of place though, and this is when Lou has to enter a building, unauthorised, to get an object. Now this leaves A Date In The Park more of an narrative experience than a traditional point ‘n’ click adventure game because even the interactivity with the environment and other characters is low. Aside from a receptionist who Lou never sees behind the counter, a gardener who can only speak Portuguese and has about two minutes of screen time, and someone at the end, there is no other human to ever interact with in the park. So the majority of the game consists of just walking around the park, making some observations, backtracking from different locations to solve a puzzle, or witnessing an event. Probably the most fun you can get out of the game is when you are given the chance to name a small ducky, as it can result in some funny dialogues depending on how you name it.Similarly, all the achievements are also easy to obtain as long as you visit or check everything, and should be able to unlock them in one playthrough. For achievement hunters, this is good news, hence why I wanted to point it out. In my case, there was one achievement which I missed because I did not bother to follow a certain path after a certain event.Of course, the selling point of the game is Lou’s journey strolling around the park looking for Catarina and, more importantly, the inevitable twist at the end. In regards to the journey, it is painfully mundane and uninteresting, except for two events; one at the pond and one outside a building, which raise some questions and can be a bit disturbing. In fact, the story, as a whole, is very thin. Appreciatively, an element of urgency is finally injected into the plot in the last five minutes, so we arrive at the big twist at the end. If you kept away from any spoilers, then you prepared yourself well for the full impact. Sadly, the ending is fairly uninspiring. It has a shock element thrown in for the sake of it that leaves you scratching your head more than anything. That is it. I believe the game could have gone with a few different endings based on your actions in the park, but no, you are stuck with this ending. The developer could have expanded upon the ending, and meaning of it, a bit more.In conclusion, A Date In The Park may be worth playing to witness its big twist and only ending which is, at least for me, underwhelming and not too cleverly executed. Overall, a very forgettable experience that you will surely forget within a few days. While the game is free of charge, the time with it cannot be refunded, so I am sparing you an hour of your free time by not recommending it. If you want something mechanically similar but better, and free as well, look no further than Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok available on Steam. I do believe A Date In The Park could have been a great freeware if the ending was expanded, had proper puzzles and more interactivity, but ultimately there are better alternatives out there than this little game has to offer."

Don’t expect too much of the game though, it will last maybe half an hour, 60 minutes tops. It’s a self-contained, linear story, don’t expect multiple endings as well. To sum up: it’s not a point-and-click game for everyone, but fans of the genre will most likely relax and enjoy the story."

Even though I used a guide the game was fun and ending was unexpected (I did feel something bad is gonna happen but not this wtf). Five minutes after uninstalling it I thought.. hey maybe there was another way to end the story? And sadly, no, there's only one ending. The game is nice but main character's action that defines his end is so minor that it would be great to make it an option. This game made me want to replay it, but by not adding another ending developers have missed a great opportunity.I still recommend this game, I enjoyed it and that's what really matters."

I thought the story very poor. It certainly didn't suck you in.  I hate to say anything bad about anybody that puts in the effort to make a game so thanks for letting it be free!  But you may want to work on your interface/hotspots. Good luck. Thanks for the effort!"
