76561198015597218,Recommended,468800,23216565,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,Helm,"I think this game holds much potential. It feels smooth and responsive. The jumping mechanic feels familiar to anyone who has played games like tf2; Where you can rocket-jump by shooting at your feet, or dashing mid-air. If you then mix that with the twitchyness of Quake, give it a flashy ps1-polygon aestethic and add a bow and arrow, you kind of got this game; Which is really cool!However, I've only had like 2-3 matches in my 1.7 hours of playing, and you can't even explore the maps without any other players, so if you don't have any to play with, you basically only got the training grounds. Maybe it could be fixed by making waiting for a match more exciting or atleast let you explore the map you're about to play, so you're not only stuck in a lobby. Or giving you some sort of incentive to wait for a matchI really want to play more of this game because it holds the potential to be really enjoyable, so I do hope more players come around!"

A few friends and I had decided to pick up this game because my friend said it was really fun, but in the end, I was kind of dissapointed. The game lacks gameplay. There are very few gamemodes and they all just feel the same. The lobby sizes are only up to four people therefore, it creates more rivalry between people, but it would be more fun to have more people playing at the same time. My last statement is about how many people know about the game. The audience of this game is very small. Today I only saw seven people playing the game and they were all in private lobbies, therefore there is nobody to play with. This game should be free, and is not worth $5. I'm now saying it's a waste of money. It just isn't popular yet!"

You can either jump into a game with 3 other random players or just set up a private game to play with friends..It's quite a 'Quake-Style' shooter that's very fun and has some rather interesting powerups that make the game entertaining.The only negative that I'll say right now is that Controller Support needs to be worked on a bit more. Other than that its a good, simple FPS that can be highly entertaining."
,Recommended,468800,23186070,"Posted: 24 May, 2016",all,Obama,"Arkshot is a fast paced game that requires that you can aim and to plan ahead.You always need to keep track of your stamina. Your stamina drains when you sprint, jump or dash towards a direction. Without stamina you can't do fast moves or even shoot. So with no stamina you're an easy target.The aiming is challenging. With only a bow and arrow you have to keep in mind that the arrows sink pretty fast and does not travel at bullet speed. And without a crosshair you need to train your memory of where the center of the screen is to be a bowman of accuracy.There is also a handful of game modes and maps which brings variety to the game and leads to many hours of fun.Arkshot is a great game to play with friends. I had a lot of fun playing it!"

This charming arena shooter, obviously taking inspiraton from Quake and other arena shooters, is one of my current favorite games.Pros: free bow skins, free masks and taunts(sounds), large selection of maps and gamemodes, great gameplay.Cons: sometimes the chat freezes up, and the bow consumes a lot of stamina.Overall: 9/10 would recommend"

Get some freinds together and let the aiming salt enflow i hope for mask and content is added but if not thats ok. Defintly a good game for youtube videos and streams looking forward to playing it more.

The trailer basically shows what you will experience in game, and has a nice party style with lighthearted gameplay. I would recommend the game especially for groups as it is not too expensive."

,Not Recommended,468800,23403368,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,[TRC] Raven,"My review of Arkshot.Before we start I think I should clarify that I actually like this game.But Raven, if you like this game why are you saying you wouldn't recommend it?Well dear reader, here is your answer! First of all more people would read negative reviews, but this is my reason:Nobody plays this game at the moment.Now that wouldn't be such a problem. Cool, it's a really good game and it's obscure. So?Well, this game is purely multiplayer. Sure, there is a training but you can do nothing in it really. Because there is no singleplayer you can barely play. I mean, I haven't played much of the game, but I know I only spent a tenth of my time legit playing. Not too much of a problem, sure...But it shouldn't cost £5.99 if I cannot play it due to the lack of being able to play.Cons-You can't go singleplayer-Multiplayer usually doesn't work-Sometimes the chat bugs out and you can't talk-No voicechat-Polygonal graphics (I honestly don't mind but I know some people do)Pros-Awesome method of firing-Nice narration-The taunts are fantastic memes. I can do the sad trombone and also airhorns.-Getting a kill feels so satisfying-Diverse gamemodes-Innovative maps-Friendly community (Though very small)-Trading cards-Character customisation-Low learning curve-Really awesome powerupsHonestly? I rate 10. But due to the fact I haven't been able to play against 3 people yet and I've played for 103 minutes so far...That's not good. I've been waiting for too long. When more people play it would be fantastic so I think you should get it to help people play, but for now, I don't recommend it. I would want you to play but at the same time, for now, you wouldn't get your moneys worth.-Raven"

Note that the time I was searching for servers was at 930 PM US east.The gameplay itself (in practice mode) is very awkward but obviously meant for you to play it for a while to get used to the movement, ammo, aiming, timings, and of course the powerups...but with no players it is impossible to tell how that would feel in combat.Definitely don't recommend solely on the premise of no players."

76561198329436551,Recommended,468800,30021654,Posted: 18 February,all,I'm sorry,"Well, where to start....I originally got this game form a firend of mine. I enjoyed playing it with him and I still do, and will definetly recommend it to you, dear reader.I think this is a cool game as it tosses all things an average FPS would have such as a crosshair and a health bar for a one hit, one kill policy along with some predicting required for where your arrows are going to land.  These features make it seem retro yet still fresh and exciting. If you are wondering, Each fully charged arrow is similar to te huntsman arrow in Team Fortress 2, except slightly bigger. Just like any other review would say, it will require more people to enjoy as the most i've ever seen in one region is 5. If I were to give a negative point to this game it would be that a lot of the maps are very easy to fall into a pit/void/lava for newer players ( I'm guilty of this too) because of the very fast moving characters. Also, some power ups are very overpowered (physics arrow) or sets you in LUDICROUS speeeeeds like the coffee."

The game suggested I make a game since there were none but no one ever joined so I can only play the training area which is about 5 minutes worth of fun before I get bored. Game looks good but I can't recommend it if I have yet to see another player online."

It would be awesome if they could expand this to be 3v3 or 4v4 even.  It is a very fun concept, but NO ONE plays it online so don't expect to play it with strangers, and there are only a very few game types and maybe 5 maps it seems.Fun hijinks, silly fun for friends, but for much more than that, go look elsewhere.P.S. WTF devs, you can't even do a team game??  (its FFA only folks)"
