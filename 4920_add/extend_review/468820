I usually don't have a problem with heights, but vertigo really hits in this game, it's amazing.For someone who loves space this is what VR is all about 10/10.I used a HTC Vive and motion controlls are used as ""laser-pointers""."

The scope and scale of what you see in this is amazing. If you have a headset, don't even hesitate. This is one of the original experiences that really helped me to realize the potential of VR, and it does NOT disappoint. I can't wait to see where it goes from here!"
,Recommended,468820,24287321,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,arleas,"When I was a kid, I used to go to the school library in Elementary school and pick out books about the solar system.  I loved reading all about how ""Mercury's orbit and rotational period are exactly 88 days so that it always keeps one face toward the sun"" and stuff like that.  Of course most of that is wrong/outdated information, but again, I was reading books published 20 years before I was born so that's to be expected.Well, anyway... what we have here is a nice little tour of the Solar System and you can get pretty up-close and personal with every single planet (and a few of the major moons and other dwarf planets).They start you out with a scale you can appreciate and then as the tour continues you get to see exactly how big (relative to Earth) Jupiter and Saturn are... Everything is shrunk down to 1/1000000th of its size but it's still pretty massive.  While the graphics aren't SUPER amazing, they're still jaw dropping in scale...though that effect is lost when you reach out to grab the planet to look at it closer and now it looks like a toy on the end of a stick.Each planet and some of the moons have trivia you can read about them.  It's probably the kind of thing that 20 years from now we'll learn is wrong and/or outdated and kids in the future will roll their eyes as us when we tell them stories about how Neptune is a darker blue than Uranus even though they're both comprised of a lot of methane.  ""No Grampa, it's the distortion from the graviton flux caused by a disturbance in the weak force that makes it APPEAR darker... Pfft!"" or something like that.Anyway, it's not a game, there's no objective to complete.  It's just a nice little guided tour through the solar system.  It's still very educational, and they're still working on it in Early Access so there's a chance that there could even be updates to some of the informaton as we learn new things.If you have an interest in Astronomy but don't care to delve into it too deeply, this is a great way to see our local neighborhood."

Would have loved to have this in my science classroom back in school. A perfect example of how VR can change how we interact and learn about universe. The main ""game"" itself involves a breath taking tour of the solar system (can be set to abbrievieted or extended)  that gives you right up close views of sol and theplanets of ours solar system. You are taking the perspective of an Astronaught and it really is quite stunning. You are presented with facts with each stop along the tour, with additinal options to learn more factoids, pull in and manipulate a 3D miniature of the star or planet being focused on,  or launch a probe where you can change trajectory and velocity to find how the different grabvity wells would effect your probe's flight path.     After touring the sun and planets (with mentions and sightings of significant moons) Then you are treated to some cool visulizations to show scale,  including comparing our star to much bigger ones such as Rigel and other massive stars. Then it extends out view to show how the sun would look from vacuum at various distances.   This is all set to a great instrumental soundtrack that fits the epic nature of the journey.My only wish is that after the tour I wanted to explore more lol, to travel out past our local system and probe the  vast and diverse spiral arms of the Milky Way, but of course that would be a huge undertaking.9/10   Would have paid attention more in science class if we'd had this as a teaching aid!"

I liked a lot also the roomscale mode (the chair is missing and you can walk into your ship) where on the handtracking side something more is needed (suggestion: Far Beyond is a great example in this, and support both handtraking than pad).Graphics is very polished, it's improved from DK2 time and any update I can see small but noticeable additions. The music is great, with some different themes and styles.It's an experience, not a game, and very likely something you would show to lot of people so the price is totally worth in my opinion. If you love celestial bodies, and missed to try this before, it's a very well spent money."

Of course there are things to improve, but that's normal in early access titles.

I also really liked the solar flares and generally the effect of stars' radiating light.Also - the experience gave me a feeling of actually traveling through space - at least more than the VR space sim games I've tried, which was very surprising! Enjoyable, yet strangely disconcerting.Made a much bigger impression on me than underwater VR experiences I've tried. Definitelly a keeper for my library! :)@Devs: Great job guys!

To actually experience the relationships in VR is something else.By the way: I am often looking for demos to show my family and friends why this hobby is worth the while. This program is an excellent chance to let the folks get huge eyes!One more thing: From time to time this is being compared to the Apollo 11 demo. Forget that, they are completely different.

I'd only just played/experienced Discover Space 2 and had been utterly blown away by it. So upon loading up Titans I wasn't initially impressed due to the graphics in comparison. I was thinking of a refund in the first few minutes. But upon hitting 5 mins or less into Titans I was suddenly drawn in and realised what the program was trying successfully to convey. This is an amazing piece of software especially if you are interested in astronomy. I will keep this now and return to it. The whole point of this game is to convey the sense of scale of our galaxy and in that it completely succeeds. I recommend this as an unforgettable educational experience."

It's presented as a ""tour"" where you are flown do different parts of the solar system, and then out to a couple of enormous stars, and it provides a lot of details that help you put things in perspective (distances are represented in terms of distance from Earth to the Sun, and planetary/solar sizes are described in terms of how many earths/suns would fit in bigger objects, etc).I encountered a couple of technical glitches- once when orbiting Jupiter my camera zipped way out of whack and far away from the planet (but things returned to normal when I resumed the tour) and there's a part where the program is supposed to decrease the scale of our solar system in order to set us up for a comparison to some much larger objects, but the scaling didn't happen when it was supposed to. (I think that kicked in a couple minutes later when we eventually flew to another star.)The symphonic music is nice, but I found myself wanting some Cosmos-y whooshes and rumbles during some silent or near-silent parts of the tour.Anyway, this would be a great way to showcase VR for anyone with an interest in space."

You fly around and stop at each planet to read more info, zoom in, spin the planets, or orbit around them before pressing play to resume the tour.During the auto tour, planets are 1 millionth real scale size. When you are at 89% complete, you zoom out to real scale and are located near the earth with the moon orbiting around. This was my favorite part. I sat there for like 10 minutes thinking about things like just how small 1 human is and just how tiny Apollo 11 was. Then I imagined that tiny dot shooting out to the moon. It seems so impossible (don't even bother to comment conspiracy theorists) at a real scale  perspective like this. I think most of us have lost just how amazing landing on the moon really is. My other favorite part was seeing our sun compared to other stars that make it seem tiny and would would swallow our solar system.I look forward to future content.

My two bugbears with it are that I'd greatly prefer it if there was an option for full-scale planets (which I appreciate might be an massive technical challenge for the devs), and there's no free-flight mode yet. This could be amazing with some work. As it is, it's only good."

And it is certainly a beautifully and well done information tour of our solar system.The problem is: That's all it is. Basically, what it is is a rail-ride through the solar system. Don't get me wrong, this game certainly has the potential to become an awesome ""feel like in a space ship"" sim, and this is exactly why I am willing to give it the thumb up, and if you want to support someone who tries to create this, please, by all means, do so!But please be also aware that in the current state, it is ""only"" a very well done tour of our solar system. No ""game"", so to speak, more an information tour. It is vastly better than watching something like that on TV, by some margin, especially when you stand in front of tthose huge stars that make our own sun seem so tiny in comparison. Nothing you could simply watch could be as awe inspiring."

And one hell of an experience at that.I went through the tour my first time and was blown away, but the true fun of the game came from watching friends react to it.I highly recommend this as one of the first VR games you try out."

I used it during the DK2 days and picked it up again - it's not a whole lot different at this point but it's such an excellent title I wanted to show support by buying it. Also the author is adding in a lot of new features as this moves along in early access, those additional features will make this a truly stunning educational title. If they had stuff like this as a kid I'd have been an astronaut."

The sense of scale you get is mind blowing.On HTC Vive the controllers are laser pointers, but you can also pick up and rotate planets around which was pretty neat.If you like space at all and have a VR headset this is highly recommended!"

If not, go check them out.   This does the same in VR.  It really does provide a sense of perspective.Quite a short experience for the price, but still early access."

Everything is handled really well to provide a top class VR experience of our planets and moons with lots of information available too from the menu panel system on the spacecraft.The uninterrupted views of each of the planets, their moons and the sun as you literally hang above them in space is an truly awesome experience  made all the easier by the tour system.  The size and positioning of the planets is vastly compressed to aid the exploration and also provide first hand comprehension of the relative sizes.  The ability to shrink each planet to a miniature version suspended on the end of the Vive controller and manipulate this in front of your eyes is a nice touch.The real distance between these astral bodies is well demonstrated towards the end of the tour as well as an introduction to the relative size of other stars in the Universe to our Sun.Simply stunning!  I look forward to future additions."
