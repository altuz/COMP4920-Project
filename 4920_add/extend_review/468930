Didn't really care if the monster was scary or not, because the atmosphere was already immersive enough. There are very bland horror games here on steam with tons of copy-pasted empty rooms, this is not one of them. Developers really put some effort into making an immersive locations. Sound is also good.Overall, if you are craving for sci-fi horror, it really fills the gap."

I did my best to look for the bright sides in the first hour of gameplay. But all of my patience eventually boiled off.1). It's nowhere near scary. Our main enemy appears to be dumb, deaf and nearly blind. You can just follow in his footsteps all the way (since he is always conviniently placed on your path wherever you need to go). There might be other things made to scare us down the road, but i didn't play long enough to discover them.2). Exploration is strictly prohibited. Every now and then you need to inject the antidote, which can only be found on your main route. You just don't have enough time to stray from it.3). You can screw up a save by getting to the checkpoint with only seconds of your life remaining, which means having to restart the entire game. That's the worst mistake a game designer can possibly make.4). Tons of useless visual effects. They are simply out of place.5). Hitches. At any rig, at any settings (altough that seems being gradually fixed).That being said, i'm wishing best luck to the author. You can surely do better, and i sincerely hope you will, one day."

Sneaking around and solving problems like locked doors.My time to beat: under 6 hours.Control: keyboard and mouseStory: a little blandBugs: none that I encounteredMotionsickness: about a 7 out of 10. A lot of running around corridors tends to make me feel queazy.This game wasn't totally great, but it wasn't bad either. The game AI was sort of annoying. At times the mob would see you when really it shouldn't have.What I really hated were 2 things: 1. The character you play is so out of shape, you can sprint for about 5 seconds before he becomes exhausted; 2. The character is addicted to a drug (which doesn't really have much of an explaination in the story) and you have to take a hit every few minutes just to stay sane and keep your vision from getting all wacky. Hence, you are basically a fat space man with a drug problem and it is annoying. as. ♥♥♥♥.The game itself is a cheers to Alien Isolation. Similar, but not nearly as good as Alien Isolation. Still it is a good game. Not horrible, but not the best either.Do I recommend it? Yeah, I think so. But since it is a short game with a somewhat boring ending, be sure to get it on sale."

Can't say something bad about this game, because it even has rebindable controls (rare thing in indie games)! Maybe it someway short but maybe this is for good - game not became boring. Only one aspect i can really critisize - hand computer text fonts are too small and blurred into almost unreadable condtion (but you need to read them in order to find door codes). Also about reading - your time in game is depends on your sickness level - so i absolutely have no time to read all those story texts in order to save my time and antidotes. And therefore i miss a half of the game backstory. Why they did this mistake - i don't know, but if you want to read all texts - prepare to spend all of your antidotes and die:) Also game not supports my native resolution of 1920x1200, but this is bearable. Anyway - i recommend this game for sure - it is scary, atmospheric and balanced. It was nice experience!"

I don't know how this game is not that popular. Ingame content is so very decent: sounds, texts, tons of readable-interactive items, realistic structers... i explore everything on my way and it really makes me go deeper and deeper in this game. Far of unknown is a constant feeling. Really unique setting and an awesome unexpectable plot."

The tension is great at the beginning and then it only grows! I enjoyed moments with monster chasing me through the corridors. Game is good for long winter nights. Looking forward for more games like that, I played many, and I can place this game in top3 of horror games."

This game was like 6 hour marathon of terror. I played games like Dead Space normally. I don't know what this games has, but it's like whole new level of horror. I will not forget this game for a long time. That is a horror I am certain I will not forget for a long time."

Game is not very long (like 10 hours max) but I think it is advantage. I would rather play short and well - polished game with every level created in good details, well - thought plot than a long (for no reason) game. I get here good game and it has everything I expected with well performanced details. Thanks!"
,Recommended,468930,24965162,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Green Knight,"I'm always unsure about buying games on their release date, its like rolling the dice hoping that the game is ready. This one was a pleasant surprise. It is indeed ready, and fun to play. Did you like the Amnesia series? Ever wonder what it would be like in space? Well you're in luck. This is not a FPS! There are no guns! It is a horror escape/survival game. Sneak, run, hide. Darkness is your friend. There's the standard array of access pickups like keycards and batteries, and lots of little clues like datapads and sticky notes to help piece together the story. Excellent atmosphere and backgrounds. Shadowing is top-notch. Its a good story, the heartbroken poetic artistic drunk captain has an awesome accent. Good setups and scares, I've been genuinely startled a few times already. As a Unity developer myself I appreciate a polished Unity title any day."

Environments are atmospheric, and often isolate the player. I like there is no stupid jump - scares, like in similar productions, but real scary situations. For the price that it is, I would strongly recommend purchasing it."

I am a fan of productions this kind and this one matches my taste perfectly.First of all - the climate. It feels like you are in danger all the time. Very claustrophobic locations with fitting music and sounds - ideal enviroment for me :D If you add to that good plot and terryfying monsters you will get the Phantaruk!This is just must-have position for horror and adventure fans.

The plot is presented by audio files that you gathering during the adventure - this is just making you feel more alone and scared. I like flashlight in this game - here you have battery system, so it is another thing to wory about. In this type of game it is poistive thing :) Toxins level system is also interesting - never found anything like it in other games. Level of toxins is connected with your fear - it maybe sounds wired, but works nice in the game. I am not a horror fan, but I have found this game very engaging! So I think I can reccomend it for everyone."

Of course I am nat talking about graphics - it is modern and very nice. As a fan of horrors, I am playing a lot, but this one needs to be commented and highlighted.

It's got interesting gameplay, great writing, entertaining VO, a frightening atmosphere, and even manages to provoke deep thought. An interesting setting mixed with a very well crafted story that doesn't get carried by unexpectable twists but by the way the story is continously presented to the player. Best space horror at the market right now."

Are the same looking muscle guys enemies really cause i can easily walk among them, dont even need to crawl, they attacked me only if i bumped into them - than why is the eye icon needed on the screen??? theres no stealth challenge in this. Also these guyy walking like they can hardly move (slowly, painfully, unwieldy) BUT in attack they are surprisingly fast and strong? they beat the player to death by two punches.environment: we are in the FUTURE, a hi-tech SPACESHIP and all the interiors, furnitures, the medical equipments! looks like nowadays??? so nothing is going to change or develop in the far future??? and people will still using post-it to leave messages?i dont know why this game called survival horror. and just about 2 hour gameplay....I didnt finish the game cause it lost my interest.This game has no creativty at all they just put some overused cliches and elements from other games."

76561198035599199,Recommended,468930,31439589,Posted: 29 April,all,johntohill,"This is a nice little survival space ship horror.  Definitely on the short side and a bit pricey for what it is, but you can tell there has been a lot of effort put into this and it's head and shoulders above a lot of the other indie horror games on steam.  It's a shame it just hasn't quite capitalised on its potential, but I still would recommend you give it a go, particularly if its on sale.The game is a lot like the other penumbra/amnesia games and their clones, but where this game mixes things up is it's unique mechanic.  Without spoiling any of the plot, in short: you're infected.  This means your toxicity level ticks up.  And constantly!  There's no escape from your rising infection.  Unless you scour the levels for antidote which resets your toxicity level to zero, before it starts all over again.  Now this encourages you to move quickly, but you also need to be careful, as evil creatures lurk in the dark.  Unfortunately this naturally created tension is offset somewhat by the fact you find so many antidotes with even a cursory exploration of the ship to the point when any sense of urgency is lost.  A harder difficulty mode with faster lurgy ramp-up and fewer antidotes would have been welcome.  Same with the flashlight.  I barely had to use mine, and there was no need to conserve as batteries were being thrown at you left, right and centre.Another great step was to get rid of the HUD entirely which boosts immersion but you can find out how close you are to danger/death by checking your wrist-display via right-clicking.  This gets supplanted briefly later when you wear a gasmask with a HUD.In short, the gameplay can be described as follows: lurk around in shadows, find keycards/notes with passcodes to unlock doors, avoid monsters and get out safely.  There is no combat.  The monsters come in 2 varieties, nearly completely blind and deaf humanoids who flock in numbers, to single lumbering bi-pedal beasts with sharp eyes and even sharper noses.  They can literally smell you out if you get too close.  Their movement could be a bit janky at times but most of the time you see them you're too busy running the other way to notice.  There is a brief sighting or two of a headcrab-type creature in scripted events but this never comes to anything beyond that.Plot is delivered mainly through found notes and audiologs of the ship's captain.  Voice-acting is reasonably competent.  Sound in general was an odd one for me though.  When you hear the beasts nearby, I didn't get a great sense of where they were, what direction they were in, or whether they were on the other side of a wall.  It just didn't quite sound right, but maybe that was just me.What I did want from the game that it lacked can be summed up as just more!  More levels, more variety in enemies, and more interaction beyond keycards and the occasional button press/wheel turn (althrough there were a few cool means to bypass barriers which I won't spoil)To sum up, a well-crafted horror experience that shows potential and that you should definitely pick up and support the devs!"
