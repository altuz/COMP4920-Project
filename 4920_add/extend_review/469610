(which is doesn't technically, just wish the story were longer, but there's countless things to explore and mess around with!)"
76561198063617392,Recommended,469610,31350124,Posted: 24 April,all,Taymless,"Remember that time you went to the movie theater. What did you spend, like $10 maybe $12? Oh, and you brought your girlfriend too, right? Cause you totally have a girlfriend. And then you bought popcorn of course, cause what kind of loser brings his girlfriend to the movies and doesn't buy her popcorn. So two movie tickets and popcorn, what did that cost, like I dunno, $29.99 or something. Well then you broke up and now look at you, all you are left with is clogged arteries and a distant memory of a dumb movie you saw with a girl you lost because you were too cheap to buy some rootbeer. Everyone knows you need something to drink with popcorn dude.Well don't make the same mistake again. Forget the movies, forget the overpriced popcorn, they're for suckers anyway. Eat in, buy this game and remember, you may not have your girlfriend anymore, but you'll always have Rick. Oh and I guess Morty is in the game too, but let's get real, it's all about Rick. I know it's called Rick and Morty but we all know Rick is the real genius here and Morty, well, Morty's an idiot. And you get to play as a Morty, which I guess makes you the idiot, but you already knew that, because you forgot to buy the rootbeer.After scrolling through like 300 reviews I realized most of the negative reviews are because of the price to content ratio so I won't comment anymore on that. Let's just say if you're the type of person that skimps on popcorn and drinks at the movies, you'll probably want to keep that $30 in your piggy bank where it can collect some dust and decrease in value as the economy slowly sinks further into dispair day after day.Here's the real review for the game.Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality is a wonderfully polished game full of everything you love from the TV show; witty humor, unexpected racism, and good dose of exestential dread. It has a decent amount of replay value in its handfull of mini games, collectables and random shenanigans, but the game can be completed in less than two hours. After almost 3 hours, I still feel like there is more to discover because of the meticulous detail put into the game. The game is split up into sections that you can go back to at any time, which is great for showing off to friends. Without giving anything away, I can say that the game was full of brilliant tributes to some of my favorite moments from the TV show in a fresh, new way. The game developers cleary have a love for Rick and Morty and it shows in every delicious morsel of Rickality that your eyes can eat while your face is in an electrified box.If you call yourself a R&M fan and have a VR system, you should have this in your game collection.If you have no idea what R&M is, you should go watch the TV show immediately and then come back to this game if you enjoyed it.If you don't like R&M, what are you doing reading this super-long-winded-review?Like, seriously, are you still reading this?Go rethink your life choices.Then come back and buy this game."

,Not Recommended,469610,31259196,Posted: 20 April,all,dial up dong,"First and foremost, the things the game does right. It's pretty hilarious, just as you would expect from Rick and Morty, and had me laughing the whole time. The graphics are interesting.. but it is odd to see the characters 3D-ified, even if they obviously had to be for the games sake.The gameplay was fun, if not even a little difficult at times with the puzzles. Lots of cameos by characters, but no real big appearances other than Rick and Morty. All in all while a great experience, it was very very short.. with not much to do after.Without spoiling anything, there are a couple mini games at the end, one of which is akin to a Space Pirate Trainer, but more shallow. Then there is another simon says puzzle like game, where you try to get the best score. A few collectable cassettes, and you have to find a certain character.All in all I guess I am just a little disappointed since there are games in the same price range for VR that offer a lot more content/playtime, and I feel like the price is so high for this just for the fact that Rick and Morty's name is on it and they can charge that much.Justin Roiland has another VR game called Accounting that is similar to Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality but free, without any copyrighted characters. While only about 45 minutes long, it offered the same experience in terms of quality.I feel like at best this game should have costed $15, and a lot of people are going to pay the full price because it's R&M.Not trying to start drama, or be inflammatory, just a word of caution and hoping to start a discussion with others who have played."

,Recommended,469610,31269390,Posted: 20 April,all,Zizi Thrush,"A more accurate description of the game would be Job Simulator: Rick And Morty edition. The game is as fun as job simulator but suffers in similar ways that JS did.The writing was good, and may exceed most VR experiences out there right now, but it doesn't hit the same marks as the show itself. A big part of Rick and Morty's humor comes from the delivery and timing. In this experience, it is very stilted. As with many games and experiences such as this, you have to pace yourself to not skip over dialogue which then slows down the delivery, and very little in RnM is slow. Rapid fire jokes, weaving Rick's cavalier attitude towards life and Morty's reaction to the things that are damaging him is the core, with some on display. Then some pop culture references played offhand, as a nod to the viewer and a wink when that reference is manipulated for a bigger payoff. Because of the sheer amount of these in RnM, it highlights the game's sparse writing and the delivery doesn't... Deliver really. Some moments were great but as a whole, it feels like safety was key, rather than pushing the game to a true RnM level of risky jokes and concepts to throw at you.That being said, the game did avoid a pitfall of many games like it: relying too heavily on show content, repurposed in a forced manner. Save for a couple, most references were logical and didn't feel like they were too shoehorned in.I was extremely impressed with the Microverse battery minigame, as it worked as a reference, was challenging and at times very manic, and with subtle audio cues and a great visual aspect, it felt the most like something that belonged in a Rick and Morty game. B.S. scifi handwaving with frantic and haphazard reactions to controlling the fate of a plane with mundane knobs and levers for a relatively meaningless taskPast the writing, the gameplay itself is good for some but not all. If you liked Job Sim, you'd like this. It presents tasks similarly but it has more real game elements. The slight puzzles could've been trickier, but the interactable objects did provide a good amount of material to entertain yourself with. When it comes to the shooting segment, this was the most lackluster shooting in a VR game so far. Not a huge part of it, but it didn't feel satisfying whatsoever. The combinstion mechanic was excellent and at times surprising, but did taper off after the first 20 minutes(still an impressive amount of time to spend experimenting with different combos of items)When the portal idea was mentioned, I expected maybe on the upper end of a dozen environments, albeit simple, but the game contains 4 with any real interactivity. All others are mainly set pieces with a mechanic, such as the disc load screen and the phone with a button.Overall I would say it's a worthy VR experience, and I would not say the length hinders it like so many say, rather that the developers and writers did not try to be as ambitious as they could've been, nor would a RnM fan expect. Some improved writing/translation into the format, further environments, and maybe one or two additional mechanics and I would safely say this is one of the best VR games out there, but it sadly fell just a little short of this."
,Not Recommended,469610,31288876,Posted: 21 April,all,dynamicsFiend,"It's an ok game.  Don't expect to go on lots of interesting wacky adventures.  You're mostly just hanging out in Rick's garage fixing stuff.  It feels exactly like a re-skinned Job Simulator.  If it were $10-15 I'd be like yeah give it a try, it's pretty ok.  But $30 is wayyyy too much."
76561198008259826,Recommended,469610,31323607,Posted: 23 April,all,TheDog,"gonna review this from 2 perspectives, from a gamers and from a developers.gamers perspective, yeah, its a bit short for the price and replayability after isn't all that great either. After beating the story I'm pretty much just easter egg/ achievement hunting. The story itself was okay and had a ton of familiar humor from the show, so that was nice. as a fan of the show i did feel like it was great experience to be able to stand next to the characters and interact with them. i didnt run into any bugs in my play through and the art overall looks great, so no complaints there. the puzzles were at times fairly challenging so this game has a healthy balance of difficulty going. everything in general just feels really polished. so to sum it up, a bit short but pretty fun none than less.developers perspective. to clear something up i dont mean i helped develop this in any way, i'm a hobby game developer myself which provides me with some insight on what goes into making a game. so first off, art wise they really did add a ton of stuff into the game, and the fact that you can combine items, then combine those items, and keep going, that is a pretty significant art requirement even for such a ""short"" game. so definately kudos to them. they also nailed the details of the characters when compared to the show, just look at the pupils of morty and you can tell they went into great depths to make it as detailed as possible. again speaking art, the 3d assets are great but then they topped it off with the massive list of 2d art assets as well. all the book covers and what not. all that detail takes up a lot of time so again very impressive and great job. i had no issues playing, no bugs, nothing of that nature so it was a very plished and smooth experience. considering all the short buggy VR experiences out there it is great to see some better quality stuff.now lets talk play time, from a gamers perspective it seemed short BUT from a developers perspective it was pretty awesome. considering that at no point and time did i find myself standing idle, i was constantly busy doing something for an hour and a half straight. to put that in perspective with a traditional game, lets say gta for example. if it werent for the fact that you are constantly traveling great distances the games story itself would be pretty damn short. so to say that this game is too short is simply not giving it justice since it is a VR game that faces locomotion issues. where a traditional game can extend its playtime significantly just by forcing you to travel long distances, which btw more than often people tune out during those periods until they reach their destination, VR is still trying to overcome the struggle of locomotion. so before you judge a VR game by it's length you should be fair and not 1:1 compare it to a traditional game.overall its a great game that uses a great IP. i do recommend to watch the show before you play though otherwise you might miss some of the humor in this game. the show fills in a lot of context that otherwise would just be goofy or down right weird. you can probably still enjoy it without watching though.anyways, wubaduba dub dub~"

My Man!I've finished my first play-through and clocked 1.5 hours, but I still haven't find all the secrets, so I'd say to ""beat"" this game to use terminology such in vogue with the current generation (that uses it without understanding why we old chaps say ""beat"" about a game) it would take 3 hours more or less. But I'm planning to throw my wife - son - friends in here to see their faces when they're thrown in front of Rick Sanchez, yeah!Seriously, it's an insta-buy if you're fan of the series and of the Job Simulator mechanics. Again, kudos to the devs for such a perfect game."

And since noone on Earth in its right mind isn't a fan of it....I bought the game in the last summer sales. Imho 28 € is a bit too much for this, but everything under 20 € is ok imho.I really felt like beeing part of a R&M episode, the moment you have Rick and Morty standing in front of you was really something. The rest of the game is like job simulator, which I haven't played, that might be an advantage, since everything was new to me. I really lilked the puzzle part with the car engine.Technically, I was impressed, how good room-size-play was integrated. No other game did such good use of it. It was very rare I saw the chaperone. The interaction in game with object was also very polished.Btw, still not finished with the game, and I'm already over 1h.

The game is made better if you're a fan of the franchise already. There are quite a few inside jokes that you will definitely get if you're a fan of the franchise, but won't mean anything if you're not. I think regardless of whether or not you've seen the show, the game is entertaining. It's a relatively short game, but longer than a lot of current VR titles with some replay value based on acievments and a few hidden surprises that are a little more difficult to find and the ability to replay chapters."

The ""campaign"" (for lack of a better word) is not supposed to be long, as youre expected to get distracted by all of the stuff you can screw around with. Eat mysterious objects, use a machine to combine alien eyeballs with a copy of your own brain, give Mr. Meeseeks (or as he's called in this game, Mr. Youseeks) weird objects for hands, listen to the voices that pop in your head when you wear the demon helmet.I must've spent an hour alone playing and re-playing ""Troy"", the bootleg ""Roy"" ripoff, in an attempt to live as many different lives as I could.All that said, if there's one disappointment I have with the game, its that you cant make a vibrator by combining the tentacle-shaped ""toy"" with a vibrating toothbrush or electric razor.

Also had a great time watching a friend play through.I can see why someone would be upset about the length, but to me VR experiences aren't just different lengths of rope - the best one isn't necessarily the longest for the lowest cost.  I paid about the same amount for Call of the Star Seed and got about 90 minutes out of it, but didn't feel like that was money well spent for me.

,Recommended,469610,31329745,Posted: 23 April,all,Cap,"As a huge fan of VR and Rick and Morty I was stoked to play this game, and after playing it I can, unsurprisingly, say it is in my opinion the new benchmark of what a great VR game is.I was worried at first that my love for the show would skew my judgement of the actual game apart from the IP it's tied to, so in an attempt to come from a less biased perspective I had one of my friends play the game first, I didn't listen to the audio and I only checked into what he was doing and if he understood what he was supposed to do. I believe that a good VR game should be intuitive to the player, as complex controls can take away from the immersion of the experience. From what he told me and what I saw the game does a good job of keeping its actions simple, with out making it's puzzles or challenges feel condescending.After playing it myself I feel like the the game doesn't overshadow the source material and vice versa, they work well together and the humor of the show's aloof nihilism really comes through in the game play. From the way you respawn after deaths to the ultimate goal of the game, and thus your life as the character, you understand how the writers care a lot about not caring about anything.Another positive I'll give the game is having it's more gratuitous references be more than just references. For example one of the more creatives mechanics is the Youseeks. In the game you can only exist in your playspace which can be in one of three places of the main setting, Rick's garage. This leaves a lot of space impossible to enter and items out of the reach of your creepy floating hands. The game works around this by giving you this Pokeball like device that you can toss anywhere and spawn a Meeseeks that is, like the player, just two floating hands and a head, with a vr headset fused to its face called a Youseeks. It mirrors your movements allowing you to access things that would otherwise be out of your reach.This game is joint venture between creators of Job Simulator, Owlchemy Labs, and Just Roilands game studio, Squanchtendo, who made the VR game Accounting. Both of those games are basically the opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of VR game play. Job Simulator is a full sandbox game with environments densely packed with different objects that all seem to have some special action or property, such as staplers that you can shoot staples from like an underwhelming pistol, or a two liter of soda you can shake up and let rocket around the room. But the game is void of any form of narrative, something I dislike despite understanding that it was probably done to drive home the mundane feeling one gets from a nine to five job.Where Accounting is a game that tells a really thought provoking, if not messed up, story that you are at the center of. While the story of the game is full the environments feel empty, mostly to not confuse or distract the player from progressing through the game. It's meant to be a 20-30 minute experience depending on how much you love hearing Justin Roiland squawk nonsense at you, something I am a huge fan of.I feel that Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality strikes a happy medium giving you a good story that showcases the very interactive environment and I would love to see more games follow in this one's footsteps. Build an environment with a toy-box worth of things to play with and then tie in an interesting story that encourages you to have fun with them. The new evolution of the Point and Click adventure game the ironically has no pointing or clicking.  I hope to see more from these two studios both by themselves and together, maybe DLC for this game or perhaps a sequel, though I feel these two studios could probably knock an entirely new IP out of the park.My one complaint is that the story is a bit short, only about two to three hours long, and kind of leaves me wanting more when there is no indication of more coming. But where it lacks in story I feel like it more than makes up in environment and things to do, even if those things are pointless, just like our sad confusing lives.All in all great game, a good buy even if you don't know about Rick and Morty."

So if you think a small amount of bland gameplay is worth $30 then go ahead.I thought the gameplay was going to be more unique, such as portalling around to new worlds and doing actual rick and morty stuff. however it is more of a 'pick stuff up, place it over there' simulator. Nothing new or unique is in this game, and they seemed to have failed to capitalize on what vr can do. To elaborate, one of the things that they missed was creating a 'sense of scale' on alot of moments where it shouldve been there,This looks like a demo  that wouldve been shown before the vive was released a year ago. the job sim people shoulda just made this a $15 dlc.

For anyone concerned that it might get repetitive, like Job Simulator, I can tell you that it absolutely doesn't.  The game keeps you on your toes and is constantly putting you in new situations.Is this a 'must buy' VR game?  Sadly, I'd have to say no.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it and don't regret the purchase at all.  I do think that you need to be a Rick and Morty fan to get much out of it, so I'd suggest to pass or at least wait for a discount if you're not a Rick and Morty fan.  There's a bunch of stuff to do after finishing the game, but it will still probably only end up being a ~3 hour game to do everything.  That may not be enough content for some people, so keep that in mind before buying the game at full price.If you're a huge Rick and Morty fan, definitely go buy it.  You'll have a great time."

I hate to say it, but it's just not that good. It felt like the game was content to just refernce the show and provide menial gameplay. Which is great, for ten minutes.. but then the references are drip-fed. And the gameplay starts to feel more tedious. I quickly became bored. I remeber how much more lively the show was, even the charactors themselves seem like they are done with the game. Here the fun of the show was just getting kinda bogged down in the much slower Job Simulator gameplay.And then they did the thing... THE SIN that is, ""Hey player! isn't it annoying when *thing* happens to you?"" Does *thing* to player (Ironically).That was the straw that broke the camels back, I returned the game. At which point, I realized I was halfway through the game in about 40 minutes... WHAT!! You want me to pay $30 for an hour and a half expirence?If the game was under $20 I would understand.. I wouldn't be happy per se.. But the price point would have been more understandable.All this is to say...Yes this game made me laugh. Yes I was in some kind of nervous awe when I first went into living room where all these adventures had happend. But in the end there just aren't enough references for it to really be a reference game. It can't really stand on it's own in the comedy department.

In this game, you basically play as Morty's clone, who was created by Rick to take on tasks on his behalf. This is like Job Simulator, another game of Owlchemy Lab.There are things to interact with, funny comedic stuffs around and things to experimental with to can entertain you for hours.The main game itself will take roughly 2 hours to complete (provided you didn't get stuck for long), but you wouldn't see everything that the game has to offer if that's the case. There's a part in the game (which I wouldn't spoil) that offer split paths, and if you want to see everything in that segment you will have to replay that part. In total, you will probably take 3 hours or more to complete for first try.The game mainly take place in the garage, with some cases where you will head to other places. In the garage, there are 3 fixed teleportation spot, allowing you to shift to where ever you want. If there's something out of your range, you can just summon a Mr. Meeseeks to take it for you.The game is hilarous and fun, and if you like Job Simulator, you will like this game."

We were soon wrapped up in a complex plot dreamed up by Rick and we, the Morty clones, are caught stuck in the middle saving the world from the confines of Morty's garage.

You're free to explore environments of random toys and devices that have various uses, and lots of little easter eggs.If you've watched Rick and Morty, you'll know the angle of humour involved.It's a pretty cool VR experience, though certainly not for children, regardless of the cartoon nature of it all. The humour is dark and perverse, the game has gore, the language is crude.Fact is, if you're even interested in this game, you're likely already a fan of Rick and Morty, and you probably already know that it's not the kind of game you should let your 7 year old play for any amount of time.As for its appeal for adults? Well, it's exactly what you'd expect of a partnership between the creators of Job Simulator and Rick and Morty. It's a free-for-all sandbox game that only gently nudges you to progress the ""story"". I say story lightly, as it is VERY light on story, and heavier on playing around with the mechanics of free reign in Rick's infamous garage workshop.At its asking price, it might seem pricey for people who expect full games for this price. Personally, I was quite comfortable with the price, as I just wanted to enter the world of Rick and Morty.Frankly, it didn't disappoint."

Want a 'game' that has a story and lasts more than 2 hours? don't buy it.Let's get one thing straight, VR is a new trending technology that may, or may not, kick off in the near future. Due to the lack of games out there, especially AAA games, and the lack of any 'standard' formula for VR games, this is entirely new territory for many developers.The guys here have done a great job at making mundane activities fun and interesting, albeit short lived. It's pointless to complain about the price tag, because there isn't a 'standard' for games on the VR yet, everything is completely experimental and you're paying for mini experiences, rather than games.The humour of Rick and Morty comes across perfectly in this experience and leaves you desperately wanting more. They could easily create a great episodic adventure with this style of gameplay - solving puzzles to proceed the story. Until then, however, you get 'Job Simulator' dressed up as a Rick and Morty game which, actually, isn't a bad thing.Yes, this experience has 2 hours of gameplay max and yes the price tag is steep for the content, but as a Rick and Morty fan, heck as a VR pioneer, it's completely worth it. Tracking is spot on, the use of boundaries and portals works well, and you don't feel 'trapped' even though you don't leave a set number of 'zones'.There's not much new here in terms of innovative gameplay mechanics, instead this is a perfected version of a game that has already been very successful in the VR experience range, 'Job Simulator'. We can only hope they release DLC to include new experiences within the R&M universe."

It's just bad models that are poorly animated. Everything is kind of washed out and bland.- It's really short. REAAALLY short.- There's none of the clever structure or twists you expect from Rick and Morty.Upsides:- There's some funny writing and performances.- There's a ton of little details and nods to the show for fans.- I like that some actual (very light and basic) puzzle solving was added to the Job Simulator formula, it feels a little more like an actual game now (but only barely).I'd probably be stuck thinking, ""... that's it?"" if I'd only paid $10 for it. $30 is just an insane price point for something so basic.

As a big rick and morty fan, i could not recommend this any more. this game made me feel so giddy from start to finish, it was like i was in a 2 hour long rick and morty episode (this game is also great to showcase to friends and family as an intro to VR)"
,Not Recommended,469610,31262165,Posted: 20 April,all,Syrsly,"Not long and not very replayable... but funny... and looks cool.The game lasts just long enough to get you past that max 2 hour refund mark.  It doesn't offer much story, but what little story it has is kinda funny, similar to the humor found in the show.  The animation quality is pretty good when other characters are around, but the physics is jumpy when trying to swipe objects and the player hands only have two states, grasping and flat.  The hands also feel unnatural with the Vive because they're not aligned with the way you hold the Vive wands.  The garage is the only fully explorable environment in the game, and even that only provides the confines of the garage via 3 play areas (and a blocked off 4th area for the whiteboard, which is just another tutorial/guide thing).  The minigames are a little too basic and don't offer enough challenge or interactivity to keep my interests after the initial playthrough.  The locomotion is also limited to teleporting between specific areas and can frustrate people like myself who like having more freedom of movement.  It was hard to complete some tasks in the game because I couldn't reach them or they became stuck.  The U-seeks object is helpful for reaching far away objects but ultimately gets on my nerves and feels counter-intuitive.Overall, this game is like watching an episode of the show with less outlines and more shading and a box strapped to your head.  There are some very cool moments in this game which warrant the experience once it gets cheap, but for how little they're offering you, never pay $29.99 for it.  I know, VR is expensive, but that's no reason to throw away your money for this game.  Keep in mind that I'm saying this after being a huge fan of the show and thinking this may be a good way to wait for season 3. Not so much."

This alone isn't a huge deal, but it shows that little love went into the creation.The real killer is that this is barely even comparable to a single episode of Rick and Morty.

But I certainly wasn't entertained all the way through, You barely even get much Rick or Morty, instead you get to play with some rehashed Job Simulator items.The game takes no time to build a story or otherwise offer a coherent experience, it's just a series of small jobs in a gimmicky environment that can't keep even a huge fan engaged for long. I really expected the game to go to far more environments than just what is shown in the screenshots, but apparently it's purely WYSIWYG.For the price I would have certainly expected a full fledged story with tons of interactions, not a (even weaker) Job Simulator rehash with a few Rick and Morty references built in."

First thing I did was give rick a big hug. Love the collisions with the hands and how they made rick lean into my hug. I finished it in one sitting, 1.5 hours. It was a good length, I was ready for a break  by the end. The story was complete and felt about like an episode. I can't wait to go back and beat my Troy score and find all the easter eggs. Heck! I'll probably replay the story a couple times too.To all those people borderline abusing the refund system to play the entire game for free, you're no better than the scum who pirate games because they 'can't afford it' You realize that the more interest, the more people who purchase, keep and replay this game, the more likely you are to get more than 1.5-2 hours of content? Try to look objectively at what you got. If you were to buy a new release movie, it would be $20 and about 1.5-2 hours without much reason to watch it more than once or twice. This game offers minigames, easter eggs, challenges and other ways to entertain yourself all with the Rick and Morty humor we love in the world we're dying to learn and experience more of.In conclusion, for me, this game was just about the right length. I'm still hungry for more, I'm ready to hop back in and explore deeper. I'm also hoping that we get more content for it. The devs can gladly keep my $30 and I'll stick with the game since I'm not an entitled, scummy Gromflomite who has so little regard for how much time and care went into crafting the single best licensed game I have ever seen. Short it may be, but if you look at it as about 5-6 episodes of the show (without replaying) and consider how long it takes to produce that, it starts to feel reasonable. I just got to live half a season of Rick and Morty in my living room and I totally got my money's worth. Bring on Season 3!!!"

It is good, but not great, and it is too expensive for what you get. It is barely a couple hours, plus some side things. Compared to Justin Roiland's Accounting, which is 30-45 minutes and free, this game fall flat. Or compare it to South Park: The Stick of Truth, which was twice as expensive on release, but had 5 times the content, and was funnier with more original content that didn't seem as recycled from the show.If you have a few friends who are Rick and Morty fans, it might be worth the asking price.

,Recommended,469610,34365285,Posted: 19 August,all,FastLawyer,"This game is difficult to review because of the suggested price.  It definitely is not worth $29.99.  I did get this on sale and will recommend this game just barely, because in the end it was mostly enjoyable.  It definitely could have been better.First thing that comes to mind is that most of the activities are just too tedious.  You have to solve the puzzle exactly like the game wants and while most of them are easy to solve, there's some that are not obviouslike connecting the two guns at the end to fix them.  The battery mini-game is just not fun and you have to do it more than once.  The pet alien also seems like a chore for the most part.There are plenty of good moments, however.  My favorite is the VR game where you can control the story in silly ways.  The alien shoot 'em gallery is okay.  And just playing around and discovering new things hidden around is definitely enjoyable, even dying is fun.As a new Rick & Morty fan, I think the VR game appeal is mostly having a mini-episode within the game.  I just wish the episiode was more fleshed out like in the South Park game.Overall 6/10, but defiinitely wait for a sale or else you'll be disappointed with the amount of content, compare this with Accounting VR (I'm not sure which game is better honestly) and that game is free, you can understand the mixed reviews"

This game fits to your play space, so you don't have to worry about hitting a wall like you might in other games. This feature greatly enhances the immersion. This is the type of game that I bought the vive to play. The fact that there are so few games this polished out right now makes it worth it for me.If a quality 2 hour (more like 3.5 - 4 if you like to explore everything like I do) room scale experience is worth it to you, then buy it. Otherwise wait for a sale.P.S. I see a lot of people complaining about the price vs. game length. I'm sure you've heard the argument that VR is still in the early adopter phase, so everything to do with it will be expensive. Another thing you should consider is the level of polish this game offers. I'm running minumum specs on an RX 480, and I only noticed a few performance drops. They were very minor, and didn't cause too much of a distraction. In addition, the developers pulled off some technically impressive gameplay mechanics. The portals allow you to be in two game environments at once. You can stick your head through the portal and see a completly different game location while still being in the original location. That's sweet! The number of object that can exitst in the game enviroment without a performance hit is also insanly impressive."

Some of them are basically thrown in your face, but others you won't find until you've already been playing for an hour and a half.There's so much to interact with in this game; sure you're only in a - what? - 15 square foot garage, but basically everything you see can do something, or can be combined with something else that will make it do something. And don't get me started on Troy! I played Troy for a good thirty minutes and still kept finding new scenarios.I'd honestly call this more of a highly interactive episode of Rick and Morty than a ""game"", but if you've played any other games by Owlchemy, that's what you should be expecting with this title.

I enjoyed the humor most of the time, and I must admit beinginthe 3D universe that I've watched so much in 2D is pretty cool. But being limited to 3 ""playspaces"" in Ricks' lab, with a few minor exceptions was disappointing.I played the game for around 1.5 hours myself which I just don't think is enough playtime for 27.99€. Sadly this seems to be the case with a lot of VR-titles.I wouldn't even recommend this for die-hard Rick & Morty fans, as I'm a quite big one myself, and still left disappointed. 10-15€ would be a more fair price.Even with the ""free-play"" mode, there is just not enough to do in my opinion."

I was really hoping, for a $30 game, I was gonna get a good long game where I could hangout with these cool dudes and go on adventures. Its pretty much exactly the same thing as the Job Simulator demo with a few bonus features. Id pay $20 but $30 is asking for too much. Ive played the game for 62 minutes so far and Im on the last assignment, thats right assignment. There actually isnt really any interaction with Rick and Morty you just perform some stupid simple tasks that arent that funny for 1 hour. Thats what you get for $30. If you have the money to throw away then the hell with it just buy. If youre like me and money isnt as easy then maybe wait for a steam sale and dont bother avoiding yotube channels becuase there is nothing cool they can spoil. The accounting VR game was hilarious and made by the same people so you would think this game would be that funny. WRONG its not funny in fact Im practically done with it and I havent laughed once.

The object crafting tool is a thing of gamedev nightmares and I was pleasantly surprised with how many cases it covered. In general, the objects all interact in varied and intereting ways with themselves, other objects, you and the gameworld. The shaders are a wonder to behold if you know anything about graphics programming. In general, this is an extremely polished piece of software, I was running slightly below min spec and got smooth results nearly all the time.The content is densely packed fanservice. Lots of shout outs and references to things from the show. Any fan will immediately feel at home in the universe. There's even a canon story addition that you'll have to play to find out. The game makes heavy use of universe-jumping, existential pain, and humor, just like you'd expect.The Job Sim formula wisely trades in linear gameplay time for richness of interaction, and it works especially well here. Not everyone values this setup, but if you go into the experience knowing this you can plan accordingly. Take your time. Explore the environment. This game isn't meant to be speedrun.Definitely worth the price of admission for me."

,Recommended,469610,31277520,Posted: 21 April,all,Cego em Tiroteio,"""VR accounting"" felt more like a genuine Rick and Morty experience with more dialogs and surreal story. It was interesting to follow to the plot and it presented new perspectives.""Virtual Rick-ality"" fells to be more about chores. A Job Simulator with licensed characters. A big branded toy box. Here the dialogs are mostly instructions, excuses for the game mechanics and some mild play with the 7th wall (or whatever wall would be the VR equivalent to the 4th). Plot is very far from a true Rick and Morty (but you get to play Troy - a Roy rip-off).That said, the game is fun. I like how it doesn't shy of making you stretch a bit and explore your environment. A tiny room is so full of possibilities and the permanence of your mess across a playthrough is interesting (I recommend going from start to finish in a single session).Everything is interactive and goes a bit beyond placing/throwing objects at stuff. A falling lightbulb breaks if mishandled, moving the dark matter too fast explodes it. The game has some interesting mechanics with the Meeseeks. One nuisance is the traditional gaming practice of requiring mix of random items to progress (eg: detergent bottle + hammer + pink crystal) instead of reasonable/logic combinations.It's a good short VR game. The only problem is that the show ""Rick and Morty"" sets the bar too high for fast story with social/psicological criticism and the game doesn't have those.It is relatively short, but that's not bad. The game has some mini-games that happen only once on the story. The game doesn't force you replay the same mini-games to exaustion in order to milk hours of aledged gameplay like most games do."

,Not Recommended,469610,31290534,Posted: 21 April,all,ogresav,"I thought it sucked initially but I gave it a chance. I kept expecting something new and cool to happen, kept expecting it to be more than just a simple puzzle or two. But then it got real repetitive. It felt recycled, even as little content as it had. The game revolves around a couple of gadgets in Rick's garage and then you're done, you've beat it. And there's NO replayability, like I don't remember a game I've played before that was this un-replayable. I will delete this from my computer and forget I ever bought it, only regret being the price and time spent on it. Normally that'd be an exaggeration, but I think I literally regret having wasted a couple of hours on this. I feel robbed.I'm a huge fan of the show, and I love VR games. I didn't even have very high expectations - I just thought it'd be neat at least to have some sort of gameplay beyond puzzles. I thought there might be some actual choices you could make. I thought you could explore a little bit... A portal gun! Now there's a thought, maybe I'd get to travel to alien planets??No, no, you have like 4 areas you can go, and for 3 of them you can't move or teleport. In the garage there's 3 locations you can stand. That's it. That's all this game is. It's Stand In Rick's Garage simulator, then teleport about 3 other kind of cool spots where you stand and figure out some stupid puzzle. Now and then you hear something ""funny"" but it feels so light compared to the show. Even the humor feels repetitive and washed out.Hardcore fans, I don't know if you'll like it. You might find it funny at points. It does have it's moments, and I say that reluctantly. If you don't mind burning $30, by all means.But devs, this is a game where you could give the player a portal gun and let them explore alien planets, but what you did was force the player to stand in a garage. I think it's as simple as that in the end.Maybe the Rick and Morty writers didn't give you the effort you needed so you recycled as much episode content as you could. Maybe they didn't understand that a real Rick and Morty game would take about as much content as a season of the show, that they'd need to be recording tons and tons of voice acting and writing about huge areas to look at, and possible things to do. A good game needs completely fresh content - look at South Park's the Stick of Truth. That's all new, all brilliant and hilarious stuff wrapped around a REAL game, an RPG. As simple as it was, it was still a game that had fun elements, and it was full of show references but it didn't revolve around those references like Rick and Morty. That is a cartoon show inspired game the way it's meant to be done.I feel like the whole game design was a short coffee break where they said, ""Okay here's the deal - you're in Rick's garage and there's this device that combines two things... you put a carrot and a metal can in it, and it makes a metal carrot! Then you solve puzzles with it. That's a whole VR game right there."" And then they rolled with it."

Rick will even mock the game's own simplicity at one point.  For the $30 price tag it is a good buy as you do get a fun game with a little bit of replay value but most of that comes out of finding random junk to merge together and making a mess of the garage.  If you have Job Simulator there's pretty much no reason to buy this game as it only a slight upgrade with escape-the-room and puzzler mechanics added on top, Oh, and there's a short FPS level.  I was really hoping to see more of the Rick and Morty universe in VR but sadly it's just a tease.  I'll recommend this if they at least build the rest of the rooms for the house and add some gameplay for each one but right now this feels like an extended demo to a full experience.  Buy it if you like to simply mess around with random junk in vr but if you were hoping to go on a Rick and Morty adventure then you will literally be made fun of.  Also, come on Owlchemy!  Picking up objects in VR is amazing but not a gameplay mechanic you can just reuse as the primary selling point.  It’s nostalgic at best. Despite its failure to sway me as being a valid Rick and Morty game, it all seems intentional if you watch the first store page video!  So I don't recommend this as a Rick and Morty Game, and not even as a Game Game, but maybe I can as a Game Game Game."

(it does ""levitate"" things off the floor for you but not up high enough with how close to my desk I have to play) Not 100% the game's fault, just it should be known in the requirements that you really do need around a 8'x8' minimum area to play this.While it is fun and interesting for $30 and with trouble i had picking things up off the floor I can't really recommend it, but maybe on steam sale, if you have a large room to play in, pick it up for $10 or so!"

It's got a few fun mechanics that I haven't seen in other games, such as the Youseeks (but that might be because I'm still relatively new to VR), and many of the mechanics are very similar to Job Simulator.  I suppose you could think of this as an amped-up Rick and Morty mod for Job Simulator.  It takes an hour or two to get through all of the main content, depending on how much you mess around, and it has some collectables and secrets to find all the way through the game.Overall, I think it's a lot of fun for anyone who loves Rick and Morty and Job Simulator-esque games, but is a little pricy at $29.99.

Except for a couple of times, I did not find myself laughing. Accounting, while shorter than this title, was a lot more fun.Also, except for Rick and Morty you won't find many characters in here.It's just like job simulatorThe whole game follows the same structure of job simulator: Someone (Rick) gives you a task, You execute the task, repeat. It gets boring and keeps you hoping that something interesting will happen (It doesn't for the most part).This is Rick and Morty, I want to go on adventures! Instead, the only locations you will see are The garage, a Satellite, a Weird planet (that you can't explore) and the Bathroom.It's shortThis game is 30$ for 90 minutes (maybe less) of ""story"". Yes, you can freeplay, but the replayability it's not really there unless you're an achievement hunter.TroyThis is actually the only part of the game that I liked. Troy is the ""crappy version"" of Roy (the game seen in the series).It has some replayability value, but it gets stale after a couple of playthrough.RecapWhile this game can keep you entertained for an hour or so it lacks Rick and Morty ""spirit"" and humour.At this price it's definitely not worth it."

They brought a level of crazy detail and humor that's a perfect match for the insane Rick & Morty universe. Most of the game takes place in Rick's garage, where you, as  Morty VR clone, do what you're told. You'll do Rick's laundry, order him parts online, recharge his batteries, and a wealth of other, light, puzzle-like tasks. All the while you'll be berated by both Rick and Morty as you slog through the labors.It's only downside is being rather short at about 2 hours, and only having a handful of different locations, even if they ARE stocked with lots of content. The DNA of 'Job Simulator' can be felt here, including the vomiting mechanic when eating bad food, and the 'exit burrito'.But that's all just nitpicking -- no regrets at all.Hoping we'll see some DLC for this!Part puzzler, and part sandbox -- just, please, clean your plumbus after using it, you disgusting prick."

It took me about an hour and a half to play through, taking my time exploring and trying things out. I unlocked half of the collectibles while doing so.Yes, this game is purely for Rick and Morty fans. If you don't like the show, you probably won't enjoy this either. The game is filled to the brim with references to the episodes which, in my opinion, is a huge part of what makes this a very enjoyable experience. After all, this is for the fans.It plays very much like Job Simulator (same devs), but follows a story. The story of you, a Morty clone, whose sole purpose is to obey Rick. I won't go into any story details to keep this as spoiler free as possible. All I will say is, it is ofcourse a very Rick-and-Morty-esque litttle story in which you play an integral part.There are a handfull of mini-games you'll encounter during the story which can be played again for high-scores/collectibles upon completion of the campaign. There are loads of little secrets, easter eggs and who knows what else to discover.The only thing I would've liked to see is some more characters like Mr, Poopy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Snowball, some Aliens, Mr. Meeseeks, etc. The only characters here are Rick & Morty with Summer making a brief appearance and Jerry (who can only be heard, not seen, somewhere). Don't be fooled, the blue guys you see in the screenshots and video's aren't real Mr. Meeseeks.Nonetheless, I won't complain about the amount of content found here and thought the length was perfect for completing the game in one go. There are games that offer a far less polished, less original experience with less content for about the same price."

Failing to account for this soon found us hitting our controllers against walls (when throwing things) or finding in-game objects were out of reach when we were trying to interact with them.For fans of the show, there's plenty of replayability in Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality.

It would have been really easy to create a quest where you have to dig out morty form the backyard, get a beer for rick from the kitchen, go into the kroenenberg universe to retrieve something which would have been mostly retexturing of the assets. Instead they opted to let the game play out almost entirely in ricks garage. With the exception of 3 alternate places with very small parts in the story. Olchemy labs showed great potential as a developer by a year after the release of Job Simulator they have not evolved.

All the dialog feels like it was recorded in one day and I cant recall one joke that even made me smile (Which is  really what Rick and Morty is all about).This game had a huge opportunity to use the portal gun for locomotion but completely missed the mark and only implements the portal tech as a machine that auto makes portals in one spot only (with very limited use).You can tell there is something wrong with this game by just looking at the steam discussions. Nearly ever thread is locked and who knows how many are deleted.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

However, after playing the hour and a half story(ignore idle playtime), I can definitely say the game had some great moments and made me laugh a couple times, but ultimately, left a sour taste in my mouth. As far as the jokes go, there's nothing ground-breaking or super memorable from the game. There's equal amounts of crass and intelligent humor on display in both the VR game and the TV show, but the game doubles down on the latter and lacks the good humor fans have come to know almost entirely. At some points(avoiding spoilers since the game is short anyways), you have no idea to what to do, and it can become really frustrating really quickly when characters repeat themselves or give no helpful clues. I will say, that the graphical presentation and easter eggs are on-point. However, it's hard to recommend even as a huge Rick and Morty fan, unless you really want something to tide you over until Season 3. If you're not a Rick and Morty fan, there's nothing here that's going to change that(and Job Simulator would most likely be the better bet).

,Recommended,469610,31259848,Posted: 20 April,all,Lurkz,"Funny, but brief. If you buy this then take your time and savour the experience as it will be over before you know it. Some of the mechanics could have been used for so many more tasks, the merge one especially. When I saw that I thought the game would have huge depth, but alas it doth not.Was great to see and hear Rick and Morty in VR though, some funny jokes and scenes. Just feel there wasn't enough of it. Still recommended as it's very entertaining."

Will def get my friends around over the weekend so they can experience it and will try find all the cassettes.Also go vegan Morty!10/10 would recommend.Also it was cool to be in their world. The death scenes was fun too."

There's a lot to experiment with, and it has a calm and hilarious atmosphere.

So, there is that...as I see most of the complaints are around the amount of content and the cost. I'm about an hour in, and so far the game is clever mash up of ""Accounting"" (Free download... get it if you haven't already) and ""Job Simulator"".  Add Rick cursing, Morty whining and some space ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  A very good use of room scale and environment movement and teleporting is smooth, object handling good."

Great game. completed the game in about 1.5 hours but not really considering there is alot of things needed to do to complete achivements and it does have some replayability. Still worth the money. Some glitches that im sure will be fixed and im hoping maybe for more content for free down the road?!?!? If not dont let that hold you back from picking up this game. WE NEED SEASON 3 GAWD!!!!! I wish some things did more things but for a VR Game im glad the creaters of job simulator where part of this game. Alot of similarities between the two and by that I mean they solved alot of problems and make the game fun. Some tasks are challenging and really make you think some actually had me looking at my watch for more clues but none where given so not for anyone 12 or under for sure.
76561198097422183,Recommended,469610,31262439,Posted: 20 April,all,Rednas,"This game is fun and the humor is good. It has the same humor as a normal episode has, and thats great.But for the same price as Job Simulator i cant not feel like they could have done more. There is alot of things to interact with.But even with the huge amount of items you can interact with you start to see a clear pattern that its copy paste but with another model.Is the game fun? Yes. You will have alot of fun and enjoy your time. The writing is on point.But is it worth the money? No. Not when there is many games that does the same for the same price but more to do aswell.Get another game unless this is on a sale or they add more content"

You really feel like you're in the R&M universe, and subject to the absurd humor that reigns there. There is too little content considering the price you're paying (I ""completed"" the game in 80 minutes, enjoying each second,) but the game is highly recommended even so."

,Recommended,469610,31739644,Posted: 13 May,all,Pumpkin Bob,"First the nitty gritty:I would say buy this if you are a fan of the show or job simulator. Maybe check out a few minutes online first if you aren't sure if you are either one of those things and if you hate them both this isn't going to change that. This is about 2 hours long for a straight through run, it shares a clear lineage with accounting and job simulator and it carries a bit of the VR price premium.That all said, I really enjoyed it. I really like the show and this has the feel of being a part of a caper in that universe with some puzzles thrown in. As for the VR price premium I mentioned before, VR is in the early days still and at 600-800 a headset it isn't for everyone. The install base needs to grow and while it does the people making this stuff need to eat. To me it is worth it to support quality stuff for a bit more than you might normally pay for a standard game like this. You have to ask yourself if it is worth it to you to have different content than wave shooters; for me it is a simple yes. Also if I go to see a 2 hour movie with my wife I pay more than 30 easy, so the value proposition for both of us and friends that come over from time to time is met pretty easily."

However, I wish and hope that this is the beginning and that we can either get DLC or possibly the ability to add community content.I really hope that more stories could be added. The assets exist, keep adding to this. I thnk it can go much further than job simulator, just on the IP alone.I would recommend this to anyone that watches the show. You just have to do it for what you learn about someone and I guess is now cannon. Otherwise, it is ok, but not for the money if you do not care about the Rick and Morty show."

One of my first VR titles.Pros:Come on you are a Morty Clone!Teleportation is well done.Controls are slick and responsive.No Motion Sickness for me.Voice Acting is great.Tons of things to try and find after the game is over.Cons:Well you can beat it in 2 hours.Sometimes things are hard to reach and Mr. Youseeks can be hard to work with.Lots of throwing things but throwing is a bit ""soft""?Way too short.  The VR Tax on this one is about 100%Overall I would definitely recommend this to people who love the show.If you just like the show (don't love it) or even dislike it then I would avoid this and just get Job Simulator as this really is for Rick and Morty Fans."
