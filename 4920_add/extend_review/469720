,Recommended,469720,33333889,Posted: 6 July,all,BlueOrange,"Recommended for: People who love evaluating which piece of equipment is better, and would love a turn-based Diablo.This is essentially a less depressing (and somewhat less pretty) Darkest Dungeon.  Recruit your people, go into dungeons, kill stuff, rinse, repeat.The equipment system is Diablo-style item generation, complete with equipment sets.  Death penalties are light; return to your home base and everybody gets resurrected at no cost.Pacing is a bit slow, production values are a bit cheap.  At this price point, you'd probably be looking for more."
76561198044079629,Recommended,469720,33330201,Posted: 6 July,all,spork_lift,"Can't really write a full review yet, but I thought I might as well put something here since there seem to be no other reviews yet.If you're not familiar with Monsters' Den, it's an old-school dungeon crawler where your party of 4 faces off against groups of anywhere from 1-6 enemys in combats to traverse the dungeon. Nothing too innovative, but I do really enjoy the row based combat, and the action clock is a nicely done system in general.Performance:Game runs fairly well. Occasionally slightly frame drops/slows down during combat animations, but apart from that, no complaints. Fairly bug free so far.Interface:Not the best, so far, but it works, which is the important thing. It feels a little clunky, but maybe I'll get used to it.Gameplay:I'll update this as I play more. Seems to be standard Monsters' Den fare so far, but which more room for character creation/custimization, which is a big plus. Also seems to be something of a resource managment/castle building element, which should be interesting.For now, that's really all I can write for the review. The game runs, and from the first dungeon, seems like it will be a solid Monsters' Den entry. I'm fairly certain this franchise has been created by one developer, so I'd reccomend you support him and drop 13.50 on this game. If you like dungeon crawlers, it's probably worth it.Update 1: After putting some time into the game, I've noticed a few things. Firstly, the pacing seems a little slow. It feels like I'm using the same strategies pretty often without getting too many new options to choose from. That being said, it feels like this is the sort of game that really hits its stride mid to late game. With the variety of equipment, and slots for multiple parties, it feels like the player would probably be changing equipment and teams to suit the enimies they'd be fighting, but I haven't hit that point yet. In addition, the Dev seems to be actively fixing bugs and has already pushed a couple patches, so no complaints there."
,Recommended,469720,33362882,Posted: 7 July,all,Carlz0r,"Wow, I'm really impressed with this game so far.  Bought it, and played over 4 and a half hours in one evening.  I just wanted to leave some impressions for now.First of all, this isn't a hardcore/permadeath game.  I'm mentioning that first for two reasons:1. A lot of people hate those kinds of games.2. Some roguelike fans might look at this game, and expect permadeath.Although the developer has indicated that there may be a hardcore mode added in the future.. for now, that is not the case.Without explaining the whole game at length, especially since there are still some of the game's mechanics that I have not been able to try yet, I will try to give a vague impression of what to expect.-Battling is similar to Darkest Dungeon, but different.  Instead of a single-file line, you have 3 front-row slots, and 3 back-row slots, and so do the enemies.  It's still turn-based, and positioning is still important.. some character classes get abilities that can be used to reposition yourself, or even your enemies, on the battlefield.  Some attacks affect adjacent enemies, or all enemies within melee range, so position plays an important role in combat.-The overworld is similar to Battle Brothers, Mount and Blade.  You can encounter events occasionally on it (would actually like to see more of that), but mainly you will use it to move between your keep, various cities, settlements, and quest areas.  You also interact with the towns in similar ways, each one opening up a menu allowing you to visit various factions to turn in special items for reputation bonuses, shop, get quests, etc.-Loot is similar to Diablo.. items can get various prefixes and such that add bonus effects to them.. there are even set items that impart extra bonuses for finding and equipping more pieces.  Not much more to say here, just expect to find lots of loot, and spending some time deciding what you want to use.  The game's interface is good at giving you an idea of whether something you're looking at is better than what the currently selected character has equipped.. but sometimes I think the game's advice in that department is flat-out wrong, so it's always worth taking a look before replacing something nice.On top of all of that, you get to manage and upgrade a keep, participate in story missions, and also embark on random quests at your leisure.  The dungeons are all procedurally generated, and the loot is always random.  At some point in the game that I haven't reached yet, you get to have multiple parties, and I believe you can send your inactive parties off to do their own thing while you adventure.  Pretty cool stuff that I can't wait to try.Anyway, if you want a vague idea of what the battling and dungeon crawling is like, try the previous game, Book of Dread, for free on Kongregate.   It's not exactly the same, but will give you a similar idea to what those parts of the game are like.. however, Book of Dread doesn't include the overworld and keep management elements that are in Godfall..  It's a much more barebones experience.  This is a big upgrade to the series, and I like it a lot.  I highly recommend trying this game.Any downsides?  Sure, I can think of two.First, I noticed that when I was playing for the first time and had the game open for like 3 hours straight, or perhaps it happens when it's been alt-tabbed a few times, I can't tell which, I start to notice some stuttering and slowdown.  The game is pretty efficient to start up, so I was able to save, close, and restart really quick to fix the issue.Second, I would like to see a tooltip for the statistics when you're on the character screen to level up.. just a quick reminder of what aspects of the character are affected by that stat.  Book of Dread had this, so I'd have liked to see the same here."
,Not Recommended,469720,33441008,Posted: 10 July,all,Gerex,"6/10. The game is rather undercooked, it could've used a bit more development. The potential for a good game is there, but it is muddled by extreme repetitiveness. I was holding out, hoping the game would reveal its potential later in the game, but it didn't. What you do in the first few hours, you will be doing the entire game. You're still stuck with 4 party members fighting a bunch of enemies.  Which is a shame, because the array of abilities could support a good and challenging tactics game. But as it stands, most abilities just do the same thing. I wish the game played with passive enemy auras and resistances a lot more.But why am I rating this as a 'not-recommended' when to score is leaning towards the positive? Well, the bugs. This game is pretty damn buggy. Nothing game-breaking most of the time, but annoying nevertheless. Flickering items descriptions,  weird interface bugs and so on.If you're desperate for some turn based strategy, you can probably get some enjoyment out of it. Maybe wait til it's on sale and/or is patched up a bit before purchase."

76561198038795239,Not Recommended,469720,33455253,Posted: 11 July,all,heathkun,"Damn.  Let me get out of the way that I recommend the game if and only if you were a fan of the original.Performance and bugs:Ultimately, I can't recommend this game for the majority of folks.  I'm quite a few hours invested in the game and I can't bring myself to finish it.   The truth is the bugs are a real problem.  The developer has done a lot to fix the major one quickly.  So major, in fact, that people couldn't progress in the game after about 10 minutes of play.   I still from time to time get stick in the same type problem and have to reload.   I also occassionally get crashes in full screen mode.  And perhaps most annoyingly, I do a lot of multitasking while gaming.  I'll get a ""game lost application context"" and have to shut it down whenever I start up certain other programs at the same time.  First time I've ever seen that one.There's also countless irregularities that affect gameplay.  Like chance to hit on UI being nowhere near what it claims to be.  If your chance to miss is low, like 1% you might not notice, but once it's 50% chance to hit you actually hit about 10% of the time.  Very annoying and I can't figure out what or why this happens.gameplay:This one is the most disappointing for me.  For every step forward, trying to bring this game into an actual world and not just an endless dungeon crawl, there's two steps backwards.   I feel like it lost the magic of the original in a lot of ways.  Even now I'm tempted to just go back and play the old Monsters' Den game.Party balance is really off.  You might not notice it if you just go with your standard party, it seems to be built around this, but you'll find some classes just useless and others godlike.  You can easily run 3 and maybe 4 archers and do all content without ever worrying.  This can be fixed in patching, fine.  At the pace the game was developed I'm very concerned when the patches will come and if it will ever be right.World balance and looting...it's just all off. How you spend your time isn't rewarded even close to right.   You can go grind for hours and get a few good items, or you can just spam search ruins on the world map and get maybe 10 in 1 hour without much effort.   Stuff like that.The original classes were simple enough.  I'd like to have seen it expanded on, but the new systems are just not my cup of tea.  And maybe not yours either.  My primary complaint is the masteries.  You get to the end of a skill tree and it locks you out of the other skill tree you have, kinda.  You keep any abilities you've invested in before going into mastery.   I can live with that even though it's sort of strange.  What I hate, though, is the mastery itself gives you no information or hints about what it might offer in return.  The decision you are making is completely on the name of the class.  Then you have to randomly get lucky enough to find rare tomes to give you abilities for that mastery.   No way to know what they abilities are going to be.    Not even searching the forums gets you there.  Really annoying if you like to carefully plan your team.I could go on and on about lackluster features, but the truth is everything but the original core mechanics of explore and loot is worse.   All of the added extras are so underwhelming.   You get a keep to upgrade in various ways, it's cool, but it doesn't feel like it adds anything.  You can manage multiple parties but they just give you a little gold, or rep every month.   Reality is it's still optimal just to use one party.   And the economics around expanding the teams don't make sense -- you have to pay so much in precious resources to slowly farm more resources with the teams.The only addition from the keeps I really like is the relics.   It's quite fun finding and using relics.The last thing I want to touch on is the combat system.  It's almost the same, but maybe a slight downgrade from the old original monsters' den.   It uses turn based for affects now that manifests is weird ways.   It just doesn't feel as sophisticated as the original.  But for the most part, it's the same.I know this is sort of rambling at this point.  I'm not very good at reviews, but I wanted to warn others who might feel the same as me to think carefully about the purchase.  This game has an endless number of fans who will defend it no matter what the reality is, but if I were giving it a generic rating it would honestly -- as a HUGE fan -- be slightly below average.   I'll revise the recommendation after it's patched a few more times.  I'm hoping patches are forthcoming that improve the game, because I truly love the franchise."

76561198029904609,Not Recommended,469720,33841161,Posted: 27 July,all,bear_storm,"At first, Monsters' Den: Godfall seemed alluring in its promise. It's a turn-based RPG with base-building elements and a slathering of subsystems. It's got a real solid set up for its game world, one in which the various deities of its Grayhawk-y pantheon have all been killed off except for the goddess of revenge, and its promise of customization in party makeup and skill loadout is appealing.Unfortunately, Monsters' Den's biggest problem is probably its biggest asset as a Kongregate title: it is really, really same-y and boring. If you want a timekill that will require minimal conscious thought, Monsters' Den will put you in a zen-like state of RPG clicking. On Normal difficulty, single ability spam with the stock party that the game assigns you right out of the gate (in my case, complete with a fighter named Chad) is enough to surmount all mobs, once you've figured out what order to target them in. To compensate for that, (slightly) tougher enemies are damage sponges. Combats drag.I'm not sure if I ever lost a fight, and I deliberately challenged dungeons outside of my level bracket in an attempt to see if there was any cool peripheral stuff outside of the main plot. There are sidequests with plotlines and occasional sites of interest on the world map, but like the rest of the game, they're not very interesting.The core plotline, after its righteously awesome setting fails to deliver any further information or worldbuilding, is a bit tedious. Mostly you stand in the presence of people that the designers want you to know are really important and listen to them panic about cosmic things, waiting for the inevitable instructions to go to a dungeon or kill an extraversal being.If you want immersion, check out Darkest Dungeon. If you want tactical crunch, there are oodles of other games on Steam. If you want narrative development that engages your characters as principal actors, rather than slightly awkward bystanders, most other RPGs have this down.What Godfall is good for is spacing out while staring at your screen, clicking idly, and paying more attention to the podcast you're listening to than the game itself. It's not objectively bad, especially if what you want is a timekill, but every aspect of the game feels just...kind of flat."
76561198026631498,Recommended,469720,33403674,Posted: 9 July,all,ProphetSword,"I've played Monster's Den games prior to my purchase.  I bought Monster's Den: Book of Dread for my Steam Library after I played the online flash game several years ago.  Thought it was a great game.Monster's Den: Godfall, on the other hand, is better than great.  It is addictive.  It takes the formula of Monster's Den: Book of Dread and ramps it up with better graphics, deeper gameplay and an amazing immersive feeling that makes you want to keep playing.  There's always just one more battle to fight, just one more treasure to loot and one more dungeon to explore. It's hard to pass on the random encounters as you travel; because they are unique and interesting.Sure, I've only played for 4 hours at the time of this review, but I can already see that this will be my new passion for a while.In comparison, I recently bought the game ""Darkest Dungeon,"" expecting to be completely sucked into it.  Instead, I was disappointed.  I figured I wouldn't find anything to scratch the itch I wanted ""Darkest Dungeon"" to fill.  But, out of nowhere, this game does it...and does it far better than I would have imagined.I can't recommend this game enough.  If you like building your own parties, fighting tactical battles and exploring dungeons, this is the game for you.  You won't be disappointed with your purchase."

After the first dungeon you can ensure you never encounter real danger again by being careful. Meanwhile, in the first dungeon Cutthroats are so ridiculously, utterly, stupidly broken that I struggle to believe this was a pre-balanced pen and paper game. Throughout my game so far (Lvl 8 and bored) Rangers are the best healers and the best DPS. And they get summons to tank for them. I normally don't rant about balance but when a game makes 2.5 classes feel pointless I lose interest.I also have a bug where it 'loses connerction to the device' whenever I leave it alone for a few minutes. Annoying.None the less I will give it a thumbs up for my 6 or so hours of entertainment, still reasonable value.Best loot system. Ever."

Battles start off fairly easy but as you move on to higher tier assignments you will have to start paying attention to your gear, stats and skill composition. You're free to level and upgrade your party members any way you see fit (want to pump your wizard with strength and endurance and send them to the front lines? - go right ahead). I have not encountered any bugs so far and game itself does not require much from a PC.  Don't expect a deep, branching storyline on the level of Baldur's Gate or Torment and just take the game for what it is - fun and engaging dungeon hunting for glorious loot and exp, with some keep management and story thrown into the mix. Definitely worth the price."
,Not Recommended,469720,33389146,Posted: 8 July,all,Othello,"This game has a lot of issues considering what it is. I'll start this off with a brief summary of my impression of the game:""I'd rather be playing Darkest Dungeon...""I was a fan of Monsters' Den several years ago on Kongregate. I don't remember much of the games, but I know I spent a lot of time in them. After looking at brief gameplay sessions of this latest release, I wasn't particularly impressed. Nonetheless I wanted to give it a shot since I enjoyed its predessesors quite a bit.Needless to say, I wasn't happy with this title.It's boring, there's a lot of downtime on the overworld. The statistics in this game aren't fun to play with, the Hero variety is terrible, the lack of depth within the items and skill trees is disappointing and leaves you with wanting more - the amount of upgrades available to your keep are minimal, the reputation system seems forced / pointless, the graphical quality, sound design, and character design are all bland and outdated, there are performance issues even on high end machines, and nothing in this game screams for me to continue playing it.The gameplay remains to be completely identical to the previous titles which is unfortunate because since the original Monster Dens have released, newer and better games have come along to essentially provide a much more meaningful and enjoyable experience (namely Darkest Dungeon.)And I don't exhaggerate with the Darkest Dungeon comparison - there's a lot to be made here. And considering this game is going for $15, there's just too many things wrong with it to ever warrant that price.Maybe, I'm missing something, something that's hidden after dozens of hours of playing the game - but if a game fails to hook you within the first 2 hours, then it's failed its job."

This is the formula the game is going for. It does it very well but scaling is an issue. At the start of the game, every fight was a brutal one for me. I had to carefully pick my targets and watch the enemies closely to see what they would do; at later levels, this is no longer the case. With Epic-legendary gear and a tank with 500-600 hp and all the ""Hey, look at me"" gear, it's pretty much just click click boom... oh *heal* and done. There are some annoyingly evasion enemies and some dungeons have nice environmental debuffs to bring some challenge but all in all, late game is to easy. Loot is randomly generated and it takes a long time to get the gear your looking for, unless you spam the shops.I highly recommend this game if you enjoy building extremely powerful elite characters from punny sacks of blood.Some things I dislike:4 party member cap on 6 player battles. Assuming this is to make it more difficult and to allow quest npcs to join you.Too few classesToo few skillsToo easy late gameAudio... at around 3 hours in, I started playing the game on mute...Some things I feel were missed:Animations on battlers would add to immersion (just make the sprites grow and shrink (breath) for instance)Traps, enviromental hazards, secrets etc for dungeonsMore puzzles and lore based secretsKeep upgrade are just a tack-on.

Expands on the fundamental game mechanics (skill trees, hiring different classes instead of selecting 4 you are stuck with), strengthens the core gameplay (combat itself is different), and gives you more options on how to play (there is now a world map with different options other than just going into a dungeon)!Most sequels fail to do this in my opinion, and only change, rather than actually improve game mechanics while neglecting everything else."

Open world game is poorly executed. To me it felt like a waste of time and the reputation system is bad. All you need to do is to hire more teams and let them farm reputation for 2 months and you will have full reps for all factions. Should i mention that some high level reputation level item gives the same rep as the low level item? Numbers are terrible and should be adjusted.4. Masteries are so bad, its incredible that they were shipped out in this state.This game felt like remastered version of chronicles which you can play for free. I regret buying this game and I wont recommend it to anyone, this is a bad game."

(Played on veteran difficulty: 125% hp and 125% damage boost for foes)Cons:-The game is still buggy and unbalanced. The bugs sometimes are what cause the balance issues. (some skills are currently OP, others are more or less pointless.)-It is not an easy game. The boss fights in particular are the biggest problems you will face.-The pacing is slow, and everything takes time to progress.-It gets repetitive. There just aren't enough monsters, and events.Pros:-It's a sadistic sort of fun (imagine dark souls)-The feeling when you beat the unkillable boss is amazing.-Tons of items that can be used differently. (Allowing for multiple types of playstyles)-Interesting story and lore.-Dev is bug fixing like a madman.Final verdict.I recommend the game for people who loved the other monsters den games, but I doubt a general audience would put up with the bugs, and nigh unfair difficulty at the moment."

Does feel a little grind at times when crawling through the dangeons, but it does feel good clearing a level, since monsters are ruthless and will punish you if don;t pay attention on their stats.

This is probably the  buggiest game I've seen since Eador, and that's saying something! More of an open beta really.It's a big shame for the Dev. to have released it at this state because all the negative reviews will likely never be corrected after the bugs are corrected, and what is a really fun game would have real♥♥♥♥♥♥scores and nobody would get it.But the dev seems dedicated and quick. An issue raised one day was solved the next day, from what I've seen.  So... At your own peril and with plenty of autosaves.And when a game is really fun, bugs don't matter so much. A non-fun game with zero bugs will still go in your trash library, while the fun buggy one won't.In this game you manage several groups of 4 adventurers doing adventures with turn based combat (not full movement freedom, it's a row-based system which I like a lot less, but it's very well done. Much better than other such games in recent history), the finances of your fort (a feature which could be a bit more in depth), and go through a whole interesting and (so far) well written plot.Real fun.

There is lots to do within the game and plenty of loot. Reading other reviews this has been compared to Diablo only turned base.  I really can't say that whole heartly but everyone is entitled to thier opinions.There are a few graphic glictches, I have heard the complaints about 30FPS, this game is not a ARPG so really does not need the higher frame rates.  There is a bit of flickering when mouseing over things which is annoying when you are trying to read what the item is or does.  The intitiative portraits are not quite on the screen but over all small things really, a few patches and that will solve that.The game is fun, most of the time, but on occasion an encounter will leave you scratching your head the one I had was the endless waves of cat winged creatures. Which eventually took its toll on my party.  I would recommend this game, however rating wise 7/10  at best.  Worth the 15$, that it costs I think and if I can get 20 - 30 hours I will be happy."

Yea, you can intentionally game the system and make it really easy even on the most difficult setting. Yea, I've had ONE side quest be bugged to where I couldn't finish it and had to abandon it. Yea, some of the stats seem a little wonky sometimes.No, the game shouldn't be called beta. Way more than half the games on Steam have thousands of times the amount of game breaking bugs as this...because this simply doesn't have any game breaking bugs. It has little nit picky♥♥♥♥♥♥and some bad mechanics here and there. Nothing that makes it unplayable. In full disclosure; it did have a resolution issue on day 1 which was very quickly resolved and it had another issue with certain main quest encounters not letting you try again if you died which was also resolved literally minutes after I made a post about it.If you just play the game and don't purposefully break it, it's fun. If you report bugs, the dev listens. If you like these kinds of games and don't look up spoiler ez mode tips, you'll have fun.There's also no terribly long 2 hour sucking tutorial or overly complicated anything...so set a timer on your phone and give it a shot. It's worth the money in my opinion. I've gotten a lot of hours out of it and will probably keep playing it a while longer (only about to complete legend and start up extreme, I've been going one difficulty at a time starting at normal and I've logged 65 hours at the time of this post)..and most likely will circle back to it to check out updates as they come.I did not play any other Monsters' Den games either.
