There are few unlockable characters. Level desings are iteresting and weird at the same time. There are a few fps drops but they only occur after you lose so it's not a big problem and I hope it will be fixed soon.  And I forgot to mention there are Boss fights!Overall I'd give this game 8/10. Maybe some futures updates to add something new."

There’s nothing different about it, it’s pretty fun with some some catchy music and some nice themes going on. This review won’t be long since there isn’t much to talk about with this type of game, you can just see the video below which is self-explanatory how this game is. It’s a very simple game but its too addictive at the same time.Gameplay is straight forward, you’re constantly moving and holding the mouse button will make you fly up and if you let go of the button you descend down and if you end up at the bottom of the screen, you die. There’s stuff flying everywhere including birds, bees, ice cubes(what?), snow balls, comets, rocks etc. There’s boss fights too where a boos would appear and throw things at you and you have to dodge them. There are coins too which you can collect as well as some power pickups like a magnet which will collect coins even if you don’t go through them. The other power-up is a shield which makes you invulnerable for a short time and anything you touch will die.Every time you start a game there’s a different theme every time. Some these include Egyptian theme, Space theme, Winter snowing theme etc. Other than that you can unlock new characters such as Santa pug, Sombrero wearing pug, a panda, a dragon, a hamster etc.The sound in this game is so cute and especially the different themes’ music sound really relevant to their themes.Conclusion: Cute game, cute music, addictive gameplay and only 99 cents (as of this review it’s 40% off and 59 cents), it’s a bargain. Even if you play 2 hours, it’s worth it.Gameplay video below:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682548308"

And besides raw gameplay, there are also some collectibles and unlockable characters.It would be a pretty decent mobile game. I don't see why anyone would want to play it on PC, but if you don't mind doing so, and like this type of games, I don't see why not."

Not gonna ask how are the pugs flying. Still good.The game is great, and it gives you a lot more freedom and content than the first game.I can't say that there's not enough content, since the game was released 9 days ago, so I don't expect a game full of content, but I still hope the game gets updated.In my opinion, this game is harder than the first one, sure, it gives you more space to move, but there's more obstacles and patters almost impossible to do.Getting the pugs and items it's pretty fun, though.So.ProsThere's pugs. Lots of pugs to get. Needs more. More pugs.Nice power-ups to pick and make the game a bit less impossible.4 nice different biomes: Snowy, Grassy, Sandy and Space biomes.Good soundtrack, my favorite song is Space Sprint.ConsNot much content???????Hard as ♥♥♥♥.Both soundtrack and gameplay get really repetitive after a while.It doesn't tell you how many coins you need to get a character, so you have to pick up some coins and then be sad because you didn't get the pug with the mexican hat.by the way i love the mexican hat pug thank you guys so much i love you9/10.Needs more pugs."

No other game can compare to the months, if not years, that the developers spent slaving at their computers coding this masterpeice. This game should not be on steam.  It should be on its own platform where only games with such artistic talent and amazing game play such as this masterpiece.

My favorite is the space soundtrack.Pro: UnlockablesYou can unlock 8 different characters total, and you can get these little snow globe achivement things. Alright unlockables for the price.Con: GameplayThe gameplay is only fun for the first 30-60 minutes. Then it gets a little boring after a while as it's the same thing over and over again.Pro: Boss FightsBosses you run into are unique and I find them good to play against.Conclusion:As the gameplay is the most important part, and this gameplay doesn't hold up too well.

If you identify as ""quirky"" or ""cooky"" this may very well be the very, very basic game you're looking for.I was hesitant to write this review primarily due to the aversion of being labelled a ""hater"", or simply ""just not 'getting' it"", but I obviously overcame this because I am curious as tohow many others are bewildered by the Very Positive ranking that the game gets.Whether that's due to people dismissing the game based on its $0.99 price tag - or the quirky nature of the game's first aesthetic/thematic impression persuading them to ignore it; I can't help but wonder who else would think this game is very, very hollow.I understand that the game isn't supposed to redefine the ""genre"" - or that the game's design suggests it could - but I have to say the whole non-sensical, quirky attitude of the game is trite, boring and uninspired. Just becuase you lack any  coherent sense or a thematic direction doesn't make you a ""cool, indie developer"", thus automatically exempting your game from basic criticism. Instead it shows that the developers have taken ""simplification"" to the extreme, thus yielding the following equation:Spacebar + ""Random"" Art = Very Positive1 out of 5"

Compared to flappy bird its much easier requiring much less precision. Defeating most of the purpose of the game. There is a weird motion blur on incoming enemies. Most levels last a couple minutes at most, and then you have a boss fight in which you pick up power ups. The end result is you get bored, try to brute force your way through, and die pretty fast repeatedly, so you go from egypt to space to christmas land in short succession.

So if you like turbo pug i would reccomend watching videos on this before getting it. It was just so difficult for me to get through levels because there are so many things in the way and there are very little ways to get through the obsacales.

Desert is a bit bright and does not help with the visiblity of the flames, music is cool and unfortunately sometimes ends too early for me to enjoy some funky bass in space. The lifetime of this game is not that long since all one can do to progress is to either beat the leaderboard, unlock some customes and beat some bosses (more outlast a boss).

As a pug with a cape, you fly through space, a neon city, and even a land within the clouds while dodging all manner of enemies, from UFOs to sheep with wings. With a name like ""Super Mega Neo Pug"", I wasn't sure what it would be like, but this game surpassed my expectations.However, I'd like to quickly go over the drawbacks. First of all, this game is BRUTAL at the start, and it takes a while to get used to the physics. This sucks, because once you finally adjust, there's not much to look forward to. The rate of progress will always be seemingly slow and unrewarding. All that keeps me playing is the knowledge of more unlockable characters, as well as certain collectables.That said, however, the character selection is one of my favorite parts. It's not just pugs, ladies and gentlemen. You can play as a dinosaur, a panda, and even a hamster. It takes a while to unlock them, but things get easier as you get better. Also, as you get better, you'll have an easier time collecting these random circular pictures(I don't know what else to call them). They'll appear on your menu and give fun sentences when you hover your mouse over them. The sentences themselves are about as ridiculous as you'd expect from a game called ""Super Mega Neo Pug"".Overall, it's a fun game.Pros:+Charming characters+Charming collectables+Fun enemy designs+It's only a dollar(as of this review).Cons:-Difficult at the start-Slow and unrewarding rate of progress"
