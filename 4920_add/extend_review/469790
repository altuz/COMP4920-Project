,Recommended,469790,29660816,Posted: 2 February,all,GravitySloth❤,What an amazing game! Definitely one of the best puzzle games of the last years.I had a problem with the game and emailed the developer. He gave a prompt reply and within 9 hours the game was patched!I can definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzles.
,Recommended,469790,29620167,Posted: 31 January,all,TheTawaras,This game is amazing.  Visuals are beautiful and the puzzles are challenging and hard but not to a point where it gets frustrating like other games in the same genre.  Also the music is nice and soothing and makes me feel happy when I play.
,Recommended,469790,29608315,Posted: 31 January,all,Osama McHitler,"There's some really great design here in teaching the player the mechanics by showing. Optional objectives (diamonds you can collect) also give insentive to make it harder yourself, which I love. Secret levels are much more challenging, plus they're harder to find. The mechanics (up to world 5, so far) feel natural, and increase challenge gradually. You're always given room to figure out the mechanic's caveats before it mixes it with a previous one. The puzzles can get pretty complex, due to how each mechanic meshes, but they're still simple to figure out, and the solutions are rarely tedious.Gameplay is equal parts logic and timing, but never too hard on either. Difficulty always feels reasonable, never out of your control.A couple times, the game has gone past the boundaries of my 5:4 monitor, but I know that's an uncommon aspect ratio nowadays. Hasn't made it unplayable, though.This is definitely a ""one solution"" puzzle game (if you couldn't figure that out already), so I don't think there's too much in terms of replayability, outside of completing secret levels and collecting all diamonds. I'm hoping for an expansion pack, or a level editor further down the line (no pun intended)"
,Recommended,469790,29620656,Posted: 31 January,all,edderiofer,"I beta-tested this game a few months ago. My name's in the credits. You may wish to take this review with a grain of salt.Regardless, Linelight is an exercise in minimalism. Everything takes place on lines. There are no controls besides moving, and two others (to be revealed elsewhere in the game). How many puzzles, then, could someone possibly squeeze out of it?About 300.Oh right, you want to know more about the mechanics. As you can see in the screenshots and trailer, there are switches that move lines, switches that open doors, keys that open doors, enemies (some only move when you do, some move to the beat of the music, and some repeat your previous movements), spools that allow your line to become longer (so that it can press down multiple switches, among other things), and... well, not too much else actually.Yet throughout all this, there is definitely a whole ton of ideas that Brett Taylor has incorporated; he's really covered all the bases with these puzzles. Most puzzles illustrate a neat consequence of the rules (some are ""reprises"", if you will), so there's not very much wasted space. And for most of these puzzles, there is really nothing quite like them in other games. Using a switch to release an enemy, then getting the enemy to toggle the switch so that you can get to the end is something I don't think I've seen in any other game, yet it's one of the first few puzzles in this game. (It's also Brett's favourite puzzle in the game, if I recall correctly).Note also the amount of polish evident in the game. There is a very abstract nonverbal narrative involving helping other lines through problems (as opposed to the game being just a bunch of line puzzles, which is what some people who haven't played The Witness think of it). The soundtrack is spectacular and catchy (it's still floating around my head after all this time), and enhanced by the subtle percussion that the enemies add. The graphical effects upon entering a level, collecting a star, and so on, just add that tiny bit of prettiness that says ""Yes, the developer put actual effort into this game. Unlike Flow Match or Rolling Shapes."". (And yes, I will be slagging off both of those games in every single review I post on Steam later. Because those two deserve it.) For a one-and-a-half-year one-person project, this is stunningly top-quality. (Unlike Flow Match, which was also a one-and-a-half-year one-person project, and was a complete piece of garbage that I managed to outdo in a single month.)Some puzzles are a little finicky, but other than that, I honestly can't see any fault with this game. This is a strong Puzzle Game Of The Year 2017 contender. Or at least, it would be if I gave out game awards.If any puzzle game in January deserves money, it's probably this one; especially if you're at all interested in puzzles. (Though that having been said, I feel like the game's still a little too expensive. Then again, I'm harsh with price.)(Later parts of the game may not be accessible for people with colour-blindness. You may wish to take this into consideration if you're planning on buying the game during its first two weeks or so. This paragraph will be removed when this problem has been fixed.)Hmm, it seems to be quite difficult for me to actually praise good games rather than go nuclear on terrible ones. That's something I'm going to have to practice."
,Recommended,469790,29711002,Posted: 4 February,all,btown_33,"If someone had told me that I would feel true empathy for little bouncing specks of light on a screen after a couple hours playing a game - that I'd feel like I was running around on a playground with them, or choreographing a dance, or training them as one would a pet... I would have called them crazy. But Linelight is magical like that. It's the Journey of minimalistic puzzle games, and that is an amazing thing.A huge part of it is how the (beautiful) music provides a counterpoint to the game mechanics: you have these ""enemy"" particles that you'd normally feel like you were trying to avoid or run away from, but the music reminds you that you can harness their behavior to help you out. And each ""world"" in the game culminates with a series of puzzles, where you use the behavior you've learned to run alongside a ""partner"" particle, helping it to move forward, helping it to help you to move forward... and then when you inevitably need to part ways, the music is there to underscore the bittersweet end to the partnership. And throughout it all, sound effects blend with the music seamlessly and in a harmonically pleasing way. It's a masterfully calming and thought-provoking experience, and I don't think I've seen anything like it.Other commenters have described how the puzzles aren't the most challenging in the world, and there's not a ton of replayability. But in the context of the experience, that's okay. You're not supposed to pull your hair out, you're supposed to savor the experience. That said, I'm sure there will be speedruns if this game takes off, and eventually community level editing will increase the longevity here.One minor gripe is that on Mac OS X, at least with my configuration, there were some screen tearing glitches, and some of the lighting effects could use some dithering to reduce visible ""rings"" where the color gradient changes. But these are minor, and they don't really break immersion.All in all, this is a game you're not going to want to miss."
,Recommended,469790,29720739,Posted: 5 February,all,*√∞Dangerous∞√*,"one of the most relaxing and clever puzzle games out there.It's already one of the goty contenders of this year for me, what an emotional ride, it really shows that with a simple idea you can create something deep and something that you care about.It also helps that the music is brillantly placed and timed, it's full of visually stunning moments too!I wish more puzzle games would have the same effect on me, it really changes your perspective of what's really important in the videogame medium!"
76561198035710668,Recommended,469790,32967007,Posted: 28 June,all,googolplex33,"Linelight is a fantastic puzzle game. At the beginning, it has very simple but expansive mechanics. Over the course of the game, more mechanics are added, and this allows the puzzles to gain even more depth. It is impressive that the mechanics are all taught through experimentation, rather than much direct instruction. Though the game is not particularly long and is not gruelingly difficult, it provides a very fun and enjoyable experience.Perhaps most impressive (though hard to explain) is the game's ability to evoke so much emotion. The game is literally about lines, and there's nothing more than that. But with the music, animation, and amazing level design, the game really has an emotional impact that I wasn't expecting out of a minimal puzzle game."
,Recommended,469790,29610172,Posted: 31 January,all,Pastry,"I can ascribe two words to this game: charming and delightful. Simple visuals, nice music and sound design, simple puzzle design and slowly introduces more and more mechanics. Some puzzles require some relatively precise timing but otherwise this game gives your brain just enough stimulation to feel satisfied after each puzzle/obstacle. This game is absolutely worth the price of admission to me, and I've only finished a little ways past the first world.Edit: I've progressed further in the game. I'm going to amend this review and say this game makes me unreasonably happy."

They turn into lazy physics platformers, redundant achievment hunts or padded copies of whatever was popular a week ago. You can see the thought and care that went into every minute of this game.

It is one of the most simplistic game you will find, but at the same time, all of the different combinations of puzzles is astounding. I am definitly gifting this game and showing it to freinds, and in a few months, This will be the first game going up on my first Youtube Gaming video."

76561198070453188,Recommended,469790,29638609,Posted: 1 February,all,Innocentive,"Linelight is a very neat simplistic puzzle game that I would highly recommend for any lover of this genre. It has three puzzle worlds each with different puzzle mechanics built around the basic idea of traveling as a light strip along a line. The learning curve for each of these mechanics is just right, not too flat, not too steep. Combine that with the lovely soundtrack that supplements the puzzle experience beautifully and you have a perfect puzzle game!It should be mentioned that most of the puzzles are logical puzzles but there are some that also require some skill. Yet, these skill based puzzles are not frustratingly difficult, they rather add another layer to the experience.And then there are plenty of extra puzzles along the way that do not have to be solved to progress andt hat have a higher difficulty level.This game deserves a definitive thumbs up! Go and get it now ;)"
,Recommended,469790,33403759,Posted: 9 July,all,Scotboy,"This is a great puzzle game. Each world starts with introducing a new mechanic before smoothly dialling up the complexity and adding some interesting twists over the following ~40 puzzles, then it's on to the next world.They're all either tricky enough to make you feel clever or swift enough to not break the flow, which makes it pretty compelling to play. Some seem just like the previous until you notice the subtle change which completely changes the solution. A few can stump you until you realise you've been thinking about it from completely the wrong perspective in manner reminiscent of Hexcells. One or two require some quick reflexes, but this is certainly not a twitchy game.Visually, it's minimalist but exactly as frilly as it needs to be. The music is playful without being irritatingly energetic, and ties in to what's going on on screen in a pleasing way. There's the mildest hint of narrative but no text. It's a puzzle game without pretension. If you're not in the mood for puzzles there is nothing else here to recommend it.I bought it at full price or near enough, and have absolutely no compunction in recommending it to anyone who is even slightly curious. Meanwhile, I'm looking forward to the dev's next game."
,Recommended,469790,29755757,Posted: 6 February,all,[E] Fitch,"Some of my favorite, simple pleasures about a puzzle game.1 - music that responds to characters and characters that respond to the music.It's not a rhythm game, but having the sound on helps with the red lines, sometimes.2 - learning by solving on my own, leading up to complicated puzzles that can be solved instantly3 - catchy, light music and gentle, purposeful sound effects that nobodoy minds having on in the living room4 - playable by any skill levelHard to believe I live with someone who's never used a modern controller, but they still were able to use this to hone their analog-stick skills, and when the puzzle required more timing and quickness, the game's levels are such that the more challenging ones can be bypassed.5 - love and heart went into the game, and you can tell.6 - many beautiful moments with just enough real-world abstractiondifferent people interpret the endings of each level so differently, because the characters are just lines. People extrapolate their own 2D and 3D worldviews on these little 1D dudes."
76561197995651916,Recommended,469790,29935241,Posted: 14 February,all,PeppyHare,"Incredibly clever, Linelight excels at creating playfulness from minimal gameplay elements. ""Infuriating"" and ""frustrating"" are often used as positives when reviewing puzzle games, but I'd describe Linelight instead as relaxing and comforting in the way the game teaches you deceptively simple mechanics, tests you on them, then combines them with other mechanics in unexpected ways.Linelight manages to create emotion and character without resorting to an unnecessary narrator or text. Pacing is excellent, balancing fast and slow moments while also balancing dexterity-based challenges with thoughtful puzzles. The soundtrack perfectly fits each level and I look forward to the new music in each world."

76561198042988029,Recommended,469790,29888286,Posted: 12 February,all,seymourbutts93,Fun and increasingly challenging game. The minimalistic design coupled with the music is an elegant combination.
,Recommended,469790,29889540,Posted: 12 February,all,ajemas,"This game is truly one of the hidden gems on Steam, and deserves FAR more recognition than it is currently getting. The game has a very minimalist style, with bright, contrasting colors and an appealing design, along with some very relaxing music. However, this belies the true genius of the puzzle design. You control a single strand of white light that can manipulate its surroundings by traveling along a straight path to flip switches and unlock doors, revealing more and more of the map as the player progresses. This simple mechanic is pushed to its limits with some truly brilliant puzzle designs that are challenging while not being frustrating to solve.In addition, each new world that the player travels to introduces a novel puzzle mechanic to create myriad opportunities for interesting and fun gameplay. In this aspect it's very reminicent of Braid, but with more of a focus on pure puzzle design than abstract video game meta-narrative. The prospect of getting to see what new mechanics and brain teasers will be presented gives all of the incentive needed to keep pushing through the game, making it very difficult to put down, and even harder to get out of your head.All in all, this game is a criminally underrated knockout. I'd highly recommend watching the trailer to decide if it's your style, but honestly if you're into puzzle games in the slightest then you're doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game right away."

,Recommended,469790,29875269,Posted: 12 February,all,Tiberis,"To sum up this game in one word: Beautiful.This is a superb game, which, while looking simplistic, takes you on quite an engaging journey through many, many levels.The music and visuals are kept clean, they suit the game perfectly and are never understated or over the top.Without so much as a tutorial or explanation, this game shows you everything you need to know to complete every level and secret. Progression is a good steady pace. Couple of times you really have to stop and think, which is good.You do actually get quite a lot for your money too, for those thinking it's not worth the price. Either take the plunge and be rewarded or put it on your wishlist to make sure you get it later."

It's a big game too, intricately designed with a lot of hidden things which I'm just discovering. Can't recommend it enough."
76561198047499015,Recommended,469790,29748831,Posted: 6 February,all,zaiquiri,"Others have said it, but it bears repeating. This game is solid.Design/Gameplay:It is like the developer watched every ""How to design great games"" video on youtube and followed them to a T. All the mechanics are intutive and easy to execute. Each new concept was introduced in isolation before ramping up the difficulty. Concepts also weren't beaten to death, no 60 levels of the same mechanic with slightly more precise timing to be had here.Aesthetic:I thorourghly enjoyed the look and feel of the game. Visuals were enticing and the music was on point. Honestly, the music is what pushed Linelight from a good puzzle game to a great game (period). It added so much more character to a floppy line than I would have thought possible.Again, Linelight is solid. If you are a fan of well designed games you have to pick this up. You are missing out otherwise."

You play the role of the hero, Liney, and must guide him safely past numerous pitfalls and locked doors whilst being ever-aware of the notoriously mean Red lines. Sometimes Liney will meet other colours of lines, which can hurt or help in equal measure.I became quite attached to one of my little Orange line friends, as we helped each other along the line track, and wished him a fond farewell when our paths finally split.I would recommend this game for fun, relaxing logic puzzles which  are satisfying to solve."

This slice of life starring a set of firework sparks learning to cooperate and help each other realize their dreams, really tugs at the heartstrings. 100% guaranteed to get the waterworks flowing. Definitely this year's most likely to win the ""walking in Thomas Was Alone's footsteps"" award.The actual game is pretty great too; very Braid like in the ""don't repeat yourself, keep surprising the player with new mechanics"" sense. It sits in that magical space of, ""was that easy, or just super intuitive and I happen to be a genius?"" puzzle space where you're challenged, but the rewards keep flowing. I got actually stuck a grand total of once, very late in the main story game where I'd just plain failed to see the obvious answer. Eventually getting that green star really did make me grin though :)Finally, Brett the game's creator? Genuinely sweet guy; met him at one of the gaming festivals. This game is already worth it on its own merits, but if you decide to jump in, know that you're also helping to keep alive something genuinely precious in the videogames scene. Hopefully we'll get plenty more where this came from."

The concept seems very basic, but there are constantly new mechanics and ideas introduced into the puzzles that make them really deep and interesting. There are very few timing/skill-based puzzles, so the focus is always on creativity and problem solving. The controls are super simple and flawlessly executed. The dreamy soft graphics with nice piano music make the game a joy to play, and never frustrating trying to figure out a solution. The puzzles are never really too difficult, but also never boring. There are plenty of secret puzzles that are a bit more challenging too.But the best part has to be how much charm and character and story is delivered through these tiny little lines. It's an amazing achievement, and a breath of fresh air after playing so many similar puzzle games that just feel soulless and dry."

,Recommended,469790,33619205,Posted: 17 July,all,Tetuous,"I would recommend this game if you enjoy simple puzzle games where the focus is on immersing you in a calming atmosphere and giving you a slight challenge every so often.I would not recommend this game if you enjoy puzzle games that challenge you to work through complex problems and if you're not easily immersed. If you're not immersed, the collective hour you spend just moving from puzzle to puzzle or watching one of the different-coloured lines escape from the grid and float around freely will only serve to waste your time rather than emotionally engage you.As someone from the latter category, I was pretty bored. I put on other entertainment to the side as I waited for the game to ramp up in difficulty, and it never did. I had to stop and think three times throughout the entire game and all three times it was due to me missing a mechanic that I didn't realise existed and I hadn't required previously. There are ""secret"" paths that you can hunt for that lead to a bit of extra challenge -- but not enough challenge to stop me from solving them almost immediately, and I don't consider myself awfully adept at puzzle games. My hours played are inflated from leaving the game on in the background, and by the time I'd completed all the non-hidden puzzles in the game I couldn't be bothered to hunt for the rest of the hidden ones in the hope for more complexity.I recommend it in general though as I clearly wasn't the target audience, and it seems to have been made with a lot of thought and care for those that it's aimed at."

I strongly recommend use of a controller, as there are a few puzzles that are timing based, and even more that require a bit more finesse than a keyboard delivers. Overall, however, I found only 4 or so puzzles that required multiple tries due to my lack of reflexes (and most of these being optional as well). Most timing difficulties are actually the result of attempting an incorrect solution.There are 240 main puzzles and 60 optional challenge puzzles, split among 8 worlds. Each world will introduce a major new mechanism (generally a new type of ""line"") and start you with simple puzzles that will escalate in difficulty as you progress through the world. Later worlds will also integrate some mechanics from previous worlds to add some variety. Given the sheer number of puzzles, the general lack of repititiveness in puzzles was also refreshing. Each world ends with a ""tandem"" segment in which you solve puzzles in tandem with the new line type that was introduced in the given world. Solutions for these segments are generally easier, but generate a nice kineticism and build-up as you work with your ""partner"" in a final sprint to the finish.The use of multiple worlds to generate new mechanics, the way the worlds build up as you play, and the terminal segments all help create diversity and break up the monotony of solving the same problem over and over again, which can be a failing of a lot of games in this genre. Altogether, these elements, with a very nice accompanying responsive score help generate a sense of flow (and even a bit of narrative force) in the game that puts Linelight a cut above the rest."

To call this a puzzle game is insulting, maybe if you are in the 1st grade this is a puzzle game. Otherwise it is just shiny colors and a minimilistic sound track, no challenge, no depth, annoying sounds. Don't believe the reviews, save your money. Worst game I have played in 2k17"

The puzzles aren't super hard but some did take a couple tries to figure out. The only problem I see right now is controller is recommended, but the control scheme is only for keyboard. Also I can't select play with a controller and at some point during World 1 the button prompts only came up for keyboard and I could only move with the controller and not do any of the abilities. It could be my controller or it could be a bug."

,Recommended,469790,29721900,Posted: 5 February,all,wheatleyco,Added thoughts after completing the gameWhat a unique puzzle game.This game just involves moving along a line segment and pushing various switches so that you can go on your merry way ahead. There is no jumping in this game and you have short levels and an immediate restart button if you die. Yes you can die in this game by colliding with red segments who are enemies and yellow segments who are your friends but you cannot cross each other. This is such a beautiful game with the yellow segment helping you out in puzzles where you have to work together. The puzzles are easy but the level of uniqueness of the setting absolutely will grab you. A must buy for gamers who like minimalistic puzzle games with unique settings.This game has some really soothing and beautiful music too. There is absolutely no dialogue in this game but when my companion segment left me it was really emotional.Also fighting with enemy segments was really fun.This game needs to be experienced by all puzzle fans This is one of the gems that we comeacross once in about 2-3 years. Absolutely phenomenal game. Highly recommended. This game makes you attached to a line segment. It reminds me a lot of Thomas was alone where blocks got you emotionally attached. I have just played an hour and am really loving this game. I am not sure how long it is but I have cleared about 40 levels. There are certain yellow blocks which I think so I have collected all till now and also green blocks which I have seen only one of till now.I am in the Level 2 area as of now and new mechanics have been introduced. Please consider this as a first impressions for now but I do hope all the new worlds would be introducing some new mechanics.I would give it a thumbs up based on my first impressions just because of the totally unique setting.I have now completed the game and the last world world 6 and the +a and +b were the only worlds where few of the puzzles became a bit tedious to solve due to a mechanic introduced. These levels could have been more intutive. It just got repetitive throughout. Overall still recommended.
