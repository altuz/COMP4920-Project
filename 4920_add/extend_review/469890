Tho the game is not completely finished yet (missing controller support, graphics options) the look & feel makes it quite fun and it is challenging. Or rather not? Some ppl brag that the game is beatable in under 10 mins because of overly easyness. I cannot cover this. To score over 100k points a decent guide of ""how to gain the 100x multiplier"" is strongly missing. Otherwise they just got it lucky without knowing what they were doing."

Long story short; every review has to answer the question as to whether you would recommend the game or not. I wouldn't recommend this. I'd say go off and play something like Geometry Wars instead.HOWEVER, it's not like the game is bad. It's just completely inoffensive, There's a few bugs but nothing majorly broken, the gameplay is fine but nothing to write home about by a long shot, and so on. I played it for 45 minutes (And left it running to get the trading cards DON'T JUDGE ME) and will never touch it again, but for the price I paid I can't complain; You can easily spend three times as much on a cup of coffee, for goodness sake. There's better out there, yeah, but you won't hate yourself if you end up buying this."

(UPDATE: I've got this one too now, with the same ship)The game is pretty easy but with time, unless you properly position yourself and shoot accurately, you will be overwhelmed. The background score sounds good too.If the dev hasn't done so already, I hope he thinks about releasing this game on the Android, iOS and Windows 10 Mobile platforms too, because this has potential to be a fun game to play on the go."

The only interesting point if you're into achievements is that you can 100% the game within 10 minuts. Otherwise, save your time and money."
,Recommended,469890,23048749,"Posted: 17 May, 2016",all,Sanny,"Every now and then I like to page through Steam and see if I can find any weird, cheap games. I usually find nothing, but today I found Space Codex! It's normally $.99, but I got it on sale for $.59. Even even if a game doesn't look that great, who could pass it up at that price? Not I. And it even had good reviews! Wowza! (There were only six reviews, but everyone seemed to like it)Space Codex is a straight forward, top-down twin-stick style arcade shooter. Bad guys fly towards you and you shoot them, that's just about the whole game. There is a handful of power-ups and a few different enemy types. There are also three different ship types to choose from, each with different stats.The basic gameplay is simple but pretty solid, and the music is surprisingly good. There is a pretty good variety of tracks, too. With a game this small, they could have easily gotten away with a single repeating track, so the variety is appreciated.Now, here's a few of the gripes I have with the game:(A couple hours after posting my review on Steam, the dev commented on it and told me he'd fixed a lot of the issues. I'm very impressed!)-Once you choose your ship, you can't go back. You have to reset the game(Apparently, you just have to hit escape, then click ""Select Ship"". This wasn't even an issue that actually needed fixed. I just didn't think to hit escape because I'm a dummy.)-Power-ups are hard to see against the stars in the background. The shield especially, since it's just a light-blue circle.(The dev added a nice glow effect to all the power-ups. Not only are they easier to see now, but they look cool, too!)-No controller support.(Controller support is being worked on.)(If you have a Steam Controller, I've uploaded a control scheme for the game, feel free to use that.)-No Leaderboard.(Leaderboards are also being worked on.)-There is a small window after dying where hitting the boost key restarts the game.(You can totally ignore that complaint now. Totally fixed!)Like I said, the dev very quickly fixed most of the issues I had with their game. I can definitely recommend it now. It's good fun, especially for the price it's being sold at."

,Recommended,469890,23531000,"Posted: 12 June, 2016",all,Summer Hopeflyte,"A true masterpiece of retro-styled games. The magenta and cyan (CGA graphics, of course!) really do bring back the old days of when space shooters were practically the only thing you could get. This one, however unlike the many clones of the 80's, actually does it right! It's smooth, fast paced and really does turn into a bullet hell game after a short bit. I'd love to see a retail release of this, even if it's not a huge release. Just y'know, a side release. I digress, though. This is one of those games, that, like many other truely old games is very fun in short bursts. This is a lesser known gem of the steam market."

,Recommended,469890,23058036,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,N O O C X,"Lured by the soundtrack and charming graphics I bought this game yesterday. I was a little bit concerned about the slow-paced speed shown in the video, for the low price however I did not care too much.Music is good. Really, I would buy the game again solely for the different tracks and all these lovely bling and beep sounds. The graphic also fits my taste, quite simple, quite retro. And the gameplay is fun, not overwhelming fun, but good fun in an addictive way. At first I've thought that a slightly higher speed maybe would feel better, but after spending some time with the game I really much like the speed as it is. There are three different ships of choice with different speed and for me it is the high maneuverability in small areas that brings the sexiness. Dodging feels good, power-ups are basic but nice, there is also a boost ability which is kinda useful and a charged shot, which I don't use often.I definitely like Space Codex and recommend it. The preview pretty much presents the game as it is. Don't expect too much more. It is a nice little game, if you like what you see and hear, get it. Apart from that I'm really impressed by the fast and friendly feedback from the developer, I've sent him some small points for improvements which have been implemented already. This guy is doing a great job!7/10"

,Recommended,469890,24311897,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Love💋,"Got it with a Steam Coupon for 10 cents. Well basically this is a space shooter, kinda like asteroids. You pick your ship in the beginning with different attributes and then shoot other ships in a quadratic area. On your way you pick up items like a shield or temporary firing modes. Presented to you with neon pink and purple aesthetics and a really suprisingly great chiptune soundtrack for such a little game. After 10 minutes you get every achievement and those other 8 hours of my playtime were basically just idling for the cards.I guess its alright if you like to get high scores and have not much to do and want to spend your time quickly. Otherwise there isn't much to say about  here to be honest."

,Not Recommended,469890,33064603,Posted: 30 June,all,Zonrith,"Not exactly what I would consider a ""bullet hell"" style shoot 'em up. Yes, there are a lot of bullets. The game seems to want to be a twin-stick shooter, but the ship's pacing and shooting lacks the frantic nature of a Geometry Wars. The bullet evasion and combat with the enemy ships lacks the frantic nature of a Cave bullet hell.Overall, pretty disappointing. The game would have been better designed around a controller with a focus on twin-stick support. Controller support on this can work, but you'll miss aiming with the mouse because the controller feels unresponsive by comparison.Music is somewhat annoying. Graphically it is totally uninspired."

,Not Recommended,469890,28917813,Posted: 1 January,all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","New-school version of Asteroids. Easy achievements, but not too much replayability. You can potentially be done with the game as soon as 5 minutes if you can combo quick enough.Once you're done with the achievements, there's really no reason to go back to play any more. There are no leaderboards or really any levels past the first. The soundtrack is just okay, unlike many other cheapo bargain bin games, it does have the potential to play a different tune after you restart.Overall, this is a game I completed on the completionist trail, if you're doing the same, don't let me stop you; otherwise, I'd pass on this game, it did nothing to improve the genre. It's just a prettier version of Asteroids, and Asteroids was boring as hell."
