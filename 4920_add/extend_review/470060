,Recommended,470060,24461647,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,somebody336,"1917 The Alien Invasion tells the tale of well, an alien invasion during WW1. Dr. Brunhield Stahlmuller has taken it upon herself to get on her triplane and take to the skies to bring the fight to the alien menace. Or so I believe. With the trippy soundtrack, flying a plane through space and giant naked dudes at the end of each stage I'm starting to imagine she is utterly mad. Nonetheless it is up to us to take back our giant naked men from these evil alien scum across 5 varied levels. You'll have two modes of fire, a weak spread shot and a narrow focused barrage that makes it more difficult to control your plane.That can easily get you killed but you have unlimited opportunities to restart at the beginning of a stage albeit missing all your power ups such as adding extra projectiles while firing. Shouldn't be much of a problem however since this title is rather easy and the focus seems to be on gathering huge high-scores instead of just completing the game. It is a very short game and can be completed in a little of over 10+ minutes. Each of the levels are extremely short and you'll be facing that stage's boss in no time. The bosses are where most of the challenge comes from and can get you off guard with their rather fast moving projectiles the first time around.Unless you pick up a shield beforehand a single shot will kill you and send you all the way back to the start of the level. There are not much enemy types to face but the environments and music change quite drastically level per level. One moment you'll be on earth flying over the trenches filled with humans trying in vain to defend their home while music that wouldn't sound out of place in Hotline Miami plays then on the next you are flying through space, avoiding asteroids to a rather surreal sounding track. It is without a doubt a weird game but that lends it its own flair. Plus, the announcer is simply superb and shouts lines akin to Killer Instinct such as “Combo!” with great effect of getting you hyped.Music is another highlight and really makes me glad there is a soundtrack available to purchase for this title. The screen is rarely filled with too many bullets but if you need a quick escape there is the option to call in a Valkyrie to carpet bomb the area to wipe out all enemies (not bosses) and projectiles. After completing each stage by brutally destroying the boss as he dramatically explodes, you get a shred of story though it's nothing that you'll remember after shutting down the game. It doesn't reinvent or innovate upon the shump genre in anyway but it's a ton of fun to play for five bucks and controls perfectly. It's only real flaw is the insanely short time it takes to complete which may be a tough pill to swallow for some even at its low price. Still, if you are looking for a quick and casual Shmup, 1917 The Alien Invasion is a very solid bite sized game."

Based on an alternative timeline where Aliens invade Earth during WW1. You play as Dr. Brunhield Stahlmüller who upgrades the traditional bi-plane to take the fight to the aliens. Featuring 5 levels, the difficulty balance felt right, it started simple and the final level was challenging. Shmup (shoot ‘em up) veterans might find this game easy, but for beginners or the intermediates (like me) it felt just right. The music is catchy if you love electronic beats, and the alien designs are inspired and quite grotesque. Despite being a very basic story, the ending was actually interesting despite stories not being important at all for this style of game. There is only one type of weapon which can be upgraded, and just a warning, when you die you start at the beginning of the level. Definitely recommend for shmup fans.Subscribe to Fox Plays on YouTube for more indie games and Let’s Plays"
,Recommended,470060,31736237,Posted: 13 May,all,papaya,"It's a good shmup. Not a great one, not a bad one, but a fairly solid one. Fans of the genre are starved enough for good quality games as is, and this one is honestly one of the better ones.The graphics are truly retro - a lot of indie games will claim to be retro by making your character a blob of pixels, but this looks honestly like it couldve come out of the arcade era. The soundtrack is alright, not groundbreaking but certainly not bad.It is, notably, a shmup and not a strict bullet hell - the hitbox is kinda vague, and there's less focus on massive bullet patterns and subtle dodging and more on just rote memorization of where each enemy spawns. The patterns generally amount to ""a bunch of bullets in a wave"" or ""a bunch of bullets in a line"" from bosses, which is a bit of a shame.It's alright/10 but for a game that costs as much as a cheap lunch you could do a lot worse."
,Recommended,470060,23841062,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Cream-of-Plenty,"UPDATE DEC 2016:As of December, 1917: The Alien Invasion has been replaced with a ""DX"" version that includes 3 additional levels and bosses, 3 new planes with distinct properties, and a whole ton of graphical and audio updates.It's 1917 and aliens have invaded earth.  As Dr. Brunhield Stahlmüller, you must use your rocket-powered Tri-Plane to take the fight back to the aliens.The game follows a pretty typical Shoot 'Em Up model over the course of eight levels:  You'll encounter wings of smaller fighters, larger and slower opponents, stationary ground targets, and obstacles that instakill on collision.  Bosses float around and spam ""bullethell"" patterns.  You can pick up power-ups that upgrade your weapons and shields.  If you have any experience with Shoot 'Em Ups (and I'm by no means an expert) you'll recognize the most of the mechanics right away.Therewerea couple of things that weren't immediately obvious to a casual player like myself, however.  Toward the beginning of each map is a key-shaped power-up; picking it up unlocks your combo, which allows you to obtain score multipliers by killing enemies--these multiplierssignificantlyaffect the points you make.  But the combo multiplier is time-sensitive, and waiting too long between killing enemies (or dying) will reset it to 1.   Right before each boss is a complementary power-up that ""locks"" your multiplier until you pick up another key, which allows you to maintain your multiplier between levels.There are also two fire modes available from the beginning of the game which, from the sounds of things, isn't apparent to a lot of players.  In fact, the way I figured it out was because I had to rearrange the inputs for my gamepad.  The ""normal"" mode fires a lighter round, whereas the ""heavy"" mode fires a more powerful shot that pushes your plane backwards and makes steering more difficult.  Given the amount of projectiles, obstacles, and enemies that might have to be dodged at any given moment, there's a very tangible risk/reward aspect to using the heavier fire mode.  Obtaining a power upgrade improves both modes.Originally I had a few ""cons"" for this game that involved limited weapon variety and a (short) five levels. Both of these issues have been remedied with the December post-release update that added 3 more distinct planes (for a total of 4) and 3 more levels (for a total of 8), as well as a level select mode.  The new planes, in particular, double as additional difficulty modes--with the final unlockable ""Fleischdecker"" essentially serving as an ""insane"" setting.In fact, the only remaining cons are that when enemies are defeated, they spawn golden birds/stars that will fly towards your ship.  It's part of the score/combo system, but the issue is that it creates a LOT of on-screen noise and makes the actual act of avoiding enemies and projectiles a lot more difficult.  It's one thing to accidentally maneuver into an asteroid, or get shot down by enemy fire--it's another to lose sight of your plane because there's too much stuff on screen.Additionally, in order  to genuinely keep a combo going for a longer period (1000+), the player needs to have esoteric knowledge of the levels and enemy placement, since there are many areas where you can kill everything on screen and have your multiplier ""cool"" off before you get the opportunity to continue it.  Unintuitively, you occasionally need to leave enemies on screen for longer than normal, simply to keep the multiplier from expiring.  In my opinion, this is an annoying quality.All-in-all, 1917 should provide enough enjoyment for anybody interested in a game reminiscent of a Genesis-era Shoot 'Em Up.  I would highly recommend it to anybody nostalgic for a more aesthetically bizarre shooter."

Its scenario, its design, its story, its music, well, everything is good.During the WW1, the war changed as the world has to fight against aliens. A German scientist build a prototype airplane (build from alien spaceship) to be able to fight against the ennemy... and it works !5 euros for this game, go and buy it, you won't regret it."

It felt like it was just starting when it was already over. The design is great in every single way. One thing that could use more polish are the boss attacks. They are extremely simple. Using more than one type of bullet would already help a lot, and the patterns could really afford to be more complicated, and still compliment the ship's speed/hitbox's sweet spot. Think Truxton 2.Besides that, I would love to see more. With stages of this length, I wouldn't mind there being 15/20, with the difficulty curve going 5 stages further than where it ends now. You would still be able to go through it in a single session, without getting tired of it."

,Not Recommended,470060,23828527,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Vyse,"This game is targeted more at fans of Raptor: Call of the Shadows than at fans of japanese bullet hell shooters, which is something to keep in mind.1917 has five levels which each last for about two minutes, but you have to beat each of them in one life. In stages 1-4 that is not a problem because you get a constant supply of shields, but the final level derives most of its difficulty from environmental hazards that kill you in one hit. The final boss has a randomized bullet pattern that can trap you.Pro:+ Good controller support+ Imaginative art style+ Funny scriptCons:- Only one ship- Only two weapons, which are both spread guns- No selectable difficulty levels- The first four levels are way too easy for danmaku veterans. Level 5 is very hard, but only due to Trail & Error / RNG.- Very uncreative boss attacks. It's just a cycle of spread shots and aimed shots that repeats every five seconds.Verdict: Buy Bullet Heaven 2 instead."

Listening to the repeated starting of some of these levels has left me headed off to play Postal 2, Hatred, or something else to blow off steam a while.

,Recommended,470060,31088763,Posted: 11 April,all,lazertRex,"1917 - The Alien Invasion is a must have for shmup fans. The graphics remind me of some of the better Turbo Grafx 16 shmups like Final Soldier or even Image Fight 2.The bullet patterns become very challenging and the levels and enemies/bosses are each unique. World War 1 alien invasion is such a cool concept and the game holds true to classic shooters, while still taking advantage of modern technology with great response and subtle artistics improvements that probably weren't possible in the 16 bit era.This game is a steal for full price so if you get it while it is on sale you mine as well mug the developer for his pocket change.I would love to try out any project they have in the works.
