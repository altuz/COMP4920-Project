,Recommended,470210,29725465,Posted: 5 February,all,TheEngiGuy,"Rocketbirds 2: Evolution puts you - once again - in control of Hardboiled Chicken after the events of the first game. This sequel is a drastic improvement, fixing what were the weak points of the previous title (while being more focused on run 'n' gun shooting), and for that, it's a great indie title that shouldn't be missed. However, I do miss a few things that were present in the first game.+ Rocketbirds 2 finally lets you aim freely in every direction with a much greater variety of weapons at your disposal, from ordinary assault rifles to laser guns.+ Artstyle is the same from the first game, but switched to 2.5D; a mix of lighthearted humour and serious atmosphere in very detailed environments.+ Godlike soundtrack by ""New World Revolution"", bringing Science Fiction Rock to every moment of the game.+ Full-fledged boss fights and many different types of enemies will keep you on your toes 'till the end.+ A separate, replayable co-op story mode featuring procedural levels, more weapons and the ability to earn and spend credits for general upgrades. Playing this mode solo with stackeable teammates is also possible.- Occasional frame drops and shady netcode.- Rolling, frag grenades and cover system from the first game didn't carry over to this sequel."

The boss battles and enemy personalities really added to the excitement.Part Two serves as an introduction to the multiplayer, although it can be played solo, which I done. You go on a series of search and rescue missions while earning money to purchase weapons, upgrades, and cosmetics. This part added alot to my overall gametime and only slightly felt repetitive at times. It helped that solo players are given the option to hire an AI partner to assist.My only complaint about this two part system is that I felt the ending of part two's ""story"" was incredibly anti-climatic and felt like a regular level, which of course is intentional as you can continue playing and upgrading; However I would have loved to have seen one final epic encounter. That being said, the ending of chapter one was very exciting and in some ways nostaglic (reminded me of some nes and snes classics)Overall I definitely recommend, especially if you enjoyed the first."
76561198064553439,Recommended,470210,29600721,Posted: 31 January,all,FEELSBADMAN™,- Fast Action Paced gameplay throughout the lengthy campaign with humorous dialogue.- Tons of weapons. Each with unique feel and distinct purposes.- UPGRADABLE weapons and items / cosmetics- Campaign does not feel repetitive at all due to the introduction of a wide variety of enemies.- Seperate multiplayer coop of up to 4 players. (Optional) The campaign is still very well produced if u are planningto play single player.- I dont usually play 2D shooters with keyboard and mouse but somehow they get the controls to feel right andresponsive.- Tons of character to unlock and the ungrading system enhances the replay value of this already awesome game.I give this game a 9/10 for what it is and trying to be.

,Recommended,470210,29702146,Posted: 4 February,all,Agent Seagull,"Rocketbirds 2  overall gives a great experience. The singleplayer campaign built up upon some basic concepts from the last game but with more cutscenes, weapons and puzzles on the go. Co-op is great with friends but can feel a little bit of a grind at times and cutscenes, after the tutorial felt a bit rushed."

I don't have the best computer so these lower requirement games are nice, but don't let that throw you off. The first 6 chapters playing as Hardboiled were very, very fun. Way more skill and action-packed then the first. It was hard to get used to the new art style because I did like that from the first one but you get used to it. It was a very fun game, very smooth and good music as well. So many more guns you can interchange while on the field is huge game changer.Although there is really nothing to hate about this game in my opinion, the cutscenes on my game have the audio played before the cutscene starts so its always delayed a good 4 seconds, which gets annoying. It's bearable though, I think that's just my♥♥♥♥♥♥laptop."

76561197983545926,Recommended,470210,29567999,Posted: 29 January,all,FudoAkira,"It feels like the devs have kept everything that made the first one enjoyable intact. Good controls, lighthearted humor, nice artwork - winning combo in my book. And right now they give you the first game free with a purchase. Honestly, can't beat it if you are new to these developers' work. The 'stacking' mechanic in part 2 is giving me flashbacks to Serious Sam DD with the amount of options that could be possible. However, part 2 becomes kind of a grind to progress as far as I can tell, with some of the artifact parts being randomly spawned in levels. After repeating the same set of map pieces for the dozenth time and you don't get that final piece (or any piece), it gets old pretty quickly; despite all the gun upgrade options. If you are looking to play MP with your friends, just pick it up and you'll likely have fun. If you are playing it solo like me, you may want to wait for at least a 50% sale, since part 1 might be the only part you'll like."
