From my time playing it, I discovered people would still punish me for not pressing Uno, even after I did. The game also crashed multiple times when trying to connect to online, and sometimes just froze up while connecting. Not to mention, you have to play it through uplay, which is a bit annoying to be honest. I wouldn't recommend this if you're buying it alone. It might be fun if you buy it with friends."

Rabbids is definitely a great feature in the game that i have never experienced before..- in the online multiplayer menu, you can join any random match that is already on the way.. or you can create your own match, of which you can choose which of sets of rules to keep in the game.. for example: you can turn-off the 0-7 swap-card feature, and switch on the 'No Bluff' feature..and then you can decide whether to make the match open for anyone to join in, or keep it private for only-friends to join in..`if you have created a open match, with only you and one other player in the game.. you can choose to start the game with bots to fill the other 2 positions.. and within minutes, other people will replace those bots..people can move-in and out anytime during a match replacing the bots or being replaced by bots.. and this happens smoothly..`3 out 10 matches, i had error messages while playing online.. and i can COMPLETELY understand why people are so critical of Ubisoft and Uplay..when the game freezes on you, and when you are being kicked-out from a very long challenging match, you are within your right to feel offended and outraged..but then, you'll have those long matches where everything works as it should be.. so you will have the biggest smile on your face playing UNO..this game could have been 5/5 or an A-, if Ubisoft and Uplay can address the issued in this game.. and of they could find a way to introduce in-game chat-box to chat with other players..but because of those connection issues.. i give it a 4/5.."

So I hoped this version had enough stuff, without going overboard, while mantaining cohesion. Sadly, to a longtime UNO fan like me, it isn't the case.This Ubisoft version mandates the dreaded Uplay, and if that wasn't enough of a hassle, to add insult to injury, not being happy with you forking $10 Euros to Ubisoft, when you're playing with the standard deck, out of a sudden, randomly, when you draw a card you might come across one that ♥♥♥♥s up with everyone's cards, advertising Rayman's paid DLC deck. Appalling! Imagine a racing game where you're driving in any given track and then, all of a sudden, a car materializes besides you, rams you over the track and a message pops up telling you to buy that car that just crashed into you. Unbelievable, isn't? Well, that's what you get with Ubisoft here.Refunded."

Granted, I should have paid attention to all the negative reviews and not take them as total bs. Unless you have friends who also own Uno, do not expect to play multi-player. The online multi-player quick match simply does not work 90% of the time, and even if it somehow manages not to crash, there's not that many players online to play against regardless. I would definitely recommend playing the demo, which is free and you can still play with like friends/family, but until issues are fixed, it's pretty much the only play-able version."

Trying to invite your friends to a game, having the game successfully start, and have all players finish the game turned out to be impossible. If you can manage to get through the irritating task of getting all your friends in the same lobby without anyone being kicked for no reason or the game crashing, you are already lucky. Sometimes once you select to start your game, it just crashes for no reason. If this doesn't happen, then it is most likely that either you or at least one of your friends will drop out in the middle of a game and be replaced by an AI.I bought this game at full price, and unfortunately I wouldn't even recommend it on sale. It was unplayable. If it was just me experiencing these issues, I could possibly say that my computer just didn't like the game, but each of my friends had the same problems.

When I did it, it only gave me the option to leave the lobby and not start the game when I had a full lobby.- Because you're using the ubisoft uplay app in connection with steam your player icon and name can be different, or even no player icon at all. you have to go through the process again of opening uplay and editting your player icon on their website.- Couldn't figure out how to make a comment whilst the game was in play.CONCLUSIONThis is a fun game even if you don't play with your friends,I'll continue to play.Though it would be nice if I could create a lobby and start said lobby.The only way I see playing with friends is if you join a game at the same exact time and hope you all get put into the same lobby.Thankfully I haven't had any crashes or disconnections unlike some of the reviews that i've seen.EDITSo i've had a few disconnects and times where a player has also disconnected but the game lags into bringing in a bot takes roughly 5 minutes to bring in a bot of someone who has disconnected, but no lag when someone is taking over a bot.But it hasn't ruined my perspective of the game, i just hope they can do a major update to fix the games lag issues and random disconnects, plus I still can't start an online game with me being the host no idea why that is, the button to 'open the lobby' once clicked, it goes away and doesn't reveal the start game button, which is annoying.I also had a time where i clicked someones profile whilst in game and it wouldn't let me leave and the game kept going, 3 turns later i was kicked."

It has a leveling system which if there is a reason for it I haven't seen it, kinda pointless but makes things more fun I guess. There are the normal UPlay rewards Soundtrack, Bonuses, etc. (UPlay...

The controller support is also very much welcome in a game where I'd rather launch that through the monitor than my mouse and keyboard.There's even some theme packs that I am yet to look into, but the 'Rabbids' pack that came with the game is brilliant fun to try out, occasionally due to all of the extra power-up cards and absurd visuals it brings with it. If the other packs bring this much enjoyment, then I will be sure to purchase them in the future too.But for now, I have had significantly more fun with this £7.99 game than I have had with many other games of five times that price, and I would give it a glowing recommendation.If you have friends willing to play it with you, anyway, as the bots are pure, unadulterated evil.10/10 - My friendships are weaker/stronger because of Uno."

Lots of issues connecting with friends and partying up.If you don't intend on hosting your own lobbies with custom settings and to instead just join random ones, or play offline -then this is probably passable for you. Personally, I'd wait until Ubisoft release a patch.Game also has no online ranking elo system (unlike it's XBLA console version from 09') and all achievements are bound to Ubisoft's Uplay.Less said about Uplay, the better...There is no video settings, other than resolution and brightness; together with controls leads me to believe this is just a straight port of the console version from last summer.Real shame. If only a little more effort had gone into this version, I'm sure it would have been heaps better."

I went back and forth with tech support to figure out why, did a repair installation of my OS and even removed some other drivers only to find out that a built in graphics chip set is clearly not enough to run what I tohught would be such a simple game, and there are no options to lower the graphics quality to help built in chip set run better for those that would like to play with their friends.Simply put, this game runs worse than Portal 2 which too me seems like a much more involved game as it requires physics and should be much more demanding on the machine running it.Very disappointed in Ubisoft."

The game will like 99% of the time crash on finding your first online game a restart usually fixes this but even then sometimes it will lock up within the game and youll have to leave.

It's also the first game from ubisoft that doesn't really crash or that will never deceive you. Playing with friends is totally the key for few hours of good time.Good Points : You will always play again , there is no time limit on this game . Amazing animations and gamemode editor. We can play 2 vs 2 which is totally awesome to get the party started and 10$ for this game is totally a joke (Worth)!.Bad Points : Impossible to share a webcam with everyone only with friends , but that's still fun. There is no way to filter what kind of game you are looking for. Lack of groups to join a game if you want to play 2 vs 2 , there is like no way to invite your friend to search for a game."

One solution is to start an online game with AI bots with the ""Unlock Lobby"" option on. That way, as the game progresses, real players can replace the bots.Also, if you can, play this game with a controller.
