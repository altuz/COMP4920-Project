Fed some fishes with half of the tribe in a first level - got the ""Mass Bathing"" achievement - funny as hell!:)The cool part - giving your guys some spears and torches and let them pick berries. Don't get ther sacrifice part so far, but getting along without magic quite well to be honest.To sum up, quite a fun, hopefully the devs will get more stuff and modes in release version, especially endless mode: I want a lot LOT LOTS of people and kill pterodactyls."

You will be clicking your way out of the deadly rhinos and sabertooth tigers, desperately trying to find some food so you don't need to eat your own tribemates, and escape the frequent bridges across the rivers (also deadly). And when your tribe safely stops for a nighttime, there are intricate text encounters waiting for you.Some minor bugs are to be expected (EA), but all in all the game is primal fun. 10 cannibals from 10."

Think an infinite runner mixed with the resource management and map travel of Oregon Trail. I paid $4.79 and feel happy with what I'm getting for the price of a burger or two."
76561198134487166,Recommended,470270,25237970,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,AR,"Its a nice game with an interesting concept. You have a tribe which constantly travels downwards. You can split and join them into a group of one, two or much more. Also you can choose to arm your people with spear, torches or bare hands. You will have to adjust your strategy quickly, for example, a large group with spears will scare off deers whereas a small one will manage to hunt it. On the contrary, if you meet a group of other people, you really should have a large group, or they will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ Overall, the game is fun, but it has some cons. It is not always easy to understand how to split your group to get a specific resource (Is it on the 7/8 of the screen? Should I split into 8? or 9? ), and you can kill everyone very easiliy by making a single mistake.  The price tag is low, buy it and try it."

So now it's time to declare, that I'm not a bit disappointed. The game is just brilliant!The art is a pure eye candy and the gameplay is addicting as hell!The controls are pretty unusual, (in a few words, you split and gather your running tribe with a mouse to grab stuff or to avoid traps), but it takes less than a minute to catch the trick.The game is full of funny details and challenging mechanics, which it won't spoonfeed to you in order not to spoil your pleasure of figuring out yourself how to eat, hunt, fight, avoid traps etc.Early access makes me hope, that the game will be even better. But even now it's definitely worth it's cost already!Я ждал эту игру уже давно, а чем больше ждёшь, тем выше требования к результату. И результат меня ни капли не разочаровал - игра просто супер!Графика радует глаз, музыка ласкает ухо, а от самой игры оторваться невозможно, затягивает!Управление довольно необычное (если вкратце, мышью разделяешь и собираешь бегущее племя и таким образом собираешь всякую всячину или избегаешь ловушек), но привыкаешь к нему практически сразу.В игре уйма забавных мелочей и механик, которые специально не разжёвываются, чтобы не лишать игрока удовольствия самостоятельного обучения еде, охоте, битвам, уворачиваниям от ловушек и т.д.Ранний доступ вселяет надежду, что игра будет ещё круче. Но уже сейчас она, вне всяких сомнений, стоит своих денег!"

,Recommended,470270,25380838,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Troctzul,"Very fun given the overall small size of the game. If there weren't so much pixel blood I'd recommend it for children, but isn't overwhelming for a young teen. I bought it on sale and would rate 4/5 because they seemed to really stretch on making it more adult for no reason at all. The game could have benefited from a little more explanation of the obstacles, but wasn't too hard to figure out that pretty much everything kills you or steals your food lol"
,Recommended,470270,29836773,Posted: 10 February,all,Ｇｌｉｔｃｈ,"Ex ""The Tribe"" e agora ""Tribe Pass"", é um jogo onde cada situação realmente importa a escolha certa. É interessante e explora a função de liderança por sua parte, na qual você emprega como um xamã da tribo e os guia através das dificuldades de explorar o mundo em busca da sobrevivência. Um game que para seu estilo está bem polido mas nada que não possa ser melhor e mais envolvente.Vale a pena a compra.Nota 6.9/10 (Sou bastante crtico vai por mim.);D"

,Not Recommended,470270,30731677,Posted: 25 March,all,provoko,Terrible controls.  The screen moving vertically ends up messing up your vision for a few minutes.  This game probably would have been better off on a phone rather than a PC with a large screen.
,Recommended,470270,33774065,Posted: 24 July,all,Samoth,"Really nice game, and nice developer too.The gameplay is simple but well developed. It has a micro component (commanding your tribe across the land) and a macro component (plan ahead the amount of food you'll use and people you'll need).You learn by trying and losing, and although guides would come in handy, you're intended to figure out the mechanincs by yourself (and the author won't spoil you much about how to deal with X or Y), so bear that in mind. I'm not a smart player when it comes to trial and error; I find the lack of guides about game mechanics a bit frustratig but hey, it's completely fair.Very good game, recommended."

But your tribe will die fast until you get how works all gameplay layers. Yep, this is not just a runner. Everyone sick about another fp2 endless and meaningless runners. But this is not a runner in common sense. Think about it as a puzzle game. Maybe it will help you to survive more than couple runs. Good luck! And don't forget to feed your tribesman."

,Not Recommended,470270,24591375,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,Caenir,"I was really looking forward to playing this game, and for the first 45 minutes it was fun. But it gets really repetitive quite fast as it's always the game enemies (understandable), and you have to go through this chat dialogue everytime you past the round, sometimes having a quest kind of thing (wish I found annoying to read as of the way it's worded). And once you past the first game, you move onto the real thing in which you have 50 days to complete (didn't say what the 50 days was four) so you end up repeating the same thing over and over and over to finish those 50 days.This is more of an opinion, as I don't normally write reviews and don't know how to do them."
