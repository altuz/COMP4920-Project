It's a bit simple at first but then gets a bit difficult (but not too difficult). I'm having a great nostalgic rush by just playing this. It gets a ""Very good!"" on the Hoovie Scale!"

76561198062381094,Recommended,470590,23431105,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,Adenzel,"Bought for and played on Linux (atm controller support is bugged but being worked on, make sure you DO NOT have your controller plugged in before or during gameplay. just leave it unplugged :P )This is a VERY simple arcade racer, and a digital recreation of racing toys that pre-date the days of computers. In my opinion the Dev nailed it and then some. Just enough of a challenge/frustration factor to keep me interested and a few surprises along the way; I was not expecting so much for so little.Also I love the sound track =D"

Simple gameplay (gear up, gear down, left and right), but really hard to master. The music is incredible too, what makes the game more amazing xD!Also, this is a GAME, plug and play. Easy as that, you dont need to get by lots of menus, or anything like that. Juts open, and race.Really really happy to find this little game. 10!"
76561198040600970,Recommended,470590,31948162,Posted: 25 May,all,Vamphaery,"SummaryAn extremely no-frills (almost, but not quite, to its detriment) modern re-imagining of vintage mechanical curved track games such as Tomy Turnin' Turbo & Sega Moto. (And if you're like me, it might also feel reminiscent to Tomytronic Thundering Turbo goggle systems.)Full Description/ReviewVery, very simple game. Three inputs. Shift up (which also initiates turbo once the meter is filled,) shift down, and left and right. That's it.The premise is to avoid other racers while fighting against the force pulling you left or right depending on which way the track leans at any given time. Survive long enough and you advance to the next race. Fail enough times, and it's game over.You can switch between different display modes. (My favorite is ""glowing,"" for the aforementioned Tomytronic Thundering Turbo goggle experience, and a fun, retro, wireframe, neon vibe. :P)RecommendationThis is a very brief, very simple game. If you pine for the purity and simplicity - which is a bit extreme in this case - of any of the aforementioned games, then this is a fantastic modern, digital take on that kind of experience. Personally, I love it. But I grew up with those games, and am someone who can value a deep, complex gaming experience, or the most barebones arcade game imaginable. This definitely falls into the latter category.There is no real ""AI"" to speak of. (Though there is some variation in opponent movement on the tracks.) This isn't a ""racing"" game, so much as a classic ""dodge the other cars and keep moving"" arcade racer.Go into this expecting that level of simplicity, and a dearth of options. It's so old school, the Start button actually... well... STARTS... not the A button!As I said, I love that personally, but it won't be for everyone.PROSThere are few if any straightforward arcade racers like this today on PC, and fewer still (this may be the only one) that specifically seek to emulate the style of those vintage mechanical games. (Before graphics as we know them even entered the scene! We're talking literal mechanical, physical machines, and at most, simple LCDs!) This game is trying to recreate that style of game design, albeit in modern 3D graphics. That makes this a very niche, unique product, and I love it for that.There is an additional unlockable mode as a reward for beating the basic Arcade mode.You can choose to see it as lacking in options, or elegant. I choose elegant.Pure, simple gameplay.CONSIf you want anything more than the above... look elsewhere.No multiplayer.Few configuration options (such as the lack of volume control.)"

,Recommended,470590,28723384,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Real,"Moto RKD dash is a tribute to the good'ol arcade games from the 80's, it also seems to be a remake from an old forgotten game & watch (which is unlockable and playable ingame), and it's also a short trip under LSD that you can get for cheap.The purists who enjoyed playing on arcade cabinets back in time will appreciate Moto RKD Dash at it's true value, although the game is short (it has only 9 levels and can be finished within 20mn), and that the gameplay doesn't vary especially during the trip, the really enjoyable aspect is that all levels have their own totally different scenery and soundtrack, which makes the game never boring. A very positive point for the trippy trance soundtracks which are of a great quality.And one very good other point is the graphic design with the choice to put the road in a perspecive vision that is very trippy and impressive at 60fps, especially on a large screen.Even if on some aspects the game looks unpolished, I would recommand it. It has a lot of replayability, especially if you are a achievement hunter or a high-score ranker. The game includes a leader board and trading cards, and one more cool thing is that the dev is very active on the community, which is a particulary good point.7/10"

The gameplay consitsts of moving the bike left or right and pressing the up and down arrows in order to shift  gears like in outrun. The level design is nice with varying levels of diffculty and objects to block your path from other bikes on the road to trucks and the sides of buildings. There is an android and ios version which plays  no different from the PC version and if  you own both a computer and a mobile phone which  most people do in this day and age I would seuggest pciking up both in order to support the developer this is a great game and I recommend it to all"

So not a lot of replay value. But at this price its hard to complain too much.Hopefully some updates will add difficulty modes or other game modes to give it a bit more replay value."
