,Not Recommended,470600,23539541,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,Phayned,"TL;DR: This ""game"" is absolute junk and I refunded. DO. NOT. BUY.I realize this game is only in EA, but as of this moment, the game is worth less than 1 €. To be honest: I would even dislike it, if I had gotten it for free.I have played it for about 30 minutes and encountered at least 12 bugs. Some major, some minor.There is just nothing I can say, that describes this game properly. You can only produce Let's Plays, the feedback for your videos is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and you can do pretty much nothing. You can literally just smash through the process of creating the video, not caring about anything at all, smash your face on the keyboard for a name and it doesn't change anything whatsoever.They try to justify this, by giving a small popup early on, explaining that they were forced to release this game as EA, because of their competitors. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t imo as well.Even the description of this game is ridiculous. They are stating, that in the next few updates, youll get useful tips. Because there is no explanation to anything yet and there isn't even a tooltip on anything.There is simply _nothing_ to do in this game and it is filled with bugs. I am 100% certain all the positive reviews have been bought by the developers.DO. NOT. BUY."

I decided it would be best to confirm the warnings now and hopefully save a few people money. With the recent success of YouTuber Life, the obvious competition they claim inspired them to go into Early Access, I knew clones would appear just as relevant clones appeared for DayZ and Five Nights At Freddys. While I understand games will be similar, the staggering void in regards to content left me concerned.The ultimate goal of the game is to become the top ""video blogger"" and dethrone clear spoofs of  well known Youtubers (such as Markiplier which is pictured using the famous mustache). You start with 500 dollars and begin buying games with one or two letters differences from the games being spoofed. This would be fine had the developer not used actual logos (DOTA symbol is sideways) and used images of official art (LoL character art for example is water smeared, but easily discernible) for video icons. You select a game to review and the equipment before waiting for the review to finish. Slender man for some reason appears and the video ends with you gaining subscribers and likes.You can upgrade your equipment and games, but you don't do much else. The main objective for subscribers is achieved by setting up a Let's Play and then doing nothing as it finishes. You also need to rest in order to review, which is done by waiting. Outside of this, there is absolutely nothing to do. This is more of a sitting simulator with no real interaction. The amount of images used for video icons that are of other properties is staggering, so maybe spend the downtime linking how many Google Maps photographs were used.Bugs are plentiful as well, including a game breaking one that made it impossible to earn money. Icons wouldn't react, sliders don't respond and some windows became stuck. This game feels, plays and looks rushed outside the character himself that at least looks decent. I am further investigating this game for any possible issues, but for now I strongly urge to avoid it all together.This message brought to you by:Early Access WatcherVideo of basic gameplay (Sorry for the slight zoom, the game failed to capture on three different capture softwares)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh8YJajwf-I"

There should be more options and hopefully more options would be available in the future.Also the game title is video blogger story but it seems to just be about youtube gaming/review. Where is the daily vlogging?

A lot of the screen is dead space, the graphics look like I drew them and the U.I is at best baffling. There feels like there is very little direction or guidance going on.The Youtube (or Utube comments) are even more idiotic and nonsensical than in real life.... has something been lost in translation?I'm afraid that I cannot bring myself to persevere with it any further after playing it for about 10 minutes. I know that people will say that I haven't given it a chance... but I really do not have the will to struggle any further with it. This is my free time and I want to spend it doing something I enjoy - namely, not playing this game.It is the worst game I have encountered on Steam and I feel rather cheesed off that I paid nearly £5 for a gamethat looks, feels and plays like I designed it whilst drunk in a bad mood.Perhaps it will get a lot of work done to it and it will be okay... as it is, keep well clear friends, it is a stinker !"

Even finding out how to earn more money is an exercise in patience and googling.From the Dev's statements, it looks like their decision to present in early access was due to some 'competition', which makes sense if you have a decently worked game...  However this just FEELS incredibly rushed and I have a feeling that their decision to release early will do much more harm to them than having a competetor release before them, but developing a solid game."

There could have been a comment section interaction menu rather than just""here's what some♥♥♥♥♥♥said on your Outlast #464646252 video""so basically there could've been a choice and consequences sort of thing. Choose to apologise over a joke you said, choose to grill the person for being offended, send your fans after someone and just make youtube drama and then do reply videos.Speaking of humor though - How did they miss the chance to choose what your style of humor is? So set your humor from nursery poopy jokes to really dark humor and then that can creat your target audience.So much stuff missed out and I don't think the devs will add anything to this so that's why even thought the game is in early access, i'm going to treat it like a full game. If something new comes up that actually transforms it from being a Game Dev Tycoon clone, I'll play again.Having said all that though... yeah, still relaxing to play but i've got other stuff in my library so i'm only giving it a recommendation based on its relaxing to play value."

I will say that I'm glad this is an Early Access game because it's still missing alot, I'm not talking about the menu items that are grayed out. I'm talking about right now it's still missing something. While it is entertaining, it can get a bit boring after making your 20th video.As stated in one of the post, you must buy a game before you can create a video, yes this makes sense but in the game there wasn't anything that said buy a game first, it took me awhile to get past this.Once you get past the 100 subscribers (level 1) more things start to happen, like sponsors and other bloggers connecting to you, but level 2 is then 10000 subscribers.. uh? wow I got up to +2K and started to get a little bored with my options.https://youtu.be/iBaXYWe8Pfk"

Not cartoony and not a lot of running around, focus on making good choices and videos. I own ""You Tubers Life"" as well and this is a nice twist and good game so far. Go get em guys!There is no tutorial but if you click on the shop and browse around a bit, its not hard at all to figure out.It was fun, the comments you can review and the content and possibilities are really broad.Help this small group I say, and let them give the others in the genre a run.Great work so far, framrate is excellent and the replayability is there too. Can't wait to see how this develops.Cons;Sound is the same for every video you make funny or not.Needs more graphics and thus far havent left my room.Your guy auto sleeps even if at full energy.Other than that for Early Access; they are on a great track from a Dev standpoint and content thus far that is fully operational.Solid support buy!"
