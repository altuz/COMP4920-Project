As someone who actually uses heavy equipment every day, I keep finding details that make me go "" What the ****, this is NOT how it actually works!!!!!""The good:No foremen to yell at you.No laborers to get in your way.No paperwork to fill out.No waiting around for hours for certain things to happen.You can take your sweet time getting the job done.Cons:Physics engine is junk.Some of the equipment is based on European models. Why use a cabover dump truck and lorry, yet your grocery getter is a ford raptor? Where does this game take place? I've seen some of the exact same vehicle models in other games, so they are either open source or taken directly from other games.Where are the pendant lines and hoist rope on the crawler crane?Dirt should not just go *poof* when you run into it...you have to push it around.Frankly the graphics suck for a game released in 2016, especially for the load this game puts on my graphics card.The UI is confusing. The map icons are too small, can't be resized.This is a 5 dollar game, not 15 or 20. And it's an arcade game, not a simulator. It's still fun, but calling it a simulator is insulting to other games that accurately simulate their real world counterparts."

XDI honestly was just trying it out to see if they've be able to figure it out, but ended up spending nearly 4 hours playing it so far!Game play is straight forward and controls are both intuitive and on screen in a nonobtrusive manner for people who need them. It's relatively simple and somehow oddly relaxing."
76561198068135337,Recommended,470740,26148936,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,[BS] Fridge Lord,"It's more of a hybrid genre game somewhere between Action-Casual and Simulation, not necessarily a pure simulator.  However, if you enjoy the theme and subject matter, it's some pretty good relaxing casual fun.I do think the game's description and how it presents its gameplay in its trailer should be tweaked a little bit.  This is not really a pure sandbox, as the goals and progression are very directed and sequential, not open-ended.  It's also not that close to a pure simulator- there are numerous constraints and limitations on your activity and gameplay mechanics, invisible walls, etc.However, if you take it for what it is, an Action-Casual/Simulator hybrid, it's actually a really fun game & executes its purpose very well.If you're expecting something on the level of Farming Simulator, you're going to be disappointed.  That's simply not what it is.But if you're a fan of the theme and you like going through progressions, go ahead and get it, you'll have a good time."

76561198044060889,Not Recommended,470740,30150671,Posted: 24 February,all,Gigoveth,"Where do I start.First of all - it is not a sandbox. Sandboxes do not have any set end. In this game your last ""mission"" is to build an office building. End of story.Secondly it is but a short campaign - you get missions that start with the acquisition of a campsite, and you end with the aforementioned office building. With some wooden sheds etc in the meantime. Much better is the demolition work, but as mentioned above - it ends quickly with the game informing you that you should take vacation. Not a sandboxy stuff at all.Third point - there is no way of replaying it. It is simply too tedious. For me the proverbial final nail in the coffin was... my excavator getting stuck in some pipes on a derelict oil refinery site (the size of this refinery is similar to an average sized KFC or Burgerking. Of course - I could have ""summoned"" the excavator again via parking sign - but it is not the point. Game has its glitches. Some of the most annoiying is the traffic. Just imagine - you summon your, say, truck. It appears in the middle of the road and all incoming cars ram into it. Kamikaze? Also - sites where are located buildings that are about to be demolished are full of materials that you are not allowed to touch as it will break them and will cost you some money. Sounds fair? Not really. Especially when you think that you are not able to even scratch surrounding buikldings using a crane with a wrecking ball. So there are 2 missions on the same site. On the first one you demolish a building, on the second you have to demolish 4 chimneys. Of course the chimneys cannot be scratched during the first mission.4th think - physics. My oh my. I have certainly learned new things about physics owing to this game...And the list of such great ideas goes on and on.So better to looks for another gme."
,Not Recommended,470740,33047110,Posted: 30 June,all,RyzenThunder,Has lots of loading screens and is very poorly optimized. The demolition jobs are very small and you spend more time driving to your location then actually demolishing things.
,Not Recommended,470740,31918417,Posted: 23 May,all,GarfieldKitty,"it was a bit fun at the start, but later into the game it got pretty boring here is why-you start doing the exact same jobs over and over, pick up this, destroy that, TAKE OUT THE BLIZZIN TRASH no im srs-the game makes you basicly farm until you have the cash for the thing you need to do the main job-it takes WAY to long to get places and getting there is like haveing a 2 year old gide you using a phisical map-takes WAAAAAAAAAAAY to long to do anythingso yeah. But there are some good parts of the game-the graphics are goodish-the phisics engine is apperently pretty good-and the tutorial guy is helpful MOST of the timeso there you go, it's not worth your 20 hard earned bucks or 10 hours of your time(thats how long it took me to finish the game, i never toched it since)"

You spend hours cobling together small amounts of money to buy vehicles and equipment which the game strictly forces you to use in a way not dissimilar to putting pegs in a hole.

The destruction in this game is much more fun than the construction, but it is overall a very entertaining experience. Very few bugs considering the price/budget."
,Recommended,470740,26187263,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Limmin,"Game plays quite well.  Looks decent, runs smoothly, and some aspects of the demolition are surprisingly fun.  Using a wrecking ball on an old brick building was a blast!It's more ""arcadish"" than a sim.  Which is nice in that it's less work and grind than some of the more realistic sims I've played.Downside:  There are a few nitpicks here and there but nothing game breaking.I think it's a nice balance, and feel good about the experience at the price I paid (~$15)."

The gameplay is slow which is something you may have to get used to if you're unfamiliar with this kind of experience, however I see it as more relaxing than anything. As for the physics, I'd say it’s okay, things mostly break the way they're supposed to with the occasional strange behaviour.The radio is a blessing as you will be driving around a fair amount in the game and taking in the environment, which in my opinion is not up to standard for a game released in 2016 but not totally horrible.I was not a big fan of the UI, things just seem to be cluttered around the place, also using fraps to record gameplay the game did crash a fair amount of times which is never a good thing.Overall I’d say the game is okay if you enjoy slow paced games. It's also not completely polished which is guess is reflected in its price."

The contracts do get a bit repetitive but it's not enough to make simulation fans get bored.

Is Demolish & Build 2017 a ""simulator""...as others have commented not to the level of those other games.  It's more of a simplified version but none the less it is really a fun game so far.  I'm a little concerned at this point because i'm only 2.7 hours in and already at 36% so length of the game may be relatively short.  The graphics are decent, no high end details but I think they're just fine and my geforce gtx1070 has no issues at all running it on ""ultra"" settings.  The audio is decent although I had to kill the radio and the lack of noise when tossing things in a trash can bothers me but the sound of smashing concrete is great.  If you've play construction simulator and enjoyed it i think you'd enjoy this game, it's far more basic and heck, smashing stuff is always fun!  Would recommend if on sale!"

This is the first one that is a great balance of simulation and arcade-like fun.  The reason for playing construction games is because my sons love construction trucks.  The other simulators are tedious and time consuming (partly because its simulation-focused). Demo and Build 2017 is the first game where the kids are engaged throughout the game play.A few things I'm (and my sons) are looking forward to is to have more vehicles and attachments/extensions for those vehicles.  For me, it would be great if they added a gamepad (xbox controller) support.Overall, this is a fun construction game. Great for adults and kids."
