,Recommended,470780,33546258,Posted: 14 July,all,phrounz,"Bought it (in sale) for the fascinating visuals, stayed for the rest.It's very good in every aspect: visuals, music, narrative and gameplay. The game is not easy, but with some skill gained from previous levels, some deep cogitation, and a bit of trial-and-error and accustomation to the current level, one can reach the end. The story is interesting, even if, like the rest of the game, it's a bit mysterious and not easy to get at first.In addition, I played the game on two computers on two different places, and thanks to the Steam Cloud support my saves were kept, and the game ran not super smoothly but okay enough on the ""not powerful"" machine I though would not be able to run this in the first place. Very appreciable."

Step after step, the difficulty increases, then when you managed to master the first type of challenge, every few levels a new twist is added. (The principle of all the puzzles is some kind of variation of the riddle with the river, the fox, the cabbage, the goose, the farmer and the boat; but in later levels much more complicated and demanding.) This is done so perfectly, that, in fact, the game never gets boring, no, quite the opposite is true, you slowly become addicted: just one more, just one more... If you manage to solve a level, you feel deeply satisfied.So, you have a kind of game, you've probably played many, many times before, but here something rare happened, it is executed just perfect.What makes it escpecially beautiful is the fantastic art style and the surreal ""story"".This game gives you even more than it might look like to you!"

The puzzles have appropriate difficulties, the visuals are amazing, the music and sound design is simple but atmospheric, charming and very effective.The only negatives I would say is that some people may consider it too short, some of the achievements have strange requirements and it isn't quite clear how the story fits with the puzzles.I would reccomend to any fan of puzzle games."

'trying for whimsy' at times, and overall quite good. Worth playing if you want a simple, but challenging puzzle game with a lot of character."

,Recommended,470780,29600232,Posted: 30 January,all,Guy,It feels designed for a tablet. Reminds me a bit of the beauty and puzzles of Monument Valley.
,Recommended,470780,29451019,Posted: 23 January,all,jennarosity,I really enjoy puzzles and obstacles games so when I was shown this game I was really interested in it. It was a great game with beautiful artwork. I liked all the characters as well as the underlying story. The only thing I am sad about is that I finished it in 6 hours. I hope that there will be more levels added or new acts. I look forward to the next game!
,Recommended,470780,29514505,Posted: 26 January,all,ToweringManiac,Well designed puzzles are complemented by the very nice visuals and minimal but soothing soundtrack. She Remembered Capterpillars isn't a complicated game but it makes up for that by just being really well made top to bottom.

After actualy purchasing the game and starting to run through it, I'm glad to say that it has exceeded the already high hopes I had for it when initially test playing it. I love the music and the simplicity of the mechanics combined with the complexity of the puzzles. Would highly recommend for anyone that enjoys puzzle games."

,Recommended,470780,32969328,Posted: 28 June,all,Oori,"Played the demo first hand during Casual Connect back in 2016 and immediately fell in love with the puzzle and the mysterious narrative behind the game.If you like hard puzzle games, then this is the game for you because it get's quite hard progressively. Also what not to love of the little bouncy characters <3"
,Recommended,470780,33448571,Posted: 10 July,all,Frostilyte,"A visually interesting and well designed set of 40 logic puzzles, which almost gets away with teaching the player the game's rules entirely without words. It isn't the most involved puzzle game I've played, but it was nice to play through for the 4 hours it lasted while listening to the game's ambient soundtrack. I found it a really enjoyable bite sized experience and would recommend giving it a look if you enjoy logic puzzles."

76561198005657127,Recommended,470780,30519186,Posted: 14 March,all,shoryukenftw,"This is a wonderfully animated, beautiful, atmospheric game with a complimentary ethereal soundtrack and some enjoyable puzzles.  I'm not a huge fan of puzzle games, but I really enjoyed this one.  I was pulled in by the stellar animation and not disappointed.  As the stages progressed in difficulty it got to a point in the early 30's where I was having much less fun,  but even then I appreciated the challenge and soldiered on through the last few levels to 40.Hats off to the game designers, they made a lot of wonderful choices when making this game.  I love the simplicity of controls.  The only UI in each stage is a simple menu button to let you focus on the puzzle.  It's simple, small, well placed, and blends into the background while still being easy to find if you want it.  While I'm not colorblind, I do think the game's design benefited from pairing colors and shapes together.New mechanics are subtly introduced throughout the game without needing a tutorial or a constant reminder to push X button (The Last Guardian I'm looking at you).  The only time they really break this teaching by exploration is when you can merge and split gammies.  I completely agree with their decision as I don't think most people would have been able to figure that out.  I hate starting a new game and being forced to play a tutorial and memorizing an overcomplicated control scheme.  I also hate games that won't unlock their core mechanices until an hour or more into the game.  She Remembered Catapillars does a fantastic job at giving you the core mechanics right away, without handholding, and then subtily building on them throughout the game.  I wish more games took their approach and executed it well.  Again,  great game design.The story is brief and encourages lots of interpretation.  In essance it's about a daughter dealing with the death of her estranged father.  Honestly, lots of it doesn't make much sense to me.  It's kept short enough to not detract from the game though.  The story is quite puzzling, and I'm not interested in trying to unravel its meaning.  It seems fitting a puzzle game would have a puzzling story.  I bet others will have some interesting theories on what it all means, since it seems like the game has plenty of figurative allusions and symbolisms.  It would be nice to have a menu option unlock after beating things so you can see just the story on its own.  Maybe then I could make more sense of it.  Somehow it feels like the puzzles are taking place in your father's brain, but maybe I'm just reading into things too much.I feel the art direction of the backgrounds helped convey what the girl in the story was going through in a very abstract way.  [slight spoilers in the paragraph] In act 1 things start small while the story speaks of childhood.  Other sections seem diseased and decaying.  It then has a mechanical, almost surgical influance.  The hands in act 5 could symbolize trying to hold on to life, or having it slip away.  Act 7 feels empty and full of loss.  Life has gone.  Act 8 has the most gorgeous, abundant background of them all, showing rebirth, renewal, and perhaps acceptance of loss with the recovery that takes place afterwards.All in all it's a very well made game that strays from the tired zombie/crafting/FPS games flooding the market.  Check out the demo and see if it's your cup of tea."

76561198066510407,Recommended,470780,34463708,Posted: 24 August,all,Littlefish,"This is one of my favorite games now.Simple premise, intuitive puzzle game with a mature story (not GTA mature; Majora's Mask mature)Beautiful art direction.Perfectly designed puzzles, not too easy, but easily accessible and never too difficult or obtuse to solve.I played the demo, and liked it, but thought ""great, but where could they possibly go from here?""After buying the full game, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see how masterfully they built upon the game's core mechanics; to say the demo scratches the surface would be an overstatement. It's still definitely worth a play, though.I really hope they release a level pack or a sequel or something. Even without a story."
