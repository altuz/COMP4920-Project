76561197993423353,Recommended,471330,31560966,Posted: 5 May,all,TinyTestTackle,"I'm digging this game. The game play is very simple. You're tasked with defending your camp from waves of zombies. You can play either alone or with up to 4 people. I've only played single player. You last as long as you can before you either die or a zombie breaches the gate to your camp.At the start of the game you have a set amount of coins that you can spend on your initial defense. You get walls, sentries, damaging barriers like razor wire, a few exploding items like a landmine or a exploding gas canister. Once you get it set up the way you think will work best you start the round and the zombies start coming.When you kill zombies you get XP that can be spent on perks that give you boosts. The zombies also drop power ups and weapons and coins. Once you clear a wave you get another build phase and you can spend whatever coins you had left or gathered during the wave to add to your defense.The replayability comes from global high score leaderboards and persistent player progression in the form of ranks. Each rank up gives you a permanent perk point that you can spend on a perk that will always be active when you start a game. There are 8 ranks. At 5 hours of gameplay I'm currently rank 4.Beyond ranks there are also multiple classes to choose from and RPG style character attributes. For example you can take a few points from speed and put them health or damage.And the reason I recommend the game is that when I first started getting to wave 5 was a big deal, then it was wave 10 and now I can get to wave 15 fairly regularly. But the guys on top of the leaderboard are doing like wave 50 or something so I know I've got lots of room to improve and new defensive ideas to try out.And when you're on a roll and starting to approach your current high score and you're nearly being overrun by zombies, things get intense. When that perfectly timed med kit hits you can help but think ""Oh thank god!"". Or when a fire bomb powerup drops and you can use it to blast away the zombies that are beating your last remaining sentry.if you like top down wave shooters you'll get your money's worth."

Also even balanced for Singleplayer and Multiplayer+ Music and soundeffects are good and fit right in the game.+ The Controls are like at Nation Red, easy to understand and use (Only played Keyboard+Mouse)+ Many different weapon types and perks+ Snowbrigade, the Developer of the Game, is very enthusiastic and keeps in touch with the community for new ideas and improvements, thats a big plus for me personally.Neutral~ The Character customization option is a nice gimmick, but there arent really many different outfit options to choose from, (currently on 2 for each ""body region"")  this sure requires some work and new ideas.~ I personally dont mind, but i think there also should be the possiblitiy to use female characters, like at Nation Red.~ The autoperk selection screen is confusing for me, it shows red and white after clicking a perk, but you can only guess if red  or white means you selected a perk.~At the moment the playerbase is very small, but i guess thats because the game just came out :)~ Another minor thing: the steam leaderboard is not accessible for me, i can only see achievements on steam, and the leaderboard in game.~Not many Maps to play on~ I miss the Player Rank icon from nation red, the singleplayer ""campain""~Multiplayer seems to have some sync issues, i died a few times without even seeing what hit meNegative- There is no difficulty option anymore.- The Game freezes and stops responding when you ALT+TAB out of the game, had to learn that the hard way.-sidenote: i miss my good old ak47-//Overall i would say the game is fun.I had to get used to it after Nation red, but then its surely addicting.On the other hand, for people who arent as hooked as some of us NR addicts, it probably gets boring after a few hours cause there is not much gameplay variety. and the small playerbase.The Price is fair, when you inform yourself BEFORE BUYING and consider  that Snow will add new things and update and improve the game, like he did with his last game."

I am not thrill by human enemies though like madmax :) it will be even more amazing if it was zombie or alien enemies but for now it is very fun to play and I love it. Can't wait to see future development.
,Recommended,471330,26237868,"Posted: 26 October, 2016",all,Seiseki,"As a longtime fan of Nation Red, there wasn't any hesitation whether I should buy this game or not.The developer has a wonderful connection to the community and Nation Red received frequent updates, adding more content and improving things, directly based on player feedback from the steam forums.I have no doubt things will be the same with Versus.That being said, this game is a bit different from Nation Red.Some things I like, other things, not as much.The glorious mayhem and destruction from Nation Red is the same.There are perks, powerups, weapons, boss zombies, etc.The graphics now have this smudged painted look, along with outlines.I like how rough and grimy it is, but the levels suffer a bit from things blending together. I like night time the most because zombies stand out very clearly towards the background.The visual effects can get a bit overwhelming though, as it gets harder to figure out what is going on.The powerup effects and such can easily get drowned in the flood of various effects, this applies to the sound effects as well. The level up effect which is quite important is also easy to miss in the ensuing chaos.A really cool and unexpected feature was how you can customize your character visually.Right now there's only toggling on and off various clothing and accessories, but I'm hoping to see additional gear in the future.I really like the building mechanics, but I wish the maps had more inherent and larger obstacles to take advantage of.The controls in the build mode confused me at first as I tried to swap between using a mouse and the controller.Once I got the hang of it, using only the controller, the only issue was the sensitivity of the analogue stick when placing things.The thing I like the least has to be ammunition.I like the idea, but in practice it's frustrating. When you run out it usually means you lose.And there's various kinds of ammunition making it even more confusing.When you play, you just want to mow down hordes of zombies, the quick paced action doesn't go well with the idea of conserving and keeping track of your ammo.I've always thought the best thing about Nation Red was the perks and especially Random Perk mode.Each time you level up you'd get to select from a handful of random perks, because it's random you'd usually go with a different build each time, which added great replayability and you'd change your style of play depending on the perks.This hasn't changed in Versus.But Auto-perk mode is the default one and I'm sure new players won't bother to change it, which I think is bad as a new player won't even know how it works or what perks are.I guess I have to write something at the end here, huh..If you like building barricades and mowing down hordes of zombies. Get this game!"

Just 30 mins in and I already know the first game these guys made Nation Red was out done by a large amount!  The first game I admit was a lot easier and that's why this game is better on one level because it’s difficult!!They have updated the original with a new terrain customization to allow the player their own personal spin on how a scenario can be better; want more sentries, med kits, hand grenades, walls, explosive canisters, etc?  DONE!!  You can now customize even the soldier themselves!!!!I know these guys are going to go places, they take something great and make it amazing.  Keep up the excellent work!"

76561198040837514,Recommended,471330,26394505,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,Brudda,"""Versus Game"" is an excellent top-down, arcade, twinstick shooter.  Definitely a must have if you're into this genre or wanting to get into it.The combat mechanics are fairly standard nothing gimmicky or that sort.  There are small handful of maps to choose from.  Once the level opens you have a set amount of money to build defenses against the horde of enemies.  There are two types of objectvies survive as long as you can or prevent breaching of a point.There are classes you can choose, each with their own stat specialty.  There is appearance customization with armor pieces, as of now there are only two options for various armor parts.  You can also pick primary and secondary weapons that you always go into battle with, but you can find additional weapons during a match.A downside to the game is the lack of weapons, there isn't enough of a variety, same with outfit customization.  Definitely would like to see more.Overall the game is good.  A great game to play in short bursts whenever you're bored or need to satisfy that shooting itch.  You will definitely get your money's worth."
,Recommended,471330,33746792,Posted: 23 July,all,Syntax Error,"A follow-up to the excellent Nation Red is a tricky thing. Sometimes a bowl of deliciously simple ice cream isn't improved upon by adding a pile of whipped cream, sprinkles and other toppings.  And Versus Squad doesn't quite find the right balance but you still wind up with a pretty good dessert.The premise is simple: A twin-stick shooter where you mow down waves of zombies in a never-ending endurance fight.  Weapons and power-ups abound and you gain selectable perks as you progress.  Versus Squad adds a defense element by allowing the player to purchase and place walls, fences, sentry turrets, explosives and other items to protect themselves and funnel the zombie hordes.  Unfortunately, the defense part didn't always seem to make the game better.  In my first game, it bugged out and locked up the game (that hasn't happened since).  In other games, no one had enough coins to do much between waves. The UI is clunky which just adds to disrupting the flow of the game.  There's also a survival mode where you place items once and then fight continuously without wave breaks.Although I didn't think the defense aspects were entirely ready for prime time, the game itself remains solid and the other improvements are nice: you can earn points to buy permanent perks, the graphics are much improved and the game still feels solid.  It's not a bad game by any stretch; it's a pretty good one.  But the new elements need some more tweaking to match the simple beauty of Nation Red.  Fortunately the developers remain involved in updating the game and I expect good things for it."

,Recommended,471330,34266636,Posted: 15 August,all,|GA|HSMagnet,"Versus Squad is an amazing follow up to Nation Red.Both are ""Twin Stick Shooters"". In a twin stick control scheme, one stick controls the player character's movement while the other stick controls the aiming of the weapon. this control scheme allows fast responses to targets in 360°s. it is especially convenient for consoles and associated controllers. this control scheme became popular with the blockbuster game ""Robotron 2084""the ability to  take diarama arena sandboxs and modify then in preparation for the hordes of enemies to come adds to the aspect of trying different tactics. there are several choices in the build phase as well. repair of defenses is possible in game during the ""Build Phase""the player may carry two weapos at a time. one active and one secondary. it is possible to ""lock"" weapons you wish to keep. during gameplay different weapons may spawn and unless your weapons are locked, one will be replaced. this can be a boon if it is a bettrer weapon or a hindrance if is worse.this ia a fast paced shooter that requires good movement skill in addition to good aiming skill.there is much, much more about this game.

76561198006894941,Recommended,471330,33440351,Posted: 10 July,all,Gotgo,"Versus Squad: An addiction in a nutshell.I bought Versus Squad during the summer sale with the notion that it would be a “fun 4 dollar game”, but it turned out to be a lot more than that.Versus Squad is one of those games that can easily become an addiction. From the outside looking in the game might seem repetitively simple. “Build Here. Kill Here. Die Here.”, is how games like this normally are and once you establish that the game can become stagnant fast. Versus Squad isn't like that. While this game isn't overly complex it does have enough complexity to keep you playing.If you're interested in the array of things that make this game what it is then I will point you in another direction.All of the basics can be found here!If you're interested in the positives and negatives of those things then continue on in this review.Positives:• The Perk System plays a large part in how the game will progress for the player. As the game progresses you're able to choose Perks to help you fight off the attackers. In the end(if you survive long enough)you might be able to get most of the Perks in game. Choosing the right Perks in the right order that fits your play style is what will help get you there.• Defenses are a very large part of the game and the main reason I keep coming back. The map is a Sandbox and how you set your defense up will directly impact how long you last. There is always room to improve upon your failed attempts.• The game plays smoothly. The rolling. The shooting. The running. The surviving. All of these things match together perfectly and brings an overall enjoyable feel to the game.• It's a great COOP game. Playing this game with 3 other people is a hoot. I don't know how to praise it enough. If you like playing with friends then you will like this game.• Achievements can keep the game interesting. If you're interested in Achievements like me then you will be happy to know this game has some fun ones. Take a gander through the Achievement list to see for yourself.• The Dev actually interacts with the community. They actually listen, communicate, and try to fix the problems that the community faces. I think this says a lot for a game.  Take a scroll on over to the Steam Forums for this game to see what I mean.Negitives:•The game can be buggy.In the 25 hours I've played I've yet to run into anything game breaking. There are bugs that range from a minor inconvenience to flat out annoying.Not being able to place Defenses down for a wave is the one I most commonly run into.If bugs completly ruin a game for you then they might ruin this one.• The game is dead. There is no good way to put this. I can make a few public matches over the course of a few hours and wont have a single person join. Than other times it will fill all the way up by wave 2. Sometimes there wont be a game up for seemingly hours, but other times there will be a few. If the main reason you're buying this is for the COOP then I highly recommend you convince a friend to get it or are at least willing to actively look for people to play with.• It can get repetitive. I wont lie and say this game will keep you entertained for months on end. That is just the nature of games like this. The only difference is that this game lasts longer than most.• The menu controls are clunky. Navigating through the menus isn't the best experience around. It can be confusing at times and a little frustrating at others.• The connection type is Peer 2 Peer. I don't see this so much as a negative, but something that is just worth mentioning. If you've played any other game that is Peer 2 Peer you will know what it's like to play this.Conclusion:Simply put this game is fun and is well worth the money. If you can pick it up on sale even better. If you can convince friends to get it then hot damn you're golden. While getting into a match(finding people and navigating the menus)can sometimes be a burden once you get into the match be ready for 30+ minutes to just sail on by. I mean I've put more time into this little game than most AAA titles I buy during sales. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Sandbox Twin Stick Shooter. Heck even people who like Tower Defense would like this game."
76561197998740996,Recommended,471330,29546969,Posted: 28 January,all,~Ren~,"This is the sequel by the same developer that released Nation Red, if you know that game or already own it then you should already know what type of support that game was given over many years.The object of the game is simple, kill everything either as a solo player or with up to 3 other players/friends in coop.You have one of five different character classes to choose from, medic, assault, scout, sniper and scavenger.  Each class has their own powerup skill and their class attributes can be set up specific to your playstyle or your team.  You can also change your player look with customisation.The game has different ranks ranging from recruit right up to master with each new rank giving you an option of a starting perk.You have a large number of weapons in the game including shotguns and assault rifles or if you need something with more power you also have a grenade launcher that fires upto 8 high explosive rounds in a matter of seconds.  Still need extra firepower?  Jump on a sentry gun or use one of the automated sentry guns to give you or your team backup.To survive the onslaught or maybe go for a high score on the leaderboards you'll need perks to do that, these are earned during a game with experience points (xp) by killing zombies or bosses.  Perks range from faster firing speed, more weapon damage to health regeneration, etc.When you kill a zombie or a boss you'll also get powerup drops, these last for a short time but can clear an entire battlefield in seconds, rage and clusterbombs are two such powerups but you have many more.Along with regular zombies you will also face upto 10 bosses in the same game, these are much stronger and more dangerous than regular zombies, a chainsaw boss on his own is not much of a threat, add in a tank boss, gatling gun boss, mortar boss and rotor boss to the battle and you will soon see why perks and powerups are needed to survive longer.You have different game modes available to play along with different maps to play on and a choice of difficulty levels.  The game modes are free play, tactical, survival or if you want to increase the challenge go for resource mode, this is limited ammunition which is replaced with powerups, miss a powerup and you could find yourself out of ammunition when you need it the most.If you're playing tactical mode you can build barricades to keep the horde away from the breach area, these range in cost and can be bought with coins that drop when you kill a zombie or a boss, the barricades also use different material, wood, concrete, metal and razorwire to name some available.  These barricades can be damaged during play but in tactical mode they can also be replaced or repaired.The game supports upto 4 player coop.Since release this game has been updated several times, from basic bug fixes to new additions to the game, new bosses, new weapons, new achievements, etc. more on the way too."

,Recommended,471330,29998109,Posted: 17 February,all,Therieri,"I'm big fan of Shoot ''em up with Twin Stick Shooter. I've played them since my childhood. My favorite games was Alien Phobia series (1, 2 and 3) and Crimsonland. Nation Red was like Crimsonland but just much better in every way possible. This could be called sequal for it since it's made by same guy.Versus Squad is game which is made by one guy who listens players. Even though this is not in early access game is ever evolving. New thing come from time to time. If you don't believe me check recent updates!Game idea is to build defenses (barricades and/or turrets) against rioters. You will die in time but your goal is to take as many of them with you as possible and then get good score. There is leaderboards so you want to get always better and better score... or just have fun!There is two modes with limited or unlimited ammo. Modes are tactical where rioters come in waves and you can spend money to defenses between waves. Money drops from rioters but it is limited so it's recommended to use it wisely. Ammo also drops from rioters. There is seperate leaderboards for all of them.You can play these gamemodes in one of three different difficulties: easy, normal and hard. What bigger difficulty that more you get experience points (which is also your score). So if you want faster game you might want to play in higher difficulty. If you want long you want easy difficulty.You use these experience points to get perks which your playing easier but sometimes also more high risk, high reward. Like as example you take more damage but also get more XP per kill.I personally like this game. This kind of games always have special place in my life and I have to say this is best of that category. Even though might can say this kind of game is boring I don't think so. It's refreshing to try to get good score and stay alive as long as possible."

,Recommended,471330,33620139,Posted: 17 July,all,Cmdr. Perrin,"From the creators of one of my favorite topdown shooters, Nation Red, comes Versus Squad. This game is an improvement on Nation Red in many ways. The new enemies are epic, the guns are great, and the maps are well made. The perk system is well made much like the first game, with Perk Modes dictating how you recieve them in-game. New to the series is the ability to gain ""Perk Credits"" by leveling up your character. Perks bought with these stay with you in-between games unlike normal perks, which reset after every attempt. The most important new feature is the ability to build. You and your squad can build barricades and turrets, among other defensive items, on the map either before playing or in-between waves depending on the game mode you choose. These things along with the constant updates and very responsive dev makes Versus Squad a must have for people who love topdown shooters. Be warned though, while fun in single-player the game is intended for (and thus 100x more fun with) other people. So if you can grab some friends that are willing to buy this game and play it. And while you are at it get Nation Red. It is an older game, lacking some of the features of Versus Squad, but it is still very fun and includes a little mini-storymode of single-player levels. Nation Red also have and amazing multi-player so you can pick and choose, or do what I did and buy both."

76561198020110237,Recommended,471330,26249835,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,Stevoid,"Review Update: 24th June 2017Players can now actively drop in and there is now a game mode that allows you to build between waves. Snow is an amazing developer and has a very keen interest in taking on board criticism from his players, if you ever have problems with the game just post on the forum and Snow will always respond, very friendly person and an amazing game.Disregard everything below as it is now fixed and/or present in the game.===================================================================This game is great in everyway. It's a lot of fun getting to higher waves the carnage is insane and gets your heart pumping.My only real complaint is players can't actively drop into your game they can only join when you're in lobby. The developer has mentioned this will be fixed in the following week so I am really excited for that.If you have played Nation Red before, it's very very similar except you can build defenses at the beginning of the game (turrets, walls, pickups etc).I would also like to see a game mode that lets you build between waves. Perhaps money pickups that enemies or bosses drop between waves and then can be used at the end of waves. I'm not sure how you could balance this out so you don't end up with 50 turrets nearly one shotting bosses (perhaps restrictions of how many can be on a map at a single time) or maybe you can only build every 5 or 10 waves. but I'd like to see it one day.Overall a great game and would recommend it to anyone :)"

It improves over nation red a 100 times, without removing anything at all!For those of you who've never played, I highly recommend it. You'll only play this game about 30-45 minutes at a time, but you'll find yourself playing it every single day for years.It also is really well optimised! Even more so then nation red!So GET IT GET IT GET IT."

Now it fixed !A while ago after some update, we can kill team mate. Now it fixed !and it doesn't limit to that, some improvement that people said to it dev make it happens !A while ago people want a repair system. Now it's there !A while ago people want new boss. Now it's there ! (last added boss was The Tank)A while ago people want new gun, dev said he/she will add (coming soon new gun), Yay !and many other dev did or will be done...Dev really open to suggestions, what else there to say, you like to see something in the game just said it, dev will listen if most people like it and fit the game !It definitely worth for its price, esp when have some discount at it, i would even pay twice its normal price now if i knew it will be this super fun game.I mostly play for coop/online but for single player it also have some fun in it, depends on what's more to your likey.Don't forget you can free to suggest what is more to your likey, if it fits it will be there !"

Once picking up a dropped weapon you could not switch back to your previous weapon.

The menu music gave me a headache waiting in lobby for my friend to start the thing, the combat was the most boring♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever slogged through, and putting up defenses felt like a chore. Nothing is explained, it's just given to you with the expectation that you'll do the labor and make the game yourself.The maps are bland because you're expected to make them.They're smallThe guns feel like they don't even register as a hit 50-60 percent of the time, and when they do, it's far from satisfying.Lack of ammunition means no penalties for spraying and praying- which is exactly what you'll do with every weapon. Every single one. No work, no tactical nature to it. Just walk around and spray in the general direction of the enemies.Look, dev, I know you tried your best here but it's just not good."
