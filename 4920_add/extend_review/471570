The puzzles themselves are fun to solve and even though it could take more than one try or even quite a few, the calm music would most likely stop you from raging.It's a great game to play when you just want to relax, enjoy puzzles and feel peaceful with the remnants of your grandfather.Edit:There's no steam cloud save implemented so don't uninstall it or you'll lose your progress :)"

You slide around like colored squares on a board and have them match up. This version has a lot of similar ideas to others I've played in the past, and it has a couple of new ideas, which is good.  What I like most about this variant is that the number of moves you make doesn't matter. This is always a source of frustration for me whenever I play these games when they demand you solve the puzzle in the fewest amount of moves to get 3 stars.Where this game excels is in its polish. The graphics are crisp and the game feels great. However, what I like best is the beautiful piano tracks playing in the background. It makes for a very relaxing experience while working your brain.Overall, very highly recommended if you like these types of puzzle games."

With its very rich atmosphere, skillfully designed puzzles and timely introduced gameplay elements, Grandpa's Table is definitely one of the puzzle games that I enjoy playing for a while and going back to when I feel like.The very atmospheric main menu says long on the overall quality of the game and perfectionism of its (charming, judging by the credits) two developers. Drinking some in-game coffee while playing with light effects on a georgeous 3D wooden table is just a blast - even better when also drinking real-life coffee and listening to Grandpa's Table's awesome music.Gameplay wise, it's just great. There is some good difficulty for people who are got at puzzles, but it's not overly hard and people who don't want too great a challenge can also easily skip some puzzles, or solve them without grabbing all stars if they're not OCD'ed like I am. New gameplay are added little by little as you play, which makes every set of level quite interesting, and makes you want to go forward through thishugelevel set (5 level sets with - presumably, I haven't unlocked them all yet - 30 levels each). There's enough to play with for a few months depending on your pace, and for this price and overall quality, it's a must have."

The classical music accompanies the game in a wonderful way and has a soothing and relaxing effect.It is never too difficult that you start to feel overwhelmed or frustrated. Yet, each new puzzle is a challenge. As soon as you start to get the hang of one puzzle type, another is introduced. If you get stuck you have options to help, moves can be reversed starting from your first move or where you believe you made the mistake, or if you are completely stuck you may use tokens from previous solved puzzles to solve the puzzle for you.The basic concept of the puzzles is reminiscent of other sliding tile/sphere puzzles; however, it is so well done that it gives an original feel. I would recommend Grandpa's Table to any fan of games such as Quell, Sokoban or the classic Wooden Labyrinth games.In addition, the game was made/developed in Ubuntu Linux with Blender, Gimp, Inkscape, libGDX and the Universal Tween Engine :-) . So, as a Linux user it's a must buy to support the dev!"
,Recommended,471570,28247866,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,madth3,"A very good puzzle game.Puzzles involve sliding jewels on a board so that all jewels of the same color touch. If you cover certain specific positions in the board, you get stars and possibly a coin. Stars unlock special levels and you can use coins to show solutions in levels you find dificult. As you progress through the game, new elements are introduced in the levels.Levels are not timed and there's no movement counter either. You can solve the levels at your own pace. As you solve the special levels, you get mementos that tell a story.I found the game leaning towards the easy side. Even if some levels have many elements, there are not that many paths available and a solution shows itself.PROS:- Well created logic puzzles.- No timer. No looking for the best solution.- Undo function allows you to quickly go back to previous positions.- Good length for the price.CONS:- The game uses a 3D engine and is not as optimized as it should be. The loading time is not short and a couple of times the game refused to start. Not a big problem but you have to be patient at times.- The music is not bad but there are few tracks so it gets repetitive. It can be disabled.- No way to quickly reset a level."

The music is calming but after half an hour the music becomes repetetive and thus annoying so I switched it of and listened to an accoustic calming playlist on Spotify, that worked quite well I'd say :)Graphically it's nice, the motions are fluid and gives you a couple of hours to kill. Overall I'm happy with this game. There's no actual story line, just click and play.7,5/10"

Reminds me a lot of the ""Quell"" series although they have different styles, but if you enjoyed that then I don't see why you couldn't enjoy this."

I'm sure to spend hours playing this. I'd like to get the android copy as well if a key can be provided for me so I can play on that format please!

With the Zen-est music imaginable and pretty pieces that slide without a sound, playing this game is weirdly calm and almost sleep inducing...in a great way. Well worth the $4.99 price tag. If you love soothing games that challenge your powers of figuring enough to make you feel particularly smart when you conquer a level, pick up this gem. Feel the Superior Brain Burn!"

,Recommended,471570,23284518,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,Otter Chaos,"Grandpa's Table.  Man does that bring back memories.  I remember my grandpa's favorite game was about how his little friend under the table had accidentally eaten poison and I had to squeeze his neck until he threw up.  We played that so many times, and as many lives I saved I should get some sort of medal.That's not a lot like this Grandpa's Table though.  My time with this game has not involved any elderly genitalia, or even washing everything up “so the bad guys can't find out”.  I've seen this game compared to Quell, and that seems accurate.  You slide colored bits around until they line up in specific ways, thereby winning the game.  The puzzles get more and more devious, until you think they were designed by the Bilderberg Group.Suffice it to say, Grandpa's Table has many secrets, and you won't even have to spend years in therapy to reveal them.  Two thumbs up."
