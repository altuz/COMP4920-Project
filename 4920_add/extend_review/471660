76561198025303605,Recommended,471660,28231312,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,Jaximilian,"(UPDATED: 12/7/2016, 12/10/2016)Played for an hour immediately after purchasing. It's pretty awesome. I am too old to go writing often, so this is an reasonable way to do this without worrying about police. Although, the lack of danger does take a lot away from the experience. It's a really, really beautiful game.0. Having watched a lot of videos, and not being a beta tester, there were features missing that I expected- being able to set the time of day. That was cool. What happened? Did I just miss it?- Apparently this was buggy, so they opted not to do it now. That's cool. Focus on the painting. I've never painted this much during the ""day time"". Night time mode in this game is unusable, so just fix that and ignore this feature.1. Using the same button (right trigger) to spray as well as interact with other things (like the cans in the color shade selection) is downright annoying, because I sprayed on my wall constantly while trying to select a color. I didn't have ""undo/redo"" turned on and so that was a bummer. Why not use another button that is unassigned? In videos, there was a beam pointing from the paint can in the right hand to the color selection paint cans, and when the user was ""cycling"" through colors. The beam only works to pick the color chips now, and you can't use it to ""cycle"" through shades anymore as the videos showed. The beam pointer would definitely work better than constantly spraying my group of cans, or worse, my wall.- This is still super annoying, but you get used to it if you just keep painting. The painting interface in general needs a lot of work. Use other buttons for things instead of trigger for everything! The mixer (d-pad left) is a total waste for me. I just don't get how to use it. I'd rather look at paint cans than a color wheel and color squares.2. In the lab with the plaster wall and the lamp. Is the lamp supposed to do something? Besides me again spraying the lamp while trying to turn it off and on... I could see light on the lamp, but it did nothing to the plaster wall. It didn't light it up. It didn't make paint glisten differently. It only lit up itself. Weird.- The lighting from these lamps does not work. In the train yard, it just lit up the undercarraige of the train and some other random tags, but the side of the train was totally dark. So, I *never* paint on the train, because I'll be damned if I hold a flash light the whole time. Huge bug. Oh, and painting while holding flashlight is never going to happen. Whoever thought that was a good idea, seriously? Why not make it a head-mounted light so you can actually play the game and paint while it's on?3. Being stuck with the radio stations is very restrictive. Why not let player access own music on machine? Or, even access the cool trailer music ""Distance"" from the trailer videos. I heard constant commercials on the radio. Really, really lame. Often times no music would play. Just looping commercials and silence where music should have been. So, I turned it off.- I take it back. It's not restrictive. It's just the biggest waste of all (next to all the NPC flies all over the place) the radio simply does not work for me - EVAR. If I hear one more advert from GEICO... ugh. The stations either A.) do not play at all. or B.) Loop commercials C.) the music, while turned to max volume, is *barely* audible. Total, total waste. Does it work for anyone?. Ditch it and give us the ability to pick our own music source, please.4. From time to time the paint just goes crazy. I guess it's likely a base-station-to-paddle connection, but I'd paint a circle, and a tiny part of it would go all chaotic. It glitched like that a few times, but I think that's may be part of the wireless controller situation. I don't know what you could do to keep that from happening, but it doesn't respond well to quick wrist flicks either...not even small ones.- This is definitely a base station thing. I don't know what they could do to fix. I probably need to calibrate my base stations again.5. Drips sometimes happen...then sometimes you can't FORCE a drip, even after emptying what must be an entire can of paint in the same place. Drips are inconsistent.- OK, so I'm an idiot. The drips are fine. Again, there's no directions anywhere, but you *must* have the paint pressure set to ""Heavy"" for drips to happen. I didn't realize this the first time I reviewed. Drips work awesome, I just didn't know how to use it the first hour.6. Suggestion of no real content or value: allow user to shake can and get the rattle of the ball feel/sound with haptic feedback. I hear some mixer ball sounds, but I kept shaking my controller and not receiving the audio cue of the mixer ball. I felt silly, but missed that aspect.- I would still love this7. It feels soooo weird to spray for more than several seconds without shaking or running out of paint. Biggest 4th wall breaker of all.- Yes. Almost as big of 4th wall breaker as a graffiti game where you can't just paint anywhere. Wat?! That is so ironic, it makes me laugh. We should be able to paint anywhere in the setting. Maybe only the part that gets saved it on the playing wall...but we should be able to write all over the location...you know, for fun.It was well worth the $15.00. I wonder if all the drama in the comments page will calm down now. It's here and it's awesome. It's definitely release quality. I can't wait until I don't have to be up all night programming myself so I can make some cool pieces.12/7/2016 EDIT: have now painted a sizable, experimental piece (uploaded to community hub - Steam removed my bit.ly link). I love this game. It has its issues for sure, but I can get lost doing this for a long time. I expected to pay $50 - $60 dollars for this game and would have. $15.00 is a straight up steal.12/10/2016 EDIT: I have re-thought my last comment. Even though I anticipated paying that much, I realized later it's because I've always paid a lot for *finished* games. However, this game definitely needs a lot of work still - despite the fact that it's awesome and beautiful - it only has 2 usable locations: rooftop and top dog garage. The trains at night is unusable due to lighting bugs and an unusable flashlight. Painting at the two viable locations gets a bit old. Need more locations. Forget about birds and flies and floating pieces of garbage paper, breaking bottles, etc. It needs less ambience (it's already pretty heavy on that) more locations and work on the interface and actual game. Is it a $50 - $60 game? Potentially YES, but I would have come to my senses and been actually♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I paid that much with only 2 viable locations and all these bugs. Now, I'm just thinking ""I hope they make useful updates soon"".Either way, since I didn't pay $50-$60, I'll not be bitter until some quality updates are made. I'm going to keep painting in Kingspray, and hope they address some of the stuff I find important. If not. Meh. Other than the paint cans having the power of a fire extinguisher when set on heavy, it's damn close to spot on for simulation purposes.Great job overall devs! Just please pay more attention to the interface/paint and less on the ""extras"". The extras seem to generally suck: radio especially & flashlight usability. WHy so many flies? Also, if you can't stand on it, why make it something you can pick up and move around? To throw at other players? Waste. Focus!The core of this game is the painting. The painting is fun. Recommendation: Buy this game NOW...if you are right-handed."

,Recommended,471660,28232747,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,794,"UPDATE: I still recommend this because the relaxing atmosphere is great and most players I've met are pretty chill. HOWEVER, please read what I've pointed out in this thread:http://steamcommunity.com/app/471660/discussions/0/154643249632443591/It addresses a long list of things that need to be addressed. It may be in your better interest to wait until the game is more ironed out and these issues are gone.---Vive review:Finally this game is here, and I gotta say it's pretty nice. I'm still unhappy with the dev's decision to go unfairly radio silent when he originally intended to make the game available, but the only solice in this is that we now have a fully polished title instead of an Early Access one.The atmosphere in this game is fantastic, and incredibly easy to get lost in, especially in multiplayer. I'm not an artist at ALL, nor do I have any experience spray painting art, but I still managed to make some basic things I'm happy with.The multiplayer is nice, but definitely needs more features as it's a bit lacking right now. To find other players, you have to hop from server to server and see if there are any public rooms. It would be nice to see which servers were populated from the world map. Public rooms show you how many player slots there are, but not how many of those slots are occupied. The wall space is perfect for 2 people to share, but becomes a bit cramped for 3-4 people if they all want to paint independently alongside each other. Everything is anonymous, you have no way of seeing who you're playing with or to add them as a friend. As such, there also isn't any way to kick people if they come in to vandalize, for example. When a new player joins after the wall has already been painted a bit, it can take a bit too long to load the wall for them. And if the wall is loading for them, everyone else has to wait for the wall to load, too.Could still use a bit of optimization, I'm playing on a 1080 and was regularly dipping into my SteamVR environment during frame drops. There seems to be an issue where you get HUGE frame drops if you have your phone out on the night-time train yard map.Being able to bring up reference art on a little window and even project it onto the wall is a fantastic feature. Also, I LOVE the radio. Lots of variety for whatever you like. The radio could use some tuning up, though, it doesn't go quite as loud as I'd like it to and it also doesn't sound very realistic within the spaces you're in. For a game like this where the atmosphere is key and pretty dang nailed, this is definitely something that could use a little fine tuning.Either way, happy the game is here now and have already met some pretty cool and talented strangers."

,Recommended,471660,28543143,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,FuntCase,"Amazing!!!This game has totally lived up to expectation.First and foremost, I used to be a graffiti writer and I can confirm this has an authenticity about it, for sure.In my first test of the game i just worked out what i could do and how things worked, but then i took myself into multiplayer mode and ended up meeting some really cool dudes who i actually had conversations with and showed them what to do and how i worked. The experience was awesome!!BUTBIG BUTWhen playing multiplayer, YOU MUST BE AWARE that the clear button clears the WHOLE WALL not just what you may have sprayed on teh wall...this left me in an akward position when i first joined someone's room, played around a bit and then decided to (assumingly) clear what i'd done and in turn, it cleared the whole wall...deleting what the guy who was already in the room had done.All in all, welllllllllllllll worth the money and if you're into your art, the replayability is huge.A few cheeky bugs here and there but it's solid already!"

I noticed with the pink cap and high spray at Max distance, the spray loses randomness. It makes a dragged stamp pattern like MS paint.You can only paint one wall per level. There are no stencils or height adjustment.For a 15 dollar game about spray painting stuff, I would say the paint simulation better be great and there better be ladders and stencils. Ideally players should be able to add their own stencils.Instead of getting a refund, I want this review to stay up until the game is done."
,Recommended,471660,29158749,Posted: 10 January,all,iorek VRnison,"Smooth, easy UI. Awesome, well-chosen soundtracks - including awesome trip-hop selections. Beautiful stylings. Very good palette of preselected colors in addition to the color-picker. Three types of cap. Multiple beautiful locations. Objects in the world you can interact with. Very, very convincing brick texture which holds up to parallax perspective. A phone with which you can snap pictures, control the music, and manage the settings.Really, I have no complaints. I love it. It does exactly what I wanted, beautifully, and again: awesomely well picked trip-hop/chill soundtracks.If you want to blaze and tag to some trip hop on a rooftop at 2AM without having to put on pants, get Kingspray."

Because if so, Kingspray will give you a great one. It's halfway between graffiti and drawing with an airbrush in photoshop. The multiplayer option is lovely (if you're on the right place at the right time when other people happen to be online, anyway). And things work well. I made some art I enjoyed, and there's a bunch of cool features in the game, such as phones that let you take pictures, projectors that let you use a reference picture, etc. etc.Obviously, if you don't see yourself using a graffiti sim... then... what are you looking for here? This isn't a game, it's basically a digital graffiti tool. And for what it is, it does it very well. Would like to see this game expanded further."

,Recommended,471660,28265950,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,Hairy Hairy Robbaz,"The feeling of painting is close to spot on, it's very imersive and precise. Only spraypainted acrylics, a case and rims in real life, but the feel is there. Paint reacts in ways to expect it to.Haven't notice any of the performance dips or desyncs others been complaining about.The medium spray can could be improve at low trigger pressure and the ""lowest pressure can"" needs to be a bit stronger overall. Squatting to get lower, but would be nice to step on something to get a bit higher. Lefthanded option is also rather important.The game is good overall; I can paint, save and load without a hazel. The only real annoyance was the delay/silence of the release itself."

This is the closest you're going to get to doing graffiti without spray paint and a real wall. I highly recommend it if you're thinking about buying it. It's well worth the measly $15 price tag.One thing I hope the devs will include in futures updates:1. Using our own music IN GAME.2. Controlling the time of day like they showed in earlier trailers.Best graffiti simulator on the market. Hands down.

I never had this headache and dizziness with any Vive game but the trigger bug gave me a real headache both times I tried the game.

,Recommended,471660,29214380,Posted: 12 January,all,Bumper,"This has been my best VR experience so far.  Highly recommended.  I didn't have to drop money on paint, fix a piece after tagger scum or run from security.  Yet to check multiplayer out, having too much fun in single player.The functionality they have built in is reallly well thought out, and the guys who built it have been graffiti artists previously or have damn good advisors on board.  They have Fat Caps guys.... Fat Caps!!!  Things I would like to see fixed or added on in the future would be:i) Streaming own music (as many have said) - I also found the radio a bit buggy and lagging at times.  I have 16g ddr4, so should be up to the task.  Channel favourites would be helpful too on existing radio - could be there but haven't found it.ii) teleport is a little goosy at times - you must check your can colour after teleporting, as it is easy to hit a colour change function on the track pad at the moment.iii) cardboard for tight lines should be a priority add on.iv) a ladder for the walls.v) fume mask add on.vi) random city noises, very occasional police siren, the odd passer by checking out your work in single player, or telling you they've called the cops... lol."

Let me tell you: This make it seems so easy to work with spray paint.whilest in real life working with spray paint:If you spray inside, without a mask. You will gas your self.If you spray outside with only a mouth mask, wind will blow paint in your eyes.If you spray multiply layers, you have to wait untill one is dry.if you dont clean your nossle it might get plumped.if you have alot of cans you keep searching in your damn bag for the right one.if you lost the lid you might end up with a rainbow in your bag since you will end spraying by accident.if you spray in the house it will take hours to get the smell out.if you spray outside, well you have to go outside."

The experience is very immersive, and after a few hours in the simulation I found myself searching the net for real life spraypaint techniques; maybe I'll go out someday and try it in real life :-)Some things I'd like to get fixed:The warning message when the player's head gets ""into"" the wall is quiet annoying. Would be better if the head would just stay outside. Same goes for the spray can, a better collision management would also enable the player to use real life spraypaint tricks, like hitting the wall with the cap to produce small dots or very thin lines. And, like mentioned in a few other comments, a stencil / cardboard would also be a great addition.All in all a great game!"

Great street artists combine stencils in their creations and that ables them to bring them to another level...

I liked a lot Vivespray as idea, I bought for support and spent some hours in it. Then I ignored the launch of Kingspray (I expected to be honest a much higher price) until today, a few month after and with a nice discount.Well, the hard truth is than here I found the polishing than I was hoping for. Environments are cool, nice textures, nice lightning, interface is just fantastic, you can listen lot of internet radio when paining, do shots with a smartphone, save and load easily. To draw is much simplier than Vivespray, I'm not a graffiti expert so I can't say if it's more or less realistic, surely it's more user friendly and satisfying. I still miss to try cooperative multiplayer, I'm a kind of lone wolf... it's a very nice feature anyway.At the end of the day, I had to change my mind. And I don't know if it was so polished when it was ready for the Vive only launch (maybe early access, maybe with lot of lacking features). So, humbly, I'm giving a thumb up."

,Recommended,471660,29522048,Posted: 27 January,all,Dozenbeer,"Its fantastic. The spray-painting feels very real and you have a lot of options to choose color and enviroment.Pros:+ spraying itself feels very realistic+ ingame phone to take pictures of your artwork, selfies or using the options menu+ multiplayer that is really fun+ you can grab stuff and there is a lot, like beer bottles, basketball and hoop and even ladders to reach a higher point on a wall.+ many many colors to choose from+ different caps and pressure options+ insert a jpeg for reference with a projector right on the wall+ many different enviroment and surfaces to paint on, like a Van or a rooftop+ paint in nighttime with a flash light in your hand+ left hand mode+ music comes from a boombox with directional audio, you can also use your own music+ the soundtrack is awesome and it also features radio streaming, not only did they include Hip Hop stations, but real Metal stations (that I prefer) and I dont mean Rock, I mean Metal! Its unusual, because the culture of graffiti is almost always linked to Hip Hop culture, I found that to be very cool to suit all kinds of preferences+ a gallery to see all your saved artwork and you can find it in the folder to upload elsewhere+ replay videos of your spraying+ quick options to change color in hand or use a color that you have used beforeCons:- graffiti for me was not only to spray-paint, its also putting up stencils and using fat markers or tagged stickers, which is not in the game- not many people online- content that is shown on the shoppage video is not in the game, like changing your avatar, everybody looks the same with a cap and mask, which makes taking a selfie pretty pointless- on their Youtube channel they showed how you can change the daytime, but thats also not possible. There are levels that are nighttime only or daytime only.- some of the items that you can interact with are broken, which is very disappointing, since these are the most useful ones, like the floodlightI really like this software, you can do so much with it. I am not a sprayer or ever was and I still have a lot of fun with Kingspray. Its the perfect opportunity for all those that always wanted to try it out, but where afraid of doing it illegally.People online are always nice and I met some real sprayers, that were helping me get started. The price is right on the spot.  You get a lot for your money and its a very relaxing experience."

,Recommended,471660,28237311,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,DrTy Words,"3rd Edit:The game is great and I've spent quite a lot of time with it. The 1st update fixed the most common issues. There is still one major complaint that I have.The worklights don't interact with the paintable surfaces, most likely not on any of the maps. This makes the maps with muted lighting effectively unplayable. You can use the torch, but it gets tiresome switching back and forth constantly. It's a little better with the improvements in the first patch, but the worklights need to be fixed. Until then we are limited to two environments.I've also noticed that new players who join a session have a bugged torch. They start with it enabled even though it isn't selected in their menus."

The program also saves your art to a .png file which you can use to read it outside of the game, so if you wanted to just make graffiti art you can use for other reasons, it works (a main reason why I was interested in it).I wish they were a bit more realistic however, as the final result doesn't look that much different than what you can achieve in photoshop, because the king spray ""brushes"" are a bit too primitive and don't take advantage of all the extra input you get with the vive controllers. IMO the spray cans should take into account the angle at which you spray against the wall, and the drip lines should be a bit more predictable and be based around paint build up, where today they seem to be based around a random timer.The drip lines also didn't seem to work until I went into the options and checked them on/off again.But overall, still quite fun, i enjoy it more than tilt brush when it comes to messing around in."

I was fearing that they sold out to Facebook and got payed to do a timed exclusive for the Oculus.They probably got money from Facebook to make this game a launch title for the Touch Controllers. And they probably could have released this earlier on Steam for the Vive.But you know what? Now after finally getting my hands on this game and being able to play this. I'm totally fine with it!The Devs did the right thing. There are many Early Access VR Titles here on Steam, some good, but also a lot not so good.This is not one of them.This game is very polished. And that's what VR needs right now. Polished games that feel complete from the second you buy them.The actual spraying in this game feels very realistic. It's probably the most realistic I have yet seen in a game. The controls are very intuitive, after the first few minutes and upon completing the tutorial you're immediately familiar with them and everything flows very well.Also noteworthy are the extra features. Like playing back your whole painting from the beginning. Very usefull for creating timelapses afterwards from different angles.Then there's other things like the projector, where you can select an Image from your pc to have it being projected on the wall your painting on (you can move the projector around to select position and size of the image).There's also a 360 Screenshot option, which I have yet to test out.To round up the review:I would definately recommend everyone to buy this game. You get exactly what you pay for if not a lot more. 15$ is a very fair price for this game."

With spray on heavy, you can blast whole walls in 3 passes from 6 feet away, which seems kind of silly.  Conversely, on light you can't apply a drop if you're beyond 3-4 inches distance regardless of how long you stand there spraying.  Youcanlightly pull the trigger to apply a thin coat, but it would be nice to have the distance fall-off expanded out so it's possible to actually mist, instead of the all-or-nothing it is now that feels a little too close to MS Paint.That said, it's still super satisfying to put on some music and just lose yourself painting.

Save often because it happens at random times- Some settings doesn't save, or don't do anything, like drip toggle- If you use projection, make sure to do the piece in one sitting, as the projector doesn't save and since the placement system sucks big time, you wont be able to put it in the same position again.- A couple of the in progress pieces i have for some reason load upside down.- Sometimes freezes for a brief moment after you've painted something. Quite annoying.Bottom line, it is a great experience for VR, quite polished visually and in regards to interaction, but the bugs can ruin it sometimes.As soon as some of this is fixed (specially the problem with the crashes) i'll be happy to change my review, but i wouldn't recommend in its current state.
