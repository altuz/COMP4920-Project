Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to ""tell 'em coach sent ya"". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.In a world where it seems like we are constantly being bombarded with negativity, and where everyone is divided, this game is like a haven of positivity. Much like the reviews, the game itself is ""overwhelmingly positive"""

,Recommended,471710,30070378,Posted: 20 February,all,Ratchet Hoe,"This is a fantastic and must-have game if you have a Vive! It's free!This game is basically Wii Sports for the VR world, but it's also social. You can talk to other players, and even give them a high five! The fist-bump is used to join a party with them, which I think was pretty neat.Paintball is challenging, and there are a few small ""invisible walls"" you think you can shoot through, but you just splatter paint. That aside, great game! ..You get the excitement of paintball without the welts.Disc golf, dodgeball and other games are great fun, I can certainly see myself playing this for quite some time!"

76561198350302274,Recommended,471710,30184294,Posted: 25 February,all,yongjin0501,"I think Rec Room should add warning about racial discrimination.Rec Room is a worldwide VR social game. That's the reason why all of the people from various countries are able to join here.Unfortunately, there are some children who can't understand about this diversity of people.So, their behaviour to foreigners is extremely rude and nasty.This is the reason why Rec Room should add warning of segregation on the dorm room just like sexual harassment. Additionally, it's not easy to kick them with the voting system.One of my japanese friend did stop playing Rec Room because these kinds of problems.So please make warnig of this matter, or please add segregation category in kicking system, and make a list of them.Rec Room is really popular as the best VR Social Network game, these personal problems must be fixed if Rec Room need to remain for a long time."

First off, the devs are incredibly responsive and are constantly listening to what the community base wants. Second, they release new game modes, maps, items, etc. quite often, which keeps the game fresh. Third, you will not find a better VR UI. Seriously. The watch is brilliant.

To my suprise, this has quickly become my favorite game not just for the HTC Vive, but my favorite game overall. With the new quest expansion, devs have shown this isn't going anywhere, and is only going to get better.I only hope now that they'll expand quest mode a bit.

This game is a one of a kind VR experience, and with the new gamemode released there are tons of cosmetic items to collect to customize your character.It has quite a big community for a VR game and most people you come across are really friendly, there are tons of activities to do that will keep you occupied for hours. Heck, there's even a private lounge where you can even play blackjack with your friends.There isn't much bad about the game, it gets updated constantly, fixing bugs etc. I highly recommend this to any oculus / vive owner. It can be really fun and I have had more enjoyment out of this game than a high end VR game like Arizona Sunshine or Raw Data.There is alot of replayability here, It is definitely worth a shot."

It is challenging, but I did beat it 3 times 😊Paintball: Endless fun. Lounge room: So fun with friends, tell jokes on stage, draw things with the 3d marker, play cards whatever best for private gatherings.Children under 13 arent allowed and it is very easy to kick using the wristwatch interface."
