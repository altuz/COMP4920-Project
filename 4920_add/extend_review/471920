For the most part, I enjoyed it greatly; the graphics, atmosphere and other-worldliness of it all has massive appeal.However;- Some of the puzzle bits I found very obscure. Near the beginning of the game I spent over an hour wandering aimlessly about unable to makeanyprogress. Simply because I missed/misinterpreted the significance of two tiny things. In case you are also stuck, it'sthe fireflies in the mine, and the hexagon on the floor there.- Even when I'd solved some of the puzzles I didn't really understand why. I mainly brute-forced the gems in the mine, for example; I've still no idea at all why the solution is correct.- It's not readily apparent how to drop items. (Hint; click on the item itself, not the ground.)- The controls are generally excellent; with great path-finding. However, the number of times I accidently went up and down the tower defies belief.- As others have said, it's short. Even with the aimless wandering and ladder-climbing it only took me 3.5 hours. At the current price-point that does seem lacking in content.I'm leaving it as recommended, as for the most part it is a beautifully crafted, delightful game. To mark it as not recommended would be like kicking a puppy. But be wary of the above points, and if in doubt wait for a sale."

The same goes the the orinal sound track that has some catchy tunes for the some moments but it's mostly ambiant music, add to that a neat sound design for the noise. It's a game that looks, sounds, and feels like Monument Valley.This is a good inspiration, that smartphone game was overall a good experience... but they copied THE bad parts of it too. While I'm delighted that the studio designed it without a single line of text to tell you where to go, it's not that hard once you figure out basic stuff. And you can be stuck because some trigger need to be activated and you have no clue about them, hopefully there are only a few in the game but it still is a frustation point.Unlike Machinarium, an Amanita Design's game that narrates you a complete story without a single word, Pan-Pan is a simple pretext scenario with only two events : the space ship crashes on an unknown planet and (""spoiler alert"") you go look for the parts in order to fly away...Finally, the game is freaking short. Two hour at most, I'm not kidding. You can genuinely buy the game full price, finish it, sell its card, and get a refund on Steam if you're that kind of jerk.I would still recommend it, but with extreme caution on the kind of player seeking advice. If all the things you read don't frighten you, you should give it a go. Otherwise, pass your way."

All the characters made adorable noises. There were a lot of wandering around wondering what to do, but it was fun to explore the surrounding. Some puzzles were quite hard but I liked that. I found the controls a bit frustrating, like putting items down or waiting for the character to walk around a long way since it's not possible to jump.It's a short game but I think it's worth it's price. I really enjoyed it!"

,Recommended,471920,31530745,Posted: 3 May,all,char,I love this game. The art is wonderful and the puzzles and simple but fun. The developer is a rad dude and he fixed a bug that broke my game within days of me reporting it.
76561197968933384,Recommended,471920,25240599,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,cbrocato,"Pan-Pan is a nicely-styled environmental puzzle adventure.  It has a simple but endearing art style.  Controls are basic, and puzzles are fairly inuitive.  There is no inventory, other than some active and passive tools you acquire.  Unfortunately, there is not much content, perhaps 2-6 hours of gameplay with not much incentive for replay.  A pity, because I craved more puzzles and more of the world.Pros: Charm, styleCons: Too short for full priceSummary:  Worth picking up, but wait for a discount."

The simple sounds, the ambient music, the exploration. I hope the developers continue to develop more games like this one! It's when I play games like these I'm happy there are indie developers out there."

I've really enjoyed playing it even though I am stuck on one eye puzzle that doesn't seem to want to be solved....It's a solid fun game for only $12.99. I highly recommend getting it.

It's super relaxing and the puzzles make you think. It's satisfying to solve and the characters and style are unique and beautiful.It's overall a simple and fun game for those who like puzzle adventures and no dialogue.I recommend this game to people who fancy relaxing puzzle games, and exploration."
,Recommended,471920,30414223,Posted: 9 March,all,Asiris,Pan-Pan is a good puzzle game. It's definitely has a distinct art style. It's probably its strongest selling point.Puzzles are okay in Pan-Pan. Not really challenging. They're quite simple to be honest.The biggest let down though is the length of the game. It's very short. Especially for the asking price.I would recommend to wait for a good sale for the game. I don't say it often for indie games but you'll be better off if you buy it at least at 50 discount.

,Recommended,471920,25455176,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,Your Uncle Gael,"Pan-Pan is a short but sweet puzzle game, with artistic visuals and music akin to those of Monument Valley. It'll only take you around 2 hours (at most) to complete it, but that’s perfect for this game. It shows you exactly what the game is about, sets you free to solve all the puzzles, and never overstays its welcome.The moment you start a new game you are welcomed with delightful visuals, calming music, and a screen pure of any HUDs, text, or unnecessary cut scenes. Outside the menus, the game uses no words. Instead, it delivers its short story through the characters’ interactions and endearing sounds. Have I mentioned how charming the music is?Visuals and sounds aside, the game delivers a fair number of puzzles, many of which involve moving objects around or pressing buttons. The puzzles are fairly easy, but not too easy. The game also displays some visual hints, enough to push you towards the right direction, but not too much that it annoyingly holds your hands. You’re free to walk around and solve the puzzles at your own pace and in any order. However, it’ll become obvious a bit later into the game that you need to solve some puzzles before others to open up new routs or obtain items.The game feels good while it lasts. You won’t spend much time squeezing your brain for solutions. There isn’t any replay value. It’s nothing jaw-dropping. But that’s exactly what the game is about, sort of like drinking a nice cup of tea after a long day of work."

The puzzles are clever, it has great sound and visuals, and it's got so much character even without dialogue.It's only a couple of hours long (depending how long it takes you to figure the puzzles out) but considering the price I'd say it's definitely worth every penny.Overall: Strongly recommended!PS: I did a full playthrough of it for my YouTube channel if you'd be interested in seeing it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjgiUKqbgKI"

The only thing that bothered me was short play time. I finished the game in 2 hours. Loved the colors used in the world, and liked music too. Just sad that it ended so fast. Maybe more story lines could have made it better."

It felt pretty difficult in the beginning but after a little while everything in this cozy world started to make sense. A lot of the puzzles requires a bit of thinking outside the box which is great. I recommend playing it with a friend so you can figure out things together.
