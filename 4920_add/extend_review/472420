76561197994782386,Recommended,472420,31487632,Posted: 1 May,all,uka7777,"Very funny and short classical point-and-click adventure game from the people who have brought us 'The Curse of Monkey Island'.Now, that was a masterpiece even if it was created without Ron Gilbert, but... most of the later works by Bill Tiller and Larry Ahern turned out to be, well, not so good. 'A Vampyre Story' and 'Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island', in spite of their similar humor and visual style, were not successful and, to tell the truth, rather boring.Luckily, 'Duke Grabowsky' falls almost in the same league as 'Monkey Island'! Something just like earlier Telltale projects, before they fired Dave Grossman and switched to gameplayless visual novels.Pros.* Pretty graphics. Yes, it is 3D, but very bright, colorful and appealing! Even some piratey atmosphere is there.* Music is great as well, although some bits of it are borrowed from 'Ghost Pirates'.* Humor. Now, that is a welcome and longed-for addition!Cons.* Length and scope - it is strange, but the game that was in development since 2014 (and missed its planned release date by one year) is very short - 2-3 hours at most. The story is strange (albeit still fun) and definitely incomplete, while no actual news of a sequel have been heard yet...* General simplicity - why, or why there are almost no inventory puzzles? In a classical point-and-click adventure game?? Made by masters of the genre??? We do get to pick some items, but only a few of them, no combination allowed, and most of those items are just 'ideas', not actual objects...Anyway, the game is definitely recommended - especially at a serious discount that will last for a couple of days more! Go and grab it! So they would finally make us a sequel. Or better,  a dozen of sequels."

The only main difference is the protagoinist, see below.- The main character is very different from the usual protagonist. Usually the player controls a person who is intelligent, witty and he/she usually overcome the obstacles through brain power. Duke is the complete opposite, and I had hard time to relate to a dumb gorilla.- It's pretty short and looks like the chapter one of a longer story.Nice, but not great."

The character animations are also a little janky.Hopefully if they continue this series, they can tighten up the graphics on level 3."

It has so much potential and its painfully short. I saw evrything in 2 hours.And i then spent 40 mins looking to make sure i had done everythiing.The main protagonist Duke seems to know alot of people on the island already, I feel like i jumped into a game 20 mins before the end. How did he meets these characters? How did his captain die? Where do they go after Duke gets made new captain?So many questions. This games short. Too short. It almost seems a waste to have this many characters and a story thats begging to be told through them. And its for this reason i dont recommend it."

Ye won't regret it !Duke Grabowski: Mighty Swashbuckler is a funny point and clic adventure taking place in a world of Pirates. The Game stars a dumb pirate who wants to replace his recently deceased Captain ; in order to do so, his crew gives him a challenge : “sea-deuce” three ladies and prove he's not only a pile of muscles without a brain.The game is simple, there are sadly few puzzles but the dialogues and the voice acting are refreshing. To be honnest the graphics and the animations aren't that great, but it's colorful and the music is quite good and in line with the theme. The game itself is quite short (around 3 hours of gameplay), entertaining and funny, so I hope there will be more episodes coming out. The games offers itself for a sequel, so let's make it happen !I gladly recommend Duke Grabowski: Mighty Swashbuckler to classical point and clic adventures lovers."

I wish it was longer and hopefully there will be many more sequels in the future. The characters were fun and entertaining. The art and music was great and it had a nice flow to it. Hopefully in the future games there will be more items to interact with as it didn't seem to get much use our of the inventory. I would recommend the game and other from this company.

Bill Tiller and Dave Grossman were extensively involved and Ron Gilbert collaborated. The biggest problem that I have is that the game is basically a dumbed down version of Monkey Island 1 Chapter 1 (The three trials). You not only get a really short game (2 hours max) that may or may not have future installments, but the story is not original. In this game you have to woo three ladies. That is the most boring thing I think that could be thought up. There are no mind bending puzzles, limited inventory, and the game is linear as no task crosses into another. The character of Duke is forgettable and the humor is not funny. The art is good, but does not make up for the many aspects that cause this game to fail. I usually give kickstarters more of a break given their circumstance, but from everything that I have mentioned I don’t think I can for this game."

I think the Coconut Tree Lady says about everything I might want to say about the main quest, but as a short little adventure game it's worth the $8 or whatever. Occasional production polish issues with the text but nothing that bothers one too much."

It is a fairly simple puzzle game with clever character names and funny dialogue. The puzzles and game mechanics aren't spelled out to you, which is nice because they are easy to figure out on your own. A couple of tweaks to the text shadowing would be good, but despite that it looks great. It's definitely worth the $7-8 for a few hours of a feel good story and who knows you may just learn a thing or two about wooing the ladies."

The Puzzles2. The HumourDuke Grabowski disappointingly falters on both.Point and click adventures have long been plagued by nonsensical puzzles. Much to its detriment Duke Gabrowski has gone in the complete opposite direction, making its puzzles simple enough to be trivial.The aim of the game is to woo three ladies in the game's locale, Bodacious Bay, turning it into more of a pirate-themed dating simulator. This of course reduces variety in the puzzles, unlike The Secret of Monkey Island's Three Trials. The biggest problem posed by this, however is that the puzzles are entirely independent of one another ie. no elements from one puzzle are to be used in any other. Compare this to the four map pieces of LeChuck's Revenge, which were all beautifully intertwined.The game is also too short to call back to any puzzles, as was done with the voodoo doll and hangover cure in LeChuck's Revenge and The Curse of Monkey Island respectively. I do realise that this is an episodic game (despite not being stated anywhere on its store page) but I have found that episodic games tend to rarely utilise call-back puzzles anyway.The jokes jump between puns and political incorrectness, almost as though it was written by my dad.The dialog ""options"" are extremely limited. I always like being able to chose how I personally would react in a situation (often flitting between overly pleasant and unbearably sarcastic, as anyone who know me would testify is true to real life). The dialog options here though only seem to cater to Sloth out of The Goonies.In such a short game there are too many attempts to reference classic LucasArts adventures (I counted 4) which came across as disingenuous and trying to play on nostalgia. To reference South Park's Member Berries ""ooh, 'member Monkey Island?"".The music is absolutely fantastic and evoked memories of The Curse of Monkey Island, which drew me in immediately. Unfortunately the rest of the game didn not manage to live up to this. I highly doubt that I will be purchasing any further games in the series."

Nah, they've been tapped already.'), and the art and animation is charming. The puzzles are logical, while still presenting some challenge - I was never frustrated, but I was rewarded.Only minor gripes are a couple of small UI bugs - nothing that got in the way of the experience - and the fact that Duke has to turn on the spot before walking to where you click, which makes him feel a little unresponsive.All in all, a very enjoyable adventure with a lot of nice moments. Worth your time and money if you enjoy adventure games and / or fun dialogue."

The backgrounds are gorgeous and consistent, the world is appealing and believable. The story is quite simple and straightforward but it's quite enough to be enjoyable. To me, this game is also an improvement on Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island on several levels : the writing and narrative is done much better and isn't confusing this time, the gameplay is smoother, characters are more likable/memorable, better voice acting.On the other hand, the game is a bit too easy : the puzzles would have benefited from more complexity and layers to them, the inventory is not used enough because there isn't much to pick up and try combinations with.Considering this is a low budget game and the first episode in a serie, I'm happy with it and I'm quite confident the sequels will continue to improve on it. Anyway, Duke Grabowski is totally worth the fun and price. Looking forward to the subsequent episodes !To sum up+swashbuckling pirates !!+funny dialogues and nice voice acting.+gorgeous scenery.+a step up from it's precusor Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island-puzzles are a too easy : not enough objects to pick up and play with in the inventory."

Its graphics are in stylized 3d and the voice over is well done, however the best is the excellent writing which is funny from beggining until the end. Even though this is a very short game (around 2- 3 hours), it will give you a very fun evening. I recommend it to all point and click lovers."

I mean who doesn't love Maniac Mansion, Day of The Tentacle, and Monkey Island. Within the last few years, a few of the former Lucas Arts gang got together and worked on my new Favorite game - The Cave (which is full of brilliant dark humor and even had Chuck the Plant). So maybe my expectations were too high with this one? Clearly the game has adult themes ( wooing women and ""burying the family jewels in a wenches treaure chest"" and so forth), but if that was the case then why the simplistic game? It really wasn't that challenging and the game was super short. The locations were minimal and the puzzles were so easy a child could do them. So I am confused as to what demographic they were trying to target. The sadest part of all is that the Lucas Arts gang was known for its brilliant dark humor, but that fell completely flat here.  I realize this isn't the exact same team, nor is it Lucas Arts, but knowing some of the team's background, this is disappointing.  I guess for $6.99 it isn't bad, but I sadly cannot recommend it."

The game is short. But then again, is an episodic game so it is to be expected.2. The puzzle are not hard in any way. This statement I will keep it because I don't consider them hard at all. I recently played The ABC Murders and I found myself stock for a lot longer with some of the puzzle in there, but then again, lots of the puzzles in Duke were lot of fun.3. The story felt it was a little rushed and cut in the end. I hope they make a continuation just to know more about it. Then again, episodic game so we will know what will happen with Duke in the end and hopefully he will continue with his original way of solving things.4. There were some minor overlaping of characters, but then again I also found out it was a small team working in this game so I have to say that it was overall a really nice job doing all of this with the crew they had."

I had to check walkthroughs for Deponia, Siberia and other similar games to complite them. And i have finished ""Duke"" without having to ask the almighty internet for advice even once. This is not a compliment. Also the game is short, i have cleared it in about 3 hours. Could be faster, but i spent alot of time listening to the Duke comments on all the interactable stuff of which about 50% are complitely irrelevant to the game itself. Like seriously - half of the game characters and ineractables are a cameos and references to the dev team and kickstarter backers. Easter eggs and cameos are nice and no one hates them... in moderation, but making half of the game with em? This is way over the top. Also the ending was lackluster and unimpactful. I was expecting a twist, but ""there be no twist"".I honestly can't recommend this to anyone."

I really do hope this game does well enough to see a sequel with Duke off on his first adventure as Captain.This game has excellent voice over talent and nice artwork that is fitting for the style of story.  Gameplay is old school with lots of dialogue.  This was a kickstarter and so I am guessing that this is as much game as funding would allow.  I hope that this does well enough for any sequels to have more puzzle-like situations to figure out as well as the character interaction.  But on the whole, I liked this very much.  It was nice to toss my feet up and wander around this piratey town talking to the locals and scaring monkeys."

I understand the need to reward kickstarter supporters, but it can be done more subtly than that.- The puzzles are child play.- The game(if you can even call it that) takes about an hour to an hour and a half to finish. It feels like an opening to a game (like a first chapter) rather than a full experience.

You ask the same stupid questions over and over. The replies to those questions don't make any sense. The main character is supposed to be big and dumb but it never managed to be in a funny way.

It has easy gameplay, decent voice acting and is overall a decent game.Also the scene where you throw the jaguar over the island made me laugh out loud.What I had problems with:First let me get this out of the way - This feels like a monkey Island clone. The plot feels like a watered down version of the ""Three Pirate Trials"" from the Secret of Monkey Island and was kind of boring to be honest. Also I found some of the dialogue to be uninteresting and generic compared to other popular adventure games.  Another thing I had a problem with is the character models. They seem very stiff and their lack of proper facial expressions in some of them felt really weird and uncanny. Finally my biggest issue with this game is that it's way too easy and the inventory is very limited. You don't really get a chance to experiment with items to see what works which really takes the fun out of the game for me. I also recommend you get it on sale since it's really short!I'll recommend this game since I don't think that this is a a bad game but I will recommend you rather go play the Monkey Island series instead if you are looking for a good pirate adventure game."
