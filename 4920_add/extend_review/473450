First off, the graphics are pretty good, being what they are.The narrator is NOT a♥♥♥♥♥♥ He's an annoying, grating repetetive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Not only does he repeat himself every few seconds, but he usually doesn't even get a chance to finish his setence before he's launched into a new line.The game killer for me, is this. There is no analogue control. Just like IWTBTG the first couple apple trees drop apples for an insta kill and clouds drop lighting bolts for instakills, blah blah. The point is, you can't slowly edge towards it to set the trap off. You move so quicky that even if you tap the direction super quick, at least 1/2 the time you'll end up running underneath a death trap even though you knew it was there.If it had analogue control with pads, or even a walk key I might have tried to actually finish this game. As it is I'm refunding and hoping to God I never have to hear the nasal repetitive voice of the Narrator again."

It's harder to use game mechanics to turn the gameplay itself into a funny joke. This game manages to do both. A masterpiece of an old game comedy genre, the ""unfair platformer"" (think Kaizo Mario), it murders you in all the funniest and silliest ways, while the narrator, a foul-mouthed psychopath of GLaDOS scale, mocks your every action. Short and spicy, this game manages to turn even the frustration into comedy."

Ignore the game's misleading title. The Narrator really is a benevolent person and he would never attempt to manipulate you into deathtraps of his own design, or mock you relentlessly for getting killed by an apple falling sideways into your path at mach speeds.Not a bad little platformer game.

,Not Recommended,473450,23767581,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Cardinal Ximenez,"The Narrator Is a♥♥♥♥♥♥/i] [sic] proclaims itself to be a ""comedy-based, challenging 2D platformer"" that is ""fully narrated"". In some (admittedly reaching) sense, this is true. But it is onlyjusttrue. The comedy is not funny, the challenge is not clever, and the narration is not interesting.The first thing I saw when I started up this game is a ""Made with Unity Personal Edition"" splash screen. This is not, in itself, a horrendous thing, but more often than not is indicative of mediocrity. Still, I am committed to the premise, and carry on.The second thing I saw was a heavily cropped fullscreen window on a different monitor (I have a dual-screen setup on Linux). I could make it to the options, but several options, including windowed mode, were inaccessible, and upon attempting another resolution, the game crashed. Further attempts to boot resulted in a blank screen. Fortunately (or so I thought), there was a prefs file in the config path. I tried altering it; it failed to do anything, for apparently the game alters the prefs file on startup.Eventually (and only after a period of time longer than I ended up playing the game for), I found a situation where deleting the prefs file allowed for the game to show up on my primary monitor, which, while still cropped,couldallow me to reach the button for windowed mode.Also, the volume options default to 0, no sound. This is a game about a voiced narrator. Take a second to think about this.The game itself is...uninteresting. There's no real puzzles, and the obstacles are either traps or moderately annoying percision platforming. I allowed myself to think, initially, that there was some level of meta-commentary on the canonical Indie Puzzle Platformer with Narration that is in the zeitgeist, but in retrospect, this was too optimistic. The narration just sort of contradicts the on-the-ground reality and occasionally yells at you. There's no real interaction with the gameplay. You might as well just let it be silent. This is not serving any higher purpose; the crappy gameplay does not reek of intentionality or camp.There's a Dance Dance Revolution minigame in the second level (which requires you to figure out that the 'E' key, andonlythe 'E' key, is needed to interact with NPCs when prompted), where you are prompted to put inputs in time with arrows overlapping the arrow boxes. This only works with WASD keys, while you can play the rest of the game with the arrow keys. Keybinding is either absent or sufficiently obscure to the point that I did not see it.I gave up on the third level at the flying spike trap. It did not seem worth it to go through all of the traps you had already avoided repeatedly to get back to that obstacle.With substantial overhauls, there might be the start of a good concept here, but I'm not particularly getting my hopes up forThe Narrator is a♥♥♥♥♥♥II:♥♥♥♥♥♥Harder."
,Recommended,473450,24434604,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Dapper,"The Narrator is a♥♥♥♥♥♥From a single playthrough perspective I think most people who have viewed the trailer and perhaps read reviews of ""The Narrator is a♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; before purchasing it will be left satisfied with the game. The game is exactly as the trailer portrays. A challenging unfair platformer with an often lude and sadistic narrator who accompanies your player from start to finish. The comedy and gameplay catered to me perfectly.Now, I enjoyed my first playthrough enough to play it again.. and again and again until I finally earned all achievements for the game. Having played this game a lot (probably more than I should have) I did notice that this game is not very friendly to the other masochists out there that are willing to torture themselves until they too earn the ""HOW?!?"" achievement (for those who do not already know, this achievement is unlocked after completing the entire game without dying).Reasons:If you have just finished the game and wish to play through it again I would advice you to exit the game and relaunch it before clicking ""New Game"" at the ingame menu. In short, doing this will avoid an audio bug.If you prefer to play in windowed mode your settings will not be saved. Every time you launch this game you will have to manually toggle windowed mode to On.I don't know if this was intentional but there are times when your player will randomly fall through the ground. At first I didn't mind this too much. It seemed to be harmless because in most cases you can jump out and continue with your run. However on two runs where I hadn't died, I earned my first death by falling through bridges. After this happened the first time I developed a phobia of bridges and played the rest of the game frantically hopping along each bridge to lessen my chances of falling. It didn't work.The last problem with the game I had which is specific to the HOW?!? achievement is that once you begin a new game and die there is no way to reset back to the first stage with zero deaths. In order to reset back to the beginning you have to exit the game; relaunch it; click ""New Game"" & then confirm that you would like to reset. It's tedious and adds insult to injury. I hope a quick reset option will be added in the future.BUTI did enjoy this game! There is a big focus on learning from your mistakes. After a few playthroughs I had learned the levels well enough to stop myself from running directly into a spike or being murdered by a falling apple. The once ""unfair platformer"" turned into a relatively fair plaformer where a few precise jumps and the final stage became the bane of my existence.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge.UPDATE:Crossed out issues I had with the game I can now confirm as being resolved in the latest patch. Good job dev(s)!"

If you are not great at platformers (I'm certainly lacking skills in this area) then you will hear the same lines over and over. You can turn the narration off but I would have liked to have seen a system that reduces them to some lines such as ""you know this by now""...""and again"" down to the point of not playing anything till the narrator has something new to say based on your progress.I got slightly frustrated at the difficulty of the game but that's one of it's selling points so I expected it so it was mainly because I had concerns that the game was impassible (and only had a tiny bit of play and some fake videos). This is not the case at all and I should have been more persistent but I had tried to get past the lighting clouds for like 30 mins with no luck after I recorded the video. A game with this level of difficulty is not my cup of tea but I know some will love it with a passion and say its not that hard at all!From seeing others videos I can see this game certainly has its funny moments to work through.Not sure if it is just with me but I've had an issue setting the resolution and had to run it in windowed mode or the graphics are zoomed. I tried playing with dpi settings back to normal and disabling dpi scaling on the exe but with no luck.I'd personally like to see a full run of the game but don't have the skills to do that myself without cracking up and that kills the enjoyment of the comedy for me.I'd recommend it but only for those that really like a challenging platformer."
