,Not Recommended,473470,23723570,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,I only win when I play frog,"I thought about liking this game anyways just to offset the like-dislike ratio a bit, but this game honestly isn't good enough to warrant that. The art and gameplay are slightly reminiscent of the Heroes of might and magic games which is why i bought this, however, it is far inferior to those classics. It only costs a dollar, so if you are curious then perhaps it is worth buying regardless.The biggest problem I have with the game is the overall alpha level feel and polish. There are very few assets in the game and there are no movement or attack animations. I found the game too easy though I have not gotten too far yet. Every part of the game reeks early access with the constant feeling of ""this part might be good once they do a proper job on it"".Edit: I have edited this review in response to a comment from the developer. There is now a tutorial available, and it seems I was mistaken about the developer not intending to update the game. It will perhaps improve in the future. However I still do not really reccomend the game in this state unless you are curious."

It loads the initial screen, shows the main menu covered in clouds. You can't click anything on the map.2. Help menu literally says: ""Blah blah blah"".I can't stress it enough, how bad are games like this one, and how none of devs like this should be able to make profit off of their broken product, while cheating the player base."

Clicking on a character or enemy often doesn’t work as they have to be clicked in precisely the correct placeVisually, the game is much too cluttered.  There is just way too much detail for such a pixelated low res game.  THe monster design all the way to the pixelated scribbles on the back drop just leave too much of a visual messThe combat is straightforward but uninspired.The game defaults to Monitor 0, instead of whatever your primary display is (shift + win + arrow key)Overall, I would much rather play The Banner Saga than this."

I like the gloomy atmosphere & music, the fog on the map is nice, but the enemies get redundant.  The battle music could use a few more tracks, but the real let-down of the game wasn't all that (you almost expect it from this type of game), the big flop was the ending.  It left me asking ""Is that it? What just happened?  Did I just beat the game?""Good for an afternoon if you need to distract yourself from something you have to  do online, but not much else."

,Recommended,473470,29387392,Posted: 20 January,all,fizzy flask,"So I'm enjoying this game so far. Its hands down worth the $1 pricetag. It is not perfect however, So I will lay out the pros and cons.Pros:+ music is good+ game has branching paths to explore. You can play the entirety of the paths and if you follow along with the text, its pretty clear to assume which ways take you closer to the end and what ways are filler/ distractions to help you grind.+ gameplay is fun and balanced+ difficult but fair gameplay, not too punishing+ extensive skill tree+collectible and upgradeable allies can be gained from every level. There is not a unique ally for every level but there is a good variety of allies.+ You will easily collect all trading cards available in the game before beating it. Not as short as most $1 games are.Cons:-User Interface in general. the grid squares are too small and it is possible to click on the wrong thing (you have to click on the square you want a character to move on or the square the character is standing on to select that character, this mean clicking on a character's feet rather than the character itself, which takes getting used to).-the small grid squares also makes it hard to judge/predict movement/attack ranges of enemies to efficiently strategize.-some paths (such as the black widow's nest branch) feel very unrewarding and I regret doing the full set of levels in the branch.-not very much of a tutorial. leaves a lot of questions you have to figure out for yourself (I plan on making a guide in the near future and I've already gotten started on it).-AI is fairly predictable and almost always just attacks whatever unit you put closest to it.Bottom Line: Its a fun game that is worth the pricetag but it isn't for everyone and has bad UI. If you arent that picky, then pick this one right up and enjoy. I liked it. <3"

There is a decent ammount of narritive, its inexpensive and fun, the music isn't that bad either."

First of all, pixel design is nice, story is good too, tutorial is fast and showing us all we need to know, but the game controls are hard and confusing to use. I mean, after one of our allies did turn, make automatically we get screen to use second ally, if you can understand, I must click other ally several times to make him do something... But after all, game is good."

,Not Recommended,473470,33688971,Posted: 20 July,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Tactical - FantasyAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Grindy. Lacks content diversity. A slog. Narrative not worth it. Most of the map is useless and you can beeline to the end boss quick if you know which path to take, only one map then game over. Slow clunky UI for hex based combat makes soloing with hero only way forward.Review: You hit a ceiling in terms of content about 7 fights in. The rest is just grinding stats for your hero so you can defeat the gatekeeper and get the game over still image. Writing was ceremonious and befitting of an afterlife theme, but the narrative itself was not all that gripping. The setting is purgatory, kind of as a spinoff to novel of dante. The geographical description are short, but often surprising, and hints a unique bosses or unique conditions, but you always get the same recycled backdrops and foes. Micromanaging a squad is annoying and mostly useless as you can make your hero OP just by farming the first level a few times. The sprites I thought were beautiful in game once your eyes adjust to the indie setting they had nice fluid idle animations but nothing for attack and defense or death. The audio was pretty solid as well all around. The upgrade tree seemed badly designed, both in terms of balance and also in terms of cost to purchase and effects bestowed. The active abilities take huge portions of your health which makes them useless."

,Not Recommended,473470,25299544,"Posted: 1 September, 2016",all,Imban,"Purgatory is a terrible game in the simplified King's Bounty knockoff genre (see: Braveland, Beasts Battle) that makes me wish I had died and gone to Hell rather than be stuck playing it. Even in a genre generally lacking in entertaining games, it stands out as being particularly tedious and badly-assembled.Where I am now, about halfway through the game, I think I've seen almost every type of unit. I'm tediously plinking away at the skill tree and army upgrades, which means leaving one slot of my army vacant or else I lose 10-15 potential skill points from every single battle. (Sometimes I still lose some, as there's a few maps that give 2 units afterwards, but those are uncommon and hard to predict in advance.) The story is told in fairly nonsensical text dumps before battle referencing characters who I don't know. My main character has a bunch of spells that either waste his turn or hurt him horribly to cast *and* waste his turn. Defeated enemies continue taking up the last space they were in on the battlefield forever.And I have 26 battles left to go? No, I believe I would rather be playing LIMBO with the virtuous pagans instead of this.(As noted, I'm about halfway through the game in a little under 2 hours, having completed 21/47 of the battles at least once. Playing it at this point is actively painful and I think I will stop, rather than finish the game. I will update things if I do.EDIT: Haha, I came back to mine cards now that it has them, and the card patch deleted my save files. What an excellent game. Definitely not finishing it now!)"

,Not Recommended,473470,29895502,Posted: 13 February,all,KidwithSmurf,"Upon seeing this game in the store, it looked like it could be a fun, little turn based strategy game that costs hardly anything. However, upon playing the game, it is far from fun and here’s why:Pros:♦ Game concept is nice (Turn-Based with an army and upgradable skills)♦ Music seems fitting (Not repetitive or annoying, just fitting)♦ Army permanent death is great (This is great because it adds a challenging aspect to the game because if you lose an upgraded unit you must re-grind to get it back)♦ Enemy AI is decent (Great pathing and attack choices)♦ Steam Trading Cards♦ Price is cheap (This is good for what it is)Cons:♦ Very repetitive (After the third or fourth level you’ve pretty much seen and experienced everything in the game minus the skill upgrade spells which is really annoying as there is no incentive to play past the third or fourth level)♦ No Steam Achievements (A game released in 2016 on Steam that doesn’t have achievements makes me wonder…)♦ No real endgame or endgame story (This is because the map splits into multiple paths and doesn't force you to go a certain path. If you can beat the level you can go that path, this means the story is all over the place and once you beat every level nothing happens)♦ No real storyline (Like the last point, the story starts out of nowhere and goes nowhere)♦ Can't arrange your units before match start (This is annoying because units can't be put in formation to make it so ranged aren't spawned in front of melee)♦ No way to plan moves before making them (There should be some kind of system to know if I move to x square where I’ll be able to attack if I move there. Also, there should be a system to see if I attack x enemy unit with x unit of mine how much damage it will do to it. Knowing how much damage will be dealt would make planning which unit to attack which enemy unit with a lot easier, so I’m not wasting turns attacking an enemy unit only to deal less than half health when I could have killed it in one shot with another of my units).♦ No way to easily tell which unit has moved or attacked without selecting them when you have multiple (If you have a full army, it becomes really confusing to which units you have already moved and which ones you’ve attacked with. I found myself selecting units I’d already used numerous times which was very annoying)♦ Wall of text due to no voiceovers (This game would benefit highly from a voice actor to read the walls of text, to make them somewhat bearable)♦ Thunder God's Axe spell is relatively weak (Wastes a turn, does less damage to a group of enemies than it does recoil on yourself and overall pointless to use)♦ No way to increase enemies turn speed (This is annoying because when there is numerous enemies waiting for them to move takes ages and you spend half the time waiting for the enemies turn to be over)♦ No way to tell how far an enemy can attack, if it is ranged or how much damage it does (When versing new enemies for the first time, this makes it hard)♦ Big enemy sprites cover little enemy sprites (This is annoying because it makes it harder to move and attack when a larger enemy sprite is covering a smaller unit sprite of yours)♦ When units are in a massive group it's hard to see what unit is what and attack the correct one (Annoying when you are trying to see what enemies are what in a large group before attacking them and this makes it extremely hard to select the correct enemy to attack)♦ Using second move sometimes doesn't work (Certain times before I can use my second move on a unit I have to select another one and re-select the unit I want to move for the second time)♦ If you spend all your skill points upgrading your main unit's skill tree, other units in your army are irrelevant (This is annoying because it makes the army concept feel pointless)♦ No real graphics or PC settings (All it has is sound sliders and that's it. No graphics or resolution options etc)♦ No replayability (This is because there are no steam achievements, no storyline and no way to even reset your save file within the game to start over. This means once it’s finished, it’s finished and nothing makes you want to play it over)♦ Only limited units (This is terrible as there are only four or five different enemies to verse or units to gain in your army. Also, this makes the developer seem lazy as instead of adding new units to the game they just increased the amount you versed in a level)♦ No difficulty settings (A level is the same difficulty no matter whether you’ve brought every skill and upgraded your army to max or whether you haven’t spent a skill point yet. Annoying as you could stay at level one until you had enough skill points to fully unlock every skill as the difficulty doesn’t change as your units become stronger)♦ Very grindy (This is because you get to a level you can’t beat, you have to go back and redo the same lower level over and over again until you get enough skill points to be able to beat the next level. Also, every time you replay a level, everything stays the same)♦ Attack and moving animations are few and far between (There is hardly any animations here, the game would be soo much better if there were some variation in these)♦ Can’t replace army with different units gained if full (If your army is full and you beat a level you won’t gain a new unit or even have the option to replace an existing army unit with the new one. This is annoying because there should be an option)Overall, even though the game is only a dollar, has a good base concept and you will get some playability out of it, due to the high number of cons compared to pros I can’t recommend this game. Furthermore, I can’t recommend this as it is very repetitive, grindy, lacking an actual story and many other aspects."

Unfortunately, the game doesn't really throw anything new at you. Just enemies in more numbers with higher stats, no new types after the first two. I'm also pretty much convinced you don't need the team to win, but it's a good time if you're into basic team strategy.Oh yeah, if you're on Mac, you'll have to activate the program directly from the local files."
