Too short, far too short. Not a lot of replay value either as there is nothing else you need to unlock, no need to change your weapon layout …. Pitty, as it was fun for the short while."

My only major gripe with it is that the difficulty curve is pretty easy for most of the game with only one or two attempts at each level needed... until the last level. Then, possibly for lack of more content the difficulty is turned up to impossible. There are no more upgrade options left for my weapons and I've tried a number of configurations on the ship (all lasers looks cool but the game slows down to a crawl with them all firing).For what it is I'm happy to have paid 99p in the sale, its just a shame it doesn't go on for longer with a few more interesting options. I'm reccomending this purely on the fact that I enjoyed the 1.5 hours I spent on it but I probably won't be playing it again."

Its challenging and satisfying and plays similarly to the the browser game ""Orbital Decay"", which is quite a good thing.  There are a couple minor problems (spelling errors and somewhat repetitive sounds) and one major issue:  In the later levels with more enemies and more advanced turrets the game tends to slow way down to about half its normal speed and stay that way regardless of what happens on the screen until you return to the menus.  This leads to much slower and less fluid gameplay as well as surprisingly long breaks in the action.  This really needs to be fixed before I wholly reccomend the game.  The only other thing I can really say is that its really short (only seven or eight levels) and could probably be completed in an hour or two."

You start out in the standard spaceship with only the laser you the player controls without any turrents. Your told that you don't have enough firepower to actually win the current level your on and that you should try and get some turrents. Thats kinda hard since you dont start off with any money and you cant add turrents mid battle. So the first level starts you just have the lazer you control which is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥and you end up getting absolutely obliterated by the enemy faction the hunters. After the end of the level you realize you got some money and you can just barely afford a weak turrent you buy one and play the first level again. You get obliterated but gain some more money buy another weak turrent. Have another go at the first level get obliterated gain some money. Rinse Repeat Rinse Repeat and thats pretty much Cosmic Dust & Rust: playing the same level over and over again until you can actually beat it. Its boring its reptitive and it isn't worth a single cent much less a dollar. Refunded.

If the main cannon of a ""A Class Battleship"" can't even one shot a scout ship one hundreth the size of said battleship something must be very wrong somewhere. Hell, the laser blast was maybe five times the size of said scout ship!Got obliterated on the first level, bought a single laser turret with the money earned and proceeded to get obliterated again in almost the same spot. I guess I should've done side missions or something, or maybe I was actually supposed to grind the first level until I had enough money and energy for a proper setup of guns. Didn't really care enough to find out.Some immediate observations which made it feel not worth my time:- The back button in the settings menu was partially offscreen- At least some of the upgrades were missing their currency/power symbols or whatever was required to purchase them- Enemy ships were so tiny it took me maybe ten seconds to even realize they were there- Main cannon (the only cannon you can control?) felt so underpowered, it actually made me frown in disappointment- The gameplay I encountered immediately upon entering the game (first five minutes or so) just wasn't funMaybe if it was free I wouldn't feel so strongly about this, but as a game sold for real money (not much money, but still) it just didn't live up to my expectations.

You start off with a battleship equipped with one main cannon and as a result will most likely be massacred in the first level, but you keep all loot/side quest progress accumulated in a level after death, so you're able to beef up and tackle the level anew.

It's worth the few bucks to kill a bit of time and if the devs add content or make a longer second game it would be something I would be interested in.That being said, my major gripe with this game is the ships AI targeting.  I don't know if it's intentional to add difficulty, a bug, or just not smart.  In the last planet is where it becomes the most noticeable, and that's being the turrets target ships before anything else.  There will be large bases with turrets on the north/south side of my ship, just pummeling everything directly beside my craft.  Yet all my guns will be firing at the edge of the screen to kill the ships just coming into range/view.While I would have finished this game 35-40min, a fair length of enjoyable time for $1-2, because of this poor AI reaction I've been sitting on the last planet for 20-30min alone.  With a fully upgraded ship at this point I can just barely get to the end before I cannot keep up with the stations flying by without the help of the turrets to destroy the other stations turrets.

,Recommended,473560,23464207,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,Flying Shisno,"It's a nice little Tower Defense game. You have this big crimson ship with roughly 12 slots for turrets and 4 slots for power-ups. When it comes to turrets, there's 3 types: Rapid Fire Lasers, Beams, and Rockets. Then, you can upgrade each type from one of two of the next tier. So basically there's 3 Basic Tier-1  Turrets I mentioned earlier, then each Tier-1 Turret has to Tier-2 upgrades you can pick one of. I believe when you upgrade the Rocket, you can choose either the 'SAM Missile Launcher' or some kinda bazooka thing. In either case, it's a more powerful version.One thing to keep in mind is the resources: Gold, Aluminium, and Energy. Turrets cost Gold to purchase and require Energy to work. Inside the ships Internal Bay are several things that can be upgraded with Aluminium:There's Energy Node A and Energy Node B, which generate, you guessed it, Energy. The Energy Nodes can have their Energy Generation upgraded so you have more Energy to pull from when buying and upgrading Turrets, and all Internal Bay stuff has their energy requirements increased when upgraded. Also, Node A and Node B are seperate. For example, the first Energy Generation Upgrade costs 5 Aluminium, and gives a +50 Energy increase. So if you get the first upgrade for Node A for 5 Aluminium, you can get it again for Node B, getting an addition +50 Energy.The Engine, which decreases time to finish levels.The Main Cannon, which you can use to manually shoot stuff either not within range of your turrets, or for when you turrets are destroyed(more on this later). You can upgrade it's ""Mark"", but I'm not too sure what this dose yet. I think it increases rate of fire or projectile speed. I'll update this later when I figure it out.The HQ, which kinda upgrades all things around the ship kinda. Like all turrets and Internal Bay stuff has shields around it, and upgrading the 'Shields' portion at the HQ upgrades all shields. There's also a 'Mouse Magnet' upgrade option. When you destroy some ships, they drop Gold and Aluminium, which are attracted by the mouse.While all those Internal things have their own upgradable stuff, they ALL have a HP upgrade option, since all those Internal things can be targeted from the outside. At the far left side is the Engine, not too far ahead, in the center is the HQ, with Energy Node A & B above and below it, and the Main Cannon just right of HQ.Going back to the Turrets, you buy the in the External Bay menu in the Main Menu, and during a mission they can be destroyed, but come back at the end of the mission.This is a fun little Tower Defense game, especially for just $1, where I'd be willing to pay $5."

It aspires to be a tower defense / space shooter but the execution is not great. There are 6 ""levels"" to complete, each of which is the same space background with a different variety of bad guys. You earn upgrades to your weapons after each completed level but, unlike a true tower defense, placement of your equipment makes no difference and all the weapons take the same number of hits to eliminate enemies. There is virtually no story, and the little dialog available is terrible.I'm all about bang/buck but there are so many more indie titles that are more worthy of your spare change."

,Not Recommended,473560,23260725,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,Nardio,"Cheap but not worth it.Sure it's under 2 bucks, but the gameplay here is just bad. Six levels in total, five of which look exactly the same. I have yet to experience the sixth. No tutorial at all or help at all. When I first started playing I went to the in game story to look at weapons and power ups but had no in game currency to get them. So I jumped into level one expecting a tutorial and a way to make money. Maybe I would get weapons there. Nope.The only in game text in game happens during gameplay and is for the most part distracting and pointless. My first play through had me distracted reading text as tiny unbelievably hard to see little black ships snuck up to my ship and started attacking. Lots of them. I tried fighting them off with the main cannon but it wasn't enough. I found I wasn't able to summon cannons so I figured I had to play through the level with just my player controlled cannon. The in game text mentioned that the crew was working on adding guns for me to use and I just had to hold off the enemy forces...So I tried again being sure to pay attention. Sure enough again There were just to many to kill with my cannon. I couldn't figure out how to equip my other guns in game. It wasn't until after my third waste of time/play through of level one that I went back to the main store and sure enough I had enough money somehow to buy weapons for my ship.  I guess the developers had the idiotic idea that players should grind level one then know to go to the store and buy guns/equip them so they can beat level one.Really?One negative review of the game on Steam said it best:Bought it for $1 on sale. 30 seconds in to the first level there are too many NPC's and my gun is disabled. Ships 1/100th the size of yours need 5 shots to destroy.So my  first play throughs were pretty much you wasting time and earning money. This sets the tone for the game.Directionless and cheap.I had to grind this way to beat level 1.Repeat grinding several times for level 2.Repeat again for level 3.Repeat again for level 4.Repeat again for level 5.Get stuck on 5 after repeating to many times.Write this review and delete this crap.Weapons have no explanation of what they do and how much they hit for. You can barely see their specific shots in game so it's kind of a guessing game as to what to do. Later on I found out after grinding a bit that I could upgrade my guns a bit. They do better, but you still need to grind like crazy to make it through the later levels. It felt bland and empty. After all that frustration now, I won easily. Sure it was nice being able to get through some of the early levels easier, but it was still a grind and me fighting the same few ships over and over again.Level 5 has been my wall. Try, die, upgrade, try again, upgrade, try again and upgrade. This isn't fun. I've gone to the forums to check out what works and apparently the answer is all green lasers.Really?Then I'm reading all green lasers got nerfed.  So thats not working.Really?I'm not in the mood to replay the game a few dozen times more to max out my ship parts to then hit a wall to try and figure out which nondescript weapons will work on clearing the final two levels. That's pointless grinding and time wasted. You need to buy each weapon and pay to upgrade them each time in game. So in theory if there is a magical set and arrangement for these nondescript weapons I need to replay and grind this crap game over and over again as I buy, upgrade and try them over and over again and see what allows me to survive the onslaught.Not fun.Any way lets go into a bit on the very deceptive description for this game:Cosmic Dust & Rust is a tower defence game set in space. Upgrade your ship, build turrets and defence systems, undergo side missions and take control of your ship manually and use its cannons and super weapons to destroy your enemies.So Cosmic Dust & Rust is a sort of tower defense game. You have ship and over time you can equip guns and upgrade everything on it.Now ""undergo side missions"" is a bit of a misnomer. You don't. While you play the game you earn in game currency just by playing it. It's called ""Side Missions"" but it's really just the game keeping track of various set objectives that are about how much of so and so you kill or how often you use so and so skill. There is no real, leave the game campaign behind and do a side mission here.""and take control of your ship manually and use its cannons and super weapons to destroy your enemies.""This one. This one here is what hooked me.  I thought this was going to be me manually piloting my ship some how and having an active role in how the level is played out..... No... Not really. In Cosmic Dust & Rust from the very first level you are in control of the ships main cannon. This is normal gameplay. Not ""and take control of your ship manually"" as if it were bonus play on top of the normal tower defense formula here. Later on you can use two special skills to help you further along. But the game never shows you how to use said skills. I bought and installed the ion cannon and the shield and didn't figure out how to get them to work until level four when I started tapping random keys out of frustration. 3 & 4 on my keyboard all of a sudden became useful. The cool down on these are painfully long frustrating. I wouldn't say using these power ups and the ships main cannon count as something unique here. It just feels like regular active gameplay in a tower defense game. This isn't anything new nor is it me taking control.So far I've spent over 2 hours playing Cosmic Dust & Rust and it feels like a colossal waste of time. This is sorta like a masochistic flash game that feels like it was released midway through development. From what I read in the earlier reviews the game was short but enjoyable. I could do that. Then some reviews were saying that it just didn't have the amount of content to justify the asking price. Since then the developer has updated the game and I think I am playing the boring and grindy results. Instead of adding more levels and fleshing out the game, they just made it harder.It's six frakin levels.Why do that to a six level game? This is made in GameMaker. It's not hard to make new levels in GameMaker. Hell just copy paste some levels and adjust the amount of ships and call it a day. It not like the levels here stand out at all or there are unique sequences of events. It's an enemy wave defense game with ships that all look alike and blend together. Put some more effort into this.I could go on, but this is just frustrating. I was really hoping the developers of Cosmic Dust & Rust would listen to the reviews and comments on the Steam store, and then I came across this comment.conradproteus  [developer] May 21 @ 4:12pmFor 2$ what did you expect? we are indie and we tryd to get some funds from this so that we can make sequal with more features and contentSo instead of making the best game they can, they just wanna up and abandon it for a better sequel.Screw this game."

Takes less than an hour to reach the last level but that's fine given the pricing. Has that addictive flash game quality, where everything is pretty simple and you just play it through to upgrade everything.The negatives listed aren't actually all that big a deal, the only REAL issues I had with the game is I felt like it could have been stretched out a bit, even if that just meant recylced content.  Chuck in a few more levels and upgrades, and let the players upgrade to the point where the last level is easy. Games like this only have difficulty depending on what upgrades you have, since there's very little you can do to manually increase the effectiveness of your ship."

Tiny black dots assail you while the only gun which can fire back (at least before many upgrades, only got to level 2) are you main gun. Therefore you crappy and seemingly useless low-level turrets get destroyed. So it's a game about hunting small black dots against a black space background. Simply incorrect tutorial text (press right mouse button to fire? The picture is of the left mouse button...) and poor localisation into English also grates. I would play this for a bit as a free flash game, I am not personally convinced it is worth money."

Not bad for a dollard but it is a little bit underpar of an experience and probably does not belong on steam but rather on a flash games site.Tactical defense is a sidescroll shootemup against massive waves of tiny ships as well as larger capital ships, then to as backup fire you can mount additional turrets and get some HP upgrades for the ship. Sound clips loop too much especially at the shop, the visuals are alright, as far as I could tell there are 7 levels, but I had to fully grind the ship to beat level 6. After level 5 or so you are no longer given new turret upgrades and the game becomes punishingly hard, and because everything is maxed out you can no longer really progress at all. Maybe I am just not good at the game but I was using all tlhe power ups, also there seems to be quite a few unused slots on the ship that look like they should have upgrades on. That gives the impression that the whole thing is slightly unfinished, as if it was lacking another level of upgrades and customizability."

I enjoy having the static defense and the big gun I can control.Now for the negatives, there's very little to do. As another poster said, in about an hour you'll do everything the game offers.The amount of gold/aluminum you get is silly. I currently have a giant pile of gold I can't spend because I've upgraded all my hardpoints but I don't have nearly enough aluminum to upgrade the internals.The shield is frustrating to use. I hate having to move my mouse back over my ship messing up my aim just to put out a shield.Its an ok game for about $2 but as someone else mentioned, there are free games as good or better."
