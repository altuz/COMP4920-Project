There's NOTHING original here, except for the dolls itself. It's basically a reskin of the original game, which even the developer says that its true. He says it has  a ""different theme and slightly different AI.""The models are as well Unity store assets, meaning they didn't even bother to do it from scratch. The music from the intro is not even original either, its from a Youtube video which contains custom made doll music.The GUI is cheap as well. You press a rectangle with ""camera"" written on it, and a outline of the building pops up on your face. No animation of a camera, nothing. They didn't even bother to do an transition to the camera.If you like FNaF, don't get this game, its a horrible cash grab trying to profit off the FNaF idea.If you don't like FNaF, don't get this either. It's a ton more inferior experience.Scott Cawthon has been contacted as well, and he said he's going to take this game down. I don't feel bad for the developers at all, since they just tried to do a quick cash grab."

It's Five Nights at Freddy's with dolls and I don't mean that by way of ""Wow, Thanos is a lot like Darkseid, isn't he?"". I mean thatthis is Five Nights at Freddy's with dolls, from the lights, doors and limited power survival mechanics, right down to the introductory phone call that you get at the beginning of each night. There's no twist, no innovation, this could not be more of a clone if Count Dooku had got it packaged in his bulk discount from Kamino.It's entirely competent. There's no bugs or pedantically unfair gameplay quirks to speak of. The nightmarish soundtrack is probably the high point of it all; a swirling disconcerting stew of mechanical grunts, violin shrieks and hideous doll laughter. The whole FNAF genre isn't really my style but, speaking objectively,The Dollsdoes its job fairly well.So, why the thumbs down? Well, if I re-released Call of Duty and all I did was re-skin the Nazis into Zulu warriors and then charged you for the experience, do you think that would be okay? If you bought my new game Cattlefield: Bad Cowpany and you were immediately struck by the haunting feeling that you'd played it before, aside from the fact that there were now a pair of hooves clutching the weapons instead of human hands, would you give that a positive review?What makes this even worse is the presence of Mark Hann. If you're unfamiliar with the unscrupulous practices of his former company Dark Day Interactive, the following article spells it out plain as day:http://cliqist.com/2016/04/20/darkest-day-drama-of-dark-day-interactive/TL;DR: DDI are responsible for the unfinished, abandoned Steam nightmares known as One Final Breath, Once Bitten Twice Dead and GASP, all whilst launching near-infinite amounts of Kickstarter campaigns to try and bleed grossly inflated amounts of their backer's money out of them before knocking together the barest of playable experiences out of stolen asset packs and lying to their employees about pay.You can find another (much shorter) summary of their continuing nonsense specifically with this game here:http://cliqist.com/2016/04/25/mark-hann-dark-day-interactive-the-dolls/I really wouldn't expectThe Dollsto be here much longer anyway, seeing as FNAF creator Scott Cawthon has recently expressed his desire to have this erased from Steam.

,Not Recommended,473670,23240928,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,LadyTenjoin,"Gist of the storyThe player character is a security guard hired to watch over a toy store factory owned by Cooper & Son Co. Apparently, the toy town closed 50 years ago for reasons unknown to the public so its sudden reopening quirks some eyebrows. However, the grand reopening will bring in jobs to the town the store resides in so everyone wins, right? Kids will have their toys and the adults will have some jobs available. Perfect…until the night guard begins his shift and realizes that toys are indeed possessed.Yup…$30 /hour to protect a place with roaming, teleporting, demonic doll things.---GameplayThe game consists of surviving the night, fending off the possessed dolls. The security guard will receive a phone call at the beginning of each night with a brief narration on what is happening around the factory. Of course, he is trapped in a room with two points of entry, a left and a right door. He can close the doors to prevent any dolls from entering the room and turn on the lights by the entrance of said doors to check whether or not they’re nearby. There is a power system that controls the lights and the doors so when the power runs out, say goodbye to your only form of defense. He can also check the cameras to keep a watchful eye on various checkpoints around the place (If this sounds familiar, then you have not been living under a rock. Congratulations.)They are audio cues. Sometimes the dolls would laugh, sometimes they would cry. There are visual cues as well. The dolls would appear in front of the door as a first warning that they are ready to eat your soul. Yeah…The hours of the night will gradually increase. For example, Night 1 will have you only surviving for 3 hours and Night 5 for 6 hours.That’s basically it. Just survive the night. (You’re still reading…great)---Did ya scare me?The scare factor of the game, on the scale of 1-10 (1 being, “me looking for something to scare me but couldn’t find it, no matter how hard I tried” and 10 being, “I ♥♥♥♥ my pants, I should’ve worn a diaper”), I rate The Dolls a 1 out of 10.Unfortunately, each night is the same. I played up to Night 6 and I didn’t feel the doll’s aggressiveness change over time. I saw about 3 different kinds of dolls but to be honest, I think their jumpscare cutscenes are the same. I saw a monkey, a generic plastic doll and another generic plastic roll but this one is rocking back and forth. It has a cute laugh so I can’t be mad at the Rocker Doll.The sounds are decent but at times, they were simply inserted in certain points of the night just to make things more dramatic than it seems.Other than that, there’s nothing new or exciting about how The Dolls frightens the player.---Graphics and Technical IssuesThe game hasn’t crashed on me yet so that’s a plus. There is some kind of film grain that makes it look like an old VHS recording but it’s bearable. There might be some conflict with Windows 10 users but I’m not quite sure. Look at the Steam forums if you want to know more about it.---Wrap UpI’ve been avoiding calling it a “FNAF clone.” I probably should’ve just started with that and most people would know what I am referring to. If you’re a fan of FNAF you can give this a shot if you want. I will not stop you. Just know that it brings nothing new to the table.---TL;DRPros:-Decent sounds-FNAF clone (depending on whether or not you see this as a pro or con)Cons:- Each night felt the same.- The game didn’t elicit any frightening moments for me-The dolls weren’t varied in how they scare the player-FNAF clone (depending on whether or not you see this as a pro or con)-Might have conflict with Windows 10 (Look at Steam Forums for more information)---If you stuck around me this long, and if you have the time, watch me fool around in The DollsThe Dolls"
,Not Recommended,473670,31437835,Posted: 29 April,all,CorvusCorax,"It appears this game was originally a clone of Five Nights at Freddy's. As there were some legal issues because of this the game was taken down. Later on it was published once more on Steam under the title Reborn. Now, the problem with this is that the only way for them to have it up was to change the gameplay and eliminate the similarities as much as possible.Instead of being bound to a desk having the ability to check the cameras showing each room in this factory we are free to walk wherever we please. This, however, kills the gameplay since the monitors are in the office and they indicate how close the dolls are - to the office. So, your best bet is to go back there and close the 2 doors whenever you feel it necessary. The 2 doors, by the way, along with the quickly draining power bar are still items very similar to FNaF.I played an hour or so with this game and was not able to figure out when the dolls are coming. It is also pretty annoying that they teleport into the office - even the store page mentions this ability of theirs. Then what's the point? Towards the end of the 1st shift (night) I had a couple of mins left and decided to close the doors but the doll immediately jumped onto me. For me it is unclear if the doors serve as real protection when closed.When roaming our flashlight barely helps. The corridors are barely lit and even the torch drains our power. I met a couple of dolls along the way but they were completely harmless. With the exception of going through them, that is. It is nice to see them looking into the camera from above but once you are outside you cannot find them positioned this way. It appears the game separates the roaming part from the office area in terms of gameplay.Since I was not able to figure out how to complete my first shift (after the training) I did not find any sense in playing the so-called insane mode which, of course, makes everything more difficult. What is pretty annoying is that the store page still has the trailer for the original Dolls - feel free to check any videos on YouTube showing gameplay for the original (which seems pretty cool).For me Dolls Reborn is a failed attempt to cash in on something similar. If you want to borrow an idea make some changes to make sure the developer of the original idea cannot have any claims against you. But don't make changes that completely remove the atmosphere and provide an annoying gameplay just so you can keep your game afresh. Elaborating on the rest of the issues with this title I'll simply skip (e.g. Unity assets, bad graphics, lots of typos in the store page synopsis) as I have already done so during many reviews pertaining to similar ""quality"" software."

I personally find dolls a lot more scary than furries, and this game better than FnaF.Although it could've been a lot more enjoyable if it wasn't to the terrible Gamma brightness and colours. It's either too dark, or too grey, it hurt my eyes it made it unplayable."

And again....about an hour of attempts to get past the non-tutorial night. Consider this more of a sideways thumb than down.I don't like to start off completely negative so let me say what I DID like about this game:1. The idea was neat. While I found it similar to that other title that people are freaked out about, I found that it is different enough to have it's own identity as a security guard jump scare sort of game.2. I like that the clock moves! It's really nice to see how far I've made it into the night instead of being a big mystery(I'm looking at you, Emily Wants To Play).3. The dolls themselves were very creepy and well done(though I think they were just Unity assests?).4. I liked the freedom of movement. It was neat to explore!Now the bad:I gotta be honest and say that it is very frustrating to say the least. The game doesn't seem to follow it's own rules which are basically: Watch out for dolls and shut the doors if you see any.However, I was killed many times when there were no dolls in sight and there were no audio cues to even indicate that one could be nearby but unseen.So either the mechanics aren't really working as intended or there is some weird RNG mechanic that spawns dolls in the room even when the doors are closed. Yes, I've gotten killed in an empty room with the doors closed.It doesn't even make the screaming noise everytime they get you. I just see a baby head and the game over prompt that restarts the night or returns me to the menu.Finally, my whole game kind of had this sort of fuzzy brown hue which made things a little to bright and blurry for me. I think this is intended, but it would be nice to get a brightness or contrast slider on the little launch tool before the game starts so I can adjust it a bit. It is a little hard on my eyes(I'm old).All of that being said, I can't recommend this game right now. I plan on returning in a couple months since I usually dust these off around Halloween and I'll give it a shot again. Maybe there will be a couple tweaks that will make the experience a bit smoother for me. I have faith in the Devs and look forward to someday changing my review for the better.Edited: Spelling is hard at 6 A.M. :P"

Тот же FNaF, который я считаю убогим, из-за тупых скримеров, и бестолкового кликанья, лучше чем эта игра! Здесь все тоже самое только в 10 раз хуже.Скримеры. Это даже скримером назвать стыдно! Они не имеют никакого звукового сопровождения, просто у тебя перед лицом, выползает голова куклы и все! Они сделаны убого и очевидно. Перед появлением такого скримера герой замирает на месте, центрируется камера и только через секунду появляет голова куклы (мартышка меня почему то не ловила)В отличии от FNaF нам теперь можно ПЕРЕДВИГАТЬСЯ по локации! Ну ок... Зачем?? В чем смысл?? Мы даже не можем убежать или спрятаться (хотя имеется спринт). Все что нам надо делать, это передигаться к дверям от одной стены комнаты к другой, чтобы нажать кнопку! Можно конечно побродить поизучать локацию, но тебя все равно поймает ""скример""!От камер, для наблюдения за куклами, пользы никакой. Чтобы знать что происходит надо сначала заучить локацию за пределами комнаты, но даже в этом случае от камер пользы нет! Потому что Куклы появляются в рондомных точках и у них нет последовательности преследования!Графика. Графика тут сильно замылена. Если на скриншотах она выглядит любопытно и атмосферно, то на деле это ужас коорый издевается над глазами с первых минут игры.Звуки и музыка. Музыка в главном меню хорошая и атмосферная, да и звуки сделаны качественно не смотря на отсутсвие звука скримера. Пожалуй это единственный плюс.Я купил эту игру не из-за низкой цены, а потому что посмотрев скриншоты, и не прочитав обзоры, решил что это что то интересное. Я ошибся. Ну уж черт с ним. Из-за 12 рублей запрашивать возврат это смешно.Ребят, Серьезно. Не покйпайте эту игру. Ее карточки не отобьют цену. А если хотите собрать значок, то лучше купить их отдельно.Не рекомедую никому.

The only thing you need to do in this game is opening and closing doors and escaping the dolls when the power run off. No challange at all. Boring as hell. No puzzles, no effort in the story, just a huge amount of useless gameplay. I can't tell you how bad it is... It doesn't worth any money at all. Even the jumpscares are lame. This is a purchase you will surely regret. Don't buy it."
,Not Recommended,473670,23316376,"Posted: 31 May, 2016",all,f.,"When I first heard about The Dolls and it's similarity to FNAF I was excited to play what I felt could be a great new twist on the jumpscare genre which was becoming fairly stale, however after playing it the excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I learned that the game wasn't so much in the FNAF style but rather a direct copy of it with a few tiny tweaks in the form of using dolls and the layout.To be unbiased I must admit that the game did scare me multiple times, a bit of that was due to how loud my headphones were but I'd be lying if I didn't say there was no tension while playing, so in that regard I'd give the game a thumbs up to anyone looking for a cheap scare.Overall though I can't really recommend the game as it brings nothing new to the table and seems like a fairly shameless attempt to ride the FNAF hype, there's a difference between taking an idea and using it to build on and create your own style & just changing a few things and having an identical copy, in that regard this game is like ordering an iPhone and getting some cheap ripoff.Here's a video of some gameplay for anyone interested:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdVvTrQhHkQ"
76561198048974498,Recommended,473670,23220381,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,rjmacready,"Okay, so I'm pretty sure I don't need to tell you that this is yet, yet another Five Nights at Freddy's rip-off. So what you REALLY wanna know is...how does it stack up, next to not only the FNAF games, but the absolute plethora of FNAF clones we've had since the first game's debut (way, way back in late 2014)? Well, the first thing I'll state, right up, no holds barred, and absolutely no-♥♥♥♥in'-doubt-about-it, is that this is THE SINGLE MOST BLATANT FREDDY RIP-OFF YET. And I'm confident that I've damn well nearly played 'em all by now...You're a security guard. You're employed to look after a place full of sentient, malevolent toys, after hours. You're sitting in an office. You look left, where there's a door with two buttons: a lock and a light. You look right, same thing. Your shift starts at midnight. You must make it to 5 or 6am without any of the toys getting in the room and ""jump-scaring"" you to death (I make no apologies for not remembering the specific time right now, the deja vu really is coming that thick and fast). You also have an on-screen electrical power level, which saps down from 100% to 0% - 0% not being good - every time you bring up a camera (to check where the toys are), hit a door light (to see if something is standing just outside your room), or close a door. And to top it all off, some guy keeps calling you on the phone to welcome you to your new job, and advise you about what to do next to survive.So far, so Freddy's.So what arguable improvements or innovations does this game make over the first FNAF? Well, I suppose the cameras pan around a bit more, and the dolls themselves are a tad more animated. Having said that, the jump-scares aren't nearly as scary, the gameplay doesn't seem as tactical, and one of the two door lights doesn't even seem that terribly necessary, given that you can clearly see outside said door anyway (maybe this changes later on, but I frankly couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed to find out).Overall, and in all honesty, I'd be lying if I told you that I feel even the slightest bit compelled to persist with this one right now. I'm yet to even get to the final hour of Freddy's the first (though I've come damn close), and this is much too similar to justify wasting time on it instead. My simple advice? Only buy this one, on sale, if you've already conquered the original FNAF (and probably all the sequels as well), and are absolutely dying for an inferior game with an almost identical premise and gameplay. The thumb-up is for you people who fit this description, and you people alone.Everyone else: Start with Freddy's 1, humour some of the better clones like Sophie's Curse, Boogeyman, and Bear Haven Nights...and if you still have a hard-on for such shenanigans, by all means give this one a whirl. From what little I've played so far, it's by no means the most incompetent of its type (hello, 123 Slaughter Me Street), but at least all the other Freddy wannabes had the common decency to change things up A LITTLE. Scott Cawthon could seriously sue over this one, and I'd be happy for him to use this half-arsed review of mine as testimony in court.There's ""homage"", and then there's...this. It's not quite insulting, but it's more than a tad on the cheeky side. Here's hoping HUSH Interactive find at least one original idea in their teeny, tiny minds between now and their next game, but if they're not open to such suggestions, I for one would love to see a slavish remake of the first Silent Hill. Just sayin'...Verdict: 6.5/10."

You may ask? You see I like the FNAF games, 'fnaf1' the most and it was mostly due to it being the first FNAF game I've played. The Dolls by Hush Interactive may as well be a straight rip from FNAF one. Guard on nightshift, sitting in one spot watching two doors, camera's, lights and door shutters, phone call at the start of each night anyone? Being called a clone wouldn't be that far off, its a very close copy (many clones are free BTW). I wouldn't have normally marked it down for being unoriginal and being so close to a game, I enjoy it couldn't be a thumbs down. Afterall FNAF one got my praise. The game (The Dolls) itself I like.What breaks it for me (thanks to The Fragnostic) for the heads up. Is questionable practices from the then Dark Day Interactive, renamed Hush Interactive.Source:http://cliqist.com/2016/04/20/darkest-day-drama-of-dark-day-interactive/To further inform, current issues about copyright and Scott Cawthon. Seems Scott has taken a very public disapproving look on the Dolls. As I'm not a lawer nor an expert on copyright, IMHO in layman's terms it seems to be a very gray area. Interesting to see how or if it all pans out? The Dolls clearly has the FNAF touch and feel about it, its currently a brick by brick FNAF one copy, but without any use of Scott's assets and or passing off their work as Scott's and charging for it. Only possible legal/court action will settle it."

They are darkly lit, hard to highlight. Trying to patrol them as if you were a guard in a high security nanothech lab wont work. You get jumped it makes no sense. So backtrack to the office where you get two entrances and two half lit rooms leading out of it. Defending that aint so bad. You can close each room individually. Staying in office and closing doors when music gets loud seemed to do the trick. Especially since visuals seems to blink into darker shades and usually thats when you get jumped by a insta-death scripted scene. I was getting bored on mission two so I just experimented venturing out between moments where the music was freaking out. Just outside the office on the first room.

Well, I'm here to tell you that it isn't. Yes, it is very similar to said other game, but it has its own unique features. First-off, this game is free-roam. Not just around your office, but around the facility. Also, instead of just closing the doors to keep them out, you can also run away from them. At least, I think you can. I haven't played very much, yet. My only real complaint with this game would be that annoying warmified overlay that plagues your vision during all gameplay. Looking at the game by itself, rather than in comparison to other games of this ilk, I rate it 7/10."

So if you've got time to kill (lol)then this game is perfect for you.Here's the first part of the game from my YouTube channel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT_Vquy9VlI&feature=youtu.be"

Are you someone that's able to see past the fact that a game is yet another clone of something that's been done many times before? If you answered yes to either of these, then I would recommend giving The Dolls a try.Funny Moments & Gameplay -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JcbAWbmZLcThe Dolls doesn't bring anything new to the table, but as a fan of indie horror games, I still had a lot of fun with it. You can't go into it expecting a completely new and revolutionary experience, though, because that's not what you're getting. You're essentially getting FNAF 1 wrapped in different packaging, but with all of the same trimmings. That said, the fact that it has dolls instead of animatronics is, for me at least, considerably more unnerving. I don't know what it is about those little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but every time I look at one I just want to smash its little doll face.For the small asking price of $3.74, I definitely think it's worth checking out if you're a fan of the genre.Cheers guys :)"

I don't think I played a game that scared the holy crap out of me this bad, Jump scares yes and to be honest this game makes Five Nights at Fredy's child's play *pun intended* this is a game ment for VR but I think they would pull it from Steam after the game gives people a heart attack and kills more people than Diablo 3 has with people playing 30+ hours straight."
