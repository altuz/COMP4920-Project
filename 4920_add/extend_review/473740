76561198006413390,Recommended,473740,34257572,Posted: 15 August,all,woosk,"This kinetic visual novel with fanservice by 7DOTS and Dagestan Technology feature a male protagonist Ackbar who was called by a female friend Linda to fix her laptop. While fixing her laptop, Linda made an offer to Ackbar to get intimate with her for her to win a bet she made with her friends. After sleeping with Linda, Ackbar found himself in a mysterious new location. Upon further investigation, he found the new place to be called the Crystal City for being a city where the walls of every building are clear and transparent and he has been prescribed a wife Linda to stay with. As Ackbar settles into his new surroundings in the Crystal City, he discovers that the place and the wife who was prescribed to him by a doctor are not as ideal as he hoped.Having played through Dagestan Technology's earlier visual novelsRussian Horror StoryandSpakoyno: Back to USSR 2.0, I would say this visual novel is the best visual novel title among Dagestan Technology's visual novel offerings, with greatly improved CGs and character sprites, improved script and plot based on a futuristic dystopian setting with mystery and supernatural themes that progress well and are easy to follow and great soundtracks by Helly Tree and tieff. Recommended when game is at discount or in bundle offer with possible soundtrack DLC release in future as it takes less than 10 hours to get all achievements by playing through an optional puzzle minigame, completing a point and click adventure segment and completing the kinetic visual novel."

76561197994273865,Recommended,473740,34494936,Posted: 25 August,all,Requiem,"I'm a bit on the fence about this one.  The art is nice but there's a grand total of 9 eroge screen, no variations and they are overall quite tame (even with the adult unlock).  I like my VN to combine decent eroge with decent story, otherwise I can read a book or watch porn to get one without the other.  So anyway, don't pick this one up for the ecchi, BUT, the story is actually decent and interesting: AI, future distopia, body swapping, etc.  The english is fairly bad and not translated well, but it's good enough to understand the intent.  I got it on special and I don't regret it...  I just wish there was more... of everything.  The potential is huge."
,Recommended,473740,35179034,Posted: 24 September,all,Back in a week or smth,"Crystal City is a rather short VN, however, it attempts to build a universe, and almost succeeds. The characters also receive some minor background story.It would appear that the developer is hoping to release a sequel, which might build even more onto the universe they created.I would recommend Crystal City to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive VN with linear story progression, it also has some mini-games which I found particularly fun.Final Score: 7/10"
76561198069159152,Recommended,473740,34355913,Posted: 19 August,all,wrb41977,"This is a quick little game, with only two real areas where you interact. One is a minigame that can be accessed on the main menu, and the other is a small click and complete puzzle. There is a ""cheat"" code that unlocks more explicit pictures in certain scenes, but frankly, the storyline is rather... fan-servicy.Anyway, fine for what it is. (Also, Crystal City seems to be the first ""chapter"" in a ""Stop The Earth, I'm Getting Off"" series.)"

Apart from the sexual content, the story itself is also engaging. I would definately wait for the latter ones from this series."
76561198073081384,Recommended,473740,34479337,Posted: 25 August,all,SleepingFool,"Normal rating: 2/10Enjoyability: 7,5/10If you're looking for some deep stuff or awesome gameplay you're on the wrong side of internet. But if you're looking for some fun and fanservice this is the game for you. I honestly think that this is better than sakura games, but that is a matter of taste. I like it more mainly because of original setting where you literally ♥♥♥♥ your way to distopian world full of sex.Things you may want to know:- There are no decisions.- There are 2 minigames nothing special, but ok."
,Recommended,473740,33512354,Posted: 13 July,all,Sad Guy,"This novel is full of many references as to various films and interesting facts, and to many other things. The reference to the anime Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanojo is as good as it is possible at all.   The drawings deserve special praise. And of course an excellent musical accompaniment. I advise everyone to buy and pass this novel, I'm sure you will not waste time in vain. I will look forward to the next story out of the cycle."

On one hand, it is has both funny dialog and fairly original sci-fi concepts. On the other hand, the story is very short and needs a English proofreader.Overall I think the experience was positive if you don't equate money with duration."
76561198291155373,Recommended,473740,33963677,Posted: 1 August,all,Sunny,"Just finished this visual novel, and will add to positive rep its gotten so far. Got it pretty cheap but was interesting to read due to the premise that just having sex with certain people will apparently teleport you to some different dimension. Without going too much into the story it starts off quite slow and start to like some characters, only thing I didn't like was how near the end of this novel or least this part of the series, chunks and chunks of information is being fed to you by the spoonful, not really letting things settle and really off put me when reading one part of information only for something else to be added upon that. Scenes were nice and humor was good hit miss some of the time as well.I say get it if you have the discount for it, or want to read something for a few hours."

Buy it if you like VNs."

Went rather to far in the sexual dirrection but the depth of the world that it created and the actual detail to following a story it was actually rather nice.Woulldn't pay full price for this but if you can get it cheap I would say that it might be worth it, ""might be""."

76561198011799774,Not Recommended,473740,33565100,Posted: 15 July,all,foxtrotter69,"I liked that this ""game"" is a novel. I disliked that this novel was advertised as a game. I feel like I am halfway through, but it is hard to tell. If I could just read text in a novel format, this would improve the novel tremendously. Overall, I do not recommend this as a game, but if you like to read for entertainment, this story may be what you are looking for. Just don't expect a ton of interaction, or choices to make. Expect to read."

I would like to view the next episodes also.The ( soft )  sexual content is enjoyable, the minigames are funny!Completely worth the money"
,Recommended,473740,34206842,Posted: 12 August,all,ToiletROCK,"Got a 90% discount from a crafted coupon. As a start, the art is well-drawn; the story is well-written although the English version isn't perfect but still readable and understandable, nonetheless. The premise of the story is... interesting and there is quite a number of scenes of fan service. The music is pleasant and fits the story theme well. The addition of the two mini-games adds some zest to the otherwise linear gameplay, which is basically read the novel from start to finish. Achievements are related and isn't too terribly difficult to get, even for those related to the minigames. Overall, it is a pretty short but decent visual novel. I wouldn't buy it at its market price. I feel it's slightly overpriced for the amount of content you are getting. Probably best to get it when it's on sale or if you have a crafted coupon for it."

Honestly, I bought this game because I had a 90% off coupon (You can probably buy one for cheap if you don't want to pay the full price ;)). Got into this game without many expectations, not knowing what was up ahead. I had never really played a game like this and was surprised by how much I actually liked this game. I had 4 hours of fun!The game (Is it a game though) is more of an novel that you read. The story isn't too good but it's not bad either.Cons:- Lots of grammar mistakes- Not interactive (apart from 2 mini-games)Pros:- Lovely music- Great artIf you love a laid-back game with lots of reading, this is something for you!"
