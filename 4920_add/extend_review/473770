,Recommended,473770,29449009,Posted: 23 January,all,ThatSabineGirl,It's basically Wipeout. This is a GOOD THING. Plus it's free. Nostalgia for the PS1 era without having to mess with emulators or dig your PS1 out of storage. Works great with an xinput controller. I reckon they deserve a couple of quid for their patreon too tbh. I wanna see what they make next.
76561198330832611,Recommended,473770,29977292,Posted: 16 February,all,Snek,"After the closing of Studio Liverpool, there was a sinking feeling I would never get to see another WipEout game atleast for a long time, and while the Omega collection is coming, it's more of what I have played, but the this game came out as a light of hope, bringing with it new tracks and new challenges. At first the old WipEout handling was all new to me, but now I love it. I have now played the first WipEout game and I feel they took the better handling engine from the old WipEouts and gave it the more forgiving nature of walls in the new WipEout games. Which overall is better, hitting a wall certainly is not desirable and does dish out a proper punishment to your time, however I feel I don't need to restart a race for grazing the exit of a turn.  In WipEout 1 hours of frustration made you learn the track in and out to even progress, and while that had it's own merits of making the game a great challenge, it was mostly a crutch for making you stay playing the lack of content for longer. It is something that would not go down very well in the modern industry where exessively hard games do not go down well. This game takes that out, while still having an emphasis on trying to learn a track, it no longer forces you to play it for hours to learn the track. It also fixes the issue the old WipEouts had that the difficulty compensated for, the lack of tracks to keep you occupied if you blew threw them on your first attempt. With more tracks available now than in the any of the old WipEouts, as well as workshop and track builder, we won't be lacking tracks soon. As well as taking the great handling of the old WipEout games, they have gone the extra mile of offering the new handling from the Pure and on games, which is very appreciated as they were what I entered the series on. All this paired with the great retro style graphics running at modern resolutions, this is far better than an emulator could ever offer. The only thing really missing here is, well, WipEout, it doesn't use the old teams we know and love, for obvious reasons, but mods can and are helping that, it's just a shame Sony closed Studio Liverpool. I would like to see these developers try to make a lore similar to WipEout's but the game is fine without it, and for free, it's more than worth the download."

,Recommended,473770,29736686,Posted: 5 February,all,Mr. Dat,"A must-have Wipeout 2097 era cover that hits exactly the right spots in both presentation and gameplay. There was something very special about the original Wipeout games, with design impact on AG racers similar to how Quake III influenced arena shooters; I am joyous to say the developers succeeded in recapturing this magic inside BallisticNG.Perfect controls, adjustable PSX-class visuals, recognizable sounds with a typical electro soundtrack and a stylish UI that hits home. A project that certainly deserves more exposure and financial support as it is clearly on the right track with immediate and well deserved cult status."
76561197977513249,Recommended,473770,29615379,Posted: 31 January,all,mac82122,"Wow. This game brought back some great memories. If you are even slightly interested in the old Wipeout series on the Playstation, then you must add this to your collection. It's a mixture of Wipeout, Wipeout XL (2097) , Wipeout 3 & Wipeout HD Fury all in one great package and it's free !! Some great techno tunes really add to the retro feel. I'm running it at 4k with everything maxed @60fps on an i5 6600k & 980 Ti. I've only played 1 hour as I just downloaded it to see what it looked like after being disappointed so many times over the years with other Wipeout clones, but I can definitely say I will be playing lots more hours in the future. This is the best version I've seen bar none. It ran perfectly with an Xbox One controller without having to reprogram the buttons. Add this game to your collection, you won't be sorry you did."

76561198087239262,Recommended,473770,29752998,Posted: 6 February,all,GrimD_Jak,"Coming from wipeout HD with maybe 88-100 hours of practice(very small), playing this game on a ps4 controller feels natural to me,I recommend this to anyone that has played a AG racing game such the wipeout series or anyone who missed out on it and wants to give it a try.Edit:i Strongly suggest a game pad be used to play this game,you need to mess with the controller binds if you want to get that wipeout feel for the handling such as left and right airbrakes for tighter turns at higher speeds,without knowing those you'd smack walls constantly on zen speed."
,Recommended,473770,29492946,Posted: 25 January,all,NatParable,"The dev's commitment to the PS1 aesthetic is commendable! Low rez textures, low poly models, short draw distance, vertex snapping, and the ability to play at lower resolutions in fullscreen without messing up your desktop...it's great! Looks and feels just like an old PS1 game!"

,Recommended,473770,35213920,Posted: 25 September,all,★black_sn0w★,"This is a very excellent game for the price (I paid $5, $8 is still great). There are physics and difficulty options for the newbie or expert alike. The default physics are spot-on just like old Wipeout games and the controls are very responsive even when I use a keyboard. There is also a 2280 mode with physics that more resemble the newer Wipeout titles. The mod support along with built-in editors is icing on the cake. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes either retro graphics or any type of racing games."

As a fan since the first Wip3out I'm getting plenty of nostalgia from this. Apparently the developers actually listen to player suggestions and they provide meaningful updates and fixes.  I look forward to seeing how this game developes!

Also changing split screen to horizontal would be great as i rather want to see what's in fron of me, rather than what's around.Also, in split screen, if one player have canon selected, other can shot it by pressing fire (You can fire weapon of oponent!)"
,Recommended,473770,29767157,Posted: 7 February,all,The Maldonator,"This game is still under development, but from what I've seen, it's turning out rather well.I'm a pretty big fan of the WipEout series, so I was very unhappy with the decision to close Studio Liverpool, thus killing off the WipEout franchise.I have been wishing for a true successor to WipEout 2048, so I gave this game a go. Basically, if you have played any of the early WipEout games, you should feel at home. There is even a decent modding community here; the workshop even has actual ships from the WipEout series!I certainly hope that we will see custom track support as well. Who knows, maybe we'll see Vostok Reef, Moa Therma or even Odessa Keys making their debut in this game.Overall, if you're a fan of WipEout, this is a must see. Even if you've never heard of WipEout before, I do recommend giving this a go. Be warned, however, that several elements of this game are still being developed. This is not a finished product right now. I've only really started playing it, but I expect to play it more as it gets developed.I know some players might not care about WipEout (which I understand), but still, I really do hope that this ends up being the WipEout game we've been waiting for. Unless, of course, a certain studio returns...PS. Use a controller if you can"

,Recommended,473770,29943698,Posted: 15 February,all,`rotane,"In short: a free wipEout clone.Pros:Looks and feels like wipEout 2097.A ton of tracks and ships.Easy to get in, hard to master.Runs perfectly smooth at 60 fps.Fast loading times.Did i mention it's free?Cons:Graphics look dated (but this might be a deliberate design choice).Menus needseriouswork, especially when navigating with a controller. (Example: There is no simple “press B to go back”, instead, one has to chose the “back” item and select it with A. Cumbersome.)It doesn't come close to the awesome graphics design work of The Designers Republic of the original wipEout (title font, racing team logos, weapon icons, menu system, etc.).(Version 0.6.3 reviewed.)"

76561198047364141,Recommended,473770,29903025,Posted: 13 February,all,5el-9,"NOTE - My review for this game is curently outdated as a lot has changed this I last updated this. I'll update my review soon to reflect the current state of the game. Old review below till then (Dated 14 Feb).------------------------------------------------------------InShort : Intense heart-stopping and immensely rewarding gameplay....if you're willing to put up with possibly the worst UI design I've ever seen on anything.  Highly recommended.I'd recommend anyone seeking a thrill to give this a shot. The kick you can get out of this game is insane, feels like riding an extreme roller-coaster the entire time. And there's a lotta content out there to keep you occupied for a while. Also, did I mention there's workshop support for some rather sick community content with custom ships n' tracks? Sweet!All I'd request from you when if you try it is a little bit of patience with the game's other minor annoyances. For one, the UI is downright pathethic. Doesn't respond to clicks half the time, and has W mapped to select and LShift mapped to back in the Menu. I mean, only a sadist would come with crap like that. And even the default control scheme is counter-intuitive (on keyboard atleast). But once you do get past those small niggles, my, you could sink hours into this one wiithout even realizing it. Just get used to it, and it'll be nothing less than an edge-of-your-seat joyride after that. Good work, devs!Updates -1. I see some negative reviews complaining about the pod control feeling 'off'. There's a chance you may be right, but I'd suggest you try remapping the controls to my control scheme, as I feel that the poor defaults may be the real reason than the game itself. I'd request you to give it a shot, as there's truly a gem hidden underneath to b found here :)Thrust - UPTurning - LEFT and RIGHTPitch - W and SAir Brakes - A and DBoost - LShiftUse Powerup - SpaceDrop Powerup - QAbove controls are inspired by the defaults of one of my favourite indie titles called Distance. I think this scheme works great for high-speed stunt-boost-p'up fueled racers like this one.2. There're some odd technical hitches in a couple of areas here and there that tends to break the flow, but not enough to put me off game. I noticed random half-second long freezes occuring mid-race that really hurts at times. A bit of playin' has made zero in on two of the situations that trigger thisi) Change in Music.ii) Activating Autopilot.I'll update once this is fixed.3. Sounds - The game has great music and environment sounds. The announcer, especially, sounds awesome. But the pod sounds seem to lack that 'whirr and rumble' that I wanted to hear from it. Not really a big deal, but I thought I should put it out there.Thanks for reading,Sel."

The only complaint I have is that the default control system uses ""X"" as the cancel button instead of the standard ""B"" so that's annoying and weird. The game is great though.

,Recommended,473770,30047004,Posted: 19 February,all,D2Disciple,"It's Wipeout.Specifically, Wipeout 3 (my favorite of the series), but it takes some features from Wipeout HD, such as the Zone (""Survival"") mode and the singleplayer campaign organization. To call BallisticNG a clone would be understatement - it's virtually a carbon copy.This is not a bad thing. At all. It's a load of fun, and it's worth a heck of a lot more than it's asking price of zero. nada. zip. zilch.I'll even go so far as to say the handling model is ridiculously refined, to the point that it feels better than all of the Wipeouts prior to HD. Playing on the Xbox One controller is an absolute pleasure. The AI isn't exactly brilliant, but it far surpasses the PS1 games' habit of spreading them across the track and basically serving as mobile checkpoints for you to overtake. The graphics are legit too - do yourself a favor and crank that resolution down to 720x480. It's the only right way to play this game. There's a lot of content to explore too - I can't wait to look at what the modding community has come up with, accessible right from the main menu.If I'm (really, really) nitpicking, I'm not sure the design language quite matches up to the Wipeout franchise. The tracks look kind of sparse, whereas Wipeout 3 had little details like doves flitting away from docked yachts as you passed, pink cherry blossom petals floating gently to the ground, fireworks bursting on the horizon between skyscrapers, and vapor trails reflecting off the wet track in the rainfall. Some of the tracks lack any real defining environmental details other than fairly generic trackside objects. A few of the tracks remain unfinished, but I look forward to seeing what's done with them - perhaps, in time, these and the existing tracks will be updated to be more visually exciting.But it's a free game that literally could be a legitimate entry in the Wipeout canon, so who am I to look this gift zero-grav racer in the mouth? I'ma shut up and race.EDIT: I made a comment previously that the track ""Luna"" felt unfinished, and in fact, it is. I have edited the review to reflect this."
