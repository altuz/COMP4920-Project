As it is, The Nest is a cool concept that's fun for about 10 minutes, but like a lot of these VR games, is a one trick pony. The sniping is fun, the zooming in is cool, playing at night is awesome, but you see all of it and do all of it before you can even really get into it. I know the game is Early Access. I hope the devs keep working on it and add new locations and a campaign and everything we could ever want. But a score should not be based on hopes and dreams. I will definitely keep checking in on this every time there's an update, eager to give that thumbs up."

It looked alright at the time (it's fairly aliased, and the contrast is harsh), but it has not aged well. Maybe it received too much press at the time. Now that I've complained about how half the Unreal Engine VR games look like crap, I will note that the game remains the very simple demo it was when I bought it. One sniper nest, facing one direction, facing the same environment, shooting the same robots, with the same (singular) weapon, in either morning or night configuration. The developer or the potential customer reading this can do better.I believe they added Christmas lights during a holiday update, that's positive.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849200057"

If you're used to shooting real rifles (I am) you'll find the position of the scope on the gun, while accurate to an RL gun, makes it very difficult to see through in the vive because you'll be looking at the edge of the lens, thus making everything blurry. This leaves you with two options: 1) move your head. 2) move your body. Both throw off years of muscle memory. :( Putting in a method to move the scope to the right or left of center would fix this problem...i'd rather my gun look weird and work/feel right, than my gun look right and work weird.2. The AI is...really simple. As long as you kill your target with the first shot, none of the other enemies will notice you. ""Cool! A reward for precision!"" Yea...but...they don't react *at all*. They don't seek cover, they don't dip and dodge, they don't try to find you. Nothing. They just wander around like braindead robots.3. The hardest difficult just puts armor plates you have to shoot off on, so that it takes two headshots to kill. Sure, I have to dodge a shot everytime i try to kill something, but...that feels like a downgrade. Its just irritating that the way they make it harder is to make it take two headshots. I'd rather it be harder by the AI having better reflexes, or actively trying to find me, requiring me to be sneaky."

This game offers a player the chance to be active in the game without being OVERLY active. I have some VR games that get me running around and sweating within the first minutes of game play. The developers of this game came up with a cool concept to take advantage of the full space that the Vive sensors offer by creating the nest the sniper stands in. The only thing that I could ask for would be extended game play. Gameplay for me looses my attention after maybe four plays through the game. I would like to see the sniper continually advance from one nest to another after the robots are destroyed at the current nest. Maybe the sniper could have a cool holographic map that shows nests that unlock after a particular nest is destroyed. There could be a myriad of goals for the sniper to accomplish. He could be making his way out of an area to maybe a base station where the robots are landing. He could snipe enemy robot ships before they land. Shoot, he could even steal a ship and make his way into the mother ship that invades earth. He could then snipe his way around, take out the facility that is creating the robots. The robots could be bigger and meaner with each advance. Just my thoughts, I am sure there is going to be more levels to come. I guess I just have to be patient."

Sniping from one spot with a bit of dodging, it's not stellar action. Nice visuals conceal a game that gets dull quickly after a 10 minute session, the rather short playtimes clocked up by other reviewers indicates this too.More critical by far is the developer has failed to deliver the full game. It's over 6 months and counting since the last update, which is the same time past it's full release date. Cash grab and run? You decide!In summary....

You can get my full thoughts on the game from myfirst impressions video.In the current build of the game, there seems to be an issue with firing shots on every trigger-press. If I pull the trigger down slightly to ready a shot, and then click the trigger to fire the shot, sometimes nothing will happen. This can really screw you up in a game of this nature and I assume it will be fixed soon.Note that my playtime isn't indicative of how much time I've actually spent playing since this isn't my primary account for enjoying my games."

While a little low on content right now, I appreciate the developers releasing this early so we can get to experience it and provide feedback, and the price is very reasonable right now. The best aspect of this game is how authentic the sniper scope feels compared to a real zoom lens. The zoom works well, although I had a little trouble getting the fine grained adjustment part working well. I have a 970 and was worried about the graphics as it recommends a 1070 but I cranked them up to the max and it ran fine (I do have a beefy CPU however). Ths game is definitely fun and there is nothing else quite like it, as sniping with a highly accurate Vive controller makes a huge difference to the authenticity.What I'd like to see in future - more variation in the robots. Also, have them snipe you straight away upon pulling the trigger, dodging their bullets is a little too easy, although I had a hard time on intermediate so maybe I should shut up. It would also be neat if you could have several vantage points to snipe from, either different windows or openings within the same 'nest' or the ability to teleport to different nests on the same map. Some of these could offer a better sniping position but leave you more exposed, adding a risk/reward element. Also a nest where you pop out from the side in addition to the window you have adds more tension. Finally, being able to snipe parts of the environment to cause environmental kills would be cool."

Get on your knees and be prepared to duck. Alternative way to play is standing and retreat behind the wall.  Can't wait to see this develop and have more windows and locations.Few negatives are you can get too close to the wall / the wrong side of the wall and colision detection lets you take incoming fire. Is it a bug?   And do the robots really only notice your fire when you miss... not that their buddy just had his head blown off 3 foot away ;) It would be more realistic to have reinforcements arrive and start returning fire instead of a set number to take out at the start which remain oblivious unless you fire a round into the dirt. Presumably it would also lighten the CPU/Gpu load to allow cycles to be used in other ways. A mode with an AI spotter would be nice that could be replaced with a real buddy in 2 player ""Shiny...

It has really nice graphics, a real feeling of being up in that sniper nest and having to dodge the gun blasts coming back the other way by leaning back into cover. Easy to pick up and play, so good for beginners too.The zoom is a bit fiddly at first, but within a few minutes becomes second nature to zoom out and scout the area, then zoom in for the kill.Some of the negative reviews talk about the dumb AI - you can shoot an enemy dead and the others standing nearby don't react at all - they only get a bead on you when you miss - which I suppose is a flaw compared to 'reality', but it doesn't detract from the experience for me - it's like a reward for accuracy. Once they have you in their sights it's a real challenge to get the buggers, they pin you down - especially if you've got more than one sniping back!I would only like to see 3 things to improve on this game - most importantly some new envionrments - there is still currently only one 'wild west' type town setting which gets a bit tired, though you can select day ot night which changes the game a little. Secondly, I can't help wishing the enemy had some variety. All the robots are of one type though you can change the difficulty to set how resiliant to direct hits and headshots they are. Finally, I can't help feeling that the game would be even more atmospheric if the enemy were people in stead of robots. I guess they would have to give it a higher certifiate if the violence was people-orientated (i.e. blood rather than sparks!) but I do think it would make the game more absorbing.Worth the money, especially if more content eventually gets added."

The angle of the controller required to aim is very uncomfortable, I had very sore wrists after 0.6 hours. When I first loaded it up my viewpoint was outside of the main menu, I had to restart it in order to be able to play. The scope's zoom appears to depend on the distance to what it is currently aiming at, so if zooming at an enemy ""too much"" it would zoom out automatically. This might seem like an advantage but in fact just makes it much harder to aim, as the scope zooms in and out wildly as you try to aim at your target. It is very hard to focus your eyes on objects close to you in VR (much like in real life, but more so). The notion of bringing a scope up to your eyes to aim in VR is an appealing one, but falls down fundamentally at the fact that putting the scope by your eyes is horrendously blurry - on top of which the view down the scope appears to be low resolution/pixellated."

It is easy to pick up on and it is not chaotic like a lot of the other arcade types  and it has difficulty settings for the hardcore folk. Certain modes are not active yet but it is still worth $8.99. Buy it asap and support VR development. I'll have a video on my YouTube page shortly at this link if you want to check it out:https://youtu.be/Lk_cRc-TDGsTurn the volume up on the video if you can't hear me. Sometimes it is low because of the loudness of SteamVR and limitations of Windows although I did turn the game volume down.This is more than a proof of concept in my opinion. It has more than one level and it is highly optimized so that right there is a step ahead of a lot of EA games and it actually looks good for a VR game. Please rate it by what is there not by what isn't. The devs are and will be working on this title regularly I am sure. They also have The Wake as well but after all the negative reviews this got I hope they don't change their minds on bringing that to us EA as well. We asked for them so we can give input on them. Plus you get the game now for 8.99. A steal. The other EA games ask much more than this one usually and they don't usually run well at first. This is my outlook and yes I will defend this one because I like it. It doesn't hurt my eyes to play. :-)

In The Nest the constraints are handled very well - you are inside a sniper's turret and the targets are robots stationed around a ruined building site. As you hold the rifle up to your face, you see the scope close up allowing you to get a feeling that you are really sniping. Knocking off a robots head with a good kill shot as he turns around is a curiosuly satisfying feeling. I'm aware it's early access, and i'm excited to see what's next.The scope is a great concept - as you bring it up to your face the rendering can be optimized around the sights. I think the rendering could do with some tweaks - at times even the scope view gets curiously fuzzy. However, it's a great concept. I'd also like to be able to adjust the location of the wall within the chaperone bounds - at the moment i lose tracking on the controller sometimes as it's quite close to my wall.Recommended though - it's games like this that make the Vive worth having."

I checked, I wasn't outside of my play area bounds but this was a bit... broken at the time. Outside of that, aiming was nice, firing seemed to not always register the trigger. Not sure if this was to simulate reloading or what, but if it is supposed to simulate that an animation or at least a sound would be nice.
