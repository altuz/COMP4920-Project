,Recommended,473920,30362118,Posted: 6 March,all,Subliminal Smile,"A really enjoyable game, from start to finish. Part visual novel, part time management, with some gardening and a dash of cooking for good measure. It features a cute artstyle and unique design to it, but is also wonderfully written in terms of character, dialogue and overall storyline. This game tackles a heavy subject (the death of a friend) with a lighthearted but honest nature.  Even when ghosts are introduced into the mix, it doesn't feel silly or out of place. Everything just fits together from beginning to end quite nicely in a linear and satisfying way. It also has replay value, since the game is a bit more challenging (with more achievements along the way) if you want to play it again. I would love to see more games from this developer in the future."

I think I need to re-do some things and try new angles in my next gameplay.+ Cooking, gardening, exploring... fun times!+ achivements!for £3.99, this game gives you at least two hours of regular gameplay, and hours after that with the new game + mode. (I have just begun that.)--------------Cons - ?I didn't care for the controls, but honestly, this game was made with RPG Maker, and I doubt most people would even notice that at first glance. That's how excellent this game is.The controls are tricky at first (like press S to open window, A and F to switch stuff, etc.,) But you really do get used to it. You have like 7 days and nights to understand the controls, and it's not rushed at all, you have an energy bar that's with actions, and if you don't perform any actions, you wont get tired, you can literally do what you want."

When I finished it, I thought to myself, “I may have just played the winner.”Several weeks and seven other judges later, that prediction was accurate.This enchanting adventure game follows the title character as she gets roped into house-sitting for a friend of her mother. Corinne quickly gets more than she bargained for when it’s revealed the house is haunted by numerous ghosts. These aren’t scary ghosts, just confused people trying to make sense of their new reality. The player interacts with them on a daily basis while growing and selling flowers to earn money and purchase food so the spirits can have their breakfast.The game is filled with stunning custom artwork, but don’t assume that it only won because it’s so pretty. This game has wonderful story and characterization and the adventure gameplay is simple but fun. It embodies a theme of “growth” in two ways – the literal growing of flowers and fully realized character growth for most of the cast.Seeing it on Steam is a proud moment and I look forward to playing the updated version. At the current price, you can't go wrong! Check it out!"

The graphics are cute and the story gave me the warm fuzzies. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to beat the first time around and the new game+ supposedly has extra scenes, so it's also a pretty good value time-wise besides being a good overall experience.My one critisism is that the controls feel a little clunky. It's not a game-breaking flaw, but it felt a little weird at first."

From the story to the characters to the gameplay, I love it all.  And I adore the art style!  The controls threw me off at first, but I grew accustomed to them really quickly.I love this game and definitely recommend it."
,Recommended,473920,29013372,Posted: 4 January,all,Kat Tales,"If you have a couple hours to kill and want a charming, heartwarming game I highly recommend you check out Corinne Cross's Dead & Breakfast.This game is a story told through simple tasks that take place over the span of a week. You water plants, collect mail, learn cooking recipes, and talk to ghosts in a pretty watercolor-esque landscape.If you play your cards right you’ll be rewarded with a delightfully bittersweet ending. Make sure to give New Game+ mode a shot where you can meet new characters."
,Recommended,473920,25456826,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,SCarterE,"Short and not difficult gameplaywise.  The only real gameplay elements are some basic logistical stuff and hitting a key while a bar fills up, plus some slight exploration elements.  It's like a Humongous game for adults, only good.  And it's all the better for it.  The art is simple and expressive, with a handrawn sort of aesthethic that's not gimmicky at all.  The writing deserves a special mention.  It's not melodramatic, it's only a little maudlin, and, most importantly, the game never tells you how you're supposed to feel.  Keeping this tone and this quality consistent for a longer game would be difficult, so I'm glad it's the length it is.  This is a straigtforward and intelligent game about dealing with death and grief.  I hope Corinne keeps her scarf in future appearances."

Great art. Great atmosphere. Great story. Fantastic characters. Fun time management activities. Extra scenes in the New Game+ mode.

The story is this: Corinne Cross is watching over the inn of a bed & breakfast after a death of her friend where she'll be staying for a week. Simple, huh? But when she begins to see the spirits of the dead, roaming around then its up to Corinne to... Well, take care of them. Its hard for me to say, but its kind of interesting where, as the player, you can choose if you can help the spirits move on base on your actions. The simplicity of the controls and artwork really gives character to the environment and the people that you interact with. Because as the game as beautifully demonstracted, make every day count and live life to the fullest whether in this world or the next."

The story is simple and cute and it only takes a few hours to play through it.-Visually pleasing-Easy to understand objective as they are pretty clearly laid out.-Allows you to walk faster... yes, this is THAT imporant. Nothing annoys me more thn a game that forces me to move slowly.-I enjoyed that they threw in ""amount of energy"" and money management, it makes you think more carefully about what you do.-For the price it's totally worth it...cons:-Glitchy ♥♥♥♥ing achievments... I beat this entire game with nothing to show for it even though I should have gotten close to all of them except the""10 flower pot""achievment. This, was very upsetting for me as someone who enjoys unlocking achiemvents to show for their hard work... Achivmenets validate all the time I waste gaming lol. This was upsetting enough to where I probably wont do the harder mode play through.-The controls kinda suck and you cannot change them around to fit what works for you. I have a gaming laptop and was physically uncomfortable for a lot of it. BUT, after a while i did adjust/just got used to it.-If you press f12 the FREAKING STEAM SCREENSHOT BUTTON FOR ALL GAMES, it exits the game without asking first and without saving. This, was, infurriating... As I am also someone who likes to remember games by taking screenshots of the most memorable moments."

I had a huge grin on my face when I was playing the game the whole time. The characters are all simply adorable or likeable in their own ways and there is cute humor throughout the game. Its had some cute messages and fun and easy mini games. I was able to finish with the best ending and all the objectives on the first go. The save point is easy to find and you can do a small bit of cooking and gardening in the game.The player runs on energy and once you deplet it there is no way for her to get more unless she sleeps and starts the next day/night. Dont worry though if she runs out of energy she doesnt collapse or anything she just cant cook or garden. Walking or running desnt use energy. You have two cycles in the game where you are awake in the morning and can go to the florist, hospital, or groccer and then the night comes where you can see the ghosts and interact with them.For details on the art, the style is amazingly cute for an rpg game and its not pixelated or anything. she can visably walk around. The only ganky part is thats there will be an oject in the background and forground of the character, that you can interact wth and the only way you can interact with them is by using the back key on your keyboard to look behind you or the foward key to look in front of you. Other then that the game uses the left and right key to move around.The ending is a bit sad if you choose the correct answer to finish the game but once you finish the game you can unlock a hard mode of the game where you can go though the whole game again from start to finish but everything is harder to do and takes more engery to do it etc.Overall the game is simple and adorable and well worth the money. Th developer did a fantastic job with the game. I dont believe there are going to be any updates or add ons to the game so what you see is what you get but I was happy with what i recieved from the game and the art style was what really sold the game for me. Simple adorable and unique! The game was so lovable that it was one of those games that i really wished I was inside the game to experience the story first hand. Good game to simple spend a few hours with and to brighten your day!"

I wish the story was a little deeper but Im still happy with what I got. I hope there will be sequels in the future that might be a little deeper and have a little more exploration in them. I feel that a game about a B&B for the dead could have been a little darker at times, and I would have liked a little more insite to the ghosts."

The storyline's complexity made me feel like the game's potential was not yet reached. It was just way too easy. I felt absolutely no fear of making a wrong decision & found myself wanting to do so much more than the game allowed.  I hope the creator of this game is working on something similar that has more locations to visit, more activities to do, more adventures to go on, more in-depth puzzles to solve, & more items to interact with & use inside the house.Having said that, I want to make sure that no one interprets my review as negative. The reason I wanted so much more from this game was actually because I liked it so very much. I played through from start to finish & enjoyed every moment of it immensely. This game was a really original, interesting, creative, & emotionally charged rpg, puzzle, visual novel, adventure game with tiny bits of resource management & tycoon-like elements to make it incredably addictive & surprisingly refreshing to someone with my genre prefernces.

But after playing it, I've realized this game really stands in a league of its own.  Anyone can tell you that it's precious and charming - I mean, just look at it!  But it actually takes a little bit of strategy, and I couldn't even find all the recipes or get every character's best ending on the first go.  And speaking of the characters, they are all written so well and so human that I was in tears by the end of the game because my heart was so full for each of them.
