,Recommended,473970,25066740,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,Soap MacTavish,"Zombie City Defense 2Well, it's fun. Short and sweet, but gets the point across. I'll go further into detail on each element that I think makes up this game. But, for those who don't like to read long-ish reviews,I do recommendthis game.So, meat and potatoes...GameplayIt's somewhat of a different RTS, where you don't focus so much on the economy or base building, but more on the combat and strategy. Oh, but there is a bit of base building, and an economy to worry about. So, the economy. There will be building scattered around the map, most of them being inside the walls that make your base, that produce resources when you have a unit garrisoned inside it. Farms for food, factories for metal, apartments and bunkers for people, and labs/hospitals for medicine. Food is used to maintain your armies, metal for building, medicine for healing, and people to initally buy the unit. All of these resources are infinite, except for people. That has a limit built into each map, and makes it a touch more challenging to manage your armies. It's a good thing, though, as you can't just spam one unit and ""zerg"" the map.Base building in this game is not placing buildings, but rather doing slight upgrades to buildings that already exist. Units can build fortifications inside their garrisons, or you can expand the buildings to add more room. Fortifying adds alot of defense to the units inside, while expanding allows you to fit one more unit inside, but without the extra defense that comes with fortifications.Combat is fairly straight forward, each unit will have a red circle around it, when selected, that shows it's range. Units automatically fire upon any zombie in range, and so far, seem to always target the closest zombie. You can make them attack a different zombie if you want them too, and attacking a building requires you to (on kb and mouse) to hold down the right mouse button, or use a couple unit's abilities. Almost all commands are done with the right mouse button, click for move/attack, hold click to attack something that is non-hostile. Units can be levelled up, to a max of 5, which increases their overall stats. I'm not going to go into too much detail on the different units available, but I will say that you would do well to experiment on each mission to find the right set-up. You're limited on what you have access to build via ""cards"" that require TP (gained when completing a mission/objectives and killing zombs) to unlock. Each card has a command cost, and you're limited on how much ""command"" you have. So choose wisely.GraphicsNice, and different. It's like looking through a drone feed. No photo-realism here, just blue terrain and buildings, red icons for zombies, red building when occupied by zombz. Basically red is bad, blue is good. The interface is ok, and could use some tweaking, i.e, not having the starburst pattern lines all around, makes it look cluttered to me. Your view angle is directly tied to your zoom level, which I personally don't like. When zoomed in all the way, you're essentially looking down the road, and when zoomed all the way out, it's straight bird's eye view. I'd prefer to be able to orient the camera a full 360 degrees at all zoom levels.ReplayabilityNot really existent. I mean, you can replay missions to get more TP, adjust strategies and test new units, but once you have completed all three difficulties for each mission, there's not really anything else to do.VerdictIt's a good game, great for killing a bit of time. It has a decent amount of depth without being overwhelming, and if you like strategy, but want something a bit faster paced than say, Hearts of Iron, then this one's for you. Good for pick up and play, can start it up, do a couple missions, and walk away. You can also marathon longer sessions with ""Infinite"" mode, see how long you can last!I wholeheartedly recommend this game, it's cheap, and fun. Like video games should be."
,Not Recommended,473970,33000223,Posted: 29 June,all,FicusCat,"Too many flaws making the game not enjoyable for me.It's NOT a tower defense, it's a RTS.The graphic style make it really hard to select your units, especially in a building full of zombies. That graphic style make it even harder to see if your troops are firing on something when it's raining or snowing ( yeah, small white dots in the middle of a bunch of white rain/snow dots aren't that noticeable ).The range and line of sight mechanic is confusing. Even on the tallest tower you can't shoot most things. A small house can block your whole line of sight which is problematic when all the maps are really cluttered. Yes you can destroy some of these obstacles. IF you don't care about scavenging these obstacles and can spare to create one of the few means to destroy houses. And even when everything is destroyed your line of sight isn't always cleared.The weather could be a nice touch. If the malus weren't so huge and always against you. Night fights screw your range, same for fog, rain or snow. But you always fight with that crap weather! More than half your playtime you will play with crippled troops because of the weather.The levels are poorly designed. Zombies come from everywhere with huges mixed numbers of troops. And trying to destroy a huge wave of ultrazeds with AT troops destroying my own defenses because zeds keep on piling on my factories get old really fast.A proof that the levels are ill-designed : in the first level, there is 3 defensives towers over the main attack road of the zombies. Even with long ranged troop the line of sight isn't clear enough to hit the zeds more than a couple times, what is the point of these if you can't use them ON THE FIRST MISSION?The game got a "" bunch "" of troops and stuff to deal with the zeds but ... you can't use everything and everything is locked at first. And most levels require a precise set of troops to be won. So if you buy the wrong upgrade, be ready to grind the same first level for some time just to get some more TP. As for what you can bring in a level, you get 15 points at the start of each level. With these 15 points you need to choose between 15 differents infantry type ( 3pts average ); 17 differents vehicles/turrets/droids ( 2 pts average ); 9 abilities/spells ( 3 pts average ); 7 batiments upgrade ( 3 pts average ) and a list of perks/flaws.A lot of choice, right? Not really because you will never use what you want because of this 15 points limits and the level design of the missions."
76561198263427469,Not Recommended,473970,30900213,Posted: 2 April,all,Rurik,Zombie City Defense is not a ordinary TD game.This game is a mix of TD and RTS genres. You defend a base. You recruit engineers to increase resources income. There are 4 types of resources. When you have enough resources you can recruit new defensive units. Every unit can be upgraded a lot of times.You must defend the base for 15 days. Zombies arrives with higher numbers every day. So. the rules are simple. 1) Gather resources 2) Recruit units 3) Defend the base.The visual deisgn looks nice but it's getting annoying very soon. I found this minimalistics icons instead of real models for units and zombies are really unpleasant. I don't like to peer in the screen to undestand which type of zombie attack me right now.Music and sounds are good. There are voice acting also.The main reason i gave this game a negative review is that it crashed my PC 3 times for 30 minutes. I have got a Kaspersky warning when i made an 4th attempt. I wrote a message in a game group about my problem. Five days has passed. Still no response from the developer.  The last update was 5 months ago. Looks like the game is abandoned.I can't recommend this game because it crashes and developers are not willing to fix this.

It's unlike anything I've played before.The world has been devastated by a virus turning humanity into zombies.Find resources and people. Prepare your army, improve your base, fortify building, and deploy your units.Not only do you get to choose your path, you also get to choose infantry units, vehicles, special abilities and upgrade.There are varying difficulty levels to test your skills. How long will you survive? Beating really gives you that sense of accomplishment.The visuals are colorful and cool. The game itself is deeply engaging. I'm sure that most men would love to play a Zombie City Defense 2 game."
76561198014166179,Recommended,473970,25320357,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,Buffinator,"Zombie City Defense is a combination RTS and tower defense game with a minimalist drones-eye aesthetic. The concept is adapted from a cell phone game that was a bit too long winded for the platform. The PC version, however is really very challenging and fun.The game features unlockable levels that increase in difficulty and will require more refined tactics and unit choice to complete. After each level you earn points you can spend unlocking different unit types. Each mission you can spend 15 points to use activating unit cards to bring into the fight, for example you might have to choose between bringing heavy tanks with high damage and range and bringing several more generalized infantry or drones.Because unit selection is locked behind an unlock system, sometimes you will have to replay a previous level to get more TP for unlocks and it may not be obvious the first game which units will do the best on a particular mission, or you may need to save up to unlock more specialized units.Missions are meant to be replayed, with three difficulty modes offering increasing rewards and optional objectives as well as an infinite mode. The gameplay can be really dynamic and tower defense tactics of stationary defenses isn't always the best strategy. On some maps roving platoons of infantry make for an easy win while on others tanks and fast attack humvee's have an advantage.The game is under active continued development and the Dev is active on the forums and is actively fixing bugs and listening to player feedback and has said there are more levels in the works for the future. so far I'm 30 hrs in and I've unlocked 9 levels and beaten the hardcore mode on 6 of those. It's a game with a surprising amount going on where your ability to manage the economy and make good decisions on the placement and composition of your force matters."

About my only complaint is that while the campaign flows well and is fun to play, there doesn't feel like much of a 'story' to connect everything together, so much so that at the end of the 16th level, I had to look on the Steam page to see that it was the last one.  ;)   So sad, but I hope the developer makes an expansion with more levels - it's a blast to play."

Thanks to the units and the buildings that you occupy and upgrade and the looting and so on it gives it the much needed interactivity from the player.The zombie apocalypse theme fits this genre very well. You need a sort of dumb hord like opponent that tries to overwhelm you. There is no other scenario where the scavenging and looting of buildings could be added. Perhaps aliens could of have offered a bit more like using vehicles.The game does many thigns right that other great TD games also do well. Like having various difficulty levels with harder objectives to come back to later. Also the armory where you can decide what units and abilities and vehicles and upgrades to bring with you into battle and havign to unlock them.The ressource system is also great. Food Medicine Material People. I am really glad that the game does not have Ammo as a ressource. it would be realistic if units could run out of ammo but it would also be very tedious and frustrating. Perhaps in an even higher difficulty Ammo could be added.I'd really like to see a coop mode or perhaps even MP for the next game or added here as an expansion.I recommend that you check the game out and give it a try.

You need to place engineers or squads in buildings for it to operate and start producing food and other resources. You can send crew members to scavege other buildings in the city outside your camp if you need more resources. You have to survive for number of days in order to win the level.

Sure it's $10, but for $10 I expect a little bit more than what this game gave me, but not much.To save you the read, you should definitely pick this game up when it's on sale. Install this on a laptop and you'll be having fun on a flight, or even as a means of killing half an hour in time.--The art style is 'militaristic' which fits this game well. There are a small amount of gripes however, one of which being that you can be confused where to click in order to select a unit. Unit icons in this game are rather small, however dragging to select works just fine. A minor gripe but a gripe none the less.The title of the game gives you exactly what it says, but that's it. It has the story of a mobile game, and that is probably because the first game in this series is just that.

That's why I say it would be a great time killer, because you feel progress fast. That's not my preference. Thankfully there's an infinite time game mode, but it's rather futile considering enemies get increasingly harder, the 10-15 minute mark won't be seeing much more time added onto it.The game has typos but is generally fully functioning.

That's Mobile game port.I really enjoyed let's play on youtube, for cool looking graphics, but it's came out that actualy game suscks. gamplay is dull and controls are inonvenient.There are no Unit models, only icons representing units. I was really not statisfyed."

,Not Recommended,473970,30297505,Posted: 3 March,all,step_y,"Good:- Fun for a white BUT , first 4-5 missions = TD (tower defense)Bad:- Game is an RTS not as advertise, a TD. name says ""city defense""- You need to move around to capture objectives, enemy can snipe you from a mile away which means you cant just build defenses- A lot of grinding is involved- Has friendly fire. YES you can kill your own units if you arent careful- Has balancing issue (when I first played it, some missions are impossible to play even at the easiest settings). Was fixed by the developer only after a lot of complains (mission 4 or 5). Yes imagine, mission 4 or 5 is right at the beginning.- Even at the easiest setting this game is extremely hard (when I last played it). And I grinded to maxed units. This means I have grinded (kept playing mission 1), until I had maxed out everything. AND even then its extremely hard and nearly impossible."

There are some AI issues such as your rocket teams killing other friendly units while firing at zombies who are at friendly positions. Also your units will sit there and let spitter zombies kill them because they are out of their range. But overall the game is great and I recommend it to any strategy/tower defense players. A must have imo."

76561198292000009,Recommended,473970,35483215,Posted: 4 October,all,The Chessmaster,"I just got this game and I love it. One thing that really stood out for me is just how smoothly the game runs. I have a pretty low-spec computer (a Toshiba Satellite that's a couple of years old) and I had almost no lag or choppiness on default settings. It really is a lightweight game. The gameplay is great and the aesthetics are very different from  other RTSes that I've played, very minimalist in many ways, but that's not a bad thing. It actually enhances the feel of the game.The only criticisms that I would have is that the tutorial is a bit sparse on the issue of advancement. I had to kind of figure out on my own through some poking around exactly how to unlock new areas for play. I think maybe a few windows on the selection screen to help you figure out what everything is and how to unlock new areas would be useful to new players."
