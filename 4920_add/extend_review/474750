76561198241979072,Recommended,474750,24831822,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,Billy The Bastard,"Reigns is a relatively fun game. It's not without it's flaws, but it has it's moments. I think the problem is that it feels kind of repetitive, there are apparently about 1000 cards to swipe through in total. Having played for about 90 minutes, I experienced just under half of them. A lot of the cards you read will be the same card you've read several times over, and while the game's progress seemed to be moving along at a decent pace for the first 40 or so minutes, it hits a plateau around then. What I mean by this is that you end up with a checklist of goals that you're supposed to accomplish to progress the story and unlock new cards. You end up waiting for well over a hundred years in game for the corresponding card to appear, and there's little or no noticeable reward for performing the tasks to complete your goals. The other aspect of the gameplay is the resources management, which is seemingly nonsensical, but it serves it's function adequately. You need to balance your citizens, the power of the church, your treasury and your military powers to keep everybody happy. For example, your Bishop may ask to buy executive power, causing your religious and monetary spheres to rise. If any of these spheres raise too high or drop too low, your monarch will die and your heir will take over at the beginning of the next year. It's worth mentioning that you will automatically have an heir, so you can die during your first year in power with no consequences. Each new year is marked by a new event, represented by a card. You control the response to the events of the card by clicking to the left or right of the card. Sometimes, you trigger an event with a side effect like ""Money is perpetually rising on a timer which operates opposite and contrary to the rest of the game's mechanics to make life more difficult"". The game is structured in such a way, typically, that you can take as long as you'd like to decide which reaction you'd like to pick in response to each card drawn, and the timer implemented by these events makes it damn near impossible to form even a rudimentary strategy. Especially because of the way the UI is laid out, which makes it wholly unclear whether your decision will lead to increases or decreases in each sphere.Taking into consideration that this game is only $3, these things are likely forgiveable. It's got a nice art style and minimally irritating audio. It's a good time killer for a few hours, maybe more if you really enjoy the mechanics of the game. I guess I'll give it a cautious recommendation. Worth a try when it's on sale."

However, the stories and characters are interesting. The ambiance is well tuned. The art design is consistent and unique (in regards to everything else out on the market) and easy on the eyes.The combat is simplistic and aimed to work with the basic mechanics that they've attached of swiping left/right in a turn-based way. It works for the game and it does feel satisfying when you win.If you're going to play this, and I recommend that you do, play it in small bursts. Don't try and complete the story or entire dynasties in long sessions.

This essentially puts the entire game on a timer (a relatively short timer at that), and instead of taking my time, weighing my choices and enjoying the writing (which, albiet, does become repetitive before too long), I found myself in a mad hurry, trying to spend/ gain a specific resource before my king dies.While a real-time element isn't necessarily damning for any game, it absolutely clashes against the minimalist, casual presentation on offer here, hence why I wouldn't recommend Reigns."

,Recommended,474750,28682152,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,yzuniversal,"Reignsis a small, ported-from-mobile game that is nonetheless very interesting. You ""swipe"" left and right (more on that in a moment) to perform decisions which will affect your kingdom. The land is represented by three groups, the Church, the people, and the army, with the last factor being your treasury. From a pure gameplay perspective, the difficulty comes from trying to balance all four ""meters"", because both too little and too much focus put into any of them leads to a game over. This is hard at first but after a while, you simply remember what each card and each decision do, and learn to act on them instinctively.You may actually be surprised that there is a story to this game — a kind of meta-storyline that occurs in between the lives of your many monarchs. I don't want to spoil anything here but the game maneuvers very deftly between a funny and light-hearted atmosphere and something more horror-like.The atmosphere in the game, by the way, is overall really great. The soundtrack features something like a medieval monk choir, the illustrations are simple but fantastic, and even the flavor text, anachronistic as it is, somehow manages to reflect, in a humorous and irreverent way, the realities of the middle ages.The game, unfortunately, has some flaws, mostly related to the interface. The controls were clearly designed for touchscreens and just don't make as much sense in a desktop environment. Whilst they're nice when you get used to them, for all their simplicity they were surprisingly hard for me to figure out initially. The game offers very little in the way of explanation (of anything, really), so that didn't help. Also, scrolling feels sort of laggy for me.(There is also the obvious fact that the game, even with its hundreds of cards, is rather small when compared to many other, especially mainstream games. I've seen some people complain about that in other reviews. You really should be able to tell what you're getting by looking at the screenshots and the description, and the price is entirely appropriate. Also, if you aspire to find out all the secrets this game has, it will still take you many hours.)A thing that I find very interesting aboutReignsis that it is one of the few, I think, games that bridge the divide between ""casual"" and ""hardcore"" gaming. I mean, I don't believe there are many ""gamers"" who could honestly say they never played any timewaster mobile game. But still, there is a big distinction between the kind of video games one part of the population tends to find enjoyable and the kind that the other part prefers.Reignsreminds me ofPlants vs. Zombiesin that I could see it being enjoyed both by a casual gamer looking to occupy themselves waiting in a queue and by a mainstream gamer wanting some unusual storytelling."

This game is crap, it is not done to the point where it would have become truly a game. It's just a mobile gimmick to spend 20 minutes in transport, nothing more.I'm a fan of text-based gameplay, games like ""King of Dragon Pass"" & ""NEOScavenger"" (where explicit tactical process is texted to you) truly amase me, so I probably hoped for a little too much in case of this micro-strategy. ""Reigns"" borrows inspiration from ""Hot or Not"" kind of web services - a random card of a court person or an ambassador appears before you & tells something more or less relevant, you then sway your mouse to the sides & see the 2 reaction options (negative & positive generally) & roughly the possible effects they would have on the 4 main parameters which you try balancing all the time - the relative weights of 4 social castes in the society: Clergy, People, Military, Finance. If any of the 4 parameters gets to the maximum or the minimum another poor monarch will pass. Simply cool, right? Wrong.It's not fun. Balance or not, the kings go really soon (of old age for example). You are not a king, you play as some kind of a guardian angel of the monarchy - kings will die, die & die, John XVIII will succeed to the crown of Nebuchadnezzar XXXIV while you insensibly quit paying attention to their individual fates, for you have seen everything that might happen to them 200 times already during this very gameplay session, even the picturesque deaths repeat, humour vanishes. Critical situations like wars & epidemics will come & go taking the balance & your avatars with them, while you'll still be trying to accomplish some unknown conditions to get a 2 thousand years old quests done. That's the true point of the game - to get a series of story quests (you can't care less about) done through guessing right answers at some tricky situations. Then you might even get a new pack of cards, which will repeat themselves for another 2k yrs of this. A decision is made every year, kings get old quick, the gameplay even quicker so.Ask yourself for how many times are you willing to read the same paragraph of the most interesting book just to push through?

,Recommended,474750,30524948,Posted: 15 March,all,MorsArena,"It is stupid but I somehow keep coming back to this game.I picked this game up because it seemed unique and it was really cheap, which is always nice. I knew going in the gameplay would be basic and repetitive, you are only selecting practically yay or nay on people's lives over and over again. I knew that there would be no world changing graphics, just simple geometrical shapes that resembled cartoony lords, ladies, minstrels, etc. I was actually shocked by the music, it is really nice and smooth, settling quietly into the background perfectly. Usually I turn off any music and turn on my own but for a select few games and this game has the privilege of that. But for some reason, despite this game not being particularly special, I keep coming back.The main reason I keep coming back is the puzzle aspect, there are riddles littered throughout the game which I will not hint at for the sake of avoiding spoiling. As long as you do not dig around the community hub and read guides and discussions on how to solve said puzzles, you slowly start finding your way through the games. You develop an understanding of how the cards work and how to direct your king's destiny to what you want to happen, pushing yourself forward to solving the final puzzle.The downside to this game is that the repetitiveness does wear you away. The cards are almost always the same unless you get a) lucky or b) figure out ways to nudge the life towards a specific card branch. You essentially just go through the same thing over and over again until you finally succeed, sort of like Dark Souls without the sense of accomplishment after bashing your head against a stone wall until your dizzy. I would have to wonder if there is anyone who has sat down for hours and clicked away at options, though I would doubt it. That is not to say that you can not put plenty of hours into this game, I have eleven as of writing this and going rather strong, picking up thirty minutes to an hour or so when I come back to the game, and it seems to keep me coming back somehow. I expect that until I have seen everything in the game I will keep coming back because it is in my nature to not leave any puzzle unsolved.Thanks for reading,MorsArena"

It surely has a refreshing concept, some humor and a fair prize, so I'm not gonna refund it. But still it disappointed me a little.To explain my issues with this game, I have to go a little deeper into the mechanics. There are four bars in this game - indicators of church, people, army and wealth. If any of these bars drops too low or raises too high, you die.It turns out that the ""choices"" you make during the game aren't real choices at all. If you don't plan on dying in the very first year, you aren't allowed to make decisions based on roleplay or your own point of view. That's because the only thing the ""choices"" do is raising or lowering certain indicators. So the whole point of the game basically is to memorize the several scenarios and their outcome (=how they influence the indication bars) in order to keep everything steady.And while that certainly can be fun for a while (although the scenarios do repeat themselves a lot and you are basically forced to choose the same things over and over again), it's not what I had expected: a game with a real free will, real choices and real diversion in how to develop your kingdom. No moral dilemmas, nothing. At least there are two endings, but I don't really want to play through the whole thing again, because, like I already said, you are forced to do the same things over and over again."

It's like the game gives you a 4 digit lock, and gives you a picture, and the answer was 7261Because there is 7 stains, 2 cactus, 6 chicken wings and a clock on the wall.This game is very complicated and I think it should add a hint button which tells the player how to complete this challenge Like trick the devil and it should be step by step and not strait to trick the devil which hardly tells any hint. It's like asking a student who finally figured out what's 6+7 and asks him/her to calculate 3.1415926535898/9912529.Please."

It's fun, yet after a while it becomes a chore.However, it is really, really fun. I played this with some friends and we were all yelling at each other over certain choices, so that could have lengenthened the longevity of this game.You basically choose left or right, usually two choices that are yes/no or two choices that seem similar and don't really have a different outcome. I don't know. After about 2 hours you might notice every choice leads to certain things happening because you have gotten them so much, and you might try to ""spice"" it up by picking the opposite of said choice, but it will lead to immediate failure or just nothing positive happening and making you stay with your original choice from now on.However, at other times, you might pick the same choice you picked the previous times and something different will happen, which is definitely good even though it doesn't sound like it from just reading it. Then you might try to pick that choice again hoping for that uncommon outcome, not get it, and just feel awful because you lost or something stupid bad happened. I guess that's part of the game though.There will also be times in the game where you just have no chance at all. A plague will come and you have to make some of your resources plummet, followed up by another event that will do the same thing, most likely ending up dead. Then in the same manner, there is times where everything goes absolutely perfectly and you get a crazy run with a possibly locked resource (when a resource can't go down.)There's also not really any description of the stuff and it will take a while to figure out what choices will influence what (or at least how much a choice will affecta resource by how much.)Honestly, I'm making it sound negative but I do recommend this game. It's cheap, and I've gotten plenty of fun out of it so far (7.5 hours currently.) Just wish there was a bit more information given or a way to skew the luck into your favor more often, which there very well might be and I just haven't found it yet."

As the ruler of fantasical kingdom, you make binary decisions by clicking left or right. The choices effect various stats, if any get too high or low your reign ends and you start again as the subsequent ruler. While the decisions are randomly chosen from a large deck of cards (although after a few reigns I began to regularly see repeats), the game remembers certain choices and slowly tells a story across the various reigns.Each reign last only a few minutes, but it is quick to start the next one. I often found myself just wanting to see what happens next. It is intriguing. After a several hours the novelty is waning a little, and perhaps I play now to collect the numerous events, achievements and cards. So it should possibly be considered a casual game.

Ultimately though, I'd have to say it's a soft pass as the gameplay itself is rather ""blah""In essence, you rule a kingdom in some weird Tinder-style manner of swiping ""cards"" left or right.  It's kind of a stat management game? Yes, that's an intentional question mark.  You do have 4 icons across the top of the cards that represent the different factions that you must keep happy in order to be not dead. Your actions (left/right swipes) have positive or negative effects on one or multiple groups.  That's basically it. Oh, and when you do die (it happens a lot), you take over as your heir.  Not sure why you always HAVE an heir, as there were times I messed up and died within 3 years or so. But whatevs. Either way, you plod along.At first, it was fairly entertaining and when random events would pop up, I would gain a new ""card set"" that adds more events and triggers.  But after awhile (and many, many ruler's deaths) I felt as though I was recycling the exact same cards in the exact same situations and quickly grew bored.On the positive side, the minimalistic art style is nice.  And the price is about right.  But if you subscribe to the thought that each dollar = an hour of play, then I ran out at about $1.50.If nothing else, it's a good start. But I'd say pass unless you gain this in a bundle or a deep discount (as it's already inexpensive)."

You guide the monarch of a kingdom through their rule by choosing one of two options given a randomized set of story cards. It’s hard to explain, but as someone who enjoys top-down sims as well as VNs, I thought it was a good time. Each time your king dies, you progress forward in time to the next king, and you have 2,000 years of rule to try to complete the overarching story that loosely follows all your rulers. The game has a good sense of humor, oddly likable pixel graphics, and a unique setup. It was so simple, but one of those game where you look up and you’ve somehow been doing it for two hours."

I expected a choose your own adventure game based around cards with numerous possibilities and in the loosest sense I guess it is.You have some text, explaining the scenario and two options on how to handle it. There are four bars in the shape of an icon, like sword/money/food/etc, at the top which increase and/or decrease based on your choice. If one of them drops too low then it's game over.I know the game needs mechanics beyond a choice of two options but this can be very frustrating:* You're going to lose repeatedly and feel like there was nothing you could do to prevent it.* Some choices feel out of touch with their consequences, why has person/sword decreased for me declining to a princess to build a bigger castle?* Scenarios you're given seem completely random and what comes next after a choice usually has nothing to do with what you just picked* You can also lose by filling a bar too much - have a full money bar? Apparently you had a feast and choked to death, every time.* There's no story or character development* Little depth as you realize the game is nothing more than picking things to stabilize four bars.The presentation is lovely, the concept is great and I want to like the game more than I currently am.

I don't mind that this is an adaptation of a mobile game; it's easy to learn and has nice clean design.You are the king. You're several kings, really. You will die a lot (by design), and each time, you take on the role of the successor, continuing a timeline (a la Rogue Legacy). As the king, you will receive requests and advice from your court officials, and you will decide on each issue presented.Most of your decisions will affect the strength of:The ChurchThe PeopleThe ArmyThe TreasuryMost decisions are tradeoffs, but certain issues must always result in a net gain or net loss. You have to make sure that none of their meters run out, or else you will be overthrown and your reign will end, You also have to make sure that none of their metersmax out, or else you will be overthrown and your reign will end. As your kingdom grows, you can meet new characters and recruit them as advisers. Additional scenarios become available as the years (and generations) go on. Early on, you may find yourself making decisions based on your own moral judgment, and after a few hasty deaths you may learn to play the game instead.There is also a centuries-long story unfolding on the back burner. In between the dozens/scores/hundreds of petitions from your people, you must search for a way to lift a curse. Your decisions in the minor issues may affect your ability to discover a solution to this larger problem.There is replay value here, but you may exhaust it quickly. In one single playthrough, you'll hear the same requests dozens of times apiece. Granted, this is over several kings across several centuries, but it does start to get repetitive to the player. I took a few hours to play through to my first ending, and I do plan on playing it again to try for a better ending.

Each choice is alluring and wondering if you are making the right choices is always fun. There are 4 resources to manage. Religion, wellbeing of the people, military, and federal cash. If you let any of these reach bottom, or reach too high. You lose! Example. IF the people get TOO happy, they think they should overthrow you. If you run out of finances, you have no way to ward off merchants. Ect. There are lots of bonuses that last round to round (you don't start over entirely when you die, just a new king). These bonuses are fun and keep the game interesting. When you encounter new things, it adds new random cards to the deck. This game is fun as heck, and I also bought the Android version for my smartphone. Some people complain when an android/ios game gets ported to steam, but I'm honestly glad this is here! If I'm sitting somewhere with my gaming laptop, I'd rather play it on there than drain my smartphone battery. Regardless, this game is fun with either a touchscreen on your phone or on a full size gaming desktop with a 27"" monitor.

As it stands it just becomes a game of balancing the bars.Secondly the forced balance makes the game boring. Neglecting certain needs should have considerable effects on the cards drawn, not an outright ""game over"" screen.

Your decision, which is not just a yes or no, will reduce or increase one of your 4 resources. Faith, People, Army, Money. Certain desicions might please or displease several of these resources at any given time. Get one of them to either the lowest or its highest mark and yourreignis over! Every choice matters, every decision might affect a future one is some degree so you need to be careful. Appeasing the Army constanly will have detrimental effects on the People although they might be circumstances which will benefit both.The game also features sort of miniquest and a dueling mechanic. Completing the miniquests will unlock more sets of cards to play around with during your reign. There are also sort of items (and I'm using the term loosely here) which will help you or hinder you depending on said scenario. Some of them will persist even if your current king dies for some years and some might have a use further down the road.Reigns is delightfully minimalistic at a first glance, but once you get into you'll begin to understand how it excels at keeping you hooked to play some more. There are many secrets to discover within the game, there's plenty of humour and meta humour to go around and at this price it's a definite recommendation if you're looking for something different and refreshing to play.Long live the King!"

Yeah, sure, you swipe left and right to say 'yes' or 'no', but that's about where the comparison ends, IMHO.Essentially, the whole game is a series of mini decisions that affect one-or-more of your four stats.The excercise is in sort-of memorizing the outcome of the various decision choices. The game tells you before hand what stats will be affected (and gives you an idea of the magnitude), but does not tell you if it will be positive or negative.The cool thing about this, is the story progresses chronologically and often references past runs. You earn more cards in the deck by completing mini objectives.It is all very cool, but once again, the scope never really breaches mobile-status.Pros:+Cool idea that works well; it is quite entertaining as the stories build+Humor is good+Artwork is nice+Mechanic works well particularly considering controller supportCons:-While there is a good bit to do, I'd imagine that once everything is completed, there will be little reason to keep playing-Never breaches the scope of a mobile-game, IMOTotally worth three bucks.You'll definately get sucked in for at least an afternoon, I'd say."

I have to continue with the one i have no matter what which is something i dont necessarly want to do.They call your ruling family a dynasty but you dont ever feel you have one, since even if you never have childrens, and get several kings killed in quick succession, it wont affect your ""dynasty"". Youre also stuck with the names the game chooses for you. Youll have 34 roberts and 52 williams. Why doesnt it allow us to pick our own names if we want to? Id like to be Lemmiwinks the first, the second etc...Some deaths are really arbitrary and shall we say, stupid.If you have too much gold in your treasury, you lose/die.The peasants are too happy?? you lose/die (wait what?)The church loves you! they kill you and make you a martyr! (how does that even...)You agreed to all the demands of the military? they organize a coup! (for some reason)See the patern here?They force you to constantly balance powers/factions/money or face defeat but its stuff that SHOULDNT cause you to lose when its in the green, and those deaths feel both forced and illogic.Passive accumulation/decrease events ARE COMPLETELY BROKEN. They go up or down depending of a certain rate per second. That means, in a game that is about READING to make DECISIONS youll have to hurry up and blindly make choices as fast as you can, because the faction counter goes up or down WHILE YOU READ. You cant take your time to make a decision, because it will mean an instant lost! How does a system like that make ANY SENSE. It breaks the intended purpose of the game! I cant believe it.(be my guest, check it! , be under the effect of the orange mushroom with an accumulate/decrease event, the rate at which it changes per second is insanely fast)Yeah, i cant recommend it in its current state.

In my opinion, Reigns is interesting and funny, but not particularly fun to play for more than an hour.You have 4 guages in this game. Religion, Population, Militia, and Finance. A card appears and says something like:""Sir your people are sick!""You then can choose from two options and you can guess how the stat guages will be affected. This scenario is easy. You pay for medicine and your Finance guage drops and population goes up. If you do nothing, then only the population goes down.The object of the game is to keep the guages from going too low OR too high. If one stat hits zero, it's game over. If a stat hits 100%, it's game over again (For example if Militia hits 100% the army kills you and takes over).Honestly it's very fun for the first hour. After that I had my fill and decided to keep playing and get some achievements. Now I'm at 2 hours and I'm mainly seeing the same cards over and over with a new card every few turns. Some of the cards are just painful as well....like a dog asking you a question in gibberish and your response gets you a game over. I think I'd recommend this game as well if each card was treated like a word puzzle...but the random cards just add to the monotony.Cost factored into this review....I'd recommend as well. $3 for an interesting experience like this is worth it. However ignoring the cost, I'd give the game a 5/10. It excels from it's originality, but suffers from it's continued fun factor."

Fine for the price, I suppose, but still feels a little sparse, especially given that some events are harder to access than others.- Loses replay value after a while. There are (at the time of writing) ~850 cards in the game, 29 deaths, and ~40 characters and objectives. In one run - assuming you don't just play infinitely without taking an ending or resetting AND you are paying attention - you can probably see half the cards, meet almost all the characters, do 2/3s of the objectives, and get about half the deaths. Bear in mind, one run takes about two hours at a slow pace. After three, you are probably short twenty cards and have seen and done everything else. At a certain point, the immersion and humor stops carrying the game, and you are left with what amounts to resource management Tinder.Overall, I'd recommend it if you want a funny, immersive, casual experience or if you are a completionist looking for an interesting challenge.

Some conversations, however, will have no change but are fun in my opinion. There is one reoccuring thing though: Satan, whom pops up quite a few times (I've met him three times...possibly a fourth coming up soon). There are also artifacts that could hinder or aid you. There is also a ""dueling"" system that is quite fun, and a Pungeon that has some secrets. For other secrets, I suggest you get this game.

One of the major things about this game is that it felt very repetive with very little variation, occasionally you get a special senario where something interesting happens, it was cool when I met the devil, but after that it felt more like a grind to see the next event, I would be okay with this if there was a bit of variation between each king, but unfortunatly there isn't. With every king it is, ""Hey would you like to marry this lady"", ""Hey you are being attacked, would you like to make peace"", ""M'lord the people are starving, you should build a farm"", and finally ""The people have begun to rise against you and they plot to overthrow you"" to which you can only respond with ""what"" and then its ""The people raided you stronghold and have stabed you to death"", whoop-de-do, next king repeat prevous steps. Sure there are minor variables in the gameplay like the ability to hire a spy or a doctor, or maybe you get the chance to enter a dungeon and play a little fencing mini-game, but other than that it is the same dull thing, over and over. Another thing that I disliked was the indicator of how your actions affect your kingdom, it doesn't show wether it will be good or bad, so you could read a thing and then act how you think you should and then one thing you thought would go up goes down, the only thing that solves this in the game is eating a blue mushroom which tells you the results of your actions and wether they are good or bad, in my opinion this should be how it is all the time. If the developers do happen to read this then I would suggest adding more variation, add many different, unique, and special events to affect gameplay, this will keep players hooked and ready to start the next king, and the other thing is that I would suggest making the clarity that you get from the mushroom constant through out all of the kings so that I actually know what my actions will do."

Every time you die, you start playing again as the succeeding king, and this goes on ad infinitum, so far as I've played, but this never really gets to be annoying, in fact, I always felt the urge to play another 'round' of the game, if you will.The characters, albeit quite simple, are compelling, and along with the surprisingly robust world building the game preforms, makes for a kingdom you actually care about ruling properly, and in my own experience, I always wanted to get better; I wanted to be BETTER than the previous generation's king, and I wanted to do the tasks set out by the game.This is all made far easier to digest and appreciate by the game's simple and unique art styles, consisting primarily of colorful geometric shapes used in unison to form the characters and scenery of the game. It's really memorable, and I always find myself remembering the characters I've seen before BECAUSE of just how unique they look (Like ♥♥♥♥ing hell I can remember any of the names, though)I can't honestly level any criticism at the game. I guess any would-be critique of the game would come down to personal grievances with it, and that's fair, but I dont have any of my own. The games sets out to do what it does and it does that well.This game, in all its simplicity and almost utter practicality, manages to be a memorable, enjoyable title, that's worth so much more than its minute asking price. I'd highly reccomend this to anyone; It's the kind of experience you won't find elsewhere, I'd wager, and again, the game's price is definitely a positive in this regard.So uh, yeah, it's alright."

,Recommended,474750,29838811,Posted: 10 February,all,hkennyrules101,"Pros:-Casual gameplay-Easy to learn-Intriguing plot-Varied characters and events-Clever combat systemCons:-Repetitive-Combat system poorly explainedOverall:This game started out on mobile, and got ported to PC.  So as you might expect, the layout is pretty basic, the controls are easy, and it's a game that can be played in short bursts.  It's great for when you have a few minutes here or there, and the game is fairly replayable.The game relies on sliding left or right for every decision or action.  You have to juggle the power of the army, population, church, and treasury, and if any one gets too powerful or too weak, you lose.  The events are randomized, and eventually you will die, only to start again as the next king in the lineage.  It's simple and fun.There is a combat system, which also uses the left/right mechanic in a turn based minigame.  However, the game does a terrible job explaining how combat works.  It doesn't even tell you how to win.  In short, if you buy this game, look up a guide for how to do combat.  A few community members have made good ones.  Combat is not hard, but the game simply doesn't explain it.Aside from that, the only ""drawback"" is that the game is repetitive.  You just say yes or no to every decision, and after a while you start to memorize the outcomes of decisions as you see the same events over and over.  But there are enough unlockable events and things that there's always some new variation waiting.There is an overarching plot, and it's actually pretty good.  But this is the type of game you play for the gameplay.  If you don't enjoy it, the game's plot won't make you keep playing.  If you do enjoy the gameplay, then the plot is a good reason to keep going.Personally, I found it a very relaxing and easygoing game that relieved some stress.  Worth it if you want a casual, fun experience.Bottom Line:$3 is nothing, and it goes on sale occasionally for half off.  Easy recommend."

I first saw it on Jim Sterling's channel and was immediately intrigued and I personally find it to be more than worth the price, though the price that's asked feels just right.For such a simple-seeming concept, it offers a surprising amount of depth that even though I'm at just about 2 hours of game time, and have seen what I believe to be most of the cards, it's still able to surprise me just enough to want to know what can happen if I try different choices. On top of that, the overarching premise is interesting enough that I actually have been trying to trigger the events to continue it because it intrigues me so much.It's central mechanic is so simple and yet so, so effective. People say it's like Tinder but I don't know what that is (please don't kill me) but for someone who knows nothing about that, the swipe left or right for each decision is actually really well-done. Some of the decisions can even have more than just two choices so if Fallout 4's system irked you this shows how something even simpler can still offer a variety of meaningful choices.While I unfortunately don't have too much to say on the game, I full-heartedly recommend you at least try it.

Sometimes I get killed fighting skeletons in my own dungeon, sometimes I take on a mushroom trip and get exiled for being mad. I've lost limbs and I've talked to animals for advice on how to run my country.

Not to mention the times my advisor was found banging my queen and then overthrew me... Good times.Get this game so you too can experience dying, ruling, and dying again. And for 3 euros there isn't much to argue with.My only gripe is the country bonus system. Some of them turn the game timed, aka constantly draining/filling one of your meters.

The ideea seemed cool.I was excited the first hour too.But then I became aware that it's full of repetitive deaths and objectives that are on the screen for more than 500 years (in-game) and no event that can unlock them. How should I ""date a pigeon"" if no pigeon comes to me?It basically comes down to micro managing the four icons on top (church, people, army, money) while things get out of hand fast.You die if any one of them becomes full or depleted. You just get a message that something is about to happen and that's it. Your choices are ""What..."" on the left and ""What..."" on the right.It would have been nice to have some cards available to mitigate this. I understand that death is a core part of this game, but it gets boring fast.So far I am around year 1650. I'll keep playing just to see what happens when I hit 2000, but that's what's left of my curiosity for this game.And the events that trigger the so called power-ups that increase or decrease your icon points are just rubbish. All of them are there to make your reign harder, wich may be interesting, but increasing or decresing your points every real-time second?! It takes me sometimes 3-4 seconds to read a big sentence and understand it. Not to mention that english isn't my native language.

,Not Recommended,474750,25539211,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,Dravvad,"I did not get what I really expected from this game. I bought it for the cheap price and expected something very relaxing, where I'd get to make some silly decisions as king without any required thought or care. Technically, that still exists to some extent - but in reality, the game punishes you a lot more often (and I mean a lot!) than it should, and the developers seem like they were stuck between a thought-less version or planning-required version of the game. I also feel like it is definitely overrated and that the cheap price is not a reason to say it is good.To sum up the premise of the game as quickly as possible, you are a king who sits and makes binary decisions (usually just a yes/no for performing an action or doing nothing) for an indefinite period of time. As you make decisions, things may go bad for you and you die. But the game does not end if this happens. Instead, you are just reborn as the next king and continue on, over and over, until you find a way to reach some ""endings.""The game keeps four stats for you as king: religion, kingdom health, your army, and money. As you make your decisions, you'll see little dots saying which stats the choice will affect, but it won't tell you how it affects them (i.e., whether it will increase or decrease the stat). Some decisions will make it obvious whether it will harm your army, for instance, or really help the health of your people, just based on reading what you are actually deciding upon. However, not all decisions are exactly straightforward and can lead to unexpected changes in your stats.Why does this matter? The game only allows a very small amount of each stat for you to have, and it sets a maximum boundary as well as minimum boundary for the stat. What this means is that if any of the four stats hit either boundary (""too much"" or ""too little""), the game will kill your king character. And let me tell you - this happens OFTEN unless you are very lucky or are scrutinizing everything forever, especially if you get surprised by a decision that triggers a large, unexpected change.To make matters worse, the game will have you stumble upon ""curses,"" some of which should actually be good things but are not, due to the game's mechanics. Certain event cards trigger a curse, which means from that point forward, usually until you die, one of your four stats will either increase or decrease at a constant rate as time goes on. This basically means that you must now make faster decisions than before in order to offset the new stat change, and also means that you likely want to avoid any decisions that will push that stat in the same direction as the curse. The maximum boundary death trigger is completely silly, especially because of things like curses - why is increasing money for the kingdom bad, for instance?Now, some of the events that the game randomly draws for you are funny or interesting to read over; but unless you hit specific paths in your decisions, you will end up redrawing the same events over and over, and things get somewhat boring quickly. Even as I started getting newer events, I got bored with the ""game"" pretty easily because it was simultaneously trying to be so simple and thoughtless but then required planning.At some point, after 45 minutes or so, I decided to give the game a test. The test was to see how fast I could meet all of the characters and go through all of the events and so on, without giving into planning the stat changes much. It turned out that the random chance of the game allowed me to trigger many characters, many king deaths, and many general events without caring at all. I would just leave the mouse on one side of the cards and keep clicking over and over, and I ended up ""unlocking"" more than half of the cards in just a handful of minutes. So the game really is a paradox.I cannot recommend this simply because the developers did not seem to know what kind of game they wanted. If they wanted it to just be silly and fun with crazy decisions, they should have removed the actual stats management and just focused more on drawing scenarios based on what you do as the king, making more of a relaxing, laidback decision simulator. If they wanted to make it more difficult with some actual planning, then this format was not the right choice at all."

Taking a ""tinder-like"" yes or no approach to problem solving initially seems like a negative quality, but is in fact the greatest strength of Reigns. Reigns challenges you to memorize, hypothesize, and predict in ways many games don't. On top of that, there is a brilliant sense of humor and plenty of well-written dialogue which pull everything together. And at $2.99, why not give it a try."

I've chuckled a number of times at the gruesome deaths I've suffered from poor choices, or just random♥♥♥♥♥♥happening. Plus I appreciate the underlying satanic story line that is slowly unfolding with each new deck of cards you unlock.Only gripe is that achievements are not unlocking at the time of writing this review. I normally do factor it in considering I am an achievement hunter since the Xbox 360 entered my life oh so many years ago. Here, however, I just can't. Reigns is such a simple and fun casual gaming experience that I'm not upset nothing is unlocking. Hopefully I won't have to start from scratch if/when the update fixes this though.

I liked the game alot but then i started getting better at it and i ended up getting all 4 almost at their max. The problem with that is i lose if i do to good. Lets say you have 2 stats high one medium and one low. The game gives you 2 options. The first is raise the one you have almost max in or lose one you have low stats in. Now you have 2 options A: Lose the game by raising that stat to high. Or B: Lose the game by the stat falling. That mechanic annoys me and makes it hard to continue one life. Another amazing option the game can give you is it asks you a question on if you want to solve the peasants overpopulating if you say yes your left with an option to either lose most of your stats if you say no. Which is pretty bad so the other option must be better right? Or for 4 generations you can gain 1 stat raising each second which will kill you. And one dropping each second. That effect lasts for how many reigns untill you have the option to go back (Which doesn't happen often). You will almost explore every single card by year 1100. Which is about half the game. It also makes you unable to play the fun parts of it unless you want to live. For example there is a duengon part that you have to fight skeletons and find treasure chests. But eveyr second all of your stats get lowered making you rush it. For 3 dollars its decent but there are games probably worth more than this.

The only reliable way to survive for more than 30 years is to have a Crusade or Silk Road and even then the game will actively undermine you by not giving you cards to spend the influx of cash fast enough before you die from eating yourself to death.It's good as a whacky procedural storytelling device, but trying to use any strategy at all is a waste of time, I got to 40 years by randomly selecting only cards on the right.

The result of your choice will effect one or more of your kingdoms 4 groups, the church, the people, the military, and the treasury. Your object is to rule as long as possible, keeping all 4 groups happy, while completing objectives.

For its price its fine, but I still would not suggest that you buy it. There are more interesting games that can be played on your phone and certainly on your computer. The premise of the game is that you are a king or several kings that try to avoid dying. There are methods in the game that help you see what the best decision will be. You are always given two different choices, some of them will improve you in some of the four areas, while others will cause them to drop.The church, people, military, and treasury must all be maintained and not drop to zero, but you cannot allow any of them to be maxed out, because if the people are too happy and satisfied and not starving, they'll kill you. If the church has recieved lots of favors from you, they'll kill you. If the treasury is full and the kingdom should be relatively secure, you choke on a bone and die. In essence, the whole game is a balancing act. Where the player has to make the best decisions in order to stay alive the longest. Morality doesn't matter. If the people gauge is near max, let them die, on the other hand, if its low, help them stay alive. Its better for you. The game has its own internal logic that doesn't reflect the logical decisions that someone in real life would make. That's fine, if a little irritating. There is no nation on Earth that wouldn't want a healthy economy and treasury, but in the game you don't want to be rich and wealthy, because chicken bones will kill you if you're too wealthy.There are some events that occur in real timr which surprised me a little. There are events that cause money to constantly tick up in value, as well as events that cause the population to tick down, these however, occur in real time rather than on a turn by turn basis, as well as the church to dissaprove of your actions while the people will not give a damn what you do. It's a little interesting. but that's my problem with the game, it's only a little interesting. From a ""best decision"" standpoint, it makes sense a lot of the time to simply sit and wait while the trade makes you nice and fat, basically encouraging stalling from the player whenever they are low on money and get that bonus which can be easily abused, it might have been better to just give the player something that gives a set bonus for a set number of turns instead.The battles show some pretty spectacularly boring gameplay. There are decisions that you make which can make you go forward, stay where you are, and move backwards. There are special moves that can be used, but only after you make certain actions, which the game tells you after certain swipes that you choose to make. It's alright, but doesn't require too much thinking, much like the other areas of the game.There also just isn't much variety to what you'll get from the NPCs. They'll sit there and tell you the same stuff over and over. You get a new advisor who is also an artist, what does that artist do? They inform you about things that another advisor you already had did. While also occasionally giving you suggestions for things that will make the people like you more and maybe the church, but the downside is that it costs money. But wait, if the church gets too big and strong because of how much you patronize the church, they'll kill you.It would have been nice or interesting if you could have the military or some other faction like the merchants be paid to bring groups like the church down for a price when it reached that point, you get other methods instead, like anytime something related to medicine and doctors comes along, people die if you side with the church, so just help the people instead.In some ways however, the predictability of the game is what stops it from being what some people would argue is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You figure out what choices are the best to make in certain situations because of how predictable it is. That's good I suppose, but it doesn't stop the fundamental problem of the game being not that particularly interesting or fun. It feels like the game could have easily had some more added to make it just a little bit more interesting.The dungeons also suck."

The decisions you make effect your kingdom in a number of ways improving or worsening the situation of 4 competing interests: the church, the people, the army and the treasury--if any get too strong or too weak you die, and are replaced by the next king.Throughout the game there are multiple story lines which develop and a bigger conflict which pervades the whole succession of monarchs. It tells an interesting story and is just plain fun to play, and also makes you think about how difficult it would be to actually rule as a king.Music and graphics work well with the game and provide a nice backdrop to the game. As you continue to play the game some aspects can get repetative, but it is also interesting to try to figure out all the different things you can do (including the inumerous ways to die).I will mentiont that there was a glitch which would sometimes hang up the game for a second, but it didn't interefere too much, and never prevented me from playing after just a moment.At $3 the price is very fair for this type of game, and if it is on sale I highly recommend. This game will probably keep you interested for about 3 hours or so, and if you are a completionist certainly much longer.I give this game 8/10, and recommend it."

You take the role of king of your kingdom. A very well-worn theme for a game. Many games of this sort were very hands on and very ""castle defense"" about the whole thing where you actually raise an army. Send them around. Have combats, manage resources etc. Castlles in the 90s is the one I remember most. I think ""Castle Defense"" has since become a term for the kingdom Simulator. But this takes that whole premise and simplifies it into an attractive and silly animated card game. You deal out cards, each card that comes up is one of your advisors. They give you a choice. YOu say yay or nay. YOu have four things that will effect: Church, people, military, and money. Once one of those hits zero you lose. I did not actually realize that was WHY I kept losing for quite awhile :). And it didn't matter. THe characters of your court are very charming. DOne in a very cool art style and each uses a distinct voice that speaks in gibberish. YOu basically see how far each king can get. And it KEEPS TRACK. You see each king on a grand timeline of kings, some are even called things. LIke if you arrange a marriage between two werewolves (persay) you are called ""the Tender"". Hmmm I just realized maybe the wolves themselves gave me that name! :O So fun and so addictive. Can pull that up whenever you need a laugh. Love the legacy feel and the achievements from Steam really add to this."

The cards are interesting and advance the story in fun ways based on your decisions. Trying to balance everything out and keep it all in the green is a fun challenge, and your choices will lead you down different paths to different ends. It's interesting to see the different failures and successes.

But old jokes get repetitive. And there is not enough depth to gameplay other that reading jokes. There must be more new cards and, maybe, some additional ropes for the player to affect the gameplay.

This game puts you in the shoes of a king as you balance the 4 powers (Church, People, Army and Economy). Make 1 power too powerful or too weak, there goes the end of your reign. Your duty is simple yet really difficult. Balancing the 4 powers through the different options the game gives you such as the Pope wanting you to build more churches or the General wanting you to make the army more powerful.Seriously though... the 4 powers are a pain to balance. Make the economy too low and nobles own everything. Make the army too weak and you get attacked by other kingdoms. Make the people unhappy and you are left with no one to rule over. Make the church too powerful and the pope decides that you'd make a great martyr (rip).10/10 Would definitely reccomend this since the game itself is fun and it's worth the price in my opinion.I got this on the 60% discount which is exactly why I'm glad I bought this game.

,Recommended,474750,24844557,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,Maeda,"(NOTE: This is a summary of my review video, which can be found below)Reigns is a simulation game in which you play as the kings of a medieval kingdom. The main game loop is centered around reading cards of texts and picking one of two choices that the character speaking to you - it could a jester, a doctor, a general, or any one of a lively cast - offers. Your decisions affect four factions, although not each factionwill be responsive to every decision you make. The game doesn't tell you whether one particular choice willhave a positive or negative consequence on your relationship with that faction. This, in turn, yields to an element of uncertainity which makes the experience both enjoyable and replayable. In a market full of simulation games trying to take themselves super seriously, Reigns is a breath of fresh air. While the gameplay might be simple and the atmosphere almost comical at times, the choices you make have an immediate impact both within your reign and across your lineage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgRl0rZTuE"

I immediately plugged in my controller, sat back and put my feet up. I enjoyed every single part of it.The game is about you playing as a set of kings going from one to another after each different one dies. Each decision you make affects your standing with the Church, your Population, your Treasury and your Army size. If you make a set of bad choices, you will die. The game is extremely fun and often makes you think about certain decisions for some amounts of time. There are also mini objectives within the game that unlock more and more events.

You have different cards (or different skenarios) with each of them having a two choice and it will have positives/negative consequences (or in some caes, nothing) for your kingdom. Unfortunately it gets boring pretty fast, but it's not the only reason.Your king dies if one of your four elements/resources get depleted, but also having too much stuff leads to the same result. I would understand the religion and military, but really....having the people meter filled up will lead to anarchy and having too much money will make your king unintentionally kill himself for eating too much expensive food.When time passes, you'll might get a different bonuses that will give you free stuff automaticlly (in real-time btw), but you can also get a negative trait that does the opposite. The problem is that you have to make your choices really fast and you probably won't have the time to read the cards and you WILL make a bad decision eventually. But what about the positives traits/buffs....well here's the thing, as I said earlier, having too much stuff will lead your king to his death, so it's actually a bad thing to haveKolumbus knock-off finding a new world (increases your military and money when time passes in real-time even if you haven't made any choice yet) or making a deal with eastern factions with caravans moving in the silk-road (increases your money etc...).When you are scared for making too much money, increasing your army strength or making your people's well being rather flawlessly, then there is definitely something wrong with the game.If some of these issues are fixed, maybe I would enjoy it more, but it feels more like a time consumer than an actual game, but it seems that Reigns is a mobile game and I might recommend this game for a mobile. It has a big layout and a really simple game mechanic, which is underwhelming for a PC and that's why it should stay as a mobile game in my opinion. In short, the game is not broken or awful, but not that enjoyable.If you want a good mobile-originated game, download Fallout Shelter, because atleast that game is actually fun, even when playing with the PC. However, if you are really interested in a simple mobile game for PC and don't think that the issues I mentioned are that bad, I suggest you give it a go, but i'll give this game, a non-recommended status and requested a refund for my game. (cheap or not, I like to save my money, sorry)P.S: Reigns is not a bad game by any means for many people (92% approval rate with 500 reviews at the time writing this), but for me, I didn't have much fun with it after an hour and some gameplay elements made me stressed. I understand if you strongly disagree with my opinion and that's fine, but clearly this game is not meant for me."

Get ready to restart...a lot.-Progression in the story line is also determined by the random chance of choices. That means if you don't get the choice you need to progress/die/get overthrown while some effects are in temporary effect(And are critical to progression), you are basically stuck with no way to recover-VERY low replay value due to the limited choices/cards.All in all, it is not recommended for one's time, and IMHO it was a waste of cash with no sales on, but if you really want to, try it, but keep an open mind.GL ~ Arkenthedragon"

The choices you make will eventually lead to your current kings death or demise ect. There is no way to avoid this. Your king will die and you will be forced to play a new king. Choices are either or, do one thing and get X result which may include both good and bad outcomes, or choose the other option witch may include good and bad outcomes. Outcomes usually add or decrease from your treasury, military, population, or church. Usually, if any of the four are diminished completely, your king will be either killed or something else bad. This is the game entirely. That is all there is to it. choose left or right, yes or no, good or bad. That is the whole premise of this game. Again, it doesnt matter if your choices are right or not. A good choice for example, may help the population greatly, but completely drain the treasury or church or army. So your king loses and is either killed or dethroned.Basically your going to lose. You try to make choices to keep your king in power. But your still going to lose."

If you're a visual person, there's every chance this might bother you, particularly if you don't like the sort of art style they're going for. (Check screenshots if this is you first.)The gameplay is very basic, and one of those ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kind of situations. I've done several playthroughs, and I still am not sure how to do the fencing minigame, for example.A single playthrough can be easily done in ten minutes, and in true quasi-roguelike fashion, one playthrough can sometimes affect subsequent ones.Expect to fail often, because the game very obviously is counting on it. That being said, the speed of your individual kings' lives make this far less frustrating than many other games of similar fashion, because you never really have time to get invested in a particular ruler. Also, your rulers don't exactly have much in the way of a personality (it's all just 'you') so there's no big loss when you die.The pick up and play factor is quite attractive, whether you're simply not a PC gamer as a regularity, or you're pressed for playtime. Casual players will probably find this game very appealing, as would someone with a laptop or otherwise low-powered machine. However, there's enough meat to the game that a more hardcore player simply looking for a change of pace would find this game appealing as well.All in all, based on price, depth, and ease of play, this is pretty much a no-brainer, as far as I'm concerned."
,Recommended,474750,25219645,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,RAVVA,"This game is kinda of a role play game and is very good if you like choose your own adventure types. Only problem with it is after a few hours of gameplay I  find it becomes repetitive  and feels like the same thing of balancing finances, your reputation with the church and the people, whilst keeping your army up to par to defend againist invading kingdoms.

Let’s get rocking.Here’s What’s UpI liked this game. There’s not much to it, so I don’t feel like a long review is really that necessary. I’m just going to go ahead and get down to brass tacks here.This game is very minimalist. The entire game consists of you being presented with choices and having to choose between one of two courses of action. Either choice will affect your reign as King. It could lengthen it or it could shorten it. Sometimes it doesn’t do anything at all (at least, not at first). You need to strike a balance between the Church, the people, the army, and your wealth if you want to rule for a long time. When I played, my longest time on the throne was 33 or 35 years. My shortest time was, I think, 4 years. Things can go sideways fast and, honestly, it’s really entertaining.Each time your King dies, is deposed, etc, a new king takes his place. The game essentially starts over and you continue making choices. That’s all there is to it.Verdict: YeaFor how cheap it is, Reigns is a fun game and solid time killer. It’s definitely one of those games that evokes the “just one more” mentality and you’ll find yourself playing it for longer than you’d expect. If you’ve got a couple bucks sitting around, I’d definitely recommend adding Reigns to your collection."

You pick an option by chosing the left or the right when the card comes up. Like Tinder but instead of setting up a date you're managing a kingdom and you have four factions, The Church, the People, the Army and the Merchants, that you have to manage. They get too low? The people will riot and the merchants buy out your kingdom? They get to high? The pope takes over your kingdom so leave them in the middle alright?Each option will have an effect, it could be to change the metersor it could be to  unlock something for the future playthroughs becuase you will be playing through as more than one king. If you've played Rogue Legacy you'll be used to the idea of generations and that's what you have here. You can unlock buildings that might help in a famine or unlock new people that will give you access to new cards and situations. The game is cheap, it's fun and it's addictive.

,Recommended,474750,24836601,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,Reist Windhunter,"An interesting take on ""weighed decision-making"" roleplaying. At first, I read other reviews and agreed about 30 minutes in and thought ""Yeh, this is mostly luck based"". And that is partially true. Most cards come up at random, and its really the luck of the draw. But believe me: when you are sitting at home playing Solitaire, it is ALSO the luck of the draw, is it not?Anyway, the game is fair, and when you begin to balance the weighed choices to the point where your rule is lasting over 30 turns/years, you get what the game wants. The turn-based style works very well, and allows different effects, such as establishing trade routes to increase money the more you think about the next decision. But what's more intriguing is that unlike most RPG's or Strategy games where if you get a max out on everything it just stays there, it actually causes your reign to end. If you become too rich in power, you end up choking on food from the lust of power and greed of welfare. You become over-populated? Your kingdom riots the streets. Your army too strong? They overthrow you. Religion becomes too Zealous? You become a martyr for the church.All in all, it's a really interesting game, and definitely am enjoying it so far. It can be frustrating at times, but what is nice is that you can only move forward as you fail, and the more you fail, the more you learn what choices NOT to make.Definitely a hidden gem of a game, and definitely worth $3 (which is what I like most about this well-rounded game).Am enjoying it so far, and highly recommend to anyone looking for a casual, and simple RPG/Strategy-based game.8/10 (ALSO, TURN DOWN THE VOLUME, THE SFX ARE LOUD!!

Lo and behold, I was sucked into this ""one or the other"" simplistic (yet extremely clever) card game for an hour and a half and loving every second of it. Every time I started to think the game was losing steam, a new, refreshing option/subplot would surface and make me question what else the game had to offer.

With it's very simple ""swipe left or swipe right"" mechanic to make your decisions, you are choosing whether or not your kingdom with prosper or fail. While the game does have some sense of strategy involved, it also forces a bit of randomization upon you that will make each time you play the game feel fresh and unique. And having one of your rulers die is just part of the fun!It's all about managing your four key resources - your Religion, People, Army, and Money - all of which you  neither want to be too high or to low. If one resource is really high, you risk the chance of being overthrown by that force - if it's too low, you risk the chance of you or all of those people dying or rebelling against you. Then, of course, you have the randomization. Occasionally, your king will die from outside forces that are simply out of your control - but that's part of the fun.The game also has the occasional battle mechanic - a cute little minigame that your swiping left or right helpts to decide the outcome of the battle. You will either want to push the battle or defend. And each time, you'll get a little better once you've gotten used to the mechanics of it.All in all, this game is a lot of fun. I think the only thing that I'd like to see from the game is an option to choose whether you are male or female. Being able to be the queen vs always being the king, would make it a lot more appealing to a female audience, in my opinion. Or even going back and forth, depening on whether or not one of your heirs (Oh, yeah, did I forget to mention that you could get married and have children in the game?) was a male or a female, would make the game feel a lot more interesting and as if the choices and actions that happen in each game feel as if they had an impact upon your gameplay.I'm looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future!!"

You do this by managing between the church, populace, army and the treasury. They're respresented by a metre and so if any one of them is too high or too low then you'll face one of many types of deaths. It's not that complicated of a game but the hook for it is that the more you play the more you uncover. You have goals to accomplish like ruling for king for sixty years or be involved in an affair. You unlock new decks that carry out new questlines and encounters which helps spice things up every now and again.This is quite a nice little game with a fun idea. It does it well and the presentation is well done plus it's one of those games with good water cooler talk so you can tell your friends weird stories on how you met the Devil or how you arranged a wedding for some werewolves. The price of admission is also very nice. It does get a bit repetitive after awhile so I'd suggest playing it in short bursts or maybe get the iOS or Android version.

,Recommended,474750,25387853,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,the von Essence,"A seriously addicting game that puts you in the shoes of several dozen cursed medieval kings. You're tasked with keeping the kingdom - consisting of the Church, the people, the Army, and the treasury - in balance; nothing can be too powerful or too weak, or you'll meet a sorry end.Gameplay is super simple; the game started out as an Android and iOS app, and the basic swiping mechanics carried over. You can use either the mouse or the spacebar and arrow keys to make decisions and progress in the game. Your choices are generally pretty limited to ""yes"" or ""no"", but the scenarios and characters are interesting enough that that doesn't matter, and with over 600+ cards in-game, it's going to take a handful of playthroughs to get bored.The only negatives I've got to offer on Reigns are: 1. ""Winning"" the campaign is a ridiculously difficult puzzle; even if you can figure out what you're supposed to aim for, actually getting there is tricky, with the majority of critical in-game clues being impossibly subtle. 2. Getting all the achievements isn't realistic - not only because viewing all 600+ cards is, in the dev's own words, all but impossible, but because the game is so absurdly repetitive after 5-6 consequetive playthroughs you'll be left wanting to smash your head against the wall (although maybe that's just a me problem). 3. The kings' names. Oh, my God. It's like the dev's never read anything but an English history textbook. You're a king in a world where witches, werewolves, and dragons run abound, but there's only two or three fantasy names thrown in the mix, and the rest are just endless repeats of Henrys, Roberts, Geralds, and Harrys (with the occasional ""Thomas"" and ""Cedric"" for variety).TL;DR: Really fun game. Super addicting. Gets boring after 5-6 consequetive playthroughs."

However, over time and undercurrent emerges that requires you to stop thinking of the year to year and think in terms of centuries. This game is elegant in its showing rather than telling.

But then, I found myself just clicking on one side or the other over and over again without reading anything just to see if this game actually had a point.The ends of my monarchies became very repetitive. I guess I saw about 8 to 10 ways to die? Well, there was one where my monarch didn't die, but he wasn't king anymore, either.I thought this game would be similar to ""Long Live the Queen"", but it doesn't have nearly the depth. Your choices have consequences? Yeah, I suppose. The same 8 or 10 generic consequences. In my opinion, the members of the court are all insane. Well, why not? They stay the same, century after century, while the monarch is all the changes. Ever time a monarch gets married, his wife has the same name.I have a hard time saying this was even worth the 3 dollars. Try ""Long Live the Queen"", instead, I say. Its 10 bucks. Get it on sale. It's at least more interesting than this. And no, I have no connection to the devs of ""Long Live the Queen"". I just honestly think it is a much better kingdom ruling sim than this, not that it's perfect, either.

However, as you continue to reign after reign, things do start to get repetitive until the game offers you a new scenario or introduces you to a new character.Upon completion of a first play-through, I realized that the game actually has some long play to it and a very complex and random set of tasks to complete in order to get ‘the good ending’. I wasn’t up to the task but the thought was interesting. Achievements and in-game menus push you towards 100% completion by showing just how much of the game you’ve seen but at the same time, things do really slow down after a while. Once you’ve run into the same dude asking to you to build a dam for the 18th time the game loses its initial charm.It’s usually pretty cheap ($1.50) and also available on mobile platforms! The game is not meant to be played for hours at a time, it is instead meant to be played briefly on occasion so I would recommend the mobile version."

Long live the King!Reigns is a port of a mobile game where you get to play as a dynasty of monarchs over hundreds of years, in a centuries long quest to escape a deal with the devil. It's designed very simply, with the gameplay deriving from a card deck that presents different events and decisions to make. When a card comes up with a decision to make, you swipe left or right to indicate what course of action you will take. The deck has hundreds of cards that come up randomly in sequences, so while you will have repeat events, there is a wide variety of scenarios.It is essentially a resource management game taking the form of a royal choose-your-own-adventure. You play the new King, who has just risen to power in a deal with the devil, that will affect his dynasty for millennia. Your goal is to rule over your kingdom well and keep yourself from being horribly killed. You do this by balancing four resources/factions: the church, the people, the military, and the treasury. The strength of these factions is represented by bars at the top of your screen. Every decision you make adds and/or subtracts from one or more of these factions, raising or lowering the bars. If you ever go too far in the extreme and hit the top or the bottom of any of the bars, you will die based on a scenario related to that extreme. You may last a short time or a long time, but ultimately you will end up dead, most likely not of natural causes. After you die, you'll play the new King, and will have to do the same thing. Throughout all of this, you are trying to meet a few people and accomplish a few things to ultimately break free from the devil. This all continues for around 1400 years (though it's basically only a counter, as technology advancement and history do not really exist). At the end of this time, you get one of three different endings, of which the best ending is very hard to obtain (though there are walkthroughs).The aesthetics of the game are minimalistic, with simple character designs for its cast, basic Simlish-style voices, and basic background music. I think this was a design choice more than a lack of resources, and actually think the overall aesthetic and ambiance suits the game quite well. Even though the music is sparse, it doesn't really get annoying or feel out of place, and is very much treated as just in the background.The game is short; about 3-4 hours. Gameplay is extended by trying to obtain all of the different cards and achievements, related to deaths, courtiers, and accomplishments. Since cards randomly come up, it will take time to collect them all; even with over 10 hours played and three playthroughs I have not quite seen all of the cards.Overall I think this game is quite good for its value. It's simple enough to not be too intense, and us very easy to pick up. At the same time, there is enough depth to keep you interested, and enough to discover in-game and to collect to keep you occupied for awhile. I expect to come back to it every once in awhile to try to collect more cards and achievements."

However, for 2.99, a couple hours of playtime is pretty good. It's probably a game I would play again every now and then too. It's simple but charming, and quite clever."

So, what do i think about this game: I feel like it doesn't really have anything to offer - it gives you choices (that may or may not affect you - the game doesn't say, it just affects you in a positive or negative light without telling you why) The game feels to simple and that's not a compliment here: everything's waay to plain and it feels more like a game of luck rather than a game of skill.I wouldn't buy it, but i can't really complain with what i was given. If it was free - - then yeah it's worth getting."

Lots of different events and things that happen to the player, and the inclusion of different endings makes it even better. To get the best ending, you really have to think outside the box, and I love that. There is only a couple frivolous things I would like added, such as when your king recieves a title, a future king is also able to get the same title. I found towards the later years, hardly any of my kings got titles, because all of my first kings got them. Another addition could be the inclusion of more names for your king, as there is a large amount of repetitiveness. 9/10, would recommend."

However, after having completed that hour, I am quite sure that one hour is all that is required to get the full understanding of this game, or at least enough to leave a review.You play as a King and have to keep in balance the Church, the People, the Military, and the Coffers. Reaching 0 or 100 of any of these four will result in the death of the King. The goal is to complete certain short-term objectives but ultimately to simply reach the high score by reigning as long as possible. Your reign conists of certain persons approaching you with a question, a problem, or an offer, and so on, and you have to ""swipe right"" or ""swipe left"", simply choosing between the two options.PROS:+Simple, but good-quality entertainment+Funny+Dark af+Good writing, if simple+Enough to keep your attentionCONS:-Perhaps too simple-Eventually will get repetative- It can sometimes be hard to follow and keep up with everyone and everythingIt's definitely entertained me for the hour I've played it, and I plan to play more. I hope they add more stuff. I also hope there's an option to start over, but I haven't seen it yet.TL;DR:It's simple, it's entertaining, it's cheap. If you're looking for something between games, consider Reigns.8/10"

Ballancing the power of all the factions is interesting, and the art style has lots of personallity.  This is really a moble style game, but I dont feel bad having paid a few dollars on the PC for it.  I might actually get it for the phone as well, as I'll likely give it more play time that way.  Good game for sure!"

You forget you have it in your library, see it a few months later and think ""Oh yeah, I forgot I bought that,"" install it, then get REALLY FREAKING ADDICTED to it.Seriously, I think I played this game for hours on end and never got tired of it. It's surprisingly addictive.Reignsputs you in the role of a king managing his kingdom. The ""cards"" are the various advisors of your kingdom asking you to make binary decisions for all of their problems. The decisions you make impact the four meters you are attempting to keep balanced. The four meter bars that are constantly in flux are: Religion, People, Army, and Money. The goal is to keep these meters from hitting 100 or 0; if they hit 100 or 0, you will die. And then you get to play as another king! Over and over and over again! Yaaaay! Also, the Devil has put a curse on you, and you will lose the game after a couple thosand years have gone by if you are unable to ""trick"" him (which gives a few alternate endings). The game is meant to be replayed over and over to experience all the deaths, all the storylines, all the cards (and accumulating all the different advisors and people you can interact with), all the ""fights"" (easy and silly little combat games with a few characters), and the alternate endings.The game is played using your arrow keys and only your arrow keys. All you have to do is ""swipe left"" or ""swipe right."" I believe the game was originally designed for tablets/phones, thus the ""swiping"" mechanic, but it works fine for PCs as well. The controls are super simple and intuitive.The art of the game is kind of pixel-ish? Very blocky edges. But that doesn't mean I don't like the art style! I find the art to be endearing and appropriate to the game.If you're looking for a relatively quick game (maybe less than 8 hours to see all the content?) that can be picked up cheap in a Steam sale, this is a game worth considering!"
