This game definitely has been programmed by the Leprechaun. I got tricked.Worst aliasing simulation ever.- Additional edit in 2017 : I really would like people to flag this ""game"" and explain in detail that it basically is a throwout of money towards the ""developer"". It is in no way correct that people are still able to spend money on this. Things like this are the community's duty to flag properly so it can get removed. It just popped up in my store tab, even though i own it already, which i really regret. Anyways this kind of things have no place in Steam. I really recommend flagging this. I am in no way trying to profit from this, nor am i hindering a development process. I have a clean conscience because i think i have to follow my call of duty to help Steam as a platform to get rid of such things in here."

I should have listened and NOT buy this game, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt but was just disappointed in the end.No players in multiplayerVery few zombie spawns and when you do find em they spawn a min after you kill em.Loot spawns every min on the ground. Though it'd be better if the loot comes from zombies or from stuff inside buildingsClass selection. In a survival game? Are you insane? I understand that it's mixed with action but I didn't expect it to be like that.Those who said this game was like a cheaper version of Rust was a lie, I don't technically have the game yet or played it myself but I watched Bob and Markiplier play this and it was far better than this crap.You glitch through an invisible hole on the ground and gets you stuck for a good 2 mins.I like the textures I admit but the rest is just awful.You can't even climb the stairs and just fall off when you get to the top.I'm done.Play Unturned, it's free, better and more fun than this game.This game is not worth it.But if you want to sate your curiousity then be my guest.

And two, I couldn't hold in my curiosity after seeing the many creative reviews. I didn't even care enough to make a desktop shortcut when it asked me to. While I created my character I picked the first model I saw just to get away from the laggy menu screen. I loaded into a desert, I imedietly noticed the great world design. Then I moved. I was suprised with the amount of lag, I thought that it wouldn't have any lag since it doesn't even need 2GB of RAM to run. After puting 6 minutes into the game I would like for two things to change. One, more graphics choices. And two, an option the kill yourself in-game. 2/5, has potential."
,Not Recommended,474790,29657946,Posted: 2 February,all,gamerhoofster-pony,I am confused on this game. I was looking through my library for a game to play and saw Pixel Day-Gun Z. I never bought it nor recived it as a gift. Anyway I downloaded it and played it...gane is aweful and let me explain way.1. There is no tutorial to explain what to do. You create a character and hit play. You are thrown in a map and left to figure things out. Took me 10mins to figure the inventory button...its E.2. There is no in-game setting to adjust sound or graphics nor anything. You play with settings you are given.3. The graphics are what you expect in a pixel theme game but the graphics don't render right such as cliff sides having black strikes appearing & disappearing at random.4. The zombies will spawn at random. I encountered a zombie every 2 minutes.5. Items will respawn after you move 20 inches away. Farming is mega easy on this game.6. Couldn't figure what the metal and wood is used for because of no tutorial.Overal this game felt like it was mimicing Unturned but failed. Pixel Day-Gun Z felt like it was made in three days and put on steam. This game gets a 2/10 score. I mean for dragons sake the store page video lags every second. Anyway this is my review for Pixel Day-Gun Z

Playing Battlefield 4 at very high settings = 45-60 fps.

,Not Recommended,474790,24946717,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,BippoErnesti,"Like ""Pixel Survival - Craft Game"" and ""Uncrowded"", Pixel Day - Gun Z is a broken asset flip. To the game's credit, the environment is not the same you get in the other ones, but it manages to be more broken.Most buildings in the game have at least one wall, staircase or floor that your character will just phase through, often times getting you stuck in places you can't get out from without restarting.The game also has a distinct lack of enemies and items more often than the other games in this ""style"". It took about 20 minutes for me to encounter a single enemy the first time around.You could buy another game from Steam for the same price and chances are you'd be better off with that game than Pixel Day - Gun Z."

It turns out to be an OK game. There's still alot the developer(s) need to fix and add to the game. Here are just a few of things that I think should be fixed/added:-Pickaxe-Mining to get metal fragments-Furnaces to smelt ores to get metal fragments from-Pictures of the items in your inventory-Fix picking up items (As of now you have to look for a while to find the spot on which you can pick it up from)-Ground clipping and glitching-Loot inside of buildingsOther than that I think it's a pretty cool game to be honest. The game doesn't require alot to run which is kinda cool, and I think it's funny that the arms, weapons and buildings you place yourself is unturned-like.At this state i would rate this game 6/10, but if a few things that I mentioned would get added I would rate it higher."
