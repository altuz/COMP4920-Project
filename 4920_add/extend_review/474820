I'm really just not impressed. I don't know. The price is low, obviously. And with the killer -0.01 sale, it seemed like a steal. The atmosphere is the whole point, as you can see in the little trailer. It's like a painting you can interact with. The game really pulled me in at first.But eventually, I got bored. After like 5 minutes. That would have been fine if the game moved on and there was more to see. Eventually it did. After like 3 minutes, when I figured out the little puzzle (which got to be a grind even with the low time I have on the game). And I don't want to spoil the ending, but I was disappointed. It just felt... stupid.I do not hate this game. I think it's a decent little piece of art. But because of how short it is and the obvious lack of replayability, I can't recommend it."

The Magical Silence has been a little different of an experience for me as far as Steam games go.I didn't know what to expect with this one. For under a quid and with one achievement seemed tempting enough for me to bite the bait- but afterwards I have beel left wondering: was that really worth it?The art in this one is really beautiful, and the music is nice too. Big thumbs up on the visuals for this game... the game itself however? I'm finding this harder to praise. I suppose the ""puzzles"" (If you can call them that?) are simple enough to work out... but executing them was a different story. Some of them seem a little buggy and it can take a while to trigger something that you know you have already tried so many times before... On top of this, this game was incredibly short (and sad!). Had the game been maybe 4-5 levels of the main bulk of the game, I might be giving it a different score... But for now it almost seems like a buggy musical screensaver. (Speaking of screensavers, I noticed that leaving the game untouched for maybe 5+ minutes makes the scroll funtion stop working? Not sure if anyone else has experienced this).+ Good for Trading cards+ Good achievement+ Excellent artwork- Buggy- Too short :("
,Recommended,474820,30283075,Posted: 2 March,all,Kovic,"Literally a 10 minute experience... however, it has just the one achievement and the game itself is really odd, so I strangely enjoyed those ten minutes.Basically, you are in a dog's mind and you have to click a bunch of stuff in this fantastical world to solve some rather basic puzzles.  This all takes place on one stage, which you simply scroll up, down, and around to find different things to click on and interact with.The most difficult thing I had to figure out was the final thing to do...getting the birthday cake from the bottom boat.  It took me a solid five minutes of shooting at tv's to finally have the birthday cake appear... still have no for sure idea what I did to make it appear.  One tip though, I finally made it appear by simply shooting straight down from the boat, instead of shooting all around at the flying tv's, not sure if that was pure luck or what.  Also, don't POP the bubble until it safely reaches the top dinner plate.  ;)All in all, I'm good with spending the $0.49 I spent on this.  Normally I would rip into a game with such little content for simply not being free, but like I said, this game was unique enough to have caught my attention.  Then again, maybe I was just in a good mood today or I liked the fact the one achievement gave me another easy ""100% game"".***To get the achievement you have to finish the game... which means pulling out the stool...  very strange."

I'm ambialent about this; I'm going with thumbs down, because it's got a few technical issues, and not everyone loves point-click-puzzle games. If you don't love those, don't bother.PROS:Charming and surreal artworkPleasant music (for me, at least)Unique, clever puzzlesCONS:No save function (but it's short and simple enough that this is barely even annoying)Froze after minimizing and restoring (again, not an actual problem)Puzzles very non-intuitive, to the extent of ""what did I do, so I can stop clicking on that thing trying to get it to do something else?""Endingis depressing and unsatisfying.If you do love point and click puzzles, and you don't mind spending money for the game (yes, it's only a dollar, but if you're being careful about money, this is not the bargain game to pick up), it can be fun. There's nothing wrong with it (except needing to restart from the beginning which takes less time than many games take to load); it's just not as intriguing nor as enjoyable as I'd hoped.This isn't, ""this game sucks;"" this is ""meh, you can probably find a better use for you dollar."" But if you adore point and click puzzles and would like to try one with a different approach - the puzzles are nicely different from most - you're not likely to feel cheated."

One, that it would be entirely free to play. Secondly, that you were in a conversation with someone who wanted a quick and dirty example of what Moon Logic is, and what kind of puzzles it makes in the adventure genre.This game is everything that is wrong, and what killed the P&C Adventure genre back in the days. You must click on stuff with no rhyme or reason. Must do so in a specific sequence, arbitrarily decided by the dev, things that used to be interactable will become useless, things that were useless will become interactable. Also in this case you must sometimes click at a specific pace, and deliver items from point A to point B without any indication from the game on what you are expected to do. Pure trial and error.There is under 10 mins of gameplay here but if you were stubborn and refused to use any cheat, you could, if you are unlucky, stay stuck for hours because of faulty puzzle design. The sound and art design was half decent for what this was on offer, and the twist ending was a nice touch. Not that it matters since I ended up loading a Youtube video of the playthrough when I realized what I was dealing with here. In the end, that is probably the best way to enjoy this title."

Perhaps that is valued in the indie games when not necessary to pay huge sums to please the eyes and ears of the player and give him some memorable and emotional moments. Here is concentrated the maximum of imagination and abstract thinking of the subconscious mind of an ordinary person, experiencing the confusing feelings of depression and lack of something more. Overall, for such a fair price, you will receive much, if will be able to experience and feel what is happening. But even without this, there is a very cute and pleasant to the ear music. The gameplay itself here and not the most important, but the echoes of it are present, though the first time it is not clear what exactly you want, but gradually you get drawn in and quickly understand. It is possible to complain only achivku very short duration (I counted at least another couple of similar rooms... that would be awesome) and the ending.

Наверное, именно и ценится в инди-играх – когда необязательно выкладывать огромные средства, чтобы порадовать глаз и слух игрока и подарить ему несколько запоминающихся и эмоциональных минут. Здесь сосредоточен максимум воображения и абстрактного мышления подсознания обычного человека, испытывающие запутанные чувства депрессии и нехватки чего-то большего. В целом, за столь справедливую цену, вы получите многое, если сможете прочувствовать и проникнуться происходящим. Но даже без этого здесь есть очень милая картинка и приятная уху музычка. Геймплей как таковой здесь и не самое важное, но отголоски его присутствуют, хоть и первое время совершенно не ясно, что конкретно от тебя хотят, но постепенно втягиваешься и быстро во всём разбираешься. Можно вполне посетовать на единственную ачивку, очень уж малую продолжительность (я рассчитывал хотя бы ещё на парочку подобных комнат… это было бы шикарно) и концовку. Но вообще, не стоит упрекать столь самобытное видение автора подсознания человека. Я считаю, что игра, в принципе, стоит своих денег и отбивает их по ощущениям.
