But I just can't recommend a game with simply far too many bugs that have gone seemingly ignored and unsquashed by the dev. One of which crashed the game and caused every single achievement to unlock."

,Not Recommended,474910,34331790,Posted: 18 August,all,acid rain,I like hard games but this one seems to be unfair on purpose and the whole power-up thing kinda ruins the game.Rather spend your money on something nice.
,Not Recommended,474910,26055055,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,Severus Snape,"There are no bug in this updated version of the game.But I don't recomand this game because the idea of the charm and the power-ups is fine, but it does not work how it should be. Its designed bad (you must use too much power ups to pass a level) and makes the game boring after few hours.I'm sad because there are good ideas behind this game, but the implementation does not sodisfy me."
,Recommended,474910,26452332,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,kony,"I have never played Mahjong before, but this game got me into it. Decent tutorial too. Mediocre music, very nice backgrounds, great graphics, nice sound effects, and overall very enjoyable Mahjong game. On a downside, sometimes you are required to use special powers to complete a map (and you have limited ""powers"", which are saved from map to map, so you can actually lock yourself out if you overuse it), and there are boss fights, which are a different kind of game - rare, but still, I'm not running a mahjong game to play something else. Not sure if I'd recommend it for the full price, but on a sale it's a good game to get, especially if you want to learn Mahjong but are too lazy to read how to play the game.I'll probably abandon it after a few hours of a gameplay, but it's still alright and I finally learnt how to play Mahjong."
,Not Recommended,474910,29589999,Posted: 30 January,all,Thetigerisariver,"I bought this game ridiculously discounted, so seeking a refund is really not worth my time, but that is the only reason I am not getting one.If you play this game and ask yourself the question ""Wait, did the devs not write a collision algorhythm that ensures the boards are actually solvable?"" then rest assured they really didn't. Which in my opinion makes the game fail at the very basics of a solo mahjong game. It's a shame, because I otherwise enjoy the cheese of the game itself and would even be willing to overlook the typos and similar issues.Save yourself the stress and avoid this."
,Not Recommended,474910,25999397,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,<<CYB3R_WOLF>>,"This game makes me want to crawl up the ceiling and it never happened before in similar games. The story is transparent, basically like the 80% of those kind of games,nothing new.(Why everyone is copy-pasting those storylines? I mean cmon theres so much options, why? ) Very frustrating bugs, like the one when you use your ""shuffle"" power and then the tiles shuffle, but have no image on them and you cant do anything than restart the game and you wont get back your energy. Makes you use too much powers, i think its ridiculous you cant finish it without using any power at least once and there are those objectives ""finish the game without using any powers"" , its not freaking possible! You will run out of moves every couple moves. Also there where couple rules  she mentioned outside of tutorial and not about the powers and if you forget what she said, theres no way you can read it second time. Why its not inside the tutorial aswell? Those ridiculous energy crystals you will be forced to use, once you run out of them, theres pretty much no way you can finish the game and you will end up playing the level over and over and over and over ... and over ... and over ... again ..till you will be just done with the game.The gameplay goes like this : No moves left, no moves left, no moves left, no moves left, no moves left, no moves left, no energy crystals left, play over, play over, play over, play over, play over, play over ... until you will want to avada kedavra it to the moon.The only nice things about this game are the art, music and steam achievments and cards.Probably the first game i will return..."

,Recommended,474910,31310985,Posted: 22 April,all,PESUkarhuVISIO,"Rather clever Mahjong Solitaire with new gimmicks, power ups and a background story which can be skipped if chosen to. Tile sets are beautiful."
,Not Recommended,474910,29767164,Posted: 7 February,all,Tabascofanatikerin,"It's a joke.How am I suppoused to beat ""Mahjong Huntress"" or even progress when I'm stuck?I'm stuck at level 8 and have replayed it more than a dozen times but can't beat it. The stones always lie so badly that sooner or later the possible pairs are gone and it's ""Game Over"". Also I'm out of power ups (or power up juice) because I had to use them before to get that far.And don't get me wrong: I'm not a beginner in Mahjong: I've played it a lot, it's one of my favourite puzzle games and time wasters. So I notice which pairs are good to remove at one moment and which ones aren't.And it's not even like I can buy powerups or other helpful elements (mictro transactions) to get further. Not that I miss that but I'm very surprised, though...So: No, look for other Mahjong titles. This one is pretty much broken, designed badly and not fun.Last but not least: The story. Yes, there's a story around all the levels about a young British lady (you) trying to solve a mystery of her disappeared fiancé. She doesn't love this future husband but must find him or else she and her family get suspected and have to live in shame. Now if that's not motivating enough to get through this broken game, I don't know...My guess is that her fiancé got stuck pub getting wasted just like how I got stuck in the game. I don't care anymore."
76561198060604141,Recommended,474910,23210933,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,cynestsadista,"It's a fun game with a surprising increase in difficult the further you dive into the story.There are multiple timers that contribute to level challenge bonuses as well as in-game bonuses & power ups. Some mahjong games set up the tiles randomly, but this one obviously follows a type of algorythm where the game wont screw you on the first few steps, offering you a short grace period before you run into issues. (There's one puzzle I couldn't get more than 15% complete before having to use every power up I could, eventually resorting to using most of my crystals to completely refill the powerup bar.) As you progress through the storyline you'll find yourself needing to use these power ups more and more as the puzzles get more difficult. One of the power ups will reshuffle the board.There's a neat feature that allows you to remove a tile from the board and hold onto it to match later, but you have to match it before being able to pick up another one. There are hundreds of challenge puzzles available that don't affect the story portion of the game.Another portion of the game involves ""boss fights"" that play very similarly to games like Bejeweled or Pokemon Shuffle. The instructions for these games aren't explained very well, so it took a while for me to catch on. There are health orbs for yourself and the enemy. The bar next to the health bar shows which color orbs will give you ""crystal energy"" to attack. For the entirety of the first boss fight, I had to avoid matching purple orbs or I would get attacked. Each time I was able to attack, my color changed.The achievements are buggy right now but the game just came out so it should get fixed soon."

I got stuck on level 8 (billiard room) and it was on this level that the game ate 3 of my little magic powerups and I had to restart it to keep playing. Downloaded on my mac and I can't exit the game without a force quit or taking it out of fullscreen mode. It looks gorgeous on the retina screen! but super annoying to exit. I also tried adding a new profile while playig on my mac, and was unable to type a player name. It worked again after restarting the game.The game just came out, so there's bound to be minor annoyances and buggy things."

,Recommended,474910,24319306,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,clint,"The best Mahjong game I've ever come across.The Mahjong Huntress embeds the classic tile matching game into a story, in which a young woman has to find out what happened to her fiance. In order to progress through the story, the player has to solve the boards which unlock hints about the fate of the young man.Apart from simply cleaning the board of tiles, there are a number of objectives which contribute to the player's energy bar. Depending on its charge, the player is able to use certain powers which can put an already lost game back onto the path to success. Another nice feature is the combo system, which is basically a timer counting down a few seconds between each move, awarding more points if the player managed to match several tiles within the ever decresasing intervals.The difficuilty of the boards is steadily increasing, forcing the player to sacrifice speed in favor of choosing the right tiles. Unwisely chosen matches will quickly force the player to sacrifice his energy for above mentioned special powers. But beware - once the energy is depleted, the player will have to start over with simpler boards to recharge the energy bar.In addition to the story mode there are more than 230 so called mystery boards, which are offering a wide range of tile layouts to choose from right from the start.The presentation is very nice, offering pleasant visuals along with a functional and intuitive user interface.If you were searching for a Mahjong game, you've just found it. Especially with the very low price tag attached there is absolutely no reason not to recommend it.Info: The Mahjong Huntress runs very smoothly under Linux as well. I've encountered no problems on my 64Bit-Ubuntu Linux configuration.UPDATE:So far I've encountered only a few bugs. Some minor graphic glitches, some spelling errors. Worst bug was a game crash after the boss fight in the mausoleum. After restarting, I couldn't progress because the game didn't open chapter 3 for me. I had to create a new player profile and start over."

IMO, it's a solidly executed version of mahjong with a few fun twists. The storyline (while basic and not particularly well integrated with the gameplay) adds a feeling of purpose to the proceedings, so you feel like you're doing more than just flipping tiles, and the timed ""combo meter"" and powerups add both strategy and urgency to a boardgame that can sometimes seem dull and mindless.Is it a must-play? No, but there's enough content and entertainment value to make it well worth the price of admission."
