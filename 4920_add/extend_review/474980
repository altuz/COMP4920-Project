,Recommended,474980,25153128,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Nyx,"This game is ridiculous and that's what makes it brilliant. I wish I'd got it on a 50% - 75% discount, to tell the truth, but if Steam achievements/cards are added in the future then I'll feel better about what I paid.IfCat President's story had taken itself seriously at all then I would have a lot of criticism for the gameplay. However, I didn't get the sense that this game was trying too hard in any way. It knows it's silly and the quality of it accentuates this. While some of the political satire came close to feeling like it was inclined one way or another to real world affairs, generally this is poking fun at both visual novels and life in general.There are limited options and so you can't turn the sound down or off unless you do so on your computer. Luckily the music isn't too frustrating. Easily ignored. While the character images don't particularly move much, I enjoyed the fact they were of actual cats, dogs, and people. Once you complete your first playthrough, you're able to blast through text you've already seen which makes it easier to get through further routes.I gotsexually harassed by a catand I liked it. God help me.As I've hinted, I think it is best to buy this when it is significantly discounted. If you see it for cheap and have a thing for the absurd, go for it. While I've played free games that are technically better, I don't find myself regretting this purchase too much."

If you're looking for comedy and a fun story, you'll like this. I also recommend playing with friends so you can give each of the characters different voices- this would be really fun for a letsplay video.The only thing I feel a little let down by is the lack of achievements- which would be perfect for this game :/UPDATE: I've played through every route and the bonus content- I'm tied between Kale and DJ Nibbles as best presidentmy biggest complaint now isWHERE IS THE BANDERS ROUTE?

You know-- reveal the sentences character by character.-With multiple characters on screen, it can be challenging to tell who’s talking. I wish they would highlight as they talk. When one cat says “That over there is thunderpaw”, I have no idea which of the other two cats he’s talking about,-Some sound effects during speech would be nice. For example, have a “meow” occur with new lines. As it is, there is no audio indication that someone is talking. I like how the Shantae / Zelda series handle this-- you often get a tiny voice clip when a conversation starts, such that you know you’re talking with someone, and know what their voice sounds like.-Starting the game, I assumed I was a cat, named myself “♥♥♥♥♥Pants”, then found out I was a human two scenes later. Gotta make that more clear from the get-go.-Kale and the Dr (the two cats in the hallway) look similar. It’s practically a guarantee they will be confused with one another.-Seeing as Lizzy’s a human actor, and is probably more receptive to pose suggestions than cats would be, it would have been nice to get different stills from her. As it is, she has this odd “stare-longingly-into-your-soul” still, which feels out of place in a few scenes.-A shame you don’t get to actually listen to the candidate’s responses in the initial debate. As we’ve seen from this IRL presidential election cycle, it can be tremendously entertaining.-Moving quickly through the dialogue, I would often get to a set of question responses, only to have forgotten what the question was. Please keep the question at the bottom of the screen."

,Recommended,474980,25167763,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,CUPHEAD,"TL;DR: This game was fun but all the free assets don't make it worth the current price.This game was pretty fun and I enjoyed it a lot. I only played one route so far, I got Kale's good route, but I do plan on going back and trying the other routes. Not sure if this was worth the current cost though ($8.09 on a sale, but full price is $8.99). The reason I feel this is because this was made using Ren'Py.Now, for those of you unfamiliar with the engine or game dev in general, Ren'Py is a really nice Python engine for making visual novel games. Most visual novels you've probably tried or will try are written in this. The reason for this being it has all the features of regular visual novels already built in. It's free, you can download it yourself and play around with it, but the main thing with it is it makes visual novel making so much easier that all the programming is pretty much done. All you really need to focus on is the writing, art, and sound, because Ren'Py is set so that you just have to assign the assets to variables and then use them in a kind of movie script.There's nothing wrong at all with using this engine, it's really ncie and convinient, but the problem is the assets using for the game. Most of them are free assets found online. So really when you pay for the game you're really paying for the script writing.Again, this isn't me saying this game is bad at all, and I can more than understand why a game dev would feel their game deserves to be priced the way it is. I don't know how much money was actually spent behind the scenes on this game, so maybe I'm wrong about some things. But to me, it definitely feels the price is a bit too high.Some have compared this game to Hatoful Boyfriend, and I can definitely agree on the resemblance since it's a funny concept visual novel and the birds in that seem like free or cheap assets as well, but that game has lots of assets that were made by the devs as well. In fact the birds even have human personas drawn by the devs. Meanwhile, this game doesn't seem to have any assets that are the actual dev's own creation. In the credits of this game, almost all images are attributed to Flickr.But again, I have no problem paying for writing and a fun experience. I don't regret this purchase at all, in fact I'm going to be playing it more for all the routes. I just don't think the current price is fair is all. Despite this, I don't feel this game was a rip off like others think. I think any dev has the right to charge whatever they want for their game and that if any buyer doesn't like what they got, just refund it. It's the dev's job to make the player not want to refund it, but also too many people buy visual novels these days and are disappointed when they find out it's not exactly a ""game"" game. That's not the dev's fault.ALSO one last thing, why isn't there an options menu? I want to adjust music volumes but there doesn't seem to be a way to do so. I know Ren'Py has a built in settings option, so why disable it?In conclusion, this game was fun and I hope you give it a chance, but if you don't agree with the price I understand. VOTE FOR KALE!"

The writing was surprisingly funny and provided good quality entertainment as I was going through it. Apt timing with the election coming up too. The only caveat is that some people find the price tag of 8.99 a little too high -- it could probably sell more dropped down a dollar or two, but I at least thought it was worth it once I played through the routes."

,Not Recommended,474980,28133853,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,Hanosandy,"While entertaining as a spoof, the novelty wore off after around 15-20 minutes for me.  The game play is as simplistic as it can possibly get.  The humor is bright and lively, sometimes even nuanced - but it tends to get more and more canned feeling later in the game.  I can't recommend this game, unless it is deep in sale territory.  It is worth around 30 minutes of entertainment if a point and click comedy game is your thing.  Don't expect much."

I usually dont play these kind of games but whatever. I started of with Kale who has the longest storyline  and there is a good mix of comedy that can catch you off guard but also good plot that keeps you playing to see whats going to happen. At first i thought all the storylines would be the same yet i was pleasently suprised when i finished them all as they all have different goals and challenges you have to face. As well as good plot twists at many different points of the story. I personally likes Kales and DJ Nibbles story lines the most as they were many points that had me burst out in laughter. I would like to see some Dlc for some of the minor candidates and banders or maybe  even a sequal! I would recomend this if you want funny dating sim but not if you want a serious one
