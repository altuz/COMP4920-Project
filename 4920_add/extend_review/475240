But then again, this can also be considered a pro.1/10. ""Stop playing video games and get a job""  :P"

The game trailer made me buy this game, but once I started playing it, it was fun and I immediately finished it. It's not to say that it's short, it's just that I'm a pro in difficult platforming games ha-ha. However, I would advise to turn off the music and just listen to something else (e.g. audiobook, podcast or your own music).http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769848611http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=750989899"

Music is ok but gets annoying after a while but the combat is satisfying and throwing secondary weapons is fun.

76561198004164250,Recommended,475240,28294572,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,ArtlessKnave,"I quite enjoyed this game for what it was. Sure, there are some things about it that aren't perfect mechanically, and it could certainly use some work. I bought this with the intention of wanting to support an indy developer as I am attempting to go through the same process.I played this game through to the end taking a little less than two hours, plus some time just messing around inside the game for fun.Pros:- Price.- Some entertaining, though at times, awkwardly written dialogue.- A variety of challenges from level to level; each level introducing something new.- Retro-esque graphics, if you're into that sort of thing.- A few hilarious references, my favourite being Mortal Kombat's Sub-Zero reference.- A short game; doesn't overstay it's welcome.- Appears to be easy, but looks are deceiving. Can be quite challenging!- Good for a few chuckles.- Addictive with a dash of charm.Cons:- Minor mechanical game issues:- At times I would push the thumb-stick one way and suddenly face the opposite direction when attacking.- Clipping into the side of moving platforms and floating for a bit.- If two weapons are on the ground and on top of each other, it reads as one pickup, destroying the second weapon.- Rendering issue where, at odd times, a frame would go completely black.- Enemy projectiles seem to continue through walls. (Died in a spectacularly hilarious way because of this)- Fairly repetitive combat as you can really only swing your sword or throw the item in hand. (Found that just running past enemies and dodging was the easiest way to power through this game).- Some parts are frustrating and annoying due to stacked enemy placement. This being different from a difficult situation, as some of these places you had no choice but to take a hit.I would say that this is a great prototype that doubles as a game. There are certainly a lot of things that the dev could do to improve upon what's already there and build this into something larger and more refined. It's clear that the dev was passionate about what he/she was doing and I have to congratulate them on releasing their game.Keep up the great work!7/10"

,Recommended,475240,23216977,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,D. Trump,"If you love Ghosts 'n Goblins or similar old school games, you won't be disappointed. The AI is frankly easy to read and learn but that is a good thing, because just like the older classics they place more of them and harder mobs as the game goes on to make things more challenging, and that is something that all of the classic platformers have in common and I think that is something that makes those games great. Players learn by playing not by reading some tutorial pre-game.Overall there are a few things I could say needed improvement but never-the-less I do see what the creator was going for and I sure as hell wasn't disappointed. 9/10 for nostalgia."
,Not Recommended,475240,29322926,Posted: 17 January,all,wtannerb,"Let me just first state that I tried very very hard to give this a recommendation but I just can't. As I play and discuss the game more, I will try to give it a recommendation.Pros:+Soundtrack ;D+Smooth graphics that look great+Full controller support+Challenging..+Pretty smooth overall+Low price+Controls are alright, above average I suppose+Haven't gotten any cards yet, but they're a plusMediocre:~The Orcs are inconsistently consistent. It appears that they will sometimes swing at you from say 6 pixels away and sometimes only when you're 4 pixels away. I don't know if this was meant to be but it makes it much more difficult to defeat them.~The GUI could be a little more developed~Level design. Somewhat unique, but they can also be long and repetitive.~The story is alright, just enough to make it enjoyable IMO but could be more.Cons:-Soundtrack ;( gets repetitive and very basic.. but it's so-so-Not a lot of ""menu"" type options, more focused on gameplay-When you die, for example, it instantly respawns you at the start with no message, I think at least something would be nice-Archers and Wizards-- unfortunately, these two will kill you before you can even see them. What I mean by this is say you're jumping up a cliff- as soon as you get to the top, an archer will one shot you. With Wizards, the same situation sometimes happens or oftentimes they'll kill you when you havent even seen one on the screen yet. Very annoying when you're trying to progress long levels.-Inconsistent knockback as well as some other things.. you'll hit an archer back and sometimes you can instantly swing again and kill it, other times you have to move towards it and swing again. This results in you inconsistently getting hit in this manner.-Several hitboxes are not precise. Additionally, sometimes your character will be floating above a block or your feet halfway into the block.-The aforementioned cons just make it frustrating to play overall without it appearing to be simply another ""challenge"" :/-I would like to see some more items/weapons/powerups-It seems sort of like an Early Access game, or even possibly a Flash game in this state.---Update: I accidentally pressed New Game instead of Load Game once and it reset all my progress. No confirmation or multiple saves? That's a big problem, especially when the game launches on the ""New Game"" menu option.---///In Conclusion///This game definitely has potential but I'd really like to see more out of it.A few things on these lists could be intentional to make the game harder, simpler, etc. by the Dev, but I just can't leave a recommendation. I will continue playing it and seeing if I like it more, I believe I'm about halfway through. I hate to leave negative reviews, and this is my first, so hopefully something the developer does will change my mind. Clarifications on anything from the Dev would help as well.Well, this is a very long review for a $0.49 game. Thanks for reading and I hope I was helpful!Edit: After accidentally pressing A on my controller twice when launching, it reset all my progress. That's pretty bad, so I don't feel bad leaving a negative review anymore."

76561198260534400,Not Recommended,475240,35215189,Posted: 25 September,all,clarkgmulvey3,"So the game is decent, I got it for like 50 cents, so it's definitely worth your money, but not your time.My biggest nitpicks are a few glitches, and a menu problem:The worst annoyance is the menu and the lack of being able to save a game. I played this game for a while man, and I got pretty far. Then I went to start the game up and it was lagging, so I started spamming enter (which is exactly what people do when they get impatient, what gamer doesnt?) and when the game actually loaded, the cursor started on the ""new game"" button. Long story short, it erased my game and I had to start over just because there's the capacity for one playthrough. There's not even an option to go back to a certain level if you've been there before. One small mistake and hours of gameplay are gone with no hope of getting them back, seriously dumb.In the game there are mobs that drop weapons, which you can then pick up, and throw them as a secondary attack. It's kind of cool because these dropped weapons are essentially a resource to use, and they are needed in many cases to pass the levels. There is a glitch when you kill two mobs with the same weapon (you should be getting two of the same weapon at this point) and they land in the same area. When you go to pick one of them up, it just picks them both up and you can only use one. They morph together or something. So basically depending on the rng of where the weapon drops, you have sporadic amounts of resources. It never was the determining factor of whether or not I passed a level, but it was still super annoying.Another glitch has to do with the time ticks for damage. I'm supposed to be able to throw these weapons at mobs, and it damages them, but somtimes if I throw two in a row very fast it only registers that one hits them. This can't be because of a mechanic that they can only be hit in a specific time frame, because you can throw a weapon and then smack it with your sword super fast. So basically you miss out on hitting them just because you are trying to be efficient (Which is super annoying) In fact, this glitch definitely made me not pass levels a lot, it was really frustrating."

,Not Recommended,475240,25963873,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Jereco,"So, the trailer and description of this game say that it is very hard and that is true. Primarily because the controls are not very tight and the designer likes to stack enemies so that you almost always die the first time through a level.However the biggest complaint I have for this game is that it forces the player to wait, all the time. Moving platforms that you have to wait for, enemy pathing that you have to wait for or be overwhlemed, everytime you die in the boss battles you have to click through the dialogue to begin the battle again. It kills you in cheap ways so you have to start the level over again. It just makes you wait all the time to inflate the play time. It took me 2.8 hours to beat and and at least 45min of that was waiting.This could have been a good game and I hope the developer tries again but this game is just so sloppy. The ""funny"" bits of the game are a fourth wall break and that the character likes chicken, a refrence to Castlevania I am sure. But the there is almost no story and what is there is generic. The ending dialogue even has a mispelled word.I cannot recomend this game, even for the .49c that I bought it at because my life was not enriched at all for even beating it. I am left frustrated and angry at the conclusion. This game was not fun."

It's up to you if this is a good thing or not.I enjoyed it, but I grew up on these games.  It does make one egregious sin, however; there is only one save, and the main menu defaults to New Game.  If you select that, it overwrites your save with no warning."

,Recommended,475240,29023226,Posted: 4 January,all,Faded Chocula | csgokingdom,"This game has me on the fence, but I'm leaning towards a positive vote for this game. I like the retro feel to it, from the graphics to the actual difficulty of the game (challenging but able to be beaten.) The sounds are also really good for a game of this stature. I wanted to support an indie developer and that was what sold me (and since when I bought it, it was .50 cents.) I even went ahead and bought two copies for my friends.However, it's not to say that this game doesn't have negatives. There are some things that need MAJOR work. Here's my list:Pros:- Retro feel.- Cheap.- Sound is good for a game this small.- Controller support.- Fun and challenging.Cons:- Feels cheap and lazy, like a project made to sell cheap.- Still has the Construct 2 icon for the taskbar - should get fixed.- While you can save the game, you cannot save your sound settings.- You have to recalibrate your gamepad each time you load the game.Overall, cheap and fun. Will be a good time waster, at least for a while.7/10"

Like, staple your balls to the wall HARD. teh bosses are challenging, but the first level of the fire area...it's just...so...IMPOSSIBLE. I think the creator DID test it, but with all the knowledge to beat the enemies. There are FEW HEALING ITEMS PER WORLD. I think it would be a bit easier if there was eitherA: more health (you could gain more each world to compensate for more damage) orB: a shop to buy more heatlh or damage upgrades, or even better, more healing items. It would use up the weapon slot, but it would heal all of your health (the 3 hearts that you have). I recommend it to HARDCORE gamers, or speedrunners (looks good to speedrun, like, seriously.)"
