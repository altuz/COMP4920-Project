,Not Recommended,475430,23679476,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,Miss Nemesis,"This game is horrible...The ""game"" consist of like 80% real life ""cutscenes"" which are not skippable. The cutscenes are as mentioned real life recordings with bad acting and jokes by the kids who made this abomination. 20% are actual gameplay which isn't even worth mentioning. There is no optimization in place, constant crashes, horrible FPS, long load times, extremely ugly maps with no artistic style whatsoever and cobbled together with standard GameGuru assets. On top of that the game has copyrighted music in the outro.DO NOT BUY THIS ""GAME""!I'd rather flush a euro down the toilet and watch it go, it's much more entertaining than this piece of garbage.Edit: As I've said the jokes are completely bad and pretty offensive. One was making fun of the holocaust. I am not going to quote this, because my review could end up being flagged as abusive."

It feels like im watching some 6year olds make home movies on a camcorder. The edit job is pathetic. They loop themselves standing still because they didnt wait long enough for some stupid dialouge to come through from another character. They even have someone scratching at bricks pretending to climb a wall... It feels like they are going for some sort of 'so bad it's funny' thing but that only works like 10% of the time and even then its far from remotely funny. The rest made me wince and cringe so hard it was ridiculous. You can't skip these long painful embarassing cutscenes because they make up the majority of  the game. Its honestly not even worth your time as a joke. The only funny part in this entire cluster ♥♥♥♥ was that at the end they put a paragraph about how they worked really hard on this. And also the 3 or 4 times in the game they tell you to leave a positive review. ♥♥♥♥ off you weirdos.It has no redeeming qualities other than it makes for some intense cringe content. not worth paying for though as im sure you will be able to find this♥♥♥♥♥♥on youtube.

,Not Recommended,475430,23692841,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,Proxykon,"""Kimulator : Fight for your destiny"" ('Kimulator' from here on) is a 'narrative first-person-shooter experience' of very short length and much less quality.Design & ArtThe gamerelies on the Gameguru Engine and that very poorly, in my opinion.The overall visual experience of Kimulator is, I would say,below average.Nothing in this game looks or feels visually impressive or enticing. Given the experience of the developer, (and this being his first game on the Steam storefront) this can be excused. There isno unique appearance though resulting in an impression of blandness. Everything used seems like it is just standard asset of the game engine. Disappointing.As for thecutscenes, which funnily enough comprise 75% of the actual game,are of same value. While the video quality is high, execution is just bad in my opinion: Actors break out of character by laughing about their own jokes, rephrase memes or say deliberately shocking things just to evoke some form of attention if you ask me. The game seems like it was actually going to be a movie production and, in my opinion, it should have, because it would have made a better impact than in its current form.ControlsStandard FPS-Controls, but NO tutorial for that.I assumed OUT OF EXPERIENCE that ""Shift"" is for sprinting and ""Ctrl"" is for crouching. Kimulator doesn't even tell you that you have to press the left mousebutton to shoot.There currently exists no option to rebind the keyboard layout.Soundeffect volumes can be changed, the change of music volume has no effect other than restarting the current track played.Sound and MusicPlayable parts of the main campaign are silent.Completely. I have no idea why, but this seems lazy. Soundeffects are mostly nonexsistant as well, only weapon sounds of unpersuasive quality as well as the occasional death screams are to be heard.The cutscenes are not heavily edited either. Most of the time there are no additions to the footage.Music, if there is any, consists of electronica or rock tracks. Nothing noteworthy, nothing original, noting impressive.Gameplay & WeakpointsAlright, this is where everything comes down.Just out of precaution, these are the specs the game ran on:Predator G9-591Intel Core i7-6700HQ16 GB RAM64-Bit Windows 10Nvidia GeForce GTX 970MThe game starts up with the main menu. There is no options screen. You can only change the options (even those of sound and music) ingame. Why that is, is beyond me.The mouse cursor changed to something unidentifiable. Irritating.Loading times are abhorrendly long for a game of this quality.I counted three times of loading longer than thirty seconds, while other games of same or less value load significantly faster.Once you are in the ingame menu, which is an open area you can move semi-freely in, choosing to play what you want by going in seperate hallways,you will be greeted with an explanation movie from the developer EVERY TIME YOU REVISIT THE MENU.This needs to be fixed asap.I played the extra games which are included in the game besides the main campaign first. Be aware, they have absolutely no context to the main game and, at the time of writing this review, consist of a rabbit jump-and-run-coin-collector (a.k.a. ""Fire-Rabbit Adventure 63""), a practice range (on which some enemies couldn't be killed), a loosely written zombie fighting story (a.k.a. ""There is Zombies in my Town"") and a digsite full of enemies you have to fight through (a.k.a. ""Meme Park"").Mind you that these ""Mini-Games"" are other Greenlight submissions BMC Studios made over the course of the last quarter and now simply imported them into the game that made it through. Defeats the purpose of Greenlight in my opinion and I am definitely against this tactic.Other than that, these ""Games"" add to no value to the game besides increasing the time played. There is no incentive to play or repeat them.Quality of these ""Mini-Games"" is questionable. I had textures changing after dying, weapons and ammunition didn't respawn after death while enemies did, rendering my advance impossible without a reload of the mission. The zombie game is overly bright and starts to produce visual lag without reason. Controls are incomprehensible at times (like stopping in mid-air, after jumping forward and releasing the forward key).Onto the main Campaign:All cutscenes are NOT SKIPPABLE,something I thought was a thing of the past. Some text displayed cannot be read completely because it is cut off at the sides. Formatting would help.Dying means starting over, if you didn't save. The game never tells you that you have the possibility to do so at any time by opening the Menu screen.Whenever you see or hear english in written or spoken form, expect a heavy accent and grammatical or typographical errors. Proofreading or getting professional speakers would increase the value of Kimulator.The storyline is unbelievably weak. Characters are generic and easily forgettable.Communication between characters is reduced to next to nothing. Some joke here or there that I do not laugh about, some sentences that seek shocking value (e.g. ""I will kill you like a jew in the Holocaust, b*tch."" or ""Because I'm Jesus, Motherf*cker!"") and outdated internet jokes (e.g. the ever-so-loved ""I banged your mom""-line). The player gets told what to do, that's it. No exposition, no milestones. The rest is filled with repeated lines or badly edited ""action"" scenes of the protagonist trying to climb a building or shooting his gun in the fanciest way possible.There is no visual feedback of hitting enemies. Enemies ragdoll way too forcefully from being killed by pistol rounds, yet just slowly topple over like a falling Jenga™ tower when killed with a gunshot. Why that is, is beyond me.Here is some occasional math for your pleasure:Two Cutscenes + Credits á 7m 32s + 8m 10s = 15m 42s of cutscene playtime.Two instances of Gameplay á 4m and 2m max. = Maximum of 6m actual gameplay time (if you follow the objectives as fast as possible)That makes a whooping ~75% of the game NON-INTERACTABLE.As I said before, this should have been a movie put onto youtube where it seems like it would belong. Not only because of that, but because it would actually benefit the value of what could have been a mediocre product.Concluding ThoughtsKimulator is a game that I would never play again. As requested by the developer, BMC Studio, I gave my opinion on his first game. I see the wish that they could create a game that would made it onto the storefront through Greenlight. I see that they seek appreciation for what they created. This is obviously to be expected, but it seems like, BMC Studios did not solve this equation considering the quality of their game.While they completed their goal, (getting a game on Steam) one should consider what the ultimate outcome of their goal has brought them: Instead of delivering what I would consider a quality product, they produced a game that is only of less than mediocre, yes I would even say bad, quality. I don't think that this is what they seek to be known for.When BMC Studios would actually take some time, and by that I mean longer than half a year for instance, do some research on what Steam wants and needs, what Steam likes and dislikes and adapt accordingly, they could actually create what could be an above mediocre game I suppose. But what I see here is clearly not a well thought out product.Potential Buyers: Stay away. No not buy. Refund if bought. I am getting mine right after posting this."

,Not Recommended,475430,25084430,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,Monsieur-Owly,"While North Korea has been criticized for its authoritarian regime and human rights violation the same can be said about Steam Greenlight as most oversensitive indie devs with a huge ego will attempt to censor every review and comment that criticize their poorly made product. Such is the case of BMC Studio, a new company formerly made of French-Canadian teenagers that follow the footsteps of the infamous Digital Homicide Studios.To put it simple, Kimulator is the poor man's version of the abysmal Rogue Warrior: you play as a French-Canadian ""soldier"" sent to ""North Korea"" by Jesus to eliminate ""Kim Jong-Un"". The concept itself is not bad at all and is very reminiscent of B-movies. The problem lies in the execution: the game uses GameGuru engine, a game making tool that is just as horrible as FPS Creator. While I have no experience in game making I must admit that I have never seen anything good coming out from GameGuru and FPS Creator (ex: Into the Dark; Rober D. Anderson and the Legacy of Cthulhu; Moonbase 332; Sector; Elves Adventure).That being said, Kimulator is no different from any GameGuru and FPS Creator based product: very poor optimization, horrible level design, incoherent use of assets, bland shooting mechanics and unbalanced difficulty. Not to mention the very short length of the Story Mode (just 20 minutes!) and the fact that you don't really get to see Kim Jong-Un in the game (aside from the drawing on the main menu and loading screen that appears during the 10 first seconds of gameplay):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwv-XVUX890Rating:1.0 / 10"

It's a basic little arcade shooter that is similar to what you may expect to find on free flash game sites.+ The bonus platforming level with the Bunny had such a great and cheerful environment.- Far too many long loading screens.- The gameplay and environments were very primitive for a shooter.- The main character ""a random French Canadian"" does not speak English fluently, so a lot of his lines are hard to understand or honestly just make him sound like an idiot. ( If English is not their native language, they should have just spoke in French and used subtitles..)- The whole cast of characters and story has a ton of problems. One guy apparently did not like his voice, so he lip-synced to someone elses voice. It seemed like they just edited in footage of whoever played ""Jesus"" as he was never actually in the scene with the others. Kim Jong Un was sadly never shown. I mean honestly it's just two guys playing around in a school yard pretending they are in North Korea... really bad production quality.- The story honestly sucks. Basically, it's about a guy who is told to go to North Korea and kill Kim Jong Un otherwise his family will be killed. Jesus teleports the guy from Canada to North Korea to kill Kim, and then Jesus takes over North Korea. That's about it..."

,Not Recommended,475430,24910958,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"I usually structure my reviews properly, with a solid introduction and laid out in a pretty well written fashion. Today, I'm not going to bother with that, since honestly there's not much to say about BMC Studio other than they're comprised of a few grade school age French Canadian guys. Kimulator: Fight For Your Destiny is undoubtedly their end-of-year school project, or perhaps I'm misjudging their ages and it's their entry level Year One college project. Either way, even having gone in to this ""game"" with an open mind ready for comedy, laughs, and overall silliness, this is a terrible title.What sold me on this game primarily was the thought of supporting some French Canadians. I live in Canada myself, and I enjoy regular trips to Montreal for metal concerts. I have friends in Montreal, it's a beautiful city. And, tabarnak, I love to curse in Canadian French because it's all blasphemies against the church. For $1.33 CAD I figured I could help an indie team from my country buy a good ol' Tim Horton's coffee, at least. To be honest, these reasons are the only ones that I'm not hitting the refund button.Kimulator: Fight For Your Destiny has a simple plot; kill the leader of North Korea. You're accompanied by Jesus, câlisse baptême, who helps guide you on your quest. Of the main game, 98% of it is all live action cutscenes while there are only two small first-person shooter sections where you don't have to kill anyone at all. The enemy AI is terrible, and unless you get close to them, they don't bother to fire at you. The live action sequences primarily consist of one lanky guy in a red Canada sweater. To be very honest, I didn't laugh once at any of this even though I was really hoping for a game that would make me at least chuckle. It's akin to watching a very embarrassing grade school project, which in all probability is what this is; just a bunch of guys screwing around, not even caring if what they're doing turns out well or not.Surprisingly, the optimization of this title is decent enough. However, in my experience most of the textures loaded as pure black; trees, the building, enemies, guns. The game for me looked nothing like it did in the screenshots on the store page, at least when it came to actual game play. You do have a HUD, which features how many health points and ammo that you have left. After going a while without getting hit, your health will also replenish. Aside from the story mode, there's also a practice mode, and some bonus missions to tackle... which I didn't. I also didn't bother with Dreamblaster which is the ""bonus game"".I think the thing that ticked me off the most about Kimulator: Fight For Your Destiny was the end game plea for ""positive ratings"". This came up not once, but twice. Sacrament viarge maudit... don't beg for positive reviews mauzus. Anyway... just avoid this obvious no-cost school project that was probably funded on to Steam by these guys' parents. It's not funny, and the story barely even makes any sense. Good luck in the future dudes, maybe one of you will make it to Ubisoft Montreal sometime.Rating:1.0/5.0- It's Bad.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

They masked their micro-holocaust abomination by calling it a game and making a sad attempt at passing it off as humor.Human kind is still trying to recover from the shockwave of pain and agony brought about by this game, and the creators, BMC Studio, are still to this day being hunted down for their crimes against humanity."
,Not Recommended,475430,33832714,Posted: 27 July,all,crawfish pie,"I feel like they tried to make this game interesting, but it's really just a couple of short, somewhat amusing videos with an extremely infuriating super buggy, awfully laggy game engine surrounding it. The loading screens take forever. If you wound up buying this game in a sale like I did and have this one on your backlog, don't bother playing. Just go dig in the folder for the video files and watch them if you think you'll get any entertainment value out of this. You can probably get the gist of the story from those.Side note: I have not done this. And I have not played through the game. The intro video that interrupts your movement to show you how to save turned me pretty far off. But I still wound up giving the weird bunny platformer a try. The bunny fell off the bridge and didn't die and there was no way to get out of the water. So f that, I just left the game running to farm steam cards, I'm writing this bad review while I wait for that to finish, and I'm planning to uninstall after the cards come in.It's just not good.

,Not Recommended,475430,29147958,Posted: 9 January,all,Kintha,"My Kimulator ReviewWhat is Kimulator?Kimulator(or Kim jong un simulator) as previously known is a game in which you play as a french canadian 'guy' who is forced to kill kim jong un by the commander of the canadian army. As you may not have expected this is a FPS 'Comedy' Game made on Gameguru rather than a management game based upon the Kim jong un.The 'comedy' in this game constitutes of cringy and poor quality videos of 2 kids who have filmed videos in the middle of a housing estate and (likely) the school they attend the acting featured in these videos is poor at best and the quality of these videos are comparable to a 12 year olds first youtube/home video this is shown during the more serious moments in the plot such as the video where the main character is detained he is laughing. Most of the props used in these videos are most likely from discount shops such as dollartree such as the army helmet and the guns featured, second of all some of the videos used in game also show that the school they film in is both canada and north korea which is contradictive to the plot as well using local locations in their area such as an ikea store.Furthermore it isn't just limited to the acting of the 2 main characters the jesus videos which are used although the acting of jesus is of a professional actor on fiverr whilst he is good at acting this video show that although the script he is given shows that this game is poor.Is This Game Fun?I personally feel that the game isn't fun as the game is just an asset flip with the engine of the game being gameguru and using the multiple assets that the game engine gives you with no new content made.The story mode is short and contradictive and the other modes being featured in the game are shallow,short and are more often than not incoherent.How Long Is This Game?This game can be completed within 10 minutes including viewing the 'Comedy' Videos included in the game.There is 5 modes I played on 2 of these being generic levels of a fantasy and zombie setting the 3 other modes are particularly abysmal these being a tutorial mode where you use the random array of weapons used in game such as a a halberd and a sci fi style gun that resembles a gun from unreal or a timesplitters game and randomly spawning enemies that are just a collection of assets such as zombies,fantasy characters that overall make no coherent sense in the level. Another mode present is a modern day level where someone is singing(if you want to call it that) a terrible rendition of the jurassic park theme song in which you shoot terrorists.Finally the last mode mode where you play as the easter bunny collecting coins(which is a bit odd when he has a basket with easter eggs in the basket.) and in this mode there is 2 levels the first one being coherent until you face a rabbit that has a laser gun and then from there the mode quickly goes south with the last level having you run from the random collection of assets from the tutorial this game is also very easy to beat as you don't have to collect all the coins and you just have to run the linear path that the game has for you and when you face the characters such as the evil rabbits and the other assets, your character also has regeneration powers(like wolverine from the x-men comics.) so even if you get shot at multiple times you can just regenerate your health in seconds.Who Would I Recommend This For?Being personally honest I wouldn't recommend this game at all even at the sale price because if you have spend the money there are better games avaliable at the same price such as yet another zombie defence which is significantly better and longer than this game. The only time you should even think about having this game is if someone on your steam friends list gives you this as a joke present and that is only to farm the cards DO NOT EVER BUY THIS GAME."

He is given the task to kill Kim Jong Un, by the canadian army's commander. Jesus Christ comes into contact with our hero, and says he will help him defeat the north koreans. In exchange for command of the country. After you go through some FPS action sequences that really push the bar. You climb your way to the north korean HQ roof top, you are placed in a death match with Kim Jong Un and his cohorts. Upon defeating them and reaching the end of the rooftop. You are greeted with a long cinematic cutscene. The country is in Jesus's hands now. He claims that he will end world hunger and care for his people. However he reveals that is not the pure intention of his actions, he really is going to have a rave party with Elvis and Michael Jackson in heaven. The canadian army commander shoots our hero in the head. Here we see a major continuity error. After being shot in the head he is seen clutching his stomach. Error aside this game is amazing, i would totally reccomend it to any FPS lover. Or a lover of story telling in general. The only problem i have with this game is....1 The load time is ridiculous but it is understandable for what you are greeted with.2 The acne scarred child who invades the screen and shows you how to save your game is extremely annoying. Because he will always do this even if you've beaten the game already.3 At the final battle i couldn't tell which player model was Kim Jong Un because they just use random♥♥♥♥♥character presets like a viking, or a rabbit.4 The weapons barely function.5 The futuristic shotgun rapes my ears when i reload it.6 The 20 minutes of credits that you cannot skip.I would reccomend this game as a good example of how to make a game."

The actors were elaborite, putting everything they could in both the acting and voice acting in the gameplay. Talking about the gameplay, I have to say that this game wasn't a 10/10. The core gameplay seemed flawed, while some small incorrectnessess in the logic that were enough to put me off for the rest of the game.

Not all people will appreciate the style that the creators have gone with, I must admit it is an odd choice - during the gameplay the graphics give the game a much missed play station 1 feel but during the cutscenes the graphics look very life-like. It is refreshing to see developers try something unique.Gameplay:Whilst playing you will mostly spend your time killing Kim Jong Un's soldiers, the gunplay can be compared to that of CS:GO but I would say it is above that. There is a large selection of weapons to experiment with, my favourite being the futuristic pistol that looks as if it was made in paint (an artistic choice im sure). Within the game you have the option to play several game modes including the story mode, the game boasts impressive 45 minute - hour long campaign, filled with exitement, romance and action. In my opinion the game really shines when you start playing the ""bonus"" levels. I wont spoil them for you, but my personal favourite mini-game was the one where you walk in this giant field surrounded by mountains, all whilst being chased by these eggs with faces and bunnies. It seems to be impossible to complete this minigame but im sure that is just an artistic choice, to really make the player sympathize with the character.Story: *Warning spoilers for this section*The main story of the game is centered around the main protagonist who is attempting to kill the dictator of North Korea, he is forced into this act of heroism by the general, the general is a complex character to say the least, his voice is often heard throughout the game through a mobile phone as well as at the main menu the same actor who plays the general explains to the player what to do. As mentioned earlier the campaign last around 45 min. - hour depending on how you play and ""if you ah know theee um, fps genre"" as said by Alan (Alan plays the general), the campaign ends with our protagonist killing Kim Jong Un. My personal theory around the game is that you are actually playing as a person who has had large portions of theyre brain removed, this would explain the graphics choices as well as some of the strange mechanics, for example the sniper rifle/marksman rifle only fires a bullet if you use the scope, another example being the large lack of recoil when ADS (aim down sight), the main charcter also sometimes speaks with ""Jesus"" or believes that he has been teleported, so perhaps the main character is just delusional.**No spoilers past this point**Strong points (of the game):- Compeling storyline- intense gameplay- fun mechanics- good relatively steady fps- a large variety of weaponsWeak points:- This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥Overall I would give this game a score of 9.8 / 10This is because of its fantastic story and strong selection of minigames."

Like, it's a gag game guys, it's 1 big meme. Like look at bad rats, that game is atrocious but it still has a ton of joke reviews because it's so bad it's good. Same with this game like god damn I don't think I've laughed so while playing a game in years. The cutscenes are pure gold because of the fact that it was made like a 2008 nigahiga video. The developer(s?) made this game with literally 1 goal in mind and that was to get this glorious thing on steam. They're not trying to make the next great indie title.

The game incorportates all sorts of new ideas and gameplay that no man has ever put to the screen. This game is full of heart and understanding. The story of the game is the most orginal story I've ever seen. It starts out with our main protaginist who is a French Canadain who is on a quest to defeat the evil Kim  Jon UN. We see his character go through an arc that is beautifully handcrafted by the writers of this game. He and Jesus form a bond that cannot be broken and they set out on a quest that is lifechanging. Never in my life have i seen a game that twists time and reality in order to make a compelling story with characters that YOU care about. This game not only offers an amazing campaign but also offers a mulitplayer mode, a free copy of dreamblaster, fps training, and a bonus game.
