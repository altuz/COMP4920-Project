,Recommended,476240,28930023,Posted: 1 January,all,¡★Zerafalgar,"Gameplay:How to play the game:Very simple, anyone who's ever liked playing chess will definitely learn how this game is played instantly. The game is about moving red and blue knights over boards of chess to red/blue highlighted tiles, as in a game of chess, knights can only move in L-shaped direction (2 tiles straight and then 1 tile to side), the knights can jump over whatever it's standing in their way, as long as the tile they're meant to go to is empty. To clear a level, every red knight has to stand in a red tile, as well as every blue knight in blue tile (the easiest  levels only contain knights of 1 color).What to expect of the base game (level packs and levels):There are 82 levels in the base part of the game total divided into 5 level packs - the pawn pack, the rook pack, the bishop pack, the queen pack and the king pack. With pawn being easiest to king being hardest, resembling to value of the chess figures (rook is easier than bishop). Why exactly 82 levels? It's rather simple, allow me to explain: Pawn pack is the easiest, the board sizes in pawn pack are 3x3 tiles, so 9 tiles total, there are 9 levels in the pawn pack. Rook is on 4x3 tile sized boards, meaning there are 12 tiles and levels. Bishop is 4x4 (16 levels), queen is 5x4 (20 levels) and king is 5x5 (25 levels).If you struggle with one specific level, you can always skip it and return to it later or not return to it at all, as unlocking new pack doesn't require you to complete all levels in the pack you are in, only most of the levels in a pack have to be completed in order to unlock a next one.Additional information about the levels:But of course, to make every one of the levels unique and more and more challenging as the game gets harder, most of the levels have some tiles on the board blocked, meaning no knight figure can access them. Even later in the game (starting from queen pack), there will also be yellow knights. It doesn't matter where yellow knights stand at all. They are there just to make the game harder for you by blocking the red and blue knights resulting in more trouble of getting them to the highlighted tiles. Of course you can move the yellow knights, but also only in the L-shaped ways. You can reset and exit any level at any time, everything auto-saves.Daily levels:The game has also a feature that automatically generates completely random 75 levels you can play everyday, divided into 3 25-level packs. Pack A, B and C. Those packs reset daily and have no influence on the main packs that are the same forever.Motivational words:Upon pausing the game or finishing any of the main packs, you are given motivational texts, being reminded how capable you are, really nice little addition to the game.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Game's design:Before launching the game, you'll see a small options window allowing you to set the graphic settings, the resolution of the game, and whether you want the game to be windowed or not. Even on the highest graphic settings and resolution, the game design is still so simple that every computer/laptop without exception could run it.The music was great to the theme of the game. Simple and calming.Overall the way the game looks is just the way a puzzle game like KNIGHTS should look like in my opinion.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary of pros & cons:Pros:-Great and challenging puzzles, over 3 hours of fun in levels of various difficulties-Easy to run on any PC-Nice base price of 0.99€, discounted to 0.49€ during sales-Very easy to understand-Ideal for people of all ages, from children to elders-Great atmosphere of the game, relaxing music and fitting graphics-Almost endless, considering there are 75 new levels automatically generated every day-Great motivational textsCons:-Being a simple puzzle game could also make the game repetitive and boring for some people----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final words:I did not know what to expect of the game when I've been buying it for the discounted price of 0.49€, but after starting it, I could almost instantly tell the game is great. I got more addicted to it than I would expect and even though I'm generally not a big fan of puzzle games, I really couldn't help myself but to leave this one a positive review. Definitely worth buying even its full price, though waiting for a 50% discount can always work too. Since the game also drops trading cards, big % of the game's price will still return to you through selling the trading cards, even though the game itself is already pretty cheap. If you are a big fan of puzzle games, I'd suggest to give KNIGHTS a shot as soon as you're able to, I am pretty sure you won't regret it.This is my second serious game review I've written on steam. Took over an hour to do. Leaving any feedback in the comments would be appreciated. Thank you for reading!"

Usually with cheap puzzle games they are short and once you finish them there is no replayablity factor.  Here, with the addition of daily puzzles - 3  new sets of 25 boards/levels every day, it's unending and you certainly get your money's worth out of it.  In main game, there are 5 sets of puzzles, each set of varying amount - 82 boards in total.  The first 3 sets are very easy.If you don't random click your way through the easy beginning sets but make sure you work it out, then it will greatly help you with the King and daily levels and get you used to patterns.  This puzzle game has nothing to do with chess (apart from how the knight moves) but I would say you do have to be able to think ahead at least 2-3 moves - actually backward from the solution.It's a pick it up just do one board type game which is great but I wish you could save mid way through a board.  I did find most dailies to be a bit harder than the King pack.  For achievement hunters, wanting the quickest/easiest route - some daily level tips -- Don't even try and do a daily pack, know you are going to play this over a few days.- Some days just seem quite a bit easier than others.- On each day in each of 3 pack I found 3-5 boards that were about King level.- Sometimes A1 etc boards are the easiest but not always.- Only play boards that have 3 spare spaces in them - ignore the two space ones, I found having  space to move around easier.If you love work it out puzzles, no timer just point n click then I do recommend this really fun game.  I loved it."

,Recommended,476240,30749837,Posted: 26 March,all,Dark Blue Monkey,"Oh. My. God.   I just finished Knights, and my brain hurts. It really does.   I don't get much time to play games, so I have to cram everything at the weekend.   Thinking in ""L"" shaped patterns, and working out chains of moves is NOT my forte!  Let's just get it out there: I suck at chess.  I really do.  I once put a chess computer on ""zero ply"" (which is AI-speak for 'don't be clever, just move random pieces to places they can go), and I still didn't manage to win.So, a game which is all about trying to put pieces in a specific location is supremely brain-busting for me.    Nevertheless, I persevered through, and managed to finish the main game.The game is split into five 'levels', and each level has between 9 and 30 'boards'.. Each board is set up so that you have to move knight chess pieces around in order to put the red or blue knights back onto their red or blue squares.   Sounds easy?  Well, to begin with,  it is :)Pretty soon, bit of the board become un-usable, and then there are yellow knights whose sole purpose is to get in the way.   Once the little yellow b*****ds turn up, the game starts to turn into a really brain-bending challenge, because you often have to move a bunch of yellows out of the way, in a specific chain in order to get your coloured knight into the right spot.As the game continues, you start to 'see' patterns.  There are ways to get your knight from one spot to another spot at a relative position away.  There are some hard moves (moving immediately next door) and easy ones (moving two squares away, or to your diagonal neighbour )..   Once you start to see the patterns, the game starts to flow a little better, and all of a sudden you begin to 'see' the chains of moves you need to make, and before long you're planning ahead to get the knight where you want it to be.   I guess it's sort of like a kingergarten level sense of 'ply' that real chess players have when they can scan the board, and plot a number of moves in advance.However, chess masters can simulate the moves in their heads, which normos like me can't so the game really helps by allowing you to 'see' the valid target jumps for a knight by clicking on it, and doing chains is easy because you can just keep clicking the place you want to move it to.  moving back and forth incurs no penalties, so you can move things about all over the place.    One of the most frustrating things is that the boards can be set up so that specific knights have to be in place before you tackle others.  It's vitally important in the later levels that you nail those first, or you're just going to spin for ages, moving one piece all over the shop.I'd say my experience to begin with was very impressed by the way you could 'milk' a game out of one chess piece.  This turned into being impressed by the way the board managed to be set up in increasing ways.  This turned into being impressed by how the boards are set up beautifully, but are, indeed, solvable, when they REALLY shouldn't be.   This then turned into dogged determinism to get the darned game finished.   Yes, I have to admit, midway through the 'queen' level, I started to really struggle.  I'd say the estimated time to complete a board started out at about 10 seconds, and midway through 'queen' ended up being a solid 10 to 15 minutes.   Strangely,  by the end of queen, I'd really started to get back into whatever flow you need, and the king level was relatively easy compared to queen.Once you get to (say) Queen level, you are well-enough armed to tackle the Daily puzzles.  Like Lyne, Race the sun,  and a few other indie puzzlers, the daily puzzles are all procedurally generated.  The first one I tried was solved in two clicks.  The next one had be beat.  The difficulty level is all over the place, because the computer doesn't know what makes a level hard for a human.  What's really impressive is that the designers have figured out how to make boards procedurally generate that are still solvable!I really enjoyed this game, and despite my frustration in 'queen', I think it's well worth a play if you like logic and puzzle problems:  Especially if you like chess, or just like indie puzzlers like Lyne."

Now you have to move in different sized boards (3x3-5x5) upto 2 colored knights on the fitting colored fields by making only knight moves. Ofc there are obstacles like golden placeholder knights and unaccessable fields. The logic is deep if you beat all the standard packs upto king levels. After that the challenge even raises because all daily generated puzzles are also or above king level niveau. So it takes a few hours to beat the standard packs but even more hours to beat 25 daily puzzles. Fun but also challenging."

Neither issue harms the game significantly but they contribute to occasionally making it a little more trial and error than I personally like.

The game is very good for its style and its puzzles. The game also has a lot of replay value.Knights is in a chess style, with the only pieces being knights that you move, this style is accompanied by a chessboard that the pieces lay on. The knights thus move in the same way they do in chess, this is a very good game mechanic, as it gives you something you are familier with, such as a chess knight, and making you use it differently, as in these puzzles. This use of only the knight is interesting, as it is the only piece in chess that can jump over blocked pieces, as it moves the strangest out of all the pieces, thus giving it a special interest.The puzzles in Knights are very fun, and challenging, you have to move the red knights into the red spaces, and the blue knights into the blue spaces, which is easy at first, but it ends up getting challenging quickley (as this is a bloody video game!), and you need to find new ways to move pieces around to achieve the end goal. Eventually more obstcles are introduced, such as blocked spaces, and outcast knights (with no space to go, so they end up getting in the way).Knights has a system that is not unlike Lyne's, where you unlock daily puzzles. These daily puzzles help to provide much more replay value. If you finish the main puzzles, you can just play the daily puzzles. The only problem I have encountered with the daily puzzles thus far is that, because they are randomly generated, they will sometimes be generated solved. I am unaware if I have come across an impossible puzzle, as it's hard to tell if my failure is from a lack of skill or the lack of solvability. A massive pro to having daily puzzles is if a puzzle is too hard, you can always wait till tomorrow to get a puzzle matching your skill level, and you are not unable to progress.Overall Knights is a very well made game, if you enjoy puzzle games like Lyne, Knights is a great choice, or even if you love a game of chess, Knights will be a familier friend. The puzzles are quite addictive, once you get the hang of it, and the daily puzzles give you a reason to not uninstall it after completing."
,Recommended,476240,31804096,Posted: 17 May,all,Dohi64,"even though I'm not into chess, I had a good time playing knights. there's not much to it, you can only move the pieces like you would if you were playing chess, but you only have different colored knights here that you have to move around until they end up where they should be, blue ones on a square with a blue silhouette, red ones on a red. yellow figures are just there to cause you pain and block your movement but they can also be moved around.there are 82 levels, and while initially I was just clicking randomly until the level was done, after a while I had to do some thinking, several steps ahead, and while some levels gave me a real headache, they were really satisfying to solve. the game also generates 3 sets of daily levels (75 every day), which should provide plenty of playtime if you want more.I only had 2 minor technical issues with the game, one was clearly because of my ancient hardware, though I don't think starting the game should take this long even on my pc.  and even though I muted the audio after a while, sometimes the game still started with audio turned on.I recommend checking out the game even if you don't like chess, like myself. at this price you can't really go wrong with it if you enjoy puzzle games."

It creates a very relaxed gameplay environment. That may be where the similarities end though, as the puzzles themselves I find to be much more challenging than anything in LYNE... KNIGHTS is certainly a 'simplistic' puzzle game, but it is by no means 'easy'. The game's normal singleplayer challenges start you off slow and allow you to grasp the mechanics, then steadily works you towards wanting to pull our your hair. The final stretch of stages are certainly a challenge, but they are managable. Once you've completed the game, there are Daily Challenges that add indefinite replayability... LYNE has a similar format, but in the case of KNIGHTS I quickly found myself giving up on attempting to complete any of the daily challenges, as they are ALL seemingly set at the King Level of difficulty and passing even the first stage in a daily set feels nearly impossible. Was enjoyable on the whole though."

Even as the difficulty increases, new concepts are introduced in simplified stages before raising difficulty.Ambience -particularly the music- is excellent and counter-balances the more frustrating moments of the game. Great for relaxing while still feeling accomplished.Some minor nitpicks where the game could be improved:- An option to turn off the ""available moves"" for each piece. Especially in the early levels, it made the game feel too easy and made any slowdown more frustrating -- at least for me.- Multiple options for piece colors/background colors.

After this paragraph or so of text, you're going to scroll upwards, buy this game, and enjoy your life.Just do it.What is this thing you call a ""Chess""?KNIGHTS is a game about, you guessed it, moving knight pieces on little checkered puzzle boards. Do you need to know jack about chess? Not really, but it helps if you've played a few casual games, just so you're familiar with a Knight's moves, since it's definitely the least intuitive of the pieces. But, even if you've never played a game of chess in your life, this game indicates quite clearly which spaces you can and can't move to.But is it any good though?KNIGHTS takes the mechanics of moving a knight chess piece, and builds a fantastic little puzzler around it. Your task is to move knights to certain preallocated positions, which gradually becomes more and more complex as your chessboard shrinks, and the number of pieces increases. You can do this by just brute-force clicking at everything you can until it works, which is only viable for the earlier puzzles, or carefully try to map out how you want things to look like X moves from now, and work backwards. At the point I'm at, about 2 hours in, I'd go crazy if I even attempted to brute-force these monsters...The game also apparently has dailies, which I haven't looked at too much so far. These might have varying difficulties day to day (the was Duet does it), or  just a set difficulty. I'll update this review on my thoughts on dailies once I give them a look. At a glance, though, just that should be enough to add a good number of hours to your time with this game.What can you even buy with a dollar anymore in America?Really, it's just a fun and cue little puzzle game for a dollar.

Many of the levels feel like work. You are plotting how to move several pieces with few degrees of freedom. This is not brain dead fun. These are actual puzzles of spatial manipulation."

When it goes off of sale, I might buy a few copies for my puzzle loving friends.If you're a fan of chess or puzzles, KNIGHTS is a definite purchase. Its beautiful, enchanting music and minimalistic design will lure you in instantly. The puzzles start (in my opinion, in each pack) relatively easy, but progressively get harder and harder as the packs continue. In addition, there are daily puzzles (once you unlock them) which shows that the developers are constantly updating the game. I've also noticed them responding to customers' desires in the community boards, and making very good updates to the game.Overall, this game is pretty well done, and I look forward to more games made by this company. 10/10!I feel like this game would be fit for a mobile platform (iOS/Android), so if the developers read these reviews- I would love to see a mobile version as well! :)"

At that point, you've pretty much seen all the game has to offer and figured out the strategy, so you can put it aside. (Total gameplay was about 7 hours for me.)The game fundamentally involves a lot of clicking around and trial and error, but it's still not easy. If you just click arbitrarily, you may solve earlier puzzles, but you won't be able to solve later ones. You need a more systematic approach."

If you don't have a love of puzzles and/or chess and even if you do, you still might not like the game. Reasoning, the game starts out pretty simple and most of the puzzles are easy. The player can plot out there moves and solve the puzzle. Later on the game becomes complicated enough that it is impossible to do this and you can find yourself randomly moving pieces until you find the correct solution. Or as it came down for me, I would work on getting one knight into his proper spot and then moving on to the next knight. Doing so makes the game lose some of the puzzle discovery lose its edge (feels more like chance). The game is kind of extremely short as far as the regular puzzles go. There are daily levels once you reach a certain point which is nice, but all in all I'm going to give this the thumbs down. Hopefully this review helps in understanding what the game is like and you can decide if you like the game or not."

The layout of the background together with the transitions from a menu to another (or level to level) is super awkward for the eye and creates a really unpleasent effect. As dumb as it sounds, you are constantly changing levels in the game and so it becomes tiresome and hardly bearable really fast, because of this, I cannot recommend it."

Achievements are made in such a way that you are not forced to repeat everything over and over again to get them all. On a discount it could be nice. If you like solitare then this will be something new and so much harder to do ;) Just do not solve too many at once. I am done with the achievements and there is no good reason to look at it ever again so be warned.

I happen to like these types of games so that first part didn't apply to me. If this disclaimer doesn't apply to you then feel free to read onwards!Wow! What a fantastic game! I absolutely loved this game for the idea of the game and how well it was executed. I've got a lot more to say about it, but I'll run through a list of the pros and cons of the game first.Pros:- Low PriceFor only 1 dollar off sale and even less when it’s on sale, this game is quite worth it! Imo it could be a little bit more on the shop and I still would have bought it!- Fantastic IdeaI've loved the puzzles that deal with the knight piece from Chess for the longest time, but the idea of putting a bunch of them on a chessboard and then working puzzles around them was also awesome. It was especially rewarding that one of the achievements led to you thinking a little bit outside the box on a certain level as well.- Infinite replayingEven though I'm not really sure how it works, it seems that there are 75 new puzzles generated for the game for each different day! I didn't play through a whole bunch of them but I did notice the changes between the different days, and (bonus!) the puzzles are still quite challenging.- Colorblind modeI feel that a lot of games of this type don't give too much thought to the colorblind players of the game, but I really enjoy that this dev took the time to make a separate colour palette so that everyone could enjoy the game.Cons:- Lack of ""saving""The only real problem that I had with this game is that there wasn't any way to save the progress that you made with a given level. It was a little bit annoying knowing that if you started a level you were stuck there and had to finish it up before you could step away again (otherwise you'd lose all progress).Overall, I'd say the execution, idea, and time that were put into making this game make it a fantastic buy and the low price makes it that much better in the end. If you can get it on sale, that's cool but it's worth it even if it isn't! Overall, a solid 9.5/10 and like I said if there was ""save mechanic"" this game would have gotten a 10/10 from me!"
,Recommended,476240,32988988,Posted: 29 June,all,Dr16N1K4,"Knights has a simple premise: move the chess knight into the appropriate colored square. What it lacks in variety of mechanics, it more than makes up for with its challenging puzzles. The main game itself doesn't have a lot of puzzles, but there are new randomly-generated daily puzzles that essentially answer for the game's replay value. Worth picking up if you're into puzzle games."

,Recommended,476240,34094104,Posted: 7 August,all,Croof046,"Knights is a simple relaxing puzzler based on the classic movement of the Knight chess piece. Designated pieces must be moved about the board methodically to their matching colored spaces. There are several puzzle packs which ramp up in size and difficulty, as well as the ability to unlock daily procedurally generated levels as you progress through the game. The puzzles are all logically solvable, and in the King pack in particular, random movements to attempt a solve will generally not yield the desired fruit. As the game is based upon a single concept I found it easier to play in short bursts, rather than try to solve 100+ similar puzzles one after another. My only complaint is that of a sore neck as I found myself inadvertantly angling my head 45 degrees to give a more traditional perspective of the puzzle board."
