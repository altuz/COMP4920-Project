,Not Recommended,476360,33709079,Posted: 21 July,all,Lindus,"To owners of the original, this is the same game as Strike Vector, it's just repackaged for consoles. The maps, weapons, specials, ship customization, etc. are all the same, besides LMG being removed and vector painting highly simplified.They gave it a clunky console interfact and reduced loadout complexity by letting you only wield one weapon instead of two. They also made collisions in jet mode much more sympathetic. These changes are presumably to make the game easier to control on the console release but they lower the depth and skill ceiling. The interior view of the cockpit in first person mode was also removed for some reason. Besides balance tweaks, the only other changes are adding 64bit support, bots and ranked matchmaking.Why are they selling it as a new game? It doesn't amount to anything more than a (bad) patch. Something they stopped releasing for the original less than a year after release. Most obnoxiously, the menu options all have Xbox controller commands listed instead of keyboard controls with no way to switch it. If this was packaged as a new release with the intention to sell on consoles, then decision to list it on Steam as a new game, as opposed to an update, was just a scummy cash grab.I had thought it was a shame they never released Strike Vector as freeware (or implement LAN sharing) after it was abandoned, so a long lasting community could be allowed to exist around the otherwise dead game. It seems they were holding out to try and milk the corpse. The game is still good, despite the casualization, and an artifact of the re-release is that people are online again, so paying $12 for your patch might be worth it just to play again (the 50% off deal for owners of the original has ended)."

I bought this game the moment it came out with high hopes.I figured it was cheap enough right? They can't have done much, but that's ok. Maybe we'll finally see some people online the servers.Instead I get the controls switched, an xbox controller UI, a dissapointing story mode, and more bots than TF2 hat farming back in the day.I SO badly want to recommend this game like I did the first one. I really wanted EX to bring this game back to life. Instead it's just slightly reskinned with no improvement to the sad multiplayer that killed this game.This game is honestly one of my favorites. The design, the music, the gameplay, it's ALL there. It's like a pizza you just ordered, hot, fresh, and with all your favorite ingredients, but your delivery man drove to your house riding on a jackhammer, and everything inside the box is ruined.Fool me once, shame on you, Ragequit. Fool me twice, shame on me."

Nothing special.No pay2win or pay2look-better-than-you market. Classic, clean, no strings attached multiplayer game like from 2005.Loaded with bot players right now because the community is still growing. Jumping on board will help immensely with this problem.Base price is fair for what it offers. Any sale that brings it below $10 is definetly worth it."

Online is still dead - which isn't an issue for me.Cause I'll happily pay to play against bots! Which is why I bought it.(I give 0 fcks about campaign tho - this is a multiplayer shooter first and that's where it should focus)But then I saw that offline bots is limited to skirmish mode - which includes 3 difficulty settings, map selection and 1 game mode. That's where I draw the line. As much as I want to, I'm not dropping 6 for that little contentYou can't set the player count, or the game mode? Where's the survival horde mode? Where's dueling 1v1? Or all the other game modes? (CTF was so much fun)You'd think a dead multiplayer game would focus on it's offline content.You'd think SVEX would take advantage of it's new and (pretty awesome, challenging) designed botsBut it doesn't. What we get is bare minimum as far as offline gameplay goes. A solid campaign and 1 mode offlineIf you're buying this for the bots, and you can only play 1 very basic mode against the bots...It's a damn shame because this gameplay is a huge gem if I've ever seen one. I'd easily drop $20 or more for a full fleshed out game. This concept really deserves it.The fact that it removes one of the bigger gameplay elements of the 1st game (duel wielding) is just icing on the cake.And serves as a reminder of the ""dumb down"" streamlining to appeal to consoles. Sucks that SVEX went that route but oh well, it's not a deal-breaker. But gameplay options are never a bad thing in a game with this little content."

,Recommended,476360,33663212,Posted: 19 July,all,Blindlight,"SVEX is a reworked and expanded version of Strike Vector in the unreal 4 engine. Should you pick up this ""new"" game?I think so, because there is simply NOTHING like Strike Vector out there right now. Flying Mech / 6DOF/ Space Shooter / Jet combat junkies get attracted to this game, but its actually more like Quake style FPS in space, highly maneuverable super fast paced and better played with a mouse and keyboard. As a cult game, you just have to allow some of its quirks and glitches and experience it for what it is. I think it's a must play even for owners of the first SV and I really hope to enjoy some renewed multiplayer activity. Make sure to join the community discord channel!https://discord.gg/xaBcVQlonger review below:I'm an owner of the original strike vector who tested the SVEX open beta and then bought the game at the 50% temporary discount for owners of the original.Here are some of the pros and cons of SVEX as a revised and updated version of the original game. Overall I think this game is worth the purchase even for owners of the original who might have preferred EX as a free upgrade instead of a 5.99 discounted new product.First, here are the main positive differences between SV and SVEX:+ rebuilt on Unreal Engine 4 (previously UE3) fpr PS4 and now ported to PC (yes it's a ""port"" with tweaks, more on that below)+ new solo campaign with a story and voice acted characters (pretty short but fun and cheesy like a dreamcast era action arcade game vibe. also each mission is timed so there is replay value to speedrun them)+ reworked (simplified) gameplay mechanics. Most notably: Weapon loadouts are the same for left and right guns, and they fire together.  It's much harder to die from crashing into walls than the original but still possible(a major reason newbies gave up on the original), speed boost rings also no longer have a crash-able surface around them. Finally theres some additional control options such as the ability to hold a key to trigger fast mode, which makes things feel WAY more fluid on its own.+ AI Players integrated seamlessly into multiplayer. Lack of bots was a big reason why the first SV died, and now they populate empty servers automatically and get replaced as real players join. you can also play practice skirmishes against bots for those who arent interested in multiplayer. They are pretty well done and the higher level AI can be a nice challenge.+ new multiplayer maps (theyre in the works if not currently available)+ steam achievements+ new crosshairs (small detail, but made a big difference in comfort for me to have a + reticle instead of a circle).there are a lot of other design changes not mentioned here too.Now some cons of SVEX:- it's a console port, so some console port woes exist. notably: netcode built for 60fps (can be unlocked  but with possible glitches in multiplayer. 144fps feels great otherwise); interface is designed for console so youll see console button prompts alongside keys; in first person mode the weapon models are cut off too soon at higher FOVs (hopefully theyll add an option to turn weapon models off).- it's NOT a sequel. Make no mistake this is an expanded form of the original game. Whether you think it's worth the price as an owner of the original is up to you. If you havent played the original, definitely get this version as it's got much more content. The only reason to play the old version would be to retain some of the details of the game mechanics that made it particularly brutally hard.- Until people set up more dedicated servers, many of the multiplayer servers are P2P which among other things means that when the host leaves the server gets shut down. Hopefully more dedis will get put up soon, since right now when the host ragequits, everyone gets kicked"

Awesome experience!Don't think about - buy it now!For those who already had strike vector original:Game now got the campaign mode with some storytelling which happens across arenas, which is kinda neat, it's not as straightforward as you would expect, it got some plot twists and interesting reveals, but in genereal it's here to give you some reason to PURGE everything on the arenas, and it's kinda cool, i enjoyed the story quite much!Also legendary players like Tzerox are back, and ah boy he managed to set top records for all missions in just a few hours after the game release, looking forward to dogfight with this monster again!If you are not convinced and think that the game may be way too fast for you, i'd say buy it no matter what unless you have a motion sickness, the game is not as much about fast reaction, but more of thinking clear, if you can do that - you can be really competative if you want, and only sky is the limittl;drBest game i ever played in last 10-15 years, buy itJUST DO IT"
,Recommended,476360,33671818,Posted: 20 July,all,LowCashBro,"Strike Vector was a hidden gem of a game, and this heavily updated new title is putting the shine back on it. Great graphical overhauls help keep the look and feel very modern and less cluttered than the previous title. Once dense ""troll or die"" weapon loadout combos have been smartle reduced and retooled. The controls are tight and accessible, in no time flat I was whipping through girders and dodging enemy fire like a gorramn anime protagonist.The story is a bit aimless at times, but charming. The cutscenes are well directed for their purposes, and the voice acting is pretty good. Nothing really stellar plot wise is blowing my mind 5 missions in, but I am going to probably try finishing it. It teaches mechanics well.MP wasn't empty either, I found a match fast on the server list but it seems to list frewer players than there are sometimes. Despite that it was a great pick up and play experience with the simplified and updated mechanics, and a lot of fun to play with people and alone.For the price of a decent entree at Applebee's you get to be a kickass vector jockey. Worth it."
76561197967967806,Recommended,476360,34346265,Posted: 19 August,all,Maxwell,"This is a review for the singleplayer bit only.It's ok. The short campaign mostly, or perhaps entirely takes place on recycled multiplayer maps. The combat is very much strike vector. There's a bunch of ingame cutscenes, which, given the setting, are basically just panning shots of a vector being voiced over. There's a few relic-style limited animation or panned still image cutscenes, which are tasteful. The game does not get much into the lore of the setting, which is certainly interesting to look at.The ending gives you a ""to be continued"", but I wouldn't really call it a cliffhanger, since by the end you'd more or less blown up everything you'd been shown over the course of the game.The singleplayer seems to be the tutorial for the multiplayer componet. Unfortunately, it rather strongly assumes you're playing with an xbox controller, and hardly throws any bones to m+kb users. Everything can be remapped, at least.For the price, though, it's fun enough. And the multiplayer is probably a blast."

,Recommended,476360,33764801,Posted: 24 July,all,Agent BLU,"This game makes quite an expansive addition to the original Strike Vector title that only featured online multiplayer, this time around , coupled with a campaign mode, plus offline skirmish to play against bots until you feel ready to jump into the meat grinder (online mode).  Still, Strike Vector EX is one of the fastest third person/first person shooters of this ""dumbed down"" generation of the fps market.Sure, the game feels somewhat dumbed down itself with the weapon loadouts now forcing all players to have one type of weapon for both arms of the jet now (which was the meta to begin with in the original game) but they all feel like they have more of a punch now.   You should feel encouraged to use other weapons instead of focusing on one gun.  my favorite is the shotguns now, Puts Gears of War to shame with the close quarters combat at 400 + mph in this game.  It's insanely fun.another fair warning: You're always gonna run into other pilots who are better than you (even I got trashed for a bit) but you can still shoot them out of the sky if you just try hard enough, which is part of what this game is all about!   It's a solid shooter all around, fast paced, competitive---all right here.   I wish more people would just stop feeling so fragile about video games these days and just play the damn game.  like if you're not scoring kills left and right like you would in something like Call of Duty or some other mainstream shooter, then don't worry about, you're learning how to play an insanely fast paced shooter.As it always should be, game on folks!So....whats new in this game compared to the old one?? (what if I never played SV before??)welp, don't worry about not having played Vanilla Strike Vector.   Here's a few things to chew on..+Single player modes now availble to help you get to know how to play the game.  Do an offline skirmish with bots too.  There's also some challenge missions in the single player campaign once you see the stadium levels.   I'll say this: there's one mission where you have to escape a whole facility before the place goes up in flames.   Feels like F-Zero GX from the gamecube.+Kebs now have a purpose!  It's in-game currency that you win from online matches, so save them up so you can buy things like cosmetic parts for your vector, concept art that helped create this game, all from the command center button---NO, ♥♥♥♥ Pay2Win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, just play the damn game and win kebs, they're yours.   permanantly if you want but you can use them to pimp out your vector.+Weapons and perks, abilities, and mods configs are now simplified.  Just pick what you want to spawn with, fly out, and go tear it up.  no need to figure out what's a good combination anymore <<  balance issues happened in the old SV I think, some were great, some weren't. I used to run Swarm rockets and miniguns, feels like the generic starship set up, but extremly weak.+ now you can plug a controller into your usb port and play the game just fine.  Just know that the keyboard and mouse setup will always outplay the game controller any damn day of the year.not everyone agrees with this weapon loadouot change but it's whatever at this point.  game's fun.  it's all that it matters.  Hardly any negative things to say about this title, so....that says quite alot.  SV EX has defintely inproved from the last game alright, and I hope the game continues to grow from this point on.and another thing: I'll say it again from my other review:change or dieIt was a thing on the back of a cover for a ps2/gamecube game called ""Robotech: Battlecry"" which was based on an anime show about a special technology called ""Veritech"" which is a fighter jet that transformed into a walking tank and a hybrid of both and they used these machines to fight of some militaristic humanoid giant invasion forces wanting to take over earth.so in SV EX?  change between 2 flight modes while in combat, or you die."

,Recommended,476360,33686687,Posted: 20 July,all,NearsightedNinja,"To make it short and sweet: Buy it for the classic Strike Vector multiplayer. Don't bother for the campaign.// PROS //1. Classic Strike Vector gameplay. Fast and intense. Definitely a great experience if you're a fan of older competitive shooters like Quake. Piloting is similar to Everspace or Ace Online, if you've played either of those two games.2. Snappy controls. Save for a couple minor bugs, playing with a mouse + keyboard feels great. Very crisp and responsive. I would recommend changing up keybinds first to get a good layout as the defaults are pretty eh.3. Good graphics for a cheap title. While it's still not a AAA level experience, it's pretty good. Good update on the original while retaining the original's aesthetics.4. Just straight up good, cheap fun. While it is a very high-skill shooter due to the combination of precise aim + movement skills needed to just survive, let alone win, a multiplayer match, things like homing missiles help to ease the skill curve a little bit. Even if you're not a great FPS/TPS gamer, you'll enjoy this.// CONS //1. The only bad thing I can say so far is my god, the campaign is terrible. I was kind of hyped for a campaign for the game as I had already put way too much time into the original Strike Vector back in the day, but this was honestly pitiful. It's a good thing the multiplayer makes up for it because I would ask for my money back if the campaign was all you got.Terrible voice acting (bordering on cringe-worthy occasionally), an incoherent plot that seems to have been written by a third grader on adderall who saw way too many action movies, and missions that are nothing more than enter map -> enemies spawn -> kill enemies -> cutscene. No Ace Combat-esque behemoths to fight, nor swarms of fighters (most I've ever had on me at one time is 3).Even with the lack of anything of value in the campaign, it's only a whopping hour to an hour and a half long, depending on your skill level.// CONCLUSION //If you're a fan of Everspace and want to see what it's like when the developers do a line of cocaine every morning, take a look at this. If you're a fan of Quake but you just wish there was less floor, take a look at this. If you're looking for a cool sci-fi story, stay away."

,Not Recommended,476360,34013733,Posted: 4 August,all,Flakk,"I picked this up the instant I realized it was released. I was a fan of the Strike Vector but despite that, I didn't play it all that much. I loved the basic gameplay of it but in the end I felt it lacked depth, and the player base died off quick as well.I didn't read up on EX at all when I bought it. I went in totally blind, hoping for a real sequel with added depth and variety.Unfortunately, EX is more of a remake of some sort. It's quite weird to be honest. They added a single player of some description but beyond that, there isn't much extra to it. They updated the visuals, removed the ability to equip two different main weapons and strangely, they remade the controls. The controls really threw me off. It's like they reveresed the logic of them. Standing still is now the default mode. You have to press extra buttons to go forward. I don't agree with this way at all, but I did eventually get used to it. And I rebound some buttons to make more sense to me, personally (I got it from a post from the actual devs... ). I really think this is a case of fixing something that wasn't broken. The old controls were tight as hell. They are forcing you to rethink it. It's possible and not a deal breaker maybe. Just...weird.The single player has a very cringeworthy dialogue and throw-away story with scenarios with bots. I didn't hold my interest for many minutes. That was not what I got Strike Vector for and not what I wanted out of EX.You can also play Skirmish with bots, and if that is what you wanted from Strike Vector, here you go. Perfect. But to me it feels pointless.Multiplayer seem dead on arrival. I would have played at least a couple more hours just to experience the SV gameplay again, if only there were players active. I never see anyone playing the times I've gone online to check. It might be different for your time zone or whatever, but to see nobody playing a completely new game is unusual to me. Even a small game tend to have SOME people playing at all hours of the day at least. Even in servers with poor ping in relation to me.In the end, I can't recommend this. Core gameplay is largely the same as SV, which is good. But I wish they made a proper sequel and not some kind of reimagining/remake/expansion thing. I'm quite confused by why they did this."
,Recommended,476360,33685643,Posted: 20 July,all,Nataliee_chan,I owned and played the original Strike Vector when that came out and I could easily say that SV:EX just improves on what the original was and more.  The addition of a campaign is most definitely a welcome one while not hard it is a good way for new players to get acquainted with how to pilot their vectors so they are not at a complete loss when they join the multiplayer side of things.   Multiplayer is still as good as it always was all though if any returning players have anything to complain about it will be the lack of duel-wielding and being able to have say a shotgun and a gatling gun.  It is a little more simplified but definitely more welcoming for newer players to come and enjoy themselves.

Not this one.One of the biggest advantages of Strike Vector is that you fly across all kinds of debris, corridors or tight corners, surrounded by beautiful cyberpunk scenery. It’s never an empty space. When you get inside the cockpit of a vector it immediately becomes apparent how agile it is. You can dodge shots, change directions instantly and unleash a barrage of death on anyone that gets in your way. Vector is a sci-fi interceptor of the future.Original Strike Vector got it’s needed reboot for many reasons. Mainly because of incredibly high difficulty ceiling. Developers made an effort to split the playerbase based on their skill levels, as well as incorporating bots to make sure servers always have opponents to fight. Some game mechanics were reworked for controller support and now you can actually play this game from the couch.It doesn’t get any easier than this. Strike Vector EX is still a brutal shooting experience where you will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked, unless you’re willing to learn. Fortunately this game has one of the best fan communities on the market. People that shoot you out of the sky faster than you can spit are delightful to chat to, will give you hints and even cut some slack, if you’re new.

I've played other dogfighting games like War Thunder before, and the mechanics behind this game remind me of another game I used to play.This was a pretty good purchase for me. I saw a couple of the negative reviews on it, but they seemed biased. I gave it a shot. I loved this shot.Shotguns seem pretty OP right now, pretty much everyone runs the same setup of shotguns and mines. Enhanced functions are the biggest variation I've seen so far, hoping for more variety in the future, although I doubt much will be done because the weapons themsevles are all nicely balanced, shotguns are just the easiest to use at the start, I think.Anyways yeah. It's only $10 right now, and even if it's not on sale it's still a game that's under $20 for a gameplay value that could easily have been sold for >$30 in my opinion. Go get it already!"

I love that sudden burst of speed feeling when going into speed mode and the vectors and camera shaking the perfect amount.. Not too much to annoy and just enough to give the sense of speed. It has great game juice.Gameplay is a mixed bag of FPS like combat and Ace Combat/Hawx style dog fighting. Controls are tight but the default key bindings aren't so great and it really disappointed me with not recognizing mouse 4 and mouse 5 buttons which would be greatly helpful in this game.The campaign is decently long. Not too long to get you tired of it and ends at a decent length.  Most levels are good (fits the gameplay style) but mostly similar with a few levels that stand out. One of which I think could've been done better but it's a nice change of pace. Overall I enjoyed the singleplayer a lot. Sadly not many people play the multiplayer and I didn't have a chance to play it. One of the best dog fight games I've played in recent memory."

,Recommended,476360,34005892,Posted: 3 August,all,ニンフィア ❤,"Pros:1. Half-mecha Jets that move in super speeds - this game is similar to Project Nimbus, a mecha-based game of similar genre, and Strike Suit series which has planes capable of transforming. SV doesn't transform, but they move EXTREMELY fast to the point of being difficult to control, especially when you don't have auto-lock like the aforementioned games.2. Multiplayer - Games like this simply needs multiplayer to be good.Cons:1. Oddly made xbox controller interface - for some reason the game made the interface such that the control button hints circulates between Xbox controller and keyboard ones. Since most player plays with mouse/keyboard, it should be designed such that it maintains in keyboard mode, but will automatically shift to controller mode if one is detected because I have a really hard time trying to find out which is which.2. Very jerky movements - technically not a cons, because it's the main gameplay of the game where Vectors can do hairclip turns and suddenely change their course of movement, however don't expect this game is played the same way as usual dogfighting genre games do because this one is a tad harder. Demands really high reflexes and training.Overall a really nice game that needs a lot of promotion."

,Recommended,476360,34539949,Posted: 27 August,all,The 3rd Runner,"tl;dr Quake from that alternate universe in which John Carmack got really into VTOLS. An arena dogfihting game with near-flawless multiplayer (limited Vector customization holds it back a bit) and a decently long (7/8 hours any%), cheesy yet touching campaign. Worth full price if:-You're into arena shooters/dogfighting in general.-You don't mind getting wrecked for the first few matches, since what's left of the community is a small but dedicated bunch of pilots that will hold exactly 0 punches against you.-You don't take a game's story too seriously, 'cause this one barely takes itself seriously.-You have at least another friend that can buy it as well, so at least you'll have someone to spar with.If you don't fit in any of those descriptions, just wait for a sale, 'cause if there's any game worth playing, it's this one.Strike Vector EX is basically Quake on VTOLS that look like Warhammer 40k aircraft, and it's as rad as it sounds: smooth (even if not that intuitive, it's gonna take a second to adjust) controls, weapons with lots of nice punch to them and the possibility to switch between Stationary (hovering) and Jet mode, essentially allowing momentum-canceling, make moment to moment gameplay pure ♥♥♥♥ing bliss, 10/10 on that regard.The singleplayer content is there, clearly not the main focus but it's there and it's not bad in terms of replayability and general longevity, with around 8 hours of campaign (15 missions divided in 5 chapters), several extra challenges and a Skirmish mode to practice your setups and techniques with by playing against some (not that stupid) bots. If you're in for the singleplayer ONLY though, don't bother paying full price: this is a multiplayer game at heart, and the kind of all over the place, half parody/half serious story shows it. Get it the moment it hits the sale though, 'cause for a lower price -again, if you ONLY care about the singleplayer- is totally worth the money.The multiplayer is simply a must for anyone who remotely enjoys arena shooters and/or dogfighting, being a perfect blend of both: you get 5 modes (KotH, Team Deathmatch, Free For All, Bounty Hunter, CotF and Demolition) and around 15 maps, and it all just works like clockwork. The maps just look and play rad, and the modes, while not too out there in terms of creativeness, transition really well into the dogfighting formula. Sadly, the mix of highly oversaturated market (thanks, Overwatch) and high skill ceiling has left this game's servers pretty vacant, with only a small bunch of hardcore pilots populating it. So. If you're in for that multyplayer action, either buy it along with a couple friends of yours or prepare to Git Gud.In conclusion, a good♥♥♥♥♥game suffering from the consequences of an oversaturated market and its own relatively high entry barrier. If you actually end up buying this game, play the campaign first and foremost to get a feel for how♥♥♥♥♥♥works, 'cause online the few pilots left ain't gonna do you any favours."

And if you host a game you're just with bots until somebody joins, if they join.I am so dissapointed. I'm refunding this 'multiplayer' game right now because as far as I can tell most of of the players in multiplayer servers are bots. How many players in all multiplayer servers running right now are actually humans? I wish the devs would think long and hard about that question, seriously.This relaunch is a failure as far as I'm concerened, totally wrong direction to take a game that at it's core is so obviously centered around pvp multiplayer like a lot of oldschool games.I think he devs incorperated bots to try and give the multiplayer longevity? To avoid what happened with the first strike vector? Any server with less than six players has bots to make it feel alive! Shot themselves in the foot with that dumb decision!! My friend that bought this to play online with me is alsoo refunding because like me he doesn't want to play in a game that's 4 bots and me until somebody joins (still makes the server 50% bots at that point lol wtf seriously)And regarding the people that are happy to vs bots and play singleplayer. Way to miss the point of the fkn game! IF the multiplayer dies, the game dies. Nobody will buy it when reviews say 'dead online' when it's clearly marketed as multi-player focused shooter. gosh. I've already written a positive review so I need to go change that now as well, i was totally wrong about the online experience it's all bots with a few ppl.Goodluck to devs trying to make money with a multiplayer area twitch FPS and a fked up online play system that's riddled with bots by default and no in-game UI option to disable them (I don't care about .ini tweaks that is annoying to do).honestly I can't understand what the fk devs were thinking putting all servers to 6 bots by default and replacing them one at a time with players joiningsuper, super dumb.Also the networking is p2p so host has huge advantage every time, no word from devs of official dedicated servers."

My initial impressions reminded me of WarHawk on PS3 which is a great thing as Warhawk had some of the best dog fighting around during that era. Even though Strike Vector doesn't allow you to leave your vehicle like WarHawk does, it has a Gerwalk or Valkyrie mode very similar to SDF-Macross fighters which adds a lot of depth (now that I think about it, WarHawk featured a hover mode for their planes as well). I haven't gone online yet but I have started the campaign and fought in a lot of skirmishes. Graphics are fantastic, sound efx and explosions are great and the controls are better than I expected. The great controls says a lot because I'm playing with a configured Steam controller. Being able to boost in one direction, quick turn 180 degrees and fill an opponent full of holes with a combo gatling gun+Tesla Coil is a total rush. The only change I may make for the controls is adding gyroscope aiming which I'll probably take care of soon after I post this. Weapon selection thus far is pretty good too although the plasma cannon scares the h3ll out of me lol.I understand that the original release of Strike Vector was met with some negatives especially when the servers were empty but with EX, there's a campaign, skirmish combat with bots that are a good challenge, online mode with bots and all for a great price. It runs great too, 1080p 60 at max on my rig with a 980m. If a person is a fan of high speed, highly agile, high altitude dog fighting combat you can't go wrong with Strike Vector EX.
