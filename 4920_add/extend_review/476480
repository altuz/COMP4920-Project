They call it MMO, but all that means is you'll see little blue fireballs floating around, in place of other players. It isn't even worth the $0.65 I paid for it, really. If you want a new game to play, you'd be better off with literally anything else. This is just an semi-interactive video."
,Recommended,476480,30186979,Posted: 25 February,all,Baznoc™,"I want to write a review for this game. I thought it was a very beautiful and enjoyable game.I Did have some technical issues with a bug that makes the program fail when closing out of the game; but Other than that, It was a cool game to play, introspective, and deeply thoughtful.I liked the game because I have never Seen a game thats so heavily leans on Buhddism. This wasn't any slap in the face with religion, but exposure to thinking and concepts of success in life, and how people ordinarily, behave and think. Its not like an ordinary game that you go from point A to B.It also has achievments that aren't terribly tough to get but the Journey is what I enjoy...I loved the themes presented, as well. It has some very strikingly beautiful places to go to.7/10 for the bug, but Very Enjoyable."

At worst it is still a pretty relaxing environment that one can just chill in.I'll have to downvote for the misleading title though--there is nothing MMO about this. If it's an attempt to deliver some more zen... it does not work this way son.Also, the player interaction box seems to be in the center of the play area instead of the headset location, which coupled with keyboard control is quite problematic."
,Recommended,476480,29228564,Posted: 13 January,all,Teofava,"Interesting game, I found it very relaxing thanks to a mix of very nice landscape and a wisely selected soundtrack.Overall after a while I found it to be a little bit boring after you have complete the game (found the last scroll and the meaning of life). But I'll keep this game as ""the place where I can relax"" without taking an actual holiday."

,Recommended,476480,29164641,Posted: 10 January,all,kyrenity,"It's a very calming and simple walking simulator; it has some good meanings and teachings scattered throughout the land to keep you thinking while walking around.It could've had a little bit more polish, what with the low draw distance, but it's still a very pretty game regardless. It's cheap anyway so it's worth a try if you're curious."
76561198175173341,Recommended,476480,30066478,Posted: 20 February,all,chubbytubbers,"fun little game, more of a VR experience. i enjoyed walking around and spotting the little animals.  i got queasy flying around though and had to stop playing- the movements weren't quite jelling and i felt a little sick moving too fast. imho something that ""grounds"" the player might be helpful- like sitting a laiktu (sp) style cloud?i'd avoid this if you get motion sick easily."

,Recommended,476480,29980844,Posted: 17 February,all,SexyFlexy,This game invoked a lot of self-thought.  I think I just converted to Buddhism and I am one with the land now.  What is time?  What is life?  This game answered everything.

,Recommended,476480,29957392,Posted: 16 February,all,Croatian Identitarian,"Seems like they have improved since Heaven Island. For $1 (or $0.5 which I got it for), it's a pretty decent game.5/10."
,Not Recommended,476480,30714675,Posted: 24 March,all,Locksheon,"It 'works' in VR, but I definitely don't recommend it.  It will make you sick.This game is nothing more than moving around and looking at objects.The idea of it being an MMO must be taken with a grain of salt.  You might only see another player as a wisp of light.There are no interactions to be had between other players aside from seeing their wisp.The only goal is to move around and see the terrain and maybe pick up an apple."

,Not Recommended,476480,30763822,Posted: 26 March,all,Ekvivu,"Cheap, pointless shovelware to grab money off the novelty of its name.The point is to find a series of (badly spelled) first year philosophy. It does not present any meaninful point of its own.The controls are a horrible idea - you walk with your keyboard (no vive controllers allowed) so you can only move in a 180 degree arc.Environments are blocky, repetitive and low in detail - the load distance is attrocious, so the map looks like mush from any high point.The MMO aspect does not add anything to the experience at all. There is no voice chat and no physical articulation (see above, no vive controllers allowed), so there is no meaningful way to interact with other players. It is there SOLELY so they can catch your attention with the title ""VR MMO"".Do not give them your money."

,Recommended,476480,32938584,Posted: 28 June,all,Life Is All About Balance,"A game that is great to relax, and simply stroll around. Very cheap and great value for what it is.If you love nature, walking and a tiny bit of philosofy.I like this kind of game where you can simply unwind and have no stress at all. Great if you feel down or overstressed but still want to game"
