After spending many hours in this game, I decided to recommend this game mainly because the publisher provided a contact e-mail on its website and after I tried for many hours trying to get an achievement, I gave up and e-mailed the publisher for help in contacting the author Alana for hints in obtaining an achievement.Both the publisher and author were very friendly and helpful and helped me obtain the achievement which I have added in on a published community guide and the game is relatively easy to finish and get all achievements within less than 10 hours."

Several of their offerings already explore life and on the high seas. Not to disparage the other fine offerings already on hand but I hold the opinion that Choice of the Pirate is the best one of them yet.For one, it presents a wide scope in the narrative with a meaningful choice between civilization and freedom. Neither side is shown to be an absolute good but rather present different views on what people value in life. It also has a strong Carribean feel with native magic being intrinsically tied to nature. The set pieces are fun, especially as you meet creatures like merfolk, sea monsters and ghost ships.Overall it is well-written and a fun romp. Each playthrough takes approximately 40 minutes which is decent for a CoG title so no fear of a truncated game either. I won't lie, the previous two offerings from CoG did not impress me much. Heroes: Redemption was basically the author strongarming the reader into listening and playing along with the author's political views while Sea Eternal was kinda meh. Choice of Pirates on the other hand is a strong offering that ranks alongside some of their best works."

I'd advise anyone from purchasing unless they were looking for something different to play. Choice of the Pirate is a game centered around your choices you make in the storyline that ultimately effects the plot in the end... I had a lot of fun choosing and reminding myself to be wary of what I choose... but I gotta say that some of the choices I made didn't really seem to bite me in the♥♥♥♥♥in the end at all. I never heard that character at all ever again after that choice I had made, and I was really expecting them to come back later on and try to stab me in the back for it. It didn't happen though, which was disappointing. I liked being able to pick out my signature clothing as a pirate, however that ""choice"" seemed to be purely asthetic... I created my own piece of clothing and I expected the game to sorta ""substitute"" my choice within the conversation when it came to that point but it never happened. A lot of the characters in the game are meaningless and you won't really need to remember their names since you'll only interact with them two different times out of the whole playthrough. The ""love interest"" really isn't interesting. After hooking up the relationship really isn't brought back up in the story at all until the epilogue in the ending. Another thing, the whole ""pirate king"" title barer is a mystery.... but.... it's not... the story makes it painfully obvious from the very beginning who the pirate king really is.."

So far, I've been reading an awesome story filled with posibilities and a slight flair of humor. You feel like most decisions you make really changes some aspects of the game.For the amount of money this game costs, I'd say you shouldn't be afraid of getting ripped of if you're new to these types of titles. If you've played games like these before, then definitely don't hesitate!Will be buying more of these titles from the developers."

I did sometimes think there was an option or two missing from certain parts- whether because i hadn't done the preconditions or they werent included i don't know. While the choices do seem to customize the story, in my experience they don't seem to change it drastically, which i dont mind too much. Also i would have liked to be able to spend a bit more time allocating my funds when i returned to port, as i only finished the game with 12 ships, though i had over 5000 gold (in one part two ships cost 200 gold so i could have apparently had Quite the fleet).All in all good fun, a lot of choices, and a quick experience that feels solid throughout, though ends somewhat abruptly."

Very enjoyable.I very much enjoyed being able to choose my character and their romantic interests with at least some degree of precision, then have the story respect that choice (instead of just swapping out character names and pronouns to approximate it).That said, $4 is about the right price for this game; that's about what I'd expect to pay for a short novel, and it's good for the 2-3 times I'll probably actually end up reading it.

Doesn't beat you over the head with imposed morals like some CoG titles, and lets you have fun in your own way over the course of the story.

There's an admirable commitment to diversity throughout, as well.  Best of all, it's short, which means seeing all the branches isn't some eighty-hour commitment.

As to be expected of a choose-your-adventure game, there's a multitude of options:  but they're gripping, well played out, and genuinely change the course of the story.  Your skills and relationships influence the plot as well; they're not superfluous percentages that have no bearing on your gameplay.As should be the case, what I loved most was the /story/.  The excitement of battle, the attention to detail, the complicated politics -- all very well done.  The writing is very good.What initially tipped the scales for me to buy the game was the fact that it offered not just an option for the MC to be queer, but ALSO gave you the chance to be poly, AND gave you the chance to be trans or nonbinary (or trans nonbinary).  Like, damn.  What game does that?  Those features were crucial to my engagement wit the game, though I do wish my gender identity had been mentioned/acknowledged a bit more.Overall, yeah, strongly recommend Choice of the Pirate.  You can be a poly gay trans pirate queen and honestly isn't that what all of us want?"

It's like reading a book in which you can make your own choices. It has a wide variety of choices and seems to have at least 4 possible endings maybe more. It is worth a few play-trough’s to explore the options. It is an interactive novel so no expensive graphics or sound effects. All in all I’d give it an 8/10. Some choices you make can go ""unnoticed"" if certain choices are made after. If you enjoy reading and have a thing for pirates I would recommend it, and for only $5(3 during the sale) it’s worth it."

I have been a fan of ‘choose your own adventure’ since the early 1980s when there was little else to do but watch all 3 channels on TV, listen to the radio or play Atari. For those who don’t know there is a whole line of ‘choose your own adventure’ books out there and can be enjoyed again and again just like this game! There is more than one story and more than one way to win – but then again there is more than one way to fail and lose. BUT that is the fun of it! Finding out what was around that corner or behind that door you didn’t try to open the first time. I bought a whole set of books for my oldest son for Christmas the year he turned 9 just as I was when I first discovered them. He now has his own Steam account and has played this game and loves it just as much as I did.I give the game a 10 out of 10 for reminding me that it’s not about graphics or physics, sound and musical score or what high priced actor lent their phoned in talent to the game play. It is about the vision and creativity of the author and I thank everyone involved for bringing this vision to life and sharing it with all of us."

Not one akin to say Uncharted Waters or Sid Meier's Pirates, definitely not alike the Monkey Island series either. Simply put, Choice of the Pirate places you in a slightly magical pirate world where you're dropped into the action in the midst of ship-to-ship combat. Your choices boost certain stats, allow for certain events to happen, etc..So far, you might think it not very different from other choice of games, but this one has its unique features. True, noteverysingle choice has a huge impact, such as the cosmetic ones for your flag and article of clothing... But most do influence things delicately. And the storyline has quite a bit of humor in it.Good points-Good story-Good replay value-Ghost Ships-Many paths to walk-Interesting NPC's-Good integration of magic into the settingBad points-Somewhat few NPC's to romance/etc.-Not that long, a playthrough can last1 hour +/--Does have some Deus ex Machina plot devicesSpecial mentions-You can work 7 years in front of the mast for a mr. Jones in one ending.-Befriending inhumans and magic users really helps.ConclusionFor the price Steam asks, this is definitely a good game to buy.The author's done a fine job on immersion and plot, thoughof course there's still room for improvement here and there.If you haven't ever played a text game though, or if previouschoice of games disappointed you, then try the demo first."

Overall, this game is well worth the money.I highly recommend Choice of Games if you're interested in text based RPGs.  I have played Choice of Pirate as well as Choice of Robots, and I had a grand time with each."
