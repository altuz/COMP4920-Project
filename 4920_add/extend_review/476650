,Recommended,476650,32159641,Posted: 3 June,all,xaerock,"Visual novel detective story, with conspiracies and strange psychic elements as you might expect from Suda51.Dialogue, music, graphics and gameplay are all very 90's style in a way.The mood and a lot of the game comes down to a nice synth soundtrack by Masafumi Takada.Gameplay and visuals are intentionally clunky to adhere to the original PS1 game. However the remastered 2D character art and user interface are pretty stylish and hold up well. The original Silver Case tried to break from usual visual novel mold a little but player interaction is still extremely minimal. There are a few simple puzzles but you basically push buttons to proceed the story. Much of the story is text only with little character art.The story is more grounded and easy to understand than something like Killer 7. It has structure as a detective story without taking into account supernatural or unexplainable events. It certainly gets confusing at parts and unexpected twists might throw your preconceptions out of the window but that's what keeps it exciting. The game may have a tedious start but when the story picks up and characters gain some depth it's not messing around.Playing through all scenarios in The Silver Case will take you around 14 hours, though don't expect to swallow the story as quickly. I thought it took more than 2 hours for the story to really pick up so the refund period might not show much. A couple puzzles at the start seem purposefully annoying to throw you off but that doesn't remain the case.I believe whether or not you'll enjoy this game comes down to if you enjoy the central storytelling and background music. The other things are on the side though fitting as a whole. Expect the gameplay aspect and 3D graphics to be clunky but charming in their own way.PS. I recommend doing the Placebo chapters as soon as you unlock them because of how the game is structured"

The conclusion to the story is pretty much SUDA-ish, if you know what I mean, but the journey is pretty enjoyable on itself.Gameplay is really trivial, you either walk or read text, sometimes it offers puzzles, but they are skippable. And actually, you need to get used to controls, but that's not a bother at all.The music written by Masafumi Takada (Killer7, No More Heroes) sets the right tone to the whole atmosphere and visuals are pretty good.If you're new to Suda games, try to pick some of his other works like No More Heroes, Killer7 or even Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day first.

I was just interested in it because the style was odd for a visual novel.The game is like most of the reviews mentioned:- an English remaster- weird vibes- story that is hard to understand- insanityMost of the reviews even said ""the dialogues are kinda cheesy and lame.""From what I think; it's f*ckin 90's, most people talk like these back in 90's which they thought it was either cool or rude. It's just no one really talks like these anymore in the 2010's, people change.The story is not really generic, it's pretty original in my opinion. A serial murderer so infamous that people got influenced to be a successor, plagiarism, because how they think the murderer is an inspiration the world should know. Later followed by a sick twist that'll leave you confused.Music? It's not memorable, it's not bad. It just does what it was meant to be, filling the atmosphere of the game, either tensed or relaxed.EDIT: Regarding music, some of Yamaoka's remaster are stuck in my head, e.g; Tokio Morishima, and the original OP music is probably my favorite whistling material.Characters? Many of them are memorable. Weird traits and the common ones.What I really like about this game is how they execute it. Its just unlike every other visual novels you've ever played before. Some left my jaw open.It's a must-buy if you're into experimental games, because this one feels experimental for me."

The game was originally released on the Playstation 1, so don't expect to be blown away by its graphics. It does look a lot crisper though and for a game like this, graphics are not that vital in the first place. For fans of SUDA51's previous works, this game does have less action, but his unique vision is clearly present.Not a lot of games like this exist and people who are up for an unconventional adventure game that relies heavily on its unique and often bixarre storytelling and characters, this could be a game for you. The game itself does have some interactive segments, but most of the story is presented to you through a visual novel style of game. There clearly is a vibe that can only be really found in games coming from Japan and this is something that will probably not be to everyone's liking. To be clear, I'm not talking about Anime influences, but more on the tone and atmosphere. Still, this also does mean that the game can be perfect for people who seek out more interesting games than that are less straightforward. There is a reason that so many people are drawn to the gaming worlds that SUDA51 has created.In closing, I would say that if anything has peaked your interest in the game and you're not put off by it's nature, just try it."

It will take a very special kind of player to enjoy this game.The art style is great and the music is okay. The gameplay sections are terribly outdated but thankfully there aren't many of them. The problem is that the quality of the story is not nearly good enough to balance out these flaws.The main attraction is clearly the story, however it is often obtuse for no reason and poorly paced. It's a shame because the story concepts and characters are impressive but crucial revelations are barely explained while the game spends hours on unimportant details. This is frustrating since there's a cool Blade Runner / Snatcher vibe but the story doesn't really go anywhere in the end.Overall, I'm not even really sure if I can say I enjoyed the Silver Case. I wanted to see how it would end so I kept playing but in hindsight I don't think it was worth it. There are better visual novels out there."

You can read it here because I had screenshots and everything so I can't copy-paste it:http://playerprophet.com/blog/the-silver-case/but I will share the basics.The Silver Case is a really bizarre game. I can't say if I think the storytelling holds up or not. I believe that while the plot may have been revolutionary in 1999, so many of its elements have been harvested by other Japanese story-heavy games that we may be desensitized. It may blow your mind though still. I hope it does.The writing is incredible. The characters are incredible. And goddamn the art direction use in the storytelling is the most interesting thing I've seen in a long time. If you're a game designer or even a graphic designer, I bet you'll get a lot out of the visual feeds in this game. It is really, really something, and I'm honetly stunned that I haven't seen people use the Film Window format before. It's very unusual, but take your time when you play and think about how the location of the images is used to expressed different things. It shows a first-person gaze like an element in comic book panelling.The game takes place in 1999 and the localization was carefully constructed to reflect that. At times, it sounds like a crappy anime translation from 1999. This is deliberate, and contributes to the expression of the zeitgeist.I can go on and on. In the end what I'm trying to say is that if you're just into a game for crazy plot twists and gameplay features, you may not like it. If you're interested in seeing a different way to tell a story, please play The Silver Case.It is. really something."

I wasn't too into the first few cases of the game, but about halfway through all of the plot elements start to come together for a very enjoyable and bizarre experience. It avoids a lot of the pitfalls of traditional visual novels by cutting out lengthy inner monologues and focusing entirely on the world and characters you encounter.This isn't a perfect game by any means, partially because of the dated 3D movement (the remaster helps with this some, but the controls and 3D experience are still lacking), as well as some pacing problems. Strangely, all but a couple of the sparse puzzles you encounter have an auto-solve feature. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since the interactive parts are the weakest part of the game, but I feel like some enhancements could have been made outside of adding the ability to skip the puzzles.Play this if you're into scifi crime procedurals and PS1 games."
