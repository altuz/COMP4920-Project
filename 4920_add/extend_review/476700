Spent an hour on my first game, which for an action VR title is not the norm up to now. And just fun not exhausting like some are. Movement is easy, dinosaurs maybe also a bit too easy at the moment, but they act independently and can sneak up on you. Gun play is good. Graphics not as strong as the screenshots but good enough. No frame rate / sickness issues. Give it a go - you won't regret it. Not as polished as Raw Data but I enjoyed it much more so far. Well done to the devs for the most ""fun"" ""normal"" VR game I've played (and I've played almost all). More modes / missions asap pls."

Dinosaurs spawn in the sky and fall down to earth, the game looks worse somehow, and the AI suffered a serious blow to the head.

The graphics need work as well.  I'll check back in 6 months and change the review if it improves.  Defintetly worth getting if it's on sale for £5 (definitely no more than £10) for an hour or two of fun but I'm not sure I'd pay more for it at this stage."

There is no reason as to why you do it. There is no purpose other than to just look for more dinosaurs to kill. The dinosaurs themselves look big and imposing but that's the only thing I find that the game has going for it.I really want to like it but I just can't in good conscience recommend this game given it may entertain you only for the first two playthroughs."
76561198117632336,Not Recommended,476700,25189817,"Posted: 27 August, 2016",all,tveith,"Although this is definitely a good start, there are some issues and enhancements that need to be addressed. There is a fair amount of clipping. The dinosaurs walk through plants, cars, and even through YOU. At the beginning of the game, a dinosaur tried to attack me through a turned over car and got stuck there.At one point, I ended up in a tree house. While attempting to grab a bat, I lost my gun under a wooden plank. It was almost impossible to pick it up again until after about a hundred attempts, I was finally able to time it right to hit it with the bat. Then the gun flew through a wooden plank to the corner of the tree house. Two problems with this: a) I should not have been able to hit the gun through a solid piece of wood. b) The depth of the game is definitely a little bit off as it seems almost impossible to pick up an object while you are elevated in a tree house or tower (note: I calibrated my Vive immediately before playing this game, so it definitely wasn't the floor calibration.) Also, the cargo boxes that are dropped by parachute should be a little shorter so it is easier to open the boxes for ammo, weapons, etc.The BIGGEST problem: I felt NO sense of danger while playing this game. There are two reason for this. 1) THE SOUND!!! The sound really needs to be improved in this game. You need a creepier background score. Also, you are on a dinosaur island yet you never hear any dinosaurs in the distance. The only time you hear the dinosaurs is when they are running toward you to attack. The annoying little dinosaurs make a very stupid sound ""flot flot flot"" and the bigger dinosaurs sound like my Uncle when he has an asthma attack.  2) When the big dinosaurs come running toward you to attack, the camera should shake, you should hear the pounding of their footsteps on the ground, and the roar of their battle cry (this would scare me!!!)  3) There is very little variety of dinosaurs. The little ones always charge first, making their stupid noise, and it becomes very boring and monotonous. The medium and large dinosaurs look the same. A wider variety of dinosaurs with some random attack patterns would definitely ramp up the feeling of danger. As an example, I was really hoping for something like The Brookhaven Experiment or HordeZ -- but with dinosaurs. Can you really kill a raptor or larger dinosaur by hitting it a few times with a baseball bat?? I think not.I really wanted to like this game -- I just didn't feel the ""danger"" you would feel being dropped on an island with dinosaurs. Until the ""danger factor"" is ramped up considerably, the sound is improved, the clipping is fixed, and the variety / attack patterns of the dinosaurs is improved, I can't recommend this title as more than a casual play. I'll adjust my review if future updates improve this title."

Or be hunted..Good graphics, well optimised, good sound. Releases are well tested and clearly operated by professional devs.Some usual early access game quirks but nothing that will turn me off over all."
,Recommended,476700,30159026,Posted: 24 February,all,Nightmare Jack,"tl;dr - This game is really good, and a must have if you're a dinosaur nut like me.This is one of the most immersive and polished games I've played on the HTC Vive. The environment is fantastic even on lower settings, and the dinosaurs feel real. There are still some minor AI issues here and there, but they're the exception rather than the norm.I've been following the development of this game for a while now, and I'm pleased to see that the devs aren't falling short in adding new content and taking in community feedback. It's always a risk with early access, but I feel like it's a good investment.Currently the gameplay is limited to two modes and three maps. Arcade mode is essentially a nice wave shooter with unlocks for a character progression path that will later be implemented for the second mode. Mercenary mode involves a unique mission per map, and that's where the heart of the game currently is.Weapons feel good for the most part. There are a few glitches here and there, but I'm willing to forgive that given everything the devs are working on. They line up beautifully with the controllers. I would love to see a bit more variety in the future, perhaps with more/better thrown weapons. Bringing the controller back to where a quiver would be to load an arrow is a nice addition to bow use.There are a range of ways to move through the game. You can sprint or teleport, and use either the headset or controller to point to your destination. They've also added trackpad movement which, while definitely not for everyone, is pretty cool. That level of inclusiveness is encouraging.I definitely think the game could do with a few more dinosaurs. The levels are big enough for them. I can understand if the devs would rather spend time tweaking those that are already in the game though for now.In conclusion: Island 359 is well developed for its early access status. The game is far from complete, but the current content is engaging, immersive and (the occasional glitch aside) relatively polished. Nothing quite compares to the terror of turning around and discovering a raptor creeping up on you. If you love dinosaur games, buy it right now. The devs are frequently adding more content and improvements. This game is 100% worth its price, and is one of the best VR experiences I have had to date."

If you liked Jurassic Park as a kid and wanted to hunt dino's with a SPAS-12 than this game will be for you. The dev's so far seem to be responsive and what they have so far is nearly worth the asking price."
,Recommended,476700,30806994,Posted: 28 March,all,DanteFaust,"This is a must-have title.  Island 359 does it right on all accounts:-Great graphics-Variety of weapons-Decent sized maps-Variety of enemy types including a T-Rex-Free roaming locomotionIt's intense, fun and has insanely high replay value.  There's nothing crazier than a herd of raptors racing towards you as you quickly try to reload from the last wave of dinos that you just blasted.This is one of those games that I don't think gets the recognition it deserves.  Every time you hear about the Vive people say you have to have the Brookhaven Experiment.  That's a great game but it's just a standing wave shooter.  This game far surpasses it and should be an immediate buy for everyone's VR collection."

Oh my days that game was before its time. This game reminds me favourably of it. It's difficult to be too critical, it's early access like most major titles on the store, I've bought with the hope there will be regular updates and that developers learn from reviews and comments.a few issues with item jerkiness when holding, controllers buzzing for no reason (in the start up screen), unable to shoot through light grass/shrubbery and the lack of variety with weapons and dinosaurs but I'm sure this is going to change. (You earn money, and this goes down as your score. Let me spend it on upgrades!!). One last thing. Respawning enemies, hate it in any game but it keeps you on your toes and this is the point of arena type games like thisI'm hoping this isn't going to be an arena type game. I'd love a game like this to be a survival to a goal, traversing landscape to an eventual finish point with set pieces, physics problems etc (much like trespasser; again, awesome game, google it)Don't pass on this title, support the Devs. Plenty of jump scares, feel like a BAWS opening a loot crate with one up outstretched with a weapon defending yourself.This is going to blossom"

You drop into an open world where you are free to roam around and hunt dinosaurs in order to get a better score (that is if you make it back to the helicopter)The game is in early access and while I haven't dove fully into the game after right around an hour of one session where I didn't realize how long I had been playing I can say this game has an incredible start to what it is going to be after it comes out of early access.I love the graphics of the wooded area that you are dropped into and the sound effects helps bring the ambiance to a new level. I lost track of where I was in the real world several times while playing because I got so wrapped up in what I was doing in the game that I ignored the chaperone lines.The dinosaurs while the Ai might not be 100% yet (a few times the small ones would run up and just stare at me for awhile) are incredibly intimidating. The raptors slowly spread apart to try to surround you (LOVE IT!) and the biggest dinosaur that I encountered had terrifying growls that made me want to turn and run for the hills instead of standing and fighting him.There are health packs, guns, ammo, and attachments that you have to scavenge and get from care package drops (earned from getting dino kills). The randomly generated maps help this game to feel new each time you jump in.The movement system feels very natural. The developers aim for it was to eliminate the disconnect that gamers felt from teleporting so instead they introduced a dash style locomotion where you point where you want to go but instead of instantly being their you more or less spring to the area on the map.If like me you are growing tired of the 20 minutes experiences, no matter how great some of them are, then this is definitely worth checking out! Even in early access it feels like this game already has a decent amount of meat to it due to the randomly generated map and enemies and open world exploration.At $20 this is a definite pick up in my books, not only will it be great to play by yourself but also when you are demoing the vive to friends this will be my go to game for the ""gamers"" in the group. Give them a real challenge and see how they do.I will update this review after I get some more play time in.If you want to see more gameplay other then the trailer feel free to check out my first look gameplay commentary below!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=750518359"
,Recommended,476700,25349903,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,DarkLames,"Really fun and addictive, I have most of the map memorized now. I wish there was more methods of locomotion though. Sprint and teleport are bascially the same thing. I understand battleing motion sickness in VR is a challenge, but there's people out there who don't get motion sick whatsoever and would prefer better movement methods. I hope the developers look into doing something new with locomotion in the future, maybe something similar to The Solus Project's locomotion or Spell Fighter's."

Now the humans has brought them back, and as a human your mission is to once again extinguish their very existence from this planet.You’ll be doing this with a modern arsenal of weapons so advanced you’ll only need ONE BUTTON TO RELOAD. You’ll also be able to travel great distances with the blink of the eye! However, trackpad movement is finally implemented so you’ll be able to walk in a proper manner (optional).(The) Island 359 is absolutely recommended for both new and experienced VR owners. The devs has been releasing regularly updates including bug fixes, improvements, and entirely new game modes. Yes, it’s early access, and yes, there might still be some bugs. But unlike the majority of EA VR games on steam today, this one is handled by two very professional developers."

The urgency to make it out alive or you will not get to keep your credits is slighted by not actually keeping them anyway.. or having anything to spend them on."

Think of it as being placed in the middle of Jurassic Park and your one and only mission is to make all of the dinos extinct and have fun doing so... Since launch the developers have been pumping out the updates while listening to your feedback and that's great to see. Keep in mind this is a early access title so of course it has it's flaws but even in it's current state it is a blast to play.

There's only four guns and three melee weapons, three different dinos, and a somewhat small map once you manage to cover all of it.  Maybe I just have a good sense of direction, but I don't get lost like some of the other reviewers were saying, but I can see how the environment blends together and makes it hard to find your way.  With that said, being chased by a pack of raptors and fighting them off has been some of the most fun I've had with my vive.  That feeling of terror the first time I heard the stomping of an allosaurus before I saw it.  I look forward to see what becomes of this game as more updates and content come in."

,Not Recommended,476700,35213640,Posted: 25 September,all,Manthyus,"To be clear, I wrote this review for the version out as of 9/25. It's an entertaining game, but with the current level of content and polish, only worth picking up heavily on sale.Dinosaurs are a nice change from the ubiquitous zombies, robots, humans, etc saturating gaming. Nothing new, certainly, but still refreshing. The animations and AI still need a lot of work though - nothing looks particularly natural, and even after a couple hours you notice the canned animations. It's especially bad on the big dinos - they track poorly in general (except the triceratops, which makes pretty much no sense - if anything would charge past you, it would be that).The guns feel pretty good for the most part. It's obnoxious to repeatedly get drops for just the basic pistol, though. There are enough guns in the game, but seemingly no way to try them all out or unlock them in any systematic way. The forced recoil is awkard, but that's a challenge of the medium more than anything.I think my biggest gripe with the game as it stands is the bow - aiming feels very awkward because the angle is determined more by the front hand than the back hand. It's hard to describe, but if you've played Gorn it should make sense. It's not unusable, it just feels way worse thansome other games. This wouldn't be as big a deal if the game didn't seem so intent on pushing bow use. There's an entire mode dedicated to it, and the game seems to want to incentivize being stealthy (which as a system seems pretty underdeveloped. When you're using a silencer or a bow, it takes dinos a couple more shots to notice you, but that seems to be about it from a gameplay perspective).To sum up, it's a cool idea and I see some potential here, but it still has a pretty long way to go to get above the level of ""only playable because of the state of the VR market"". I'm hopeful for future updates."

Some things I would like to see:- Fixes on some of the glitchiness of controllers, items.  I am sure they are well aware of this, its not terrible, and can work around it, but certainly a nuisance.- Dinos, lots and lots of more dinos.  I know that is likely the toughest part of it, so I will be patient here, but currently only 4 that I saw, and thats all that shown in pictures as well, so pretty sure only 4 exist.- Game modes - I find I can last quite a while on Hard, I think this game has potential to be both a single player campaign mode, due to the ""Hunting"" aspect, but also a party game where 4 friends could do an Arena/Survival mode to rotate players quickly for competitive play.  Unfortunately, currently the Mercenary mode is fun, but dont know about sustainability as there are only a couple things you can realistically do before it gets repetitive.  Nonetheless the environment, teleportation, room-scale, and overall experience is very well done so it does keep me coming back."

I've played two runs so far, my first time through I thought it seemed a little too easy, I went back to the extraction point after collecting 5 loot boxes. My second time around I found a crowbar and an axe in the starting area and decided to go as long as I could with just melee weapons. That proved to be a pretty fun way to play, but then in the middle of fighting off a pack of raptors, my axe broke. I frantically reached for my backpack with one hand while I was still fending off the raptors with my crowbar, pulled out a gun and finished them off. By this point I was pretty deep into the jungle and dino spawns seemed a lot more intense. I ended up barely escaping with my life that time around. I was pleased to see that the difficulty does seem to ramp up the deeper you go.Overall, one of the better experiences on the vive. Some minor bugs that will annoy you, but I'm sure they will get fixed sooner rather than later. I hope. These include things like the laser sight not working half of the time, some difficulty pulling guns out of the backpack... and now that I'm trying to list them I think those are the only real bugs I ran into."
,Recommended,476700,26417316,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,Snake Knife,"TL;DR: This is an early access game.  If this was the final game, I would not recommend it at all.  Unless you're a shooter or dinosaur fanatic, wait a bit for this one.Island 359 feels like it suffers from the opposite problem a lot of VR games have, rather than an experience that’s way too short for a full game and makes you wish there was more, it offers a good amount of pretty ok game.  Mechanically it felt put together and functional, but the core gameplay of shooting a handgun didn’t hold me for as long as it did in some other games.  I know RAW DATA is basically as good as it gets for action shooters currently, so comparing everything to that isn’t super fair, but unless you’ve got a huge dinosaur kink I wouldn’t rush to buy this game if you haven’t completely played RAW DATA out and just need another shooter.That said, this is an early access game, and I can see that the parts are in place for this to become something amazing.  If the enemies were a little less goofy looking when moving around, the gun a little more satisfying to hit with, and the levels a bit more variety, I would be sinking a lot more time into this game.  I’m giving this game a recommended, because I think the developers have something good going, and that Island 359 has the potential to turn into a full-scale VR game that’s worth spending hours in."

It is quite difficult to render unfortunately, even for my GTX 1080, but the settings allow for a great amount of video changes to set performance. I found Island 359 to be slightly repetative and boring  in terms of gameplay after a bit. The dinosaurs became more of a nuisance than a challenge. However the world discovery remained interesting.One problem that needs to be fixed is the spawning of enemies. I will check an area which is clearly empty of dinosaurs, but the second I go for the ammo box some raptors spawn right behind me. If the dinosaurs are prespawned and roam the map this game would be significantly better.tldr; It is worth a buy, but suffers from some lacking gameplay."

Island 359 doesn't appear to be one those broken alpha survival games where everything makes you frustrated. This game is one of those rough-around-the-edges alphas where the bugs each have their own charm. Whether you're letting dinosaurs run into your melee weapons or trying to navigate your backpack without getting bit in the♥♥♥♥♥ you'll adapt fairly quickly.Cons:-Dinosaurs each have their own spawn points.You either avoid those areas or keep coming back to farm kills.-Uninspired weapons and enemies. These guns came straight out of The Brookhaven Experiment. I'm not kidding. They're exactly the same. They even shoot the same. The enemies are also pretty boring. There are currently only 3 dinosaurs; all the various meat eating baddies you'd expect. Whatever.-Dumb AI. The enemies in this game don't update your location very often. If you move out of the way, they just keep moving to your old position without hesitation. When they get there, they just stand still wondering what kind of supernatural being just teleported away. This makes for painfully easy fights. You can also melee-dash through enemies with the movement system. They'll get ragdolled 40 feet forward without ever knowing what hit them.- As is, the game makes itvery easyto survive. Unless you mess up in at least two ways at once in addition to having some bad luck, you should be fine. There is little challenge until around two whole hours into a run, and it's only hard then because you wasted ammo from being bored. Loot drops gradually become harder to earn which leads to the end of your health and ammo supply around that time as well. In the meantime, you enjoy basically unlimited healing as each drop gives you FOUR health times. There's also very little incentive to shoot at all if you know what you're doing. You can hold unlimited ammo for later / the big dinos anyway. Basically your high score is a reflection of how long you're able to put up with being bored from trying too hard. This being VR, that time usually isn't very long.- Some gunattachments are painfully buggy.The reflex sight is either zeroed in to an extreme distance, or is set WAY too high. It's actually something you never want on your guns. In contrast, the laser attachment should hugely improve your accuracy. The thing is, most of the time it doesn't show up. You can drop your gun (or something like that) to maybe make it reappear again for a short while. Maybe there is a toggle I'm not aware of.UPDATE: It seems hours after this review was posted, an update was pushed to fix lasers.UPDATE UPDATE: The lasers are still missing half the time.Pros:+You can send dinosaurs to space with a baseball bat!That is, if you bother to swing it. They'll die from just running into your melee weapons. This isn't actually a good mechanic, but it's really funny at first.+Upgrades!You can find attachments for you guns. It's a rewarding feeling to carry around 4 guns all overloaded with attachments. There are also max health & max stamina upgrades in each loot drop.+Multiple movement mechanics!From my experience, many Vive users seem overly sensitive about how they wish to move in a game. Dash? Teleport? Run? This game has four different settings. Everyone should be happy.+Puke buckets(no, not from actual motion sickness)! This is my new favorite helicopter ride skipping mechanic. Hold your face to the bucket and skip the ride.+Advanced graphical options(yes, with resolution scaling)! I'm running a GTX 1080 and am able to run most settings fairly high.+ Short buthelpful tutorial!In the main menu area, there are some tables off to the side if you wish to do a quick narrated tutorial.+Replayability!?I can see myself coming back to this a few more times, especially when more content is added. I feel like I've done / seen everything already in a two hour run, but I can definitely do it at least a couple more times."

Would recomend to anyone who enjoys the world exploration with a touch of item management. Now, the downsides...This game is EASY! I mean really easy. most dinos you can just spray and pray down. But if you have ANY aim. smalls die in 1, mediums die in 3 head shots, and Bigs die in 10 Head shots. And you could say you might run out of ammo, but I ended my last run with a little over 1300 rounds for my pistols.Oh, And somethings causes medpacks to disappear from your backpack. Its not auto using them, they just vanish.My biggest issue though, is the damn laser sights on the pistols. they turn on and off with no rhyme or reason. Sometimes you have to put down the guns to turn them back on. Sometimes putting the guns outside the headsets view turns them off. Sometimes reaching for the backpack turns them off. Sometimes that turns them back on, Sometimes not. Got to the point I was holding my arms out just to make sure they didnt go away.All said though. VERY happy I grabed it. Can't wait to see more."

Once you have the freedom to move more naturally WHILE still being able to focus on shooting, the game becomes down right amazing! Not going to lie I thought the game was clunky feeling while I was using the teleport option of movement. If you're new to movement with out teleporting it's a little bit of an adjustment and some people get a little dizzy for a second, but so far I don't know anyone who hasn't quicky adjusted and loved it. The guns mostly feel great and natural. Though some do seem to shoot a hair low while using iron sights, mainly the Uzi for me.

,Recommended,476700,34003727,Posted: 3 August,all,JadeK,"https://youtu.be/WPhMmED0npYKill dinos. Grab loot drops. Get out ALIVE. Island 359 is a fast paced survival shooter game. The gameplay involves hunting dinosaurs, using weapons such as a bow and arrow, knives, guns, whilst also upgrading weapons, picking up loot drops with useful items and more weapons, and most importantly trying to survive the dinosaurs. The chosen movement system includes trackpad and teleportation movement, and you can ‘sprint’. The game could do with some improvements such as the design of the dinosaurs to make them more realistic, the bow and arrow can be a little tricky to use in comparison to other archery mechanics I have experienced, and I would also like to see some story or information added to the game to give the missions more purpose. However, the design of the game is cool, the sound effects are excellent, I like the concept of the game, it definitely gets your heart racing, and there are some very tense and immersive moments whilst encountering some of the dinosaurs up close that give you a feeling of danger. The game also has two different modes, arcade mode which plays like a wave shooter, and a mercenary mode with three missions that take place within three different environments/maps. There is also a competitive aspect as there are global leader-boards. As such, I recommend this game to any dinosaur fan looking to play a dinosaur FPS in VR, the mercenary mode in particular as this is what makes the game worth purchasing. I have also seen improvements to this game such as the addition of new dinosaurs (as this game is in early-access), we can expect more updates in the future, and as a dinosaur fan this has been a cool experience so far. The game may be a tad overpriced considering the current replayablity value, but I think it has a lot of potential, and I am happy that I purchased it as it."

When that becomes the highlight of the game you know there are problems.  The game has bugs, as during the tutorial I managed to skip ahead where I found the dinosaurs just standing there.  I killed them, and when I realized I didn't trigger the next waypoint, I basically had to restart the tutorial all over again because the game didn't realize that I already completed the task.Gameplay:  Tried the bow and the mechanics, especially from other games which focuses on archery, wasn’t the worst, but not the best either.  I quickly switched to hand held weapons.  The Uzi felt odd, would have been better if I could select which hand I could hold the weapons with instead of mandatory assignment.  I immediately felt the repetition in this game.  Especially the exact repeating mechanics of the dinosaurs.  Oh, look dino1 twin brother has arrived to avenge his death…Pop, pop, pop dead.No barriers on stationary objects.  Found a brontosaurus grazing, walked up to it, ended up in its framed body, which was very hollow. 😊 To the Humvees where you can open their doors, which would automatically slowly close, which was disconcerting as it would pass through me while I was looking in the vehicle.I know this is early access, which I hate developers doing this because they take our money and I’d say a good majority of the time the game never gets fully finished.  Why would they bother?  They have your money.  There are talks about a campaign which may increase its value if there is a good story, but right now this is just another wave shooter, which unfortunately has saturated the VR environment and is growing ever tiresome in my opinion.Kudos to the idea of the game, but it is far from finished and needs serious polishing and improvements.  Thankfully Steam’s refund allowed me to try this out.  Is it worth the price point…Hell no as there are better wave shooters out there for a lot less.PROS:•	Dinosaurs•	Graphics are pretty good•	Options for movement to allow for user’s best comfort•	Bucket in helicopter…found it amusing as a option to skip the flight sequence.CONS:•	Some flickering in graphics, made it hard on the eyes•	Wave shooter with minimal variations to the animals•	Lack of proper mechanics for raptors.  There has been countless documented material on how they acted in the real world…Pack hunters they are not in this game.•	Object passthrough•	Tutorial was more enjoyable than gameplay.•	Price point for what you get right now is too high, especially when there are far more enjoyable wave shooters out there which cost far less.•	Another wave shooter"

It started off fun, i did the small tutorial and liked the mechanics and the setting of the game.So you get dropped off in the jungle.. equip your m9 and head out (same exact model and sound effects from the brookhaven experiment) and then realise for everything to run smoothly on my GTX 970 everything has to be mainly on low settings with the odd medium thrown in. (ok i figured... its minimum requirement)so i walk forward and get attacked by the tiny dinosaurs in packs of 5.  try to shoot them and the aiming is off,  only when they get right up to my feet could i hit them, so i shot all 5 at my feet and carried on... 10 seconds later.  another 5 dinosaurs  same ones.. all run to my feet and have to look directly down to kill them...   not 6 seconds later  another four of them run out.  later on i saw 2 velociraptors and killed them which got me a loot drop.  go to my loot drop and theres those tiny dinosaurs again  while im trying to resupply and heal  i have to continuously shoot my feet to get rid of them..  and the other gun i get from the crate, an uzi.. is also ripped straight from brookhaven experiment, so is the revolver i found later on.  To me the game feels like a more ambitious brookhaven experiment without the polish  except instead of standing still you teleport and instead of the waves of zombies   its tiny tiny dinosaurs.. with a velociraptor or two thrown in.CLOSING COMMENTS : I can see how the game might be fun for someone for 30 minutes after taking in the atmosphere, but then get bored with the same hard to hit enemy type running at you every 10 steps you take."

The weapons and gameplay are fun. I especially like the clint eastwood style revolver- YES! I LOVE the movement options, the ability to choose. For my friends who get sick easily, they can choose sprint and not get sick and its still much better than that dumb teleporting that every other game does. When I get my virtuix omni I hope it will support some kind of normal tradional keyboard or joystick movement (which the omni can emulate or they also have an api for native support). Running in place or dynamic fov motion based adjustment are other movement options to consider.I will say however that even on ""crazy"" mode, its just too easy, and Im not even very good at FPS games. Even on crazy mode, I can just sit there with a knife and the little dinos run and impale themselves on my blade. All i have to do is make a slight swipe motion. Then the blade broke and it took me several seconds to figure out what happened and take out my backpack and get a gun- all the while a dinosaur was biting me and I still lived LOL. The pathing for the bigger dinosaurs seems messed up, they get hung up on a log and I can just leasurely shoot them while drinking a cup of coffee if I wanted to. Intelligent raptors which hunt in packs and coordinate would be awesome. As it is Im not terribly scared because its just too easy still, with little chance of death.Other ideas would be multiplayer coop or vs with the ability to play as dinosaurs, and possibly random maps which are different every time with randomly placed items, loot and bad guys. But for right now Id say first priority is increasing the difficulty even more (this review is post difficulty patch). And of course fighting bigger and badder dinosaurs like a TRex or a megladon in the water woupd be sweet.Great work so far, and I do recommend buying this game even though its too easy, they will probably fix that."

Really hurts the pacing of the game.-some of the dinos you can kill by just waving a bat at them. In all honesty the atmosphere of that game is all wrong. I dont feel like im fighting dinosars I feel like im fighting todlers with roid rage.-The ladder climbing mechanic is interesting but I don't think VR is ready for vertical movement like that.

I know there seems to be a need to find a better navigation system, but there's a reason why the controller-pointing insta-teleport is the one found in most games.  Either way, they even included a puke bucket to skip the helicopter ride.  GENIUS!The graphics, sounds, controls and innovation (inventory, stamina, upgrade systems, etc.) are all top notch.

All of the mechanics are designed for VR and for the most part work solidly. I have a slightly above minspec VR computer and the game caps me at medium resolution, which looks good but not great. Better resolution would probably make the little ones easier to see, because they can be hard to spot even when right next to you.There's a lot here for early access and only $20. The edges are only a little rough (Reloading the revolver feels a little hit or miss on getting it to close, items will sometimes fall through the ground, and the desktop (spectator) window can't be resized or moved) but these are not game-breaking and I'm sure will get ironed out."

As a notice to the devs themselves I have a lot of idea to make this game better/ Some of which being not being able to teleport through dinosaurs, better ai's because if you just teleport through something it'll run to your previous spot and stand there for a second before coming back at you.

The revolver's chamber keeps falling out and the beretta's laser sight doesn't want to stay turned on or synced to the gun movements.

It's very buggy, way more so than the brookhaven demo was which was free. Guns and dinosaurs seem to disappear as well as flying/cliping about the map most of the time your shots seem either to not register or don't appear to have any effect. The novelty of the dinosaurs wears of pretty quickly especially when the show either no interest in you at all or just mindlessly hop towards you. I think a zoo where I could look and pet the dinosaurs would have provided me a better experience to be honest.The animations and models are ok but they could use a lot more variety. The attack animations are also pretty stale I want to get eaten by an allosaurus not have it peck at my knee caps while the screen fades red! It would probably make you really motion sick but player death animations might be nice.Content wise there is 1 very small and pretty boring map with 3 dinosaurs and 4 guns travelling about the map and looking for dinosaurs was pretty nice even if the movement is pretty jittery,also if you get any form of vr motion sickness avoid this game at all costs.The devs were obviously in a rush to provide content for the new vr market however I think they were a little premature.I hope the devs continue to polish up the experience and add a lot more dinosaurs and environments as it could really make this worth a purchase."

People are way to unreal. This is NOT a run and gun game. This is not a simulator like Onward or Virtual Warfighter. But this is a very enjoyable game. This is a good looking game. IT HAS DINOSAURS !!! And it will get more as content is added and support from us is given. The team is only 2 people and they have been trying to do all they can to fix and tweak constantly. Sometimes that means rolling back and starting over. That is fine with me as I am glad to support this title. As far as copying from other games as others have said....really? Of course a lot of VR games will use the same assets. That is nothing new but this game is its own thing and it is open world and free roam. The merc mode you have to go out and hunt as many dinosaurs as you can and then you decide when to go back. It is a test of time, will, strategy and mental toughness. Obviously, the longer you stay out the more dinos you kill and the better score you will get. The mental part is that the longer you stay out the more fatigued you get in real life and then the question is when will you make a mistake if you do push time further along? The Big Hunt mode is a little harder as there is less cover to use and using stealth is more to your advantage. There is a simple mission to kill 3 dinos (at this time) and collect some special ore for testing. Kill gather and evac. The Second Hunt mode you start with a bow and then can find some guns as you search and explore but they are sparse. There are plenty of settings for locomotion, graphics, sound and diificulty. Overall this game to me is what I wanted in VR. A game to see and kill dinosaurs and roam freely through my VR world.

Island 359 would fill the gap. Overall I am satisfied for buying this game considering it is an early access.Some notions / improvement suggestions:- At the very beginning of the game I did set graphics to the lowest setting in order to avoid jitter with my GTX 970. After flying to base camp the graphics settings were defaulted and I had to set the graphics settings again. After killing few velociraptors the game began jittery again even when staying in the lowest graphics setting.- At first level I was too long at base camp looking around. Voice began to say that I should enter the helicopter although helicopter was not there. After a while helicopter appeared and I had to climb on it without entering the hunt field. If it is mandatory to start mission in some time, there should be some kind of timer showing the time when a person have to exit base camp for hunting field.- In my opinion dinos appear too dense, especially the small turkey ones. I think there could be more hunting feeling if you don't have to constantly kill those dinos. There should be possibility to hide / cover yourself from them.- Sometimes weapons seem to disappear somewhere.This said, the game is still enjoyable and hopefully I get better graphics card some day to enjoy it full potential."

Based on the last dev update there are exciting things in the works, so the future looks bright for this title.What it is:  This is basically a dinosaur hunt (mercenary mode) through two different maps (at the moment).  So far I have only encountered 4 different dinos but they are all well defined.  In mercenary mode you are dropped at a camp given a pistol or a bow and told to kill dinos.  The maps are failrly expansive for an early release, and the missions/tasks are challenging.  You are rewarded for mission accomplishments and the difficulty level continues to increase so it stays challenging.  The dinos, especially the Raptors, keep your heart racing the entire time.  The arcade style of play is basically a stationary wave shooter, and though it may be fun muti-player, to me, it's not nearly as fun as mercenary mode, so not really my cup of tea.The bow is a little difficult to work with, and I've had a few supply drops give me a gun but not the correct ammunition for it. All minor things, but if you are playing in hard mode, getting a useless gun can be frustrating.  It may also be a bug, the gun arrived with clips, I picked up the clips before picking up the gun.  It would be nice to be able to holster the weapon, rather than put it in the pack and have an even bigger variety of them (though admittedly I haven't yet seen them all).  Making something like this more of an open world and adding a variety of missions, not just kill missions; maybe personnel rescue missions, or capture and retrieve missions, etc; the possibilities are endless, would make it awesome.Well worth the price, especially since it's fun now, and it's an early access title with potential.  The devs are planning major overhauls to the in game avatar and the dino AI according to the last update, so I'm hopeful.Thumbs up!"

Its still pretty fun now, but it is extremely buggy. It is far enough along to make it playable though. I really like how you're exploring rather than being tied down to one room like in Raw Data. This is a shooter, but not a wave shooter, and thats a breath of fresh air.Some of the bugs include clipping issues, and somehow I lost my gun midgame though I didn't drop it or put it in my backpack. Also, don't expect AAA level graphics. THough it appears this game has great graphics, they are anything but optimized. With a 1070, I was only able to play comfortably with the graphics on low.As is, $20 is perfectly reasonable for this game. I'm sure most of the bugs I mentioned will be fixed eventually. I definitely wouldn't blame you for letting this game bake for a little while though."

Currently having some audio issues after upgrading from GTX 980ti to Titan X Pascal. It doesn't make sense that that would affect the audio, so it may just be a coincidence.

The gunplay is accurate and the guns have a nice realistic feeling to them. The graphics are AMAZING and the dinosaurs are pretty sharp i.e. they will hunt you, swarm you, and even sideline you if you're not paying attention. The developers keep adding a lot of content and refining the game often. I would say if you're a FPS fan this game is a must have. The also recently introduced trackpad locomotion which makes the game way more fun and imerssive. Just yesterday I was running backwards while 3 raptors, an allosaurus and about 10 compys were chasing me while I was reloading and spamming them with 50 cal handuns akimbo!!"
,Recommended,476700,29133775,Posted: 8 January,all,Task_Force_357,"While this game still has a long way to go before I would dare call it the best VR title on the market, I would definately say that it is my favorite!I personally much prefer to use the touchpad locomotion and I've surprisingly experienced no motion sickness whatsoever, and I'm very sensative to that. Combine the fluid free movement with the particularly high graphical quality of this game and you have an extremely immersive title. It's got good gunplay, fast-paced action, and a fair weapon variety. That being said, the game is definately a work in progress, but it has been recieveing constant updates from it's 2-man development team since the day I bought it.Pros:- Very immersive- Good gunplay, subjectively speaking- Decent replayability- Many fun high-octane moments.Cons:- Lacks a much needed sence of progression or achievement in it's current state.- Could definately benefit from more dino variety (Pterodactyls please!)-Somewhat frequent bugs and crashes in it's current state (From my experience)^ Each and every bug and crash I've encountered has since been resolved!Having read the dev's plans and aspirations for this title, I have very high hopes for where they will take it. I've submitted two bug reports and gotten same-day responces and almost same-day fixes for both issues. The developers replied quickly, spoke kindly, and fixed my issues with high priority. If the attitude of the developers says anything about this game, I have very high hopes for it's future.If you're unsure about buying this title, it wouldn't hurt to wait for more content, but I still can't help but recommend it in it's current state."

,Recommended,476700,29165197,Posted: 10 January,all,Southpaw,"This game exceeded my expectations! Really fun.With so many ""futuristic pew pew"" or ""omg zombie"" VR games out there, this game looked like a refreshing change with it's jungle setting and dinosaurs. Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything much though, since from my experience dinosaurs in video games are never done right. The animations are always clunky, awkward, and the AI and pathfinding usually suck. However I was really surprised by how well done these dinos are. They move very well, the raptors will stalk you or call for help, the sound effects (roaring and stomping) are really nice. The gunplay and overall setting is really immersive and I had a blast my first playthrough. Seeing the giant allosaurus come stomping up to you, or hearing a raptor calling for assistance is truly terrifying. Great job devs!Here's just my first impressions and what I'd like to see added:- I think we need more ways to interact other than shooting..i'd love to be able to set down a spike trap or something and lure a dino into it, shoot a flare to distract them, put down bait...- I'd like to see interactions with the dinos, when i get in over my head or surrounded by raptors...i should be able to lead them to a bigger dino or triceratops in order for them to fight it out and distract themselves.- It would be neat if the larger dinos could destroy certain trees as they come charging at you, or destroy the giant tree stumps/limbs you can hide on top of after taking damage."

I hate teleport but I also found the little dinos annoying and there were some weird bugs with helicopter. The good news is that the development team behind this game is very active (even experimenting with future full body tracking!).Island 359 has improved a lot since last year.  The full locomotion using trackpad really brings this game to life (with teleport it felt like a Myst adventure).Default walking speed is brisk but if you click forward on the trackpad then you run.A new locoation (Beach) has been added complete with beach huts and little boats.I love the weapons and the weapon mechanics in this game.  They have a solid feel to them and the gun sounds are excellent.Look forward to the night mode that's coming...Dinosaurs are now scary (last year I didn't feel that) but now there is a sense of tension and fear when a big dino sees you.I recommend you buy...

This game is phenomenal! Dinosaurs are a hot topic for VR, and I'm so happy I've found a game that knows how to do it right. I hate to compare this game to another because it is a unique title that separates itself from other non-VR dino games, but if you like any game or film that has dinosaurs then you'll never want to take off your HMD after purchase. What's better is that the developers are extremely active in the Steam community and respond promptly to any bugs or problems that you may come across. I've experienced it first-hand and will continue supporting this game due to the dedication the devs have. The game is new with lots more coming in the future, but it is far from an empty game. When you go from the hunter to the hunted you'll absolutely feel a little bit of terror just before the dinos attack. I couldn't recommend this more."

But we don't quite like the game modes.Arcade is too static, you are just receiving waves of dinosaurs till you die. But you cannot move anywhere, you are nailed to a spot on the floor. This is frustrating and a little bit frightening. If you could just move around, or use any environment advantage...Mercenary was frustrating too, being supposed to kill a triceratops with a bow on our first encounter while being attacked by velociraptors. Even if it doesn't have a campaign or story mode, a learning curve would help.For both modes, my advice would be to look more like Arizona Shunshine (moving around arcade and silly story at least leading the mercenary mode)"

Basically for now you have 2 maps which are decently sized and open for you to explore for loot and kill dinos and that about sums up the game. You spend most of your time killing compys and Raptors . Every so often you will see a Tricerotops, Stegosaur, Allosaur (i think) or the dreaded T-Rex which is like a walking Tank. Hopefully more dinosuars are coming .The game came out August of last year and i would think there would have been more in the game by now. They are still updating it so it hasnt been abandoned so far. I'm guessing its a very small dev team of a few people. There are a good amount of options as smooth turning and free movement.Part of me wants to say hold off on buying this till there is more content added but i have 9 hours in it as i am wrighting this. and it is fun.
