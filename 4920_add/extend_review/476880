Limited graphics, no voice, puzzles that kill you and force you to start from the beginning of the game is not anyones definition of ""relaxing"". Maybe there is a heart somewhere but it is probably a picture and not what you will feel if you play this game.Two thumbs down - I would give it 10 thumbs down if I had more!"
,Not Recommended,476880,26246709,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,Lucky Thirteen,"Rescue Lucyis a point & click adventure with a touch of horror elements in which you click on objects that look like they could be picked up. The real challenge here comes from trying to figure what those objects are(there are no descriptions)and where to use them(most of the actions don't make a whole bunch of sense).The story is very basic - you are a little girl, your dog Lucy got lost in a spooky manor and you must find her.The interface is something you would expect from a free to play flash game, although thereisa main menu and pressing ESC doesn't quit to desktop, so that's a plus.Rescue Lucyoffers two free DLCs, but every problem with the main game is even worse in these DLCs.Stories are practically non-existent, you are just a random person wandering around random spooky mansions for some extremely trivial reason and whatever little sense the main game made is taken away completely."

If you are short on time, and don't mind blindly clicking objects, while trying dumb combinations, then this game is for you."

There is a lot of going back and forth, and back and forth especially if you don't kill the bad guy in 5 seconds or less. You then get knocked back to the very beginning and have to make your way back to the room with each wrong guess, and try again until you pick the correct item/combined items.  No puzzles, no hidden objects, just pick up a few items and see what goes with what, and what to use on the bad guy. And the bad guys ""try to do the pop out at you"" scare tactic, :(  Glad I didn't pay much.  For a die hard Point and Click, or Hidden Object player, I don't think this game will be for you. Too easy and way too short."

Even at less than £2 it is not worth it. took about 35 -45 mins to finish ( rest of time was running up and down stairs for my gran who's ill) ok game to pass the time for a bit, but should be about 99p!"

Yes because it's very nicely made and it looks like it would have been an epic game if it were longer. Also it has the right concept but distributed it the wrong way. No because it throws you into the game and pretty much says ""♥♥♥♥ you, learn how to do it yourself"" so you're going off blinded as you're getting 'killed' over and over again because you dont know what to do. Not to mention the tutorial is literally the second video on the store page... >.>"
76561198052965201,Not Recommended,476880,23486991,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,Derrick Rifkin,"Add 2: HOUSE ESCAPE DLC #2Out of the three this one to me is the most playable, it's still a pixelhunt and the puzzles aren't extremely well-explained, but trial and error seems to fix most of it. The atmosphere is creepy, but it seems that the death-time is gone in confrontations. The ending is also a lot less abrupt and disjointed than in the previous DLC. I'm still not going to recommend it, simply because of the fact that this is the most enjoyable one out of the three. The original (which you need) isn't very good, but a lot of the issues I had it with seem to have been taken into consideration (last lock combination was a bit weird unexpected, though).ADD: ESCAPE HOUSE 23 DLC #1This isn't much different from the original, spooky atmosphere (but only a single moment of actual danger), obtuse puzzles, no sense of direction, no changing cursor to indicate interactables, no explanations and an extremely strange, unexpected and quite simply inappropriate ending. So since the original was obviously a finished product, I'm changing my recommendation to no.I really wanted to like this little game... but I couldn't, not completely. It's utterly unclear what is and is not interactable or what items could possibly lead to a solution of any sort.I did however like the encounters, though if they're going to be fatal, it would be nice to have a retry option. I also liked the idea of having them timed, so you can't just randomly try stuff to see what works, but are better off scouting, then retreating and thinking what would be most effective.It is a nice little concept of a game, but I would really like to see it more fleshed out. Just for the fact that I think it has promise, I'm recommending it, but it feels very unfinished and unpolished (EDITED)."

Very short game. It was really lovely though and I did like the atmosphere. I still won't recommend unless more content is added.

,Recommended,476880,29600911,Posted: 31 January,all,Tsuki❤,"This is not a hidden object game. This is a ruthless P&C (point-and-click). The tutorial has no words and lasts about fifteen seconds. There is no save, so if you mess up then you must go to the main screen and click continue game. The only thing that's truly irritating is the gnome enemy. All the others you can back away from (change rooms) so you can switch to a different equipped item. Don't walk into the kitchen with the appropriate bribe money. The final enemy may be the same way but I was properly prepared at that point.Those that are complaining the game is short cheated and looked up a video guide (or inadvertently watched the developer's guide). Because this game is based off of trial and error, the game is more than an hour long. An hour of entertainment is worth $3. But you find this on sale often."

The gameplay itself is classic point and click which I love! And the atmosphere and mystery was quite intense! I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nice, relaxing experience whilst also having a lot of patience as it's not always very clear what to do in the game but nevertheless, still a great game and it's definitely worth the money!"

It's short, repetitive, lacks positive direction at times and has the worst inventory system I've seen anywhere. Even with the 2 free DLC games that are provided with it I can't really recommend it. Best avoided unless you're desperate - 3/10."

The graphics are nice but the rest of it is a flaming dumpster fire.It is NOT a hidden object or adventure game, it is a point and click where you pick up items, find keys and try not to get ejected to the main menu by monsters. The entire game took me less than 45 minutes to beat without a guide and there are no built in hints.I am pretty sure that the gameply videos above show you how to beat over half of the game and if I had gotten this game for free, I would still have demanded a refund.1/10 because Lucy the doggo is cute. Do not recommend."
