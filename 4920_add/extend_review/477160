Really fun, and not too hard to grasp the movement. There's a slight learning curve when climbing, but it's easy once you learn how. For some reason, tho, this game gives me motion sickness something fierce. So, only good in short bursts for me."

She keeps asking if we can play ""the floppy guy game"".  After she went to bed, I played co-op with my wife and we were laughing so hard we could hardly play at times!  My wife isn't really a gamer, but we used to play Portal 2 together and this was a similar ""work together to win"" kind of game, only much more hilarious!My daughter and I actually beat this in about 6-7 hours but that didn't really matter, we're still playing it.The controls seemed to be fairly difficult for my wife to get used to, but it didn't seem to bother her too much because it just made for some really comical moments.  I would also like to note that watching 2 other people play this game is almost as fun as playing it yourself.*Pro-tip* Use the restroom before playing and/or watching someone play this game (you've been warned)Can't wait for future DLC!

,Not Recommended,477160,32179196,Posted: 4 June,all,Kryyss,"Candid Camera. Beadle's About. Trigger Happy TV. What do all of these things have in common? Enterainment based upon someone else's misfortune or their reaction to an annoying situation. You then also have shows like Takeshi's Castle  which are entertaining because of peoples epic fails at doing the most simple of tasks. And just like those shows, HFF is only entertaining when played with someone else. Let me explain.In itself, the game is more about wrestling with the controls than puzzle solving. That may seem odd but this is really the fact. The puzzles are not hard. They aren't going to test your creative logic or have you pondering for hours with the answers staring you in the face with a cheeky grin. It's about managing to achieve a very simple task with completely inadaquet controls. HFF isn't even the first to do this since the days of Grow Home and Grow Up we've had procedureal animations kicking around and frankly HFF's controls are less tight by comparison and that works against it when it attempts to ask you to do something simple like jumping a gap or walking along a narrow edge. The only thing it does well it grasping and lifting objects. As a result, playing the game by yourself is extremely tedious. But when working with someone else it is extremely funny to see how your buddy is completely failing to perform even the simpliest of tasks. I guess the lesson here is that it is only entertaining when it isn't happening to you.Given that there are many other games out there with amusing cooperative play it would be only fair to say that HFF is not something I can recommend because unless you have someone else with you the game just isn't entertaining. Furthermore it is very, very short and has absolutely zero replay value. If you want a game like this for solo go play Grow Up or Grow Home. If you want a good party game then try Gangbeasts or A Gummy's Life."

The puzzles are not however the express obstacle to overcome. Much like Grow Home when you press LMB/RMB or the trigger of your gamepad the corresponding hand is outstretched directly away from the camera and from there you can direct it as you wish. It acts more like a sticky pad then a hand.You'll be doing things such as climbing, arguably the main mechanic and other more intricate things later on. For example, rowing a boat, operating a forklift, connecting wires to batteries and generators and loading catapults.A lot of these physics games humor is derived from the very odd things that happen organically just from playing and watching the physics play out. But early on this game has some tutorial videos that lend it a bit more character. It feels a little Portal-y up front. It also has some slightly epic if not ironic music throughout.I say Portal because of the corporate detachment vibe the videos give off. As well as for the reasons in the early stages that it is very closed in and controlled. The stages then evolve into a much more open space that doesn't necessarily encourage exploration; No traditional collectibles are to be found. However, there are some achievements from doing things that aren't really required that can be fun to accidentally run into, often found from going off the beaten path.There is also some very odd 3D MS Paint/Blender-esk thing to paint your character. It has webcam support as well. If you desired to bring the real world into the digital.THE GISTIt's an enjoyable fun, relatively short game that at times can be a bit frustrating. Either from knowing what you need to do and not being able to execute or just not really being sure where to go. But those times are outweighed the good.Follow my curation for more"

We were not expecting much from this game. But I am glad to say that we are not disappointed. This is a very fun and sometimes challenging puzzle game. The mechanics that are used in this game is really great. What really took me by surprise is two things. One the fact that there are multiple ways to complete a puzzle some easy some hard but all fun. And two in some of the areas there are places you have to explore. There are tons of stuff to see and do in this game. I absolutely love it. Definitely worth the money

I think there should be some new levels such as a big clock, a forest on fire, a battlefield with working tanks, mines... a city with skycrappers mostly covered by the ocean, or an alien space base with changing gravity (Gravity strenght and direction), a candy land, a metal molding/welding factory (To create your own tools), ..."
76561198004001866,Recommended,477160,24622251,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,Podmo,"Recommended, but with caveats.The game is mostly fun, and I got some real moments out of enjoyment out of some of the puzzles and especially out of the character.The feel is a little like Octodad meets Portal, but without the soul of either, and that's part of the issue. You get a snarky narrator for all of, like, thirty seconds, and then the game is mostly played in silence. The music is nice...when it's there. The whole thing feels a little empty. The world looks like it has interesting stories to tell, but you'll never know, because there's no substance beneath the puzzles.By the end of the four hour play time, some of the puzzles start to wear thin. Especially because the second-to-last level is frustrating, what with all the water around that makes even the smallest screw up into a drowning offense. Be prepared to respawn and restart puzzles there a lot...which is not fun. Also, the final level feels pretty repetitive over most of its length, which isn't great.Where Portal and Octodad left me wanting more, I was perfectly happy to be done with this game in the end. I didn't really want to spend any more time working through the world.I hope there's more support, maybe some new levels provided that provide more diversity. But one of the core problems, the ultimate hollowness of the game, isn't going to be fixed by patches. The narrator at the beginning makes it feel like the devs wanted to make this a more fleshed out experience, and just ran out of time or money.If you're in to wonky, physics-based puzzlers, this is worth picking up. If you want them to have some depth, keep looking."
76561198078127192,Recommended,477160,29595935,Posted: 30 January,all,DaaaahWhoosh,"I came back to rewrite this review because it turns out this game has great replayability potential.Basically, in this game you run around, and you can reach out and grab stuff with both arms. There's some objects you need to pick up and use as levers and such, and there's some machines and platforming and opening doors and such.It doesn't sound exciting. But you know when you're drunk, and you can barely walk, and every simple task feels like a challenge? It's kind of like that.Not only that, but once you start to get the hang of what this game is, you can start breaking the rules. You can go off the beaten path, use items from the previous puzzles in new and exciting ways in the next one, you can climb to the top of all the things you thought were just there for decoration.And the sooner the better. Replaying the game, there's so much I realize I missed the first time through, because I was so busy finding shortcuts. Not only that, but sometimes I just didn't know what I was supposed to do, so I think I must've gone the wrong way. For instance, once I drove a boat into a wall so I could jump over it, I'm just now discovering where I was actually supposed to drive that boat. Not only that, but once I got there I found a secret area, leading to a part of the level I'd never seen before. I don't know how much more there is to this game, but it's a blast to go back and find out."

The controls are offputting at first, but once you adapt to them it feels nothing short of natural. It's worth playing through each level with a friend, laughing all the while, then exploring them by yourself. My personal tip? Try EVERYTHING. Exploit the physics, skip half the game, blow yourself across the room using electricity. Buy this game, you won't regret it. Not for $16.99"

The boats of the water level were absolute crap to use, I ended up using about 15 minuttes to get a god damn boat INTO THE OCEAN... and then they expect you to ditch it, for another.The factory is a single path, allowing no fun, nor creativity. The first half is ""PUT WIRES INTO SPECIFIC SOCKETS"", but after that part was over, that was it, no more wires. Instead you get driving with horrible controls... ""Psh how bad can it be?"" you might ask. Well imagine playing surgeon simulator... with a car... with the possibility of faling out of the world and having to start over.Overall the part of the game that was in the beta was great, but the full game COULD have been a masterpiece if the last two levels were not so boring, and rage iducing.EDIT: I had another go at the game. I got the boat in easily this time. there could have been a clue there though. Like an abandoned, broken ship which has the log infront of it.On the Power level, I managed to climb out of the first room, then grab onto a wire (which was stupid and I loved it!) and I simply took the statue's box. This made the level fun for me. still dont like the driving though.After all this, I say: Try it if wierd controls don't bother you. Its a unique experience with ballsy controls (like surgeon simulator)."

Puzzles are simple and you can take many routes or explore or do whatever you want. It's open enough you can just play around and goof off. I found it relaxing.

,Recommended,477160,33598441,Posted: 16 July,all,Masem,"I was only able to play this though single-player, though have seen videos of the co-op play, and would agree with many other reviews that this is the way to go. The game's controls are far enough in the frustration side that for single player would lead to controller throwing would make for good laughs with a partner. While the game can be readily compared to Octodad in terms of concept, the game does have a number of puzzles that require preciseness and timing that Octodad did not require. Add that the camera is an essential part of the controls, and it can make for frustration.Given all that, the game does a great job of presenting physics-based puzzles with a lot of good visual hints to guide you to the solution. There are not too many repeated puzzle elements, though when there is repetition, it is part of a learning scaffold to help you on the complex puzzles.  Not all the puzzles are straight forward, and some require experimentation -- and that's where the control frustration can set in - but most puzzles are reasonably self-contained in their own areas, so you can quickly come to the right solution. Checkpoints are frequent enough to not be a game-stopper.It is not a bad puzzler, and outside of the control scheme issues, it's definiely a few hours of some good thoughtful challenges. Just be prepared to take a few breaks to avoid mental wear from the game."

I was genuinely shocked.Until I started reading the reviews.This is a great puzzle game with marvelously consistent physics compared to alot of modern titles, and every level is a great little sandbox that lets you solve it your own way.I thought each puzzle was pretty easy, although apparently that's not the case for everyone. Although for a number of the puzzles I saw the way they wanted me to do it, but then I solved it a much easier way with previously given parts. (on the energy level, just take the batteries with you everywhere)Or if you want to spoil all the fun, you can just swing-climb up every wall in your way and beeline to the exit of each level.So yes, with a great sandbox, you can't force the player to solve every puzzle.I just want to say that there is an unbelievable amount of polish, attention to detail, and cool additional features that they didn't need to do, but that I appreciate.Implementing dynamic shadows for light sources of different colors, which is only used in optional level sections. Carefully making every edge and hitbox work seemlessly on all surfaces.Not to mention the level design that just encourages you to fool around; I spent 20 mins using the catapult to knock over all the stonehenge structures.Overall I really enjoyed the experience, and I would recommend this game to anyone with a bit of time to kill and just wants something relaxing and fun.TL:DRIt's fun, unless you're dumb."
76561198046128011,Recommended,477160,31751905,Posted: 14 May,all,SF_B16B34R,"Very creative and intuitive controls. You're an average person with no special skills; you can run, jump, grab, push, pull and that's about it but that's what makes the game so creative. Every single action is manual, which means you shouldnt expect Assassins' Creed style climbing (hold this button and push analog stick that way). Your right trigger and analog stick controls your right hand, and your left trigger and analog stick controls your left hand, and you have to really think about every single button you're pressing and the exact timing to perfect climbing up the simplest of things. It's easy to understand but diffiult to master. Whenever you ""fall flat"" (and it will be often), you'll be frustrated, but at yourself and not at the game, as the controls are quick and responsive so you've got noone to blame but yourself. If you've played ""Gang Beasts"", it's basically that but better, with more things to do, and a ""story-mode"".Open ended level design means there is not one way to approach a situation, and leaves much to the imagination. You can pull levers, push buttons, drive vehicles, scale walls, leap gaps, row boats, pole vault rivers... the list goes on and on. If you can imagine it, then you can do it, it's all up to you as a player to pull it off with the controls that you are given. There are no ""missions""; you're thrown into a world, and you just explore but you know which general direction you should be moving towards. The way the levels are designed is methodic and step-by-step without holding your hand too tightly.The possibilities are even greater in co-op, as you can interact with each other in ways that many games have explored but not perfected. You can climb, push, pull, throw, ride, tackle, save, and kill other players and it's mad fun. Something as simple as rowing a boat can be so exciting, chaotic and hilarious.I bought this game (and completed it) when it was still in Early Access. I played through the whole story with my girlfriend so I definitely recommend you play with another person too as that's where it really shines. We absolutely loved the game and she was surprised to hear that, at that point, the developers had not yet finished the game. I haven't played since, and I'm sure it could only have gotten better, and that is a large, large statement, as this game was already very, very good. Will come back when the free update is released, and if something compels me to change my opinion then I will be back to edit my review, but for now, I'm quite set on my decision.86/100PS follow ""Convert Your Significant Other!"" or CoYoSiOt, my Steam Curator page, if you're interested in finding good games with an emphasis on cooperative play and accessibility to convert your significant other!

Yet what you will find with this game is an involved puzzle game that isn't afraid to try something different. There's no story to the game, you are literally dropped into the game and then you go off and start solving puzzles using your left and right arms.Initially the controls took a bit of getting used to as the right analoge sticks control both the camera and the height that your avatar will reach. But after a little while you will get used to this and it becomes second nature to you. As for the puzzles themselves, they can be tricky, but in a good way. As you enter the level you will find stuff that you can interact with and move around and you wonder what you can do with them to get to the next level. You will jump, climb, move things, control things and more as you attempt to solve the puzzles. Then when you start to feel like you are getting somewhere, you come across a joke from the developers that is both hilarious and cruel!Overall, I find that I'm enjoying this game and it serves as a nice distraction and is both challenging and rewarding as you overcome the environment.

The are many moments where things just feel surprisingly awesome, like piloting a cargo ship, and then using a crane to take a container off the deck.  I actually thought the level design was really very good.Like all good things though, not long enough (although longer than I initially feared), but it does have lots of alternate routes to explore, and lots of interesting achievements.The only thing that got me frustrated was the bit with the pontoons and the chain, but the game just demanded me to keep trying, because you always feel like it is possible.  Got it after about 20 attempts."
,Recommended,477160,33955167,Posted: 1 August,all,Spradley,"Human: Fall Flat is a freeform, physics-based puzzle/platforming game. The player controls a semi-ragdoll character and attempts to guide him through 9 levels.Each level is a presented as a semi-open dreamscape, where the player has to do such things as scale heights, cross chasms and operate machinery in order to reach a set exit point. The game's worlds scale quite well and ramp up in difficulty enough to each provide a first-time player new, challenging experiences. The opening level is meant as a tutorial and is incredibly simple and linear. By the end of the game, the areas are massive with a multitude of both necessary and optional puzzles and variable routes to reach the goal.The aesthetics of the game are pleasing. The worlds are presented as colorful and cartoonish generally, but the game is also pretty and quite easy on the eye. The music is also astoundingly good - as a person who mutes in-game music far more often than leaves it on, this soundtrack was striking in that it never even tempted me to turn it off. The tracks are good, and rather than simply providing a backdrop they often stop for a while and then start playing at appropriate points. An example: the player is traversing up a cliffside and the music has stopped, but he gets to the top and faces a daunting jump to the next area. Cue an intense, epic overture to accompany the feat that's about to be attempted. It really works well and I am impressed by it.The gameplay is simple but satisfying - the character can walk, jump, lift things, and climb. Interacting with objects, operating machinery/vehicles, and even mundane things such as pushing carts and opening doors are presented as challenges. As I mentioned earlier, the character is semi-ragdoll so the motion at times can be sluggish and occasionally unpredictable. This can (and will) lead to unnecessary falls while platforming as well as awkward moments where his body has contorted so strangely it is difficult to correctly proceed. That said, this is not QWOP: it is occasionally difficult but not unfair or impossible. The player learns to control the character and his motions well enough to eventually be capable of quite precise movement and actions. This learning curve makes solving puzzles and completing climbs very fulfilling, and even completing small tasks generally comes with a sense of accomplishment.Outside of the main goal of completion exploration is also fun and rewarding: very few areas in the game are pointless or redundant. Have you ever tried hard in a game to get to a difficult-to-access area, then been disappointed on getting there to find out it was completely empty and useless? That is not a problem in this game. High climbs, cliffs, alternate routes are all present and become interesting to reach and try out as the player improves and replays levels. This gives what would otherwise be a ""beat-it-and-done"" sort of game a decent amount of replayability, as exploring for fun and for achievements is very interesting. The main levels take several hours to complete (I'd guess 3-6 is average, but considerably more or less are both possible) and several more if one wants 100 percent completion. For reference, it took me 10.5 hours to finish the game and get all the achievements.I bought Human: Fall Flat at full price ($15) and I can say with certainty that it is worth it, but were this game to go on sale I'd call it a must-have. I don't generally review games - in fact, this is the first I've written for a game on Steam. But this game was so engaging and so much fun, I felt I needed to recommend it. If you enjoy physics games or ragdoll, buy it. If you enjoy puzzle games, buy it. If you enjoy platforming, buy it. If you enjoy freeform exploration games that give you plenty of fun things to mess around with, buy it!TL;DR: Game is excellent. Get it and you won't regret it."

Then we found drivable vehicles and I was blown away with how well they worked in a game like this. Also I must mention that I haven't seen many cases of bendable (jail) bars in games, that was cool. Puzzles are made to be solved solo but have enough challenge to not be trivial with a friend.We suffered a lot of framerate drops from time to time but didn't notice any bugs during our ~4 hour adventure.

76561198161528931,Recommended,477160,31693013,Posted: 11 May,all,Apsel Friedrich,"A great physics puzzle game. I definetely reccomend it, but here's a list of Pros and Cons for those of you who are interested.Pros:- Very well designed levels, it is clear that a lot of effort was put into making sure each one has multiple solutions, and all of them look beautiful.- Fun, floppy character can be painted and customized, but still has a lot of personality as a blank slate.- Very replayable, due to the ammount of freedom.- Beautiful sound track. Even if you don't get this game, I'd suggest you buy it if you have money to spare.- Very few physics glitches.- fun even without multiplayer.Cons:- After the first few levels, a more ""suggested"" path becomes clear, and sometimes the levels feel more like trying to put things together with your floppy arms than a puzzle, for an answer is immediately clear.- Vehicles are more frustrating than fun.- It seems like less effort was put into the last level, the ends of lava rivers can be clearly seen if you fall off the map, and falling into lava doesn't make you instantly respawn, you just fall through it. No real affect on gameplay though.- The soundtrack doesn't seem to loop, once it's done, it stays done for a while or until you get to the next level.All in all, a great game with only a few issues. Somewhat short, but if you'd spend $10 to go see an hour-and-a-half movie, $15 dollars is a great price for a week or two of a great singleplayer game."

,Recommended,477160,31890138,Posted: 21 May,all,CharlieBrownTV,I recently just got this game to play with my 5 year old son for his birthday. We love split screen and local coop games so I wanted to leave a review here for anybody who was on the fence about this game!  We finally beat the game recently together!Gameplay: 9- From the start it was extremely easy to drop in 2 players for some local coop. This game is filled with various physics based puzzles where you are required to interact with the environment in logical ways to find a way to the end. There seems to be multiple ways to complete the levels which leads me to believe ther are tons of secrets to find! We also LOVED the customizable characters which were not in the game from the start so I hear. The game is great for local coop because when you get too far ahead it will teleport the other player to your location which was super helpful for progressing through the game with a toddler.Controls: 10- Charlie is only 5 so he is not completely capable of handling a mouse and keyboard setup yet but is vey skilled with an Xbox One controller. This game was perfectly suited for the controller and has very intuitive controls. Charlie had it figured it without the first couple of minutes and the game did a great job of introducing the more complicated mechanics slowly as you progressed.Story: 9- The narrator is great in the training videos; I love sarcastic tutorial videos and narrators. It allows for some fun dialogue moments where the narrator has awareness that the game is being played by somebody through the monitor. It gives off a vibe similar to Portal and The Stanley Parable so far! The world is full of mystery and not much was explained at the start which adds to our curiosity of everything around us.Graphics: 9- Low polygon artwork is a particular favorite of our family! I feel like this game in any other art style would not be the same and would take away from the world. Low polygon artwork pairs well with the developer's world and gameplay mechanics based around physics.Overall: 9- HIGHLY RECCOMEND for anybody looking for a splitscreen experience.  There are very few that are fun and work well lately and this is one that does everything right!Here is a link to our gameplay video for anyone looking to see some actual game footage:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svE4zAlywDc

After the first two maps, I invited my friend to play with me, and maaaan, those times are worth everything. So what I  really want to say, that the true magic of the game is the co-op. That you figure out what to do, you help each other, and you laugh at the physics or movements.Overall I really did enjoy the main story, and there are a lot of achievements too, which look really challangeing. I suggest this 100%, but try to play it co-op."

Anyone who is capable of pushing a freight car or surviving a 300 metre fall onto a stone clearly has superpowers.But it's not Bob's apparent superpowers that make the game fun. What makes the game fun is the fact that you are given literally nothing but your own two hands and the aforementioned 'tools', and you have to use them to solve the puzzles you are put before. For every puzzle, there are multiple ways to go about solving it, and trying them all lasts for a long time.Or you could just climb across the bottom of the map (This is actually possible)So, just get the game.

Want to climb a ledge? The camera zooms into a face-first POV that then confuses your next set of actions resulting in the cause of many, many deaths. I used a controller for this game and the thumbsticks somehow control the camera and the humans arms at the same time and it is downright rage-inducing.The controls leave something to be desired as well. The human acts as if he has had one too many beers and stumbles around and doesn't exactly do what you are telling him to do but does that action very closely which leaves room for many errors. This become an uphill battle when you are required to make simple ""platform-esque"" jumps and the human makes a half-hearted attempt and thus puts you back at the beginning of the puzzle. I shouldn't have to redo a portion of the game because the built-in controls are not doing what I want them to do.I *HIGHLY* do not recommend playing this (if you decide to) in single player and go for local co-op as the tasks get exponentially easier with a second pair of awkward hands.TL;DRIn the end, this games falls into the developers unique genre of ""funky controls makes for hilarious gameplay!"" but because of those controls & camera alone, it delivers something very far from ""fun""."

I wholeheartedly recommend the game for it's charm and unique approach to physics puzzles and level design.Human strikes a great balance between giving you reasonable control of your motions without forcing you to micromanage them. Most of the time Human does what you expect, and the times it doesn't have more to do with learning what works (e.g. how to weild poles).The level design harkens back to a time when games were far more varied. Yes the way you interact with each level is mostly the same, but very few set pieces are reused between levels keeping what would otherwise be a very tedious game more or less consistently interesting.The achievements in the game also do wonders for the engagement with the game. Some are super easy, some are very vague, but they keep the game from becoming a simple ""flop across the map"" experience.If you approach Human from the perspective that each level is a small sandbox and not a finely tuned experience I feel you'll get a lot more value out of the game. Be prepared to♥♥♥♥♥♥around, launch yourself from catapults, find alternate routes through a level, and get super frustrated by poles."

,Not Recommended,477160,31759905,Posted: 14 May,all,generallyinappropriate,"In Human: Fall Flat, you control a character who is either extremely drunk or just learning to walk for the first time.Your character is almost always in motion. Moving the mouse to change your view will cause the character to point its entire body in that direction, causing you to fall off of whatever ledge you were standing on. If you are standing on an incline, you will slide down that incline unless you hold down a key to keep yourself moving in the opposite direction.This wouldn't be such a terrible shortcoming if the game didn't require you to use fine motor skills to accomplish tasks at every turn. Feeding a wire into a hole. Hooking four small hooks (on chains) onto the four corners of a shipping container. Driving a forklift with one hand on the steering wheel and one hand on the throttle. Pull starting a generator.This game is incredibly frustrating to play. The puzzles are only difficult because the main character is difficult to control."

Presently I've completed one playthrough of the game and probably spent about an hour in the customization menu because the system is fun but aside from that system the game takes about 2 hours to complete and has some replayability. Due to it having wacky physics it's worth multiple plays through because that allows different solutions and experiences. The customization is basic but fun. The whole system for editing your character is just painting so that means your character can have a load of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on him. I'll admit yes that last two levels were a bit tedious but nevertheless I still enjoyed them just as much as the previous levels. So unless you're someone who's all about the ""next gen graphics"" and all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t then you should check this out.

In addition to that, some of the later levels are tiresome to play, as these tend to involve tedious tasks that only seem to exist to make the level longer, not to challenge the player. Furthermore, driving vehicles is a pain because of how imprecise the controls are. My main issue with this game are the sometimes awkward controls, which is why I can not recommend this game. If you are interested in it though, I suggest that you grab it on steam sale and bring a lot of patience with you."

Timing jumps perfectly, swinging like tarzan, hurling yourself through the air like a damp washcloth waiting for an impact to stick to any available surface, operating vehicles and machines with the dexterity of a moose. Well maybe not the latter two but at times this game is unforgiving. Spent 5 minutes scaling a vertical wall, let go with the wrong hand, start again. Spent ages rowing a boat (painful until you get the motion right) but slipped overboard, start again.My only problems are the length of the game (depending on play style and how quickly you get the controls), it lasts maybe 5-6 hours max (my play time is 2 run throughs and some split screen). Additionally, the last level feels a little unfinished, repetitive power based puzzles, when in previous levels you were solving varied challenges (physical skill, logic, creative thinking).A fun customise feature lets you put your face on your character via webcam but you can also paint them to look however you like.Great foundations of a game, can't wait for the workshop to expand this game further as it's a little short still for the full price. I think the public will add some great levels, new machines and great experiences. I hope the developers continue to do this too."

The puzzles are fairly intuitive but the art style and physics make for a fun engine. There's some object penetration bugs but it's kinda to be expected from a game like this. Initially I critiqued that there really isn't more than one way to get through the game and this was wrong. To clarify: There's only one real solution and method to the individual puzzles. The fact that it's also a platformer, however, changes what you can do in the entire level. I went into it with a Talos Principal mindset and that was wrong of me.The engine has awesome mechanics in it. Electricity, vehicles, tides, boats, a freaking awesome shipping container crane... But all these features appear only once in the short game. I see no reason why there isn't a level editor and workshop support. It's just a waste. There's so much potential in what's here but so little in the execution.If you play to get to the end of the game then it'll take you 3-4hrs and you'll be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(like I was at first). If you go through the achievements and try to 100% it then you'll get your money's worth. There's a lot of stuff that isn't obvious that achievement hunting help you find."

I had bought this because I likened it to Octodad, and although octodad is similar with it's sometimes frustrating controls, this game lacks the charm and humor I found in Octodad. It's lack of background music also fills the game with this awkward neutral tone throughout and makes for a not-very-fun experience. If you're looking for the humor you found in Octodad, this game doesn't have it. I can however, appreciate the game's simplistic artstyle and partial puzzle theme.

I like and respect that all puzzles are purely physical, and if something works, it works because the physics makes it, not because the designers set it up that you must use object A with object B. Also, the physics is tweaked very well. The controls, however, are just too wonky and unreliable. This might in fact be ""the point"" (as a metaphor for the ""human condition"" or whatnot), but even if it is, it's a pretty contentious one. At least the UI could have been used to improve it, by highlighting the spot each hand will hit for instance, but it doesn't. Also, a manual save option could have helped a lot, and I see no good reason for not having it (apart from engineering costs). Overall, it just gets frustrating more often than it should.Length-wise, I don't think it'stooshort. You can spend a lot of time fiddling with stuff, and there are pretty  large skippable sections (which you can literally walk over; on the last level in particular), so you can speedrun if you want, but you don't have to, and the game doesn't encourage that."

The entire game is different-colored default Unity textures. A large number of programming issues have been left in as 'quirky physics game charm', but make simple tasks such as walking up stairs require jumping 50% of the time. This is all disregarding the main sin of this game - tying the arm movement to the camera direction. This means for anything important, such as positioning your character to swing side to side while hanging from a ledge or carrying large things up stairs, the camera has to be in a highly inconvenient position, preventing you from acting normally. Not to mention the physics are just wrong - hold up a long plank off-center, and the shorter end will drop instead of the larger.This game is not finished. You did not earn my money. Take it back, FINISH the damn thing, and re-release it."

However, the controls are just terrible and make it more of a fight with controls than the puzzle. I tried multiple times to configure the keyboard and mouse such that it would be more normal response and feedback. It never could be achieved. The mouse is super sensitive, 2mm of movement in any coordinate moves the view on the screen to the maximum angle in that coordinate. Example, move the mouse 2mm up and the screen will look at the ground. This is only half the problem. The keyboard response is always delayed by 2 seconds. So it makes it much hard to time jumps and everything else. This game feels like the controls are drunk in response and thus unplayable."

That point came for me in Level 7 where you first encounter a giant slide that you have to use to cross a gap.  I was able to cross it once in about 50 tries.  At that point, it's not based on skill, it's based on your luck at getting that perfect set of physics variables right that you get enough momentum to get close enough to the other side with enough horizontal momentum to still allow you to grab and rise up onto the other side.When there's challenges like that which are so biased towards luck rather than learned skill, it's time for me to uninstall a game.  I just don't have enough time in life to waste on something that won't allow me to pass things like that with learned skill after a period of time.I'll uninstall it after this review."

It's so weird that you can only see one small part of the scene all the time. e.g. When you move stuff, you can only look up!The little guy cannot even stand still on a small slope when I was trying to finger out what to do next!#2The auto checkpoint is seriously unreasonable!Reviving on a different map? It happened dozen of times!You cannot save the game progress! If you messed up, you can only go to last checkpoint (without change anything but your location) or restart level!#3You cannot run!If you always messing up (because of its suck control), it will waste a bunch of your time on repeating and repeating ...In some situation, the distance between the items are longer than regular, you can only make that jump in a very precisely calculation (you will try many many and many times).#4I don't know what will happen next!It is good for players to find their own way. But when I stuck on a simple puzzle for half an hour, there wasn't a simple hint!#5One positive: the idea of the game is unique and great!I only finished the game about 70% right now, and I messed up.

You spend too much time waiting for the human to move.  There doesn't seem to be a way to run or speed up the action.   The controls are a bit tedious.   I found it frustrating when trying to look around, the frame would bring me back to the horizon view rather than allow me to fix my stare at the ground or the sky.      Maybe there is a way to turn that off in the defaults, but the pace will still be a turn-off.   I'm giving up and moving on to something a little bit more exciting."

I could play an entire (read: AAA length) game that was built with couch co-op in mind with these play mechanics. The game starts out strong with some really fun and interesting levels where the player(s) must get used to controlling their jello-like avatars through a series of virtual obstacle courses so to speak by grabbing onto surfaces and objects to manipulate their way towards the goal. However, the game is relatively short and could definitely have used more content, especially given the awesome premise and solid execution of what is here.

The game is decently long for the price, and there are many ways to solve each puzzle. I had a lot of fun playing by myself, and with a friend. If you think something will work, it probably does. This game is pretty unique, and a lot of fun. Controls are interesting, and you will get used to grabby things pretty quickly. I strongly recommend trying the recently added FPS mode. Type f p s and then press enter to toggle FPS mode on or off.Note for Co-op: The game is local co-op only, no online or LAN co-op as of right now.

Your goal is to solve all the puzzels in whatever way you can, and make your way to to end of the level. I say ""Whatever way you can"" because they're are mor often enough a couple ways to progress through puzels, some of which are intended, some of which probably aren't. The description of the game was not lying when it said that the game was opeInstead of doing a puzzle the obvious way, and that's were a lot of the fun comes from. There are at times mulitple intended ways to get past a challenge, and some ways to simply cheese it at times. I found myself on multiple occasions climbing and jumping my way accross many puzzels, ignoring the many contraptions that would normally be used in solving it, which in my opinion is much more satisfying at times. The game as a whole is quite the adenture, even though their all some VERY stupid puzzels. Puzzels which annoying because of the physics engine. If you have ever seen gangbeasts, the character you controll is one of the ragdolly characters you play as in that game. The way you pick up objects and climb is the same. This can be fun at times, but it can also be incredibly anoying, especially when you have to carry and/or orientate objects ina specific fasion. Throughout my playthrough of the game, mostly ion the last two levels, I found myself on the brink of ragequitting due too the difficulty of having to lug around and attach certain objects to one another, and operate the occasional veichles that show up (The boats were especially fustrating and controlled extremely awfuly, expect for the giant steam boat which controlled ok). The driving segemnts were unfortuanately never that fun because of it. This can at times elongate the amount of times you spend playing through game. some of this frustration though mayn have also come from the fact that I was playing through this alone. judging from what I've seen in some coop playtrhoughs on youtube, having a partner makes the puzzels a lot easier, and most likely a lot less frustrating. So I would recomend playing this with a freind, although playing it by yourself is still fun, just beware of the later levels.Like a Human, this game's nature prevents it from soaring into the clouds behind other amazing indie titles. However, unlike the humans it depicts, it certainly does not fall flat on it's face."

I thoroughly recommend playing this game with friends, but responsible friends, not childish punks like my nephew, but I digress.I loved this game, right up until I finished it an hour or so ago.Now, why I don't recommend this game.8 hours, 4 of which were spent on the water and the following level trying to cope with the absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t layout.The earlier levels are so small and despite being fun, the game itself is remarkably short, with the last two levels I mentioned being the longest and there are many unfair things in the game, such as on The Water level, there are a selection of boats, which I found infuriatingly difficult (with a gamepad!).The checkpoints can drive you to insanity, but among this I found comfort when me and my nephew were drawn to teamwork (even though you can solo this game).When we finally finished the final level we were stoked and felt accomplished, until we hit the credit screen, where I felt cheated, it felt too small and I realized we'd spent the last 8 hours arguing, complimenting one another's performance, arguing again, scratching our heads, clawing out our eyes and then rejoicing once we finally beat the dreaded water level, which in my opinion is very hard to begin with, and needed more checkpoints, it's also ball crushingly long.After you finish the game, to my knowledge there is no reward but the experience of having finished it, I don't usually finish games, but I had no idea I was about to finish it.Performance wise though it was great, only experienced minor lag.I hope they add more levels or do a longer sequel, and for the love of the almighty I hope they let you customize player two and let you change your outfit without having to paint one on, maybe add some form of combat, though I feel that's more for Gang Beasts.All in all if you want this game, my best advice is to buy it during a sale, unless you're happy to part with £11 at my time of writing.Final verdict 7.5/10 (Pretty Good!)"

And while that sounds pretty simple, man... what a pain a seemingly simple task can be.You use the trigger buttons to control your dude's arms and grab things. You'll have to work around the levels to complete some puzzles to get to the exit.The fun part is there's not a RIGHT way to complete a puzzle or get through the level. You can do whatever the game allows you to do within it's physics. Not that it's physics are something gold, it's pretty faulty but the goal of this game is to be funny, I guess. The only problem I've encountered is that you control your arms up and down at the same time you control the camera Y axis, so placing stuff around can be troublesome sometimes.The level design is noteworthy, there's a lot of places to explore, paths to find, even tools and vehicles to commandeer. The graphics are simple, you can paint your dude as you wish but the music didn't appeal to me... it's kinda sad, and doesn't quite fit in the game.Play with a friend and you're guaranteed to have some laughs."

This game keeps surprising me, there is so much stuff that is possible that wouldn't be possible in other games. I keep getting to places where I think ""in the real world, I could probably get there this way, but this is a game, so it's probably not possible"" only to try it and find out it works! It's a really fun puzzle game and there is never only one way to complete a level, which makes it really fun. You can either do the standard puzzle, or try to break the game and go around the puzzle or solve the puzzle in a strange way that probably wasn't (or maybe it was) intended.It's also a great game to play in coop multiplayer, especially if you still haven't gone through it in single player so you both have to figure out what's going on and how to progress. You might also find, like I did, that some of the puzzles seem impossible to solve in single player, so it give you a reason to go back to it in single player after you finish it in coop.I don't normally care much about mods in games, but for this game I can't wait to see what people will create in the Steam Workshop, which is, at the time of writing this review, only available only in Beta.For people who like achievements, most of the achievement are pretty fun, they add extra goals to the game. Trying to get all the achievements will also encourage you to find faster ways to get to certain places which is really fun. The only achievements I don't like (and still haven't unlocked) are achievement for walking a certain distance and dying a certain amount of time.

Before you even get started you have the option of painting your otherwise white blob of a character model (I turned mine into a shabby, angry looking Mario). The first level offers brief tutorial and introduces you to the goofy physics and equally goofy mechanics of controlling each arm before it lets go of your hand and your off to complete the first and simplest puzzles.There are not many levels though each is greater in size and complexity than the last. Most of the puzzles aren't exactly hard and some of the last few aren't so much as challenging as they are kind of tedious if your IQ is even just a smidge above average or you at least look around long enough to see what needs to go where. Nonetheless, each puzzle is unique and creative in it's own way and is made so by it's goofy physics. The only times I ever got particularly infuriated was when my arm got stuck behind my own head!All in all, the game is $15 and it took me 4 hours to beat it, and that includes the moments that took a quite a bit of time for me to figure out what I needed to do. So take that as you will, I guess it depends on how much puzzles games are worth to you.

You will climb ledges, drive heavy machinery, ride rafts, repair and activate devices, throw rocks with a catapult and swing across chasms, while exploring castles, caverns, shipwrecks and more. There is never a shortage of clean, easy fun.Figuring out puzzle solutions is generally uncomplicated with a simple observation of what's available around you – the challenge resides in the finesse of your execution. Wonky physics can sometimes make it difficult to perform simple tasks, especially in the ""Water"" level where you'll respawn more than anywhere else with the need to redo small sections.Elsewhere, respawning when you fall down is usually trivial since it sends you right back where you left off, everything else untouched.The game has pleasant audio and minimalist art style, fun easy controls, short humorous instructional videos. Some genuinely interesting achievements provide fun additional challenges. Plays best with a game controller.

But 2 things, while the levels may seem too long at 1 hour, I honestly feel they dont overstay their welcome. Each Level will have you do many, MANY, things and theyre all fun and unrepetative, so it doesnt feel tedious completing a level in terms of how long the level is. But that still caps at around 12 hours to finish the game I would say, which you could complete in a day if you wanted. But the catch it there is workshop support on the way so there will soon be an endless supply of levels, but for now, even at 10 levels, the game is still worth getting now.Each Level Is Built Amazingly Well And Are A Blast to play. Each Level will have you face many challanges to solve the problem thats thrown at you and you use physics to solve them and its fun. Its so fun solving these and with them feel refreshing you should never feel the levels are tedious. Also Each Level Has Little Secrets you can find and do and some fun extra paths to go which may be more difficult but are awesome and feel fun. Hell, you can even skip sections of levels if you find the right place, and I dunno if they were intentional or not, but it makes you feel quite badass when you find them.The Game Also Has Local Multiplayer, and I will be honest with you, If you wanna have the absoulte best time with this game, Play it with a friend on the first playthrough. The Game Is still fun by yourself, but with a friend, it becomes one of the best multiplayer experiences i've ever had with my friend. While if you guys love being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to each other you can do that, You can work together and do many crazy things and its so much fun. [/spoiler this is a spoiler for the last level, but on the last level you are able to drive a car to get some coal, and me and my friend fought over driving the car for about an hour, and it was so much ♥♥♥♥ing fun, we kept pulling eachother off and trying to take over the car, it fell off the edge a couple times, we both tried to use the steering wheel and the acceleation, i dunno why it was so much fun, but damn that was a good time. also i found this torch and i suggested maybe it lights up the coal burners so i did that, and it worked, and we laughed so hard about that.]And Thats My Experience Of Human: Fall FlatWhile The Game May Not Be Perfect with it feeling just a bit short, I could never say i dont like this game, This Game was a Great time, and its even a better time with friends, So if you have a friend to come to your house and need somthing to play, Get Human: Fall Flat, and trust me you will not regret it. This was honestly one of the best games i've played recently, and with the workshop coming, Im hoping to spend a lot more hours on it with my friend having the time of our lives."

Well-designed puzzles with interactive and destructible environments and a healthy dose of the prerequisite humor needed to lampshade the shambling activities of the doughy protagonist. The visuals are very pleasing to the eyes.The local co-op works very well and the game is really a lot of fun and laughs with a friend. Some option to individually customize player controls and appearance would be useful, but it sounds like the devs are planning to address this soon so it should be a non-issue then. The character painter is a nice feature but a little glitchy still, this is a feature in progress.All in all a solid game, maybe just a little short on content for now.

Which is about to get better, as you'll get more indepth customization soon.Incoming workshop support (More player created levels incoming).Overall fun gameplay.CONS:WIsh there were more levels and they were longer, but as i mentioned before, there is workshop support coming soon."

It's fairly simple and straight forward, but has some complexities that make it an addicting experience.The levels are solvable in a variety of ways. I've managed to skip huge portions of levels by taking shortcuts the devs probably didn't even account for...and that's part of what makes it so great.Would definitely benefit quite a bit from a level creator, or workshop support. Might I also suggest a PVP arena mode. I think wrestling matches in this game would be hilarious."

,Recommended,477160,33240391,Posted: 4 July,all,Seven,"TL;DR Great puzzle game, Tomb Raider 1-like controls, very satisfying puzzle-solving, 50/50 level designs, a bit short in terms of length and levels available. Buy it when it goes on sale, though its SRP isn't half-bad if you're planning on playing it with a friend.=============================Finished it in ~6 hours on my own (without exploiting the wall-climbing mechanic), not because it's easy, but because I tend to just focus on a game when I have free time.Human: Fall Flat is what you'd get if you mashed Gang Beasts's mushy character model (and some of its control mechanics) and Tomb Raider 1's controls scheme, assuming you were born around the time it first came out. It's mostly a puzzle game, but the challenge isn't just in solving the puzzles; it's pulling it off.One of the main challenges (or draws, if you're not into this kinda thing) of the game is the control mechanics. You grab things with your left and right hands using the LMB/RMB respectively. Add to that the fact that you need to actually ""look"" in the direction you want your hands to lunge towards to and you'll either get annoyed the first few attempts of learning how to work it. While the camera *does* zoom in on your player character when you hold any of the mouse buttons, it doesn't lower your character's opacity, so it's a bit of trying to flail around your flappy ragdoll arms as well (and sometimes they can get stuck on your own body too.)It gets more interesting when some of the puzzles require you to think beyond the usual ""grab this and drop it here"", since some of them actually have you operating vehicles (which are surprisingly fun to operate even on your lonesome) and catapults (which you actually wind down and trigger manually), as well as breaking walls or windows with objects lying around.There is no ""one"" way of solving a puzzle or finishing this game. I believe I skipped out on some of the puzzles, not because I used the parkour exploit (yes, you can climb walls if you take the time to learn the mechanics enough), but because some of the puzzles i solved ended up with an object that helped me climb over a wall without having to ""cheat"" the climb. It's great, though some end-level bits were clearly designed to force you to go through certain doors (especially the first few levels).The main ""fun"" aspect of the game is in solving the puzzles, as well as actually succeeding in pulling off whatever it is you need to do. Nine times out of ten, you're wrestling with the camera and your floppy ragdoll body, and depending on your temperament and willingness to succeed, this may or may not be obnoxious and detrimental to succeeding. Actually being able to grab onto that ledge while jumping off a falling pillar and expecting yourself to fail is immensely satisfying, as the ""physics"" puzzles tend to increase in terms of variety as the levels progress. Again, you can skip some of them, but where's the fun in that?In its current state, it's hard to recommend it at its standard price point. Unless you're planning on playing with a friend locally (no online as of writing), it might be advisable to get it during a sale (which I did haha). It's technically a ""finished"" game, but it somehow felt a bit lacking. Not sure how to put it, but I feel like it's the lack of levels that's holding this game back, as the controls and feature list is already quite sound.It would be great to see more games like this where the player is given freedom of movement to this degree, without making it too easy for them to navigate the whole map. It was a refreshing experience, though I might just be a masochist for games that sacrifice standardized mechanics for new ideas.9/10 i drove a truck by alternating wheel-steering and speed-changing. *THAT* was amazing."

Completed it in one sitting and very much worth the asking price the puzzles can be fairly simple but the game is open enough with its controls and mechanics for you to just break everything and get outside the levels or even make things more awkward for yourself then they have to be.For those interested from start to finish must have taken maybe 6 hours thats with messing up things and just doing our own thing such as building ramps to escape areas or trying to break the puzzles.

As of writing this review, I've only played it single player, but I really think multiplayer would have been a lot of fun too. Unfortunately, It's only local multiplayer.The hardest part of this game is the controls. That's not to say that the controls are frustratingly hard or impossible to use in a semi functional way (like Surgeon Simulator), and it doesn't mean that how well you can ""act normal"" using the controls is an important part of the game (like in Octo-dad). Instead it's a fairly easy and entertaining puzzle game that is made a little more challenging because all of your character's limbs fell asleep one day and just never woke up.I love the game's style and it's humor is pretty great too.Overall, if you liked Octo-dad, thought Mount Your Friends was tolerable, and like puzzle games, this game is for you!"

How about with a friend? If you answered ""YES"" then Human Fall Flat may be a game for you!This game manages to be both fun and frustrating as you attempt to control your floppy man through a good number of themed levels (castle, construction yard, docks, ancient temple, etc). To progress through these locations you need to solve a lot of physics puzzles. Some are easy, some look easy but aren't. Some look hard. Some are just nonsense. But the game is oddly forgiving in some ways, especially when playing co-op, and while there may be a ""correct"" solution to most of the puzzles it won't stop you from getting up to serious high jinx  and abusing the physics system to ""solve"" them in a more...lets say ""creative"" way.You primarily control you little man (who can be completely color customized and outfitted with funny clothes) by moving around and grabbing things with each left and right trigger being the grip of your left and right hand, respectively. Raising your arms up and down allow you to lift and pull yourself, your partner and other objects. Results vary from getting the object to exactly where you want to completely borking it all up in the most hilarious way. Add more complex interactions like trying to sync the oars on a rowboat or anything involving a combination of jumping and grabbing allows for a good challenge. The controls and frame-rate are smooth but sometime the camera is a little funky as it tries to deal with intervening objects as you flail your little man around.I won't go further into the types of things you can do in Human Fall Flat as a lot of the fun is finding those interactions for yourself. Safe to say that there are a LOT of different ways of interacting with the world and objects that can be used. Or misused. Or be broken. (Also water can sometimes be a real pain in the butt - grrrr). Regardless even the screenshots I used here (from the developers website) almost show to much.There is a checkpoint system where if you fall off the world it resets you to the start of the puzzle that works most of the time, it can be a little frustrating in the longer stretches when you take a tumble near the end. In co-op it is a little more forgiving as long as one person reaches the checkpoint the other can use it as well. The method of reaching the check point as you fall is clever too as you just keep falling back to the start from where you fell off without interruption as if the world is one big wrap around.I really like minimalist art style of the both the world design and the color pallet used. It is clear and easy to read as well as nice looking. The design of the world is both strange and humorous with a number of little gag bits added for fun.I really enjoyed my time with Human Fall Flat and the designers (No Breaks Games) have already released additional content since the game came out and hopefully will release more puzzle locations and features (as of this writing online co-op is coming soon) in the future. For $15 (or less, it goes on sale quite often) you get a good chunk of really fun puzzle solving game play.Note : I only played Human Fall Flat in split-screen co-op mode so I don't know how any of it works as a single player experience, some of the puzzles we barely solved with the two of us, I have no idea how they would be solved solo.For more game thoughts and reviews please visit my blog."
