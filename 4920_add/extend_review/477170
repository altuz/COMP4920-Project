This does have a bunch of features Xortex doesn't but they dont do much to make it more fun IMO.

Only made it to wave 6 at normal difficulty and I\'m sweating like a pig LOLGood music, good graphics, nice interface and menus, awesome gameplay!I hate bullet hell games BTW, and I thought that would be a lot like it but nope! This is GREAT!Only thing I don\'t quite like is that stuff too often spawn in your back? Maybe tweak it a little so it does happen but not as frequently?Oh, and more 8 bit music please :-)"

You'll love this.It's still got a few rough spots due to the Early Access nature, but it's completely worth the money. A bigger room with more variety of enemies, power ups like homing rockets and a second drone already have me hooked.About the only bad thing so far is you need a spotter to tell you to start spinning the other way since you'll get tangled up moving so much.Excellent work and I can't wait to see what else they've got planned."

76561198040561708,Recommended,477170,23742813,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Notorious P.I.G.,I thought this would just be a worse version of Xortex but I am really into it!  If you like Xortex I would definitely recommend this one.
76561198035202415,Recommended,477170,23248045,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,oversoul00,"This is a pretty solid title. If you enjoyed the Labs arcade game called Xortex but wanted it to be more in depth then this is your game. The creator is active on reddit and is asking for constructive criticism, always a good sign. The game has a solid foundation with permanant bonuses and upgrades, feels a bit like a 3D Gradius so far as far as the weapon upgrades go. I think this game has legs and I think its worth the money or at the very least will be shortly."

It resembles the game from the lab, and lab has better graphics ""just a slight better"", but the wow factor is there too.  I also love how it saves the waves for you.  Great game to show your friends!"
,Recommended,477170,23494243,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,ZiXT,"Yes, the concept and many mechanics are borrowed liberally from Xortex, but this expands on it to make it a more replayable gameChamber 19 encourages moving around your playspace to a greater extent than does Xortex.  There's a good variety of different enemy types, and the waves can get quite challenging.Xortex seems like a tech demo/minigame, while Chamber 19 feels like fairly well-rounded casual game.Price may be a bit steep, and the graphics aren't quite to the level of Xortex, but still worth it for the amount of fun to be had jumping in for a random game.Highly recommended if you enjoyed Xortex or bullet-hell games in general."

76561198039364157,Recommended,477170,23699245,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,daymaster,"Chamber 19 is an excellent bullet hell vr shooter.You fight increasingly difficult waves of enemies with a ship you hold in your hand, exactly like Xortex. The game introduces new enemies at an acceptable pace, giving you time to get better throughout a single playthrough.There are a few different power ups, some that spawn when enemies are killed and a choice of 4 powerful upgrades after defeating a boss.I like the second drone upgrade, allowed me to score #4 on the global leaderboards.Missile upgrade kind of sucks, I find the missiles loop too much and your stuck unable to fire at targets right in your face. I would prefer rapid fire micro-missiles over the current giant mess that they are. It's very distracting.The bosses are good, however I feel the first and second bosses are far more difficult then the next 2. Not sure how to beat wave 30 though, that thing scared me.I like the new options recently added, the 180 mode is a far superior experience.Just a note that I got major slowdown around wave 27-29 with a GTX 1080, so definitely some optimization is needed.Overall I recommend this game to anyone who liked Xortex."

76561198021222711,Not Recommended,477170,23274826,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,roots,"The game is fun, but very unfinished.  The room that is played in needs a graphical update badly. It was updated recently, but I unfortunately think it got worse.  Now, a large controller and instructions for how to pause the game stay up in the room (about as large as the player) the entire time!  That really needs to disappear while playing.  I don't want to see a huge controller and instructions while i'm playing.  If the game gets a graphical update that fixes these problems, I'll update my review.  For now, I've changed my mind and I don't recommend the game in this state."

It is simple with grapics only okay but the game is fun overall. The waves can sometimes repeat but is no problem because there are always more. In all, this is a fun game and I hope others can enjoy it."
