COUNTERPOINT: It was developed by a single dude in his free time for lulz.YES, you can get through the game by not moving at all and holding the ""Lightblades"" in front of you in a certain position. COUNTERPOINT: If you do that, then you've never pretended to be a Jedi before and you're missing the whole point.YES, there's only the one game mode right now. COUNTERPOINT: Besides the 1 dude comment from before, it's not like he can roll in a bunch of Storm Troopers and Droidekas to fight you, otherwise Disney would immediately sue the pants off the guy and the game would be gone (or he'd have to charge $90 for the same game just to pay licensing fees).So my review is this: It's $4. You can either spend your $4 fulfilling a childhood fantasy and acting like a Jedi for a while and giggle while humming ""Duel of the Fates"" to yourself, or you can buy a Big Mac and feel bloated and guilty for an hour."

However if you're not, there's nothing here for you.The game was fun for a bit, but after I looked at the exercise as a gamer the core strategy is very simplistic. [Spoiler Alert] Hold the sword vertically and keep it between you and the bot. That's it! The gameplay gets a bit annoying when you're tasked to hit the bot 3x and then 10x. The physics aren't quite what you expect as you need to hold the sword tilted right over your head in order to get the lasers to shoot back properly. Also because the bot changes places quickly and randomly it's basically RNG until you get your 3 or 10 hits.The sounds are what you expect them to be, but when tackling the later challenges it gets quite annoying; I just took my earbuds out after a while.From my day 1 playthrough I'd like to see a couple changes to improve the challenge and help me become a true master!2: Change Laser Colors: Everything other than blue and green swords are relativly worthless as yellow, purple, and of course red wash out the incoming red lasers making them hard to hit. That said I had to be a good Sith and use red anyway. Once you learn how to beat the current game it doesn't really matter.1: Multiple bots: I really don't see a way around this. If all the lasers are coming from one location all you'll ever need to do is just hold your sword in between that location and you.I don't really see a reason to stick with the source material after the first few levels anyway. Perhaps you could have the bot leave ""mines"" around with will detonate and shoot you after a set duration. Perhaps you could have turrets fixed to the walls to keep you in check.Also I'm sure the physics do match up, but in the interest in fun I think some aim assistance in hitting the bot would be appreciated; Needing to hold the sword right against my forehead to hit the bot is not fun, or interesting, or even accurate to the source material. Perhaps introduce bullet time as well for some well aimed shots.I really want to thank the developer for delivering this, but please do tweak the experience to enhance the gameplay.Thanks!"

Now, keep in mind that as of the time of this review, there isn't a whole lot of depth to the game andthere may never be more added to it(***edit - There is more being added with an update scheduled for August 2016***). But that's not what it's about.It's about hearing the sounds as you power up yourlightsaberlightbladefor the first time. It's about the smile that will creep across your face as you wave them around. It's about the complete satisfaction when you deflect your first shot back at thedroiddroneshooting at you.Basically the game consists of blocking shots with yourlightsaberlightblade, reflecting shots back at thedroiddroneor dodging shots completely. Again, not a lot of depth but still ridiculously fun, much more so if you're a fan ofStar Warsthat space opera film. Graphics do the job, though to be honest the only thing you're really going to care about is the look and glow of your blades. Sound is pretty spot on. Progression will unlock a few different hilts and more importantly...more colors for yourlightsaberlightblade. My face lit up the first time I was able to rock aDark Vaderbad guyred blade in one hand an aLuke Skywalkergood guygreen in the other.

If this game were made for non-VR it'd probably be sold for 50 cents or less - I consider the additional $3.50 to be a VR-dev tip (which they greatly need, given that the number of VR owners is so insanely low compared to the rest of the market).Anyway, with that in mind, I'm going to review this game as if it were 50 cents.Pros:The blades have a great Star Wars feel to themThe game is a fun thing to entertain a guest or yourself for a few minutes of down timeCons:Not enough content to make you play this game longer than 20 minutes or so.Beatable in less than 10 minutesBlade glow is far too brightWay too easy (if the dev shrinks the hitboxes on the blades and increases the speed and frequency of lasers, this could be fixed)Overall:This game is short and easy, but also fun and relaxing.  It's worth 50 cents, plus $3.50 VR tip.  My main hope is that the developer makes it harder, which would keep me coming back for more.Note:  I beat the whole thing in less than 10 minutes.  You probably will too. There isn't much content and it's extremely easy.  I recommend playing only on legendary mode and leaving one of your sabers off.  That makes it a bit harder, but it's still so easy I doubt many people will have trouble getting 100% deflections."

Great vr controls and great use of the haptic feedback when you deflect a bullet.(Light) Saber colours are cool but a problem arrises out of this.Hilts (From the trailer) are cooolllCONSNot too much variety to be honest, mainly three game modes from what I have found so far, deflect 20-80 bullets, dodge the bullets and hit the robot with the bullets it fires at you. This can get repetative but as a counter argument: This game is only a few dollars/pounds, what u expect tbh)THAT F****** HITTING THE ROBOT GAMEMODE IS INFURIATING.The saber colours are too bright. You cant see the robot with some of the sabers, no joke.THe hilts are cool from what I have seen from the trailer but are too difficult to get with the next one I need to get is from hitting the robot by deflecting the bullets 10 TIMES! WTF! (Please see third con)VERDICT:This game is what it says in the description. Nothing more, nothing less.  While I have listed more cons than pros, the value of the first pro is high and is the most important thing in any VR game. The dev to improve needs more gameplay ASAP and should really not put hilts behind the defelcting bullets gamemode. The value is very reasonable for this game with fun gameplay.7/10EDIT: Saber colours are fixed"

I\'d recommend the dev look at some images on google and try to match the actual movie models. It\'s very hard to see because they are so thick also.Third, the blurriness of the demo. You can tell the dev left TXAA on in the post processing volume in UE4 and also did not set the screen percentage to at least 130 percent (recommened by epic for VR titles).Finally the lightsabers don\'t interact with eachother. I would recommend doing what Altspace VR does with their swords. Allow them to collide and stop the model there when the models touch, but your hand to go through in real life and it\'s fine that way. It works very well. In fact my brain natually just stops my hand when I hit the bar table with a sword in the HTC games room in Altspace.

But sad to say, it isn't. Remember that scene from Star Wars: A New Hope? The one where Luke uses a lightsaber for the first time to deflect shots from a flying droid? Okay, now imagine that again but spread over the course of 50 minutes, just deflecting shots over, and over, and over, and over. Okay cool now you have this game in a nutshell. I honestly don't know where to start with it.My first impressions were positive, and by positive I mean I had to restart the game because literally nothing worked and I was stuck at the ""main menu"", if you can call it one. Now, in literally the first minute of gameplay, you will have already experienced what this game has to offer, which is just deflecting shots over and over and over. It gets boring and tedious incredibly quickly, mainly due to the fact you can hold the lightsaber in-front of your face and practically win. You know all those cool spinning moves and stuff they do in the Star Wars movies when they deflect shots, well doing stuff like that is a good way to frustrate you in this game, as missing to deflect a single laser means you no longer unlock the next difficulty/item. So the best thing to do? Hold it in front of your face and make slight adjustments to deflect upwards of 250+ lasers in a row. Seriously.If you manage to get through all of the main difficulties, the game will then start giving you random tasks to do which barely change up the gameplay. The first one is ""dodge 10 lasers"" in which you hop from left to right as a frustratingly slow firing sphere fires lasers at your head. What did you like about Star Wars? The lightsabers? Well here's a challenge that tells you not to use them when they're put in your hand. Brilliant.The next two are ""hit sphere x times with deflected lasers."" the first one is 3x and the second one is 10x. The first one isn't that hard, but the second one is incredibly frustrating because of how long it can actually take to do. It doesn't help that the sphere tends to move straight after it fires, so even if you do deflect the shot accurately at them, chances are, they'll have already moved out of the way.This is ultimately where I stopped playing, and I don't intend to start again any time soon. I have plenty of other problems, like the headache inducing bloom effects that have actually gotten me killed several times because my screen was coated in white, making me unable to see where the lasers are coming from. Repetitive sounds, no music, no variation in gameplay asides from that one stupid time where you're tasked to avoid using the thing that the game is named after.TL:DR = Don't buy, you've experienced all there is to experience in the first minute of gameplay. Only gets increasingly frustrating the longer you play.My eyes hurt now."

At the time of writing there's not really anything else scratching that VR Lightsaber itch, so if your really just want something else to help you demo VR to people or just REALLY need to swing your own lightsaber for a bit, it's not a terrible buy."

As far as the playability factor, theres not much to it as there is just a flying drone in front of you about 15 feet away and never moving more than 3 or 4 feet from its centerpoint while shooting lasers at you to avoid, but reflecting them is the only way to advance you to the next levels, so in that aspect of the game, its a bit lacking. You can basically just point the tips of the sabers and intercept the lasers with ease on beginner and novice, but on master, the whole dynamics of the game changes as you have to duck, bob, and weave around to aviod getting hit and/or intercepting them , which is actually the goal which can be a mild workout. I found the bouns feature the golden crown of the game. Your in an infinite enviroment ( a very dark desert scene) and you have to constatly be turning around a 360 degrees while intercepingt or reflect the lazers coming from a drone that is flying in and out of you at every conceivable angle from great distances which the goal is to strike it down as it gets close to you doing its manuvers, and one destroyed,  another one appears. My only complaint with this at the start of the game, you can die intantly as you never know where the first drone will be coming from (like shooting you in the back with an instant GAME OVER screen) which can be really aggravating at times but past that, the next 4 or 5 are easily tracable. Youll definitely burn some calories on this mode and I would have to agree with one of the other comments about it being in the grey area between a room scale and standing stationary game. With all things being said and done.....for $3.95. Its one of the best bargins out there even if played just for 15 minutes its worth every penny and I would highly reccommend it to any star wars fan or anyone in general for that matter."

The physics of deflecting the beams could be a bit more consistent, but all-in-all, this is pretty much what every fan of the famous Space Opera has been pining for, albeit in very basic form.It is extremely shallow on the content side. It features four difficulties that consist of deflecting, or dodging, increasing numbers of lasers, that also begin to increase in speed, and come from multiple directions. There are also seven unlocks that feature different colored blades and hilts. After completing the different difficulties, you'll unlock a series of challenges that allow you to complete your hilt collection.The only real drawbacks are the lack of 360 movement, and the limited content. It uses the roomscale to allow you to dodge, and somewhat move around the room, but the droid never moves to the sides or behind; it always remains in-front of you. There is also only the one room, for what it is worth.Overall, I'd say I very much enjoyed this title (what is here), but the lack of some of the cooler potential gameplay wrinkles, and the fact that you can burn through it in less than half-an-hour, would leave me asking you, the potential buyer, these questions:Would you pay $4 to train with a ""lightblade"" for thirty minutes?

This game is great for those who like Star Wars and always wanted a lightsaber.  But this game can use alittle more mojo.  The rookie level is something to laugh at and the legendary can be done with one saber if you pay attention.  Shots come at you slow and most shots can be deflected by holding your saber in front of you.  There is also a mode where you have to survive 250 shots which at first was, I thought, to be hard but with the above comments this was rather easy.Ways I would improve this game would be to:1) add troopers/droids that come in waves. You teamed with a squad that you can control with commands from the touchpad (selecting targets, giving individual soldiers an area to cover, using the grips on controllers as force push/pull etc.)2) make the lasers travel faster. Right now its like playing catch with a 5 year old. And add another bot for an even harder mode.3) this one is being picky but the saber needs to be faster when deployed.  Seems slower that what is seen in movies.Overall I still would recommend it. Its fun and can burn about an hour of time if needed.

I watched some of the movies. I don't really care about the universe... but swinging a light saber is awesome!Alright real talk: The game has some interesting and challengeing stages. Yes they are very one dimensional and there are not to many of them: The Drone mode where you deflect or doge laser shots and the fight against several drones and the robot. It is very fun to swing the light saber around and the sound is of course as you might expect very nice.It's a super small game, very basic but fun. Is it worth a few dollars? For me it was!"

There is only ever one droid and the laser bolts move very slowly, the hit boxes on the lightsabers are huge which meant I could kneel with them crossed and not get hit with minimal effort.The game was very short - there were three (all very easy) difficulties and a few challenges at the end which could not be replayed.The game was boring - the final challenge was to survive 250 bolts and since there's no progress indicator it felt like it was going on forever with no end in sight.One other thing I found was that the lightsabers all washed out the screen making it difficult to see. Perhaps some adjustments to this could make the game more aesthetically pleasing.I am running on less than recommended hardware, and the game ran smoothly. However when using the steam overlay or recieving notifications the frame rate tanked and caused issues. For a game which is essentially a small room the performance is pretty bad, so I imagine this is not very well optimised.Overall I don't think this game is worth the money considering the other games which are availible, and I'd suggest you wait a bit longer until something a bit more carefully made comes along."

Where is the bullet hell version of this where you fight 10 droids simultaneously and the laser bullets move 50% faster? Why does it look faster and more awesome in the trailer? I dont know.Also as the trailerr shows, its just the one room right now, so not a lot of content. (Theres a content update coming where you get to fight someone, yay!)BUT this is the closest Ive ever been to having a light saber, and thats something Ive wanted ever since I was about 4 years old, so thats pretty cool, with the whirring noises and stuff, its all very shiny and convincing. And also, frankly this game is quite inexpensive.Hence I recommend it if you want to get your noob-jedi training on.Edit: The desert temple is quite good! Once again those floating droids try to shoot you but the bullets move faster, and you can kill the droids with your saber. You then fight a human droid who has a saber and jedi powers. The fighting animations are well telegraphed by the opponent, but the block/hit animations seem to be more canned than calculated, so the experience is very much one of playing a video game, and not dueling with light sabers.

At least that's what keeps it fresh for me. You can cheese yourself through the game up to a certain point, but let's be honest; that's not why you buy the game. You buy it so you can wield a saber in a somewhat realistic/convincing manner.With that in mind it's a ton of fun the way the game takes you from the basics, starting with simple blocking, all the way to actually reflecting shots back at your target with your saber... or sabers. That's right, you can decide how you want to fight; you can wield a single saber, you can dual-wield them, or even take a double-bladed hilt... if you're good enough. You can pick just the way you want to hold and use them.That brings me to my final point: Everything is on spot in this game. The movements that are possible with the blades, the way they react, a training droid that feels like the ones you see in the movies, superb progression in diffculty with appropriate rewards (saber colors, hilts), and excellent sound design.Don't expect a full adventure (despite the Sith duel!) out of this game, but the feeling of wielding lightsabers and getting better at using them is totally worth the small sum to pay for this game.11 December Patch note:With the most recent update the game has hit the sweetspot in difficulty, where there is a good balance between requiring skill and innate game mechanics to keep things fun. Before, with the 4th of August version, it was really hard to win the Master Challenge, as the training droid would always miss a few shots. Those shots were incredibly hard to catch, often leaving you at 58/60 succesful deflections, which in turn made you fail the challenge. Now the game knows when the droid misses a shot, so you can keep progressing when you skillfully make sure you don't get hit while deflecting 60 times."

Whilst the ""lightblades"" could use a little more graphic and sound work (especially on the sound side), the feel of the lightblade in your hand is spot on. Starting off there's a bit of a learning curve to blocking the practice drone shots... It took me 6 tries before I got the hand of it. I ended up putting one of the lightswords down and dualing one handed as I found it MUCH easier to block shots. Currently all you can do is fight a practice drone (or so I'm able to tell) but it's certainly a game I'll come back to to show others.If I might offer some suggestions to the devs:1. Work on the sound. Particularly the idle sound of the blade vs when the blade it moving. Maybe the sound gets louder the hard you swing. Take a look at some other...""lightblades"" ;) and hear how they sound when they move versus when they're idle.2. I might would also look into tuning how the blades look graphically, perhaps adding different thicknesses and pointed tips. Maybe more fading of color outwards so the blade isn't TOO thick... Customization is pretty much endless here. :)3. I already know you most likely have plan to expand the game but other modes might be fun to play such at wave and waves of walking ""Droids"" or something... you know.. maybe not DROIDS...but....Droods?

Definitely worth the $4, but could be so much better if the devs make a few improvements.Suggested Improvements:- I want an endless hard mode like all the other VR shooters (space pirate trainer, holopoint, etc.).  I want multiple bots shooting lasers at me.  I want to have to dodge, and deflect laser back at bots to blow them up.- Potentially add a super-hard mode where bots can go fly all around you, and you have to keep looking around and deflecting / dodging- Deflecting lasers back at bots seems too hard. Maybe I'm just really bad at it, but it feels like you have to have your lightsaber angled pretty much perfectly to pull this off. You have to angle your lightsaber perfectly perpendicular to your target (both horizontally and vertically perpendicular), and have the laser hit dead center of the beam, to get it to go where you want. Too hard, find a way to make aiming more predictable / easy / forgiving.- New scenery / environments- Crazy idea:  Add a mode where lots of droids come at you, and you have to deflect lasers at them to destroy them, and chop down a few of the droids that get too close.  Could potentially turn into a rail shooter that drives you forward while you mow down endless droids.Update:The devs added the Desert Temple, where you get to fight 1v1 with a Sith. It's pretty fun, definitely adds a lot to the game.The game still needs more content though. As is, you can knock over the Sith lord, and he has a few different striking patterns, which is fun, but not enough content! More environments. Waves of sith lords. Make them die when you strike them.  Imagine something like Holopoint, where an escalating number of sith lords and droids come at you, that could be really fun!"

76561198066003923,Recommended,477270,29049648,Posted: 5 January,all,Duckhead,"This is a much more satisfying ""lightsaber"" experience than the free actual Star Wars Trials on Tatooine demo, although that was certainly fun as well for a first VR experience.It's pretty simple.  You get about what you expect.  If you have been dreaming of holding an actual lightsaber since you could walk, like me, you'll definitely enjoy it.It's all reflecting laser bolts from the drone except for the quick temple ruin mission where you dual a humanoid robot.The sound and visuals are definitely on par with how I hope future Star Wars games will feel."

,Recommended,477270,33435504,Posted: 10 July,all,Acid,"This is an awesome game if you're into fast paced reaction speed combat. There's not a lot to the game, since it's literally just a training module where you block laser fire, or an experimental combat scene, but it's so fun for what it is.It's not what like a lot of VR games seem to be at the moment, with slow motion combat and such, the lasers on the harder difficulties travel at very fast speeds and it really puts your reaction speed and movement to the test. I was sweating hard after 20 minutes and it suited my full room scale setup really well.I would say the price is about right since there isn't a lot of content, but it is pure fun for what it is and something I'll definitely play more than once to see how fast I can get."
76561198090429227,Recommended,477270,29165468,Posted: 10 January,all,Batman,"The dodging/blocking aspects to the game are really fun, however once you get past the dodge challenge, which in itself is quite lacking in difficulty, you are then told to destroy three of the droids by deflecting laser beams. This has proved to be nigh impossible. The desert temple was fun, and I killed the dark blademaster the first time, but then the second time, he would not die. I don't know if he is intentionally made immortal the second time, or if he is bugging out. This has happened three times now. However, overall, it is a very fun laser/jedi blocking game thing that I would generally recomend."

,Recommended,477270,29360328,Posted: 19 January,all,beastygt,"I didn't expect anything from this game and honestly, it isn't much to look at but when you are in VR and you have a lightsaber (i mean lightblade) in your hand...lasers coming at you, it's all that matters...it really is just like my childhood dream of holding a lightsaber!  A little feedback for the dev:  Would be nicer looking if the lightblade was a little thinner.  Also if the handle was thinner it would look nicer too.  It also wouldn't hurt if the handles had some sort of button...How about local multiplayer where a PC player is the laser shooter and they have to move around and shoot the defender? That would be fantastic for parties.  Thanks anyway for making this game, I really enjoyed it and it will certainly be one i ""wow"" my friends with :D"
,Recommended,477270,29495651,Posted: 25 January,all,Agro-Krag,SO MUCH FUN and so much potential. This game is a blast so far and if its developed up with some new ideas it can be fun for a long time.

There is not a ton of content for this game, but I find myself coming back to it pretty consistently to practice around for a while."
76561198347966442,Recommended,477270,29511382,Posted: 26 January,all,aharshvive,"Let me just start off by saying it's definitely light on content, but it's cheap and man is it fun using the saber. Great look, great sound, and deflecting blaster bolts is fun. You can unlock colors and hilts, but mostly it's deflecting bolts from a floating bot or defending from swooping bots and fighting another saber wielder. Short and light on content, but definitely fun."

That way you could just practice....and get into the flow.  with not limit to how many bolts or drones come ay you.Great for morning workouts

A few sections encorage a stratagy where you hide behind your lightsabers passively and that gets old quick.  Other than that, it's a cool lilttle game with a limmited amount of content."

Closest you're going to get to holding a real lightsaber at the moment and the ""weightlessness"" of a lightsaber means that this suits motion controllers more than a regular sword.Is fairly basic and doesn't have a lot of gameplay, but good fun for $4."
