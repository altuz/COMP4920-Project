76561198140299850,Recommended,477310,25333563,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,foofaraw,"(EDIT: 9/4/16. This physically challenged gamer has, in under 2 days, overcome 54 of Space Hole's challenges, most of which I would have considered impossible (for me, difficult for anyone.) This amazing DEV has made the seemingly impossible into the delightfully likely, with the most rewarding of efforts.)(EDIT: 9/5/16. One complaint with SPace Hole may be the lack of leaderboards, but Space Hole has what may be better. After attempting to win a level throught the standard method (but if still failing) there is a ""trick"" built into Space Hole to simplify many levels. And if that technique still fails (no doubt for many capable players), there's a second ""trick"" that basically turns skills near impossible to master for many players, into trial and error for many of the most difficult levels. So the game is still most fun at its most difficult, but a less than master-level player can still use challenging features of the game to continue toward full game completion. A very thoughtful, very interesting, very inclusive method of progression.)A great deal of my computer gaming experience of the past two years has been of the “rolling ball” variety, with an emphasis on pinball. I’ve also played most of the various “marble” type games, to various degrees of success. It seems to this player that most of them are about as firmly based on a player’s rage level as game skill (but that’s likely because I have much more of the former than of the latter.) Then last night I encountered SPACE HOLE.....To paraphrase the Oldsmobile ad, “Space Hole is NOT your father’s Marble Madness”. The game premise being that the player’s task is to travel through space in a ship encased in a glass ball (perhaps a bit contrived…but really, who cares?) Space Hole has over 100 levels, presumably all with somewhere between an obvious and a contrived science fiction connection, and series of environments. The game is broken into sections of perhaps a dozen or more puzzles each. I began the game with three or four such loosely-based environments available, so at any time there are at minimum, several dozen puzzles available. (I call them puzzles, because many/most of them need some degree of “solving.”) They run the gamut from the traditionally expected solid path, to bouncing and bumping from level to platform, to simply throwing one’s self into space, to bounce off the surface of a spinning spaceship, or sometimes nothing at all. (Please, watch the trailer on the Store Page. I doubt anyone will be disappointed.) There seems no end to the amazing individuality and creativity of the offerings. Even the ones that seem to transcend “impossible” beg multiple efforts, just to see the result….and the very scope of “just maybe”.Space Hole offers music by an indie band, Beverly Crusher, and it’s a remarkably powerful addition to the game. This is hard-edged music that suits the game well, and you may find this game, with headphones, truly places you in another world. Though the music (tragically) does not come in a separate file to be played outside the game from the Steam Music menu, the DEV has identified the source in discussions. The Store Page trailer will allow you to explore the music as well.Space Hole offers both controller and keyboard support, but I suspect the controller will be the only practical option, considering the overwhelming need for subtlety and finesse in moving and controlling the ball.Space Hole, at full price, costs NINTY-NINE CENTS (USD), and is currently on sale for fifty-nine cents. The music alone will be worth the price to many players, but this player calls Space Hole one of the greatest Steam bargains in memory. I’m not good at this sort of dexterity game, but I don’t really care. What I’m able to play I enjoy immensely, and I expect to be playing, and then re-visiting, Space Hole for quite some time to come.(Hopefully increased game time will encourage an expanded review.)Thank you.(4rpg-gm)"

76561198040954632,Recommended,477310,25367219,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,Generic Oonorio,"Pretty fun little game to play if you got a few quarters to spare. The difficulty curve get's pretty steep later on and the NG+ mode is a pretty broken but it's easy enough to beat with enough time and exploits. It's a little kaizo in the final levels so be ready for that. There's quite a few secret levels in it that are a little unsettling but nothing ""super spooky"" or anything.The game feels like the developer's first game so if you don't like that avoid it. Otherwise the game is pretty fun for it's price.Also it turns into a super deep avant-garde student art film later on and it's friggin' glorious."
76561198276987293,Recommended,477310,30092515,Posted: 21 February,all,SoulCinema,"This game was challenging, to say the least. It took me approximatley 8 hours to beat the game and get the achievement. Something about beating this game is so satisfying, and it really makes you feel accomplished in the end. The developer is also very active with the community. (Check the discussions for the game, he replies and helps people out a lot.) I would recommend this game any day, especially considering it's only $1. I would probably still get this game and like it just as much if it was $5. So what are you waiting for?I forgot to mention, the game's atmosphere can get a little unsettling. Well, more than a little, the game just has a creepy vibe lingering at times."

Is it the best game I've ever played? no certainly not, but seeing how its made by one person and it has a good idea that plays well, I'll give it a pass. It's not the best looking or playing but I can see the potential here. I would say 99 cents is a good price for the game in its state, The only thing so far I don't like is the starting screen being rather nauseating when looking at it. I look forward to see what the developer can do in the future. Get the game when you need a boredom killer, Don't get the game if you want something extremely immersive or story driven."

It reminds me a lot of super monkey ball and is very well done. I like the gameplay and the level design is pretty good. This is a great time killer game with a pretty good soundtrack by a band that I plan on looking up. I definitely recommend it to kill time and it will probably be my time killer game. Congrats to the creator this is fun and I look forward to playing more.
,Recommended,477310,25316011,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,SteeScribbles,"""YOUGOTTAGOINTHES P A C EH O L E""I enjoyed this game a lot. I also really like how you need to move your sphere along a thin course in order to either reset data, or get an achievement.There's hints of Super Monkey Ball in here, with some interestingly designed courses and an above average soundtrack. Controls are a little finnicky, but the addition of controller support is welcome.Honestly, I went in with low expectations, expecting a sub-par unity asset hell experience, but in the long run, I enjoyed the game, and had myself a really nice time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpfYJO9P7NA"
