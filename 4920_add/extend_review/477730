Check my hours played on EadorMOTBW (700) and you'll see that I have some experience with the Eador series so far.And why am I disappointed?Well.There does not appear to be any grand campaign. There is no day after day long campaign where you build up your buildings and troops from scratch that I can see. First campaign that I chose and I already had access to allies and tier IV buildings and had several tiles already occupied around my capital city. I mean, seriously, wtf?Instead I find myself locked into a scenario, chosen randomly by me, that has a TURN LIMIT.A TURN LIMIT.I HATE those type of games.So far it is the antithesis of the sandbox experience which Eador lends itself to. I like spending all day conquering a shard, chasing down pieces of armour sets, levelling up my heroes to try all the builds, choosing the different troop barracks to field a designer army, different on each shard.This is...refund material.But it can be salvageable Snowbird!For god's sake give us unlimited turns. Give us the campaign format of the Eador we played before! I want to choose shards to fight for. I want to start with nothing but that which i fought for from the previous shard. I want to choose. Do not take choices away from us, ever.....AND, second fight that I had after buying the game  and I had 2 movement bugs; my hero and a tier 2 mob.That means I could not use that troop or my hero in the battle after they bugged out. <facepalm>Only the second fight...."

Other than that the old galaxy map is no longer present, forcing you to play traditional campaigns. Maybe the galaxy returns later, but I didn't have the patience to find out.It's unpolished and clunky and that comes from someone who has played the old Eador to bits. Don't buy it."

It really should not have come out of early access.I requested a refund almost immediatly.  The UI is extremly cluttered, animations felt clunky especially in battle, and the music does not change when entering combat or during any other event. All these contribute to a overall feeling of playing an unpolished turd."

AI is a little too easy to beat even on the most difficult setting, but I don't play games for their difficulty rating. It can seem a bit repetitive and could be a bit more dynamic but all things considered, I have really enjoyed my time in the game and I hope to continue to see useful updates in the very near future."

They forced it out of early release so we could not all request a refund to retaliate against them for being shady.  With this being said, I am officially boycotting snowbird products from this day forward (even if they release the coolest game ever).

Put the combat map back to 8 or even 10, 12 is too advantageous to ranged encounters.  Also, please make the new heroes available on the random map setting.  I tried them in the scenarios and it was fun, but it would be nice to be able to play them using buildings I would actually use in a manner I would actually play.  Lastly, make the new buildings (units) cheaper.  They are not powerful enough to warrant all the extra resources required to obtain.  I can do just as well with the old units and so it makes it less likely you'd use the new ones.  Another option would be to add a unit building at each tier for more variety.If you didn't know, the pointer error crash is around still and since the new patch I had a weird occurrence.  Any province under your control that is in revolt will attack the capital, not the province.  So I had to keep a hero stationed in my capital because I had like 4 places in revolt.  It can actually be used as an exploit, because the attackers were weaker than my defenders, so I distanced killed them, and since it was 4 provinces I got like 4 rounds of battle exp each turn.  So I could power level in essense by keeping my places angry."

Actually some of the mechanics (like turn limits in the campaigns) basically force you to rush and skip a large amount of the content and fun (getting top tier buildings and units takes hundreds of turns). On top of that after playing Genesis and MotBW its also getting stale and the new classes are in general sub par and dont offer anything significantly new. And last but not least its buggy as hell and not optimized. It crashes like a bachelor party and runs like a sloth.I did nor regret my purchase as i consider getting Genesis and MotBW for cheap and i can show my support this way. But Imperium is like Warlock 2. It leaves you disappointed because the base is solid, but not really expanded on."
,Recommended,477730,29811964,Posted: 9 February,all,camelotcrusade,"This review is for random map mode only and not for the campaign.Within that scope, I recommend Eador: Imperium with reservations.  I prefer to play the game on a random map with settings that effectively minimize the AI, creating a sandbox with my own goals.  I like to explore the provinces, gather my forces, build my castle and enjoy an RPG-like progression of power and difficulty.  I played Eador: Master of the Broken World this way and enjoyed it a lot, and I'm glad to say I can do the same thing in Imperium except with more units, events, buildings... basically with more everything.  So far I've played nearly 30 hours on a single game and I'm not close to trying everything I'd like to try.  I will need several more sessions to experience all the new options and strategic combinations.So why do I recommend with reservations?  Just one reason: bugs.  A range of serious to minor bugs continue to plague the game, and whether or not they stop you in your tracks varies with your personal system and whether or not they introduce new bugs with their fixes.  To give you an example, for the first 10 hours of my game I repeatedly ran into a bug that severely hamstrung my combat performance, randomly making my units unusable while they ""walked in place"" during a move action.  Then, a patch later, that bug went away but I had a new bug, an access violation error that prevented me from loading my game altogether.  A subsequent patch (February 6) allowed me to play again without any major issues, though, reminding just how fun this game can be *when it works.*Nevertheless, I've gotten enough fun out of Imperium to give the Devs my recommendation.  They need to get the bugs under control and they absolutely need to stop introducing new ones.  For now, though, I can play Imperium and I'm having a lot of fun.  If that changes due to bugs and it's not promptly fixed I will update my review.Update: Since writing this review I've both run into another bug that slowed me down and gone through a patch that promptly eliminated it.  They finally introduced a wide-ranging fix in the game options to address the dreaded ""access violation"" bug that can shut down a game.  For me, at least, the bug has disappeared.  I've played for hours without any problems whatsoever."

,Not Recommended,477730,30521935,Posted: 15 March,all,Fleshbits,"Another 4X strategy game where the AI is non existant.I cranked the difficutly all the way up, still the AI never came at me. You spend countless hours simply conquering nuetral enemies at each povince around you start point, in an increasing difficulty as you expand outward, until you expand out enough to make contact. Then you wait until your tech can overcome the guards the AI uses on thier provinces and win.I don't thjnk the AI even plays the game at all. I highly suspect it is just given provinces every so often and obtains hgih level guards on a timer. You have no way of seeing its progress through tech directly or indirectly. I don't think it follows the tech tree at all, or builds core buildings. When you take them over, their capital is converted to province only buildings, so you can't verify.It would be a fairly enjoyable game if played multiplayer or if the AI was at least competant enough to feel present in the game. They have a very large number of buildings with various effects to choose from, a good number of units, and a fair number of spells.Unfortuantly, with no opposition aside from nuetral enemies, it just feels empty."

A new team of developers are in place and are VERY interested in doing whatever it takes to satisfy US, their customers.  I play it as much as any other 4X strategy game.  It is HARD!!! Big challenges - but it is FUN!!!!  Many improvements have been made recently by the new team and they are looking to take it further.  Give this game a try - it is well worth the money.  I have oodles of hours, and it continues in the same vain as Genesis and MOTBW.  The campaigns are different - but they are fresh!  The brand new sandbox mode lets each and every one of us make campaigns but to OUR settings - difficulty, map size, number of maps, etc. etc.  And we have this WHY?? Because we asked for it and the new team wants to give us what we want.  So pick up a copy.  You will be glad you did!EngineerKenny123"

76561197991657927,Recommended,477730,33645446,Posted: 18 July,all,MrMuse,"Okay first off I need to point out that you will not understand this game in a short time unless you have played Masters of the Broken World for a long time. This is not to say you have to play the previous game - just that you need to have played either one of them for a long time before judging them. Neither game lends itself to being open to criticism from those who have barely scratched the surface of these incredibly deep and detailed games.Secondly, you have to realise that you are looking at a labour of love and messing with the livelihood of people who placed themselves in a difficult situation for that love and for the core of fans who loved MotBW. Having played MotBW for 130 hours, and fully intending to play it for at least that length of time again, I freely admit that I am one of those fans.There is a point in the early stages of the game where you will meet a character called ""Alexander the Developer"" who explains some of this to you. And then you kill him and the symbolism of that is all very sad. Whilst I sympathise with the plight of the original dev team I have to point out that anyone releasing an unfinished game, for whatever reason, deserves what they get. It's time developers realised that the old system of pushing out a game in that state just to meet publisher deadlines with the mindset of ""we can patch it later"" just isn't going to fly..and bad reviews and/or getting sacked should be the EXPECTED result.Imperium has all the markers and potential of a world beating game. It is still being updated regularly and continues to improve. It still has MINOR issues and MINOR bugs. It should absolutely not have been released before now. Now it is a fully playable and enjoyable, if unpolished, game. The graphics are an improvement over its predecessors, the artwork is beautiful, the gameplay more complex, and the music is incredible (likely the best I have encountered in any game). At this stage the storylines and setting are not as well developed or as fun as those in MotBW and the English translation is pretty bad in places. The tutorial is now extensive. The absence of a promised multiplayer mode could be a deal breaker for some.My advice is that if you get it to play it for a long time before rushing to judgement, to go into that process with open eyes and an open mind, to stick with it even if there are things you aren't entirely happy about.If you can't do all of those things then it is more a case of you not being worthy of the series than the series not being worthy of you.You always have the other option of waiting until the patching and polishing process is complete."

It is an outstanding turn based strategy fantasy game, considering game mechanics, ideas, campaigns, storyline and even graphics, including the developers feedback.Sadly, here comes a HUGE warning: technical state of the game is simply awful, moreover, recently there have been changes in the team who made the game and it is hard to say if for good, though it seems that the new team is trying to carry on with improving the game and fixing the bugs.I hope they will eventually fix the most fundamental bugs and improve the AI behaviour because that is another thing that should be mentioned=computer players(s) behaviour is exceptionally bad."

Dont get me wrong, I loved the old Eador campaign, but having a large map with actual plot to it is pretty fresh for this game. The new units are interesting, though I'm concerned about whats going to happen to the some of the old units. I know you can still get things like swordsmen in the tavern and from recruitment sites, but I might end out wishing I had them over some of the new units available in town. Hopefully there'll be some sort of improvement made to that. I've only played the new Commander class, she looks awesome, has smooth and quick animations which is great in my opinion.If you're not a fan of early access, please stear clear of this game. I've already seen people being toxic on the forums over minute unfinished details in the game or obvious placeholders. This game does need some community feedback though.

I found MotBW to be...an interesting concept, but rather poor execution, and Imperium follows that same mold. The graphics are slightly better, but other than that, meh. Actually on second thought, it's worse than MotBW, because in MotBW you had a lot more choices and options.The introductory campaign is very poorly implemented, with more spelling and grammar errors than I could count. And a turn countdown? WHY? The game's lack of a proper tutorial left me confused and trying to remember how to play from my rather patchy memories of the last game. So I'm trying to remember/learn as I go, but now I'm on a timer? F that. Game is also grindy AF. Save your pennies, amigos, this one's not worth it."

76561198039866041,Recommended,477730,29846298,Posted: 11 February,all,Mabop,"Eador Imperium (and its predecessor) is one of my favourite games. It is a turn-based hex-style strategy game, largely focused around expanding your empire and conquering difficult battles turn after turn. There is a fairly steep learning curse and a number of mechanics that are not explained very well - be prepared to invest some time into figuring out how it all works if you want to progress through the game of the highest difficulty. However, once you do understand how things work it is very rewarding. Always feels great once you finally manage to push through the final ring (the highest difficulty neutral units on the map) and steamroll through the remains of the enemy.This new edition adds a large array of new units, among other things, like further events. Many of these new units and heroes change the gameplay quite significantly from a strategic perspective, which really adds life to the game. This time the campaign is more directed where you are given much greater starting resources - I actually really enjoyed these as they really showcase the new units of the game and force you to adapt to different ways to play the game, for example racing against the clock (turn limit). I bought this on day one of release and have met very few bugs. I do get the occasional crash every few hours, solved with a simple reload.I would definitely recommend this game to turn based strategy verterans. Be prepared to sink a lot of time into it."

I barely made it 5-10 rounds into the game (on my most recent attempt) and I'd already found several major bugs (and that's not counting the UI bug issues that continue to plague it).Additionally, the new heroes are not well balanced with the old ones.  The mix of new and old units leaves several obviously stronger and obviously weaker units (more imbalance).I love Eador.  I want this game to do well.  But it is NOT ready to leave Early Access.  I haven't even gotten far enough into the game to review tier 2 (out of 4) units, because it isn't playable without smashing into bugs every half hour (or worse).Snowbird, if you want your game to compete with other games (that start with H and end with S), you HAVE to do better about the bugs before you even consider releasing.  For all their strengths and weaknesses, I can play entire games of:Heroes of Might and Magic (or Might and Magic Heroes, as it is now called)Galactic CivilizationsEndless LegendsWarlock: ExileSorceror KingAge of Wonders IIII can make it through a game 95% of the time (or more) on every single one of these games, without having critical bugs interfere or force me to exit and restart repeatedly.The same cannot be said for this game.

Funnily enough, I don't think I even approached the end of the massive, massive campaign. Bugs aside, it really was (and is) a fantastic game.If I could summarise the Eador series succinctly, it *almost* a HOMM-like; if you imagine one hex to be an entire HOMM Map. Each Hex contains numerous potential dungeons, treasures, resources and battles.When I heard about Eador: Imperium, I was immediately excited, yet slightly skeptical; Would all the bugs be fixed?Would it use a brand new shiny engine? Would it contain massive changes and alternations of the original game?The answer to the above, for the most part, is no. Yet, I still recommend the game.  There really isn't anything exactly like itand it scratches an itch like no other series can.Eador Imperium serves to deliver the same experience with new additions and with more managable completion goals. You won't need to play for 100+ hours to complete an epic campaign. For some, that may be a bad thing.The develeopers are really listening, and the potential for this series is great.

Having played this game for only a few hours (said I was still playing tutorial didn't I...) doesn't seem to qualify this review as a convincing one, but It sounds pretty sad what Alexander the pirate said about the game engine issues, esp. the fact this game was developed againt their better judgement. So I will  leave my comments on the gameplay to future update and only say something very general about my first impressions about the game.Having played turn-based fantasy-themed strategy games for more than 10 years, I truly love some of the fundamental concepts of Eador, It's like combining Dominions, HoMM and Age of Wonders series into one game, and one presented with an artwork style which I happen to be very fond of (yeah I know graphics are not supposed to be important for hardcore stategy games fans, which I am not). The RPG elements of the game are esp. appealing to me for example the different spell casting rules for wizard and sorceress. As for the city building part, as a beginner I am really overwhelmed by the number of buildings in the game. Not sure if you must build nearly so many buildings in a SimCity game. It appears this design may scare away a lot of people new to the series without substantially adding much depth to the gameplay. I can only guess at this moment that you get a really profound feeling of achievement after you build everything in your capital city? Maybe I will find out later.Of course there are some negative impressions you don't need to play the game for 100+ hours to be certain of, such as the lack of combat soundtracks and glitchiness in the performance once in a while. For the time being I will try to ignore them and focus on becoming more familiar with the game."

I'm really enjoying the game and love the whole take over each province strategy. There's so much to do in Eador: Imperium. You can search provinces for special locations, construct buildings (there are a lot of different types), level up your hero and units, rename your hero and units for a more personalized adventure, learn spells, equip items, and much more! Combat is similar to Heroes of Might and Magic but with more complexity and mechanics involved. The music is nice and relaxing and fits the game. There are plenty of different unit types including summons, there is a random map generator, and there are different game types like sandbox mode. Eador: Imperium is probably the best strategy game I've played since the Age of Wonders series and the earlier HOMM games (before HOMM5).So, as my promise to the mysterious pirate who I met in the game, I have shared my thoughts and I would recommend this game for anyone who likes the Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders series or for people who like fantasy strategy games in general. Eador: Imprium is worth more than the price tag that it has right now. 10/10!"

Players are not able to construct all buildings though and must choose between buildings to form your own custom army and skill set.Combat plays similarly to Age of Wonders relying on individual creatures rather than pure numbers. There are many types of troops, but the only thing that irks me that a majority of them are just plain humans. Heroes can attack and be attackerd while in combat giving heroes some life.Overall i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy game."

Hearkens back to the heady days of Master of Magic,  in that it is an empire strategy game with strong hero/character development. The tactical combat system is fantastic, and exploring the map, clearing out ""dungeons"", collecting items and improving your heros is incredibly satisfying. The game has some stability issues (asits based on very old code) but with any luck the new development team will iron these out. Here's hoping they persevere!"
,Recommended,477730,32362880,Posted: 12 June,all,Karol13,"What kind of a strategy game is Eador: Imperium?For those who do not know Eador: Genesis / Eador : Master of the Broken World:Turn based strategy, with Turn based combats - that happen only at the end of the turn.Both tactical and stratetic map is HEX-based.Source of income are provinces, but that is rarely enough - to build your economy up - you will need to attack neutral places (dungeons) - as there lies the true wealth.True source of power lies in the starting city (starting province). Losing this province = defeat. Building this province up (selectable choice-based, meaning, that building something may prevent you from building something else. Specialization is applied for units/spells/items)Other provinces have very limited options for upgrade and any buildings built there either boost your economy, local happiness or provide strategic improvement (forts)Your main military power lies within your Hero (later you can buy additional heroes)Heroes gain XP from battles (and some rituals - strategic map spells).Can equip items (specific for each class: Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Commander)Can cast spells (tactical = battle map)And are the only way to capture neutral provinces, as well to siege and defeat enemy players by capturing their main province.AI of Eador is pretty high and challenging.Luckilly, this game provices different difficulty options.Compared to previous games (MotBW) this game adds new spells, units, heroes, maps...Compared to Genesis, this game is much more visually appealing, even having much better music.Bugs - I have completed one campaign and did not encounter any bugs so far, but the game is so complex, that I can't say I am certain, there are no bugs at all.Complexity : number of strategies has limited combinations first 1-10 levels of your main hero, when you have access to basic units, spells, and hence limited tactical advantages (also you can select your enemies very wisely - from narrow list, if you want to win)But beyond level 10, you can upgrade your hero, restock you army with higher tier units, and find + equip much more powerful items.Then your tactical options explode and you can nearly double your battle effectiveness - but still avoid 35-40% of neutral enemies.But if you make it up to level 20+, then you can add even more peculiar strategies, some of them built on pure luck (based on items/spells drops from victories or from random-encounter shops in your provinces) - this is when you realize, the game cannot bore you and each new playthrough can surprsie you. Sometimes ina bad way (non-applicable drops, no  good spells and no powerful merceneries - beating the game becomes much harder), sometimes in a good way (over powered item or spell or unit will be found while exploring and you can start defeating much stronger neutral - reaping the rewards / spoils of war like a BOSS)Due high randomness, this game just cannot become boring, but it always will be challenging.If you like to play difficult strategy games, and love good visuals / music. This game is for you!"

On top of that the amount of completely different units, spells and commanders that you can both control and fight against is staggering, and SOMEHOW they managed to make almost all of them meaningfully different especcially when leveling up.This won't be your most balanced or least buggy game ever owned, but for me it certainly is that game that even with flaws gets my unconditional love for eternity.

It truly is an undiscovered gem; A perfect blend of map exploration, combat, fantasy, rpg mechanics and fun, witty story telling. It blends the best from HOMM, Age of Wonders and Civilization.The combat in this game is extremely well done. It is  much more satisfying than the kind of combat in Endless Legend, Warlock and the stacks of doom in Heroes of Might and Magic. It is to me on par with Age of Wonders 3 and above Fallen Enchantress/Sorcerer King.  Hero and troop progression is also extremely satisfying throughout the leveling process and scratches the AD&D itch.The Civ Building side  is better than Age of Wonders because it forces you to make choices on what buildings you want and there are many more building options,  These choices will determine your army composition as well, leading to a multitude of combinations that increase the replay value tremendously.  There are even meaningfull class and skill choices for the heroes that also add to fun in trying out new builds. The province concept adds a nice and refreshing twist from the genre as well. While the game is not without its flaws; the UI a bit clunky that takes a while to get used it, I have yet to encounter any bugs that many have complained about so I imagine most were fixed by now.There is so much untapped potential in this game and the FANTASY TBS 4X games  as whole I feel that it is our duty  as a community that enjoys these types of games to support the developper and the title.  We all talk about wanting a worthy Master of Magic successor and supporting the right developpers like Snowbird may bring that dream to fruition one day....we have EADOR right now and while amazing already I can see it becoming so much more....."

I didn't encounter any obvious bugs in the current version. Just one crash, but with autosave on it's no big deal. AI is much improved, but still not as good as in Eador: Genesis. One of the reasons therefore is the backstab mechanism, introduced in Master of the Broken World. I will never like it. You are continously forced to turn your units around and the AI is not very good at that. Some of the new units fill gaps between the old standard units, which is nice, but sometimes makes them unnecessary.All in all, the game is now absolutely worth the money and fans of fantasy TBS-games will have a lot of fun with it. I consider it definitely better than Master of the Broken World and a worthy successor of the original Genesis, one of my all time favorites. It should have been released in it's current state though. But just remember the horrible, unplayable mess Jagged Alliance 2 was upon release and the legendary status it has nowadays.

In fact, it is one of my favourite games of all time (hence over 1000 hours in it).  I was most excited with the announcement of Eador: Imperium - I felt there would be an improvement of the game which I already enjoyed.  However the developers progress suffered as a result of internal company issues and  the incredibly harsh world of game programming (it is beyond unforgiving, especially for smaller developers) - it was unfair, but unfortunately the reality many programmers face.  I have no doubt progress would have been faster and more significant with a little more patience and support from gamers and management and certainly the biggest factor by far: with more funding (internal and external).  I have waited for the unfortunate internal issues to shake out and I am most happy to see the returned focus on the game... I'm in the midst of returning to the title and plan on getting my Eador: Imperium hours played on the path towards reaching the level of my Eador: MotBW hours.As it stands, I feel that Eador: Imperium is a solid game for its price and that given the proper opportunity the programmers will continue to bug smash and develop the game, which will only further increase the enjoyment factor for gamers.  As turn-based strategy/rpg games go, Eador: Imperium is a gem - if you enjoy that genre, this game is likely for you.Arrrr matey... some landlubbers don't realize nor appreciate the extreme challenges one faces in the life of a pirate!

76561198043898087,Not Recommended,477730,34123735,Posted: 9 August,all,Kaysoky,"I hadn't played the prior Eador games, but I was pleasantly surprised by the concepts and mechanics of this game.  Compared to other games, this has the most similarities to the Disciples series (particularly the third game).This game is very hero-centric.  You typically start with a single hero, and can usually build up a few more as the game progresses.  Like in other hero-centric strategy games, the earlier you hire heroes, the more useful they are, as it takes a significant amount of investment to level them up; and heroes are only useful when they are leveled.  Heroes are also the only units that can move around on the world map.  They are your agents for exploring your territory and conquering new territories.Outside of heroes, there is a resource management component.  The base of your operations is a territory (a hex) containing your stronghold.  You can spend gold and crystals (the two currencies of the game) to build buildings and hire units.  As you build more buildings, you unlock higher tier units, access to schools of magic, different ""rituals"" (basically magic cast on the strategic map), and improvements you can construct in your outlying territories.The core gameplay loop is thus basically:Use a hero to explore a territory, clear existing ""locations"" (places with enemies or quests), or conquer new territories.Fight some tactical battles (auto-resolution is available, but is usually not a good idea).Loot equipment after battles to give to your heroes.Invest spoils from battle to increase your income and capabilities.Repeat until you meet the enemy AI players.There are a lot of things to discover and optimize as you play the game.  The sheer variety of things gives the game a fairly steep learning curve.  But that keeps the game fresh even as you start from scratch between scenarios and campaigns.Unfortunately, there are a few major problems with the game:The game frequently crashes.  In my experience, this happens primarily during tactical combat, as the AI resolves its actions.  (And funnily, it seems to crash more often when the AI is losing.)  The game itself autosaves every turn, which helps a little, but not between combat.  If you need to perform multiple battles per turn (which is very common), it can be infuriating to redo an earlier battle just because the game crashed.  This crashing forces you to plan conservatively and mostly defeats the purpose of having more than one hero.As the game progresses into later stages, territory management becomes a hassle.  Each territory you own can hold up to 3 improvements.  These improvements have multiple stages, but you can only build one improvementglobally, per turn.  When you have few territories, it is simple to remember which territory has what improvements.  But when your empire spans dozens of hexes, you will often find yourself scrolling through a province list or repeatedly opening and closing the build-menu.The AI is basically non-existent.  They certainly don't have any in-game portraits (each opponent is just depicted as a question mark).  As a singleplayer game, you would expect the AI to be the primary challenge.  On the contrary, the main hurdle is merelyreachingthe AI, as you need to conquer all neutral territory between you and the AI. These neutral zones typically become more powerful as you get further away from your starting location.  However, if you are powerful enough to reach the AI, you will steamroll them, no matter the difficulty.  This makes each map feel anti-climactic.On the tactical map, the AI is also fairly brainless.  The AI basically always charges at you.  If you auto-resolve combat, your units will do the same (and usually end up dying).  If the enemy has units that move faster than other units, those will end up charging ahead, giving you ample opportunity to pick them off.  In a way, this reminds me of playing the King's Bounty series of games on Impossible difficulty, where the enemy always vastly outnumbers and outclasses your units."

This game is currently too buggy to be playable. There are frequent crashes where the game crashes to desktop with a frequency of about once every 20 minutes. These bugs are caused by invalid pointers and there's nothing you, the consumer, can do about it except wait and hope that the developer does a better job of quality assurance on their code base. I recommend waiting to see if the developer releases any updates which fix these game breaking bugs -- seriously, wait. You don't want to be sinking 500 hours into a game and restarting it once every 20 minutes."

Eador is a fine game as it works, but it simply doesn't work for long term.On my behalf there is no hope for Eador!I have sent in my savegame 2 times (actually much more times, because the support didnt get the issue in the first line) just to fix my savegame to ENABLE me to continue a scenario I've spent more than 80 hours into gaming and actually testing.Now after weeks I tried to play on with the fixed savegame and there was a patch.Now my best party isn't able to survive against a manticore level 8 (wtf). It kills a transformed high level dragon with 150 hp with one single attack!I really <3 love <3 this game but the developers cannot get this game right.Everytime you play it there is something else coming up as severly broken....Not only broken that it would be just annoying but also often enough renders your progress as lost so you basically are adivsed to start from scratch instead of living with the issue, trying to circumvent it or as I did send in the savegame to ask the developers to fix the issue in your savegame.Well, I've no idea how big the party of developers is, but from the speed of support and development it seems like it is rather a hobby of 5 developers, rather being a professional project.- Once you accidently get heros / party from AI players breaking the immersion and difficulty- There are literally 5 dozend issues causing memory leaks and crashes. Some even gamebreaking.- Easy things like Hydra attack on all neighbouring hexes don't get fixed for monthsWhile this game is marked as Early Access and is under development as a reader you have to know thatthis game is far from being all new, but the base is Eador Masters of the Broken World - bad tongues called it Masters of a broken Game back then already - because also suffering from dozends of these issues including memory leaks etc.Despite my very honest and constant efforts to help the developers addressing the issues to make this game great I cannot stand this POOR quality anymore.It feels like they really do not have any simulators to test basic mathematics and concepts of their game.I am soo deeply sad for the developers of Eador that they keep their strategy to add content instead of fixing the base game first.It simply makes no sense like it is and it is quite unplayable if you have not nerves of steel of want to restart a scenario from the scratch just becausethe game freaks out over and over again.Unhappily goodbye!ːsirenːːSurrenderːhttp://imageshack.com/a/img921/1038/xS7A5C.pnghttp://imageshack.com/a/img924/6190/pcf2c4.pnghttp://imageshack.com/a/img924/2850/rRXBi1.pnghttp://imageshack.com/a/img923/6955/NqGMsV.pnghttp://imageshack.com/a/img924/3626/gGknEH.pnghttp://imageshack.com/a/img921/5720/P6U0Fs.png"

Building your kingdom is tough in the beginning ofthe game. There are many building options and the starting hero is weak, so the options are limited.But with a little patience, you will manage to build an interesting hero with a strong party.Yet, with the exception of very high-level heros with powerful items and high-level units, the gamedoes not get boring, because AI opponents will attack your lands with powerful heros and will keepyou in check. Also, there is almost no way that you will reach this point where ""your coffers arealways filled with gold."" I know of no other kingdom management-type strategy game that does sucha good job of keeping things balanced. Once your income rises, ""unfortunate random events"" willdeplete your gold, and then there is also corruption and the chance of provinces rebelling againstyour rule. So you have to try to counteract all these threats while building a strong army. This is quite challenging,so I'd say this is no game for ""newbies.""Also, the tactical battles can also be quite difficult, either because of the sheer strength of the enemy or because a lot of micro management is required.Terrain also plays an important role - which can work to your advantage but at times (and dependingon the hero and units) can also work against you. What I like a lot about the AI (which is mediumstrong compared with other games) is that it will tend to kill weaker units if the enemy is able to doso. You you also have to watch out for your troops.It's a little bit of a shame that province defenders come in ""generic kits"", meaning their makeup islargely standardized; this can make gameplay tedious in an area where all guards are of the sametype.But the overall design is amazing, there is a good dose of (sometimes dark) humor in the game,and since you ""multiclass"" your hero at 10th level, even playing the same hero type over againremains interesting.If you loved HOMM III and similar games and are not afraid of a high level of building management,this one is for you!!(yes, there are issues in the areas of game stability and the music in Eador Imperium is too monotonous,but the positive aspects greatly outweigh these problems!)"

This game, while I have only scratched the surface thus far, looks very promising. Note that Eador MOABW was full of bugs when I played it after the first level, but I stayed with it (quite a long game actually) in spite of all the crashing. So far the gameplay mechanics of Imperium intrigue me. I enjoy the castle setup, they seem very proud of the number of buildings you can create. I like the versatility in that as well. Nothing so far seems to ""prohibit"" another building which I like, though as a trade off once you form an alliance with a demirace (you can only have one) the buildings for other demiraces provide fewer bonuses. Which means you could play without forming any alliances and that would be just as valid as forming an alliance.Things get really complex, so I better not try to explain everything here, so I'll  say even if you played Eador MOABW  you should play through the dull tutorial. Just to get your barings. I recommend this game if you enjoy turn based strategy and like such games full of lore."

Haven't yet figured out all the mechanics and tricks to this game but I am truly enjoying it, thus I recommend it to anyone looking for a something similar. The journey of discovery is what this game seems to be about.My only gripes at the moment are the end of turn mechanics (the fact that I'm seeing all the players' turns on screen twice, due to the two phases - maybe they can be compressed in a nicer SINGLE animation that doesn't cover up the whole screen) and the fact that enemy ranged units seem a little overpowered in the beginning (but that might just be me not knowing the game well enough).All in all, it's a great time sink, especially on the largest of maps :)@Developers:  if you plan on doing a similar game in the future, do inspire yourselves more from older games. Starting up seems a bit tedious, there is some lack of information regarding some important stuff (e.g. choosing to construct some recruiting buildings locks you out of others + why do my conquered provinces keep rebelling and how can I prevent those constant fights in the beginning?!), yet the general mood is great; I can see this (future?) game become more like FG/HOMM3:WOG in some aspects (e.g. making some items available for units too, not just heroes)."

Have I watched too many ""repeated"" episodes of Black Sails... possibly? :DI'm really enjoying the game. From art, creature, story design and practically every-other-aspect-thing about it. The feel of the game is amazing and words alone won't do it proper justice. Eador: Imperium - you have it all :D (unfortunately some always go back to ""no multiplayer"" and spit on it like it is a really bad game because of it). Sure you can say that but since you start a map (any scenario, mode or campaign) you are enveloped in the game system, art, the ""oh crap"" scenario where you forgot to repair your equipment searching the provinces for special locations and items, leveling up your hero and units and much much much MUCH MORE... than I just wrote! It has THAT ""wow"" FEEL... you know, we ALL get from awesome games (from all the genres) and can't really described it for what it is.  I'll admit that I may have used the word ""feel"" slightly too much but that's the way that cookie crumbles :DSo, I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoyes playing games. High 10/10!"
,Recommended,477730,34469124,Posted: 24 August,all,Golgor,"This game is best played with *you* roleplaying in the background, that's the way it works for me best, and i recommend it :-)It is unique,  a gem in its' own right. A mix between Sid Meiers Civilization 5+6, Legends of Callasia, Endless Legend and Age of Wonders 3. A tile is no longer just a bit of plains, its a province on which you can construct fortresses or villages. Every tile (province) has it's own separate locations within it, e.g a Dark Wood may have ""Dark caves and Primordial hedges""You cannot just recklessly invade provinces, the populace has to be taken in regard, for when they are truly unhappy with their new masters they revolt, you gotta keep em happy with you.The combat happens on a smaller map, much like in Age of Wonders and Endless Legend, and consists of a hex-turn-based unit command sort of thing.The tutorial is thorough, easy to understand, fun to play, and very helpful.There are endless possibilities with the game, how to expand your empire, how to manage it, which path to take.I haven't run into anything detrimental to my gameplay and thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough, even now, im heading over to dominate Eador Imperium.I fully recommend the game to Civ and AoE fans out there, as well as to fantasy, strategy and (to a lesser extent) RPG fans out there."

,Recommended,477730,34982456,Posted: 15 September,all,reikken,"tl;dr: if you like trying out different builds and strategies and like leveling your favorite units, this game is a treat. And there's also a lot of tactical depth to appreciate.One of my favorite things in games in trying out different builds and strategies. And this game absolutely excels at that. There's so much room for strategic and tactical freedom. between which hero class(es) you pick, how you build your hero, which units you take, what buildings you focus on, whether you expand your territory or build up existing provinces, etc. Even such choices as investing in hiring and maintaining large expensive force to conquer strong enemy forces and claim valuable resources, or keeping a small army that can level up more quickly and is more mobile, leaving more funds to invest elsewhere.And that brings me to another of my favorite parts of the game: the fact that all units can level up, not just the heroes. And you have a say in how they grow as well. while most units can't subclass on top directing their stat growth like heroes can (though a handful of them can indeed class change), and they can't be decked out with equipment, they can still grow quite a lot, and learn new abilities, and you can direct their development. For instance, I can grow a fairy from a frail light support unit into a powerful healer that can sustain a small army or a strong mobile ranged attacker that can singlehandedly take down heavily armed and armored mounted knights. Or even a difficult-to-kill evasive distraction. One of my favorite hero builds is an enchanter mage where I pick a couple of favorite units and overcharge them with loads of buffs and level them up quickly. Like taking a basic low mobility footsoldier and turning him into a monstrous unstoppable killing machine by giving him armor buffs and a speed buff and focusing his growth into damage powerups.Also I have a lot of appreciation for some simple mechanics that enhance the tactical depth. Like stamina. very simple, but most games don't do it, and it adds a lot. Most actions deplete stamina, and being low on stamina reduces attack power and mobility, and dropping to 0 immobilizes the unit for a turn and halves its defenses. Attacking costs a small amount of stamina, and moving and attacking in the same turn costs additional stamina. Agile ranged attackers typically have low stamina, so while they can kite slower melee units, it tires them quickly. Many units have access to special abilities they can use for a hefty stamina cost. And moving through difficult terrain also costs stamina. But my favorite part is that it opens up enitire strategies, revolving around depleting your enemy's stamina before moving in to attack while they lack the energy to fight back. Then of course there are all the usual things you find in tactical games such as terrain bonuses and pentalties, flanking bonuses, etc. I love impactful terrain in general in tactical games. It can make a huge difference whether you mount your assault on an enemy province from, say a neighboring swampy province from the east or from the open plains province from the south, as which you pick will influence what kind of terrain is on your half of the tactical battlefield.It is not a perfect game, however. It has bugs that can cause crashes. There is risk of randomly crashing every few hours and having to redo your last tactical battle (it autosaves after every strategic turn). I do not know what causes it. You can go dozens of hours without a crash, or crash every 2 hours. Also pacing can get slow at times. But those are the only real flaws."

Unlike some heavy micromanagement RPGs, this game simplifies all the micromanagement elements and visualises all the important aspects of the game. I played the `Eador Masters of the Broken World` for a while and I did like it.What convinced me to purchase the Eador Imperium, is the fact that the developer believes in this project and in the Eador community, and sees the future of this game.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes relaxing strategy games, turn based RPG and in particullar people who played  `Heroes of Might and Magic` and `Disciples`."

76561198071193878,Recommended,477730,34899694,Posted: 12 September,all,radlas,"I have been playing this game since Genesis (the alpha-version with sprite grapics) and still enjoy it. Sure, Steam version includes some bugs, but they are far from game-breaking.This game is something between Disciples and HoMM, a turn-based strategy with a huge RPG element where your heroes lead small parties of units to war. Both heroes and units gain experience and develop over time (if you manage to keep them alive - however, heroes can be resurrected). You can also equip your heroes with items like in a standard RPG.The key feature of this game is variety. There are 7 hero classes who play quite differently. And then, there is multi-classing, much like in DnD. The number of different units is great, and you choose wich unit dwellings to buld in your capital to make them available for hire. Some units cannot be hired - only summoned using spells or rituals (like undead and demons). You can also ally with non-human races (dwarves, orcs, etc.) to gain acess to their racial units.Likewise, the magic system includes 6 spell schools, containing combat spells and global rituals, and you can choose wich to develop, and to what extent.So, this variety leads to many strategies being available. You want a gunlune that shoots you enemies off the field? You want a shieldwall backed up by healers and casters?! You want a necromancer leading an undead squad? You want a lone mighty warrior hero who vanquishes the enemy while his small retinue heals and buffs him? You want a wizard that blasts enemies with damage-dealing spells? You want an army of rampaging monsters and magical creatures?In Eador, you can do it all (and much else)!And in Imperium, you can now also worship different gods and gain benefits from it.Definitely worth trying if you like turn-based strategies, or RPGs, or both."

If you don't know already, there is a text event where a developer, under the alias of a 17th century pirate, tells you of the hardship the game and the company went through in the last years. Well, call me soft, but it touched me. Indie developers are often on the razor's edge, and having worked as a game journalist I know my fair share of them, and understand how difficult can be their job.Now, the game. I own the original Eador on GOG. Played it halfway through the campaign. It's decent, but it can get tedious because, well, there is little persistence and every map is basically a sandbox. No more: in Imperium there is still a sandbox mode, but there are also more traditional campaigns in the style of Heroes of Might and Magic. And, indeed, this game is very similar to HoM&M, and works like a ""more-of-the-same"" version of the previous Eador.There is a strategic layer and a tactical one, both quite deep. A lot of units, buildings, spells, heroes. It's basically what a fantasy 4X should be, it doesn't reinvent the wheel. It lacks some of the more outlandish things of Dominions 4 (while being far more accessible, in exchange) and it hasn't the visual quality of the the latest HoM&M. But it's good, solid, with a lot of content for the price. If you are a fan of the genre, there is no reason not to buy it."

I like the impressionist art, the ingame graphics, the overall pace, the shard setting.  There's alot of lore and detail and it reminds me of game of old.What I don't like is the pace.  You can spend many, many turns exploring a province and hitting autocombat.  I like that they put in combat, but it feels just okay.I would say TBS games are my favorite, but I find myself being very critical if they don't feel like more fun.   I try out many of them and and somewhat disappointed.  I'm on the fence with this one, maybe I'll play it more.. which means it's above average for the current crop.I did find the Pirate's lament mentioned in other reviews pretty unique.   I bought theh previous games, didn't like them enough but this one seemed different enough to give it a try.  It's better imo, just maybe not for me."
