I can finally live out my fantasy and fight pirates and sail the seas. all in VVV RRRRRRRRG MATEY! now is it worth 14.99? well probably not... and certainly not 20 bucks...but I guess that depends on how bad you want to pwn pirates..:-) keep it up devs!
,Recommended,478950,23487396,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,Wolfret D. Caigan,"This is a pretty fun game so far,I just beat the Easy mode, which is 12 'days'. Each day, you fight a stronger enemy pirate ship. You have a rifle, which you aim with two hands, and a brace of pistols, with one shot each. At the start, you can only take a single hit, and use a power called Focus (basically, bullet time) with a long cooldown. You also have crates you can move around, hide behind, and throw, as well as explosive barrels and other things eventually.After each day's battle, you are rewarded with gold and possibly an ability. You can take the gold to the Shop, and buy upgrades for you and your equipment (buy a better ship with more on it, upgrade weapons, or how many hits you can take, etc)These are definitely important because the health of the enemies and amounts that show up each day increases, and the pirate that took 1 shot to kill a few days ago, might take 3 without upgrading your weapons.After you beat easy mode, you unlock Hard Mode and the 100 Pirate War, which is a gauntlet that saves your highest score."

But it is very hard to look at... the visuals are SNES in VR. The enimies are not animated. Not a lot of effort went into making this game for me to recommend spending more than $5 on it. Usually I support VR games even if its not that great but I am not supporting this one for $15. I will be asking steam for a refund.

We've been getting lots of ""defense"" type games, but V ARRR changes it up a bit (pirates instead of zombies?). While the animations are a little clunky and the gameplay is still in need of a bit of polish, I still found it pretty okay (and exhausting!). I do hope some sort of co-op/multiplayer gets implemented! ...and swords!BUT... Can I recommend it at $14.99, as it is?Eh, not really...  I probably would for around half of that.Check out some gameplay here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvebh4cxp-Q"

While the visuals leave much to be desired, the game does a lot to distinguish itself from the other ""wave shooters"".  You can upgrade everything (guns, boat, abilities), you can create cover for yourself and there are different modes to enjoy.  Give this one a try!  It's one of the deeper shooters on the Vive right now."

The shotgun is acurate if you aim down the site. Pistols are great with a spin over reload. Good upgrades to weapons and aids.For me i think for the price this is well worth it. Especially as there are good updates coming as well.Its one of thoses games which is fun especially if you like the pirate theme
76561197981499035,Not Recommended,478950,23509630,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,LK,"So far this looks like an Early Access title, but released as a full game. I gave it two chances today (relatively short, looking at my play time), however at the end of the day I decided to get a refund.There are games which look bad, but make this up with gameplay. Here, unfortunately, it was not the case for me. Mediocre models, bad animations, really not much fun. Not to mention, some of the options in game look like some debugging-era leftovers, which were never changed into something more user-friendly (switching graphical settings with +/-? seriously? I have to take off my headset to switch graphical options in the game?). I tried to force myself and play the game further, but couldn't. This game needs lots of polish before being worth 15 EUR (not to mention, without the discount it is worth 20 EUR).The concept is kinda cool, the execution is bad. The game feels incomplete and looks like it was quickly done to catch up with new VR market. Maybe I'll go back to it if developers decide to update and evolve it into a better product. In my opinion, right now it is not worth the money.Although I must admit, reload mechainc on the Rifle was kinda cool."
,Recommended,478950,26136537,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,hunt.topher,"Don't be turned off by the rough-edged models and simple graphics. This game is wild fun, and when you're in the heat of the action, it's exhilirating. These shipdeck battles feel like the best parts of Wind Waker crossed with the best parts of The Matrix. The game may be a one-trick pony, it has no exploring or adventuring mechanics beyond the battles themselves (for now), but it does that trick extremely well and I always feel giddy after a battle, regardless of whether I won or died.I do think and hope that some aspects of the gameplay will improve over time:- Loading screens are so 5 years ago. SInce you're mostly just standing on the same part of the same ship, when you sail out for a new battle, why not just have the ship sail away from port? To me that would greatly improve the feeling of immersion.- The challenge island and sword battle are exciting new elements and I hope that they get more fleshed out over time. I'd love to be able to wander around an island and stumble on an ambush, talk with a few different traders, search for buried treasure, etc., rather than simply being dropped into fight scenes."
,Not Recommended,478950,28143252,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,v1k1n,I tried to get into this but everything is so tedious in this game. Having the hold down a button to select is not a good UX.I was excited for the sea battles but turns out you just shoot a couple guys on a boat and thats it. I really wanted to get into this game but sadly I can't recommend it at this point. Maybe if there is a big gameplay/content update I will try again
76561198093694653,Recommended,478950,23531006,"Posted: 12 June, 2016",all,LowlyKnight,"I actually really REALLY enjoy this game.  It feels like being inside Zelda Windwaker.  The lite rpg elements are a welcome addition to the ""gallery shooter"" concept that many devs are tapping for the Vive right now.  You can upgrade things like your health, reaction time (eseentially slowing time right before your hit with a bullet so you can dodge), your weapons and your ship.  After beating the game on easy I wish there was a way to farm more treasure, which can only be done currently by completing missions.  On your second play through the difficulty is cranked up and upgrades become more expensive which makes for a drastic difficulty change. As a result your unable to progress if you've upgraded the wrong way. I am looking forward to the planned updates and really wish there was a way to travel around and focus on maxing out all of my gear and abilities.  I personally am fine with the $14.99 price that I paid, not sure that it's worth $20 as the content is currently light.  But that content is addictive and fun within a wonderful atmosphere.  Cheers!EDIT: not sure why steam labeled me as receiving this for free, I purchased it for $14.99 but whatever I don't know how to change that."

Your room should be at least 3x3m to have space for cover and movement.  Do not expect any kind of story in this one, its really just about shooting around with some pistols."
,Recommended,478950,35017324,Posted: 17 September,all,FastLawyer,"As other have stated, this game does work on Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers.  If you can't get past the tutorial, just remember to press down on your thumbsticks whilst pressing the grab button to reload.  Press A or B (or X or Y) to bring up the rifle.  You have to bring your hands together to reload the rifle, it's very wonky so you may want to press grab too while you do that.  Trigger is the fire button.  To grab the barrels, you just press the grab button while clicking down on your joystick then swing and let go.  Using the focus ability I think is just pressing down by itself or grab.  To set stail you have to put your hand on the sail and then press down on the joystick and then just physically take your arms down.  To get to the shop I believe you simply press the trigger button when you don't have a gun.Anyways, yeah the controls are wonky for the Oculus Rift but this game is fun.  It's like a wave shooter on the high seas, defending your ship against invading pirates with quick aim and by dodging.  I don't think it's worth $9.99, but I definitely recommend it at a 50% sale or higher (I think I paid .99 cents if I recall correctly).Rate 6/10 buy on sale Arrghhh like a true pirate, never pay full price"

,Not Recommended,478950,24338453,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Hamu'kta-kali,"General overview: I really enjoyed the time I spent in this game. As a huge pirate fan, this seemed like a great choice.  The gunplay is fine and the treasure / shop system is clever and enjoyable. However, the game doesn't look great. The UI is clunky- images of the Vive controller pop up next to your ''elephant-man' hands when you click on the floating anchor to start the next round. Instead of a loading screen, you're sent back to the blank white nothingness and your hands turn back into vive controllers for just a moment before you're back on the bow of your ship.PROS:+ Fun gameplay and leveling mechanics+ Enjoyable atmosphere if you like pirates+ Clever Name+ Funny secret level+ Sword fighting on some levelsCONS:- Clunky at best UI (Maybe some pirate map inside the Cabin?)- Iffy controls- Feels like one has little interactions with the world aside from some boxes- No means to move around ship (I want to grab the steering wheel to start the next mission.)- $16 USD for a $5-10 gameVerdict: A very fun game if you can find it for $10. I wouldn't recommend buying this at the moment until they fix the UI and add more content. Apparently the developer is working on new stuff every week, which is admirable. It's a good game for one person to have made alone. I'd rate it a solid 6/10 -- add in new content, more movement, and fix the hands (maybe try something like hoverjunkers did), and the game would easily be one of my favourites."

It has a lot of the fun of Assassins Creed-Black Flag with none of the annoying stealth game play. The cartoony graphics dont seem to detract from the fun and I worked up a little bit of a elevated heart rate dodging and shooting back at the neerdowells that stood in between me and my treasure.About the only thing I didn't like was the rifle mechanic  had a reload that I couldn't get to function half of the time. The pistol reload was solid though and I can see myself playing quite a bit more even with just  the content they have so far.

In between each wave you get a chance to buy upgrades to your weapons and ship but to get there, you have to look down at your feet where you will see some rope and some text which states ""Jump to Shop"" -  however, this doesn't mean to actually jump, as i did - repeatadly - thinking that the game is broken as it's not porting me when i'm jumping. It simply means you need to bend down and grab the rope to jump the shop. I'm 16 stone in weight and was jumping up and down whilst my fiancee was laughing insanely at me."

The two Vive controller mechanic for aiming the rifle is interesting but without the controllers being physically connected still does not feel right.

Once you win you will be given a chest with coins in and sometimes a random one with a rare upgrade. You spend your coin on upgrading power of your guns and making your ship better. There are 10 missions which i completed them all in the time as seen on here. once you have comleted them all it will give you a harder setting mode. but at this point you already have all upgrades. The Graphics arnt good however the fun sides there and for money its well worth the try.i hope people bring out more pirate games as there is just none out there for VR"

But of prime concern should be audio...  there is zero indication that prirates have boarded your ship until you've already received a shot in your side. Also the lack of animation during their idle state makes them difficult to pick out from your static ship.A good start but as is not worth the $15
