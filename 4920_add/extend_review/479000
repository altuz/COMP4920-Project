The shooting isn't as crisp and I would like and there is very little variation in enemies.Has potential but where it's at right now I wouldn't recommend buying for the $5.99 asking price.For a full video review check out my video below.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=692025117

No challenge or 'fun' value to be had makes this game a 'play and forget' experience.Still, VR is in its infancy and hopefully we'll see some better more interactive titles in the coming months."

,Recommended,479000,23402069,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,The Illegible Poet,this is a very addictive arcade style zombie shooter! I made a 1.5 minute video review of the game here!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0DK28A-Pk0

Caigan,"An excellent start with promise.While its 'another zombie game' when we have hordez, zombie simulator, brookhaven experiment, etc, it does well to set itself apart already.The zombies ragdoll and flop around when you kill them. You unlock better weapons during a round by getting headshots and killing zombies with your katana.And you can throw said katana, which is extremely fun and amusing.The dev is also fairly responsive with the community so far, which is a plus."

,Recommended,479000,23257087,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,ЩĄ | pdgrizzles,"is bretty good!While early off this game has some kinks, the developer is super talkative and helped me with a problem already, this shows the dev or devs care asbout our input imo, also this probably indicates that this game will get better in time.The zombies are a bit strange but this game is enthrawling an trrifying when they are all rushing after you, it may seem like way too extreme but the dev may tone it down if we want. I kind of like the terror though.for 5 dollars or less why not, come try to beat my score fools!"

BUTIt need to be polished.(1).In game font and interface is poor(2).movement of zombies is unnatural(3).zombies' modeling is poor(4).physics is poorEven though above problemsThis game is quite fun. and musicIs good.
,Recommended,479000,23277016,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,Kasoi,"Buggy as hell. Pistol launches zombies high in the sky, weapon model doesn't replace controller model. However, first is kind of fun and latter can be easily fixed.The game itself is very simple if not basic. But VR makes it really fun."
,Recommended,479000,23345233,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Ryomi,"This game is alot of fun. The swordplay feels great and the sound effects of the sword while pulling out of your back and swinging are awesome. Yes you can cheat by swinging the swords infront of you, so just dont do that. I dont touch the guns all too often and spend most of my time throwing the swords like frisbees. My complaint would be that the difficulty ramps up too quickly. If you think of it as an arcade game, it is well worth the money. Hopefully it gets updated and expanded upon."
,Recommended,479000,23248914,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,EcstasyAndJOY,quite the adrenaline rush! if you plan on getting this be ready to get your blood flowing. Thus far there isn't a lot of content but the experience itself and game mechanics are very unique.  Lots of potential here. 8/10

I mean it looks as bad as it looks, but it's not a complete throwaway like I expected.As far as unrealistic zombie games go I'd probably pick this over Zombie Training Simulator since it's a bit more over the top."

Like a high speed house of the dead 2, and I very much enjoyed it. When the zombies get numerous and fast it makes your heart start pumping. Good game for 6 bucks. Now if if new levels could be added."

I would like to use my roomscale more and the only way to do that is to not have every zombie do a flying lunge at you from the edge of the play Space or have a drunken zombie side step and attack me in my blind spot.Please slow it down and let me methodically and intelligently eliminate the enemies in fun and creative ways instead of flailing in a million directions.In summary, I had fun but was also frustrated at the same time. Please keep developing because there is potential here."

76561198119268802,Recommended,479000,28262008,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,emptypipe,"Less intense than other Zombie shooters, which in my opinion is a good thing.Nice design. A good value for about that $10 price point, but if it were much higher, not sure I would've bought it.It's nice for parties, because it's just a touch scary, and it's fun to watch the person squirm in the Headset.Great work!"

While it's viscerally satisfying, the controls are needlessly clunky and the physics are not great.That being said, overall I recommend this game, as it's good to bring out at parties."

,Recommended,479000,23247528,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,@Dicky Spanish,"hmmmm if your idea of fun is shooting loads of drunk 'zombies' (and I use the term loosely) that run like they need one more drink to fall over. All the while standing in one place and getting weapons with unlimited ammo then this is for you.TBH like the really, really, really ugly dumb brother of the hot chick (HordeZ) that you ♥♥♥♥ just so you can say you ♥♥♥♥ed somebody in hot chicks family.Would recommend to anybody that does not like to think at all or likes watching the big bang theory."

,Recommended,479000,23228185,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,Game Cooker US Rocks VR,Good fun game. Good workout. It was one of the early VR wave shooter games we could buy. So don't compare it to today's wave shooters even though half of them still suck.Update 2-2017For two dollars this game is a steal !!! It was one of the first VR wave shooters that actually felt like the old machine based zombie shooters. Funny and fun. If we don't start supporting these VR games at the risk of the devlopers time the will stop taking a risk for us. This game is not crappy it is what it is meant to be. That is a big difference from the slew of crap wave shooters we have out now that are just being thrown together or just a copy of the last VR game that came out.Here is video below I made a while back playing with my son. We were not that good but had loads of fun.The game today may be better than this showed as it has been updated.https://youtu.be/dGoRcVVz3VM
