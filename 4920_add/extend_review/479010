,Recommended,479010,23386059,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,Satyr,"Super awesome software with a lots of potential, I think this is so far the app I am going to use the most on the Vive. As a 3D artist I have always thought to myself that it would be so cool to model  a 3D object with the ease and intuitivness of the real world, well the thought seem to have turn into reality. The soft is not perfect(not yet ^_~ ), but it truly show an outsanding potential. I believe it could get some real life artists into 3D modeling, because it destroys the interface barrier there is in other modeling apps.Suggestion for improvement:-using the analog trigger to determine the strength of the modification (instead/addition of/to the digital grip to better control the effect.-replace the ring of the controller with another toolhead (so that there is the same tool on both sides ) with the same orientation as the ring-add a join/fusion tool, I was sculpting a skull and when I did the jaw, I began on each side and tried to joined them at the center however the bits did not join.There are so many things that I could add to my feature wishlist but I don't want the dev to get overwhelmed by too many requests/suggestions^^. Maybe later!Excellent work so far and I totally recommend it to anyone who is interested in sculpting 3d models."

Here are my suggestions:* using the trigger to mold would be much more intuitive than grips* the mold point on the controller is at the bottom which seems weird and unintuitive. it'd be much better at the point of the controller rather than the bottom* the menu buttons can only be triggerred when you hover over the middle of them. this took me a little to figure out. it'd be better if they highlighted when you touch any part of the button."

I have seen many people confused about the upside down controller approch. While many people want it to be reversed, I like the idea. It makes it feel like you are holding a fat marker, like a mag44 :). However, the controller is not designed to be used like this and the button on the side is much harder to push and hold down. It also makes access to the track pad (brush selection) dificult to reach and is not very ergonomic.Since the brush doesn't actually do anything unless it is in contact with the model, I found myself constanlly hold the button which got tiring. I would recomend rethinking the controls, especially when you have to push the button side ways as opposed to pulling straight back like you would when using the trigger.Suggestions:ERGONOMICS!As I said; the brush doesn't do anything while not in contact, so why not make a toggle? Add and indicator light showing if the tool is on or off. Maybe use the track pad button to toggle on and off since it wouldn't be used as much and use the side buttons to switch tools. I like the idea of not having to push any buttons at all, it's just on.BRUSH SIZES:While I can see what you are trying to do with optimizing the mesh, scaling often destoyed my work because I zoomed out. If you want to quick block out a shape or edit a large area you want a big brush, but the only way to do that is to scale the model down which causes it to lose tris and when scaled back up it is hard to get that detail back. I would like an option to preserve the mesh ""resolution"". I am not worried about the number of tris, that can be optimized in other software with a couple clicks. Maybe even an option to set the denisity so you can adjust for the size or level of detail of the object you want to make.BOOLEAN:As I have see mentioned before, the ability to join the mesh. Like an auto weld when the object starts intersecting itself. Or the ability to have multiple shapes that can be merged or subtracted. That is basically the erase brush, maybe other shape options for subtacting?I think thats enough for now, I'm sure the dev is overwhelmed with all the feedback and deciding on the direction to go. Not to metion the amout of work still left to do.  I know the amout of work it takes to make stuff like this and I applaud the effort so far and thank you for this great tool!The three big things, TOGGLE THE BRUSH, BRUSH SIZE & RESOLUTION. Other than that, I think its AWESOME!!!Keep up the good work and I look forward to future releases."

Ok so I started to play around with sculpting with in Kodon and there is serous potential there. Some things that I notice is just the lack of tools that are needed to really do a great sculpt but im sure will be updated in future releases so thats not really to much of a issue be its a new way to tackle sculpts. One thing that worries me tho is, when sculpting in vr there is nothing pushing back letting you know that the tool is now on the mesh. Yes there is vibrations coming from the controller but no matter how hard I try to hold steady there is still unevenness throughout. Maybe instead of sculpting directly on the mesh, what about as the drawing tool start to approach the mesh  a drawing radius appears and gives a intensity that is controlled by a intensity setting by the user.  Tools I would like to see in future releases are, Move or pull tool ( tool that moves a radius of verts to a different location), Pinch tool, Control intensity of drawing, Control drawing radius, Control drawing fall off. The motion capture tool seems out of place with what this tool could be. One more thing, performance seems to be a issue which I can only assume can be fixed with improved hardware however with only a single light and no textures the performance seems to be a low. This software has a good chance to be something awesome! Keep it up!"

A bug that I have on my end right off the bat was the drawing tool was at the butt end of my controller. Had to hold onto the controller upside down... not comfortable to do.There is no undo buttonOnly five tool to use that dont actually work that well.cycling through the tools is a pain, same goes for the materialsThe draw button is on the side of the controller? This now makes sense if the draw tool really is supposed to be on the butt end of the controller. But its just uncomfortable to hold onto like that. Why not have the draw tool on the proper front of the controller and the trigger is the draw tool like TiltBrush?You will for sure want a GTX980 for this. I have a 970(for now) and once you hit a poly count of 30k+ the fps goes down to 45 and can make you a bit dizzy.If this app could mimic how TiltBrush works with its menu interface that you rotate on one of the controllers, then it will become a much better user friendly software.Only able to have one light in the sceneNot able to take screen shots of your work? feel like that should be a simple thing to haveI feel like this was rushed and put on the market as fast as possible to get some sells before something better comes along.I hope these issues are fixed, I dont like giving negative reviews."

At this stage, $20 feels pretty steep due to the lack of tools. If I could even grab an object in both hands and stretch it, that would be so helpful. I had a hard time being very precise with it, but maybe that just takes practice.Some tips -Someone here thought the controller was bugged, it isn't - you draw using the bottom of the controller.Took me a while to realize, but you can grab materials again after you add more to the scene. Hold the controller in the material until you see it turn white, and then you can grab it again (for a while I thought I couldn't grab old objects again).You don't have to cycle through all the material types slowly, you can use the menu and pop up a grid showing all the types, and choose the color/material there. Easier then cycling through 15 material types using the thumbpad.If they add a color pallete and more tools, could be a really good app."

It would be nice if the game had music, but its almost better that you can play your own. It's awesome that the object is in the room with you!! You can see your ideas in real life, in the room, and just sculpt your heart out as you would on a physical object. The controllers make a small vibration when you touch something, and the vibration changes for each tool, which really makes it feel like the object is there - you can really bring to life your inner imagination right in front of you. Its much like Tilt Brush, except you don't get tired of it after half an hour."

,Recommended,479010,25310022,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,ragnbones,"TLDR: Not ready for general use, buggy, but promising, if you've got the money, a worthy project to support.Writing a VR modelling application is a daunting challenge. Not only are you playing with new input devices but you are working in a technically challenging environment. Rendering output at 90FPS is not easy.As it stands today, version 0.35, Kodon is at a demonstration level only. If you purchase the app with the expectation that you will be able to whip out assets, you will be dissapointed. If instead you purchase this Early Access title with the understanding that you are investing in Tenk Labs and their efforts to bring 3d Modelling into a new paradigm, then you will have a better time with the application.The fact of the matter is, currently, Kodon is almost unnusable for all but the most rudimentary of geometry. This is I believe the result of using  a CPU render rather than leveraging Nvidia's toolset to offload the optimizations in parrallel, to the GPU. Even simple objects are routinely coming out at just under the current Vertex limit. This makes it almost impossible to model anything of any real utility.The developers need to make a greater effort to communicate their release schedule. Most users will not dig through Reddit to find out about your optimizations. Those that do, will be dissapointed at the sporadic posting and lack of a release timeline.I would HIGHLY recommend the team implements a Trello Board to help organise their efforts, reddit voting is not intended to be used for bug reporting and feature requests.I am excited, yet frustrated with this product. I can see huge potential, but the lack of updates, a website, or reliable sign of project management, makes it increasingly likely that a competing product such as VRTX or an improvement on the existing Blender VR plugin, will attract interest/investment from your market.I am very interested to see what happens in version 0.4. Optimizing the algorithm to run in CG will bring a huge improvement to performance, which at the moment is the single greatest problem this application faces.I am aware of how these development cycles can go awry and I hope TenkLabs, whoever they are, is able to wrest control of this ship and steer it into the Blue.After the work they've put in it would be a shame to find this project becalmed with users jumping ship."

In it's current state it's perfectly useable to make decently detailed objects.  With resizing you can add in quite a bit of detail.  I've done a model in thirty minutes that had taken hours in blender.  This also just feels right, since it's 3d for a 3d model that you manipulate in 3d while non vr programs are limited to a 2d screen with a 2d mouse plane trying to represent 3d.  This program is also easy to learn, taking me about five minutes or so to figure out how to do everything when just playing around with it.A few things to note.You can change which end of the vive controller is used.  This was probably added in between past reviews and now.  I do prefer the original setup.You can change the resolution/polygon count.  My minimum requirement rig just barely handles 28k polygons (mid setting).This does have a mirror/symmetry option.I'm assuming past issues with the menu were fixed.  I had no issues with it.This is still early access.  While perfectly functional for what I wanted, it may leave people use to other modeling programs like Blender wanting much more.  It has enough in it that I can make the models I want and I'm liking it enough to recommend it despite it's limited tool set and options.Things I'd like to see, starting with what I'd want most.Options for more lighting.Better save/load menu section that includes a way to delete old models.More tools.Explanation of tools and a better selection for tools, perferably in a floating menu and especially if more tools are added.Central axis indicator of some kind, preferably toggleable on and off.A way to realign the model level to the floor."

It has great potential but after spending an hour making a simple object, I opened the .obj file to find that it was a ratsnest / contained lots of crazy polygons and holes...totally unusable as prototyping art.A few ideas to make the program better:- Allow objects to be merged like a boolean. Eg: An arm to a torso. A foreArm to an UpperArm- Create dummy objects that can be seen so you can select small objects that are close to larger objects. Eg: I wanted to select the pupil of an eyeball but could only select the eyeball or the head and not the pupil.- Allow the objects to be manually cleaned so that more detail can be added. Made Slimer from Ghostbusters but it wouldn't let me create the jaw - like it ran out of juice or something, no more polygons for me. After I exited and reloaded, it worked - which means it's possible but buggy.- Allow tool size and power to be manipulated on the controller and not just the menu.Make undo-redo more intuitive. Personally, I'd use the Tiltbrush menu style / wrist menu. Don't think you are breaking copyright because it's just a toolbox and they can't patent /copyright a menu system, especially when they didn't invent it. Your current menu contains no location of where the user is in the menu but the software potential is so great that I endure the current menu system for now. Sometimes I can't even click the X in the corner to close a menu. Try not to have them so closeIf you want lots of feedback, I'm an active Game/CG artist and for now your tool could be great for prototyping but I guess I'll have to make my own 'Kodon' if this one is unusable."

I am absolutely thrilled that I can sculpt in thin air in front of myself and create something that feels to be real. This software has so much potential, it's tear inducing, but it is, however, still very flawed.My number one issue with Kodon as it stands now (beta version 5.0, I believe) is the linear, destructive workflow. I literally cannot think of a more frustrating quality for an artistic medium to have than a linear workflow; except not having an undo feature (Kodon does have an undo/redo feature, but it can be shotty and you cannot undo clearing the scene if you click the clear button*). I have run into issues with this setup more times than I can recall and have never found a linear workflow helpful in any scenario. The headset tracking seems to glitch a bit as well, it seems to happen after working on a project for longer than about 10 minutes. I think it may have something to do with whatever is the mechanism behind why the polygon limit is so low.**I am very excited for the upcoming update which I have been lead to believe will resolve at least a few of these issues.I have high hopes for Kodon, and I can't wait to see the final product. I just can't stop messing with it; I get so easily frustrated because I'll accidentally delete something I can't retrieve, or the app will crash and I have to restart my computer before it'll even open back up, etc. but I keep coming back.*The (irreversible) ""Clear"" button is at the top of the tool menu, just above where one would select a brush type and is one of the biggest buttons on the menu**Kodon has a Polygon limit of 60000, I have heard that this is temporary, but it is still a huuuge restrictionI hope this review is helpful and doesn't scare anyone out of trying it, because it really is amazing, it is just overtly unfinished.-Tif5f"

It's also great that it can import/export .obj files.As a beta app I can live with the fact that it crashes sometimes and that the tools are not very refined.What I really don't like is the draw button on the side controller, as an interface to sculpt with the bottom of the controller, this makes no sense to me. It's not intuitive and lacks precision, also it can't provide levels of pressure as the trigger does. As an artist, I can't hardly understand why it forces me to twist my wrist as all the other menus are accessed in a normal way. The Vive controller makes more sense if you think that you sculpt or paint like you would with your index up.Like all the other sculpting apps it lacks precision when it comes to create subtle marks or shapes such as eyebrows, lips, wrinkles.Selection is always a problem, you're never sure which geometry is active, no clue. Good tools to place the geometries, pin them, group them would be useful.Accessing the different menus, one after the other is not easy. I think it would be better to have successive pages. The top “grab” should be bigger as the X closing tab.It's probably difficult for programmers to use the sensitive pads to modify the size of the tools maybe there are not enough degrees for precise steps.As the developers specify, there is about 20% of the tools there, so it is promising, and worth the money so that these guys can continue their work.

I use VR and 3D printing to teach Maths and my only real headache is getting different tech to talk to each other. This solves half my problems at a stroke - I'm hoping it will eventually fix the rest!Please keep focusing on the import as well as export of .obj files - I'd hate to see that missing from the final version. Along the same lines, anything you can do to aid importing diffferent file types (e.g. from Matlab or other graphing program, Metaverse Schematics etc. This software is poised to be the hub that others communicate through!) would be great.One day soon, I'll have my students creating fractals and polygons, tweaking them in Kodon and then exporting them to print as keepsakes!"
,Recommended,479010,23383378,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,DeathGun,"For a VERY early access, it is not bad. This seems like a really nice program for sculpting, but if anyone intends to use it for actual modeling, I highly suggest to wait. Most of the core functions for modeling are entirely absent. You're restricted to a very small array of shapes, the brushes lack any kind of labeling as to what they do so you have to play around with them to see what does what (as far as I could tell). There seems to be a way to import concept art/reference material, which is nice, but I could not figure out how to go about that. There is probably a specific folder you have to put any art work in, but the ability to navigate to a directory in your pc would be a much better approach. It does have a very nice environment changing system, but there is not quick select so you have to manually nagivate through them all to see what the selection is. I have yet to test out if you can import your own models for sculpting by playing them as an .obj into the programs save folder, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. The only thing I actually had issues with was the lighting. I wanted to place my object in the center of the space, so I could walk around it and sculpt as I need to, similar to drawing in Tilt Brush. The problem was that I would either have to spin the object, which would offset the orientation from where I wanted it (which some form of snap to grid would be nice to prevent this), or drag the light around with me. The over head light is nice if youre working in a stationary location, but doesn't corrolate well working in 3D space, so a toggle for global lighting (similar to the mirror funtion) would help.Overall, not bad for a start to what could be an AMAZING program. I personally have issues using 3D modeling programs due to most of the camera systems being counter intuitive, as I am used to flying cameras and even the integrated flying cameras in programs like Blender seem a little off. A program like this, where I could work fully in 3D space, zoom in exactly where and how I want, could finally allow me to dig into modeling like I want. I by no means regret this purchase, and hope that the developers, are those considering purchase find my analycis helpful."

The only issue with that is that the tracking points sometimes gets blocked, but it's mostly not an issue as long as I'm sitting correctly.It's lacking a bit of customization, such as pressure, custom environments, lightning, model shapes, pen shapes and so on.

But it's perfectly useable for quick and accurate modelling.With a few more features and updates, this will become a 10/10 in my book.Absolutely worth the money."

This is very disappointing.Im certainly not expecting a Zbrush or Mudbox equivilant but I am expecting something that has some basic functions. Push/Pull, intensity controls... a wand that you dont have to hold backwards!! Why??This is not a product that is anywhere near ready for purchase.I see a habit forming where Steam is allowing almost anything if its VR, this is a sure way to ruin it for everyone in the long run."

I am loving this app. If you are into sculpting and have been waiting on a app like Medium (Oculus), then this is what you are looking for. It is very simple in its approach. I can't wait to see how it develops.Note:Inside the program you need to point and pull the trigger at menu options (they will highlight when you get close enough to activate the indicated option)."

,Recommended,479010,29477621,Posted: 24 January,all,SuckerFreeGames,Wow this is a pretty cool VR 3d modeling program! It’s extremely simple to us and reminds me a lot of Sculptris. I tested it out for 10 minutes and have found that I really like it. I will definitely give this an hour or so over the weekend  I hope it let’s me bring in 2D images for reference (I haven’t tried to do that yet) if so I’m going to be very happy.

Kodon has a long way to go before it is useful. It is neither useful to create solid wireframe like you would expect in 3DS Max. The scultping is nowhere near intutive enough to create anything but blobby messes. I am going to hold back from returning this in hopes this improves in the future."

Really, try it and see for yourself.The Undo feature is broken beyond repair.Sadly Masterpiece VR is superior in every aspect except for the missing export. And it is done in Unity.There is a reason as to why all the shown models look rather bad. I dont think any person involved in this knows how sculpting suppose to work.The first time i needed to refund a program.Try it for yourself but it is completely useless for even the simplest of serious work attempts."

Lackluster performance on powerful machine and the developer isn't making updates (over a month).   At this stage of the game early release should be seeing more funtionality performance with some frequency.overall most dissapointed.  hope full that changes<edit> the kodon team has been plogging away and i looks like they're making some progress.

,Recommended,479010,29472575,Posted: 24 January,all,O'bear,"This program has the capability of become a very in depth, amazingly fun and useful 3D sculpting tool. with all the right tools and export features this could bloom into one of VR's Premier tools.  Thats of course if the developer continues to develop it at a good rate.PlusesVery good initial promise. Makes creating 3D content VERY easy especially for someone totally new to creating 3D models. It's A LOT of fun and the scope and things you could create are endless.improvements could e made...If developer is reading this, please go and spend some te inside Tilt Brush program from Google examine closely how the two handed tools work together seamlessly for all the drawing and importing and exporting tools. It is a pure example of how a floorless and totally natural input device UI should be for this kind of artwork.I know this is early stages but one of the most glaring issues for me was working with the controls and menus.it's not fluid or intuitive enough yet and interrupts the workflow.This will be a KEY feature on how people perceive the program as it’s going to be negative for people if they are fighting against the controls.The focal point of the drawing tool should extend OUt of the handset, currently it seems to be in the middle and the handset ensures your drawing area, a perfect exe is Tilt brush where the tips of the drawing tools  are little pointed ends. Also please change the handset model for one more like Tilt brush. The default torus shaped end is cumbersome for designing and drawing.While having a floating menu  good for some things (like Tilt Brush Media importer, camera controls etc) its not good for swapping out controls during your workflow, again this is where tilt brush excells (yes I;’m raving tilt brush controls but they are perfect)  One controler is a drawing tool with you of tool, pressure levels etc. The other land tool should be effectively like an artist's pallet, where you bring the brush tool across and interact with it to select the type of tool and materials you need, just as a brush would be sued to pick up pain for an artist. Its what Tilt brush does so well.   I should ONLY need a menu of doing stuff thast not involved with the constant workflow.While i ‘got it’ in the end please add a bit of description to the tool in your hand rather that just a  graphic. At least for a second as it changes to that tool.I found it very difficult to handle multiple objects and creating objects and navigating with them sometimes. It was not always clear what or how i was supposed to achieve certain things. Sometimes i successfully managed to grab just one object, next moment i had all of them moving.  So some more work on solid and clear object navigatio would be awesome.Need to be able to grow the tool more than current to pull push etc very large areas rather than have to use the resize to do so.   Resize should go hand in hand with that and not be the only way to push pull etc fine detail or massive areas.This is a very promising start and could turn into a tool that could demand a high premium, adn sued by profesisonals if developed to its full possibilities."

I'm giving this a positive review for what it is trying to achieve and what I believe it will become. While I owned this program I experienced a few small bugs, as to be expected from an alpha game. I'm hopeful that in the future this program will be polished and a great tool to the indie development scene.Pros:-As an independent developer this tool could make good quality 3d models possible without large investments in artists.-Very intuitive and allows you to jump in and start creatingBugs:-When scaling, the polygonal definitions break and you end up with holes in the model (I don't know how these affect the exported model, but they can be corrected by going over that area again at your new scale)-The menu system is sometimes unintuitive, sometimes you can get stuck in a menu and are not able to get back.-Program will sometimes stop(If these are fixed please say so and I will update my review)Cons:-Polylimit-No autosave"
