But for 4 dollars (at the Steam Summer Sale) I had great fun playing it for a couple of hours, well worth the money."

76561197993500303,Recommended,479020,33810581,Posted: 26 July,all,Gorebane,"A fun game similar to Windward. While Windward is ""released"" this game is in early access so has a lot of potential. It's quite simplistic at the moment, a lot of features seem to only be placeholders for future updates. There are no ship upgrades or the like. You can't create your own captain, and there is no skill system in place.This is certainly one to keep an eye on, and while it took me 3 hours to complete, I imagine it will become more in depth as time goes on."

,Recommended,479020,29793355,Posted: 8 February,all,Dan,"Loving this game.  I think it captures the good part ofSid Meier's Pirates!and throws away the rest.   What it does capture is the awesome broadside battles of pirating .. with a generous dash of extras (Fire shot, City building, ninja sharks, and rolling waves).For an early access game, it has quite a bit to offer so far.  Looking forward to them adding wind and different sail levels ..."

I and many others loved it. They didn't always have the fastest progess, but it was an enjoyable game. I shared a lot of good times with friends over that game.Unfortunately, our fun ended with about half the features we wanted and about 75% of the ones the devs wanted. No explanation was given for dropping it, well, no good one.History repeats itself with this game. Only the backing by the fans isn't really there. So the progress isn't there either.Buyer beware, they will probably drop this one as well."
76561198049914840,Not Recommended,479020,32799221,Posted: 25 June,all,ritz176,I know this game is in EA but it just isn't that much fun. Sharks kill me faster than boats and there are way more sharks than boats.  Going pirate (which is a temporary thing) lets you quickly get renown up but has little other benefits. I was hoping for a pirate style Beyond Sol but this is nowhere near that. For me I just can't reccomend it.
76561198052469457,Not Recommended,479020,30394877,Posted: 8 March,all,DUCK,"Wouldn't recommend for those who want gameplay, but a decent EA then fine go ahead.Does not seem like much have changed the last year (might be something they are holding back for a big update)...?Which is again a reason for not recommending the game.The lack of really much response or updates (some small ones and far between each other)Now... about the game.Its got a nice progress from trading, quests and getting better stuff and upgrading your town.I forgot if one could have multiple towns when destroying the enemy (is a possibility)Else there isn't a way to build your own and little fun about the whole town aspect for now.As its just a generator of resources and upgrade some of them, like a dock to get access to better ships.Which in some ways makes the whole thing more of a tiresome system.Its nice to level up and have that progression.Some of my points that you could see from the trailer that mostly shows everything about the game.- Some abilites to use in combat.- more unique types of ships or way to deal with things.- Buildings that would unlock stuff or such.- maybe adding a way to build on islands like in windward (there you get a costing ability to plant y/x towers etc)- Some more creatures.- Hopefully if it supports more worlds, as one map round and around can become boring (which windward did better)- The world/map would be better if it wasn't always the ""same"", as in events more things happen and so on.to maybe a final goal.Although the game windward is sort of better in many ways, it also is quite a tedious and a low budget game with one dev I think."

The ability to build your own Sea port is also amazing within itself, and so far as i've seen, very little bugs so far. Great game! 10/10"

,Recommended,479020,29669688,Posted: 3 February,all,Trip,"It's............ ok. I've been playing for nearly 3 hours now and it's already starting to get really repetitive. Worth £10? Probably not but as Steam doesn't have a ""maybe"" category then it's getting a thumbs up because it is enjoyable."
,Recommended,479020,24632640,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,MyMy,"TL;DR It's something between 'promising' and 'don't buy for the next year'.The combat mechanics is WASD+space: sail in circles and hold-release space to shoot. There's also an option to set the enemy on fire - you shoot to a bit advance point. It's ok but fun wears off quickly.Metagame is not offering much. You have a choice of only 6 building and progressing with them is strictly numerical. New ships don't offer much new enjoyment either, new abilities would help a lot. And you gain new levels by paying money. Missions are not particularly interesting as well: DHL, find something, kill someone.If the version number 0.1.2 means it's at 12% of content then 100% may be quite enjoyable. But at this rate the game will be in Early Access for another year or two. In its current state I recommend this game if it's on sale and if you are really starved for games like Sid Meier's Pirates and Windward."

It just says ""Loading"" for 15 minutes (maybe more, I'm just tired waiting), and nothing happens after that. I'm very displeased about buying such a product, which is not even playable, still selling on Steam.100% of not recommending this to anyone."
,Not Recommended,479020,32884112,Posted: 27 June,all,KorhanKa,This is a quite nice game but it took only 4 hours to figure out how the game is works and then you are looking for if there is more and sadly you get bored because you should do same things again and again.

,Recommended,479020,33846767,Posted: 27 July,all,Emrico1__1,"A fun little game with maybe 5 hours gameplay (single player) if you are keen.I liked the game, it was easy and enjoyable. Definitely worth $5.The little sea battles were fairly straight forward  but fun and the trading was good. This game is best suited to a younger audience as it's simple. Building your little town and needing certain resources to expand is a nice aspec and should be focussed on. Coming home and getting better ships is rewarding.Things I didn't like: I want wind. I want to sail and tack and use the wind to fight, not drive around a boat like a car.The map was small and exploration fairly pointless. Also needs a big boss to defeat rather than just renown points."
,Not Recommended,479020,34885125,Posted: 11 September,all,Fishfingers,"Fun game, albeit a bit simple for my taste. Kind of missed a directional wind mechanic."
