76561198112187827,Not Recommended,479100,33159194,Posted: 2 July,all,joshuaball09,This game is a brilliant idea but it's completely unfinished. I played for a few hours until I encountered the various bugs and crashes. This really plays like a beta. I wouldn't waste your time at the moment. Perhaps wait for a version 2.0.
,Not Recommended,479100,31292069,Posted: 22 April,all,VHPRECORDS,WHAT A COMPLETE RIP OFF. I PAID FOR IT BUT CAN'T EVEN PLAY IT. THE GAME KEEPS SAYING I NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET TO REGISTER MY ACCOUNT. CONSIDERING I DOWNLOADED IT FROM THE INTERNET THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WELL DONE STEAM FOR RIPPING YOUR CUSTOMERS OFF.
,Recommended,479100,23339590,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,CMDR_Leonard,"I am checking yes because of the thought that went into the game and the potential it holds.  As of now, it is fun for a few hours as you figure out the mechanics (there is no tutorial), but after that it is tedious and impossible.  It is in dire need of tuning, which I will address below, but as stated above, I believe there is potential here for a fun management sim, especially if modding is allowed which it appears to be. However, right now the game is just not there.There are a few points that are easily correctable that I believe would make the game orders of magnitude better.First, the constant goals popping up with unrealistic timeframes need to be fixed. Maybe there is an option to turn them off that I missed. When you start the game as a new independent label, and then have 12 weeks to produce a #1 album in the USA… you’re not going to make it.  This in turn causes your reputation to go down, which makes it even harder to sign acts, and that leads me to my second point.Second, there needs to be some tuning on the act signing / talent searching.  I understand that you should not be able to sign Justin Beiber (he sells a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of records) when you just start your label, but if you spend 9 weeks and $2,000,000+ on a talent search; there should be a chance for you to uncover a star.  I ran several talent searches and the results were formulaic.  Very few artists excelled in more than 2 areas. If they were good singers and had sex appeal, they weren’t mainstream.  If they were mainstream and had sex appeal, they couldn’t sing, etc…Finally, and this is by no means the end of my list of corrections I would like to see but it is the end of this list, there really needs to be some corrections made to the double booking.  If you hire a manager and then turn around and book a tour for an act being managed, the manager can then book a tour on top of yours.  At one point I had an artist playing in Toronto and Los Angeles on the same day. Obviously this is logistically feasible, but it is not something that would be allowed to happen in real life.Minor points, better feedback on what your artists and doing/accomplishing (ticket and record sales) on the home screen would be nice; hints or advice or even questions from your staff would be nice.  I have many more things I could list, but I am doubtful the developer will read this, so I will stop now.To sum up, I would recommend buying the game, IF you have the money and want to invest in something that could be fun a few weeks/months from now.  If you are one of those people who think it’s the end of the damn world to spend $13 on a game that isn’t AAA, or who ♥♥♥♥♥es about DRM as if you have more than one gaming computer that YOU use (not your brother/sister/wife/gf/friend), then this game is not for you, and also you should go drown yourself because you are what is wrong with the gaming community."

,Recommended,479100,23370341,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Hell Motel,"As a big fan of Music Wars Rebirth and text-based sims in general, I've been pretty excited for this game for a while now. After an hour or so of playing I have to say I'm pleased with the game so far. It's early yet and my opinion can change, but I like the changes I see from MWR -- that said, I largely skipped MWR2 because of bugs involved with modding near the beginning of its lifespan, so I don't really know which features are completely new here.There are a few gripes I have with the game, though. The lack of fullscreen is pretty detrimental to the overall experience, which is a huge shame. I find it to be an odd design choice in 2016. Also, the outdated DRM is rather curious as well, but I can forgive this because the game designer has eliminated the machine activation limitation due to the negative response to this choice. Unfortunately the DRM seems to cause Steam to count the game as ""running"" even after you exit, which is a moderate annoyance. The pictures for all of the artists in the game, seen in screen shots, do not show up in my game at all.I also think there are some balancing issues that definitely need a second look. For example, I put a decent amount of money into an unknown artist's first single. It bombed, which isn't too surprising, but I then released a rather successful music video for the song which is seeing about a million views a week while the single itself is selling about 4 copies a week with no signs of growth. The exposure from a popular music video would definitely have a much larger impact on a single's success but that doesn't seem apparent.This is just my early feeling toward the game and that can easily change with updates. In the future, I'd like to see some progress made toward correcting these issues as well as ensuring that mods work as painlessly as possible. I like simming really long games and to have MWR2 crash constantly after adding a few acts to the game was rather disheartening (my reason for sticking to MWR1). Overall I feel pretty positive toward the experience so far and I'm optimistic toward the future of the game."

However because of this promise and the fact that I have enjoyed what I have played (despite at time being annoyed) I will still recommend this game.These are some of the issues that I came across whilst playing this game (there were others but these are the ones I could think of off the top of my head.)-Sales from music are extremely unrealistic (13,000 sales for a US number one) streaming figure also seems low- Album sales make no sense My artists first EP sold 12,000 copies worldwide yet made $3.1M the second EP sold 94,000 copies but only made $3.8M-Yes and No buttons aren't standardised in menus meaning it’s easy to click no to something when you intended to press yes if you’re not paying attention-Artist side projects/going solo (despite staying in the band) massively affects the reputation of the band plenty of artist If anything a member of a bad doing a solo project on the side of the band should help it become more known.-B-sides don’t work-Seems to be a lack of income from YouTube-Bands seem to randomly leave the label, I had a band who’s releases were selling pretty well, their moral was high etc. but they just randomly left and I had no way of working out why.-there seems to be no way of turning the auto save feature off-endless CEO goals-Writing process takes too long. You wait several months for the artist to write and record a selection of tracks. It would be better if each track was made available as soon as it had been composed allowing you to choose which tracks to record. And allowing you to release singles without having to first record an entire albums worth of material-It would be helpful if you were given a rough estimate of how good a song produced by a third party is before you bought it-Some kind of guide on what things do would be helpfulDespite what this list looks like I do think it’s a good game with lots of promise, I just think it needs a lot more polishing."
