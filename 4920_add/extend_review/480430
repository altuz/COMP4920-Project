76561198077434372,Recommended,480430,26223998,"Posted: 25 October, 2016",all,Mindshadow,"tl;dr version: Is this the kind of game you'll play for ages and have ranked tournaments with months from now? No. Is it $5 worth of Halloween entertainment for the next month or so? Absolutely!Hide and Shriek is a very well balanced 1v1 scarematch game where you have to either outscore or outscare (or ideally both) your opponent. The fact that resources are randomly distributed - even the runes you use to craft spells are randomly chosen at the start of the match - means that there's no one preferred location or ideal loadout you can use. Having to continually scramble about looking for resources and never quite having the right spell components in place keeps it from being too comfortable at any point. (It is admittedly true that sometimes the RNG blesses you with abundant resources of exactly the right kind for your strategy but you can never count on this being true.)The way the match feels will vary wildly depending on the chosen tactics of the two participants. For example, two people who enjoy turtling or ambushing will feel very lonely and a bit silly after a while if they don't switch tactics. But this is part of the appeal of the game. It prioritizes thinking on your feet and making use of what's available and adapting to your opponent rather than twitch reflex competition. The benefit from skill plateaus quickly - beyond a basic knowledge of how the game works that's required to compete at all, greater skill simply doesn't give you the overwhelming advantage it does in other games. You still face the exact same limits as your opponent.While this game does have some jump-scare elements, I've found it's pretty rare to be totally surprised. It's more often an ""oh **** I hit a trap nooooo"" and then the other player finishes me off while I'm stunned. The fact that you're able to strike back on equal terms suppresses a lot of the overwhelming sensation of some jump scare games.To get back to the tl;dr, yeah, this is probably not a game I'm going to play for more than a couple of weeks around halloween. But I definitely feel I'm going to get my money's worth from it."

The game play with scoring by either tricking your opponents with traps (via rigging them along the ground, doors, cabinets, etc) and by finding your invisible opponent and shrieking them, 3 shrieks in a row and you win automatically!Each match lasts 10 minutes and all 10 of those can be filled with tense searching and hoping that your next touch isn't going to throw you across the room by a gust of wind, or that cabinet you touched might electrify you, or even that noise you heard is your invisible rival opening something right next to you unknowingly.It's a fun little game, an added bonus if you're a fan of The Secret World in which this game has goodies for, the only downside is possibly the lower population of players further down the road after halloween.Edit: As of late November I've found the game a bit more difficult to find players with.

76561198086029824,Recommended,480430,26273137,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Liquid Lite,"""A diamond in the rough"" is the first thought that came to mind when i played my first session of this game. Personally this game first came to my attention while watching H2o delirious (great lad would recommend) and from there on had to have a go at it. The game itself is a 1v1 first person online multiplayer horror were players assume the role of two high school students from Miskatonic's estranged sister school of Innsmouth high during Halloween night in a twisted magical game of something akin to hide and seek. Each player is invisible to one another and objectively must attempt to acquire their coloured orbs of blue or red and deliver it to their periodically moving altar all the while avoiding, countering and entrapping their enemies with magical game changing runes scattered around the map. To win players must by the end of the countdown or jump scare their opponent 3 times in a row, have accumulated more points plus the additional bonuses than their opposition.Story/character Development: Like with any funcom game, the narrative background of this particular game is set in the same universe as funcom's MMO The secret world, with several allusions to the TSW around the map and in the lore. Evidently the narrative of the game itself is more or less what you would expect in a 1v1 online game. I  love the premise of the story and how it sets the frame of mind for the game. There is just something about two students from what would be the equivalent of what would be Hogwarts but with a contemporary twist, getting up to mischief on Halloween that appeals to me. Maybe it is the inner lore lover i am or the many references to the other games of funcom i have so many fond memories of. The developers clearly thought out the background for the game and its implementation into the actual game play. The many background stories of how the mystical runes came to be or the various brief but intriguing references to characters from TSW that helps build their background.3.5/5Replay Value: Moving on from my reminiscence and into the actual quality of the game, the replay value is somewhat abundant. The basics of the game are the same in every round, find orb, find altar, place orb on alter and earn points to stay ahead of your opponent. The runes however are what make this game truly special. With around 10 unique spells all with different opportunities to ♥♥♥♥ with your class mate and not to mention the additional spells created from combining certain runes, this game gleefully presents you with about 30 different ways to scare and hinder your opponent or protect you from them. I must admit i get a buzz at leap frogging around the map every time i find a hopscotch rune. Never the less it is the unique situations presented in each game that make this one something to pick up again and again. I for instance encountered one fellow who wouldn’t stop leaving decoy exploding orbs for me to find or another time when i encountered a player who had a knack for throwing fireballs. Another addition is the levelling system used to unlock certain items that will be mentioned in customization. Some people probably think that on top of everything a levelling system is stupid however I disagree, it is this very levelling system I have found that can be an incentive to come back and play again. But the biggest absolute blue balls thing about this game is the map. More maps is a must for a game like this if it is to stay afloat.3.5/5Gameplay and controls: The true gem of this game is its gameplay and although clunky, its controls are simple and clear to understand. The game provides a repetitive basis goal so that players clearly understand what they have to do but also uses the game changing runes to combat any boredom the player might encounter. Its abundance of spells to screw over the opposition and the individually customised jumps cares are what make this game so enjoyable yet simple as to understanding your goal. The actual controls of the game are clunky to be blunt, with high motion blurs and a sort of swaying as you walk all of which can be changed from settings. But the consistent clicking and holding just to open doors and cupboards can defiantly leave you with a sore hand after a few games.4/5Graphics: I almost forget that funcom is actually a pretty wealthy company sometimes because of the below average fan base and little advertising I see of it, so going into this game I expected somewhat of a bare minimum of graphical quality but oh boi am I glad I was proven wrong. This game is beautifully designed in its spliced magical high school aesthetic, everything drawn and textured in detail. Sure it’s not as realistic looking as people would like it to be but that is exactly what fits the game itself. Its entirety is based on a wacky game two kids play WITH MAGIC. It isn’t meant to look as if it was a real place because it was built not to be. It was designed to look fun and mysterious, to appeal to that inner child of ours back when our imaginations ran rampant and magical school games like this, for us at least, existed. So some people might disagree with me here and I realise that as the game grows it will look better but from what I see now the developers are on the right track.4/5Character customization: I am so glad that they included a feature like this into the game and although sometimes it can seem like a very small feature, it’s always enjoyable to be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the abominations other players have created. The entire customization mechanic for the game revolves around the jumps scares you use to catch your opponent. A singular head model with a variety of 10 default heads to choose from, mixed in with different laughs and voices plus 18 different decorations PER-HEAD it’s gonna be one hell of a night. The only catch? The levelling system. You unlock one customization option per level you level up which again is an incentive to play again which I agree with. Overall I always like it when i get to see other people’s creations on screen and what I could possibly do with my own to scare others. In conjunction with the runes, it adds a refreshing aspect to the game with its basic repetitive plays sometimes.   3.5/5Co-op and Online Multiplayer: The real kick in the balls aspect about this game. Taking into consideration that it is very new so there hasn’t been a lot of time for people to join, the amount of people that play this game are sparse to few. If this game is to survive it needs more players, something which can, given funcoms fan base, be a major problem. Obviously they have got some popular youtubers to advertise it and steam advertisement is also good but please for the love of god it needs a bigger player base if it’s going to continue. Waiting times can be a killer (don’t worry I found a fix for those of you who know what im talking about), but the ping you get is actually decent and trust me this is coming from a guy who gets (if im luck) 600kb/s speed tops.3.5/5(Pro tip: to shorten wait times make sure u are connected to NA region in the games options and change your download region on steam settings to Washington DC, make sure u change back to your region tho when downloading new games or when you finish playing)Final thoughts and review: it’s not often you find a game like this and I highly recommend it. My only recommendations for this game is its expansion on maps and possibly runes and spells to keep people interested, maybe a few game modes to spice up the basics would also attract a lot of players back for more and for Christ sakes more advertising not just for the developers but for the players as well. So many good games have failed on the basis that their wasn’t a big enough player base and I pray to Cthuhlu (pun intended) that doesn’t happen to this game so share and recommended this please to anyone you might think would be interested.Overall: 4/5"

I even got into a all out discussion about this game with one of my friends whom i was playing this with and me and him both agreed, this game needs something to change it up. On that note, if they were to do something for the game along the lines of make interchangeable rooms(For example, add in a room that could take the place of the classroom), that would give it a better feel for the game, so that every game is not the same one. It is true it doesnt change much, but its still one of the little things. Another of the things we were discussing was enhancing the map and making a 4 man fight, makes it a lot more hectic and keeps you on your toes. Lastly one more suggestion we had come up with, was if none else is done to enhance the game, to enable modding support for the game, i would love to see where the community could possibly take the game. However i would like to state, even with my low hours and none of the suggestions are considered, the game itself is worth the money, i cannot deny this much."

Special orbs in your team-color are most valuable - they are hidden randomly across the map. So you can focus on collecting orbs or placing traps to shriek the other player. If you get shrieked three times in a row, you will lose.Matchmaking works fine but menus are sometimes laggy for me and there is only one map. Hide and Shriek isn't a long time burner but gives you some short competitive 1-vs-1-matches for in-between."

I am left wanting the following:1. Steam Workshop access I feel would be very good; modders could add almost anything to the game from new skins and animations to new runes and enviroments without the developers having to shell out lots of time updating the game.2. Elaborating on a part of point 1, the fact that there is only 1 largely static map gets quite drape after a while. I think even just adding a couple more could go a long way to making the game more replayable.3. Larger multiplayer. Okay, this point is going to be more debatable than the last 2 points I mentioned, but I personally believe extending the game from a mere 1v1 experience to a 2v2 or even more could go a LONG way to making the game more enjoyable. More players = more traps and scares. Fun times!4. This point is ofcourse a given; better optimization. I find myself lagging from time to time and it can be quite frusterating.Anyway, great game!"

First off, it runs very well on my old working laptop, and that's rare; And in spite of these low requirements the game provides much fun!The descriptions of each single spell are lovely and funny written, as well as the stories that you are able to find scattered across the map, along with other easter egg customisations.As a fan of H.P.Lovecraft I was delighted (yet not nurprised, since every Fun Com game has had some references to him so far) to find a bunch of references in this game.Also despite the seemingly low variation of the game, since it unfortunately only has one map (yet!), it takes quite some time to discover every single Spell in the game.The techniques used in the game are also interesting, since you may be forced to preserve your spells for a certain opportunity, like trap your foe (e.g. the little springs twerp) or hastily running around a room and frantically searching for a rune to escape a curse of you enemy (e.g. Innsmouth punk) before you get jumpscared.The jumpscares aren't very scary, it may get you a little bit, when you're totally not expecting it, otherwise it doesn't have a big effect on me; Yet it's quite entertaining to scare or get scared over and over again, even if it's not scary.To start a match a simple click on the ""public match"" button is enough, but as it is on every not popular online game: To find your desired opponent it can take quite some time.

There are multiple ways to reveal your opponent, and once you know where they are, you can activate your ""shriek"" which will trigger a floating head jumpscare on the enemy's screen, and get you points.If you shriek and your opponent isn't close enough, you will be revealed for them to see for a short time.The most common way to reveal your opponent is by catching them in a trap. You can collect different runes throughout the level, which all have unique powers. Sometimes you can set traps, and sometimes they will give you powers to remove any curses you might have. Runes can even be combined to give unique traits. Some can be very interesting, like sending your enemy to an alternate dimension to waste their time, or allowing you to dash through walls.Some runes can be shot ahead of you, some can be traps set on the floor, some are on interact-able doors or closets etc. So there's a lot to play around with.The main way to get points is to collect orbs and put them on your altar. You can even pick up enemy orbs in order to set up traps. I like to put theirs behind transparent cupboards, and then trap them. The whole game is about outsmarting your opponent.As you level up and get achievements, you will unlock customizables for your character, which is quite fun.Most stuff is balanced quite well. Although I have a problem with 2 powers. One of them being a wisp that follows your enemy and teleports them to another dimension. Even if you see the wisp, it seems for no matter how long you run away from it, it will catch up to you eventually. I don't know if there's a long timer on it or if it just chases you indefinitely, but that just causes it to be more efficient to just run into it as soon as you see it to avoid wasting time.The other one, is a power that reveals all runes close to you, and your opponent. It kind of defeats the entire point of the game if you can just see your enemy constantly through walls, there's no investigation anymore. It's not even that hard to get that power, and it seems a lot of people have realised it and are using it the majority of the time, which is why I prefer to just play with a friend and avoid using that power.Overall, I really am loving the game so far. The aesthetic and music is great, the idea is fun and unique, and it's just great to hear your friend scream when you trap them!"

The first is by scaring the opponent 3 times in a row and the other is by just getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of points. Getting the points is monumentally easier than scaring the opponent and in the half-dozen games I played only once was either of us able to get a win from scaring as opposed to just time running out and winning by points.It was a neat game but I would only suggest picking this up half-off in a future sale."

Not sure I can see it having this massive community or anything like that, but it's definitely pretty fun for the price tag, and it's something I can see myself playing with my friends fairly often. It's charming, yet still able to give you a jolt if you're not ready for a spook or a trap. There isn't really any depth to it--there's one (somewhat small) map with random rooms, there's two victory conditions, and a lot of the masks are just re-skins of each other--but it's still a good way to have some laughs and some shouts, be it with friends or with randoms. The mask customization is pretty fun, and has a good deal of options so each mask feels unique. The runes (that allow you to use spells, and can be combined for better spells) are very fun to play with and experiment with. The little hidden bits of lore that you can unlock through books is a fun read. I may be more into it because I dig TSW and anything that spawns from it, but I'd definitely say this is a good game, independent of TSW. It's cute, it's spooky, it's a blast with friends!

76561198077817724,Recommended,480430,26945783,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,jaqueline.arai,"The idea is great.You play with a friend and try to scare him by setting traps and using magic.The fun part is that you don't know where your friend is because everyone is invisible, so you have to use strategies to find him. If you are to afraid to be scared, you won't win the game, because you have to (cleverly) take risks in order to gather points.It is also addicting. When you lost, you really want a rematch, and because the matches are so short, about 10 min, you can play a lot without getting tired of it.The only bad thing I have to say is that the game could have more features, like different maps or the possibility of playing with more people, but since it's pretty recent, I hope the developers keep improving."

The main downside is that there's only 1 map, and you can only do 1v1, but the rune combinations can keep things modestly interesting.  Hopefully there will be additional content later down the line (hopefully with more than 1v1 too), cause this has a good bit of potential."

It has nice graphics and im sure it would be fun to play with a friend (none of my friends have the game yet). I would recommend this to anyone who likes jumpscare games and playing with friends. Also there are hilary clinton and donald trump jumpscares you can get so yeah....

It's very fun and can somtimes be really scarey.

It's a lot of fun to play with a friend who gets scared easily. I found that laying traps was quite fun in itself, and watching people fall for them was equally as fun. I recommend this to anyone who likes to hear their freinds scream in terror. 10/10"

76561198195470106,Recommended,480430,33301310,Posted: 5 July,all,-Gaze- Beyond,This is an extremely fun game to play and I highly recomend it. *BUT* I recomend you have a friend to play it with. the matchmaking is very slow but starting a private match is way easier. I thin it either because not allot of people play this game or it is just a new game that needs a fix. other than that this is a go to game that is very interactive and fun to play with friends. 9.5/10

,Recommended,480430,33838049,Posted: 27 July,all,Spoonerrific,"Decently fun if you have a friend to play with, but even then it gets relatively old fast. There's also basically nobody on, so if you DON'T have a friend, good luck ever finding a game. All this being said, I think it's worth $6 if you can find somebody to play it with.Some in-depth details are as followsPros:- Game looks great with a fun graphical style- Customization is silly but enjoyable- Offers some decent spooks- Interesting gameplayCons:- The spooks are easily identifiable after 5-6 matches- There's only one gamemode- Gameplay ends up getting repetative also around 5-6 matches"

I love horror, so this was fun for me. 10/10 would play again. Nothing much else to say for this game, besides it's horror and I enjoy horror, soooooooooo, if you enjoy horror too, I recommend this game for you. One more thing, if you're just getting started with horror, buy this game, it's fun as I said and...BOO! Did I scare ya? No? You're good!"
