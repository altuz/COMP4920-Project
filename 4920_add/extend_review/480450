It's very entertaining, if not a little bit hard to control (usually comes down to just luck, or maybe I'm just bad)I'd love to see this have an online multiplayer."
76561198074257097,Recommended,480450,25501579,"Posted: 13 September, 2016",all,.WiN.,"A smashing evolution of an old formula. People who've played and enjoyed Ragdoll Masters, Ragdoll Kung Fu, Hammerfall, and other turn-of-the-century physics-based beat-em-ups will recognize the excellence of this title immediately.For the uninitiated, you control a ragdoll character in a puppet fashion, flailing their weapons toward enemy weak points. In this game, armor provides some resistance to damage before falling off entirely, and further damage to un-armored limbs will result in dismemberment. Armor can provide offensive capabilities as well, which one-ups previous titles of this kind. An armored boot beats a bare skull, and even limbs holding weapons can be lopped off for proper disarming. Ranged weapons are included, and seem pretty fairly balanced with their limitations of reload speed and aiming precision. You can block with your weapons, as well as equip shields in your off-hand.There is some character customization available, aside from gear you can also customize hair/skin/facial features and their respective colorings. The weapons and armor can't be recolored, however. Weapons can be held in reverse grip as well as standard, adding more depth to the loadout. Customized loadouts can be saved and loaded as the situation demands.Single player is a 10-match affair, your custom character versus ten assorted combinations of foes in varying gear and sizes. Wins unlock keys, which unlock more gear. There's no storyline, no excess reading, just heavy metal and the clash of steel.Upside:Quick and painless to drop in or out ofSimple to learn, truly impressive when skill meets talentGreat advances over previous niche titlesLocal MP includes some different modes, as well as customizable gravity and move speedPlenty of weapon variety/possible loadoutsDirt cheap game, I paid $2.09Downside:No female floppiesCan't customize gear appearance, just characterAI is fairly easy, didn't see difficulty optionsGame is short, All achievements in first day/3hrs ingameMusic is repetitive, limited selection of tracksGraphics are a bit like Flash games on Kongregate or Newgrounds in style (YMMV)*Damage is not affected by movement speed, damage dealt is based on gear vs weapon. So a weapon that deals three damage to an unarmored head, will always deal three damage, whether rebounding lightly off the opponent's sword or being swung down with the wrath of heaven.In the end, Floppy Heroes totally delivers at its price point. I highly recommend this as yet another way to smack your friends around the house, and I hope the developer continues to hone their talents and release either updates or sequels, which I'd be happy to invest in.Note: Other games you might like include the original, Ragdoll Masters(10$ from dev site), Swordy (E.A.15$), Hammerfight (5$ on steam, abandonware, formerly called Hammerfall), and Rag Doll Kung Fu(10$ on steam).*denotes my biggest fault found with this game"
,Recommended,480450,31204763,Posted: 17 April,all,Nerdsomniac,"This game is stupid. I started it thinking I was going to delete it, but after one round, my friends wanted to join in, and suddenly, it was almost midnight, and we were doubling over at the stupidity of all the fun we were having.MUST BUY."
,Recommended,480450,25527504,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,Carlz0r,"This is an instant-recommend.  For this low price, you CAN NOT go wrong here. I played for over an hour in my first session, and the time flew by.  This is one of those ""one more try"" sort of games, where you're SURE you can do better if you just have one more run and try harder.  Plus, I'm sure the multiplayer will be a blast the next time I can get a friend to come over.Do any of you guys remember a little game called ""Ragdoll Masters"" from like 10 or 15 years ago?  It's kinda like that, but better, and cheaper.  Seriously, that game still costs 10 bucks and you can't even get it on Steam.  This is $3 (or $2.09 if you bought it during the first week like I did) and I would have gladly paid $10 for it.The Basics:--So the premise of this game, (and RM, which I'm sure served as some inspiration) is that you control a floppy ragdoll of a character in a zero-G arena.  The way you move determines your rotation and the positioning of your limbs based on a simple but elegant physics engine.  The goal is to beat your enemies to death, while keeping yourself from getting hurt too much.  Blows to the head are the key to victory, and you certainly want to keep your own head out of harm's way as much as possible.What's new:--So I said that this game seems to take a lot of inspiration from ""Ragdoll Masters"" but what makes it better?  Well, the biggest thing is the armor and weapons.Armor makes you slower and clumsier, depending on what type you wear, and how many pieces.. but it will soak up some hits for you, before it gets too damaged and falls off.Weapons come in 1-handed and 2-handed varieties.. you can carry any combination of 2 1-handed weapons if you desire (such as two swords, a shield and a mini-crossbow, an axe and a magic wand, etc), or a single 2-handed weapon, such as a large melee weapon, a bow and arrow, a magic staff, or a freakin CANNON.There are many types of armor and weapons to unlock, each with their own playstyles and strengths (particularly the weapons).Perhaps the coolest thing about the armor and weapons is that it adds variety to the enemies you face in the singleplayer mode.  Instead of just 1v1, 1v2, 1vGiant, 1v2 harder dudes, 1v3, 1v2 giants, etc.. you get a bit more variety because their armor and weapons will be randomized each time.  The enemies in a given round might spawn with completely different weapons than last time, which will greatly alter how you fight them.Conclusion:--This is kind of a big review for a very inexpensive game.  You don't need me to sit here and ramble on any further.  I think it's great, I think you should try it, end of story.I mean, it's not some epic end-all-be-all game of the year 2016 or whatever.. but will you get a lot of casual fun for your couple of dollars?  I think so, definitely."

BUT it's also very cheap, very addicting, and does have some complexity with the strategy.Essentially, this game is played with one-button-and-one-stick where you floatily try to kill other people.You do your worst to try to get the other people to fly or float into your weapon. There are lots of weapons and armor to unlock, and they all are kinda functionally different, too. Some weapons shoot things (where the one-button comes into play).I think anyone who plays this for about three minutes would see the charm and one-more-game kind of appeal.#YouCouldDoWayyyyWorsefor3Bucks"

I ended up playing 3 hours single player in a day which is alot for me.It's like Starwhal but with weapons/armor and shooting.The only thing that could be better is more weapons and armor.The rest is as good as it gets.

In the case of Floppy Heroes, I suppose it is, since it's only about two dollars. You swing your boneless levitating warrior around the battlefield with less-than-intuitive controls, wildly swinging whatever weapon(s) you picked up from the amorphous pile in the start menu. There's a pretty big selection of weapons to choose from, but in practice, most weapons feel indistinguishable from most of the other weapons in their category. The stats on display are really vague and hardly worth noting, but none of that matters because there's only one weapon worth choosing and I'm not telling you which.Still, the game can provide enjoyment for a few minutes at a time, so long as you spread out your play sessions with a few hours in between.
