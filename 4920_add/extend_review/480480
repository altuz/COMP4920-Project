,Not Recommended,480480,27122689,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Caomhainn,This is going to be a short one since there's not too much to say.You move around with M1 and attack with M2 if you've got enough stamina.The green bar in the upper left is said stamina and you can only attack one before it empties and you've got to wait for it to recharge.Which isn't a big deal since you can slash through multiple enemies at once.The thing is that the controls are just clunky and not working properly.At this point it honestly boggles my mind why no one really seems to mention this but I expect the controls to be somewhat fluid for this type of game and they're simply not.Basically you've got to slash enemies before they slash you since it takes one hit to kill you.Hence the name Slash or Die.There seem to be several upgrades in it which make you stronger in one way or another which I haven't had the pleasure of unlocking since I just couldn't bring myself to play the game some more.In it's current state it's absolutely impossible to recommend it since the controls are what's holding it back.Sometimes you just don't attack even if you pressed the button like a mad man.Sometimes you don't move as far as usual during a slash.Sometimes other stuff happens.It's a shame since it really looks like it'd be fun.Alas the controls are just in the way at the moment.To be completely honest I think it wouldn't be such a big deal if you'd be able to move with WASD.If that'd be the case I could handle the weird attacks and whatnot but nope.I even got so annoyed by the controls that I thought of this:NSFW

,Not Recommended,480480,30409667,Posted: 9 March,all,XJ9,"This is a very disappointing game, can't say it's THAT bad, you decide:+The one and only plus - battle mechanics - 1st time I've seen it in indiegala minigame made by the same person I guess, and what can I say - there it was WAY better - to move around you click left MB, to dash and kill you click right MB - now about the problems of the game-You can't dash while moving - you have to release LMB if you want to click RMB - like, what's the problem? When a lot of enemies around you even the slight stop can kill you.-Now even bigger problem - a lot of times when you click to dash - nothing is happening - you can click  RMB up to 2-3 times before it finally dashes, and no it's not your stamina, you have this problem even if you have 4 dashes available, but then, when you start spam right clicks to dash AND you finally dash, you can dash 4 times out of 4 stamina and waste all your stamina in half a second. That's just awful, you die 90% of the time because of that problem.-Annoying music pack: 1st of all half of the songs are simply bad, and on top of that - like 90% of the songs you can hear in like 5 different indie games (each 1$ full price, for example FBI MANIA)-No windowed mode-No controls remap-Involves a lot of grinding-boring and repetitive+steam achievements+steam cardsNo this is not a good game."

Fair enough.Slash or Dieis a coffee-break game and reminds me in some aspects ofDevil Daggerswith permanent stat upgrades.And believe me, 10 minutes goes a long way - this is something you play very briefly and pick it up later. Just likeDevil Daggers, of course.The game only uses the right and left mouse button (yeah, I know, no controller support). Left mouse button moves you around, and right makes you slash across the screen. The slash has a cooldown timer. The levels are static, and quite frankly, boring. Everything happens on one screen.Pros:+Mildly entertaining coffee-break game with an interesting minimalistic attack and move mechanic.+It is cheap.Cons:-The controls 'stick' sometimes, which is crazy annoying. Others mention this in reviews, too.-Artwork could be better. Not all pixel work is 'retro' - some of this work is a bit rough.-Some of the music is good (I'd actually say 'meh' TBO), and some is a bit irritating.-No controller support, which is desperately needed for something like this.-There could be overall more creativity - I mean stats are as basic as it can get.-Could be more playable characters (there is only one right off the bat), among other things to beef up the content. This could be much bigger than it is.Slash or Dieis a mildly entertaining coffee-break game for like three bucks.Thats about all there is to say."
76561198173606567,Not Recommended,480480,33524744,Posted: 13 July,all,KeinSchiesse,"This game is fun for a bit, to boot up and mess around with here and there. The pixel graphics and music are enjoyable, and the upgrade system (more health, stamina, speed, bleed damage, etc...) adds some variety to the gameplay. The game is a bit simplistic (which I don't mind) but the reason I don't recommend it is the limited mouse controls are annoyingly / unreliably implemented. Gameplay consists of you clicking / holding LMB to move your character around the screen toward the cursor as you dodge enemies while they constantly swarm you, with RMB being your attack / dash move (with the default character) to dispatch them or create some space between you. This is all well and good but there are often moments when your character will just not perform his RMB dash attack to evade the enemies. He just stands there with his♥♥♥♥♥♥in his hand and gets hit (or worse killed) by the enemies. This is caused because you have to fully release LMB, click RMB briefly to dash/attack then click / hold LMB again to begin moving once again. Due to the resolution and way you move your character by having him move toward the cursor, it feels like you have very little room to move once the enemies begin to fill the screen or will often accidentally dash slightly too far into an enemy and die. The holding of LMB to releasing to briefly press RMB rather than being able to just press RMB while holding LMB kills a lot of the fluidity of the game and feels inaccurate and unreliable. The game's title alludes to this being intrinsic to the gameplay, that you have to ""Slash or Die"" to make space to move around, but when the Slashing is so inconsistent your deaths are often frustrating. I suppose I could play more to ""git gud"" and learn its rhythms/hitboxes more, but I've found it to mostly just be a frustrating, idle distraction of a game with a poor interface."

It's a bit slow in the beginning, and could use some polish (it feels clunkier than it probably should, and sometimes the slash doesn't hit enemies it should), but for this price, it's a very good, very simple little game. The bosses and later enemies add some strategy into the game, and it doesn't feel like a mindless clickfest. No real, major downsides like other people have already said. It succeeds well in what it does."

This is not an amazing game but it is still pretty good and you would have a hard time finding a better game for $3.The game does feel a like a bit of a grind at times and I have an issue with some of the mechanics but it was an overall enjoyable experience.

,Recommended,480480,24909894,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,Flying Shisno,"Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was blown away by how much fun this was. You Start in an arena, and you use left click(LMB) to move, then right click(RMB) to move. You kill enemies to progress through the stages, and when you kill an enemy, you gain experience and they occasionally drop 'Souls'.Here's some info, since the game doesn't really give you much, though it's not hard to figure out. When you want to attack, be sure to let go of LMB first, else it won't attack. And keep an eye on the enemies; if they stop moving and it looks like they're gonna attack, move away from them, since they will attack, and like you they cover some distance, some further than others.Another note on attacking. In the upper left corner there are red bar(s) at the top indicating how many times you can be hit before dying. Then there are green bar(s) indicating your Stamina, which tells you how many times you can attack consecutively, meaning attacking without pause. Attacking depletes a bar, and you need to wait about 2-3 seconds for it to refill. Keep an eye on this since moving into enemy range to attack only to find out you have no stamina can easily get you killed.Under each classes card in the menu, there's an ""Upgrade"" button, click that takes you to the upgrade screen, where you use Souls to increase your skills permanently. First is the Health Upgrade, which increases your health by 1 bar. Next is the Stamina Upgrade(which looks like little green puff clouds), which increases how many times you can attack consecutively by 1 bar, Next is the Speed Upgrade(the boot), which increases your movement speed. Finally there's the Attack Upgrade(the sword), which increases your damage by 1(you start with 1). I went with upgrading Stamina, then Attack, then Health when I played, and it worked well for me.Below the Stats are 4 Passive Abilities which are different between the 3 classes. This is where leveling comes in. You can by the Abilities, but after the first Ability Tier, your character has to be a certain level to unlock the next Tier.Anyway, that's about it for tips. IDEFINITELYrecommend this game to everyone the likes action games."

It's very difficult and even after upgrading my character a lot, i still cant manage to go further than the second level's first round...Pros:- The gameplay is great, and when you achieve to do something, it feels like a treat.- The Soundtrack is pretty good. It's very much fits with the gameplay.- There are a lot of things to achieve in this game, such as the new characters, upgrades etc.- The graphics are pretty sweet, and almost feels like a pixelated Dark Souls mini-game.Cons:- The Soundtrack gets a bit dull overtime. They are too short, and repeat a lot.- The enemies have a very large attack area (Arrows hit me even though i was too far away to get hit).- U can't attack while running. This is a very big problem, and im sure its a feature, but it has to be removed. It is very annoying and caused a lot of my deaths (This is because after u stop running, u have to wait like a second before attacking or it won't work...).- The health and stamina are at the top of the screen. They should also be located on top of ur character because it's too much of a hassle to look up there, even for a brief second.Despite the cons, i still continue to enjoy this game as it is.
