I have a masters in CS. This is TERRIBLE software. It's buggy and there seems to be no help file. You click help and it takes you to a website that is an advertisement for why you should buy the app. I ALREADY BOUGHT IT. I JUST NEED THE DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO SET IT UP! But no, it wants to just try to sell me on why I should buy it. Very helpful...I never got the app to recognize that I was ever in the game no matter what I did. Maybe it was something that could have been configured to work properly but, again, no help file to show you setup tips.The mobile app is a joke. It's buggy. It says its waiting on my PC to confirm the connection but never does anything. I have to kill both the mobile app and steam and gamecaptr then start them all back up and then it connects fine. This would be fine if this were occasional but it's every other time.The app doesn't even close itself properly. If you click the icon in your tasktray and then choose the exit option that the app menu provides, this should be the best way to close an app because it is allowing the program to close itself. If you do that with this app it looks like it goes away but steam says its still running. So it doesn't close itself. You have to actually kill the steam process and then start it back up to actually close this gamecaptr app.Bottom line is that I couldn't get the thing to record or stream or even take a screenshot."

Not even by GameCaptr - Video Edit. I suppose I could try out several methods to try to make it work, but then I'd go well over 2 hours, and if nothing worked I'd be stuck with it.So, I'm refunding instead of trying to figure out what was the problem. Hate me.P.S.: The actual recording seemed to have minimal effect on game performance, but I can't say anything about the quality..."
,Not Recommended,480510,26017778,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,Ezro,"Doesn't allow you to choose different encoding drivers (like Lagarith, HEVC x265 and so on), forcing use of the pre-built accelerated drivers. This wouldn't be a downside if the quality wasn't as bad... framerates are indeed stable but audio is locked to 123kbps and sometimes video gets choppy. I really wanted to like this software but being unable to change such basic settings is a major issue for me, refunded immediately. Phone app works great though."

,Not Recommended,480510,30392604,Posted: 8 March,all,Stereomike007,"English and German review:It doesn't work with recording e.g. Unity. And the phone app is a constant crash fest. The main app aswell. The devs don't answer this forum. I wasted money on this. I deeply regret that. When I buy a software for a specific task, I expect it to work out of the box. I am not your beta tester.Deutsch:Kriege es nicht dazu, Unity aufzunehmen. Stürzt satt ab. Abstürze kann die Software super. Sowohl in der Haupt App als auch auf dem Telefon. Die Entwickler beantworten hier scheinbar seit Monaten  keine Fragen.Hätte das Geld auch verbrennen können. Wenn ich ein Softwaretool kaufe, erwarte ich dass es sofort funktioniert. Ich bin doch nicht euer  Betatester."

Game Core RevolutionBut as A LAST NOTE TO THE DEVEOPLERS The LastUpdate ♥♥♥♥ed it all up and now I can't open the software, I do not know why, I have got it to work once out of about thirteen times... This is unknow and I am going to unistall and reinstall"

A recorder and an editor.The recorder did video fine, but the audio was out and out RUINED! Everything was lost amidst a sea of piercingly, annoyingly loud static.The editor? Not worth the extra money. It's about as complex and capable as Windows Movie Maker.Do yourself a favor. Pass on this. Get anything else."

Also somehow once I run the games based on this software the game can not shut down for some reasons it just frozen at ending. Is there a way get refund?

,Recommended,480510,26260508,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,Bleach Desciple,"This recording software is alright. This is my first time using and purchasing a recording software like this and I think that it's pretty good, but it needs some work. One thing I noticed was that upon exiting the game I was recording in that it will just exit the software and steam will say that it is still running. Another thing that should go with it is the ability to record microphone audio while recording video as well. Mostly recommending this in high hope new updates will further improve this software."

Whilst recording my CPU went way too high.I dont reccomend anyone to buy this unless it just doesn't work for me."
76561198158174735,Not Recommended,480510,32377144,Posted: 12 June,all,Einspielerhalt,"The Software seems to work ""ok"" for some games.But in many cases, the videos don´t get saved at all.Furthermore, the audio quality is terrible (You have to resynchronize the audio in every record).Aditionally, this software uses a lot of your system resources what can consequently generate some unexpected FPS troubles......To sum this up, I cant really recommend this software to anyone who is interested in high quality and relyable game recording or streaming."

,Not Recommended,480510,33872765,Posted: 28 July,all,Tuffmunkee,I originally bought this software for eiting and all I have to say is save your dollars and buy sonyvegas pro or get a cracked version.Problems:Recording quality is♥♥♥♥♥♥Bes quality (if you can call it that) is slow making the video unwatchableFinally dont get the deluxe edition for the editing software it too is♥♥♥♥♥♥The editing software will randomly cut out your audio and is a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare to use. It also just doesnt feel like a nice quality video like you would want it to be as the edited video cmes out choppy and slow as well.Just to note I have never left a bad review but for 12 hours ive tried to make this work and I hate it. Please just go download SonyVegus and make actual good quality videos. Dont scam yourself here.
