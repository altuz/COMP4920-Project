,Recommended,480650,32129687,Posted: 2 June,all,saso4530,"This game is quite tough to explain. I don't know if I should say it's good or bad.Pros:+ Includes over 7484 cards.+ Deck management is magnificent.+ Very smart A.I that almost feels like playing with a human.+ Campaign mode that allows you to play duels from the Anime (all 5 arcs).+ Gameplay is very comfortable.+ The artwork is beautiful.Cons:- Card shop only includes character based boosters. It would've been better if it was similar to the card shop in the Tag Force series (character based boosters + card type based boosters).- Campaign mode lacks a lot of duels (and the DLC barely helps).- Speaking of which, DLC is garbage.- No tag dueling.- Music isn't bad, but starts feeling repetitive after a short time.In between:● Earning cards is easy.● Earning DP (Duel Points) is easy.● Campaign mode doesn't tell the story properly.I recommend this game if one or more of the following:1- You can't play an alternative.2- You want card collecting.3- You want A.I modes.I don't recommend this game if one or more of the following:1- You can play an alternative.2- You want to build decks easily.3- You want tag duels.I've found myself forced to play this game due to the fact that YGO DevPro (which is a free game) crashes with me a lot for some unknown reason. Also, I set this review to ""Recommended"" because I can't post it without recommending/not recommending it."

But I keep getting owned in two turns by things I can't even see or read in time to understand what the hell happened to my life points or the cards I had on the field. Very frustrating. Also there should be a penalty to people who quit/disconnect online games to avoid losing."

Just pinched myself :']So what are my first impressions of the game?PROS- YGO ON STEAM!!!- Responsive clicks & runs smooth (takes a tiny bit of getting used to right click to open phase menu)- Can click and hold the right mouse button to negate the card activation popup from interrupting play if you don't want to activate any cards, which works well- # of obtainable cards allow for plenty of creative yet functional deck building- Aside from using a legacy deck in story mode you can use said self created decks in Campaign mode, which is nice- The Generation Campaigns follow the key events from the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, so you're in for a trip down nostalgia lane if you've watched that or can catch up with the story if you haven't- Wooo, achievements & Steam trading cards!CONS- The Battle animations/sprites of YGO's most iconic cards look really bad in comparison to the graphics of some other Tcgs- Published by Konami, and looking at the list of DLC tells you enough about their intentions- Forced tutorial at the start of every Generation Campaign, very annoying if you're an experienced player- The annoying robots from the latest console/mobile YGO releases are back again. Like really guys, can't you replace them with a hot girl character or something? I'll even take an Apache Helicopter at this point >_>Also, despite claiming that this game has a brand new Story Campaign @About this game, it's mainly just a rehash again of key events from the YGO anime + free battles vs most characters from it, so don't expect a unique story like Reshef (ROD) or being able to roam free and challenge random duelists like in the story mode of the NDS World Championship games. The latest 5 or even more YGO games that Konami has published have been rehashes about the past/current generations, most of them not even containing a story (like Duel Generation, Millennium Duels etc). So you could say that they're not really trying anymore when it comes to European YGO fans atleast, which is a shame (Google what Konami did to the European release of Duel Carnival for the 3DS if you want to know the details).All in all, this won't be the best YGO game that you'll ever play but it's really nice to atleast have it on Steam now. And while Konami might be bleh, from a real Tcg player perspective this is still the best card game out there. Forget Magic, forget Pokemon, forget Hearthstone, forget Shadowverse, forget all of them! They cannot top the one true king of Tcgs. And if you're new to YGO and don't know what I'm talking about when I say this, then buy this game and find out! ;)P.S. If you like the gameplay mechanics of this then do yourself a huge favour and buy the GBA/NDS/3DS YGO games aswell. They are absolutely worth playing c: great way to spend time offline (so when you're travelling & don't have access to an internet connection or something, I dunno)."

To enjoy the game and make 99.99999% of decks you do not need the DLC's. However if you are trying to make a meta competative deck, some cards are locked away behind DLC. This isnt a bad thing since you can buy just the DLC with your card in it and in the end it isnt too bad.-GRINDING!!!!!-PC Port: Not many options"
,Recommended,480650,28242842,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Arixodia,"Finally a decent Yu-Gi-Oh game for PC. I would of liked to see the combat created in a holo format where we could see the monsters attacks but this seems only to be simulated for the likes of Blues Eyes White Dragon. All in all it seems a good game with a ton of content right out of the gates. The sheer amount of DLC is a little overwhelming, though.All the ""classic"" decks and cards are well represented and follow the series closely with regards to the Decks you will encounter and use in the story mode. I am only on the first part of the story with about 5 duels completed but it 's very good so far. The in game cut scenes also seem to follow the story perfectly (so far).As someone who last played Yu-Gi-Oh on Game Boy Advance and hasn't found a ""good"" Yu-Gi-Oh game since, particularly on PC, this is a welcome release."

[close-up of the Millennium Puzzle, Yuugi transforms into Yami no Yuugi]Seto: What the-?Yami: Now, Kaiba, prepare yourself, because it's time to duel.Seto: Virtual systems ready. So let's begin. I attack with the mighty Hitotsu Me Giant. Brace yourself, Yuugi. You've never dueled like this before.[Hitotsu Me Giant appears on playing field]Yami: [recoils] He's brought the monster on the card to life.Seto: It's my virtual simulator. It creates life-like holograms of every Duel Monster.Yami: So this is how you beat my grandfather. Well now it's my turn. I call on the winged dragon- Guardian of the Fortress.[Guardian of the Fortress appears on playing field]Joey: Whoa, monsters! Real monsters!Yami: Fireball attack![Guardian of the Fortress blasts Hitotsu Me Giant with a fireball. Hitotsu Me Giant shatters][enter Mokuba]Mokuba: Big brother![Seto's life-points are reduced from 2,000 to 1,800]Mokuba: Are you alright?Joey: Alright! Go Yuugi!Seto: Hah. Well played, Yuugi... for a beginner. But how will you deal with this?[Saggi the Dark Clown appears on playing field]Yami: Saggi the Dark Clown? But that card has hardly any attack strength.Seto: True, your winged dragon's attack is fourteen hundred, while my dark clown's is only six hundred, but if I combine it with this card...Yami: Ahh, A magic card!Seto: Exactly. The Negative Energy Generator. It multiplies my monster's attack by three. Dark Clown, attack with Dark Light![Saggi attacks Guardian of the Fortress. Guardian of the Fortress dissolves. Yami's life-points go from 2,000 to 1,600]Seto: As you can see, combining cards can be very effective.Yami: He's good. He knows every aspect of this game. But my grandpa put all of his gaming knowledge, his whole heart, into assembling this deck. I have to believe that it holds some secret strategy. [looks at card he's just drawn] Ah, this card is useless. I can't beat the Dark Clown with this. I'll have to use a different monster in defense mode. The monster will be sacrificed, but my overall life-points will be safe.Seto: Dark Light Attack![Yami's face-down card dissolves]Joey: Hang in there, Yuugi!Seto: You're not faring any better than the old man did, Yuugi. Your deck is just as weak and feeble as your grandfather.Yami: My grandpa is a great man, and a better duelist than you'll ever be. He entrusted me with his cards and I can feel his heart in this deck. I doubt you have that kind of faith in your cards, Kaiba.Seto: Wha-?Yami: [draws, smirks] And my faith rewards me with Gaia the Fierce Knight! With a destructive power of twenty three hundred.Seto: Ahh.[Gaia appears on playing field and attacks. Saggi dissolves. Kaiba's life-points are reduced from 1,800 to 1,300]Joey: Way to go, Yuugi!Yami: Alright, Kaiba, your move.Seto: Hah. This'll be over sooner than you think. [draws] Hmm. I call on the Blue-Eyes White Dragon.[BEWD appears on playing field]Yami: No way.Joey: Impossible! We all watched Kaiba tear that card in half.Seto: Surprised? Did you think your grandfather was the only one to possess a Blue-Eyes White Dragon?[BEWD attacks Gaia. Gaia dissolves.]Yami: Argh.[Yami's life-points are reduced from 1,600 to 900]Seto: Your Fierce Knight is destroyed. Faith or no faith, you will fall before my superior monsters, Yuugi. Power is what this game is all about, you fool. Faith is for losers... like your pathetic grandfather. In your entire deck, there's not a single card that can stand up to a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. [holds up another BEWD] So what hope do you have against two?[Second BEWD appears on playing field]Seto: Why don't you just admit defeat, Yuugi?[Cut to interior of a hospital. Solomon has an oxygen mask and is being rushed down a hallway on a stretcher]Solomon: Don't give up... Yuugi.[Cut back to the dueling platform]Yami: I won't give up. Grandpa's counting on me. [draws] Huh, a magic card. Swords of Revealing Light! It stops all monsters on the field for three turns.[Glowing swords appear around the BEWDs]Seto: How desperate. What possible good will a three turn delay do you?Yami: He's right. What do I do? I can't figure out what to do with these cards. They're just a bunch of... pieces. How can I use them to battle an expert like Kaiba?Solomon's voice: For someone claiming to have faith, you're giving up too easily, Yuugi.[Solomon appears inside Yami's head]Solomon: Listen, sometimes the cards are like a puzzle. You have to put all the different pieces in their proper place.Yami: Ahh, like the Millennium Puzzle?Solomon: Exactly. Each piece helps build a greater entity.[Solomon disappears from inside Yami's head]Yami: Grandpa!Solomon's voice: Like the pieces of a puzzle, Yuugi. Remember...Yami: Puzzle? When are the cards like a puzzle? Wait! Grandpa once said, ""Duel monsters contains only one unstoppable monster- Exodia. But he can only be summoned by drawing all five special cards. A feat that, to this very day, no one has ever accomplished.""Seto: Quit your stalling, Yuugi. Or you will be forced to forfeit the match.Yami: I never forfeit. [draws] Huh? Another piece of the puzzle.Seto: Draw any card you like, it won't change a thing. My dragons may be frozen for another two turns, but my new monster is under no such spell. The Judge Man, with an attack power of twenty-two hundred.[Judge Man appears on playing field and attacks Yami's monster, which dissolves]Yami: [draws] I can attack with the Dark Magician. But he won't stand a chance once Kaiba's dragons are free of my spell.[DM appears on playing field]Yami: Dark Magician... attack![DM attacks the Judge Man, Judge Man dissolves. Kaiba's life-points are reduced from 1,300 to 1,000]Yami: Judge Man falls.Seto: Ahh, a sacrifice that doesn't even phase me. And though neither dragon can move for one more turn, my next card is... the third Blue-Eyes White Dragon!Yami: Nngh![the third BEWD appears on the playing field]Seto: Now my dragon, attack![the BEWD attacks DM. DM dissolves. Yami's life-points are reduced from 900 to 400]Seto: So tell me, Yuugi, how's your faith now? On my next turn, all three Blue-Eyes White Dragons are free to attack. This game's over no matter what card you draw. You can't possibly stand against my three Blue-Eyes White Dragons. It's over, Yuugi. You were never a match for me.Joey: Don't listen, Yuugi!Yami: Kaiba had three Blue-Eyes all along. He only wanted my grandpa's card so it couldn't be used against him. My only chance now is to assemble all the pieces of Exodia. But the odds are against me. I don't think I can do this. Wha- [he reaches for the deck, it appears to move away from his hand] The deck! It senses my doubt! [Yami and Yuugi split for a moment] Don't lose focus, Yuugi. Don't lose faith. Concentrate! [they meld back together] Wha-? [looks down at his hand] Our friendship symbol![Téa, Tristan and Joey appear next to the deck in Yuugi's mind]Téa: Yuugi, we're right here with you.Tristan: Yuugi, you've got to believe in yourself.Joey: You can do it. Just kick Kaiba's butt.Yami: They're right. I've got to believe in the cards like my friends believe in me.Seto: Draw your last pathetic card so I can end this, Yuugi.Yami: My grandpa's deck has no pathetic cards, Kaiba. But it does contain... [holds up card] the unstoppable Exodia!Seto: Ahh! [recoils] Impossible!Yami: I've assembled all five special cards. All five pieces of the puzzle.[a blue star appears on the playing field and Exodia's limbs appear inside it, one by one]Seto: Exodia! Ahh, it's not possible! No one's ever been able to call him!Yami: Exodia Obliterate!![Exodia Obliterates]Seto: AHHHHHH!TLDR; Its a good game."

,Recommended,480650,31429011,Posted: 28 April,all,Z-One,"Here I am again, for one more review!A past few weeks ago some people did asked me to post my review about thisgame that it is one of my favorites (not to say the most) since I have beenplaying it (the TCG format) profissionaly back to 2005-2007 and 2011-2015.Yu-gi-oh, as far as I remember have always been an inspiration in my life:teamwork, friendship, hope, courage, determination, respect, honor... someof the aspects I've learned from this franchise since 1998 that influencedme to pursue my dreams and realize what I most want. I even decided,back in 2011, to make ""Z-One"" my official nickname as a tribute for myfavorite character in 5Ds generation (my favorite generation). This is just asample of my love history with this franchise!For now on i'll refer to it as LoD (Legacy of Duelist) to simplify my text.Also, in this review I gonna use the ""Pros/Cons"" format. Usually, I don'twrite my reviews using this layout but it makes itself necessarily on thisone and i'll explain why later. Let's do this!PROS:1. Amazing interfaces (good choice of color pallets, soundtrack anddigital animation);2. Excellent ambient and background design (the scenes changesalong your progress on the Campaign and even in different stages such asboss fights);3. The Campaign Mode is just FANTASTIC (the whole saga is narratedin the five generations presented on it with rich text details);4. Good servers for online matches (at least, I have never hadproblems with it and I play on matchmaking most of the time);5. Challenge Mode, the best part of LoD and i'll tell you why: justa few players did noticed but the decks used by the AI duelists inchallenge mode ARE REAL DECKS DESIGNED AND USED BY REAL META-PLAYERS! It'samazing to play against Weevil's Inzektor and realizes that it is actuallythe same deck used by Akikazu back in 2012. Pretty much all of theopponents in Challenge Mode are dueling with real decks used by realplayers of the professional circuit;6. Excellent mechanics (in general);7. Rewards system working fine (drops in the aftermatches and easyduel points farming which grants a fast collection of cards via shop);8. Possibility of using banned cards, this is an important point tosalute... a few days later when I first bought the game, a friend of minedid it as well but, there was a problem, he just recognized Yu-gi-oh bythe classic series and usability. Having the banned cards ALLOWED to beused against AI opponents made him adapt pretty well with the new scene andgeneration (from someone who could barely understand a fusion mechanic tomaking his own combos with XYZ, Synchro and Pendulum);9. DLC's contents pretty good (in general)!CONS:1. Buying boosters... Wow, we MUST talk about this xD... I just...I simply can't understand why we could not buy more than one booster at atime. I mean, we have to buy a booster that contains 8 cards, wait theanimation, see the cards, then do it again... Couldn't we just buy forexample, 10 boosters and open them immediately like it is in the portablegames series? I mean, seriously... the time we spend opening thisboosters...2. Crashes... it happens to me sometimes. Playing against AI,online matches... the games closes itself and that is it. Also... there isa strange bug that sometimes the game simply don't ""save"" your progress.For example, you buy some boosters, gets new cards, then, when you closesthe game and comes back... it's gone for good, the game just didn't savedthe changes or progress;Now... I would like to talk more about my experience and even suggestionsmainly about LoD. The thing is:This game had a TERRIBLE publicity. It was released back in 2015 now, I askyou (doesn't matter if you are a long term fan of the franchise or a newone): Have you heard of this game before dec 2016?I don't know why exactly this happens with most of Konami's products(mainly Yu-gi-oh ones) but it is a full disgrace for the franchise and thecompany itself. I am from Brazil and in my country back to 2000s when wehad the ""boom"" of Yu-gi-oh, the franchise was well known, played and lovedwith a vast community and large group of fans. I always wondered myselfwhat could have happened for this scene to drastically changes. Today,brazilian yu-gi-oh franchise survives along small communities located indesolated game stores, tiny spaces to play, informal tournaments and groupsof casual players and we are talking about the 11th biggest consumer marketof games on the planet and the 3rd market that it is in expansion. Also,when I was in US back in 2014-2015 I noticed the same. Only in Japan, whenI visited in 2012 I could notice a great and good community...Expanding the franchise to new customers is really important such asregaining the old customers interests (that ones... that shopped and lovedthe franchise but today, consider it dead and don't even knows that Yu-gi-oh is still happening, anime, TCG/OCG, paraphernalia, events...)Something that does bothers me is the future of this game. I feel that weare ""abandoned"" (the game and us), no updates, no announcements, nopatches, not even new DLCs... I can't say if this happened because of DuelLinks or if Konami is working in a new videogame. What I know is that infact, we are a small community!!!The average amount of players in game is 331according steamcharts readingof last 30 days. We are a small community but in fact, I also have to say:We are a true and loyal one...CONSIDERATIONS:I see a lot of people complaining about the battle animations and it istrue... but before that I would say that wasn't even necessarily to animatesome monsters, I see that a lot of people wanted something similar withForbidden Memories but as I see... is not needed mainly because a highanimation production would distress the game's dynamics, we would lose thefastness. I even get bothered when I summon Utopia and HAVE to watch hisanimation each time I attack a monster with him... Imagine if all monsterswere animated... About the graphics itself, I have no complains, I like thecartoonized models and the simple shading as well the low emitter particlesystem!Another thing, about the DLCs amount... YES, there are a lot of DLCs butthe purchasing option is up to you! I really can't see a casual playerbuying these DLCs and it's only because a casual player is up to only playfor the AI battle, cards collection, challenge mode... friend playing...The ones that I know that buy DLCs (including me) are people interested inthe ranked game, online duels and/or long term fans.Others complains about the game being too easy and the AI lazy... surely you haven't played Challenge Mode using a clear deck (no banned cards or Exodia FTK).Now, the most important point of my review.Why you should buy this game?I see a lot of people reluctant to migrate from Ygopro. Just tries to understand that without the incentive (that comprehends public acceptance, community and fanbase) Konami simply doesn't have a concrete motive to invest in digital entertainment on Yu-gi-oh franchise besides the TCG format... try it! Take the game, play it, complain it, criticize it, give your suggestions... let's show them that we are a great community (in quality and number). The company will attend our demand and invest more in our beloved franchise, it is they interest after all.I wrote this review in a different format that I usually do and I did itbecause I hope and dream of a day when my favorite franchise will rise onceagain and makes itself a place in our hearts, that's because Yu-gi-oh havea lead, a powerful one...NOSTALGIA!!Final Grade: 9/10.Duelists, don't abandon Yu-gi-oh;Konami, don't abandon Us!"

The game will take you through all the pieces of the anime you remember starting off with cards you know of and then adding them in as you go. This game actually doesn't have up through the newest card sets sadly, but it does have the majority of the way through.The story mode is great and seems to follow the show perfectly so far (granted I can only confirm for Yugioh Vanilla, as I never watched any of GX onwards).TLDRIf the statement ""I haven't played or seen Yugioh since I was a kid, but am interested in reliving that."" sounds like you, get this game."

,Recommended,480650,28281410,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,Bwettfett,"We finally got an official Yugioh release on PC that isn't Power of the Chaos! While this game doesn't come with those spiffy looking anti-spell fragrances, it does come packed with the most cards in any Yugioh game ever. All the way up to Shining Victories, this covers the TCG/OCG from the beginning to roughly Early 2016. It is missing stuff from TDIL and INOV unfortunately but it's a welcome update to the vanilla release on console.This game has tons of content for a $20 release, there's a fairly long story mode with duels from the show, there's battle pack draft and sealed play, online multiplayer and single player v AI quickplay.  The booster pack aspect is something that I enjoyed, but the contents of the packs are completely random (Why are Infernoids in a Bakura pack for instance?)It does take some grinding to get anywhere decent with a non-story deck, and the story decks are mostly trash. I mean AWFUL. The deck for Yugi from his very first duel against Kaiba is literally pot of greed, swords of revealing light, heart of the underdog and vanilla monsters. Honestly I would've rather the draws be hard scripted or something because I was being forced to surrender and unable to do anything for multiple turns in one of the very first matches. That's not a good thing.The interface is pretty bad. There's really frustrating prompts to chain card effects constantly and unlike YGOpro you can't just skip them.Speaking of, while I purchased this game to support further GOOD releases from Konami, there's no real reason to play this over YGOpro. Losing Duelingnetwork was a blow to testing online, but this doesn't really replace that. I really doubt people are going to grind to build meta decks for a format that we left almost a full year ago in an interface that is not very intuitive in comparison to  devpro or something. For a casual fan or a moderately competitive player there's not real glaring flaws here, The single player alone is worth picking up if you enjoy any of the classic GBA games or the tag force series. There's also a small amount of animations for some of the ace monsters, which was a nice touch.tl;dr - if you're looking to test your zodiacs, metalfoes or ABC, you literally can't here. But if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive yugioh video game, this is the best thing we've gotten since the PS2 days."

Dislike the new cards, but still want to play Yu-gi-oh like how you remembered it?Then this game is for you! You can choose the era you are most familar with and they use the cards within that era.As someone who really thinks the 5Ds era was the best with the motercycles and Synchro monsters, this is great as I can recreate my childhood deck and duel with Ais that had deck similar to my time. The Ais are also really challenging and offer a good fight.The DLCs are not required almost every card is in the game. Only a thousand are missing compared to ten thousand.Only cons are it doesn't come with physical cards and it does't support my Surface Pro 4 resolution. It wish it had better touchscreen mode.This game makes a great game for 5 minute breaks from studying.This game really makes me want to rebuild my plant deck. The only thing stopping me is the fact that I am missing a special Stardust Dragon card. :("

However, with only 30 or so cards left in a set you start to get between 0 - 2 new cards per pack with the majority seeming to be on the zero side.I farmed up around 120,000 points which ""almost"" got me a set and a half and if this was a freemium game that would likely feel fine. But it's not, we paid a decent entry price so would it kill them to cut us some slack?The actual opening of card packs is one of the games weakest elements with four clicks of the enter key and a short, unskipable, soundless and boring opening animation to open each. (Seriously get a keyboard macro or there is some serious wear heading the way of that button x.x)Needs an option to open x10 x50 x100 packs at a time and removal of the duplicates(or at least compensation for them, again, this isn’t a fermium title, cut the bs)On a seprate note there are also attack animation for some of the series more well known cards. This is neat the first time but after the fourth time watching a mega low poly blue eyes doing it's time wasting animation AND no option at all to turn these off.. yeah.Let's not forget the game reminders fourteen times a turn, asking you if you want to activate that trap/spell card! The did try to solve this with three different option menu settings.The first, game gives you prompts everytime the action is available.The second, the game gives you prompts when it feels it is appropriate. Except this is functionally the same as the first option with the game constantly bugging me to use my buff a creature cards when only my opponent has monsters on the field.. #SmarterSimsThe third, you must hold a button if and when you want prompts to activate card effects. Which alot of the time leads to you missing them entirely if you want to focus on anything but the game.Conclusion on this point is can't live with it, can't live without it. The crutch the prompts give players like me who play casually and may not recognise in time when a card should have been used makes the prompt spamming the lesser of the two evils imo.A late edit but further play has shown a rather bothersome bug. When opening packs, leaving then closing the game via the main menu may cause the opened packs not to register and you will log back in next time as if you never spent 10minutes hitting enter.Even entering then surrendering a match has at kept this problem and while useful if you want to use this as a type of save scumming, it is irritating none the less."

This game is much less ""konami"" then i expected and seems to have a fair pricing model.Will it make me give up YGO Pro? yeah i think it will it covers what i need in a yu gi oh game pretty much and its offical so i dont have to risk it being dcma'd by #♥♥♥♥onamiIf it continues to get updates I don't see why i should swich back to YGO Pro but the ball is is Konami's court.

,Not Recommended,480650,33654033,Posted: 19 July,all,♔ Aryamehr ♔,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game. The multiplayer is almost dead, and there are some bugs here and there but won't ever be fixed because the devs don't care about this anymore. Even if you do manage to find people online, you gotta watch out for ragequitters, as quitting a match doesn't count as a loss for the quitter. It doesn't affect your score, but some people ragequit anyways.However, if you don't care about the multiplayer, or just really want to have the only Yugioh game on Steam, I'd say go for it. That's what long-time Yugioh fans would do as well. Still wouldn't say if it's worth full-price. And well, the game just never goes on sale either, nor does any of the dlc.That being said, this game has thousands of cards to gain and could be very fun when playing with a friend. There are just so many decks you can either build yourself or copycat from famous deck recipes.Will I keep playing it? Yes, now and then. Would I recommend it to anyone? No."
,Recommended,480650,28311813,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,Lera Kort,"At last, an official Yugioh PC game.I love the Yugioh trading card game, but was forced out of it when my IRL friends stopped playing it. I hated the unofficial PC games like DEVpro and DuellingNetwork, I was too casual (and cheap) to actually go to tournaments everytime I was in the mood to duel and I feel like consoles aren't a great way of playing card games. But finally my prayers were answered when this game was released on steam.You can go through the storylines of all 5 current Generations of Yugioh and play as/ or against your favorite characters. There is a tutorial in the game too, so people wanting to get into the franchise won't get alienated. You can build and use your own decks to either use in single player against the anime characters, or you can go online in both casual and ranked battles. This is pretty much everything I would have wanted from a Yugioh game, with the only minor disapointment being the DLC.It's important to note that the DLC isn't a deal breaker in the slightest. There aren't microtransactions and it doesn't lock off any of the actual cards for you. The cards are instead bought using in game currency that you earn from winning matches. All the DLC does is unlock a few more levels in the single player campaign and throw in a few starter decks so you'll be able to get certain cards and archetypes faster. So whilst a little dissapointing, the DLC is fair and can easily be avoided if you mainly play the multiplayer.So yeah, Konami actually did something pretty cool for once and I'd recommend this game to pretty much any Yugioh fan, even the ones that vaguely remember watching Duel monsters as a kid and want to relive Yugi's best moments."

,Recommended,480650,28906657,Posted: 1 January,all,Starwing6,"Yu-Gi-Oh! is the best Trading Card Game ever created, in my opinion.  It's easy to learn, but it requires a lot more strategy than most TCGs.  For years, I had no one to play the game with, and I even tried a few other card games to try to find a replacement... but I was never satisfied with any of them.That's why I'm thrilled that Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist is on Steam.  As soon as I saw it in the store, I knew I had to have it!  I didn't even watch the promotional video, so I wasn't aware of all the game's features when I began playing.  I was surprised and impressed by the special Kill Cam animations that certain cards have.Thankfully, there are no micro-transactions in the game (I'd go broke LOL).  You win new cards and points for an in-game card shop by playing the campaigns.  The base game includes 5 single-player campaigns that follow the main storylines of the first season for each of the Yu-Gi-Oh! animated shows.  You get to play against all the classic heroes and villians, and can play with the same decks used in the show, or use your own custom deck.  If you play the Story Deck, certain cards are weighted to come up first so you can play the same strategy from that match on the show, if you want.  After winning a duel in the campaign, you can reverse the characters and play the other character (with the Story Deck or a custom one), and win more by replaying the duels.The nostalgia factor is extremely high with this game, and theOld-School feelsmake it a true joy to play.  If you've never played Yu-Gi-Oh! before and/or never saw the animated shows, I'm sure you would love this game if you're into Trading Card Games at all.  Plus the cute anime style will probably make you smile.Duels are typically fast-paced and are won with strategy, rather than luck.  There is no ""mana system,"" and players can only have 5 monsters on the board at one time.  A lot of other games have no limits and can result in massive, drawn-out battles with dozens of cards in play.  That's boring, and I don't think Yu-Gi-Oh! ever gets boring."

You get DP just by surrendering, but you get triple the amount by winning. Grind the way you want.2. When you win against an NPC you get 3 random cards (that you don't own) from their decklist.3. The game saves after a battle or when you exit deck edit. This means you can buy boosters in bulk and exit the game if you don't get the card you want; log back in and your DP will be reset.4. Beat the ARC-V Campaign first - it's a single tutorial level - and unlock 3 boosters with the most recent cards in the game. These boosters have powerful archetypes like Burning Abyss, The Phantom Knights, and Odd-Eyes/Performapal/Magician5. We have fantastic fan support: thecardhub and the Yu-Gi-Oh wikia have lists for every booster and decklist. Use these to find the archetype you want to play, and grind away.The biggest con is the DLC. Some powerful archetypes and important generic support cards are locked away in DLC, and I don't think they'll go on sale anytime soon."

,Recommended,480650,34106699,Posted: 8 August,all,Jackie Brown,"General: This game is quite addictive, which makes it good in my opinion. I used to love POC, so I was happy to find this game which seemed to be an upgraded POC. It turns out it's worth the money for sure.Pros:- Interesting campaigns with variety of duelists and decks.- Challenging AI, although they always use the same deck.- Thousands of cards available to create your own fully-customized deck.- Good shop system, rare cards are indeed rare.Cons:- I never really understood this battlepack mode, it's a bit weird and not really self-explanatory.- A couple of cards seem to be a bit buggy. (eg. Backfire, inferno reckless summon)- Some cards are overpowered, whereas some innocent cards are restricted.- Xyz, synchro and pendelum monsters kill the game for those who prefer oldschool yugioh. These cards can be summoned to the field way too easily and are way too overpowered with all kinds of effects to which you can barely defend yourself.- No drawing if you are first to go. Wtf?- Multiplayer could be improved a lot:++ Players use too many overpowered cards (There are some restrictions, but funny enough raigeki is allowed)++ Small player base++ No punishment on forfeiting (and no win for the remainer either)++ Your rank is based on the amount of wins only. Why not also record losses and introduce a rating system?++ Add an option to fight without xyz, synchro and pendulum++ Lobby system: Why not just add a queue that automatically finds you an opponent and sets up a duel for you? Saves waiting in a lobby with afk players.- DLCs: Seem too expensive to buy them all"

You start out with several fairly balanced, but not impressive, decks and can unlock more as you do campaigns.  If you feel creative, you can make your own too.This is more in-line with some of the DS games, and I always felt this was a better system of working. You get to steadily learn new cards and what they do as well as play with decks built around a concept to grasp your own.  Unlike the DS games though, the intro decks are a little bit more powerful.  With the old DS games, you had to start with a bunch of cards that *barely* won you through the game and you ended up picking the battles that you could beat easily to progress.  And believe me, this was no walk in the park.There are also a lot more cards to play with then those games, their more in-depth and the game is pretty solid.  I'm not a yugioh fan, but the video games for DS were good IMO.  This, improves on what they had 10X and gives you more to play with."
,Recommended,480650,30456838,Posted: 11 March,all,YOM2,"After trying Duel Links and being very annoyed with the 3 monster/spell&trap zones, I decided to search steam for a game that would hopefully be a more accurate representation of the source game. This game did not dissapoint.Pros:+ As previously mentioned, it's an accurate represention of the original card game. If Duel Links bugs you as much as it does me, then give this a shot.+ Lengthy story mode that lets you play through some major duels in the first four to five (see below for separate DLC pros and cons) Anime series. You always play as the character who's supposed to win, so there are no ""you have to lose"" situations.+ Given the option to play with story decks based on the cards udes in the anime, but you can also play against anyone with decks you've made yourself.+ You start with enough cards for a few structure decks, and unlocks packs with story progression. More fun to open packs than have every card from the beginning, after all.+ Playing a single duel in any mode (with the possible exception of the online matches that I've yet to try), you always earn enough Duel Points to buy at least a pack or two, even if you lose. Winning usually nets you enough for three or four packs. (My biggest gripe with the 5Ds game on the Nintendo DS was that you had to win around five duels to buy a sing pack.)+ Reverse duels unlock after beating each story mode level, where you play with the deck who is supposed to lose, but try to win anyways. Screw canon! (Can be played with story or your own decks, of course.)+ Challenge Decks unlock after you defeat each instance of a single character in Story Mode (regular and reverse), where you play a more powerful deck based on that character's usual theme. Can only be played usuning cards you own.+ Very large library of cards avaliable. I have over 3000 and still haven't unlocked any 5Ds or Zexal packs, nor bought many Arc-V packs. Includes Syncro, Xyz, and Pendulum cards, as well as the original monster, spell, trap, fusion, and ritual cards.+ Defeating any deck in story or challenge mode unlocks a schematic for the deck. You can start a new deck with a schematic and then edit it to your liking, or play any level with a schematic you own all the cards for by selecting user deck.+ Losing any story/challenge duel gives you one card from the opposing deck. Winning gives you three, and if the deck has a signature card, the first time you win you will always get it.+ One tutorial in each story series. Original series gives basics on how the game works, GX shows off fusion monsters, 5Ds shows Syncro monsters, Zexal shows Xyz monsters, and Arc-V shows off pendulum cards.+ Tutorials are skippable, just press 3/middle click to play them as non-tutorial duels.+ Lets you build decks with banned cards. Probably not in ranked multiplayer though. (My second biggest gripe with the 5Ds game I mentioned earlier was that everybody used banned cards, but you couldn't use any at all.)Ehhs:= Some important monsters like Dark Magician (and Girl), Blue Eyes White Dragon, Relinquished etc. have battle animations. These are fairly low quality, which is a good thing on less powerful hardware, but a bit annoying on more powerful hardware.Cons:- Crashes sometimes. And for bad reasons. I've only crashed three times in 60 hours, once for no reason, and twice for attacking with a King of Skull Servants that had 10,000 attack.- Can be hard to scroll the card text or open a card's full-screen description.- If you aren't holding backspace/right click to skip card activation prompts, can be extremely annoying to have a trap card set or an instant-speed spell set or in your hand. Just make sure to trudge through prompts if you feel you might want to activate it soon.- There is nothing in the Arc-V story in the base game except the Pendulum tutorial without DLC. Kind of lame.DLC+ Adds a bunch of new cards and two story duels each, as well as challenge decks for each new character.= Automatically gives you three of each new card, rather than giving you new packs or adding to old ones.- Quite expensive to buy all the DLC packs.

If you're wanting to play a singleplayer campaign and some multiplayer on the side this may the game for you.The campaigns are broken up by series (Original, GX, 5DS, etc.) so you can start with whatever series you like best. In each of the story duels you can choose to use the deck of whatever character you are filling in for or a deck of your own construction. After each duel you recieve cards and in-game currency that you can use to buy booster packs, (that are unlocked for purchase by story progress), to supplement your own deck building.The story missions are great if you want to relive the Yu-Gi-Oh stories you know and love, however some of the story decks are flat out bad (Joey) and it can feel like RNG rather than strategy got you the win/lose. There are also more difficult challenge duels outside the story where a character will have an amped up version of their deck and you can win cards that are rare or not available in the regular packs.Speaking of not available in packs the DLC does contain exclusive cards. If that isn't a deal breaker on its own you may want to look up and see if any cards you will care about are in a DLC pack. For the most part the DLC contains newer cards  and archetypes or newer support for older archetypes (for example, Masked HEROs). If all you want is to play is the story and some casual duels with some friends you can live without any DLC.There are also plenty of tutorials for people new or coming coming back to Yu-Gi-Oh, however they are annoying if you already know how to play.Overall, there is a good amount of singleplayer content available in the base $20 game. If you want that and some casual pvp duels with friends this game is probably worth your time. If you want to be more competitive or don't care about not having singleplayer or the DLC is a turn off, look into one of the free simulators like YGOpro."

,Recommended,480650,33318070,Posted: 6 July,all,Beriorn,"Played the duel between Kaiba and Yugi in the campaign from Kaiba's point of view. Yugi beats me by pulling out Exodia. 10/10 true to the source material.Pros and consProsThousands of cards to build a deck from.Comprehensive tutorial for new players and veterans alike.The game is about playing Yu-Gi-Oh, no unnecessary nonsense.No need to own several dozens of the same card if you want to use them in multiple decks.Mechanics range from the classic all the way up to Synchro, XYZ and Pendulum summoning.You can save up to 32 self-made decks, on top of the hundreds of pre-built decks that can be unlocked.Starter decks are pretty good, unlike certain other Yu-Gi-Oh games (I'm looking at you, Eternal Duelist Soul).More cards are obtained by just playing the game; if you win a duel you get enough cash to buy a few card packs so your collection always grows.The story campaigns are split along the lines of the various anime/manga series. You can start at any of them and can complete your unlocked missions in any order. Aside from the first duel of each campaign they can also be played from the point of view of the opponent, almost perfectly doubling the number of available missions.Loads of single player content, with each duel involving going up against another deck.AI is competent : it's not omniscient but if it has the cards it will wreck you.For the first time you can play Sealed and Draft digitally.ConsGetting specific cards is a pain: buying a card pack gets you 8 random cards from a set of 265, and you can own a maximum of three cards each. Duplicates are simply lost. This makes a 100% collection rate a nightmare.Multiplayer is a mess of people with overpowered decks with which they can wreck you in a turn or two or disconnect if they start to lose... if you can even find a player that is.The options for getting a message if you want to play a certain card are a mess: you have to choose to get them either at every opportunity, at some opportunities or at none. In the first two cases you can hold a button to ignore them (and with the third you have to hold it to GET the messages, so this is for pros only), which is an unfortunately annoying but required element of playing digitally.The campaign is based on the stories of the anime/manga series, but not all of it. For example, the campaign based on the original series goes up to the end of the second season, then jumps to the final duel of the series and skips three entire seasons. On top of that, the presentation is done by ways of a summary of the events surrounding particular duels, accompanied by still images of the characters involved against a flat background.When attacking with a sufficiently important monster (Dark Magician, Blue Eyes White Dragon and so on) you get a 3D animation of said monster attacking, but the animation is not all that flashy and the model quality is rather lacking.The many DLC packs hide a lot of content. At 17 packs that are $5 each you are looking at four times the base price of the game. These packs contain at least two complete decks with cards not found in the base game (the Declan VS Celina pack has three decks) and a number of scenarios. Ten of the packs are related to the ARC-V story, three to the original series, two to GX and one each for 5D's and ZEXAL. Whether or not they are worth it is up to the individual: look up what cards are in them before deciding to buy. Many of these decks contain rather powerful cards of a specific archetype.The passcode system is not implemented, which is regrettable in a game with such a MASSIVE card base.Using the keyboard to play is a hassle: using a controller makes the game a lot easier to play.The arenas in which you play are not interesting to look at and get boring fast.The deck building interface is somewhat clunky.Not a lot of variation in the background music.Aside from deckbuilding and playing single player there's not a lot else to do.Should you buy this game?You should buy this game if you...love the Yu-Gi-Oh card game and want to play a lot of it.want to use all sorts of cards that you could never all afford in real life.want a complete card game experience without having the dread free-to-play elements shoehorned in.don't mind playing the same game over and over again.You should not buy this game if you...want a good online multiplayer mode.want a good story with lots of engaging storytelling.cannot handle the AI beating you when you're about to win.hate having powerful content walled off behind the barrier of DLC.want to experience the full plots of all series of Yu-Gi-Oh, even when buying DLC.dislike hearing the same music and seeing the same backgrounds over and over again.are an avid completionist who hates being taunted by the fact that you only need one more cards to get a complete set.want to play the Traditional format online as well as Advanced (Traditional allows a lot more cards than Advanced does, including many older and powerful ones).hate those newfangled Synchro, XYZ and Pendulum summoning things and want to play the ""real"" Yu-Gi-Oh. While not all decks have these cards, decks used even in older duels will be surprisingly recent.want a game that is being constantly updated. The game uses the April 2016 ban list and a card list that was recent in mid-2016. The creators are done with the game now, so don't expect more cards, updates on the rules or Link Summoning.have people on your friends list who'll mock you for playing a children's trading card game.don't like anime.Verdict: Recommended for fans of the genre, the Yu-Gi-Oh card game and the series.If you like card games with lots of customization and loads of valid options, this is the game for you. Loads of options are available, paired with lots of single player content and almost seven and a half thousand cards (counting DLC) available to play a lot of games with. A lacking online mode and a somewhat clunky interface hamper the fun, but not by too much. Some cards are hidden behind a DLC barrier, but because of the modular nature of the DLC you can pick your favorites.Hints and TipsPretty much everything, from card packs and battle packs to duelist challenges and character avatars, is unlocked by playing the campaign.The two numbers listed under character packs are the number of cards from that pack you own, and the maximum total of cards you can own from that pack (which is three of each card from said pack). If you own all cards from a pack the numbers vanish.Change when the game asks you about if you want to use certain cards in the options menu.USE A CONTROLLER.If you win a duel you get, on top of everything else, three cards that are in the deck that your opponent just used. If you lose you get one. Unlocking a deck allows you to see what cards are in that deck and you can duel that opponent multiple times to get a lot of their cards.This means that the second-quickest way to grind cards of a particular deck is to build an extremely overpowered deck that can take your opponent out in a few turns, and the quickest is to immediately surrender when the duel starts. This allows you rapidly grind for whatever cards are in your opponent's deck.The Card Hub is a website that allows you to find if your favorite cards are in the game and where you can unlock them.If you want to see what's in each card pack that you buy in game you can check the Yu-Gi-Oh fan wiki.Final ThoughtsIt's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-DUEL!"

That doesn't matter though I've played Hearthstone, Might & Magic: Duel of Champions, Magic the Gathering multiple versions and Duelyst. To keep it simple and short this might not top any of these games but it's done well enough that you can enjoy this, what truly matters is how Yu-Gi-Oh plays and that's what makes it stand out from the rest!The good keyboard and mouse work well, there's also full controller support too. There is a full story mode with story mode deck builds that you can use... feels just like the show/anime, if you don't like them you can always use your own custom deck for story mode as well. The story mode rewards you with cards, points etc! Which it should or else it would be pointless but they get pretty deep with the rewarding it's fun. The game has about 6000 something cards in the core game and 7000 with DLC, now that's alot of cards to play with which is great! The deck building is pretty damn fleshed out here too you'll spend hours testing and tinkering unless you already know what card does what. The soundtrack is alright there's 3 or 4 songs but it keeps the mood going. The art is awesome and it does bring back good old memories, also everything is flashy and colourful enough for a card game!The bad well the controls are really off at first but you get use to them, they could have done a better job with it! Like I said before the rewards are fun but the grinding on the other hand is not some can live with it others can't. I'm kind of in the middle ground with it, somedays I can be bothered other days I can't. The multiplayer has some issuses private lobbies don't work at all and there is also no anti cheat, luckly you can still invite friends in a public match. The battlefields look cheap but I suppose every field in every card game I've played has a cheap feel to it except Duelyst but that game is a different beast.In the end some pros and cons merge with each other but overall it's a great game for the price... it's time to D-D-D-D-DUEL!"

,Recommended,480650,29009123,Posted: 4 January,all,P1sTa,"To be honest I was really skeptical about this official YGO game being released. Having played since 2002 (both physically and digitally) and having also invested money in the old YGO Online, it makes you wonder why they stopped including the old grindy style of card obtaining and features people actually liked, something I've not seen since the NDS games.Legacy of the Duelist not only brings back the much loved style of card obtaining, but it essentially makes it F2P, with very few cards that require DLCs, being this ones also additional campaign duels that justify the cost. Pretty much whatever you want to build, even meta decks, can be built without paying extra money.The campaign is so awesome, especially DM/GX, that some of my friends that haven't played since Synchros came out have enjoyed the nostalgia-driven story. We all agree that allowing Story decks to be chosen is the best idea that Konami has had, since this has brought back the ""old guard"" of Yu-Gi-Oh back to playing the game. Battle pack duels also make playing with friends quite enjoyable, considering it's pretty much straightforward and doesn't require the players reading each and every one of the effects.As an old player that quit the physical game 4 years ago I haven't tried online ladder yet, since I don't care about the competitive meta and all I want is to be able to have fun and build cool decks to test. The amount of offline and friendly play available allows casual and old players alike to enjoy the game without having to play against tryhard-ish people, something that cannot be said about other PC alternatives. The banlist not affecting offline play also allows to try old-school decks that could only be played in platforms like NDS after enabling the No-Banlist cheat.Of course the game has huge room for improvement. Some of the suggestions would be:- Duel Puzzles (official and fanmade) that a lot of people seemed to enjoy- Deck recipe duels- Tag duels- Offline tournament mode- Frequent patches (Bugfixes, new format, new cards)Pros+ Essentially F2P+ Cool campaigns for both old and new players+ Various modes for unlimited fun+ Traditional 5 zone mode (I hate those 3 monster zone YGO games I've seen lately)+ Very intuitive tutorials and interfaceCons- Too many DLCs, some too pricey for what they offer- A few times the game has crashed without any reason-Bulk pack opening not available, also pack opening slow (why would you not copypaste this from NDS games?)- Adding cards to/removing from the deck could be easier (like right-click on mouse)ConclusionFinal mark: 8.5/10The game can be improved, but it's on the right path and is definitely on par or better than the PC competition. Konami has finally placed its bet on PC and boy is this a good way to start."

Finishing the duel once unlocks reverse duels and challenge mode duelist- Challenge mode lets you play against Story characters but with a strong and competitive themed deck (e.g Mako Tsunami running Gishkis, etc.). Completing all stories unlocks around 90+ duelists- Online mode where you can duel other players.- DLC isn't a consumable currency like how most games are nowadays that would nickle and dime you.Cons:- Oozes low budget in every corner since presentation are barebones but understandable for the asking price- Too expensive DLCs, I reckon $2.99 would be a decent asking price. Though DLC is not mandatory, some very specific cards and archetypes are locked behind the paywall.- Quality of life settings like option to turn off/speed up animations, buy multiple card packs and open at the same time, manual saving,etc. are absent.- Unable to set matches without banlist even when you are playing in a non-ranked match- Lack the ability to give an AI a deck to use and duel against. This feature has been a staple in Tag Force/World Championship games on the DS and it sucks that it is not present here.All in all the game is worth the asking price though it is a bit rough around the edges. Grab only the DLCs that you really want but it isn't mandatory. Take a friend or a few to play with in order to fully enjoy the game.

It goes over all the stories of every generation and all the important duels using your own deck or the deck that person had at the time. It also allows you to duel friends and randoms online and earn points for new cards. It's clear lots of effort and love went into making this game. It may have not been on sale when I bought it, but it was worth every penny.There aren't many downsides to this game I can think of... but if I have to list some small ones... not enough people online for multiplayer, dlc isn't really worth it, No triple duels (but idk what those are), and... Not every card is in the game. But there are so many it doesn't really matter and they mostly removed the bad ones no one ever uses.If your a yu-gi-oh fan, or even played the games a bit in the past I would highly recommend buying this game when you can."

If it lands on your choice, destroy all monsters on your opponents side of the field. If it doesn't destroy your monsters on field instead.

I'I'd bet money it is obviously not as expensive to produce new content as say a Paradox game because the game is just fairly simple to present. It's an easy game to design. Not that I did, but compared to a game like Europa Univeralis which on sheer number follows a similar DLC scheme, the content is much more involved to produce as they're not working with a game that is fundementally already designed on paper.Regardless I like the game, and if you're still a fan of the card game, or a new one and wanting an official PC game, I suppose you have it here.Not much to say really, it's a Konami Yu-Gi-Oh game. And to be fair, as another reviwer mentioned, the DLC packs while numerous are priced slightly more than a pack of actual Yu-Gi-Oh cards and I, and my parents bought hundreds so, I suppose I can forgive it in that regard.I've had a few more hours with the game, about 4 total I believe and so I felt like I'd add a bit more info.The game lacks voice acting, I would have liked if they used the original voice acting or actual scenes from the show. The lack of voice acting is similar to all Yu-Gi-Oh games I've played, but I feel like licensing issues not in consideration, in 2016 a release by a major company should include voice acting.It doesn't need to include every episode of the series, but a few scenes would really add to the game.There are also no monster models besides a few such as Blue Eyes white dragon. I understand the reasoning for this, because modeling thousands of creatures would be an incredible amount of labor, but I'd like a few animations more than is included.The music is very repeptitve.

Things that bothered me, were some bugs such a Chain Trap cards, that get destroyed once the monster it is chained to dies, they're supposed to be moved to the graveyard, which most of the time doesn't happen and so blocks a space on the play board, you can't replace them or discard them to put another card on there, which in my memory was something you could do in YuGiOh originaly. Also forget about winning in Rock Paper Scissor, the game makes you lose more times than actually win, there are bugs that need to be ironed out, but in the mean time is an awesome game. Also, it may bother you, but every card is labeled with the Game's titles in the corner of the picture, which is lame, but you get used to it."

Since then, I stumbled upon this and haven't been disappointed. It stays true to the card game and is fun to play. After watching some gameplay videos I was skeptical that the game would satisfy the $20 pricetag but after making the purchase I can say it was worth it. There's an insane amount of content. 5 hours of gameplay and I'm maybe 2-3% done with the campaign and still have hundreds upon hundreds of cards to collect. I've barely scratched the surface.The story mostly consists of cutscenes from the show. You follow the basic story, which isn't very well explained in the game but those familiar with it already will be pleased. I'm a little concerned about how this will affect my experience later on as I never watched the later seasons / expansions / editions / whatever you'd like to call them. Throughout the campaign you can also use ""story decks"" which are premade decks that are essentially made to combat what you're facing in your opponent (highly recommended).  The artwork is done well and the game's tutorial is executed properly for the most part. The deck editor can be intimidating and veteran players will probably enjoy it more than newcomers. I find myself shying away from building a deck from scratch but will probably craft one of the patterned decks (card lists given by the game after defeating campaign duels).There are still hiccups in-game when trying to activate certain abilities in the right order to set-up chains. One major, major flaw in the design (or lack thereof) is the inability to turn off the pop-ups asking if you'd like to activate a trap. For example, if I have a trap laid that will grant life for each card in play, the game will ask me at every single phase of a turn (so 6 or 7 times) if I'd like to activate the ability. The only work-around to this is to hold down the right mouse button, but even so it's extremely annoying and in need of another option.Other than this flaw, gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. The AI is somewhat predictable at times but can still be challenging. I found some matches relied heavily on which cards were drawn and not so much skill, but that's reality sometimes. I've also had a couple matches where I feel like the AI could have done more against me and didn't.Also, concerning the DLC - it's not required and all cards can be purchased within the game with in-game currency.Overall I've enjoyed playing so far and can see myself playing this one for a while."

No idea why it took them this long to create a PC game similar to that and I'm glad that this excels Yu-Gi-Oh online in every way. Don't need to purchase more cards or any bs.

I have concluded the game does indeed crash performing certain card effects, my game personally crashs about 25% of the time with Joeys Red-Eyes deck. With the crashing aside i have to recommend this game. There are a lot of functional cards with only few to have bugs and plenty of challenges to keep you busy. I have already built an Exodia deck that wins in 5 or less turns without fighting and im still working on it! The game is definitely worth a buy and i personally recommend Yugis Aroma deck if you're aiming for DLC.Multiplayer is definitely a barren wasteland. I'll see maybe 2 lobbys to join every so often, but they never start the game. If you make one of your own its gonna take quite some time before anyone joins it. So hopefully multiplayer will kick up better when more people get the game.All in all. This is the best Yugioh game you can get for PC at the moment and i highly recommend it."

It's something we've tested out and confirmed it to be true.Another thing I'm having troubles with is once in a while my game just... crashes. It's only happened twice but both times was when a card effect was going off. I'm now running it in compatibility mode to see if that helps it at all.Other than that, I have no complaints. It's nice to be able to play Yugioh with my friends without having to pump hundreds of dollars into the game.There is one thing my friends and I were wondering (though it might just be we haven't found the settings) and it's if there's any way there could be an optoinal mode for online play that doesn't have the card restrictions, as in basically what is allowed in the Campaign mode (nothing crazy like ""can I have six BEWD in my deck?""), just having a non regulation ruled game with friends would be fun, cause then we could show off our decks that we use in the campaign without having to modify them.Lastly, thank you very much for the lovely game."

Having grown up with games like ""Yugioh Forbidden Memories"" and ""Yugioh Power of Chaos"" which were incredibly limited in their gameplay and emulation of the actual card game, Legacy ofthe Duelist is the type of game I WISH I had as a kid. You get to play through the story of the anime with the decks from the show. You get to follow the actual rules of the game during those duels. You can build decks of your own to face characters from the show. I haven't even touched multiplayer in this game but the single player campaign is plenty worth the purchase price. My only complaint is that the duels can get a little bogged down by the prompts especially if you set trap cards that can be activated at any time. I much prefer the format of ""Magic Duels"" where there's a timer that you can activate if you want to use a card that interrupts.

The base package is incredibly expansive, unlike some older Yu-Gi-Oh! titles, example Power of Chaos - Yugi The Destiny, which had somewhere around 190 total cards if memory serves me right. This title has thousands, just how many I don't know. They can all be acquired ingame by either beating duels (earning signature cards directly, depending on who you face) or by spending points in the shop to buy card packs. You get a nice chunk of points per duel, usually 800-1000 if you lose and 1500-2000 if you win. Packs are either 200 or 400 points a piece, with 8 cards in each. Very easy to earn yourself new cards, and there are no microtransactions. The only other purchase you may consider besides the base game would be one of the DLCs, but more on that below.The campaigns are interesting and let you play through duels from the shows, Yu-Gi-Oh, GX, 5DS, ZEXAL and ARC-V. Not all of them, but enough to follow the story if you haven't seen them. Note that I have only seen the original show, so I can only speak for that one, but the others have enough text between duels to get the point across.All in all; for 19,99 this is absolutely fantastic. Actually, it's fantastic without the cheap price but it helps make it even better.

,Not Recommended,480650,32465420,Posted: 15 June,all,Beeps,"If you're out of the loop when it comes to Yugioh and you want to experience all the different deck types in the hands of an AI, this is a very solid grab for it's value, and I would reccomend it. My main problems with this game, and the reasons why I am giving it a thumbs down, are that the game has almost zero value once youdofigure out how to play, and that the game is a tremendously unpolished product with several borderline unacceptable problems. If you have even the slightest idea of how to play modern Yugioh, this game has absolutely no value to you. You can play either bots or humans on YGOPro with any cards you want, without paying a penny.Let me start out with a disclaimer that none of this review has anything to do with the actual card game of Yugioh. It is what it is, that has nothing to do with Legacy of the Duelist's value. I will give one warning for those who have never played the game or those who have only ever played in extremely casual formats--Yugioh isbusted as hell. There are so many ways to get a completely non-interactive win it's unbelivable. And this is *not* just the top tier meta decks, this is literally any deck you could make with any success rate. Since the turn times in Legacy are so long, I would frequently play a little game where I'd alt-tab out of the game whenever the AI opponent has no cards on their sides of the field and I have a huge lifepoint advantage. I'm expecting to be inexplicably wiped and shown the loss screen when I come back. You would not believe the amount of times this has happened. I would venture to say more than 50 games.But it is what it is, a product in service to the fans. Unfortunately, pretty much every aspect of the game makes it impossible for me to reccomend the game to those fans. To begin with, the gameoozescheapness and rushed results. Every single aspect of the game looks like it was implemented with absolutely no effort, from the laughably short and sparse storyline dialogue, to the animations. Even the menuing looks incredibly awful--something as basic as the details of a card are shown with a tacky white font against a black background, forcing you away from the board. You can also look at the effects of a card by putting your mouse over it, but it's shoved in such a tiny text box that it takes forever to scroll through. The worst part of the menuing is the deck building interface, where it becomes plainly obvious that this game was a rushed console port. Not only can you only figure out basic functions like changing your avatar or your deck name by going to the options menu and figuring out the keybinds, but somehow even the font seems to have undergone a resolution downgrade--it looks much better on PS4. Probably the worst part of the deck building interface is that something as basic as searching for a card is hidden behind three different mouse clicks on a filter tab that can barely be seen at the bottom left of the screen.Then there's the duels themselves. To begin with, reaction-based interactions such as quick effects, trap cards and monster effects are all activated by either mashing the hell out of the left mouse button on a card, or an optional prompt that pops up when an effect could *ever* be triggered. There are three different settings for this prompt: you can turn it off completely, you can set it to 'automated' where the game pulls up the prompt whenever it thinks playing a card is a good idea, or you can set it to *always* be active, inbetween every single phase that ever occurs in the game. The automated system works well for me and I have no problems with it, but the total uselessness of the other settings fails to provide any customization whatsoever for a fundamental part of playing the game.There's really no customizationat all. Notably, certain popularized cards like Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon have incredibly lame (PS1 quality) and obnoxious animations whenever they attack another card. There is no option to turn this animation off, period, so if you play cards like Blue Eyes or Utopia, get ready for your duels to become interrupted by amateur light shows. The worst part is that not only are these animations incredibly bad and unskippable, but they didn't even bother to animate more than 10 or so cards. Dark Magician Girl has an animation despite almost never being used, but they couldn't even bother to animate staples like Black Luster Soldier or Cyber End Dragon.The constant interruptions are a big part of my biggest problem with the game, and the main reason behind writing this review: this game isso ♥♥♥♥ing slow. It's unreal. To begin with, every single duel begins with a 10 second load screen that opens up to a Rock Paper Scissors prompt, which takes another 10 seconds or so. Then you get to the actual duel and regardless of who's turn it is, the delay is monsterous. It takes about 4 seconds to do something as basic as setting a card down or normal summoning a blank monster. The card effects double this time, and that's if they don't prompt another summon or shuffle the deck. Why the ♥♥♥♥ is there a 5 second animation for shuffling the deck? Do we really need something this drawn out for something that barely effects the opponent? Among the worst is the effect of ""excavation"" cards, which are cards that force one duelist to draw cards and show them to the opponent. Pot of Duality lets you exacavate three cards and add one to your deck and the amount of time this takes is, I swear to god, 16 seconds. The worst part is you don't even really get a good look at their cards when this hapens, it just slowly flips them upwards and you say ""I kind of recognize that card. What does that do again?"" 'Complex' summoning mechanics like Fusion, Synchro or XYZ summoning have it the worst. You fuse your monsters together and the animation takes like 10 whole seconds. These are mechanics that will be occuring nearly every single turn in duelist challenges. And do you know howlongYugioh turns take? I've seen four-minute turns in YGOPro, a system which is nearly five times as fast as Legacy.The worst offender of them all is chain effects. For those who don't know, a chain is when you activate multiple cards in response to one another. Here's how it should be done: Let's say I play Call of the Haunted, you play Mystical Space Tyhpoon to destroy it, then I play Curse of Royals to negate your effect. The cards flash by: Call of the Haunted, MST, Royals. Done. Here's how Legacy does it. Call of the Haunted gets played, it flashes by. MST gets played, it flashes by. An awful looking ""CHAIN"" graphic appears on the screen. It shows CotH AGAIN, then MST. Then Royals gets played, and it does the whole ♥♥♥♥ing thing again: CHAIN, then CotH, then MST, then Royals. This would continue on forever if there were even more negates in play. You have to watch the animationeach time a card is playedin the chain. It is unbelievably dumb.""But Beepo, it has to be this way or else new people wouldn't be able to follow the game"". No it doesn't, because I've played for 83 hours against virtually every archetype and I still have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what is going on half the time. As I said before, it doesn't display what excavated cards do, nor does it even do something as basic as display what quick play cards do, although that can usually be inferred. A huge source of annoyance for me is that not only is the display text for cards incredibly small, but it automatically jumps from the card you're reading to the card that's most recently being used. This means that an effect monster can come onto the field, special summon with an effect, and then before you even read what the heck just happened, your text is immediately repositioned to the new card, and you cannot go back until the end of the turn.Oh, and you can't surrender when it's the opponent's turn. What the hell is that? No card game does that."

Controls arent very good especially on deck building.It is not overpriced, but there shouldn't be any DLC' s.Unlocking cards should have been better, we should get some kind of compensation when we receive a card we already have 3 copies of. In other series like Tag Force, we could exchange our extra copies (3+) for some other random card.The online gaming is terrible- extremely laggy, and a lot of leaving here and there.Attack animation of some popular monsters get really boring after seeing the same pixellous animation over and over- we can't skip them.Overall, the game is fun if you just play for the story, i enjoyed the gx and original series storylines, but i quit the game afterwards.For online gaming, definitely go for YGOPRO or something like that."

,Recommended,480650,28300433,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,KabalXFS,"So, a YGO oficial game on steam... Freaking finally!Pros:- booster packs (because having all the cards from the start is boring);- a campaign with (most of) the story of the anime and single player challanges;- (most of) recent cards and (mostly) updated banlist;- doesn't require anything special, you can play on a toaster and DLC's are optional, you can win with what the vanilla game gives you;- a freaking YGO oficial game on steam!- pretty simple (as expected from a card game);Cons:- the animation can be quite slow at times (e.g. prompts to activate quick stuff or nuke effects), even the ancient Power of Chaos games seemed quite faster;- no clue whatsoever to what pack contains what, you can guess or google it, but there are plenty of random crud (e.g. Bakura has Agents and Syrus has Darklords);- the robot narrator becames quite dull real quick, I'd wish they'd gave us some options (nothing's stopping you from skipping everything, but, well, I don't want to);- you want more cards and/or support? There is a ton of DLC, maybe wait for a sale or something;- mediocre (at best!) support for my favorite archtype: Darklords;- missing some pop/new whole archtypes and some vital new support for old school stuff (can be bypassed with creativity);- unskippable tutorials, for veterans this is really boring;My advice? If you like YGO, buy it, this is what we (I, at least) were waiting for. If you like card games in general, give it a chance, it's pretty good once you get the hang of it. Overall this is a great game, for fans and new players alike, and, in general, any pro outweights every con, since they're mostly annoyance that you either get used to or learn to live with (except the DLC thingy, that is bad business)."

,Not Recommended,480650,29776566,Posted: 7 February,all,Raptor Jesus,"Being a Yu-Gi-Oh veteran (started in 2002), I wanted so badly for there to be a PC yugioh game that wasn't power of chaos or whatever those ancient games were, it felt right to me. I loved Dueling Network before NAS took it down, solely because of the fact that it was what everybody would have wanted, a dueling simulator that lets people who still play the game play together regardless of location. However, and I really hate to say this, this game is a major disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, here is what I think about the game. Please note that the pros and cons could be exactly the same but there's good reason behind it.Pros:+Online dueling!+No microtransactions! You earn the currency to buy cards.+Replay value, you can do reverse duels in the campaigns to earn cards, or to see what it's like to see the bad guys winning+You can use either story decks or your own decks in the campaign.Cons:-A lackluster campaign, it cuts out the relatively important duels.-DLC, and a lot of it. They're opting to just release DLCs instead of updating the game to give us more updated sets. Want the complete experience? That'll be $105 total. You also pay around $50 to be able to play any of Arc-V's campaign, they only have the tutorial.-Long tutorials in the guise of the pilot duels from each series.-Online dueling is nice, but they took down Dueling Network and YGOPro to release this, when both of those systems are better than this game in its current state.-Clearly a port, and a lazy one at that. They added keyboard prompts which is nice, but the code itself is messed up. Attack with more than 10,000 attack directly, the game crashes, or specific cards don't activate as intended, and there's clearly no hope for a patch, it's been about 2 months since the game's release, and only one patch came out that didn't really resolve any of the issues that's been talked about in the forums.-No changes whatsoever to the game, not even graphical changes, the monsters look really lazy in the animation department.-The game won't even run for some people who have DirectX 11 or 12 capable graphics cards and it gives you an error saying that you need direct3d level 10 or higher to play it, you have to hack the game just to be able to play it on some modern PCsIf you release a game with an online component you need to have some communication with your community. This is clearly abandonware and it bugs me that they took down programs and sites that actually had an amazing community (minus the toxicity that every community has) and the fact that they didn't fix any issues that the game clearly has is also bugging me and a lot of people in the online community. And a lack of anti-cheat system is a really bad idea in the long run.Rating: 5/10"

Customizable avatars and script? Not to mention games like Duelists of the Roses and Capsule Monster Colisuem?) this is still a good game. It has a ton of cards and characters, so whichever generation of cards is your favorite, you can use at your disposal. Is it enjoyable all the time? No.Because it's glitchy as crap. It'll go through phases of a magical disappearing mouse cursor that only shows up when you move it. That's tolerable, but sometimes the game won't let you activate response cards, like traps when your opponent is attacking, chain effects, or even monster effects like Injection Fairy Lily. And it'll crash randomly! And now today, no matter how many times I open the game, I will start a duel and it will continuously scroll through my hand without me moving a muscle, which makes it difficult to click on anything! Is this game ever going to work correctly? It needs to be patched yesterday!It's not unplayable, but it makes trying to play very frustrating! And it's not evident right away, either. The only reason I would not recommend this game is because of all the glitches. It's a decent game otherwise. Hopefully this gets fixed."

The cards you get have no value since the game was abandoned by Konami, and multiplayer is nearly dead.Online your opponent will ALWAYS disconnect when you're winning, so you have no way of getting the achievement for winning a ranked match. And Konami will never fix it.It also have a few crippling glitches (game crashing when you deal > 10k damage for example).No 2017 sets. Don't even bother trying to playtest on this dinosaur. The banlist is outdated. And you can't even use this to play old metas since both players cannot use forbidden cards at the same time, even in friends duel.

As my time playing implies I played Yu-Gi-Oh! when it was a lot simpler of a game and deck complexity was much easier to handle and that's how I liked it. You can still play singleplayer with relatively simple decks that reflect that simpler time and if you're good enough you can even beat the singleplayer duelist challenge AI's who use the new much more complex decks with a relatively old-school deck.But here's where the game gets bad if you play it old-school like me:Due to the random nature of draws and a good hand being the factor for a win or lose in any game the ranked mode is inherently flawed, your rank will constantly flucuate due to factors you more or less can't control. So in ranked mode rank is pretty much non-existant and you can be fighting a noob 1 match then the next get a basement dweller neckbeard god duelist.>inb4 ""git gud""Conclusion: If you play Yu-Gi-Oh!

The story is fun to play, but the story decks are so one sided. Even if the character you are playing as wins in the show they will either make it extremely easy for you to stomp the enemy or they make it hard for you to even win. The way buying cards that is being done is not great. I wish they followed the way the other games, allowing you to buy multiple packs in 1 go. Playing in windowed mode sometimes crashing when I am looking at another window because the enemy takes like a 15 step turn. Overall this game is not that bad. It is fun and enjoyable"

,Recommended,480650,28609576,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,Phoenix,"This is a kinda lazy console port.  Thankfully, the base game is good enough and the hardware requirements are so low that it doesn't really matter.To summarize some of the things that makes it stand out from the other recent yugioh games, like Millenium duels on Xbox 360 and PS3, this game has 230 campaign duels, with story decks and challenge duels. The campaign goes through all the important duels of each series, Yugioh, Yugioh GX, Yugioh 5ds, Yugioh Zexal, Yugioh Arc V and you can choose to play with either the deck of the person you play as (usually the main character) or your own deck.  The decks in campaign replicate the deck used in the show as close as possible (even going as far as to use banned cards like monster reborn), while the decks in challenge mode are meant to be as competitive as possible while still having the general theme of the character's deck.  In the campaign mode, you can actually use banned cards if you want, but banned cards are banned in multiplayer.DLC is good, but overpriced.  Get it if you are desperate for more content (despite 230 duels in base game) and have the money, but otherwise, ignore it. There are 6838 cards obtainable in game w/o dlc, 7481 with dlc.  There may be some cards you want to get the DLC for, but it's not necessary to get all of them."

76561198047915166,Recommended,480650,29676034,Posted: 3 February,all,Netatsake,"Very reminiscent of Dueling Network, both in its board and its deck constructor. Excellent card variety, though still missing quite a lot of cards (though I have yet to do anything with the DLCs, so I can't say exactly how many cards it's missing in entirety. Nor do I have all the cards in the game. Shoot me.) The game itself is... well... yugioh. If you're familiar with it, then there's not much to say. It's yugioh. A few minor complaints on my end, but if you can deal with them, then you've got a relatively decent (officially licensed!) yugioh game, which is more than I can say for 90% of the ones out there.-Certain monsters have battle animations that can't be skipped. You'll see this most likely in your first or second story match when blue-eyes or dark magician decimates something. They get a little annoying but I haven't found too many cards that I personally use that have them. Blue-eyes, red-eyes and dark magician have been the only ones I've seen. If they're the only ones then I can deal with that since I don't like the decks that use any of those three and the decks I play counter them pretty hard anyways.-Deck constructor's search function. It's not very easily visible, but while it's more in-depth than Dueling Network's was, it's incredibly frustrating to use no matter whether you use controller or keyboard and mouse. This is one of the areas where the game is most evident in being a crappy console port.-Card packs and their card randomization. I've gotten card packs that have had more than the usable 3 copies of a specific card in them. I've seen packs that gave me absolutely nothing new, not only no new cards, but excess copies of cards. The game only counts up to 3 of each card in your deck constructor. I understand it's trying to keep booster pack realism but I don't like that I don't get at least one new card each pack, or don't get refunded on cards that are in excess.-Trap card/quickplay spell notifications. This can be disabled and/or minimized, but by changing the notification type on activations from 'simple' or 'default' to 'pro,' which removes them altogether, it makes you hold a button/key in order to activate a card at a time when it would be viable. It's a little tedious and I don't understand it too well honestly. However, holding whatever's your cancel input (right click/B button default) allows you to skip the prompts completely, so there you go. Just keep an eye out so you don't forget to activate a card when you actually need it.-Phase changing. The phase changing menu is pretty simple, but I've had a few mishaps where I've tried to attack with a monster when it wasn't the battle phase and had my monster switch to defense, which has cost me duels already. You really have to pay attention to what you're selecting in menus. It can be quite annoying if you don't. There are also some card effects that're taken entirely too literally in the game. For example, with Spellbinding Circle - if the monster it's affecting gets tributed, the circle remains on the field doing nothing. Similar issue with Mystical Space Typhoon and destroying activated spells without negating the effect. The card itself doesn't actually state that it negates effects, but so far as I'm aware, it has always been treated as negating them since it's used standard in nearly every single deck in existence. But if you try to use it on a Dark Hole when it's activated, you'll be wasting the thing. It gets pretty annoying actually."

This is pretty much a godsend for me because I honestly didn't know anything about the game past the 2010 ruleset and cards.One of the few things I'm kind of annoyed about is that there are no tag duels. That being said, from what I've experienced, that's not neccesarily a negative thing. The ai in all of the DS games (the ones that I've owned at least) is horrendous and they do things you would'nt even expect, like having a deck based around equip spell cards, and not placing a single one down even though their hand is full of them. This is starting to feel more like a review for Reverse of Arcadia now instead of LotD.This is a good game, let's stick w/ that. If you enjoy the duel monsters game, or if you are looking for a new card game that is infamous for it's overlycomplicated rules, then this game could be for you. Just don't go hoping to duel real people unless you can get a friend w/ this game to play w/ you. The multiplayer is a barren wasteland, every once in a while one or two people will show up, but that's kinda rare. Also, there are no real servers, it's more of a lobby.Decent ghem. 6.3/10"

It will make simple errors that lose it the game all the time, like forgetting that fusion decks exist. Some of the story decks are very well built, and actually cleverly reflect the feel from the old shows, but most of them are just bad, with a few monsters made prominent for no reason other than they were used for an episode and suddenly you have a deck filled with three coies of Swordsman of Landstar. For reasons unknown, you can't check the field when you add a card to your hand. Well, you can, but you can'tcheck the fusion deck or graveyard, which is what you want to do half the time anyway.Other than that, it's pretty much exactly the same as the last Yugioh game that came out for pc, so use your discretion.

,Recommended,480650,31839851,Posted: 19 May,all,[[-|-409th-|-]] Deon,"I'm an old school yugioh fan, and I feel if anyone should be writing a review, it should be me. Now right off the bat, I'm going to tell you, this game has flaws. Some of those flaws come from the fact of a past yugioh game not having them, or from the yugioh card game itself. .Comparison to past yugioh titles:yugioh is not a franchise that has had many well known games, and its video game pressence is an obscure one at best, lets be real here.........I mean.........most of us loved the show, but how many of us honestly looked at a yugioh game, sitting next to call of duty, and mom puffs her cigerrete and says ""alright ya little failed abortion, you can pick one game"" and then you choose yugioh ? Well your in luck.......I happen to be one of the weird ones who chose those over call of duty, and let me tell you......yugioh games have been all over the place as far as quality is concerned. I've played this old spin off for the PS2 called ""capsule monsters"" I've played the tag force games for PSP and PS2 (GX series) and I've played this small DLC game on the PS3. Out of these, Tag force was easily the best. Great card selection, had a free roam (though it was limited) and it was highly replayable. And thats for both the PSP and PS2 versions of it. And how does legacy of the duelist stack up to these 2 games? It simply doesnt, from a story standpoint. Even with its limited free roam, it made those games infinitely more engaging, and made you feel apart of the yugioh universe.............something that every other yugioh game failed to capatalize on, and so does legacy. So I am disappointed in this game for not making an attempt at what the tag force games did, instead, opting to copy the actual shows word for word, which, yeah, it kinda tailors to my nostalgia..........but time, and increased maturity has made me realize that my childhood is best kept where it belongs........I'd prefer another yugioh game like tag force, which actually attempts to bring you into thier universe, rather then see it from the eyes of existing characters. For this, I am disappointed in legacy.However, legacy does give you the largest card selection of any yugioh game to date........its arsenal of cards is truly impressive, and I remamber my only problem with tag force being, that the cards were only up to date to about 2007. Back then, there were far less cards, and only classic series and GX series were available. Now we have 3 more series, each bringing a massive array of cards. From the standpoint of someone who truly likes the card game, this game is an absolute gold mine. I was looking for more then just the card game, but even i cant deny, that I do love the card game enough to really love the huge potential this game offers for that aspect. And it truly does not disappoint in that regard.Problems with the Yugioh card game itselfThis problem, is naturally inherent to almost every yugioh game however. This isnt the fault of the game developers, but its the fault of the people who ran the anime series and made the cards..........and I might trigger some of you by what I say here too.Yugioh card game is more luck based then skill based. I dare you to argue with me on this, but it is........once your in battle, your chance of victory hinges on a lot of factors that are somewhat out of your control. Skillful play can mitigate these factors, but its easy to use your hand effectively, most people can do that. Really, the real skill behind this card game, is deck building. If you are someone who is able to make the most fluid and cohesive decks, then you put yourself way ahead of most, and that is where the real skill element of the game lies at. Building the deck is what matters most, playing is simple by comparison but can still change the outcome of battles too.Another major problem with the card game.........is that each series basically supercedes the last one. What I mean by this is, classic series decks cannot stand up to most GX decks, GX decks struggle against 5Ds series decks, and so on and so forth. I stopped with yugioh at some point after GX series ended, as that is when they introduced new mechanics, such as tuners and synchro summons. GX was the last series that played more or less the same as classic yugioh. What this basically means, is that the most competitive decks are likely to be in the latest series. And since I'm old school, I dont quite understand how most of these new dueling mechanics work either. I remember taking my classical based deck online against someone who was deeply rooted in these new systems and mechanics........and it was utterly ridiculous how powerless I was during the entire match. I was using a deck from classical that would have been considered top tier in that era too. I see this as a major balancing issue in the card game itself, and its not the fault of the game developers, but mainly the fault of those who ran the anime and TCG.Also..........I have wanted to bang Mae Valentine since I was a very young kid watching the anime, I swear she was my first crush in anime.All and all, I'm telling you this is a good game, worth 20 dollars if you are a fan of yugioh, or someone looking to become a fan.......but I want everyone to know the missed opportunity this game failed to capture. It would go from just a good game, to a AMAZEBALLS game that could revitalize the aging yugioh community for at least one last time..........and then we could all have loads of fun off this classic childhood favorite of mine.Now shut up and check out these funny quotes:Its time to D-D-D-D-D-D-D-DUEL - Yami YugiScrew the rules, I have money !!! - Seto KaibaAh man, you're actually going to class?

But for right now I'd recommend waiting for a patch or fix to come out.  Seems right now after getting the Yu-Gi-Oh! Waken the Dragons: Joey's Journey DLC when I play the reverse duel between Joey and Valon the game crashes several times while I try to play.  It usually crashes on me once or twice a day. That particular duel though crashes almost every time. There  are bugs in this game that need to be worked out.  Otherwise the game has been quite fun when it works properly.

However, the first duel of each campaign will teach you the mechanics of that generation. You can buy cards, or booster packs, with in-game currency, of which you recieve from winning duels and even from surrendering.However, there is a grind for the monies.

You have the option of using your own deck for campaign duels or using a story deck but regardless of what you pick the computer is going to have an OTK combo deck no matter what. Honestly the campaign should be a fun refresher to the game and allowing you to be the hero in the ""historic"" duels that they provide. Instead they make the campaign be exactly what you would face online while screwing you in your draws. I have literally drawn the spell that I needed at turn 1 when I only had a couple hundred or so life points left and it wouldn't matter. There are better online dueling simulators out there that are free and provide a much better experience and you won't need to waste any money for them.

76561197977356224,Recommended,480650,30788807,Posted: 28 March,all,chronos,"Hello and good morning everyone,I am a young man 26 years old and I start playing Yu-gi-oh when I was 11 years old.The first video game I played from Yu-gi-oh was World championship 2002.Was a 32 bit game on the Gameboy advance.  And it was pretty smooth for that time, including if I remember well  more than 1000 card maybe less.  Synchro and Xyz wasn't invented yet. And not to forgot the Kaiba A.I :) it knew how to use a OTK deck and killed you in turn 2 or turn 3 with it ultimate blue eyes white dragon+ cyberstein(pay 5000LP summon a fusion from your side deck) and then gived it mega morph and finished you with 9000 dmg... mercy less Kaiba boy. Pegasus was kinder .  After Each duel you could chose one pack of cards and if you had one box complete. you had all the boosters, you had all the cards!Later it was a game for the Nintendo DS Nightmare troubadoure.Very cool. Had nice 3D graphics for that time and was fast for what it offered you, plus the key settings and the controls were intuitive. The A.I was good but and knew how to play there decks. it had also those nice duel-quiz. where you learned some nice combo and it expanded your way of thinking in therms of winning chance. Is it already over? In manga yugi would call it ; the hearth of the cards :)And after each duel ,you earned some DP and you could use them to buy boosters. Each Display contained a fixed amount of boosters, but all cards were in there. You couldn't have cards more than trice. So , the fun of open Packs was there and a mindless grinding did not happend because you used the new cards everytime and build new decks because there were new cards after every booster opening.Well and now 10 years later , I bought on steam Legacy of the Duelist.I am amazed how much cards exists now and how the A.I use it's decks maximum potention!The campaign is very good for players like me who did a longer pause. You play the stories from the Anime/Manga from Duelist kingdom to ARC-V .So  you face every new type of style. from early Exodia decks and dragons beatdown, black magician spell combo to synchro and -xyz monsters. and later in ARC V what Pendelum cards are.the duel challenges are very cool, every npc has it signature deck and is a bit diffrent from the deck they use in the campaign. for exemple . the dude who had Slifer the god card and played it against yugi in the kaiba cup uses in the duel challenge a very power full Token deck XD very cool.Some card have their restriction but that counts only for online batlle. but even if so . you will learn that 3 Raigeki or other forbidden cards are not often the solution for the duel .  Pegasus with his magidolce deck was hard to beat but the last encounter from yugioh GX was easy peasy because of one trap card which burned the whole deck.So i like the game for it's variosity and the ammount of cards you can get.But the speed of the game and how to grind cards are not fun.And some animations are not well designed.For exemple , cyberjar : after it's flip effect when is activated, destroy all monsters on the field and every player draw 5 new cards. every card is showed to the other player one by one.Every monster between 1 and 4 Level is special summon in face up or face down position.  the whole animation take too long because every card is drawn single and shown  again after the monster the is summoned. and then the setting starts.the set up is done and now the other player can do the whole thing again.  A very time consuming process.Time could be gained by making the draw of the card one action. means. you draw the five cards at once.the cards should be shown as the side deck is shown when you take a detail view of the side deck.both players give their okay or after 20 second next cycle of the effects starts. choosing starts how you want to play the monster cards. the other player do the same thing. the remaining cards are added to the hand.Is the effect done:players should be asking if they want to use effects of traps,monsters,speed-spells.Are no effects activated  the chain-cycle should do its thing.the chain is complete ,the battle should be at it's normal moment where the attacking player can attack if the effect was activitated in the battlephase.Same goes for the animation of ""digging"" cards from you deck.That is just one exemple how to speed up the game i think by 40% in that scenario.If you like yu gi oh or want to learn the game: this is the best game in terms of possibilities, but not the fastest one ;)I give it 8/10 points. there is room for improvement. Maybe the publisher could send some of their senior programmers to the design studio and help them a bit.An improvement of gameplay will for sure :1 , rise the gamespeed,2: a simple logic boost the system3:  rules would not be disrespected4: a better gameplay-> more gametime->more players-> and now very intressting for company ; more sells5: a win-win-win situation.peace :)"

The matchups in the campaign are weighed so bad, like yugi barely scrapes victories in the anime so expect to do the harder duels several times. And the port is god aweful, play this with a controller if you are going to buy it. While its neccisary, the pop ups during every step of a phase when you can activate a trap/quick play spell, are the most annoying things ever. The game just lacks flow imo.Also, it could have been so much better with the story element. Since the whole thing is based on events in the anime some sort of voice acting would have made this a much more immersive expereience.If you're planning to use this as a similar too to yugioh pro, dont. Building and testing decks just wont work as well on this.However, if you wanna take a trip down nostalgia lane. Buy it. Its pretty fun playing through iconic duels.While theres a lot of bad points, it is a really fun game, and its cool to use cards you may not use in the TCG aswell."

For nothing more than the nostalgia of it all it is worth the price point set on the game. Having thoroughly gone through multiple aspects that are currently available I can definetely state there are improvements that can and should be made. First in my book would be the option for tag/team duels which were consistently shown in the tv series, as per mechanics I would also add an ability to customize card prompts in game as it gets highly annoying when your dust tornado or similar quick acting cards prompt on every single phase of yours and your oponnents turn. The ability to use forbidden/limited decks without restriction in multiplayer would be nice as well, all that would have to happen is a second que listed stating that you will be qued against other decks without restrictions besides card number count, this feature has thus far been missing in most yugioh games and imo realy set this one apart. My last complaint is the lack of content found in the dlcs while i understand they are extra content the price of 4.99 per dlc with a measley 2 prebuilt deck and 2-3 extra duels in game that ive seen so far makes it seem like a severe rip off especially since their asking for 1/4 the cost of the full game, if i had to price it out i would put the dlc worth around $0.50 per which still provides profit for the game while not gouging the pockets of supporters. All that said though I would still very highly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys card games, very well thought out tutorials spaced out in a way that isnt overwhelming to newbie and veteran alike and hours of fun content for 19.99 this is a steal! =)"

There is no voice acting, you just read what's on the screen, and if you're not familiar with the show or characters then the story is even less meaningful, as it skips over lots of details and throws in random characters to duel you from out of nowhere. Contrast this with ""Yugioh tag force GX"", which lets you walk around and feel the progression, and where duels  arrise naturally instead of just one after the other like a machine gun. But like I said, for 20 euro it's not too bad at all.Good Stuff:The best thing this game does is that it divides up the different generations of yugioh from duelist kingdom, to 5ds/ARK V , etc. So if you would just like to play oldschool style you can do that. Or if you are new altogether it is really good for you. The campaign is nice in that before every game it lets you choose between XYZ deck, story deck, your own personal deck, synchro deck and a few others, even in Duellist Kingdom.Another good thing is that I, who have never played past the GX era, found it really easy to understand the XYZ and Synchro stuff. These new complications killed yugioh for me but having tried out a couple of the premade decks I am starting to kind of like them.Some stuff:- The music sucks. It sucks big time. Mute it and play some other music.- You don't have access to all cards like in Yugioh Pro. You need to buy them in boosters with in game money.- It does animations with story cards like Blue eyes, Darkmagician etc.. Boring, and they are tier 1 garbage animations.- PROTIP: Hold Esc or right click to stop it asking you if you want to activate your quick play card/trap card etc. Shiit's annoying."

I can't find a single player to duel with online. Is it because this game is kind of new so it lacks the player base? I've literally waited 15 minutes and no one joined the lobby to duel with.
,Recommended,480650,28845995,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Officer McDouble,I've been playing this game for 3hrs straight and I can't stop loving it. So far i'm only going through the original Yu-Gi-Oh! campaign and it's a trip down memory lane with every duel. There are thousands upon thousands of cards and you're like a giddy school girl all over again when you're opening a new pack to see what you get.The game plays just like you see in the show. The card looks just like the originals.I reccomend this game for anyone who was a fan of any series. For $20 you're vound to get hours upon hours from each individual campaign. Well worth your money.

I have been playing the card game ever since I was a little kid. I have playing my fair share of Yugioh video games and barely any I would consider to be any good. In fact, the last good Yugioh series of games that I have played is the Tag-Force series. I guess the DS ones are really well done as well, but I haven't really played those.Anyway, I would honestly consider this game to be good. It has a lot of content involved and the fact that you can play through the story decks of the Yugioh series is a really nice change of pace from the other Yugioh games. I am pretty sure other reviews have told you this, however I am going to tell you this as well: Most of the time I really hate using the story decks, because it feels impossable at times to complete the duel. Also, I really... really can't stand the RNG BS. When I used to play Yugioh, I mixed my deck up really nice and I always got a good hand. However, with this game I counted several times where I got a bad hand and I couldn't recovery, where as the computer player got a perfect hand and was able to pull off a lot of crazy stuff. Though when you finally beat that duel that gave you a hard as heck time, you really feel a sense of accomplishment.I really love making my own deck in this game. In most Yugioh games, you have to do what the banlist tells you too if I remember correctly. In this game however, you can add whatever you want to your deck. For reference, in most Yugioh games you can only add one Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning to your deck in the card game, according to the banlist. In this game, you can add three of them to your deck if you want. This amount of freedom is something that I never had while playing the actual card game and it made me have fun with it all over again.I will end my review by saying this: I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really hate the whole microtransactions crap. The total amount of the DLC is about $95 dollars. Check yourself if you don't believe me!Each pack costs around 5.50, however in my honest opinion the content that you get is only worth 2.30. At least in the packs that I bought. Honestly though, you don't really need to buy the any of the DLC. There is enough content in this game, to where it feels like a full $21 dollar game. You basically get what you ask for, assuming that you don't buy the DLC.Do I recommend buy the DLC with the game? Honestly, no. True that you get more duels with the product, however, in my opinion, with the content that is in the DLC that I bought, it isn't worth it for me. If you want to get the DLC, that is fine. I won't hold it against you if you decide to get any of the DLC.That is really all I have to say. Hope you liked this. Laters!EDIT (Janurary. 18th, 2017): I feel as though I should mention one thing: I am not sure if it is because of my computer or if it is the game itself, however I notice how the game crashes a lot. It could be just my computer, but I feel like I should mention it anyway."

Lots of duels to be played there.Multiplayer is terrible: barely any players, ranked mode might as well not exist (feels no different from playing casual), many hosts seem ""frozen"" and stay hosted for hours, and you either win or get beaten by a distance since the skill disparity in this game is, more often than not, gigantic.Deckbuilding is okay once you get used to it. It's daunting at first because the controls are anything but intuitive because...It's a badly done port. The controls do work but are infuriating if you intend to play with the mouse only.Grinding for cards is a huge pain unless you know your way around Cheat Engine, and even then it's bad (with infinite money for packs and a speedhack to open packs 10x faster). There is no way to get a specific card via something like crafting. Instead, you have to get lucky with packs or duel a NPC with that card in their deck (a random card from their deck drops after the duel). Very few cards are locked behind DLCs, though.Altogether it's recommendable, especially if you're a newer player or haven't played YGO in years. This is nothing for the veterans who are used to YgoPro/DevPro, and this is not even close to being the new YGO Online."

Online multiplayer is really bad, takes 10 minutes to find an opponent, and it doesn't search automatically until it finds a match.  You must continually search manually for 10 minutes as it tells you ""no matches found"" each 10 seconds.Otherwise, now the show makes sense, campaign = THERE ARE NO RULES!You can construct decks without restrictions for campaign, but multiplayer forces you to use a restricted deck.  I think that should be an option if you want to play locally with a friend with no deck restrictions.After playing this game for over 24 hours, I can honestly say 20$ was worth it for me as an avid Yu-Gi-Oh! fan.

If you want to play Yu-Gi-Oh on steam this is your chance.Single PlayerThe campain is huge, and the card pool is also huge. The deck builder is streamlined for both keyboard and controller. I have played a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh games through my days and I can say that the single player is probably just about the best camapain out of all of the ones I have played. You go through every season of Yu-Gi-Oh and play with the story deck from both sides. Also you can use your own user made deck for any duel in the campain. The game is genrous with the currency so you will constantly be able to buy new cards.TLDR;Single Player is huge, and well made. Everything you want.MultiplayerThis is where the game takes a drop. The online community is pretty dead. If you want to play with a bunch of randoms, or play competative this is not the game for you. (I would suggest TGOpro Devpro if that is what you are looking for) There are very few people on to play with randoms. For both quickplay games and competative. However, if you have a friend (or a few) that you want to play Yu-Gi-Oh with this game fills that prefectly. You can easily set up games to play with your friends and everything works as it should. (Note: there is not voice or written communication in any multiplayer mode so if you want to play with a friend I would suggest discord or teamspeak or skype or something so you can talk to each other)TLDR;If you are looking for randoms to play with stay away. If you just want to play with friends it does a good job.DLCI would only suggest buying a dlc pack if it has cards that you specifically want. (don't just buy all of the DLC) It is worth noting that not all of the cards are available with the base game. You do need to buy the DLC to get some of the cards. However, for the most part there are a ton of cards in the base game and most people I talk to only have to buy a DLC pack or two to get all of the cards they need for more competative decks. (#fluffal deck is life)Summary: Great game if you want a singleplayer Yu-Gi-Oh or to play it with friends. If you want to play with randoms you will be disapointed.Throw away notes.There are animations when certain monsters attack. ie Blue Eyes White Dragon. It gets old pretty quick. Not high quality and unskippable.Tip: if you have a quick cast spell or a trap card hold down cancel (right mouse button for keyboard) to skip through the check messages.Exodia is a cheap and easy way of farming currency in this game.Play through campain to unlock more packs to buy.Buying card packs works like any other card game I have ever played. (You get random cards from that person's stash)Look in community guides to see who has whatever card you want. (use Ctrl + F)Fun game where you can make a multitude of silly decks."

,Recommended,480650,32380911,Posted: 12 June,all,Sigma,"Let me say this game is rather meh. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and gave it a positive feedback.Firstly I just want to say I love Yu-Gi-Oh! I know the game's advanced rules and decks so I'm not just saying like newbs are saying ""i enjoy duelist kingdom because it was season 1"".This game does suffer a few drawbacks.1. Slow pack opening. Prepare to sit there for 20 minutes trying to open packs to complete your collection.2. Duplicate cards from packs means you could spend your hard earned DP from 5 hours of work and still not get that 1 single card to complete your collection. (btw collecting doesnt' affect anything, it's just for bragging rights and of course collection purposes).3. Empty multiplayer. For a game that has its own servers, this is a sad display of trying to present multiplayer. There is a half @$$ excuse for a lobby, meaning you can join any game you want that's currently open. But the problem is nobody is online to wait for someone else to join. Once you join there is no indication for the other player telling them that someone joined their game and that the game is ready for you both to engage in a duel. NONE WHATSOEVER. You might encounter games where the other player won't start the game ever. I don't blame them, i would be afk too if i had to wait that long.4. No chat zone. There's no chatting in this game, because after all it's a children's card game and konami doesn't want children to see explicit messages... yeah i'm pretty sure that's the reason XD.5. Unskippable animations. Some cards do have animations, but not all of them do. However once you play your favorite card that has an animation, prepare to see it a million times because it's unskippable!6. Terrible cpu decks. You can get through the whole campaign with some half-@$$ built deck. This could be a good thing though because what if suddenly all you were facing each duel were mirror forces over and over again? And I'm not saying it like mirror force is OP, because it's not. So I guess just be glad the cpu decks are awful.7. Paywall dlc. Nothing beats requiring $20 for main game + $80+ bucks worth of dlc to unlock special highly favorable cards to play with! DLC cards can only be gotten by paying money. There is no way of getting them for free from the main game itself.So that's just my gripes with this game. You can probably endure a few of these like not minding or playing with dlc cards, slow pack opening, multiplayer, etc. With that said, there are a good number of positive qualities about this game but to not bore you, I'll only list the ones I find very special.1. No ban list for single player and invite-only multiplayer! Ever wanted to use 3x pot of greeds just for entertainment purposes? Yep, go ahead and play single player. Or hilariously give an EFF YU to your friends by asking them to invite you to their duel so you can use a banned deck to win on turn 1!2. Battle packs/ drafting. A neat feature that's not in any other yugioh game is the ability to play draft. Unfortunately the selection of cards is limited but it evens out because you can play with other real players so every deck is virtually ""equal"" in terms of strength. It's mostly entirely up to the player's drafting abilities and then further down is how well you play your own cards. Anybody can get into this mode, even newbies.3. Challenges and reverse duels. The main game, minus dlc, has a lot of content to keep you busy. Once you beat all the duelists normally on story mode you can reverse duel, taking the role of the bad guy and dueling to defeat the good guys! Sounds fun don't you think? Pegasus beating Yugi Moto? It never happened but with reverse duel it did!Challenges are there to further test your skills against well built advanced decks. There's a lot of content so you're definitely getting your 20 bucks worth out of it.So overall, it's a good game. I wouldn't play this game just for multiplayer though. Use other alternatives for that. But other than that, this is also a good game to get started on yugioh if you have never played it before.8.5/10 Promising but not the best. Not exactly for the most dire of fans but is enjoyable to say the least."

,Recommended,480650,32242026,Posted: 7 June,all,CaptOblivious,"The game is great and provides a lot of nostalgia for those of us who played or watched the anime. It let's you play the duels in the shows using the same cards that were in the show, which I prefer more than using my own decks to obliterate the NPC. It also has a huge selection of cards even without DLC. It also has a few good game modes like playing as the opponent in the campaign, challenge mode with actual usable decks used by the computer, and battle pack mode which gives you a random deck from booster packs.However it does have a bunch of design choices that makes me scratch my head.1. The game only let's you buy one pack at a time. Each pack only has 8 cards in them. This is really annoying. Why didn't they let us buy multiple packs at once? Even 10 packs at once is better than 8 cards at a time. Even the other games had this feature, so no idea why it's not on here.2. No option to disable the attack animations, even just for singleplayer. The animations are a good addition but seeing Blue Eyes attack a face down monster every turn can get irritating.3. Long animations for things like summoning. Some of them like Pendulum and XYZ summoning just take a few seconds longer than necessary.4. DLC locked cards. This isn't too much of a problem since the game already provides a huge card pool, but I enjoy Chaos, Masked HEROs, and Red Eyes decks. Some of the cards for these decks are locked by DLC.5. Not enough people on multiplayer. Most of them are playing things like Dueling Network and YGOPRO.6. No gallery or anything related. It's a minor thing, but would of been nice to see all the cards in like a binder or something.Other than those problems I have, the game is really enjoyable and definitely something worth buying, especially for someone like me who can't get into the actual game anymore due to it being expensive as hell."

More puzzle oriented than Hearthstone or similar, but you can still build your deck like in an TCG. The game is not too fast-paced and you can redo tutorials if you have trouble remembering things. New mechanics are usually easily learned and intuitive, which is good for someone like me who has quit the actual Yu-Gi-Oh card game for becoming too different from how you learned to play it and getting all rusty because of it.  The game also summarizes the plot from the show for those who don't know it, and is skippable for those who don't care for it.Unfotunately, the cutscenes are just a little wooden, they need more life and spark. There is also the fact 5Ds is in it, I have no problem with it because no actual motorbike driving is involved in the gameplay (I'm terrible at driving games), but some people might.Still a solid 8/10, actually made me feel a sense of victory and nostalgia. But I am stuck on how to defeat a few specific characters."
,Recommended,480650,33640462,Posted: 18 July,all,Pyro,"So I've been a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh since I was 6, over a decade now. While I've grown up with the game I've learned how to play the game properly and expanded to other trading card games such as Pokemon, Magic, Digimon, and whatever the hell else at the time. Yu-Gi-Oh still had a special place in my heart and I've had games on the Gameboy and PS3 but when I saw this I was hit with an immediate ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ all of the generations in one- sick"". After playing it to literal 100% completion (meaning I did every campaign and the reverse battles) I can say this game is definetely Yu-Gi-Oh. Strategic deck building and luck of the draw. Sometimes you'll get completely ♥♥♥♥ed and if you thought Yugi Moto was bad in the show then wait till you ♥♥♥♥ing play against Yuma, I can assure you I could beat Yugi at least 30 times before I could defeat Yuma once BUT I still loved the challenge and would continue to try spite the fact I had already lost 10 times already. I should've probably adapted to the later generations but I continued to use the same decks I had created during gen one. The decks that carried me were an Exodia deck and a dragon deck with a random mix of other cards. If you're a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh then I'd suggest getting this if you have the money, plus you won't really need to pay for extra decks because you get so much in game currecny you're able to buy whatever you want almost immediately. Have fun."

The answer to this question is also yes! It's needs steam sales, which could bring new players into the game. Because at this moment, online playing is (not sure how to describe it, but i'll go with this word) lackluster.  7/10 for now. Would be 9.5/10 if there was a lot of players willing to play online.

We've all played it and remember the old anime on tv, this game allows you to play through those memorable duels in the story all the way up to Zexal. The game plays well although the story decks can be... pretty bad to play with but it's no problem since you can buy card packs with in game currency which is not hard to collect as by the time you finish the  story modes you'll have enough to buy enough packs to create a deck to send people to the shadow realm. My critisism on this is the very very annoying pop up every time you have a trap card which can activate since you have to keep telling the game you do not want to activate over and over. Also the card packs can only be bought 1 at a time which sucks when you want to buy a tonne of them since you'll need to for better chances at the best cards. Overall fans of Yu-gi-oh will love this! 8/10"

It gets tedious to play after a while but still fun for yugioh fans. Wish there were more players in the multiplayer matches though. There has been no updates on this game. However, if they ever do make an update, I would like them to add a favorites function (to easily grab cards that I use across all decks), and a multi-purchase funtion for card packs. It gets tiring scrolling through all the cards and clicking so many times to buy a certain pack."

Some cards ask every.. single.. phase change if you would like to use that card (looking at you rush recklessly) disrupting gameplay.  If i want to use a card I KNOW when to use it and do not need the game to ask me every single phase. It gets super aggravating.2. The graphics are terrible (boards, textures, effects). Monster animations look like they were made on the original playstation.3.The cards are too small so players cant really appreciate the artwork. This produces a very underwhelming ""I thought i just summoned a cool card"" effect.Like I've said though the game is far to fun to let these cons prevent a purchase. If you like Yu-Gi-Oh or are looking for a card game this is definitely worth the money."

I haven't tried online games or DLC games, but gameplay in single player is very well made. A few game crashes here and there, but its still one of the first PC ports for years so I think its acceptable. I hope more PC ports would come later on, maybe rest of the bugs would be resolved during that time...+ Huge number of cards+ Obtaining cards is very fast compared to other titles I've been played+ Single player has a lot of things to do+ ""Reverse Matches"" (you can play with your opponents deck after you have beated him/her)- Easily bored soundtrack (like 4 different tracks during matches)- Forbidden cards can be only played if you have completed the story deck- Random crashes"

It has a great selection of cards and I hope we see future support. In terms of the DLC you do not need it to enjoy this game. The only downside is that if you are a huge fan of the anime some duels are left out completly(such as all of season 3 of DM and crashtown from 5d's or the entire supreme king arc) But over all It isnt half bad if you are into casual card games also a good way to get into Yu-gi-oh should you wish it

,Recommended,480650,34404478,Posted: 21 August,all,Insignificance,"Firstly I'd like to address something important: I loved this game and play it often but many people don't and I can asure you the price is far to expensive and unless you know you really want this game for the price it's at and you know you have the money to spare then I reccomend for anyone looking to duel it out online with digital decks then Ygopro is what you're looking for and it's a great free software for dueling. If Konami uptated the card list more then this game might be worth it given it covers the 5 animes and has a storyline and specific duels to compliment the anime storyline but because of the limits I can't garuntee this is really what you want. I personally find it hard to use the messy interface of Ygopro as well as the fact I have to use the brand new game rules which are terrible. This game givens me a cleaner interface with the old classic rules.To put it simply this game is only reccomended to those who have alot of money to spare on a game with their top priority being story and a smooth interface and if you're looking for multiplayer then use Ygopro.With that over and done with we can begin.Gameplay:The single player duel campaigns and challenges rum smooth with little difficulty, during the duelist of course you will be able to use one of your own decks (max 10 slots) or the deck of the duelist your playing as. There are packs assigned to certain duelists and it doesn't take long to grind currency. If you want to build the deck of a certain duelist you can see if they have a certain pack and also check the guide that was put up for where certain cards are. As you complete certain duels you'll receive template's for the duelists deck and the cards let's say for Kite can be optained by dueling him or opening his booster packs in the card shop. As for multiplayer then I suggest using a different platform such as Ygopro as this game is highly underpopulated. The real reason I use this more then YgoPro is the smooth and clear interface. There are a fair amount of cards but high chances are you'll usually find alot of cards you're looking for don't exist in the database, there are ways to make it so you unlock all the cards through messing with the game files. If you are lacking cards the DLC is also a possibility to find them. All in all I give the dueling gameplay a 9/10, deck construction gameplay a 10/10 and the card detabase a 5/10.Downloadable content (DLC):The downloadable content is really good put given the price of the game itself is way too much I think the DLC  should be free and that would maybe help to justify the price but regardless that isn't the case and with Konami can we be suprised? I think when it comes to DLC it really depends on if you need the cards that come with it. The only DLC I own is the Joey DLC and I'm glad I got it because it allows me to build an amazing Red-Eyes deck. While I don't know the others I do know that Joey's DLC has some pretty powerful card combos for Red-Eyes decks so it all depends on what decks you're making. To put it simply the DLC is only something you should really buy if you need it's respective cards. I give the DLC card content 9/10 and the campaign content 5/10.Storyline:The game does an alright job at portraying the main parts of the storyline duels from the animes so I'll give it a 6.5/10 for portraying the anime storyline.Conclusion:It's one of those games you really need to think about before buying and look into what it is offering, in total I give the game 7/10 which would be higher by a few points if the game had a more updated card database."

I never followed anything passed the first generation, when it came to the TV show and nothing passed the second generation of cards. It's okay though. Luckily, you get to skip all the B.S. storyline and skip straight to the battle. The duelist challenges are hell of legit. Very hard, but rewarding if you can defeat the enemy. Personal card suggestion: Minor Goblin Official. Your opponent pays 500 LP every standby turn. Their LP has to be 3000 or less and its a trap card you can activate once it's the opponent's draw phase. It is amazing. Play it. Worth the $20.00 . The price is a good deal. Would've paid $40 for it."
