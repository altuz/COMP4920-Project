76561197970635187,Recommended,480690,24124277,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,jferman,"As a fan of Missile Command on the Atari 2600, I had fun. Great graphics, good sound design, challenging gameplay. I like the addition of mechs as land-based attackers, and while I eventually felt overwhelmed it never felt unfair.There is room for improvement:* The explosions could use more bass.* Some haptic feedback in the controllers when firing and maybe when nearby explosions occur might add to the experience.* I'm not sure if my play area was a few feet too small or the in-game play area was offset towards the rear, but the gameplay made me want to reach just six inches beyond my chaperone bounds. It would be nice to have an option to recalibrate the center of the virtual play area.* As another reviewer mentioned, weapon upgrades and the like would be great. Maybe they're already in the game and I didn't get far enough to acquire them.All in all, I think it's a good game. If the developer acts on at least a few of the above suggestions, this game could really excel."

,Recommended,480690,24364317,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,arleas,"This review can be shortened to a single sentence:  ""It's 3D VR Missile Command!""  So if you ever played the old Atari Missile Command game in the Arcade (or the home versions) you already know basically how to play this.For those younger folks and/or people who never played a video game before 1990... Missile Command was basically a set of base structures to protect and a main base with a limited number of missiles that can be fired.  Above you, you would see a bunch of streaming lines indicating incoming missiles which if they hit your base structures they'd destroy it.  Occasionally a plane or UFO or something would go overhead as well.Well ""Inbound"" is almost the same way, except that it's 3D instead of 2D, it's VR instead of 2D... and you have laser turrets instead of missiles.  You still have the base structures to protect, and your turrets can take a few hits before they're destroyed and that may or may not affect your ability to continue defending.As with missile command enemy ships will fly overhead to take shots at your base and you can use the lasers to take them out.Unlike Missile command, you've also got some mechs that will walk in and sometimes hover/jet in mid air to take shots at your base.  There are also some ground based vehicles that will roll in and shoot at your base.  For these threats you use grenades that are launched from the turrets (this part feels closer to missile command) and occasionally you get some land mines that you can deploy the same as grenades, but instead of blowing up a few seconds later, they stay in place a bit longer.The game ends when all your base structures are destroyed (I had to stop myself from saying ""all your base are belong to us"").  Though it might also end if your turrets are taken out without having to wait for the base structures to be destroyed as well.Things I liked:It really is just like I would have imagined 3D/VR Missile commandYou can easily see where you're aiming, so you don't have to make guesses (which would be harder to do since you're in a 3rd person style setup)The graphics are nice and you don't notice a ""screen door effect"" while you're playing it at all. Some games made text hard to read, but everything seems set up just right.Things I didn't like:The grenade attacks were pretty unsatisfying.  It felt like it was just better to spam grenades in the general direction of any threat on the outside chance it might destroy it at a distanceSpeaking of the distance thing, it's impossible to aim at something too far off, so I felt like I had to lean in to get some of the shotsThe game could use an option to reset where you're standing as the 'center'. I'm not sure if it was by chance or design but I was not far from the boundary of my game play area and so I constantly had to get close to the edge to protect some buildings. Seeing the chaparone bounds is a big turnoff.It's not always clear how/when you can use the land mines.  I feel like you should have half the button devoted to grenades and the other half to land mines.Otherwise though, this game is awesome and I can definitely see myself spending more time playing it.  It doesn't use much of the room scale play area so you could potentially even play it sitting down if you wanted. You will still have to stretch to get to all the areas of your base to fire at incoming missiles though."

The early hype of VR games is already waning.  Im starting to get harder to please becuase the bedazzlement of VR is past the honey moon stage.  I recomend passing on this or waiting till its about $5. Unless you dont mind spending $15 for 15 min of entertainment."

I'd like to toss in a more elaborate proposition: There should be a currency based on score. This currency would accumulate. From a store, we could buy assisting turrets with various grades of efficiency, which are single-use (are gone after one run). The assisting turrets would be automated, the higher the cost the greater the accuracy.All in all I'm satisfied with what I've seen so far."

Everything sounds and looks great, I love the space backgrounds. The controls are simple, but the game gets challenging quickly as more and more attacks are sent your way."
,Recommended,480690,24162926,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,ForceKin,"This game is a lot of fun. It actually feels like a game, not a tech demo. It's well polished and has some really intense moments. The sound and visuals are very pleasant and the controls are responsive and smooth. I plan to spend quite some time playing it and going for leadboard high scores. Definitely worth checking out, especially while it's on sale."

Problem is if you are past the honeymoon period of the VIVE, this game will leave you empty. It is interesting for probably 30 minutes then becomes quite boring, it needs something more to its gameplay for the wow factor. A decent title but not worth $16, there are better titles out there with more replay value."

IMO, the game is just on the borderline of value for the money.That all being said, the level of graphic and audio polish is very nice, and the game play isveryfun.I do have a few suggestions that I think would make it better:A better tutorial (maybe in the actual game space, pausing the game to show you how to do things)Better grenade aimingDifficulty levelsMore opportunities to repair your baseThe dev has also been quite active interacting with the community, which is a big plus for me."

This is a very polished game.  It is way better than missile commands from the 80s.   You have 4 environments with missles, airplanes, drones and mechs that attacks you.   The environments are beautifully done.  The action is non-stop.  I would recommend this highly."

,Recommended,480690,33017158,Posted: 29 June,all,Game Cooker US Rocks VR,"My Specs:GPU: GeForce GTX 1070CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHzMemory: 16 GB RAM (15.94 GB RAM usable)Inbound is a great VR arcade title and lives up to the description of being similar to Missle Command.Graphics are good, gameplay is fun and both hands are required to progress. When I used to go to the mall arcades back in the 80's as a young man Missle Command was one of my favorites and Inbound doesn't dissappoint bringing that experience to the new millenium. The dev seemed to have made the game in a way that the waves are changed up a bit. Some are normal length and some are surprises and quickly completed. This game came out a year ago or so and I wish I bought it way back when. Even for the regular price of $12 or whatever it is it is worth a buy. Someone was suggesting a seated experience but I think standing is the best way to play as I was reaching a lot to get a little closer to the missles before they out ran my reaction time. If you like wave shooters and arcade type games in VR then get this. I don't like wave shooters and arcade VR much but I liked this one. It is good to give yourself a quick fix and improve your reaction time with both arms working to win.Game play video below in HD and 4k. Thanks and enjoy.https://youtu.be/fMY02VjlEeg"

Loved missle command when I was a kid and put a lot more quarters in that game that makes the price for inbound  seem like a bargain :)Great graphics and sound.Of course thier has to be a but,I don't know if it's just me but the aiming system seems flat to me. really hard to judge depth. maybe if the crosshair was more dynamic. Shrinking the crosshair or morphing the shape  when your aiming farther.As an example when I'm teleporting in Vanishing Realms pointing the circle to aim your leap, the software gives you a good simulation  of of how far your moving.I'm glad you made it and look forward spending more time in the game."
