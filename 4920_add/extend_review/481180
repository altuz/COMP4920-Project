,Recommended,481180,24663329,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,Otter Chaos,"I'm pretty crappy at deckbuilding card games.  I don't get it.  I don't get Magic the Gathering, I don't get Pokemon, I don't get Deckbuilder:  Rise of the Expensive Pile of Cards.What I do get are the things this game draws on for inspiration.  Shadowrun.  Blade Runner.  William Gibson.  Shadowrun again.  I can relate to these things.  Which is odd really, since they all take place in the future, and I've never been there.  I guess what it comes down to is that I'm from the past, and in the past the future seemed a lot cooler than the present it came to be.  I never got a cyberdeck.  I never got to try a BTL chip, which is probably a good thing actually.  Heck, I never got to score the nuyen to go slumming in Tir Tairngire.What I did get though, is System Crash.  A deckbuilding card game based on all of the things I mentioned above.  So I gave it a try, and it seems to be pretty cool.  I've lost some battles, and am still learning how to make a deck that covers all the bases, but at least the subject matter is familiar, and that helps me be interested enough to keep going.If you're into the whole CCG thing, or into the cyberpunk theme, I think this is worth a go.  Maybe I'll see you in the shadows chummer."

Combining it with a story (or campaign, if you like) creates an amazingly fun game to play. You get new cards as a reward for successful runs (= card matches), so no need to buy stuff in order to win. A fresh concept done well."

76561198072044943,Recommended,481180,25578117,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,Wendek,"It's admittedly a relatively simple game mechanics-wise - you'll have seen basically every possible strategy after a few hours (since all the main variants are used by the AI), and it won't take long to learn how to trick the AI either. Nevertheless it's still enjoyable to play (I tend to prefer my card games relatively casual-friendly) and the story is actually quite nicely done with pretty good writing.The game suffers from a bit of negative difficulty curve because some of your first opponents will already have Elite cards when you're stuck with the basic cards. Once you're able to build an actual deck with a working strategy, the game becomes much simpler - the final battle is possibly one of the easiest of the entire game. Not that it's the only game to suffer from that - The Witcher series is known for it and is still excellent after all.You'll have to do a second playthrough if you want every achievement (because there are two choices during the campaign) - the total took me 30h, including some grinding in my second playthrough for the ""Have 200k in the bank"" one.Basically : it's a cheap but enjoyable single-player card game. Nothing more, nothing less - still worth its small price for me especially since most card games are geared towards competition/PvP so there's not much concurrence on the single-player market.There's been some talk of expansions down the line and I will gladly purchase them."
76561198066378073,Recommended,481180,34432993,Posted: 23 August,all,SHODAN,"I’ve been on Steam for over 5 years with this account, own over a hundred games, and never once written a review. System Crash is the game that now gets that honor.TL;DR - System Crash is an excellent example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Good gameplay, art, music, and story combine to make an excellent game.I’ve done two main play-throughs in story mode as well as many standalone matches.  In my first time through I focused more on the story and less on the mechanics. As has been noted, the story isn’t a timeless classic, but a good example of genre-fiction. The plot is pretty formulaic, but well-executed with snappy dialogue. And it did leave me wondering what might come next for the main character if the world got to be explored more deeply (hopefully in a sequel!).In my second play-through I started to realize that the mechanics were deeper than I originally realized. Whereas before, I had played through basically with one style, just adding the most powerful cards as I earned them, the second time I experimented with a number of different card combinations. I also think the AI was substantially improved in-between the times that I played, which made the standalone matches more fun, which also made the game more of something that I could pick up for a few matches and then put down until the next few. Something that I think is really valuable when you’re trying to balance gaming with other life priorities.As you can see, I am currently approaching 50 hours with System Crash. Having recently completed my second go through, I probably won’t be playing much for a bit. But I know that the mechanics are deep enough that I will definitely have at least another round."

The production values are high, and while there are some awkward UI elements here and there (the deck builder interface never quite clicked for me, for example) the game overall is highly polished and a lot of fun.The game begins with some easier missions to get you familiar the basic mechanics, and then as you begin earning new cards and credits for select purchases you get the hang of customizing decks to implement different play styles and to counter difficult specialist opponents. An engaging cyberpunk theme ties your missions together and interacts with the gameplay in gratifying ways, such as when the victory condition changes to ""survive X turns"" when you're tasked to hold a enemy until an ally can escape, or when an entrenched security force gets an overall armor bonus for the match duration.With respect to the deck-building, there are a select few ""no brainer"" cards that you should covet immediately but System Crash does an excellent job of presenting you with trade-offs between the available cards and strategies, which kept me engaged the whole game and forced a few ""back to the ol' drawing board"" moments upon encountering new opponents.If you're a fan of CCG-style combat, definitely pick this one up. The synergy between the storyline, the game mechanics, and the evocative art & music elevate this game above most others in the genre."

The storytelling (which I was not expecting at all) was fairly good and the gameplay was challenging.Many different decks and strategies are possible, and the balance seems to be in the right place - I played the first few missions with runners and criminals and them switched to hackers and managed to breeze throught the storyline with few problems.The LCG model is really interesting and I would love to see more games like it in steam.

Heaps of atmosphere, good single player campaign and an easy learning curve. I was mostly afraid of the other card games where you either have to drop a ton of money to get good cards on you are up against veteran players that ""eat noobs for breakfast"" with their super decks.Wether or not it is worth 15 euro's, I'll let you decide.

,Recommended,481180,34526326,Posted: 27 August,all,CelJaded,"System Crash can be an eclectic mix at times, but its entertaining jumble of ideas isn't likely to leave card junkies feeling disappointed.Players deploy assassins to the streets, they employ hackers to siphon data from secure servers, and they install virus programs to further undermine their opponent's conflicting operations. And despite all of this, System Crash is a card game that feels a lot more like Andrew Garfield's Magic: The Gathering than his cyberpunk-themed hit called Netrunner.Its backstory is peppered with evil corporations and heroic ""runners"" vying for dominance in a futuristic city with its in-game cards representing everything from informants to turret systems, and street-level coppers to military-grade assault mechs. And yet the gameplay itself is still quite familiar as you assign 'Agents' to the lanes in front of you and watch them do battle with opposing troops backed by equipment or supporting tactics.Like Magic, each Agent has an attack and defence value as well as a keyword, special ability, and (usually) a flavour snippet. Anyone familiar with card games of this style will have absolutely no trouble diving into their first session and overall things are quite easy to gets to grips with.The applaudable 'living card game' model that developer Rogue Moon Studios has adopted here is an unfortunate rarity in digital card games at the moment. You're given complete freedom in the main campaign module to do whatever quests you want in order to earn credits and aside from a basic 'four of a kind' rule, there are very few policies that you need to follow when constructing decks.Assuming that you can afford it (and you're crazy enough) System Crash has absolutely no problem with you filling your deck with as many rare or ""Elite"" cards as you want, so if the idea of a grip full of rampaging Patriot Mechs appeals to you, then go for it!There are many gameplay hours in the default campaign, even to the point where it gets a little tedious, honestly, but the enticing theme and attractive artwork will maintain your interest even when your main deck looks 'complete'. There's not a huge amount of troubleshooting needed between missions either, so if you're the sort of player who likes to create one strategy and tweak one particular kind of deck to the moon, then you won't be hugely penalised for it.The potential strategies in the core card pool are all fairly straightforward though (with the aggro/hacking rush being extremely strong right now) and it won't be long before you've seen everything that the AI enemies have to offer in terms of approach.The campaign storyline attempts to keep things fresh by weaving a typical conspiracy yarn and aside from some occasionally ropey dialogue, it does a decently entertaining job of it. I just wish I could understand why some cards don't have flavour text. It's a simple inclusion that can do wonders for world building and in a digital card game; where you have the space needed to display such snippets, there is simply no excuse for cards looking ""incomplete"" like this. Seriously, it's a missed opportunity that had a massive bullseye pinned to its♥♥♥♥♥♥Some players might further lament the lack of multiplayer mode, but the biggest potential gripe with System Crash has to do with the originality of its premise because let's face it; the game doesn't really do anything that Magic: The Gathering hasn't already done many times before it.System Crash can't compete with Magic's fluid card play either. It does successfully meld in pieces of Netrunner whilst also borrowing some nice bits from Hearthstone, and yet System Crash feels more rigid because of its strict adherence to phases. There are no moments when cards can be played out of turn, units are limited to four slots on the board at once, and if players don't keep up with the in-game cost/power ratio then they'll quickly find themselves falling behind.Nevertheless, Rogue Moon Studios has clearly created a very generous package with the budget it had available and it's one that marks a promising departure from the commerce-obsessed trappings of the wider genre.Read the full review at my blog »"

I loaded it to check the options and an hour flew by without noticing it.The game play is basically Magic the Gathering, except you have one ressource and its pool grows every turn, so the longer you play, the more ressources you have every turn.  ""Enchantment"" cards play the same, except they last for a set number of turns.The artwork is attractive and the story makes you feel like a shadowrunner.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to hear they made this after being denied the Shadowrun licence, it feels exactly like it.Completely addictive, fun and highly recommended!"

Cards selling for 1/2 cost and perhaps Elite cards costing 5K instead of 10K. I would like to experiment more with interesting deck ideas during the campaign without grinding a lot to acquire the cards or grind in postgame arcade mode (Arena) just to test the potential limits of decks in the game.- Could have more varied soundtrack- Lacks 1920 x 1080 sceen support- Felt the texts and some of the GUI were very weary on the eyes to read, compared to some free CCGs like Hex, Infinity etc.Finished the game with around 70K gold, 11 elite, 5 veteran cards missing to complete collection and only played the Arena 3 times.Overall not a bad CCG game with solid campaign to scratch the itch without need to grind for campaign progression."

The game alludes to your past, but (IMHO) leaves you scope to add to the prologue (in your mind) if you feel the need.  You begin by choosing your avatar...and then you're swept up in a series of events and intrigue as your return to SanAn is anything but uneventful.The story is usually progressed by a card game against a thematically apt AI deck.

,Recommended,481180,26455192,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Tymbuctoo,System Crash is a very nice card game. I do not like Magic The Gathering or Hearthstone for their online competitive focus. This one is a singleplayer card game with an actual storyline. And great cyberpunk artwork. It is easy to learn while the amount of cards allows for a wide range of tactics. Surprisingly the deckbuilding itself can get somewhat annoying as there are not enough filters to look for specific items like faction cards.After every mission/battle you get to loot cards and credits with which you can buy additional cards that fit your playstyle. The AI opponents are also quite able so you have to use the cards you got in the right way or even build a new deck to counter certain faction tactics like hacking. It is definitely my favorite card game in 2016.

The story is good, has a real Shadowrun vibe to it, although no orcs or magic etc.The mechanics are quite simple compared to a lot of CCGs but still satisfying and theres enough variety of cards to have tactical options. The AI is reasonable.So far I haven't had to beat any encounter by designing a bespoke deck especially for it which means I think means the balance is good. Having said that, I think that means the game could afford to give you more resources to buy the cards. Since its single player and even the ""elite"" tier of cards isn't particularly OP, I did find it a little frustrating that I can't always design the deck I want because of lack of resources - there is a mechanic to grind out money if you want to do this but really it seems a little pointless in this format. I guess this last point boils down to personal preference and some might say that there would be nothing to work towards if all cards were easy to get. I'm still at the point of working through the story tho, and sometimes I'd just like to switch to another fleshed-out deck, just for the sake of variety.Anyway thats a relatively minor point and the game is definately worth it."

If your familiar with that style at all you'll very quickly be able to pick up and play this one; however, minor differences change the paradigm enough to make the game feel unique and require different strategy than one might apply in other games.

Been missing out on playing Android:Netrunner a lot so I was keeping half an eye out on some alternatives and now here we have it :) Loved the Gibsonesque intro (style of dialogues is very different from the intro style, which is a shame as that was a really good moodsetter!) and the little references to cyberpunk games and movies (is there someone who doesn't see Angelina Jolie's Kate aka Acid Burn in Jynx?). 90 minutes into the game I'm still missing out on more varied methods to get cards (as the 100/1000 sell/buy set prices I see on c1 cards is a bit too much at first) but all in all I'd actually love to see this is a pack of LCG cards we can flip on the table with friends, as that would be a great gift. (Also, higher tier cards could actually start glitching out your game client's visuals or graphics, that would totally be appropriate in the game world, although not everyone would enjoy it, I guess :) ) All in all - great ideas, smooth gameplay and I'm really looking forward to seeing more of the System Crash universe.

I am a huge fan of Gibson's 'Neuromancer' and the film 'Blade Runner', so I figured It'd be worth a shot for $13.50. I've somewhat enjoyed deck building games in the past, but they weren't my favourite. However, I've always been a huge fan of the Shadowrun games, and some of the imagery reminded me of them.All of those influences are there in rather obvious ways. I'd even add in a bit of Satellite Reign. The story is full with good reasoning behind everything that happens. However, while there are options to choose from for dialogue responses, they don't seem to affect the outcome. So don't expect this to be a choice-based story at all.That said, finding the cards by chance along the way, and knowing that you can eventually unlock every one of them without paying a single extra cent, is a satisfying thing. The developers for this game really hit the mark with this game. Outside of one or two bugs (literally one, maybe two), the gameplay experience has been very smooth and the wins satisfying. You WILL need to adapt your strategy to the various fights you experience. As far as I can tell, there's no obvious be-all, end-all build.I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been!EDIT: Finished the story line, and decided to add a couple of notes.First, while they aren't dialogue, there are definitely choices that take you on different routes through the story. I know of at least two possible endings.Second, there are points in the story where you end up having to complete missions with pre-built decks representing other characters, and adding a whole different type of difficulty to the game (speaking of, there are no difficulty settings. It seems to just ramp up throughout the story)"
,Recommended,481180,24684483,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,Anterk,"System crash is a card game where two players use Agents and a variety of enhancements to try and reach a specific number of points first. The card designs and world remind me somewhat of what Fantasy Flight is trying to do with Netrunner, but the actual gameplay is completely different.Each turn, the agents both sides have in play attack. There is no choice not to attack, and there is no way to interrupt the attack. Combat strategy comes in enhancing your agents or debuffing the enemy agents so that you are the one who wins. However, instead of using a health system like many fantasy-based card games, System Crash is about gathering points. You can get points from attacking your enemy directly with an agent, or through card abilities. It's actually easier to focus on winning through card abilities then in destorying your opponent's agents, which is likely a reflection of the cyberpunk hacker angle the game is going for.Over $10 is probably too much for what this game offers. The writing is surprisingly compelling and I like the music. The points system and lack of health system make the game a tad simplistic, but as a Cyberpunk fan who has never had enough time for Netrunner I've found this game very enjoyable. If you're a fan of all things cyberpunk and trying Netrunner gave you an itch you don't have time to scratch I recommend you pick up this game. Otherwise, wait until this is under $10."

It's a true ""limited league"" environment where you start with a crappy pile of cards and you work at it by defeating enemies and gaining cards and completing quests to gain credits and buying more cards, eventually crafting the perfect deck to stomp everyone in the field.

The number of cards and variations of decks is limited, but big enough to give you 15-20 hours of grinding for cards and experimenting with decks before it gets old. There is a campaign in a form of an interactive story -- pretty formulaic, but a solid piece of genre ficion. The soundtrack is good, and it might stay in your playlist long after you leave the game itself behind."

There's no other game like it on steam that combines both elements. I felt like I was exploring the card version of Deus Ex or Bladerunner. There's freedom of choice and multiple solutions to every challenge. Everything from the game play, story, art and music are very well done and creative. There's even the free Night Terrors update that comes with the game and extends the experience. So you can add horror to the cyberpunk mix, a rare and beautiful thing! :) The tournament mode keeps me coming back. Many thanks to Rogue Moon Studios for making creating such an inspiring game that filled several voids in the gaming world. I can't wait to see what you make next! Now to play some more System Crash! :D"

A 250-credit game could be significantly harder to win than one valued at 400c or 900c.The AI can be extremely lucky with card draw or completely overmatched. I've played tournament matches where every card I put into play, the AI could counter it and others where I win hands down in minutes with a mediocre draw hand.When players win a tournament, most of the time the bonus is credits. I was playing the tournament to help build my deck so I could continue the campaign. I wouldn't expect every win to result in a veteran or elite card, but a few more non-credit bonuses would be nice.Also:In a Black Market you would expect to be able to buy some stronger cards not just customize your deck from cards won. Setting prices based on card rarity could make them difficult to buy, but at least then, they are available.It would be great if this had a multiplayer option.It has frozen a few times during runs and the only option was to close the game. Thankfully, It auto-saves.Overall, enjoyable if you like deckbuilding games."

,Not Recommended,481180,27603328,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Nimraaz,"Can't recommend this game. It isn't bad and is definitely unique in its niche being cyberpunk single-player CCG (this genre tag cloud is about the single unique thing about this game though). But it's really a super low budget bare-bones product made on Unity Personal Edition probably by just a couple of dudes. Everything in the game is presented in plain text, there is no animation whatsoever, even the UI is fixed at 4:3 ratio. The story? I don't know, I played for half an hour and it was just some generic cyberpunk babble with meaningless dialogue options. The game system is nothing to write home about either, it's rather primitive and uninspired, there is nothing new or quirky, just generic card battles you may find in free web flash games on Kongregate or something. Once again, the game isn't bad and is pretty playable with some nice artwork and decent music, and if you really don't care about spending money on a shallow timewaster it may be a good purchase, but I just don't feel that the price is justified for what is presented and I have no desire to waste my time with the game further since I really feel like I've seen it all within the first half an hour. I just see nothing special about it. Would be a decent game to invest the same amount of money in 1999 maybe, but now we have the likes of Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes for $9.99 and less and a plenty of free multiplayer alternatives that also rock decent solo content and have amazing production quality on the market, if not in cyberpunk stylistics for what they're worth. Refunded."

,Recommended,481180,28876992,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,olly!,"I may disagree with some card balancing (for example T-Boz gives a significant boost to the AI while costing only 1 credit and Neonmongers often have two of them one after another making their missions harder than it should be) but this is what I want from the CCG genre: cyberpunk setting (really tired of fantasy), an actual plot with dialogues and immersive atmosphere with good music. The only thing missing is some character progression apart from getting better cards. Missions sometimes impose effect cards and it would be great if the player could do the same (it might be actually there, I haven't played that much yet and the player credits beg to be used in some way apart from the ""gather 10k credits"" plot device).Some of the card images are drawn badly, it sticks out when you look at them close but, fortunately, just a few. The developer also made the decision to name half of the character cards with unique names. There can be two John Smiths on the same team or worse, on the competing teams. It would be better if named cards would be unique, the rest having generic class names. Another minor nitpick is that the AI decks are not that different in the missions and they consist of the same cards as the player deck. Like the lobby security card, for example. It looks pretty out of place in the player deck with player being the runner. A generic ""runner"" card with the same attributes would feel much better. But overall, it's a good value for the money asked and I'm hoping that the next game by this developer will be even better."

I dont now yet if I like it or not, but I will play some more hours... counting the hours I already played, in the worst case I had a good ""euro-hours-of-play-time"", in the better way, a new, interesting and nice made card game."

It's like Mama Netrunner and Big Daddy Shadowrun got together for a slap and tickle, hide the pickle and this being the end result. Graphics are pretty run of the mill cyber-punk.

Since then I've played it nearly non stop.The story is an excellent cyberpunk neo-noir. If you liked any of the shadowrun games, you'll like this.  And the card game allows different strategies, themed decks and so on. I'm no card game afficionado, but I enjoyed it. I found it a little hard at times, but this isn't my usual genre.A strong reccomend if you like cyberpunk games and/or card games, or at least don't dislike card games. I can't say if the actualy mechanics of the cards are good, but I enjoyed it."

I especially like the way its Campaign Mode integrates intelligently-designed card matches that mesh well with a very good and well-written story.My only complaint is that in the latter stages of the campaign, you really don`t have anything to do with all of the credits you`ve built up.Still, well worth the money. I look forward to any DLCs that may be coming."

Mechanics are simple to understand and all seems quite logical right from the start.I also love the atmosphere and art of cards along with their readability.I wish there were:- A way to manage your cards by Faction.- More Cards for each Faction.- More synergy between each Faction unit (like the way Law units work).- Modding tool to add cards/missions/campaigns (Along with Workshop support, this one would certainly require a ton of work but that would be awesome)."
