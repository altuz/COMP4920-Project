,Not Recommended,481190,35251541,Posted: 27 September,all,[F-7] Mister Naga,"As of now, public full 1.0 release, I cannot recommend this.1) There is no tutorial what-so-ever in game. You are thrust looking into your initial 'base' piece. <Has been fixed as of 1.0.2, but still very basic> 1/10/20172) Running in windowed mode seems to just 'shrink' textures and text, making models look very poor, even with max AA, as the edges are jagged. As of 1.0.2 the textures are still jagged in windowed or fullscreen, even with AA. It's more irritating on the edges/lines of objects, but it's a personal issue.3) Because there is no tutorial, and minmal UI (Aside from the messages on the right slide-out window) you can't tell what is happening, where the contracts are... no 'summary' of stats or what is going on. <There was a UI bug that has been fixed as of 1.0.2 as well> 1/10/20174) No keybinds or keyboard shortcuts displayed, if there are any5) 1/10/2017, patch 1.0.2, The game really does lack any depth, after about 4 hours of play I had a huge station, self-sufficient, with everything researched. There was nothing else to do except expand and upgrade solar panels. You only realize how little content there is to work with after you get a stable station up.Once these issues get addressed, I will update the review, but in it's current state, without watching outside sources for tutorials on how to play the game, I cannot recommend it."

Please put a total crew capacity in the status bar so it would initally read 0/1. That caused a lot of pain!I would still like the following reasonalbe changes... Ability to cancel research, Change research prioirty, have crew stay if they've just been resupplied (2 weeks worth of O2 is not critically low in the early game). Research should also scale with your progress so that you cant select a $600m item which might be impossible to complete without you running out of supplies.Key mappings are not explained (if exist at all). ""R"" for reasearch window would be great.Large Truss has a couple of backwards ports on it.* Edited review on 03-Oct-17 - 1.02: Status bar has been fixed in place and the UI scaling option is gone and ultra widescreen res does nothing. Not the fix I was looking for."

It plays a lot like a prototype.The ideas of game systems are present - research and development, crew and resource management, events and emergencies; but there really is nothing to them at this time. This is a game of trial and error, starting over and again to discover the correct sequence of moves.This should be the first stage of early access, with another 2 years to put some meat on the bones and give it a good polish. But this is the full release, where the developer and publisher have given it their stamp of approval and sent it out to the world as a mark of thier best effort at a complete PC game -  what have we become.tl;dr - This is a 6/10 mobile app charging 3 times what it's worth. Come back in 2020 if you really love space stations."

Game is still in its infancy, I would consider it a two year old that has just figured out how to walk and you can see the potential of a real runner. This is a simulation if you expect aliens to show up and lasers to defend your station, you are out of luck, I think. The developer is pushing for as much realism as he can get away with and still give us a fun time in playing it.Oh, I was hoping for ""Rocket Man"" or ""Major Tom"" but that is probably asking for a bit due to royalties."

Managed to get pretty far along in the development of my station with around 20 astronauts staying there. Lots of large labs getting that valuable research to make $$$ (Had about $20B when I turned my pc off last night). It turns out that even though u have exited the game and switched off ur pc, SOMEHOW the game continues by itself!!! All my astronauts r now dead and i'm $70B dollars in debt with 17.5kg of human waste flying around the station. I have wasted 4 hours of my time building this space station only for it to be ruined by some idiotic ""feature"" that breaks the game. Why should the game continue when ur not actually there on the game to maintain the station?!?!"

,Recommended,481190,33902792,Posted: 30 July,all,Durch,"(Linux Review - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)Stable Orbitis a space station management game with detailed, realistic graphics.  The game runs very well on Linux, and I've not encountered any of the issues reported by users of other operating systems.The game centers largely around managing resources to support the station's crew.  Crew members earn money by completing science experiments.  Earning potential scales with crew size, and larger crews require a larger station.  Building onto the station increases heat absorption, and heat must be radiated into space to prevent station damage.  The passage of time is controlled by the player, allowing for a stress-free gaming experience.Stable Orbit is an early access game that, in its current incarnation, lacks depth and difficulty.  The only challenges occur early on, as one struggles to understand how resources and systems interact.  Once figured out, designing a stable and profitable station is trivial.All in all, Stable Orbit is a good game.  It is well-suited for people with limited amounts of time on hand, as well as those who do not wish to devote a lot of time to a game.  At the same time, Stable Orbit is ideal for anyone who wants to spend hours building the largest station possible."

There isn't much to do, yet, but I like getting to the point where I'm bringing in more cash than I can spend (about 15-30 mins of gameplay) and trying to design cool space stations.  Just need more modules to add, currently there are a few locked.This game isn't for someone looking for a lot of action.  I find it to be more of a relaxation game.  When I'm stressed I get on and build a space station and zone out for about an hour.Pros:+ Graphics+ Relaxing+ Replay value is there (Building new stations)+ Very few bugs+ Updates seem to be on scheduleCons:- Needs more modules- Camera movement (Have to click and drag mouse.  Would prefer to be able to use W,A,S,D as well)- Would like to be able to save built stations edit: this feature is present with arrow selection on the right hand side of the main menu."

76561198054818376,Recommended,481190,29797820,Posted: 9 February,all,Pulsar,"Stable Orbit is a really unique and interesting experience. The short time I played this game, I was amazed by the setting and often caught myself glazing at the Earth beneath the Space Station instead of actually playing the game.However, this game is still deep in Early Access and after about one hour of play time it's extremely obvious why. Once the station is in a stable condition with enough resource containers, solar panels and radiators, there is nothing else to do than build more of the stuff that is already there.But that currently the only negative thing I have to say about Stable Orbit, since the Developer Roadmap looks pretty ambitious and I am sure that the additional features (like thrusters to maintain the orbit or additional modules) will help the game become better and more long time motivating.An additional feature I would like to see are Building Missions that provide a target to build a certain amount of a certain module (e.g. ""The European Space Travel Agency demands the presence of at least to middle sized laboratories on the station""). Reaching this goal within a certain amount of time could be rewarded with additional funds.Conclusion: A very promising game. Still lacking of content but on a very good way to become an insider."
,Not Recommended,481190,29751346,Posted: 6 February,all,FarleShadow,"Sorry Stable Orbit, but when it takes me less than 15 minutes to master your game mechanics and you fail to offer anything more challenging than: Build more stuff! then I have to say: Money back, please.A more extensive review:You start with a small module in space. You add on a lab to make you money, solar panels for energy, habitats so your astronauts can sleep and heat vents to vent heat to space.At first, it is tricky to balance it. But you figure it out. Once that's done you've won the game! (Unless you enjoy just continually building the same combination of modules over and over again while you earn billions of useless money)If you added in challenges, like random damage, debris strikes, astronaut freak outs.... any random event it might be a game. But as it stands it's little more than a Space Station Building Simulator (Think walking simulator style).I don't give scores because you can't boil games down to a number.THE END."

,Recommended,481190,35322900,Posted: 29 September,all,SciStarborne,"This game has had two patches in two days, so details of reviews are likely to go out-of-date very quickly. It's being actively worked on.I got it while 33% discounted, so my opinion is based on that price.First, this game is a roguelike, which I didn't expect. Your station is saved at the point you leave it. If your station falls out of orbit, it's gone. Loading the save just gets you an empty orbital position. There's no incremental or manual save options. It makes for an interesting mechanic.The UI currently lets it down, as it feels like it hasn't been properly audited before release. There's now a basic tutorial, but you can't globally disable it and it will prompt on each new instance. UI scaling has just been disabled to fix another bug, which means on my 1024x1280 screen, the info bar at the bottom has text about 4 pixels high, which makes judging the current status very hard. Likewise the icons are tiny. There also aren't any tooltips, where items have descriptions it appears it's missing information, resource quantities modules provide are always zero in the purchace descriptions. It also feels it's a bad omission that modules don't list their stats for production & consumption. It means it's very hard to plan ahead. What's my stations current mass? How much does this newly researched module weigh? Will my station fall out of orbit if I add it? Or will I get brown-outs from unexpectedly high power consumption?You can however wing it by watching the balance bars in the status bar, but it would be nice to plan ahead with more accuracy.Overall it's an enjoyable thing to play and quite pretty. It feels like a solid base in need of some editing. That in-game options duplicating options from the loader window seems like an example of that.I would hope that additional challenges & technologies are added later, as once you get the knack of balancing resources, I could see just waiting for research to complete get a bit tiring. Maybe a manager to hire? Or at least a way of sorting tasks by expiry or type.The only thing I'm honestly sad about is that the branching construction system means you can't reconnect ends. For example, trying to put a truss all the way around a rotating habitat as a cage.For under £7 it's made for a good few hours entertainment so far."
76561198280997227,Recommended,481190,35386975,Posted: 1 October,all,Midwinter,"For those of you who are old enough to remember Earth Orbit Stations on the Commodore 64 way back in 1987, then you're absolutely going to love this!Ok, so it's got a couple of bugs, which I've found aren't game-breaking - but don't let that put you off.Overall, it seems well designed and  even though I think that the tutorial could do with being expanded just a touch, it's thoroughly enjoyable. I'm sure the developers will be adding in new features as time goes by - or at least I hope they will because there's a lot of scope for expansion here.A couple of tips to get you started.1) Follow the tutorial. Even if you think you're goin to be a natural when you first start, follow the tutorial - then restart the game, if you wish.2) Don't be tempted into taking on a huge contract before you have the Oxygen Generator - and this is the bit that's missing in the tutorial - if you focus on money and just money too early, you'll have problems, because you'll be stuck 3/4 of the way into your research and have no money left when your crew leaves.Finally, don't forget to put RCS Thrusters onto the station. These will keep you from falling out of orbit.Overall, a great game and I'm looking forward to updates from the developers. Thoroughly recommended. It's discounted too, so give it a try...(Updated because I forgot to say about the RCS Thrusters.)"

Due to the limited starting funds there is little variation how to start the station to become self sufficient and profitable. Best hint: Start with only one small solar array and  save some funds for critical repairs and replacements. O2, H2O and other storage utilities can be upgraded to enhance capacity. Game is quite interesting until you earn enough bucks, but it becomes boring due to the lack of new challenges. Large solar panel, habitat and lab are still locked, couldn't figure out what purpose the airlock offers. This game resembles a bit the old Space M.A.X. game but seems to be unfinished. I recommend this game, because it offered for some hours great fun and in prospect of further developments it can become a real jewel.

Hopefully there will be new things added later on, i'd quite like the ability to uprgeade and have to replace older station parts with newer modules as the tech level increases (things like lower power needs, more productiong etc) if you got some spare cash i recommend this game but i don't think its worth the full price just yet."

,Not Recommended,481190,35289431,Posted: 29 September,all,JonnyG71192,"I cannot recommend this game as it is; hopefully the devs can fix most of these issues.Originally I thought this was a pre-release; knowing that it is a 1.0 release I DO NOT recommend this game. It still needs to be finished.This is a beautiful game to play or sit back and watch.I lost the first station to RNG about an hour in when my lab (the ONLY way to make money) was randomly removed from my ship in an ""event."" Immediate loss since getting up and running requires you to spend a lot of money, leaving you unable to pay the big bucks when you get punched with these events too early.My second playthrough I got to 5 astronauts and 2 labs with 150 O2, 3K Water, 2.5K Food and only losing ~25% total battery life at night. Then I specialized my second lab into tech (so I could unlock extra/large parts.) The only unlock that worked was for the large solar panel array. The other items stayed locked and doing research to unlock the other specializations actually locks those specializations so you can't use them.Those are what we gamers call GAME BREAKING BUGS.I understand wanting to make a difficult and realistic game; however, having early game stations which literally live paycheck to paycheck take full piece destruction like that is not possible without losing or keeping a ridiculously high rainy day fund in reserve.New users:Just to get a station running you need to build the following:A Lab - Your only way to bring in income.Batteries - Although not mentioned anywhere, if your station runs out of power at night, the shuttle will not launch to bring you supplies and crew. (Testing it showed that you cannot start without batteries, the shuttle will never leave with the crewman you need to man the lab.)Oxygen Generator - I found that spending the $1B off the bat for this instead of buying oxygen tanks saves you a lot of trouble. (Your crew will die between drops otherwise.)Water Tank - The Windows Generic Female Voice will not shut up about your fatal and depleting water levels (50L or base starting water levels BTW) until you buy a water tank.RCS Thrusters - A part that relies on guesswork since the stats are non-existent. This keeps your ship up. If you are constantly having the WGFV yell about altitude then you need more of these.Waste Disposal - Honestly, not sure how any of the waste is calclated but this prevents ecxess weight from forcing your station down faster.At this point your ship should be semi-stable. Upgrade some storage tanks, add some more solar arrays.Easiest way I found to accomplish anything was to stabilize a one crew ship then specialize a lab in Earth and Science and perform the lengthy but well-paying contracts.This game is not yet user friendly. Some contracts when undertaken restrict your labs from those specs instead of unlocking them. Further the new rooms don't seem to unlock at all. When repairing your ship, there is no cost estimate. If you hit repair it just starts draining money, leaving you without the ability to compair the price for repair against the price for replacement.---ALWAYS KEEP $1.5 BILLION AVAILABLE---At any point the game will take a module from you with one of its random events. If that module was your only lab and you are sitting on $400 Million, that is game over. You get to float for hours watching your money drain away."

Once you build a certain number of labs it becomes a click contracts game. There's definitley potential to the game but as of right now there's not much to it.

Sometimes the station flies through the dark side of the earth and the FPS significantly decreases(140 to 20). It would be more interesting if the station can be maneuvered to another orbit. More fun if the game has a mission/request list. Textures need improving, too. If you are a  fan of spaceflight, I recommend you to have one."

(read about correcting orbit mechanics which also can help to avoid debris or stabilize the station after being hit, etc.)I knew this when getting into it and love the esthetics and the peacefull building, but if looking for a new harder simulation game like banished in space or somesuch one might need to wait and see where this game heads before buying.Bought it on a sale and do like it, but it needs more on the game mechanics before it is really playable, for now a really easy sim with a nice view of earth while it cycles around.It has a ton of possibilities to be a very entertaining game later on when more developed, a unique own feel and good visuals so for now my own opinion is that it has potential in the future."

Meteor showers or moving the station due to space junk? At the moment its very calming and passive gameplay (not boring).

If you're not a space junky, then you might save your cash for when it's further along.Even with the limited complexity of the Early Access state, it took me two stations to max out the game's current potential, which consists of balancing basic crew needs (literally haveing a powered habitat module), very simple thermal control, then power, water and O2.  WIth the generic ""lab module"" in place, crewmen can ""work"" and make $ which allows the purchase of necessary staiton bits.The thrill ends when you have a few labs running 24/7, with crew assigned to all three shifts... and you've managed to purchase everything there is to be bought.It took me about an hour to get there, but it was a fun hour.Looking forward to the coming releases and of course 1.0.I HOPE that this game will allow one to go INSIDE the station at some point.  That would be fantatsic...  maybe Vive and Oculus support?"

Currently the game is in Very early access so Items are limited but it is in a playable state.Pros:Space Sim(need more of these)ManagementVery MellowCons:Can cause motion sickness for some people if you look at earth too long.Not Very realistic as it doesnt pass over standard launch sites on earth.Very little customization.Lack of information boxes when selecting items to build (so not much you can know when trying to build)Management bar at the bottom is lacking more detailed informationLack of a moonStation is hard to see when it is in the Dark(would make it so you can see the station just make it low light or that station sections light up as you hover over)Lack of seeing a modern shuttle instead of a 1960s shuttle.Lack of settings to adjust quality on stuff for older PCs not using a GTX980+What i would like to see:More Options in modules like a garden/bio, Science is nice, Observation, Water recylers, Air scrubbers.Less wireframe options as it doesnt fit with most extensions to a station but would be ok with it if you have an upgrade option.Hotkey to disable health options on all modules as seeing green health bars all the time is annoying.Better movement as i cannot get to some modules as they do not center when i click on them.Zoom feature.Slower planet rotation(even if it breaks reality(Would solve the motion sickness and other issues with hardware requirements))Summary:Stable Orbit is a diffrent but similar game with alot of potentala and while its doing itself good and i dont see any crashes there is a lack of missions or goals to complete.My Recommendation to the developer is to focus on the station at the moment and fix and impliment some changes and get some goals in place for people to work twords. Then focus on other things like earth and weather for additional effects. As station building is the goal you want to enable people to work on that and to make what they want.At this time i cannot Give it a recommendation because a various lack of features but it is something i would keep an eye on.For others if you want to just do some basic station building this game can do it.TheJallie"

Maybe keep it 1:1? With its current update, it doesn't take more than a couple of hours to ""get comfortable"". Once you realize all you have to do manage is power, heat, and consumables, it's just a matter of making additions to your space station. After the game starts getting closer to the more realistic side of things through updates, there just needs to be more module additions, and maybe some kind of story line with goals to achieve.As is, it's a great foundation to continue further development. With the next update release, Perihelion, scheduled to be released in late April, I am genuinely excited for what the developer has to bring to the table for all the early adopters.
