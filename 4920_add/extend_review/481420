The reason I bring that up is you will find a lot of the same tricks\modes of the original Final Approach. Stuff like Bird Clearing, queing planes for takeoff, fire duty.But the real core of this game is all about flying. The first ouple campaign/tutorial levels will seem awfully familiar to FA owners. But this is saved by how cool flying is. Even from 3rd person its really great to be controlling this 3d model, and it deals with aero dynamics pretty well, so don't start a straight down dive figuring you can pull up at the last second, you will die.Same goes for slowing down too much . I was reaching for a ballon on a really steep climb in plane not designed for that and the engine started to stall .  Just stuff like that makes it a completely new dimension to the game.Its one of the best put togather VR games around right now. If I was a rift owner I'd buy this for sure,  I ended up playing about 40 mins on my first go and the time just flew by, the only reason I quit was I had caused  a two 747 looking planes to collide/explode on the runway at that big airport where it's all airlines.  Otherwise I'd probably still be playing/For Vive owners it really is best to think of this as  just anoher part of a whole larger game, say Final Approach: Definative Edition.Over  I'd say I still like the room scale version a bit more. but this isn't half bad and well worth the time"

I finally got FA: Pilot Edition so I'll have both versions.  I've just played Pilot Edition so far.  It's fun and very pretty.  It's got that ""I just want to land a few more planes before I turn it off feel"".Definitely a really good VR game.  Now I want to go play with the original standing HTC Vive version.Pay attention to ""controller support"" part--it really does want a game controller (my PS4 one worked fine through USB). There are many different kinds of planes, plus helicopters.(My only complaint is that it's challenging to try to stay lined up with the planes as I land.  As a result I get a just a tiny bit of motion sickness there--nothing that forced me to stop and I'm pretty sensitve to that kind of thing.)"

It's such a great perspective to play an already great game. I can't wait to finish this mode. Very great job team. Can't wait to see what else you come up with.

Wrote this reviewThis game is unplayable . The biggest issue being that the camera doesnt track with the plane... I dont know whats going on with that. But you press the bumper and it will put your view behind the pkane again, but as soon as you turn, the camera stop tracking..This game got me crazy dizzy. I think the only other game to get me feeling ill was Minecraft on Occulus VR"
76561197970866188,Recommended,481420,23770098,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,The Maddog,"Long story short, this is Final Approach: The ""Seated Controller Edition""  (aka any VR user without tracked motion controllers). It's basically the original game remade for a seated / xbox controller experiance (or at this point in time, the Oculus Rift). I much preffer the roomscale version but this version is just as engaging and just as much fun to play.  Since you currently get both versions for the price of one, you lose nothing and gain everything. Since I already highly recommened the original Final Approach I'll just jump to the pro's and cons of this version since whilst they are the same game storywise, gameplay differs a lot.Pros:  Acctually piloting the planes and choppers makes for fun gameplay. Very diffrent to simply drawing out a guideline and in some respects more fun,Cons: Losing the motion controllers detracts in certain elements and is a lot less fun, especially when you go down into the gameworld to perform certain tasks. There's also the the whole camera tracking / VR sickness thing. I seem pretty imune to it but certain elements could induce it, expecially when piloting plans in a 3rd person perspective. Would have been better to acctually pilot directly from the pilots seat but I can see why the devs didnt do this (the original was never designed that way).Overall though it's  still big recommendation from me. 2 games for the price of one, not everyone gets VR sickness (and if you do, just wait for your motion controllers and play the alternate version). It's win win for us gamers and we all get to pick and choose which version works best for us.Big thanks to the devs just for throwing out this non roomscale version at no extra cost. Here's to Phaser Lock and all the keep doing in VR."
,Recommended,481420,32960636,Posted: 28 June,all,Rafport,"Seeing other reviews I see I'm an exception, but honestly I liked the Pilot Edition more than the standard one. I bought Final Approach just when launched, at the very early days of Vive avaliability, and yes it was cool but wasn't very impressed of the gameplay itself. The game suffered also of awful performances with lot of missed frames, and I refunded.I'm back today after more than a year, with the Pilot Edition (than include also the standard, if you buy this one you'll get both). I tried the classic version again, the graphics is way more detailed and super smooth, they made an exceptional work in optimizations but still I don't find particulary fun or compelling the gameplay. With my surprise, the Pilot Edition instead fit way more my taste.Where those games are almost identical in contents, the classic version use full roomscale, handtracking and is based on drawing paths in the air: let's say than is closer to play with toys on a tabletop airport. The Pilot Edition instead is a seated + pad experience, something less interesting in theory, but well... now you pilot airplanes with a sweet third person view! It's like a Pilotwings kind of game mixed with managerial elements. Birds and fires are still present, but their weight is reduced, and this also is a good news being both actions repetitive and annoying to perform.I realize than the classical Final Approach was (and still is) a more peculiar and roomscale oriented project, but the Pilot Edition as pure videogame is a better product."

If I had bought it for the asked price of 23€ o_O, I'd just ask for a refund.This whole thing has just quickly been made to serve the Rift users with their Xbox controllers...Had the game installed for a while now, but never launched it, I knew from the beginning I wasn't going to like it...I wonder if mouse&keyboard is possible, perhaps going to try it one day."
76561198021899277,Recommended,481420,23824475,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Mad Dog Biff,On level 5 at the time of writing this. Just to say it's a lot of fun in this mode. Just as chaotic and a bit harder as doing stuff takes longer. Personally I am enjoying it as much as roomscale but it does make some people a little dizzy. I get just a touch of that but not enough to make me ill. You need to hit the left bumper as the plane turns so you can stay behind it and pull back on the left joystick to slow it down. I think they have done a great job. Cockpit mode would be good but not essential.
,Recommended,481420,25904944,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,SKΛTΞºʳÐ¡Ξ☠  [222],You will WANT to use an Xbox controller for this.  A flight stick crossed my mind but I'm not sure if that's possible.I played a good amount of Final Approach.  I liked it.Then I tried Pilot Edition.  WHOA I love this.I asked my G/F if she's ever played any flight games (like HAWX) and she said NO.  (only flying in GTA)  So she tried Pilot Edition.  She crashed her planes... alot.  But she stuck with it!  Now she reeeally likes this game.HIGHLY recommended.

You sit and use a controller instead.  Not that its a bad thing but, FOR ME, VR sickness slowly creeps in because of it.  The developer has done what they can to mitigate the issue and in small doses the experience is fun.For those unfortunate enough to be experiencing VR with a Rift and control pad this a purchase you should be consider.  When and if you buy the Touch controllers you'll be able to experience the game as it was originally developed if they are supported down the line."
,Recommended,481420,24305206,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,Peter Burling,I had hoped the view was more first person but this is still a bit of fun if you want a sit down. Slower pace of play to the stand up room scale game.

,Not Recommended,481420,23855318,"Posted: 27 June, 2016",all,Foxysaux,"Not for the weak of stomach... My first time flying ended disasterously, plane after plane would get lost or crash in any attempt to even land would end in fiery death, that is if I could even find where the runway was. I found it jarring that any time I wanted to steer, the plane would fly out of my view, the camera does not follow, and the only way to adjust the plane back into view was to hit the left bumper of my controller. Suffice to say that any turn was nearly impossible to follow and that hitting the bumper only made me confused as to what new direction I was heading, ( some sort of indicator hud as to where the landing zones are would have been greatly helpful in that situation). At this point it was unplayable as I could not even get past the tutorial level... However on my second attempt I found out the much needed accessory that was crucial to playing this game, a swivel chair! Yes, rotating my physical view allowed me to keep the plane in sight while it turned. So simple and yet completely flew right over my head. Once discovering that little tid-bit I got quite good at handling the plane, putting out fires, and tending to the seagulls. However...I was ill-prepared for the nasuea I would feel. Slowly but surely it ate away at my tolerance level (which to be fair isn't that high) until I had to just close my eyes and take off the headset. For those gifted with iron inner-ears(?) this is a pretty fun version of the roomscale one, but I cannot personally recommend it."

It is a huge improvement compared to basic version of final approach in terms of playability and keeping interest going on. I love the way I can fly the planes, jets and helicopters as if I was flying RC planes, but much more cooler way and in fabulous miniature world! It is quite easy to learn to fly the planes, but all little tasks with the planes and at field keeps interest on. One of my favorite games on VR.The only downside for this game is slight motion sickness which I develop especially at city airport due to jerkiness, but that is most likely due to my -not-performing-enough-graphics-gard.

The game was originally the ""still standing"" version where you draw lines with your touch controller. Now, people who wanted to actually fly them things (and have actual VR legs) got the awesome ""Pilot Edition"" for free, and all the others complain and downvote this game. Guys, that's life. If you get sick, play the standard edition. Don't downvote for free addons that you don't like. You are teaching game developers here the very wrong story. They will nerf their stuff even further, if they learn they will get downvoted for ""non comfort""-features.As a real tip: Don't sit at a table. Take your (hopefully) wireless controller and a rotating chair, and follow the planes by turning the chair. Nausea gone.No to my review: I bought this game at the '17 summer sale for 3,74€, and for that price it's an awesome fun to play. For the full price (currently 14,99€) maybe I wouldn't recommend it, not sure. But, considering the fact that you get two different versions (the norrmal edition, where you draw paths for the airplanes with your touch controller, and the more awesome Pilot Edition, where you fly with your game controller), it shouldn't be too expensive then either.The game gives you a ""toy version"" of airfields, where you move around, start and land airplanes. There are some mini-games and some dogfighting against UFOs. It's great fun for some hours, and I like the toy-like plastic look and the variety of planes.If you get it on sale, it's a must have. For the full price, still not bad if you like this kind of games."

The camera thing is a bit wierd but it's not that bad once you get used to how it works. I really enjoyed playing the game with this controller setup. A whole new twist on the game! I would have preferred if there weren't 2 different versions but instead a single version with the option of switching between the two at the beginning menu, as now I have to play it all over again when I'd rather just jump ahead to some of the more interesting missions. Still great regardless. [HTC vive review, with PS4 controller]"
