And if you lose those items you have to go back easier levels and grind money. It really makes you wanna give up instead of continue. Otherwise, it's a great game. Lupin Approves!EDIT: After unlocking gas station things started to get better. You can easily get enough money to buy back those items that you lost. Don't give up hope!"
,Recommended,481870,32116376,Posted: 1 June,all,Dark_Assassin91,"In this game you will assume the role of a thief that is behind on his rent and resorts to doing what he does best; whilst doing this you will be able to purchase equipment to help advance with each level but be warned that if you get caught, you could lose all of your equipment.I had a great deal of fun with this game and whilst it might not be a long game, one level in particular had me stuck for at least a couple of hours. There are a total of 12 stages that need to be completed 3 times each in order to progress to the next stage. As you can imagine the final round of each stage is the hardest and my prediction is that  stage 11 round 3 (The one that took me the most time) will most likely be the one that determines if you will finish the game or not.There are some fun Easter eggs, the story is not great but the gameplay makes up for it. Also when you finish the Story; there are options for level creation which I only looked at briefly but it seems like it could work well. Also there is an experimental multiplayer mode but there was no one else online when I tried hosting a session.With all that in mind I definitely recommend this game if you are a fan of retro gaming styles, are the kind of player that likes playing stealth games or if you are just looking for a cheap, relatively short but fun game to play between (or perhaps as a break during) big AAA titles or life consuming RPG's."

Without sneaking, when you start out you just have to run around as fast as possible and get everything before they come back, sneaking doesn't make a difference it just makes you slower.To progress you also need items, you need something to cut wires and make dogs busy, but if you get caught you lose all items and all of your money that you had from other places, how does he carry the money around and why? No one knows.About getting caught, what could you do once you get caught? you might ask, well you place decoys that will get punched out of existance and will make the guy forget about you but only when you go out of sight while he is busy killing the decoy - and if you are being chased by a dog just throw some meat and the dog will be bribed.My english is worse then the firecracker useless."

You basicly have to go to each house/building, stealing goods, finding the key, find the safe, open it, get the treasure, and escape through a window. It's simple but really fun. I'm gonna keep playing this game While I wait for The Very Organized Thief to come out.Pros: The gameplay is fun and addictive, has a lot of levels for it's current state, and the game gets harder the farther you get. It's good/bad, and you'll see why.Cons: It gets a little too difficult the farther you go. You have to be lucky to find the key in the beginning of the house/building so you can have enough time to explore, collect goods, and find the safe before the owner arrives. If you don't find it in the beggining, you're most probably screwed because once you find the key, the owner will arrive. Forcing you to find the safe while the owner is walking around his house, get the treasure and hope that you can get to the exit without him spotting you.That's all the cons I can think of...Overall I think it's a really fun stealth game and I think you should give it a try.So I think I'll give Mini Thief a 4/5."

And in early access? This game is my favorite at the moment!Please don't listen to the bad reviews complaining about losing items, if you kept everything even after being busted what would be the point or the challenge!?!?Sometimes I have fun trying to loot and escape with no items navigating houses while setting off multiple alarms. This game is fanastic some bugs still, more so it seems in the multiplayer. But again it's in early access so you are warned. Right now I am up to the City Bank. A hefty amount of levels for early access, I would be content if this was the cap. But I know we'll probably see more. Already well worth the money!!Great graphics, great amount of items, good soundtrack! Only thing again is that multiplayer, my controls don't work for keyboard.

,Not Recommended,481870,23558147,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,ClothTiger,"tl;dr: utterly useless.- Grind grind grind the same level until you can get a safe to put stuff in. Otherwise you lose it all, because for some reason it makes sense to the developer that a thief would keep everything he's stolen on his person instead of leaving it at home, a warehouse, under his mom's bed. How about the cops take what's on you and say a random % of your other stuff, because you didn't have time to stash it in a safe place yet. Think of something! Just having the player lose everything is incredibly lazy, as if the developer just couldn't be bothered putting his thinking cap on. Better to just get the game out there faster, I guess.- It doesn't tell you how much money you have unless you enter the pawn shop. Would it kill you to put it on the screen next to your tools or something? There's so much useless dead space on the screen; put some info there.- What do the creak noises and trip wires do? It doesn't seem like they do anything, on the first levels at least. At first I thought at least the trip wires made the owner come home faster, but it seems you have pretty much the same time to finish a level no matter what you do.- It doesn't tell you what traps/stuff are coming up in the next level. That makes sense in theory, but not when (as far as I could see) you can't just leave through the front door (the same frickin' way I assume you came in) once you've started the level.On level 3, with the dog: if you can't escape through another room than the kitchen, where the dog is, and you don't have a way to distract the dog...How are you getting out of there?- Often hard to search stuff, you have to stand on a very specific spot. Even tho the game tells you you can search there.- Stupid progression system.Having to crack a safe to progress to the next level makes...no sense. Is there a secret map to the next house in there or something? How about a super simple story where you've joined a gang and doing tryouts for them. Or something. Anything.- Zero story. Who am I? Why am doing this? The only thing you're told is that you're broke and decides to go out and rob the same house every day for a year, because the owner apparently isn't smart enough to hide his safe key in another place than one of his 10 drawers.- The bathroom door is locked from the outside.It's possible that some of my concerns are alleviated as the ""story"" progresses, but I have zero interest in finding out. And the game doesn't bother telling me anything.+ It's marginally more entertaining than watching paint dry.Yeah yeah yeah, it's EA, bla bla bla. Doesn't make what I've said any less true. And from I've gathered, this is pretty much what the finished game will look like. Just some more levels and pointless achivements."

A few suggestions I have are to make the levels different. So make different apartment levels instead of reskinning the one level, and make the different levels appear randomly. Make a way to break the line of sight. Add some more interaction with levels. Add a skill tree that maybe affects how good you are at sneaking/lockpicking/searching. Maybe if you have a low searching level searching for valuables makes a lot of noise. Create a mechanic so players can throw items they bought from the pawn shop or just items from around the map to distract the guards/owners. Maybe make the penalty for gettting caught less serious. These are just some stupid suggestions I am throwing out there. I honestly don't have many bad things to say about the game except for the repetitiveness."

,Recommended,481870,31263552,Posted: 20 April,all,ShadowclawX2,"This is a very good game with a lot of levels, although one thing I wish that the game didn't do is taking away all of your money and items when you lose. Even with the insurance item, it is still very hard for some levels to die less than twice, and it is very tedious to get all of the items that I had back. Plus, your money gets taken away, even with the insurance item, making it even more unnecesarrily difficult to progress throughout the game."

A really nice stealth game. Obviously there are some bugs but this is early release, that's what you're going to get. One down side is that you need to keep repeating the same levels to earn cash to buy the safe, or all your objects and cash go. So if you're in the middle of saving up for the safe and you get caught, you have to start over. Hope they re-think that aspect. But other than that, really cool, can't wait for the multiplayer.

You lose everything when you get busted, so each break in is more stressful and tense than the last.  Mechanics are solid and the different locations make you rethink your strategy.  I case the place on the first run and duck out as soon as the owner gets home, make a plan, and go back equipped and clean him out.Owners are kinda stupid, but the game is pretty hard as it is so maybe smarter owners isn't what I really want.Good stuff - reccomended."

First, some of my gripes:The tutorial was a bit confusing, but did convey enough information to get started. The unskippable ""better go rob someone"" text got really annoying really quickly.I feel like the most effective way to play the game is not the most enjoyable, which seems like a design flaw. The early levels get you money fairly quickly and easily, so it seems like you just farm the early levels for cash until you can buy all the items you need to complete a later level. And you repeat this until you memorize the later levels, and can farm them as well.As criticisms go, though, these are pretty minor. It's actually a quite cute and fun premise, and I enjoyed learning the house layouts and getting the upgrades to rob bigger and better houses."

My complaint is that if you get caught, you lose everything except your level progress. True, you can buy ""insurance"" for your items, but I don't feel like paying more for insurance than the items cost. It is really annoying to build up money and buy gear for a level that I still don't know if I will fail or pass. I have stopped playing this game because it is no longer fun for me.

Sadly, as of now, the game is really frustrating.Basically, I got past both of the house levels no problem. Suddenly, the third level throws a nearly vertical difficulty spike with the dog. I wasn't prepared; I didn't buy the rubber steak. I try to go about my business, but before is could even take one step into any room or set of stairs, the dog just runs up to me with its night vision and does not shut up. It chases me down and won't leave me alone. I try to lose it in one of the rooms by shutting the door behind me but THE DOG SOMEHOW OPENS THE DOOR! I was screwed, When I hide, the dog camps out in front of the thing I'm hiding in and won't stop barking. I got caught and lost ALL MY MONEY AND ITEMS TO A DOG. Sadly, the level seems impossible without items...All in all, this game COULD be great. It could definitely use some improvements in the maps and in difficulty. If you want me to be more specific, my idea is to test the game without items. If you lose the items, then you should still be able to complete the level. The items should be able to make the game a little easier and allow you to reach areas that hide extra loot. I also feel that the dog is too big of an obsticle to put at the beginning of the game.One more time, I believe that this game could be great. It just needs some good tweaks and BOOM a game I could easily recommend to others who want a good stealth game when they don't want to spend too much."

,Recommended,481870,25611611,"Posted: 20 September, 2016",all,Bonesinger,"Now that I got a proper chance to play, I can say this is an interesting game. You get into a house, steal stuff and get out. Seems simple, until the owner comes home. After each succesful robbery, the house gets more security, but not neccesarily more rewards or things of value.Having to equip and using the 'use item' button to disable a house's lights and laser sensors doesn't make much sense to me, but I guess you could say it brings some immersion, since a burglar would have to stop and grab his tools.A visual glitch I encountered made the character stay one layer under most objects, like drawers and doors."
