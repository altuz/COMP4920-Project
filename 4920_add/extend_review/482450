All the mechanics feel solid, the controls are pretty intuitive, and it's hype as hell.It's easy to make up combos, come up with gimmicks, and adapt to whatever your opponent is throwing at you. Honestly this game is just well put together and a joy to play.I can't vouch for any of the singleplayer content or the netcode as I've only played local versus mode.

,Recommended,482450,28259549,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,SubrosianChainsawMassacre_|BC|,"When I was spending a year away from my regular school at my local community college, I always hung out in a room on campus where there were guys playing YuGiOh, Vanguard, emulators via a Nintendo Wii, and one guy always playing various fighting games.There were 3 I remember the most, Tekken 6, BlazBlue (Don't remember which one though), and this game. I played it with him a few times, liked what I saw, but I couldn't get my hands on it, lack of a Playstation to put the disc into and all that. So, when I woke up to see that this game got released on steam and I had a coupon given to me because of some cross-promotion with Skullgirls (another phenomenal fighter), I spent little time adding the money to my steam wallet to pick this one up.We've got a fun roster of colorful characters from various Nitro+ series, but I only immediately recognized 3 of them. Saber from Fate/Zero, Super Sonico because I spend too much time in the gutters of the internet, and Saya, who I am amused is in a game on steam considering the content of her native game. Everyone else is a mystery to me, and while that is a turn off for plenty of people (games like Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Melty Blood have the same issue), the fighting is so good that I don't think it matters.The fighting in this game is some of the best I've experienced, with silky smooth controls, a lot of opportunities for mix-ups, recovering is surprisingly easy to accomplish compared to most fighters I've played, and solid mechanics. You can call in one of your two chosen assist characters with the simple push of a button (which I assume depends on the controller), you can activate this sort of cancel that refills some of your health and rapidly increases your special gague, there's even a dodge of sorts, something that you don't see too often in fighting games.The online even works really well, assuming your opponent has a good signal. I played a few matches against 2 or 3 opponents with a good signal, and I had virtually no input lag, minimal slowdown, and barely any freezes, and I'm stuck on dorm wifi at the time of writing.The keyboard controls are mostly customizable, you can change everything except for the movement keys (ASDW for player 1, arrow keys for player 2). Controller compatability is there (as it should be), but I have no idea how many controllers are compatible. I have a 360 controller and it works perfectly (well, as perfectly as it can since the controller is not conducive to fighters), so those options are there.There is a big flaw however, and its one that will drive away anyone who isn't a fighting game enthusiast. This game is not beginner friendly. There are no tutorials of any kind to help you learn how each character plays so you can figure out which one fits you best. Video tutorials exist, but most people aren't going to look those up. So if you're considering buying this, just note that figuring out who you're good at is a crapshoot unless you look up external sources.Other than that though, this is a solid fighting game and another wonderful addition to my collection.Moe meat girl forever!"
,Recommended,482450,28309202,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,AbundantChoice,"Nitroplus Blasterz is way, way more accessible than I expected it to be, and a lot of fun to pick up and play. Maybe my limited time with Guilty Gear and BlazBlue set up the assumption that ""anime fighters are fun to watch, but have 500 different interlocking complex systems that make them utterly unplayable casually"", but Blasterz seems... pretty straightforward? The core systems and commands seem pretty easy to wrap your head around, and It ""looks"" cool enough even early on that it's fun to play even if you're not dropping ultra-tourney level ""tech"".The commands are the usual fireball and dragon punch motions and pretty common across characters, and there's only one charge meter to keep track of and it tends to work the same for everyone (powered up specials take up 1 out of 3 bar chunks, a dial-a-combo chain attack thingy for 2 chunks, or your ultra-mega-super-super for 3 chunks). You've got light/medium/heavy attacks like most fighting games, then a ""guard"" button for evasion and combo-breaking, and a ""super heavy"" button for pushing around and crushing through guard. You can whip out a ""break out of any combo"" thing once a round, and enter a fire-up mode as well that builds meter along with some other stuff as well. It's all... pretty easy to come to grips with?While there's not that many characters, getting to pick 2 support characters adds some fun variety to things (a lot of them just seem like extra attacks at different ranges or heights, but others do wacky stuff like pop out powerups, or fill your meter). At least the game gives you a few ""recommended"" supports for each char too, which is nice.I dunno, maybe it's just that i'm coming off the initial ""oh god, this is impenetrable"" impression from the last BlazBlue, or the new Street Fighter 5's disastrous launch of ""we're going to introduce a bunch of new systems, but not actually teach you anything about any of them, or how to even use them"", Blasterz seems refreshingly straightforward. It's just a lot of fun to play, even at a pretty casual level."

Has a little bit of everything in terms of mechanics: parrying, rolling/dodging, short hopping, chain/linking, supers, bursts and assist cancels. Feels like a variation of Marvel Vs Capcom with a dash of Guilty Gear. Here are my pros and cons:Pros:+Good quality graphics. Detailed sprites and artwork.+Music is fairly catchy.+Extensive combo system with lots of variation+Huge variety of assist characters+Solid online netplay. Had many good experiences with matches overall as long as connection is 2 bars or more.+Good initial port to PC. Very minimal problems.+Fairly easy to pick up but difficult to master.+ All DLC included: Homura + Heart characters and bikini costume packs. $20 price tag with 35% discount if you own Skullgirls and buy within the first week of sale is a very fair price.Cons:-Small roster of 14 characters.-No option to pick character music. 2nd player is always the chosen theme.-Not a true definitive port. Missing intro videos from arcade and console versions.Overall, this game is a solid addition to a fighting library. I highly recommend it."
,Recommended,482450,28265230,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,Tatsuhoshi,"As much as I love games like this, they are, as always, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in the final boss battle and very unfriendly to anyone with any sort of handicap.This game is full of great graphics and some of Nitroplus' more obscure characters, which is a treat if you know who they are and where they came from.  The dialogue between characters is humorous and enjoyable for the most part, but if you aren't familiar with N+'s earlier works you may find yourself frequently confused by the references made.After spending an hour and a half on the final boss battle alone with only one win and no victories, I'll probably never touch the story mode again unless I absolutely have to.  Aside from being incredibly painful as someone with nerve damage in my hands, it's just not fun to go up against a boss who does significantly more damage than you do, can teleport out of attacks and has a ridiculous number of invulnerability frames compared to the characters you start with.  While victory would probably be possible, and possibly even easy for someone without this handicap, it's a just about impossible hurdle for me to cross, as most of these sorts of games are.Pros:  Good gameplay, smooth animation, excellent graphics, fast-paced, fun and amusing story, great for pvp or one-on-one battles against the AICons:  Same as almost every other 2d, side-scrolling fighter out there.  It doesn't really offer anything new as far as gameplay goes, and the end boss is the usual:  a character that can throw combos out like they are going out of style because it doesn't have to input the commands into a controller of some kind, so story mode, which is where you get to experience the dialogue in the game, is just a wholly unpleasant experience for me.In Conclusion:  This game is still fun and I did enjoy seeing a number of N+'s lesser known characters getting the spotlight, I can enjoyed the story up until the final battle where I hit a complete brick wall.  It is important for me to note that most players will probably not have as much trouble as I did, but as a handicapped gamer, this is an obstacle I will probably not every be able to beat.  I may ask a friend to help with those just so I can see the stories to completion and unlock stuff if there's anything to be unlocked."

Some you will recognize, some you'll swear you recognize but can't quite recall etc.Where it shines is the supports. LOTS of support characters, and they have lot of different abillites. Some pretty basic like ""shoot the thing"", and some that include an entire band popping up and playing an entire song whilst handing out buffs in the form of music notes. Oh and did I mention a lot of these supports can help/harm both you and your opponent? Add to that the fact that you select two of them to take with you into fights and you have one really nice system.Characters themselves however are a bit lacking in the moves department (no book long move lists here) but have just enough to be unique whilst still being polished at the same time.In summery: This game isn't GREAT. But it is good. Remarkably so. And definately worth a shot for both fighting game fenatics or just regular old otaku interested in seeing who has the best waifu.100% would recommend."

,Recommended,482450,28463874,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,Ally,"SummaryGraphics:7/10 - stellar effort, great anime sprites, some disappointing arena's stop it being higher.Sound:7/10 - Great soundtrack, good voicing(Japanese voicing as a warning), some annoying character noises but overall solid.Gameplay:10/10 - I bloody loved the gameplay, the transition from a straight up story mode beat 'em up to a VN was such a great idea. The fighting mechanics were great as well! Which surprised me!Story:10/10 - Going out on a limb here and saying that this story, whilst being nothing spectacular, is a 10/10 because for a fighting game, its genuinely had a lot of love and attention. Not to mention a whole host of familiar anime characters thrown in the mix.Overall:8/10 - Honestly, its a very good fighter, albeit not on SFIV's level but certainly better than most other top notch fighters. Add to that a cast of highly likeable anime characters and you've got yourself a hit. Personally the idea of doing Saber's ""EXCALIBUR!"" attack sold the game to me alone.Full ReviewFirst of all, if you don't like anime, there's probably other fighters you should check out. Street Fighter IV is perhaps the best fighter ever made, I'd check that out. That being said, if you don't dislike anime and like fighters, this is actually pretty good. It's got surprising depth for what could have been a simple anime cash in.The difficulty curve is steep, just hitting combo's can be tough and the final boss ramps up the difficulty tenfold. That being said its not impossible. It didn't take me long before I had Saber rip the boss a new one. The playable characters are all taken from the popular back catalogue that the company has, including FATE: Stay/Night, Psycho-Pass, Sonico, Demonbane, Arcane Heart and many more. So once you finish the main ""story"" you are treated to a new 2 hours or so VN including a lot of these characters set in the Demonbane series universe. This is a great addition and shows the devs know their demographic!The graphics are great just to see people like Saber or Akane(psychopass) on steam. However they let themselves down slightly with some poor arena's to play in. Looking at your waifu and fighting with amazingly animated and importantly, WELL FRAMED characters is brilliant. Their ""ultimate"" attacks are treated with an anime CG which is beautiful. However the backgrounds are a bit limp and generic, whats more there are only 10 separate ones. Its a shame the same love for the heroines was not given to the background, as otherwise the stellar animation and graphics would be given a 10/10. If you can ignore or like the limited arena's, the graphics are great. As I said, importantly there are a lot of frames, which for a fighter can lead to very good multiplayer play!The sound was great without excelling. Good voicing which you'd expect really, but in Japanese if that bothers you, all text obviously in native language. The music was amazing, I loved it. Sometimes characters getting hit caused odd noises on certain characters which detracted somewhat from the sounds score. But overall, I'd probably buy the soundtrack, its very good!Quick unrelated positive note for the devs, as an achievement hunter, all the achievements are through ""offline"" play. I can not thank the devs enough for this design choice, it means the game will always be 100%'able even long after the servers get killed or the community dies. On that note, I managed to find full lobies every search so far as of the 19th of December 2016.Overall I'd buy this game. Its better than Street Fighter V and most other current fighter alternatives, whilst giving anime fans a chunk of amazing characters to love and enjoy!"

,Recommended,482450,28342680,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,Rafael M.,"Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel is a welcome surprise for anyone who loves Japanese games and fighting games in general. Developed by EXAMU, the creator of the series Arcana Heart, and distributed by XSEED Games and Marvelous USA, this game can excel in the genre even having characters not well known in the West and being a bit more niche than the subgenre air dasher, which by itself is already part of a select niche.With the inclusion of all the DLCs of the console version, new colors for the characters, scenarios with animated backgrounds, new poses of victory and rebalanced gameplay, the PC version of Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel certainly is the definitive edition.The game manages to surprise right away, with its very well designed sprites, great amount of animation frames, exciting soundtrack and a narrator that reminiscent of the narrator of Pocket Fighter, which gives a cheerful mood to the game. The execution of the basic moves is easy and if at first glance there seems to be a small variety of movements, the impression soon dissolves, as this is a game that rewards players who are willing to discover secret moves that aren't on the commands list.Even though it's considered an air dasher, the range of air strikes is moderate if we compare it with Skullgirls and the series Arcana Heart and Marvel vs. Capcom. But when it comes to fun, this game entertains as much as the previous games cited.Pros* Fun game, chaotic (in a good way) and with a cheerful mood* Fighting system that encourages players to be creative* Online mode that allows filtering connection types (ping) to avoid lag* Each fighter is quite different and there are no clone characters* Remaping options for keyboard and controller* Definitive edition of the game, with more content for less priceCons* A small variety of scenarios (only 10)* Lack of tutorial and / or challenge mode of combos, to help learning the mechanics and combos* Impossibility to choose the music played. So if you only play with a character in versus mode, the song will always be the same."
,Recommended,482450,28386220,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,AssassinGlasgow,"If you have either a background in anime or in visual novels then this game will probably be up your alley. It's the ultimate waifu beat em' up featuring a cast of memorable characters and support characters, like Saber from Fate. The game is visually fantastic with good sprites and animated cinematics, as well as great overall music and background. There is a story, but it feels more like an after thought as a reason for why all these heroines would be fighting each other in the first place.And honestly, nothing amuses me more than Saya from Saya no Uta being in here, That is hilarious. It's even more hilarious when you have Saber fight against her since this Saber is the Fate/zero version (and those who have seen the series will understand what I mean by this). I pretty much picked up this series because it had a bunch of Urobuchi's writing in here, but the game is actually pretty good!It's a nice fighter in general that's fast paced and flashy, and as a port it's pretty good on PC. The only downside to this is that trying to pull off specific moves is difficult. I was using a controller, but even then I had trouble performing the moves I wanted when in an actual fight and not in training. This on top of a stupidly spammy boss that can KO you in a few seconds is pretty annoying. Fight stick is definitely recommended. I don't even know how this game functions on keyboard, and I'm scared to find out honestly lol.Definitely recommended when it's on sale and if you're a fan of either Nitroplus stuff or anime 2d fighters in general.

Thus, you will encounter some mechanics from similar games such as air-dashes, a focus on long and flashy combos, burst and roman cancel systems, etc.Like other fighters of this subgenre, normals are split into three buttons: A, B, and C, representing Light, Medium, and Heavy attacks.  This game also include additional buttons D and E for even slower and stronger normals, as well as a universal dash-cancelling system.The game has a visual novel styled story mode.  The roles of the characters are presented such that knowledge of their original source isn't needed too much.The sound effects are decent, and the music is pretty dang awesome.  Every character has their own theme that plays during fights.  You will generally hear the theme for player 2's character, like it or not.Command buffering is VERY lenient.  I'd honestly say this is one of the easiest fighting games to get into thanks to the buffer, as it helps to learn basic combos when you first start out.  That said, there's still a lot of depth with its various systems such as the dash cancelling and assist systems.Unfortuantely, the AI is mostly a joke.  I can easily breeze through fights against them without much problem.As per usual fighting game tradition, the final boss of arcade mode is a cheater.  One can easily dominate against the last boss with proper knowledge of their character and the game mechanics, but making a single mistake can be very punishing.Online is unfortunately not that active, but one can set up matches within the community discord.My only gripe with this game is that the keyboard remapping could be improved.  P1 is locked into using WASD and P2 is locked into using the arrow keys for movement.  There's no way to switch them.  Additionally, P2 cannot remap their buttons to any of the WASD keys, so if you're used to using those keys.  You will need to use an external program to use them for attacks.."

Simple mechanics, very high damage, plentiful resources, and a colorful, varied cast gives the game a very fast and exciting pace. While it's lacking a bit in the tutorial department, there's plenty of resources on the mizuumi wiki, youtube, and the training room for even a novice like me to sink my teeth in. After seeing it but never really playing it in my local arcade, I decided to give it a shot.So why the negative review?Simple answer: It's not worth the current asking price of 30 USD. It feels more like a 15 dollar purchase or less.This game costs as much as Blazblue Chronophantasma right now and offers very little content for the casual player with a fraction of Blazblue's competitive playerbase.There's 2 story/arcade campaigns, a score attack, traditional netplay, VS, and training room. That's it. No challenge mode, no unlockable super characters, nothing. The AI in this game is ok but you're not gonna get much longevity out of it. That leaves you with network mode which is about what you'd expect for a poverty anime fighter. This isn't Blazblue where you can find a dozen matches on discord in 5 min. or so; it's gonna take some time.While Nitropluz Blasterz's strong points lie in it's accessibility, there's honestly not enough depth in the combat to justify such a whopping asking price. There's nothing fancy here, it's very much by the numbers. You get a ""blast"" which is essentially a burst+super mode. The combo system goes from light, medium, heavy, into progressively stronger supers with little varation aside from assists and blast cancel. There's not much innovation which makes this very much feel like a simpler Mahvel: Anime Edition. Sure, you get a guard break move and a dedicated defense button but those feel like quality of life additions rather than meaningful contributions.If the price ever falls or you actually recognize a majority of the cast, feel free to buy it as it's quite fun at the end of the day. Just not 30 dollars worth of fun.As a side note, you're probably wondering where the hell do some of these characters come from?wiki.mizuumi.nethas most of the citations on these characters. Here's a few:- hammer girl was in some gothic fighting game- pistol girl was in some PS2 visual novel- cross girl used to be in the company mascot role that Sonico is in?- ""Dragon"" was in some eroge about ""a boy-meets-girl story in a world under attack by dragons"""

Mainly due to the lack of content. It also lacks players, which is personally a bad thing on a fighting game. Not even in Ranked match I could find a single opponent. Online play is the main reason why I buy a fighting game nowadays. And lacking players definitely lowers my thoughts of it.Overall rating: 7.5/10I'm giving the game a positive review.

(nothing a trip to the Task Manager won't fix, but do bare that in mind)Great 2D fighter, and a great VN mash up game.The Story isn't particularly great, storyline wise (surprising, being released by a VN studio).Another Story, on the other hand, is much better writtenEspecially if you're a Lovecraftian horror fanif you're interested in the VN side of things.In it's defense, although having a better story for each character wouldn't have been an enormous feat, this is primarily a fighting game (Another Story being its VN counterpart, in which you even have the option of skipping the playable fights entirely).If you're into VN, you should recognise a few of the characters.As far as the fighting goes, it's pretty stock standard for the genre (no breaking from the status quo on this one, you get exactly what you pay for.Now, onto the personal opinion portion of this review:1. If you're going to do a VN Mugen, you need a bigger roster. Even with a small roster, you kinda need Nep-Nep.I'll settle for Soni Ami, but this kinda needed Nep-Nep...2. Would have been nice to have had an english dub, for the ingame dialogue, but ""meh"".3. I will never understand why everything VN related costs so much more than its western counterpart...Oh!And, for the fan-service crowd: pretty sure the ""DLC content included"" mainly refers to everyone having a swimsuit alt. costume"

This video perfectly describes my buying experience:Gaben Knows How to Take My MoneyMore seriously, after beating the base story once with Ouka, I can say the gameplay is simple enough to pick up. The story isn't anything revolutionary, but your characters pesonality will shine in between the fights. However like most Japanese fighting games, the last boss is a incredible step up in difficulty, but once you figure out how to counter what she likes to spam, you be fine.-------------Update:The continued story mode is unlocked when your done with the main story once. Compared to the standard ""get to and beat the bad guy"" with some dialogue in between, this story mode features a tale with elements from the Cthulhu mythos, particuarly borrowing names and plot points from The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. Saya's crossover visual novel is actually based on Lovecraftian lore too, which is interesting if you like seeing Eldrich abominations as cute anime girls.-------------It has decent replay value, if you enjoy 2d fighters. It also has multiplayer, which I imagine features matchmaking, and is just against another player but I haven't tried it yet.

Not alot of character, but they should at least put 2 characters each from each game. "" Plus, story mode could be even more better with plots like that.""3. Somethimes I think the song are the same <==== My opinion.4. I think the price should at least be $19.99. "" Its a good game, but its not that good to be worth over $29.99. Glad the Coupon drop the price to 20.99""Before you go buy this game: Check your system Requirements, and read other people opinions about this game."
