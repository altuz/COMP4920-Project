Has that CM 01/02 feel, but with updated tactics (e.g. player roles) and match engine. The media nonsense from the main game is gone, replaced with occasional one-off questions with logic answers.I miss the ability to choose individual staff (each category; scouting, medical, etc only has a single department head) and there is no editor (FMRTE is compatible, but it's not free).Despite the name, it is not compromised by touch/tablet support. You can select a normal skin and choose as many leagues as you want if you're only going to play on a PC."

The last time I had this much fun in Football Manager was probably in 2006, but I've been a consistent fan of the product for many years now. In this Touch edition, I love how they streamlined everything. The instant sim is a very nice touch, especially since I'm married with a child. I've been playing soccer manager games since the DOS days back in 1992-93. AC Milan has been my favorite club for 25 years running now. It's really cool to hear AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini give me advice before matches on this game, considering that I managed him on DOS when I was 10 years old lol. This game is so exciting! I highly recommend it."

I use 2D Classic and it's really jumpy, makes it unenjoyable to play. Strange as it ran really smooth on FM16 Touch. Every other aspect of the game is brilliant. Very quick prcessing and layed out really well.  Can reccommend if you can look past the poor match engine,"

Players are easier to buy and amazingly easier to sell, they also give you a reason for not signing, so you know what you need to do to get them, as well as give you the option to negotiate promises. I have never been able to sell anyone for a profit on FM 2016 just wouldnt happen. But now I can sell Valencia to a Chinese club for 20 mil wow! and even enjoy bidding wars. The game feels good all round, tactics are reponsive and  you can really see the changes/tweaks you make translated on the pitch.Drawbacks for me would be its caused my laptop to overheat a few times and shut down :-( it seems to run the fan at full speed while its running, its a bit annoying maybe if the devs cleaned thier code and did a bit of refactoring the game wouldnt be using up such a ridicoulously high CPU % and drain resources, my laptop is good enough to deal with it. 9/10"
,Recommended,482750,32362126,Posted: 12 June,all,SoccerKiller86,"The game is brilliantly made. It's cut all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from FM series and also streamlined tactics and man management significantly.Tactics no longer need to be unrealistic to work. One must have the team to play the tactic properly. So in simple words, if you are tactically smart, then most of the tactics you come up with to use for the team seems to work fine. The engine is very good that way.The transfer process is more efficiently put and is fast but fun at the same time. The market seems easy to work with and seek out players needed properly.I would give it a 9/10."

,Not Recommended,482750,26598737,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,Danger Matt,"Hardest roguelike I've ever played, with no reward loop.  Doesn't matter what I do, I lose, then I get fired, then I get to do it again with the same broken tools.  I think the franchise has forgotten that it's a 'game', because it quickly stops being fun (unless you like rolling dice with the numbers rubbed off).EDIT:After my frustrated rant above, I started using 'Instant Result' and a light dawned.  The Match Plan feature makes a lot of sense when trying to understand what to do during matches.  It also helps explain a little better  why the 'Mentality' tactical options should be used, and how.Problem is, the ability to use a Match Plan is linked only to Instrant Result, and isn't something you can apply pre-game to a match you are about to manage yourself.  Having the Assistant tell you what changes you should make based on your chosen match plan would definately help the more caual player (like me!) get to grips with the mechanics, and even if you said 'yes' to everything, that would basically be the same as pressing Instant Result (with the added immersion you get from watchuing the match engine live).I will stand by my 'broken tools' comment, because there is a big gap between what your Assistant Manager can do with a Match Plan and Instant Result, and what feedback the Assistant currently gives you when you are watching it unfold live.EDIT 2:Good news:Found the Math Plan thing in the match engine!  It was in one of the top dropdowns all along, so that's good, I can now watch the match while my assistant does the donkey work.Bad news:The new tooltip which appears on the Match Plan wizard tells you it is for Instant Result matches and when you don't want to attend the game, so that's what has mislead me, hope they update it soon!Using Match Plans reveals new confusions, as it asks you to pick a starting strategy (I picked Contain/highly structured) which appears loud and proud at the top of your Match Plan summary, as if it's the foundation of your approach.  Problem is, I'd also picked 'play to win' as the template of the Match Plan, so every scenario (from kick-off) used something other than the contain/highly structured stuff I'd picked... so I'm not sure how all that's all working together.Also I've seen screenshots of the full game Tactics screen and it includes a Familiarity bar which tells you how competent your team are with your chosen tactic - a simple and useful piece of indormation that isn't on Touch! You get that info in a monthly email from your AM, but as a streamlined piece of info I'd say that's the sort of thing that Touch needs.. You can change tactics then go back to the email and the bar will have changed (along with the breakdown when you hover over it) but that's more a glitch than a feature.The Familiarity thing also got me thinking about how the Tactics and Match Plans tie together... the game asks you to train with one chosen mentality/team shape, but then rewards you for changing them up during matches, which is counter-intuitive - it's basically saying you will play better by picking unfamiliar mentalities during games, which makes the whole thing harder to fathom.  Seems to me that the whole training/familiarity thing should be around Match Plans, and not one particular tactic within a match plan."

,Not Recommended,482750,31166360,Posted: 15 April,all,pavlolo,"Is a good game but feels rigged. My goalkeepers always make stupid errors even though the ball goes within a foot of them. The assistants often don't see offsides and the commentators often miss them as well. Sometimes I have played matches several times (out of interest, not a desire to win all matches in a season) and the result is largely the same just about every time. Patterns have been noticed with all these replayed matches including comebacks, penalties, cards and timings (for the goals). No tactics ever seem to work. The game's idea of all out attack (overload, route 1, fastest tempo, playing on the flanks and shooting on sight) is to pass the ball calmly (and slowly) through the middle and crossing by the by-line (not about 10 yards before the line of the 18 yard box). I know this is a quicker version of FM without all the fiddly stuff but I think that should include backroom staff being able to sign players and not you. I had a situation where I took over at a recently relegated club and they had 11 first team players, none of whom were very good (had very little transfer budget) and had to delve into the market for freebies. Couldn't find many decent players and just wish backroom staff could have helped. Overall it is a very frustrating game, hope FMT 18 is better or I think I might boycott the series altogether."
