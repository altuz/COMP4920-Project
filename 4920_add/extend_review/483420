,Recommended,483420,32705705,Posted: 23 June,all,IFIYGD,"Overall Rating: 8.5/10Really interesting HOPA, fairly unique in the more Narrative driven game, with a decently good story. A bit odd for some people perhpas, dark and occult themed. But I really enjoyed the blood, violence, occulty theme and bizzare goings on, and hideous demon type characters.Definitely not for kids. No nudity, but the subject matter is not light-hearted, and the story does have a somewhat somber ending. People sensitive to paranormal, occult, dark themes that invlove violence,  blood, death (lots of death), simulated gunfire and demonic energies... yeah. May not be for you.Pros:Really good voice acting, good emotions, good flow, easy to understand, and the voices really fit the characters well.Nice visuals. The art was pleasing, if you like dark and dreary, with a flair. Very well done stylng, and good flow through all episodes with the art.Decently good story. Flows well from episode to episode. A little short in a few places, as if some small detail got cut, but nothing glaring, and enough depth to keep you interested and going on.Nice fast travel map once enabled, and in areas where you are allowed to use it. This did take some leaving one area to trasition through a door to another before it was allowed, but it was not immersion breaking or game slowing, and actually made sense.Decently ominous music for the story and settings, a bit reptitious at times, but not jarring or too much in front of the actual game.Nicely done Hidden Object scenes, not too easy, not too complicated.4 Difficulty modes to choose from, so the most casual or time limted players can enjoy it as much as the most hardcore HOPA players who want time limits and misclick penaties. Nice variety to choose from.Cons:Not too many here, just a few, none too major-Puzzles were a bit too easy for my tastes, but they were different from the average HOPA, so it balanced out nicely.The Magic Watch was a bit boring and uninteresting, but it needed some gimmick, eh?Not much replayability. Only a few areas where you can make different choices, and it does not seem like those will have much effect on the outcome of the game. 7.7 hours for a single playthrough on the 3rd Difficulty setting, not sure I will play it again anytime soon. But maybe in the future, just because I liked the subject and the hunky male protagonist, and the voice actor who played him so much, lol!Full price may be a bit much for this game, but on sale I say ""Get it!"" if you like dark themes and enjoy really narrative driven HOPA's or HOG's. If you don't like a ton of talking, voice acting, and lots of cutscenes, and only want puzzles and HOS's, this may not be the game for you. But then again, it may. I generally don't enjoy Narrative driven HOPA's, and this one was very enjoyable for me, and would have lacked a ton if it wasn't narrative driven.I can't recommend it and the Season Pass at full price, not enough value for the time there. But on deep discount, well worth it. I got the game and Season Pass on sale during the Summer Sale for around $4 USD, and consider it money well spent.Your mileage may vary. Drive carefully."

What at first seemed, then, like a potentially complex and varied bunch of mechanics soon became quite intuitive and user-friendly, though I suspect I would have suffered more ""stumped"" moments if I hadn't made things so painless for myself. Suffice it to say, more experienced HOG-gers may not need to stoop to such lows, but for newcomers such as myself, it's recommended. Just like the game I'm about to review, 'cause I gotta say, for a newbie I was pretty impressed...Not that this game has a reputation for being a typical, run-of-the-mill HOG by any stretch. Apparently it's quite the eclectic mixture of HOG and other point-and-click adventure tropes, and I have to say, it definitely ""worked"". At least for yours truly. Perhaps the main thing I'm saying here is that I didn't quite know what to expect - and held off buying until reviews convinced me otherwise - but I'm quite pleasantly surprised, on the whole.So what DO you get with this game? Scares? Not really. Atmosphere? Sure. Story? Yup, definitely. A cracking good mystery? Hell yes! In fact, this is possibly where Adam Wolfe excels most, both in its storytelling and its chosen form of interactivity, as there's a legitimately ""detective""-esque vibe to it all which actually makes you feel like you're slowly unraveling a mystery, with the occasional moment of life-or-death action to add some real-time tension to it all. That said, there's no denying there's an element of smoke-and-mirrors - the game gives you so much to click on that the ILLUSION of interactivity sometimes exceeds the reality thereof - but when said design tactics create such a genuine sense of involvement with the story, it's pretty hard to complain.I honestly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to almost anyone with a penchant for the ""darker"" side of gaming, irrespective of other genre preferences and prejudices (""I usually only play third person shooters with minor platforming elements"", etc). I certainly won't hesitate to buy the other episodes when I spot them on sale, as five or six bucks an installment is admittedly a tad steep given the length of gameplay on offer (I completed this one in well under two hours). Oh, and as a final selling point for those of you worried about abrupt and unsatisfying endings, rest assured that this first storyline - while it certainly opens the path to others - is a fairly self-contained story in its own right, should you choose to end your adventures there.So really...what have you got to lose? Especially on sale. It certainly left me keen to try out more HOG-style games in the future.Verdict: 8.5/10.(PS For anyone who was wondering, like myself, if the game name and main promo image were suggestive of a cheap Alan Wake rip-off, the similarities honestly end there. Personal myth busted.)"

I have always admired MadHead and I am pretty sure I own all of their games.From the start, this game offers a real departure from the average ""casual"" adventure game.It features an engrossing plot , amazing graphics and very clever interactive action scenes.The voice overs were excellent and felt very real, not just read from a script...I was literally on the edge of my seat a few times and defintely never ever bored.I am really hoping that we will see more of Adam Wolfe !Highly recommended!"
76561198045141591,Recommended,483420,34188096,Posted: 12 August,all,Wolfhowl,"I'll recommend Adam Wolfe to anyone that wants an adventure, Hidden object & puzzle game with a more supernatural detective feel to to it. The game's story structure reminds me of a mini-crime investigation series, with the three first episodes having their own sub-plots, which gets resolved within the episode itself, and the overall story-line being the side-story until the final episode where it all gets resolved.Negatives:None of the characters are really all that interesting to be honest. But then again that is more a crime investigation game, so the focus is more on the mystery than the characters themselves.I feel like the main character's motivation is kinda cliché? Investigating supernatural cases because of a family member's disapperance. Don't get me wrong, it is a good motivation and drives the season storyline forward. But it feels very much like a standard back story. (Kinda like having a Super Hero with a dead family member.)Some scenes are a bit too action packed for the relaxing gameplay. I always think it feels weird to fight in point-and-click gameplay. It just feels weird having to find matching symbols while fighting a monster, or having to slowly take aim in order to shoot your opponent. It fits in the story, but is weird with the gameplay.Positives:The setting is modern-supernatural. It is established early on that you are a supernatural detective, and the way people interact with Adam, both his friend in the police department and others, it is clear that he is not a joke. Which is really nice, considering how many times people try to set supernatural events in our modern world, and just say ""It is all happening in secret and people don't believe it"". Sure, the secret societies is still secret, after all it is a mystery game, but you don't really encounter the overused lines with ""magic/demons/ghosts aren't real!""The developers do a good job at setting the mood for a crime investigating story with their background, brooding serious protagonist, and their sound.The episodic format works well with the story being told. Again, it actually makes it feel like you are playing through a small crime investigation season, where you focus more on other stories until the final episode.Most solutions to the game's puzzles are logical, which does making it a bit ""easier"" than some adventure games out there. But mostly it just helps to make it a nice and relaxing experience."
76561197970585058,Not Recommended,483420,25925043,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,Varkster,"There is no denying this is a very well put together HO style game. Instead of the usual 'mostly static locations you move about and click on things with a few puzzles' what you get is much more like an interactive cinematic experience (with some HO and other puzzles thrown in).The reason for the -ve rating is mostly value for money. I completed the 1st episode in under 80mins, without skipping any of the cutscenes. There were two, maybe three HOPs, and only one other puzzle which took more than a few seconds to solve.So while it's very well crafted, I feel it's way too short. Especially as there are some pretty decent HO games out there with far more content and replay value, despite the (slightly) less glossy presentation. The whole series (4 planned episodes atm) may well be better than any of the other HO games out there at the moment. But will cost at least four times as much. And I don't feel the extra gloss is worth it. If anything, it actually detracts from the puzzle-solving aspects.If what you want is a well presented interactive story (which is very standard 'supernatural dectective' fare) this is almost certainly for you. If you want puzzles and good value casual gameplay; then probably less so."

On par with the Artifex games but taking a different approach, aiming to be a bit grittier than usual. Rather than finding a butterfly shaped key you might shoot a dude, for example. Then it's back to looking through piles of junk for a teapot or a screwdriver."

,Recommended,483420,33048429,Posted: 30 June,all,Caenis Snow,"Definitely a great game.  I really enjoyed it.  Great voice acting, humorous moments where the game kinda pokes fun at itself, a few hidden object games, but it mostly feels more like a point and click to me.  Great fun.  Played all four chapters.  Hope this company will make more like this one.  (Wrote a little longer review with screenshots on my blog.)  Definitely worth getting if you enjoy these kinds of games, but take note to get the whole thing, not just the first chapter.(Wish the 'chapter' thing would stop.  I prefer one complete finished game and will *always* refuse to buy until the games sell as a whole.)"
76561198173606567,Recommended,483420,33798161,Posted: 25 July,all,KeinSchiesse,"If you're looking for a contemporary take on the ""old""Point N Click / Adventure SCUMM type games that doesn't lean too heavily into the tedium of the less-appealing (imo) Hidden Object tag often associated with the gameplay of recent releases in that genre, then this game provides for some well-done visuals, ambiance/sound effects and most prominently voice-acting. I think the frequent voiceover / narration from the protagonist adds to the immersion and brisk-feeling pace of the game,while the game's overall setting (investigating paranormal activity) suits this genre well for a modern take.I haven't run into too many of the afore-mentioned ""Hidden Object"" sections in this game, which can feel very plodding and ""click around until you're just done with them"" in other titles for myself, but I also don't have the patience of playing what seems like an intrusive, glorified ""Eye Spy"" type mini game very often in the middle of many Point and Click style games, and find their frequent pairing with the genre obnoxious. They are thankfully sparingly used in this title.If you've yet to try out a recent title in the Point and Click genre, this game presents itself well with its characters, voice-acting, and graphics, Adam Wolfe despite its wack♥♥♥♥♥title is a well-made game in that genre. If you're into detective type settings in games, with a darker storyline and ""magical"" or paranormal/macabre type elements (i.e.  Silence of the Lambs, Wolf Among Us, etc...) you may want to give this first episode a go as well. That being said, I'm still early into the game and do find myself not being super-invested toward it on the whole. I was able to snag the season on sale, and may get around to it at some point, but find my progression in this title to definitely be in brief increments.I can't speak for the entire season, but the introductory episode does a good job portraying what kind of gameplay mechanics, setting, and storyline you'll be into."

The art is fabulous (is it just me or does Adam remind you of Neil Gaiman?), the voice acting is fantastic, and the story really draws you in. Even though there are some of the same kind of puzzles the gameplay not the standard HOG, but with more of a storyline and more interactive. This a beautiful game beautifully executed, and I highly recommend it."

Great graphics and story scenes, tied with continous minigames and unique HO scenes such as fighting monsters. Love the voice acting and the character's abilities which include shooting, going back in time and focusing. You act as a true detective, scanning for fingerprints and reporting your findings via phone. I never experienced having to dodge bullets (laser sight) in a HOG and that just happened haha. Good difficulty settings and interesting enviornments. I have just completed the first chapter, out of four and I am truly madly deeply in love! I highly recommend getting the seasonal pass, as the first episode is only around 1,5h long. Mad Head Games, please make a sequel!"
76561197972279378,Recommended,483420,26425845,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,mystemo,"Terrific game. I came to the game later than most and played episodes 1-3 in succession and only had a week before playing the final chapter so my experience may be slightly different than others that did play it from episode to episode. The pacing of the story was fantastic, the voice acting was perfect and both of these elements kept me sucked in throughout. The visuals are beautiful and the music is equally so that it creates such a great mood for a detective story. The variety of puzzles and hidden object games is definately this games' strength - there is so many types I cannot list them here but again this keeps the game fresh from start to finish.The negatives probably there are two: Firstly the game is fairly easy, even on the hard mode...but this works well in the grand scheme as it keeps the story moving and I didn't feel bored due to that variety of puzzles. Second negative, and this is why I waited until the last chapter was out because it happens so often unfortunately, is it ends abruptly. There is just enough closure to feel satisfied but it does end with 'End of Chapter Four' and then credits and back to main menu. Two extra scenes would have been nice to polish it off.There is definately room for a sequel and I do hope they make one as I was blown away by the quality of this title after playing many hidden object games and this one does get the elements right. It's strength is the variety in the game and pacing of the story. The characters are interesting and I applaud them for getting this right in a 'casual' game where they are often 2 dimensional.Buy it now and enjoy the ride"

To me, this should definitely be game of the year.  As I was playing the game, I could see the time, love and their all that they put into this game.  I had been playing HOGS for around 9 years, and never came across one well done as this.  This was more like playing a movie not a game.  I was hoping out of the time I was playing all these years  that one team would come out with a game that would blow me away and Mad Head delivered.  The voice acting was superb.  The lips and facial expressions and body movements matched perfectly like your watching t.v..  In my opinion this is the game of the year.  I don't think I will ever see a game this well done by another team.   The one aspect of the game I loved was that you owned a revolver.  And you would have shooting matches with your enemies like cops and robbers.  That was fun.  Also note, there is a strategy guide that comes with the four episode version that was very very well done.Story:  You're on a mission to save your sister.  Adam doesn't know the ins or outs of what happened to his sister, but in each episode as he helps other people it brings him one step closer to finding his sister.  This is one very intriguing story.  Like a novel you couldn't put down.  You have to find out what's going to happen next.Graphics:  Absolutely stunning.  A lot of the scenes could look real.Music:  I loved it.  They made it fit with what was happening in the scene at that time.Mini Games:  Very nice variety.  These games were made specifically for this game.Map:  Very nicely done.  You have indicators on the map that sparkle telling you that is where you need to go to next.  It's also a jump map.  You also have a GPS you use when you are going to a new place.Hint System:  Works very well on the outside of HOGS.  I don't see how you can get stuck in the game.HOGS:  I won't go into detail of the different ones, but it was a really fun variety of them.  In some you would play mini games which I truly love.To me I highly recommend this game.  I'm not sure if Steam has a demo, but if you would like, Big Fish Games does have a demo.  Maybe give it a try if you like.  :-)  Kudos to the team again for an awesome job. :-)"

Without going into too much detail I will say that if you are a fan of the Harry Dresden book series by Jim Butcher and the television show Supernatural, you will probably like Adam Wolfe.In each of the episodes you play as the character Adam Wolfe, a man on a mission to find his sister.  In every episode there is a new case to solve that comes with a supernatural twist, leaving tantalizing clues about what happened to your sister.  But fear not, with your trusty sidearm and no small amount of sarchastic wit--that's a superpower right? you can handle most things.This is a game series that both beginner and seasoned gamers can enjoy.  The graphics are crisp, detailed, and well thought out; they add to the story rather than distract.  The puzzles/mini games are appropriate for the story, and the occasional pause to sort through the miscellaneous are brief and not overdone. Players with find themselves being drawn in to the enhanced world that Adam inhabits and perhaps not wanting it to end.  I highly reccomend this game."

You had time to think about what has been happening, discuss it with friends, rush home for the next part.I was pleasantly surprised by the four episodes of Adam Wolfe. A solid detective adventure set in San Francisco, a case is solved in every episode and there is the arch over all four, the search for Allie, Adam’s sister.Again this four part format gave me time to mull things over - and looking forward to the next episode.Mad Head Games is no new territory to me. I’ve played most of their games and loved them. They always bring new and very creative elements in their HOPA’s.In Adam Wolfe as well. Not only we play from two perspectives: we see Adam Wolfe in cutscenes, in graphic novel style story boards, then we change perspective and play as him.Sometimes there is a lot of action: we use a gun, have to hide, use our legs and feet, swing on the Golden Gate Bridge, drive, jump, get shot … phew!Gameplay was great, music very catching, graphics fantastic.Voice Over was simply brilliant. In some HOPA’s you have the impression that relatives and friends read the texts just to have this bit covered, here it was absolutely professional and gripping.Even after years of playing HOPA’s I still like Hidden Object Scenes, if they are as innovative as in this game. The puzzles were a good mix of new ones and not so new ones, but nicely presented.Hopefully there will be more games in four parts by Mad Head!"

I personally didn't mind it.Pro's:StoryMechanicsPriceGood balance of Challenge/ProgressionCon's:Sometime's I just wanna get out my gun and shoot demons, and it won't let me :("

It looks beautiful, has an intriguing story line (supernatural) and a fun fast-feeling pace. I definitely recommend it if you are a fan of hidden object adventure games."

But then all too often the plot becomes too predictable. It also starts off giving you an illusion of choice in what order to do things in, but all that is dropped during the second half and the game doesn't even attempt to cover the railroad tracks. This combined with the fact that you can't really get game overs and that the general difficulty level is very easy even on the highest difficulty leads to boredom.Most of the elements in this game are actually good, but the execution is a bit off.Episode 1 is alright, ep2 is great, ep3 is a bore. Ep4 is a bore too but has a decent ending. Unfortunately I didn't really care much at that point anymore."

,Recommended,483420,33375662,Posted: 8 July,all,Don John,"The villain for Episode 4 takes his name directly from Watchmen, the ending of the whole story sucks, and the game has a really bad case of ""But Thou Must"" going for it.  That being said, it has some interesting mechanics but I wouldn't pay full price for it.  Wait for the big sales.Oh, and I believe it's in Episode 3 that this well established detective of the supernatural indicates that the first encounter of episode one was the first time he encountered the supernatural... despite being called in on that case for his expertise.  They constantly call the main villains by the wrong name.  It's ok to take your cellphone deep sea diving, but not your gun. Maybe pay full price so they can afford to proof-read the script for the sequel."

,Not Recommended,483420,29565527,Posted: 29 January,all,operationflipswitchjunkie,"7/10 - Buy this on a sale!It's not a bad game in and of itself. I just regret spending so much money on it because in my opinion, it wasn't worth it.The story is all right. Not particularly exciting but enough to go along.I especially love the graphics! Some of the scenes were SO beautiful, they really reminded me of aquarell/ watercolour paintings. Very beautiful indeed and probably the best thing about this game.I also enjoyed some new aspects that aren't typical of other HOG that I know. Something like the watch and certain other puzzles.The character design of certain supernatural beings was amazing, honestly. This game definitely hit its creepy flair.The music was all right, definitely not that one annoying looped track. Everything had a very cinematic feel, if I may say so.On the other hand some of the graphics looked bad or awkward. The voices didn't match the movements, etc. Now usually I wouldn't mind something like that from HOG, but since I spent so much money on this one I did expect a little more.The playing experience wasn't particularly good either. The game held the players hand the entire time. It always went ""something happens - game tells you what to do next"". The puzzles were way too easy and I didn't spend longer than a minute on one. There wasn't a single incident where I was truly puzzled.Overall, I wouldn't say I don't recommend the game. I just think it's too expensive given what it delivers and I would rather spend the money on something better next time!"

I don't typically like episodic games because most times it takes to long between each episode but that was not an issue with this game.  I loved the graphics and the game play.  The story line was entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat.  I wanted to keep playing to find out where the story was going and I was so disappointed when the game was over.  Mad Head did and awesome job on this game and I so hope they will be doing more like this in the very near future.  :)  Thank you Mad Head Games for an exciting game.  I really really enjoyed it.

The quality is excellent.  I love the mini games, the dialog and the cut scenes.  There is a creative approach to the HOPs that make them even more fun.  It is smartly written, sarcastic at times and exciting.  I wish there were 10 episodes!  I recommend this game for sure and look forward to the next Mad Head Games production!"

A story that grabs you from the get go and holds you..making you want more. The graphics were surreal in their own way. The sound track seemed to have a life of it's own. Each character was made for it's part in the plot. The puzzles were so much a part of the game that felt as if they belonged there...and there was perfect blend of variety! The adventure and machanics of the game grabbed me and made me feel as though I was actually participating in the adventure and story of Adam Wolfe's life. I didn't want to stop once I started and wanted to keep going after episode 4. I have not played a game series that was this absorbing in long time. All I can say that is this is a game that is worth having.  And it is one that is for mature audiences because of the content.
,Recommended,483420,29443120,Posted: 23 January,all,Diolyx,"In Adam Wolfe, you'll be setting demons on each other, shooting criminals in the face, rewinding time and facing off with Death. It is about time someone made a hopa like this. It's cinematic, mature and very fast paced. You play as a detective who investigates the supernatural, who gets caught up in a battle between cultists and demons. It feels like the plot comes first, which is a nice change for this sort of game.Adam Wolfe isn't a protagonist who gets an easy ride through the story. You won't be playing as the chosen one, you won't always win and there will be consequences to your actions. If you're tired of point and click games with locks on every door, drawer and filing cabinet you find, this is the game for you."
,Recommended,483420,33922768,Posted: 31 July,all,Hoppipolla,"I simply love this game. The realistic hidden object is the most interesting thing in the most of the entire game. I wish there'll be more games like this by another developer with the same kind of realisticly hidden object puzzle game. The story's pretty simple, not going round and back. The price's super worth it (even though without sale).Though the ending was not exactly what I expected and there's still questions here and there for me regarding for the story and the ending, I'll give 9,5/10 for the gameplay."
