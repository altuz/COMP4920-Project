,Recommended,483970,31763204,Posted: 14 May,all,byteframe,"First off, hail Stan. I'm pretty sure he likes this title. It is a short, but very sweet creep-you-out experience with pentagrams and eyeballs. I loved the environment, both inside the house and out. It could have used a little bit of a delay before triggering the next sequence, so you might want to savor and soak in the house before it transforms and everything goes haywire.This is an excellent way to spend a space buckhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=898132815"

Short but intense experience, can\'t really say much without spoiling it. Visually, the models and textures could use improvement; not sure if it\'s intentional, but a lot of visuals don\'t mesh well together and immersion suffers slightly as a result. Also, the book you start the experience with is just awful, literally MS Paint textures with 4th wall breaking...Aside from these minor issues, the experience itself is great if your stomach can handle it."

The 'horror' part is really just where they took all the 'Best VR Practices for not inducing nasua' and then did them all.The entire experience is 6 minutes, total.  I know it's only a dollar, but honestly there's free games inifinitely better than this.  I'm surprised the author has the audacity to charge for what is essentially a very poor demo."

At no point did I feel creeped out like the intention seemed to be, it was too over the top and nonsensical.  Feels like a bunch of random effects and assets thrown at the player.  Just as I was thinking it was starting to go somewhere interesting, the credits popped up.Hate to bash on some experimental VR stuff, but it really doesn't feel like something that should be charged for."
,Recommended,483970,23898593,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Creep,Very short and non-interactive. Can't go wrong for 99 cents though. The ending creeped me the heck out.

Can't honestly say whether or not it's worth the buck, but I do love weird things. This fits the bill. And for less than the price of those beaks and feet that the fast food industry calls ""chicken nuggets"". So, take that as you will.7/10Would consider giving my soul to The Dark Lord again."
,Recommended,483970,23357635,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Zizi Thrush,"At first I thought I was about to experience a horror animation, and while it had elements of it, I felt the very real buildup of an unknown force, and instead of getting the usual ""build-up/payoff"" structure of a horror animation, it would just twist and turn you to different events. However, it was quite a nice feeling. Genuine anxiety, with a payoff that's not really scary, but a feeling of relief more so. I think this would hinder a standard animation or game out-of-vr, but in this case it helped it. Plus there are some really nice visuals."

The 99 cents I spent on this demo did not fill me with regret and shame like those fries did.It's really a fantastic experience. My only complaint is that it's not long enough, but those 7 minutes are pretty awesome. It's a great demo for people who already have a little experience in VR. I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to VR though, because the motion may be too much for beginners or those who are prone to nausea.And seriously, for the price, you get a cool 7 minute demo to try out and show other people. In my mind, it is a must purchase for Vive owners"

Costs much less than a rollercoaster ride and provides more entertainment, I'll probably go back a few times since I really liked the atmosphere. Might lead to paranoia if experienced under the influence of drugs, I assume (not that I'd know)."

But if you like paying developers for their time and creativity this is worth it. Some really enjoyable reality-bending scenes in here and I want to see more like this on the Vive. I hope that the developer allows for a ""free-play"" version to spend more time in specific scenes. It will be great to show off to friends who can handle the motion. Definitely the textures could use improvements but overall gets the point across."

,Recommended,483970,23801383,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,The White Mamba,"It's a short experience (~5 minutes), but it still gives a silly yet creepy vibe. There are some unique perspective changes throughout the experience that show off VR in a really neat way (though it might make you dizzy/nauseous). It felt like a nightmare with its dream-like oddities. It's well made, and for only $1, I think it's worth it, especially if you want to show friends."

,Recommended,483970,23782713,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,Endothermic,"Have to say that this is interesting, even among other ""experience"" VR games.  Definitely helps that it only costs as much as a gas station coffee because it'll really only last you as long as a gas station coffee would.Also important to note: this game focuses on messing up perspectives, which I thought meant that there'd be weird puzzles or cool setpieces with mirrors or something.  It ACTUALLY means that you'll probably spend at least two minutes hands-and-knees on the floor because you're so dizzy and disoriented you forgot how to walk.  I wasn't straight-up motion sick persay, but I was at least 20% sure I was going to die.Basically the video game equivalent of a morning gas station coffee, which is not the diss it sounds like.  Come on, I know you all like gas station coffees or else the line to the cash register wouldn't be so ungodly long on weekdays."

For a while, I could never get through the first section of the game because the idea of being alone in a small cabin with big windows in the woods at night was creepy enough. (Especially after watching the movie Hush...) But once I forced my way through that opening part of this minigame (or mostly non-interactive VR short), it really lost its horror edge and became just a bunch of weird colors and shapes and unnecessary changes in perspective. A pointless gimmick and waste of time."
