,Recommended,483980,25647257,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,AestheticGamer,"Mad Father is a Wolf Editor Horror Game (think of it similar to an RPG Maker Horror Game) which originally released in 2012 (and was translated into English in 2013). This Steam release marks a rework of the game with an overall nicer layer of polish & some new content. I've only dabbled in the Steam release a bit at the time of writing to compare some early game differences, but I had played the game & gotten every ending back with the freeware version.I'll start off this review with a general review of the game itself, followed then a mention of some of the new content & early game differences.-----GENERAL REVIEW:-----The game follows the story of Aya Drevis, a young 11-year old girl who lives in an expansive mansion with her father, Alfred, & their maid, Maria. Aya is aware that her father does somewhat cruel experiments with a chainsaw to people in their mansion basement, but she still loves her father all the same. She has seen his good traits and love he gives to her as his daughter. However, one night she awakens to some odd sounds, & finds shambling corpses and other strange beings wandering the mansion with murderous intent. A curse has been put upon the mansion from the countless people Aya's father has slaughtered, & now the dead walk among them seeking revenge on the Drevis family. The only way to escape now & save your dad is to lay these spirits to rest, either through forgiveness or force.Mad Father gained a strong cult following for good reason, it has a number of creative & interesting varied scenarios despite its simple nature, ranging from puzzles, to light stealth, story, exploration, minigames, & backed with good gothic atmosphere with just a hint of the fantastical. While the main setting of the game is a Mansion, you quickly begin to descend in it, finding surreal labyrinths with intricate detail & interesting elements to each room. Some play a role in gameplay, others are simply interesting to look at. As you explore you'll come to face a number of challenges & entities who want you and your dad dead. You must find a way to put the spirits at rest, & make your way to your father deep in his underground labs. Along the way there is a colorful cast of odd characters you learn more about, & a number of side-quests off the beaten path you can partake in (they're optional to complete the game, but needed to get the true ending, though of note is the whole mansion is explorable even at the end of the game, you can go all the way back to the starting room of the game from the final room of the game).While the story isn't surprising, it is well-told and full of charisma. Aya is a likable protagonist and her relationship with her twisted father is interesting, & the members of the core cast and their interconnecting relationships are just as interesting (if not more so). The journey is engaging all the way through if you're into these 2D RPG-Horrors, & will easily give you a good 3-6 hours of playtime (depending on how much you explore, how many endings you go for, do 'optional' stuff or not, etc). It has a charm to it simply due to its tone, a mixture of a Victorian-styled setting & characters combined with a more modern twisted sci-fi mad scientist doctor via our father and the gruesome undead experiments of his, forging a sort of scientifically twisted vs supernaturally malicious scenario. It's an interesting contrast that creeps its way into various aspects of the game I just find wholly fascinating.I will mention while the game has some good atmosphere, it isn't all that scary, nor is it trying to be. There is the occasional moment or scene, but the game aims more to unsettle you as a mood-piece with a central interconnected narrative and attract you with elements of intrigue, abstractness, & feeling to set a tone than to startle or even shock you. This said, some of the scenes are rather tense and creepy.If you're into the scene of 2D Horror games that came from the like of Wolf Editor and RPG Maker, this one is definitely worth checking out if you haven't before.-----FOR THOSE WHO'VE PLAYED BEFORE:-----But then for those who have played it before, you may ask yourselves, ""What's new here? What makes this worth $5 compared to the previously free version?""The first thing you'll probably notice as you play is the graphics have been updated in almost every room of the game. Some rooms have been changed drastically with completely new layouts & details; they hardly resemble the rooms from the original. Others just have nice new touches that help bring them more alive & add character. In the mansion at the beginning there wasn't a room I encountered that hadn't seen some sort of overhaul, and the touches look very nice! Along with the new spritework, there is also a few new pictures that pop up during cutscenes to give more life to them & the previous pictures have been revamped to look much nicer. Also has new enemy sprites, better sprite animation & details, more detailed death scenes, & other touch-ups.For an example of the graphical difference, here's a comparison of Aya's Room:Aya's Room (Original Game):https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0a14bb4150eed0064df5b8652e6b1e3/tumblr_ody8hvPxRt1se6ntfo2_400.pngAya's Room (Steam Release):https://67.media.tumblr.com/49e7dac7f473ffb5719a3391c9712f5e/tumblr_ody8hvPxRt1se6ntfo1_400.pngAnd so far, most rooms have been drastically redone like this.The game had to get rid of things it couldn't use for commercially, with the element that stands out the most being the music. Most of the original OST is present, but there are a few new original music tracks in this version of Mad Father in-place of the few unusable songs they had. I've only heard a couple new songs thus far, but I like them! They fit the game nicely & don't feel out of place. I may even like them more than the originals.The game also has some new ease of use elements. Aya now will have exclamations pop over her head when near things she can interact with or investigate. Items glitter now to stand-out, so you don't have to observe everything just to find key items hidden in shelves or the like, & the hit-detection feels much better & smoother than before. The UI/Menu is completely reworked, & the QTEs the game previously had have a new gameplay style where instead of rapidly pressing a button, you now must press a series of buttons before time runs out (with an improved UI element as well).While I can't speak in full length as I haven't quite beaten the new version of the game, there are some new dialogue & scenes in the game. There is some changes to the layout of the locations as I said before, some new areas as a result. The dev has also said there's some new optional side-stories to uncover, new scenes, & some of the gems have been relocated.There's also a new ""IF"" option on the title screen, which is unlocked once you get the True Ending (not sure what it is, tho).Game also comes with the Steam features of Trading Cards & achievements (which there's a 27 of).Some may not find the new all that new, but it's made revisiting this game a joy for me so far, and as I loved the original I don't mind putting down some money for a revamped version with some new paint & some additional content to support future endeavors.-----OVERALL:-----While some may want to stick to the free version for its 'freeness', I think this version of Mad Father is an overall improvement which will be the best way to experience the game for either new players or fans of the original. Maybe not the huge expansion some may have hoped for, but the much more detailed & realized world along with the various additions, changes, & fixes all feel in-line with the vision of the original game while in my opinion steadily improving on it. Mad Father had a cult audience & will find new fans. If these type of games interest you, I do think is wholly worth checking out."

I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself.Mad Fatherhas this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots.

,Recommended,483980,28785287,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Eyzi,"The description on its Steam page is actually you need to know before you start playing the game. The whole gameplay is just as interesting as my first impression of it when I first saw the title and the capsule art. It's so fun and immersive that I didn't even notice I've been playing this for over seven hours already.Mad Father is about a crazy family. You play the role of Aya Drevis, a ten year old daughter of a mad scientist. Despite being aware of her father's inhumane hobby, Aya still loves and respects him. The story begins at midnight of her mother's death anniversary who, according to her father, died of an illness. While attempting to sleep, she heard her father scream for help, and she is determined to come to his rescue. However, the further she goes, the more she learns about her father's nature.There's not much to say about the story. It is fairly straightforward and even predictable. That's not to say that the story wasn't good. In fact, knowing how it unfolds adds to the excitement because the gameplay is almost the story in and of itself. Every character is very likeable except the father, although the father still has a reasonable motive behind his actions. There's no other word to describe him other than 'Mad', which stays true to the title of the game. While the gameplay is a masterpiece, the selling point of this game is the art. I must say that it was what made me want to get this game in the first place, and it didn't let me down. The game was an eyecandy until the end despite the dark and gore theme. The music was also very ambient. I honestly did not notice the background music, and that's a good thing. That means it was a part of story.Overall, This is one of the games where the story, gameplay, art, and music all work together seamlessly. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to everyone regardless of your taste in games. Besides, who doesn't want to be a little girl whose weapon of choice is a chainsaw?"

I'm very glad to be able to support the developers after all this time. It's a short-but-sweet, but nonetheless excellent, story driven adventure puzzler of sorts. A real gem for anyone that is a fan of horror or slashers."

Though the jump scares weren't anything to sneeze at, the music and atmosphere that it brought really brought the game together as a horror RPG. I adore the sprite animations, and I really enjoyed the 'If' Ending because it was refreshing to step into another character's shoes, if only for a brief moment.This game has fantastic replay value and the achievements are manageable for even the less seasoned players. I got so frustrated my first play through when I ruined my chances of a True Ending because I didn't properly explore, but it was so fun starting over again to guarantee the ending that I wanted to experience.Overall, it's a well made, beautifully atmospheric game that's very afforrdable to play if you're really not sure about the style!"
,Recommended,483980,28128319,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,◆ ʟɪɢʜᴛ ◆,"This....one messed up game......but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.Yet another gem on Steam that unfortunately many would let slip by. Personally, I couldn't recommend it enough, due to the resonable pricetag for all what its worth as an experience.The game, had one of the most original and unique plots I've ever come across in a top down RPG game. I personally was so engaged and moved by the storyline that I just couldn't find the leeway on leaving the game half way through without having curiousity lingering in my mind.Consequently, I managed to finish the entire game in straight 5-7 hours, collecting all the achievements whilst emphasizing on the comprehension of dialogue and minor details to get the perfect grasp on what the game had offered and truly, it was worth it.By the end of the game, my experience regarding the game was unsettling due to the disturbing plot and the many twists that it had as per the progression in game but regardless of that, they were part of the escapade which was, dare I say, amusing.Mad Father, as the title goes by is a psychological horror that offers exceptional soundtracks for every scenario in the game, an atmospheric top down level design, minor puzzles, simple controls and grotesque material / content in compliance with an innovative yet captivating plot. It comprises of multiple endings for which the choice is to be made at the very end of the game for the subsequent ending.Final summation.A fine indie rpg,  purely a bang for the buck, twisted yet fascinating."

I remember playing free version about 3 years ago and I enjoyed the story and all the spooky moments, so I was pretty happy to see that it's been remastered and made it to steam. And to be honest this version is way better than the original, not only visually, but because it got some additions to the storyline.If you enjoy horror rpgmaker games that have beautiful graphics and a nice story with some plot twists, then you'll certainly enjoy this game. Storyline is quite short and takes a couple of hours to run through, but it's certainly worth it's price."

Great story that you will slowly uncover as you explore wonderful handmade levels of a vast german mansion, meet lots of different characters and find out the story behind them, solve various different puzzles and do your best avoiding the dangers of the mansion! You will die and you will die a lot, but thats part of learning the levels and enemies, besides there are plenty of places to save your game manually and there is autosave too, so its not frustrating at all to play it.There are 3 different endings, with bonus cutscenes if you collect certain items, so its worth playing it at least twice.

,Recommended,483980,28792100,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Farixy,"I first heard about Mad Father a few years ago when it first (I believe) was released and started getting attention by famous Youtubers such as PewDiePie and so on. I never watched any of those ""Let's plays"" because I'm not necessarily interested in those kinds of videos. The reason why I kept receiving suggestions of videos of Mad Father is most likely due to the fact that I did make an exception and watched a ""Let's play"" of a similar game called ""The Crooked Man"", though I never paid any attention to Mad Father the name of the game stuck with me, probably because it's quite easy to remember.Anyways, a few months ago I saw that the game was released on Steam and generous as I am when it comes to spending money on games I don't need and may never play for that matter, I decided to buy it since it was only $5 with an extra 10% off as a special launch price. I did intend on playing it when I first bought it, but the problem with owning as many games as I do is that I always scroll though my library looking for something to play but due to having so many options I usually just end up playing Rocket League or Team Fortress 2, so Mad Father quickly turned into just ""another"" game in my library.Yesterday however I got around to installing and playing the game and I got to say that I am genuinely suprised of how much I actually enjoyed it.I got hooked on the game after only playing it for a couple of minutes thanks to the story of the game. In fact, I would like to take a moment to appreciate how original and unique the story felt and played out, it was twisted and disturbing least to say. It's quite rare that I get hooked on a games story, but this one really punched me in the face. The story develops amazingly during the 4-6 hours it takes to complete the game (If I were smarter and didn't have to look up Youtube videos explaining what to do all the time I'm sure I could have completed it way quicker). It's filled with twists and decisions which eventually leads to the 3 possible endings. Now while I would like to put on my tinfoil hat and bring up 50 different theories spinning around in my head after completing it, I think it's in everyone's interest that I keep this review spoiler free.The game is, however, of course not for everyone. The gameplay can possibly  be considered dull by a lot of people if you're not into these types of games. But I strongly recommend you taking a couple of hours of your day to play this game from start to finish even if the gameplay may not suite you, because the story really was an experience not to turn your back on.Besides the fantastic story the game was very well designed, the artstyle and the level design really built an atmosphere that went hand-in-hand with the gameplay and really did a good job on capturing the sinister plot of the game. In fact, everything just simply worked together, the music, the illustrations, the sound effects, visual effects, the very limited voice acting and the writing itself.Now a lot of people are wondering if it's worth picking this one up for $5 considering the original version is completely free. As someone who's never played the original one I can't really compare the versions back to back, however, as I mentioned I did watch a few videos on Youtube to figure out how to progress in the game and I can say that this version simply does look way better in every aspect, but I guess that goes from one individual to another depending on what art-style you personally enjoy. But if anything by buying it you will support great indie developers who I think really outdid themselves on this one, and I really hope to see more games like this pop up on Steam in the future. There are most likely a few more differences between the versions, but I haven't really looked into it myself.To sum things up, really well written and original story (especially for a originally free indie game) that is acompanied by great visuals and sound design. For $5 you really do get what you pay for, even more considering there are 3 endings with room for a sequel. If you're a horror fan like me (or not) I suggest you pick this one up and experience it yourself."

First it didn't seem to have much difference, expect for new look, but near the end there was more new stuff to look at. Especially the ""IF"" option after you get the true end. That was most interesting part of this Steam version.So I'll say if you have played the first one take a look at this if you're fan. If you didn't like the first version this one probably won't grab you either.But if you haven't played the free version, take a look at this first. It's well worth the money. And then maybe check the free version after, out of curiosity sake."
,Recommended,483980,25729768,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,Dicher,"As someone who has never played or even heard about the game, I gotta say this game is pretty good and totally worth the asking price.I originally saw a post from a local site about this game being newly released on steam. I don't even read the article, I only saw the post's thumbnail and then checked it straight away on steam. As i begin scrolling the thumbnail on the steam page, I see a busty anime woman and a cute loli girl - something that a weeb like me totally dig. Oh and also, it's cheap so I bought it without any second thoughts.So the first one hour of the game I got bored 'cause I hit a dead end and don't know where else to go. So I googled a bit about the game and to my surprise there is actually a free version of the game. To be honest, even though I already said it's cheap, I actually considered to refund the game and get the free version instead. But eventually I decided to give it another chance until I finally passed the 2 hours mark. At some point I finally got hooked up and I finished the game in one sitting.Moving on to the game itself, I think Mad Father is a pretty well made exploration horror game. While I don't play horror games much, I think most of the game mechanics are quite similar to the more popular survival horror games, e.g. the puzzle solving, jumpscares, and monster hide and seek. And it manages to do it well in 2D. Coupled with a decent level design and music, you have a pretty sweet $5 package for the gameplay alone. As for the story, it also manages to surprise me and exceed my expectations. The characters are pretty okay, there are some plot hole and obvious plot convinience but overall it's good. There are quite a bit of disturbing mysteries to discover, and it concludes to a mildly surprising climax. What I like the most are the endings, not only the ending themselves but how to get all of them. I was forced to replay the game from the beginning because I missed some of the prerequisites for a certain ending but I don't get mad at all, in fact I realized how much I liked this game after doing my second playthrough straight after finishing the first one. I also like how each ending played outwhich is quite...gruesome in my opinion.So to sum it up, Mad Father is a great game overall, it has a nice gameplay and a good story. Totally would recommend."

The upgraded graphics look awesome, the new music is very nice, and I appreciate the new scenes that were added (the added Ines scene in particular is wonderful). It's not a flawless remake, however.The random ""Aya...I gonna get you"", which sounds absolutely nothing like any of the other voice clips used for Alfred Drevis, is just...well, it's dumb. Stick with the original Japanese audio, please. That line seriously made me cringe, and not in a good way.There also seems to be some missing audio - Dr. Drevis' scream at the beginning is completely silent, for example.Achievements are also broken, but hopefully those will be fixed soon.Lastly, Aya seems to have issues with stairs in the version, which got me killed by the first zombies a few times.So:Is it perfect? No. Not at all. It's got flaws. Hopefully those will be patched (if the developers are reading this: hi! Also please remove that English voiceover for Dr. Drevis. It's...just bad.)But is it worth $5? Absolutely. That's not even a question for me. The game has issues, but nothing that makes it not worth the price. Even if you've already played the free version, I still recommend purchasing this."

At launch the game was very crash-prone and I would've been more hesitant to recommend, but it's been patched up since then and is working fine again, with my own problems running the game being solved by switching AppLocale to English.It's very much in the style of games like Ib or The Witch's House, with a focus on being playable and completable by anyone, and it's got some nice variety for a short game, a great sense of atmosphere and dread, some very good use of free assets to strong effect (including lots of examinable details), and keeps your motivation to get to the end going until it's all over. It is probably a little too easy for some (as someone who is terrible at adventure games, though, it's nice to have puzzles I can solve by myself) but is a lot easier and more player-friendly than The Witch's House, and has some neat little character moments (even if it relies a lot on flashbacks). An easy recommendation if you like short-form games, and there's also incentive to play a second time for more details you missed the first time.A more in-depth review available herehttp://gaminghell.co.uk/MadFatherWarning.html"

Systems: Windows 8.1, Windows 10; loading issue has been solvedThe story of beautyIt looks like a classic fighting RPG - attacking monsters and the cruel end boss. It's anything but.Mad Fatheris a mystery game which tells the story of young Aya. A terrible curse has fallen on her father's mansion, creatures crawl through the halls, and ghosts hunt the weak. Knowing she needs to find a way past the atrocities, Aya goes on a difficult journey -- to save her father.Eager to try this classic gem, I bought the game on Halloween 2016. The look of the graphics made me feel nostalgic, the game play looked like a challenge and the story appealed to me due to its gruesome theme. When do you get to play Frankenstein's daughter? Rarely. And for sure not in Anime-style.As player, you control Aya with the classical arrow keys (keyboard). Your aim is finding and saving your father. While you solve the riddles in the mansion, you uncover more of the terrible details, and also about your own past. When you get caught by a monster, you'll end up smashing your buttons in order to escape its grasp, left, right, left, up, down, and I'm telling you, you need to be fast.The game has become a collocation of quick time events and sneak scenes, while you need to figure out where to find and use your items. This leads to a refreshing gameplay and a rich story. For once, you're not the almost invincible main character, but a weak girl who will be left alone if you fail. Adding the multiple endings and the loveable characters, this game is a must have for every mystery/horror fan who is also into Anime. The screenshots don't lie!"

I guess you could go to the translator's website and play basically the same game for free, but it's worth it to support Sen.Pros about this game:*the translator, vgperson, does great work*it's a horror game with only a few jumpscares, and most of those are very mild*the music is quite lovelyCons:*the sound design can be really annoying at times. Aya's scream in particular sounds more like somebody stole her cupcake and less like she got murdered by sentient dolls.  even when the scream was part of a cutscene, my sister would look up from across the room and say, did you die again?*there's a lot of backtracking. it's definitely not as bad as other games in the genre, but still enough to be tedious.

,Recommended,483980,28287596,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,Pippala,"I almost overlooked this game. The art style (Alice in Wonderland-esque Lolita) almost put me off, but I’m so very glad it didn’t. If you are unsure about small, indie Wolf RPG maker games, please give this one a shot.The gameplay is fairly simple, puzzle-adventure stuff but I stayed for the story. At first glance the plot is pretty basic and within a few minutes of playing you find yourself making certain predictions about the path the narrative will take. But that was part of the charm – the game reveals a lot of information to you early on, leaving you to explore the rest of the game with that knowledge hanging over your head. With the majority of the big reveals out of the way, you are then allowed to learn more about the characters, discover their deeper motivations and histories, including some careful clues about the protagonist you might miss. Even seemingly minor characters like Maria end up becoming a complex issue for the protagonist.The story is quite linear however, there are not many choices to make. All of the endings can be unlocked from the final scene so there’s no need to backtrack. The puzzles are easy, except for a few I found more difficult because my reflexes seize up when a murderous corpse-doll is running at me.But what I really want to do is talk about the endings and the characters, so from here on out there will be[spoilers]……This is a story about victims of abuse, and how the women in the Mad Father’s life use different strategies to survive in that kind of environment.So let’s start from the beginning.The Mad Father himself, Alfred Drevis, was a troubled boy who enjoyed killing animals for fun. His first victim was his mother. In an argument over his proclivity for sadism, he stabs her and fawns over how beautiful she looks in death. Obsessed with creating an eternal beauty, he conducts experiments to turn human remains into dolls. Your typical creepy psychopath type, he is the most underdeveloped character – but that’s okay. We don’t need him to be developed, he may give the game its title but this story is not really about him.He murders his way across Europe and in a small German village attempts to murder a local woman, Monika, but for an unknown reason is unable to. It’s implied that she was exposed to horrific things growing up in her ex-cultist mansion, and that this has affected her view of affection. The religious cult sacrificed humans out of love for their deity, and when she was put in a similar position as a potential murder victim, she felt excited rather than afraid. This was how love looked like to her. She invited him to live with her in the mansion, and soon gave birth to Aya.(It’s possible the father’s experiments on the sacred cult ground was what summoned Mr Ogre in the first place)She never showed sadistic traits herself, but she nurtures and cares for the sadistic traits in others. Hence Aya, the player controlled character, begins to show signs of cruelty. She kills cats. Her mother catches her a rat to play with, with the words “I could have cried from delight. To think she enjoys it so. Perhaps she resembles her father in curiosity? I look forward to seeing her mature.” Implying Aya did not treat the unfortunate rat well. Aya mistreats her pet rabbit Snowball, cutting its leg with a chainsaw and (as snowball is cloned whenever it gets hurt) judging by the number of dead Snowballs in jars, she has done it many times. She is all kept from the player, Aya even lies to her father and to the player at the same time when in her flashback she says she’s worried about losing Snowball. It’s only in the true ending when she is an adult is the player invited to put two and two together.(Adult Aya runs a small clinic in a forest, helping the poor get medical care for free. A young woman called Jean comes for treatment, and the two of them flirt heavily. Then Aya murders her. For me personally, having Aya grow up into a forest hermit lesbian serial killer is the best way this game could have ended.)Aya is conflicted over her feelings for father’s assistant Maria, who he is also sleeping with. At first the game implies Maria could be the one trying to hurt her, but it turns out she cares deeply for both Aya and Monika and regrets any bad blood that rises up between them. She was rescued off the streets by the doctor as a potential victim, but she proved to be a useful assistant. He has no strong feelings for her, but her position is tenuous. She has cultivated a strong attraction to him for self-preservation. If she doesn’t like her job, she dies. So she likes her job. It is implied strongly at first that she could be a doll with her inhuman eyes, but this is a red herring. She may not be a physical doll but she is the complete puppet of the father.The reveal at the end is that Monika was not really so jealous of Maria, and it was because the father wanted to turn Aya into his next doll that she put into motion the events of the story. And here’s the interesting part: In no ending is it possible to prevent Aya becoming a doll. The secret ending makes that clear – father’s work will go on, with or without Aya. she WILL be objectified, whether she likes it or not.With this in mind all of the women, Aya, Maria, Monika, show different ways that people cope with abusive situations. This is also true of some of the test subjects like Ines, who was groomed to be Aya’s big sister until the doctor got bored of her. All of them are complex, no-one fits perfectly into a box. None of them are ‘evil’. If you read them all as merely a sadistic child, evil maid and scorned wife then you’re missing out. That’s maybe what made this game stand out for me in the end, all these characters are human and the player is not invited to make sweeping judgements about them.The Mad Father, however, is an easy villain to hate."

THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFULLY TWISTED!In this game you play as a girl named Aya who has a normalish family, from what it seems like at the start of the game. Until one specific night a curse is dropped on your home and everything starts to become hellish. From here you must try to save your father well demons and angry spirits roam about.This game will give you a lot of mixed emotions during it until the very end when three specific ones hit you. First one is a bit of terror. The second one is sadness. Then the third one is. . . WAIT WHAT?!?This game is filled with puzzles and obstacles which will sometimes get you stuck on certain parts of the game for a while until you manage to figure them out. This game also has a unique thing where you will sometimes get caught by a monster or whatever and you'll have to mash certain buttons together to get free. You might get stuck a few times at the start thanks to this but once you get a hang of it than it is fairly easy.In terms of scares this game delivers them. There is a nice little mix of jumpscares and chases which I like. Also well on the topic of jumpscares. This games jumpscares aren't cheap ones. They made me jump a few times. . . okay a lot!This games story is one that you will remember since it is twisted, dark, and even lovely at some parts aswell.Overall I will give this game a 5/5 and highly recommend this to anyone who likes horror games or just really likes suspenseful stories and a good scare."

I'm glad I didn't pass it up -- while you're not going to be jumping out of your skin left and right, this game manages to be *impressively* creepy despite the extreme graphics limitation.  The story is very well written and carries evereything.You won't be killing anything in this game -- enemy encounters are infrequent and invovle you running frantically from these somehow absolutely terrifying fast-moving sprites.The endings I uncovered were each a nice twist as well.  I'm quite satisfied with the story from opening to close.Puzzles are clever and the 8-bit scares have you running for your life.  It's a short but satisfying game that I couldn't put down until I finished it -- I *had* to see what was in the next room all the way through to the end.

It's not as scary as I thought it would be which is a plus. It's kinda short but it's reasonable for the price. Honestly, I would have spent more than the $4.49 I payed for it.The only cons I have for this are;1. The ending was kind of dull for a true ending.2. It's kind of hard at some points but once you figure it out you're good to go.Also; if anyone is stuck I have a walkthrough of the True ending."

Rooms are p dang spooky to explore as you never know what's going to pop out at you and things can shift around from the previous time you've been in one.The story is fairly gripping, it had me wanting to say where the end would take me (and there are several to mess around with).I'd say the most disappointing part overall was the gameplay. I'm not too big on puzzle games (even when the puzzles are pretty easy, like this one). It's not like I can complain; I kind of figured it'd be that way though I figured it more as a 'go around, see set pieces' type of game. Kind of like an adventure visual novel...I was expecting a longer game. Not really complaining about it and it's not exactly the kind of game I'd play againWould I suggest this is a buy? Sure thing. It's got atmoshphere, charm, and a soundtrack which you're bound to love."

It gave me so much Nostalgia solving the little puzzles and collecting all the gems, which I still knew the locations of (hehe).The Steam version features an almost complete make over of the graphics and some new, additional content, which was very fun to play and made the little Mad Father-fan in me jump in circles.Even the little creeps and scares were brought back in this version, which I personally really liked.The Goods:+New In-Game-Graphics, Art and better visual Quality+Good,simple and yet deep Story, which makes you theorise about it, even if you've already made it to the end.+The BGM choices were always well made(Like in the original),buuuuut...+Simple to solve Puzzles and finding hidden Gems+A dark Atmosphere+Horror elements, which make it even more enjoyable+3 Endings (2 Bad, 1 True Ending)+New Content! It has an extra new ""Ending"" which you can unlock by getting all the other Endings I think.+A lot of Nostalgia+Achievements and Trading CardsThe Bads:-Controls are actually fine, but the Stairway and in some other situations it was really difficult to walk on. The main character can get stuck sometimes. (The Stairway is really horrible, ugh)-The music sometimes - depending on the song -  is either too loud or too quiet, which can be annoying sometimes.-New Graphics kinda took away the overall darkness of the house/game.(It seems more bright)-The new Dialogue screen & Character pictures don't seem to fit into to game. I liked the old version's Interface better.-Very short sadly (Playtime for one ending with all Gems is about 2hr -2.5hr)In my opinion it's totally worth buying and supporting the dev and team behind this. It's good they feature new content and it was very fun and nice to replay Mad Father.Let's wait for ""The Witch's House"" next, hehe :)"

The Steam version does not hide this.Let me say this: you don't need to play this game. If you have played the free version which is still available, you are not missing much. You'll get the same enjoyment as you will with this version.With that being said, though, I still recommend it. The story is the same but most of the art is different. The mansion feels more full with the different graphics and some of the things that seemed out of place before have been fixed. The, ""monsters,"" have been changed to look either like people or dolls and one of the test subjects who brought up a lot of questions before now has an explanation behind her.All in all, if you have already played Mad Father, you do not need to play it again if you are just trying to learn something new...

This games story is very good. The game is simple, its a horror game in which you move around and solve puzzles with hints and clues and try to figure out how to get to the next area. The soundtrack is very good, I loved it. The game itself is simple and fun. It was not rage inducing difficult but wasn't overly boring easy either. This game shines with it's story. It's simple at first and doesn't give away too much too fast. It has a good pace. And leaves yu asking the questions till specific moments when you figure out whats really going on. Though for those of us used to the Horror Genre we may be able to figure that out ourselves as it doesn't take rocket science.I encountered different things in each play through, So I am unsure what exactly the differences are and how to achieve them. But I noticed things each time that I did not come acrossed the prior time. This added to its replay value for me as I re-played it through just to see if I could find a hint at what role a certain person who's name I won't mention actually plays. The game will leave you asking questions regarding the story, but will also answer them. Which will also make you ask more questions. It's an interesting story to put it simply. I got the game for 4.99$ and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes horror games and the paranormal / gore intensive stories and games. It was a hidden gem in the 2d horror that I found and I very much loved the game, enough to replay it 3x.10/10 Loved the game."

Now, this is coming from a person who typically avoids playing horror games but loves to watch others play them. I just love Mad Father so much I just freaked out when I saw there was a new remastered version on Steam.Right off the bat I noticed the game looks absolutely gorgeous. The artwork looks a lot cleaner and the sprite work looks much better than it ever did before (though the free version never looked bad either). I went and played this, got all achievements, and noticed just a few things added to the story though they were a very welcome touch. This Remastered version simply polishes up the game and makes it the game it was meant to be by adding the few things it lacked. This version also comes with an ""If"" ending that is really interesting and made for a satisfying conclusion to my playthrough.I absolutely recommend playing this game through the end and if you seem iffy on paying for it, the free version is always an option as it is still available, however this version supports the developers and in the end, provides a nice polished experience you won't get with the free version.A Few Things To Note:I completed this game in 5 hoursAs any horror game, it isn't for everyoneYou can only play this game in a small window, because of this, Steam notifications block a good part of the lower right of the game9/10"

It is a good and enjoyable game that has a few twists in it which come as a surprise.If you are going for 100% than the game will take 3-4 hours, so while it is not a lengthy game I enjoyed every moment I spent in the game and due to its length it is perfect for people who would like a game that they can just pick up and play and beat in a afternoon.While nothing in the game was overly scary and nothing made me jump I would not say that it was the games fault as rpgmaker does have it's limits, but it does not take anything away from the game.It has a good story and some likeable characters, You play the game as Aya, a 11 year old girl that awakens to hear her father screaming and finds a curse has been unleashed on the house and it is now filled with ghosts and dead people brought back to life, Aya braves the horrors of the house to try and find and rescue her father.You have no weapons in the game so you will not be able to kill or fight anything off.I would happily recommend this game to anyone who is a bit curious or interest has been peaked by the video/screenshots on the store page, It is worth it's price in my opinion."

I bought it to support the developer, who had released a number of freeware games back in the day.  But, this game is just terrible.  From the awful and clunky controls, the simplistic and needlessly frustrating puzzles, to the fact that if you're not careful you can get yourself caught in an infinite death loop towards the end of the game.  And to be quite honest, this game has some of the worst sound design and mixing I've ever heard in a game.  In a lazy attempt to get a scare out of the player, it will make certain sounds so ear-piercingly loud that you wish you played with the game on mute.  Including the music that plays when you die...which continues to play after reloading your last save.  Gradually getting louder and louder for no apparent reason, to the point where it actually drowns out the rest of the game for a good 5-10 seconds.  This happens every.  Single.  Time.  Every time you make a mistake, just mute your speakers or take off your headphones, because your eardrums are about to be beaten harder than a pedophile in prison.  On that note, what little voice acting there is will make you cringe so hard that onlookers will believe you to be having some kind of seizure.The story starts of interestingly enough, presenting the player with a unique moral dilemma.  Unfortunately, said dilemma is completely tossed out the window no more than 15 minutes into the game.  Leaving you with one of the most disappointing endings that you'll ever have the misfortune to witness.For crying out loud, don't buy this game.  It's uninspired, dull and downright obnoxious at times."

And the first thing that appeared in there was a blood-covered zombie maid. Far from being frightened or unsettled, my reaction was more like ""Really? Seriously?"" I carried that feeling of mixed contempt and incredulity through the whole game.It felt to me like the writing, the characters, the environmental design, the arbitrary stealth sections where you navigate around murderous dolls... almost everything about this game seemed to be messed up for the sake of being messed up. There is absolutely no subtlety to the horror, from beginning to end. Mad Father does not have a good buildup of tension like there is in, say, Oxenfree or Fran Bow. Well-designed horror starts with small, unsettling things and gradually works up to the unspeakable horrors. MF threw the horrors at me within the first 30 minutes, and with that as a baseline I quickly got used to seeing blood and mutilated bodies all over the place. I wasn't frightened, like I have been in any number of other horror adventure games - just tense and annoyed.You go from one too-easy puzzle to the next, broken up by segments where an inexplicable monster will try to kill you. You learn more about the messed up characters - and almost all of them are messed up, not just the titular Mad Father (someone has a murder fetish! Try to guess who! :D ). Eventually, you learn a secret that could have been telegraphed all the way from the prologue. And there are jump scares all the way.The only thing I thought was good about the game were the visual effects. The random spooky things that happen in the background as you wander through the mansion and is 4-5 basement levels were generally well done. Perhaps if the game had relied more on those than on killer jumpscares, it would have made for a more compelling experience. But as it is, it feels more to me like I *endured* a game than played one."

,Recommended,483980,30484046,Posted: 12 March,all,LadySpiritWolf,"I loved this game! It's a great horror rpg game <3. The horror aspect comes from the storyline, the enemies that chase you in some areas, and the grosteque environment around you.It is a simple plateform game where you move the character with the arrow keys and use the action key to interact with the environment around you. The enemies you face you must run away, or outsmart, and you will die if they attack you. You will die a lot in this game if not careful.The puzzles range from simple to one or two that I needed help with, but it's nothing impossible to solve. Some puzzles require quick reflexes of the fingers to get past, while others are simple of combining objects to get past.I won't give away any spoilers, but the storyline is very interesting, maybe a little bit predictable in some ways, and there are multiple endings that you can achieve. A reminder that this is a horror story so be aware the endings will be shockers. I personally enjoyed the storyline and I was shocked to find out the true motive behind why this is all happening.I recommend this game to anyone who loves horror plateformers. I was always creeped out by dolls, now I can't stop thinking about this game when I see them lol."

,Recommended,483980,27811288,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,✰Lime✰,"Mad Fatheris a horror game made with Wolf RPG Editor (not RPG Maker!) that was originally released in 2012 as freeware. So is it worth buying when you can play it for free? I'd say yes! While there weren't a lot of changes from the free version, they're at least big enough to be worth paying for. You can check the first update for the full list of changes, but basically most of the graphics were updated, new scenes were added and some aspects of the gameplay were changed.As for the game itself, it’s one of the better examples of its little sub-genre. The plot and characters aren’t super complex, but they do have a B-movie charm to them. The art is well drawn, and its huge character portraits set it apart from similar games. The puzzles are clever without being too difficult. It’s also an easy game to 100%, if you care about that.Unfortunately, it’s on the short side; completing it takes around 2 - 3 hours, maybe 4 if you decide to get all of the achievements. While the Steam version used to have a lot of bugs the publisher, Playsim, has been diligent about fixing them. My only major complaint is that some of the sound effects are too loud, such as Aya's scream when you get a game over, but according to the updates this might have been fixed? I wouldn't turn your sound up all the way just in case.Overall,Mad Fatheris definitely worth playing if you like indie horror games. You should also playMisao, which is by the same creator, if you haven't already. (It currently isn't on Steam but I would totally buy it if it were.)Pros:Entertaining (if cheesy) story and charactersNice character artCreative puzzlesHas achievements and trading cardsCons:ShortSound effects can be loud"

The game mechanics are easy, the soundtrack is nice, the character design is nice and overall I really enjoyed this updated version compared to the old free verzion of mad father. There are a few major differences for example Art, Textures and smoother controls.As far as story goes it isn't the most complex story and overall I would say it's short if you know how to do everything it takes roughly 2 - 4 hours to beat, if you're playing blind I'd estimate 3 - 6.  However despite how short it is I would say it's worth the price tag.The story is about girl named Aya who lives with her father and her father's assistant, they grieve over the loss of aya's mother who passed away sometime ago.

The game has the underlying theme of spooky and horror, but it being scary can differ greatly for various people. There were a few jump scares in the game, but it wasn't too bad. The game even forewarns you ... so you have been warned if you scare easily.To the game! You play as Aya and you will start with some instructions on how to play the game. The story plot of the game isn't rich like final fantasy games, but it is quite rich and fantastic for how long the game is. I played the first time around and got true ending after 2 hours, then spent another hour collecting all of the achievements. I could not resist finding out what happened in Aya's past or what will happen to Aya as the game progresses. For two hours straight, I just kept playing and did not stop at all. The puzzle factors are interspersed into the game and I think it has a pretty good balance, Some are hard and some are easy. What was really nice is how forgiving the game can be. You are rarely pressured into making reflex responses and even if you fail them, the game has save points right before all of those events. So, even if you fail, you can just load your save slot and try until you get past it. Even more so if you are attempting achievement completion, the save spots are very convenient for you to do it quickly. Another nice factor in this game is the exclaimation points when you reach a point where you can interact with something/someone. Instead of forcing you to just click on everything, you can focus less on that and more on the game (highly appreciate that). To which brings to point, the details in this game. I highly praise the developer(s) on this, because it appears to me much thought and details went into the game (despite it being a short JRPG). There is a decent amount of exploration in the game and details you have to pay attention to if you want to be a completionist.Despite the positive factors I have mentioned earlier, some things did pop up to me as minor negatives. 1) The exclaimation mark popping up despite the event has already passed and 2) at the true ending scene, I'm left with a confused moment, because I'm not sure how should I take that ending. Is it actually a bad ending despite it being a ""good"" ending. If there is going to be a sequel to this game, I hope that question gets answered and the sequel will be as good or better than this current game.Overall, this is a good game that I would recommend for anybody that loves a good RPG with puzzle factors without long grinding monsters. 8.5/10!"

But I didn't know anything beyond that.With that in mind, I've never heard of this game until very recently. I sat on this game for a while before playing it, and now that I have, I can honestly say I almost shed a tear. (somehow, I did not..)This game is set in what I guess is a somewhat super-natural type settings, but isn't at the same time. You play as an eleven year-old girl, Aya Drevis. Her father is a mad scientist doing some questionable experiments until things go very, very wrong. It is your quest to save your father from death from some unknown force.Although the game looks dated, I actually find some charm in it as a retro gamer. The artwork is beautifully done and the puzzles actually do require a bit of time to figure out. What is missing though, in my personal opinion, is a bit more on the creepy music. That would set a more menacing tone in certain areas. However, by no means should that be a let-down. With what minimal voices there are (mainly Aya's and her father's), the sounds in general are interesting to say the least.It is very short for a game, but it is well worth the $5. It is available for free, but the Steam version does have some extra benefits and a more updated engine if I'm not mistaken. With this in mind, I would highly recommend giving this game a go for those who do love a horror-mystery type of setting.Now my quest to 100% of the game. May even shed a tear because of the feels.

That says a lot in itself, and the fact that me and my brother can play this and get scared every time we play (well at least I do) makes it the best for me.Okay, now onto the emotional part. As you play you begin to learn more about each character, making you grow attached. Now this may seem bad, because they're fictional, but it helps you understand the game and in my case cry when something sad happens get mad when they get mad become happy for them when something good happens to them and feel like you are there to see it all happen and I mean like be there. With Aya, Monika, whatever the father's name is, Maria, Dio/Blonde Youth, Ogre, and all the experiments (such as Collina, Collina's mom, and Ines).For the artistic side of this game I have to say it is well done. Me being a big fan of anime and being an artist myself, the art draws my attention and everytime I see it I think ""The artist behind all of this is very gifted and talented."" The music is also great. The music itself could probably tell a story and you wouldn't even have to play the game.The backstory of the game is greate and grabs the player's attention very easily. When my brother suggested we play this as the next game we complete, he told me the whole story and I immediatley jumped up from my seat and said ""TAKE MY MONEY, JUST GET THE GAME!"" Now I know I sound childish but what do you expect from an otaku? I mean look at Akidearest, Misty/Chronexia, The Anime Man, and Lost Pause!Overall I find this is a great game for anyone who is not weak hearted or is not big on the horror genra.

,Recommended,483980,31284220,Posted: 21 April,all,m.ike,"At $5 you really can't go wrong picking this up, hell honestly, I'd pay $10 for it even though it only took me a bit over 2 1/2 hours to beat myself, though I'm great with puzzle games, so your mileage may vary compared to mine.You essentially play a 10-year-old girl in a fancy mansion, when she goes to bed, you wake up to a much different mansion full of horrors, etc.When consulting this review please take in mind I have never heard of this game before today, and therefore I have yet to have played it before it came to PC.GAMEPLAY: 8/10: Excellent with good and easy controls and lots of puzzles, though some may be too easy.The gameplay is quite excellent in that the controls are very simple and easy to learn and quite responsive, and the puzzles are pretty nice, albiet a bit easy for most people's tastes if you ask me. You will need to backtrack from time to time, but this back tracking always comes with minor to major changes in whatever room or rooms you're going back through, which makes it both worth it and a bit creepy to continue on.GRAPHICS: 8.5/10: Excellent and detailed visuals with only minor complaints.I'm a huge fan of games that have that good old fashioned RPG Maker VX feel and this one nails it whilst being detailed and unique enough to where it looks far beyond the quality of what most people are capable of making in said program. I do not have any real major gripes with the graphics with the exception of two things: I feel that the character portraits being a bit low-res/pixelated is a bit of a distraction, and I feel like the sprites, especially of Aya's(the girl's) sprite, should have had more expressions (pupils shrinking during fear, etc.) But these issues are probably just a bit of pickiness on my part, and it may just have been tricky with the sprites' resolutions.STORY: 8.5/10: Too short for my tastes, but if it were extended, I'd pay many times more! It's great to me.The story is solid and quite enjoyable and suspenseful, albeit a bit predictable. They go over backstories and flashbacks and explain most of what you want or need to know, with the best ending (yes there's multiple endings) being quite the treat. Overall, quite solid. What keeps it from going above the 8.5 however is that it is short, like really short. Don't get me wrong, movies are only an hour and a half long most of the time, so compared to the playtime I got my money's worth. IF the creator decides to release a sequel, I would absolutely buy it. If the game were re-released to have a 8-12 hour or longer story, I would pay $30+ for it.SOUND: 9/10: Plenty of high-quality sound effects and some voice acting!The soundtrack is a bit small but fits the mood and atmosphere. Along with this, there is voice acting for grunting/moaning/screaming, as well as a bit of voice acting for the Father that absolutely makes the game reach its potential much more smoothly. There is no noticable bad quality anywhere in the audio and there's plenty of sound effects for all the events and things you may do in the game. The only thing keeping this from being a 10/10 is that in some cases the music will straight up stop for a bit (though this may be intentional?), and I wouldn't have minded a bit more music for the background. Not a huge issue at all though.VALUE: 11/10: For just $5 you get a game that's sure to be a memorable one.Where can you pay the equivalent of a hot lunch at a burger joint for a well made game that's more than worth playing for puzzle and horror fans? Right here you can. I really don't have too much to say for this category, it's an excellent value, and I wouldn't have minded paying $7-$10 for it even if it's short. There is replayability though, in that there are multiple endings and some extra details to be found.OVERALL: 9/10 - Highly recommended!"

As she travels through the house, she realizes that her father held some secrets and what kind of a man he is, and soon finds out the truth behind her mother's death.I'm happy that an updated version has been released. My hope is that Sen will be able to do the same with Misao in the future."

It was a little short but overall there were so many small things that get missed the first time, it's worth playing a 2nd time. Plus finding all the gems will keep you busy along with the alternate endings. I personally would love to see another game made."

The storyline was very unique and detailed along with well thought out backstories for the characters. It was kinda scary (on a scale of 1/10, I'd give the horror factor a 4) but still very good. If you like spooky rpg games, it's definetly worth a buy."
76561198004484646,Recommended,483980,29097130,Posted: 7 January,all,Xelatross,"Mad Father is a small horror game set in the focus of a little girl named Aya, who had a fairly happy life with her loving family. However, this definitely isn't your normal family. Aya's father carries the title of a scientist, who works primarily on humans he picks off the street. He nurishes them, gains their trust, and soon tortures them to madness, killing them in the end. Later on, Aya's mother dies of sickness, and Aya is left with just her father and her assisstant. But the dread isn't over yet, for Aya's mother returns, and with a curse to boot. The curse turns Aya's mansion into a horror house filled with all the tortured souls of Father's experiements, back for revenge. Aya's mission is to save her father from her angered mother, no matter the danger.I truly enjoyed this game. The game basically tells you the beginning, then throws you in, saying, ""Go ahead, explore"". And the more you explore, the more you find out just what horrors your father's experiments contained. The puzzles are not hard, but do require some brain power to figure out. Plus, the game rewards you for exploring and wanting to know more on just what the hell happened to everything.The game mainly focuses on exploration and puzzles. Whether it's finding the right tool in the nearby toilet, or trying to capture a cleaver-weilding madman while not getting your body diced, this game does a good job in being tense and puzzling.The sprite art is well done, along with the music and sound design. Nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done.All in all, I liked this game. If you like a good 4 hour horror game with a neat story, spooky interactions with experiments gone wrong, and good ol' fashioned puzzles, you may like this game too."

But this is a shining example that 3D graphics and fancy gameplay mechanics are needed to tell an amazing story. Mad father is a Horror Adventure game. In the vein of IB and Misao. But i found those games a bit slow for my tastes. Mad father wastes no time creeping you out. Everything from twisted abominations to tortured souls make up the scares in this gem of a game. I bought it thinking ""Hey, it's 5 bucks, I know it's been free for the longest time online; Let me support the Developer. I wound up playing for almost 3 hours upon my inital purchase. This game is great. Music is top notch, with gothic droning tunes and ambient chamber music. The standing points of this game are 2 things. The Narrative and atmosphere. Let me be frank here, this isn't a game you're going to play for the gameplay, this is a game that you're going to enjoy for the story and ambiance.  Gameplay consists of typical adventure game item puzzles and a few oddly placed stealth sections.TL;DR Amazing story and atmosphere, not much gameplay."

The story always has and always will be thrilling; the art is beautiful and it is overall an amazing game!In this version compared to the RPG maker version the sprites have been replaced with smoother and more detailed ones, some dialogs have been added/edited, and some actions are different; but even then it is still probably one of the best RPG maker games out there next to Ib and Witch's House! Thank you for this amazing game, and I know it probably won't happen because of how old this game is but I would absolutely love to see a sequel!"
