When they get too close you can't really shoot them.(At least I've struggled to do so)So any chance of adding a bat, crow bar, or simply push with the other hand to get space?They've Added Melee!  Great!"

Really gives you a sense of scale.  It's easy to lose yourself with teleportation, I really appreciate this slow walk (with limitted sprint) locomotion.  Creeping through a dark church with my flashlight, checking pews for supplies, looking behind me periodically for zeds...Very good stuff.Needs optimization.  Lots of frame loss in certain scenes, like looking at the ocean at spawn.edit: There have been at least 5 updates and every one of them has improved performance.  It's nearly 100% stable now!Once you learn the controls, and figure out the UI for ammo, and learn the location of weapons, and figure out how sprint works...it's a lot of fun.  You have tons of ammo.  30 clips for your pistol at the start.  Go hammo on the ammo.  There's an additional 15 or so clips by the huddled dudes at the start.  Take it or leave it but once you engage it will never really stop.  I've only found the shotgun and AK."

You are on a small island and you are free to go wherever you like. There are about 5 different types of locomotion you can choose from, even the omni treadmill is supported, if you're lucky enough to have one. There is a story mode, and arcade mode...where you basically get swarmed by more and more zombies until you can't handle that many and die (this mode also has a leaderboard for players kill count). There is also a small mini game like a duck hunt, and a gun range/shooting range that let's you play with each of the many weapons.Graphically the game is pretty good, the zombies look good, and there are a decent amount of variations between zombie types. Animations on the zombies are also good, as are the sounds they make.Audio is what you'd expect, with decent enough sounds for the weapons, zombies & ambient noises. The story mode has an actor voice over narration which is decent. It's not going to win an Oscar, but it's certainly not bad.Weapons are pretty good, and there is a large selection for your perusal. Everything from handguns, to assault rifles, shotguns, Katanas and even a bow and arrows are there waiting for you to play with. Very satisfying using the bow and katana. ;)Environment is decent enough, and whilst the island that you play on is not huge, it is large enough and does the job. Would i like it to be bigger? Sure, i'd love a much bigger environment, but this is VR and some sacrifices have to be made. The devs have talked about maybe adding more chapters and i think more playable areas, so this COULD potentially make the game much bigger. We'll have to wait and see.It's a single player game for the moment, but co-op mode has been confirmed and will no doubt be available in the coming weeks/months...so can't wait for that!As for the developers, personally i can't fault them. They listen to their community, listen to what people want fixed or changed...and they do it. I have reported bugs and small errors in the game upon discovering them, and literally the next day i got a message from the devs thanking me, and a new build was pushed to steam with these problems fixed.I would recommend this game without a doubt, for £15 it has more content and replayability than a lot of VR games i have bought in the past."

You can see some great potential, but there are many items that need ironed out and many parts that need put in for this to be a great game.For the current sale rate it was worth it to me to be able to actually walk around an area and know that zombies could be hiding behind any door.I'm really looking forward to how this game improves.  At full price, I'd probably wait a few weeks and see if the developers are going to flesh this game out. Right now with the sale, I'm willing to roll the dice - I think the odds of a promising game here are good.  Hats off to the developers for not throwing this game out there for 20 bucks.  If they build it up it could be worth that easily. I've no problem supporting developers with a clear vision that want to get their product out there for feedback and then raise the price after it has truely improved to a worthwhile finished product.Good luck devs! and rock this game out please, it has the bones of a fun game."

The weapons are well done and I love the reload mechanics in the game. And it is set a price I believe any early access game should be for VR right now and it's even on sale for 6 dollars so there is no reason you shouldn't buy it.The movement may disorient you AT FIRST but after 2 or 3 minutes you adjust and it is probably my prefered movement over teleportation.VERY frequent updates so far, the map as well looks very expansive as I can tell they are still working to expand it. 10/10 would fall over from a scary zombie again."
76561197971650483,Recommended,484350,31893282,Posted: 21 May,all,badhras,"Bottom line: Using the Virtuix Omni treadmill with this game is a blast on Arcade mode. Dual-wielding sub machine guns while running and gunning with 5000 rounds of ammo is so much fun. Story mode still needs work: not enough ammo to survive as a loud gunner but zombies always find you even if you're quiet and stealthy.I bought this game because I have a Virtuix Omni and HTC Vive, and it's one of the few games that natively supports the Omni treadmill for VR locomotion. I have no idea how this game plays in roomscale or sitting modes.My primary complaints right now have to do with how story mode plays in terms of its meta. Game doesn't give enough ammo for the player to be a loud gunner. This would be fine if the game actually provided better stealth mechanics and allowed the player to hide or stay safe. Even with the flashilight off and standing still, the horde of zombies will always find the player. At night, the zombie count turns to 11 and surviving just amounts to a whole lot of running away. Yes, it's realistic in that manner, but it's not terribly fun because there's really not much of a reward for surviving another night other than getting supplies in your safehouse. Even then, supply drops for weapons you don't have is a pretty unfortunate reward for surviving, which has happened to me. Safehouse isn't much of a safehouse unless there's fuel to keep the door closed.I expect my complaints will eventually issued. The developers actively take feedback and improving the game. To this end, I can at least recommend the game for its Arcade mode."

After getting the pistol I had no idea what to do or where to go.-It could definitely use some optimization but that's not a deal breaker.-And another thing that kind of bothers me is that your guns feel so weak even though they aren't. I'm talking like the firing noise and it's very hard to tell if you even hit them, let alone where. As with every survival horror your supposed to feel weak and what not, but I would rather that translate to scarce ammo low batteries  etc, I would like to feel that as long as I can keep calm and have a few bullets I can have some kind of power.And for the good+the developer has made huge progress with the last few updates and is very into the community, he's on practically all of the discussion boards answering questions and responding to praise/criticism, and most importantly is listening to the community.+the idea for this game is very good and it is definitely a work in progress but is heading in the right direction.+The narrator is very well done+it's actually very creepy. The first time I heard the screaming runners I almost pooped alittle.+I really like the mystery of everything, what's going on, where are you, who's the voice in your head, etc.An idea that I would love to see is to put back that sandbox style before these recent updates as a game mode, at least until the game gets further in development.TL;DR-bugs-no direction+great developer/community relationship+pretty creepy/downright scary+good looking future+great updatesEdit:controls are much bettersave system implementedmuch better performanceThanks dev!"

First this is a early access game but don't let that scare you away as the developer is updating this title at a rapid pace and more importantly is listening to the players.~ Visuals are great. Scenery, weapon skins, etc...~ Sound is decent. Some weapons seem a bit off (Shotgun seems quiet) while others are pretty spot on.~ Motion - you have two options A. Locomotion (Which works well with the occoasional hicup while running) B.     Teleportation (Works as you expect it)It is a good solid Zombie survival game that appears to keep getting better with each update. For $6.29 (Edit - it is now $8.99 and it is still worth it.) it is a no brainer... pick it up.What I would like to see is co-op play. That is a must and should work really well."

They listen to the community make changes Where needed.To get the best experience Read the PDF File its very helpful.If you are looking for a game to buy make sure this is at the top of your list.
,Recommended,484350,23529532,"Posted: 12 June, 2016",all,Krenath,"This is going to be my very favorite game.  I can see that already.When you appear in the game, it's just after sunset and the sun is going down.  As you progress, it gets darker and darker and the zombies get harder and harder to see and the tension builds.  All you have with you is a pistol with light mounted on it, your cellphone and a wristwatch to help you to survive and to find other tools and weapons.The feel of the game is amazing.  It's so intense being in the dark, stalked by the zombies, creeping from place to place hoping to find weapons or first aid before the zombies find you first.Even though this is an early-access game, you can see that massive amounts of effort has gone into detailing the world around the player.Not all of those areas and buildings are entirely accessible yet, but being surrounded in all that detail rather than a flat backdrop and having them just out of your reach, that just makes it all the more mysterious and interesting, because from where you are, you can clearly see that they're fully detailed and waiting for you to be able to get out of the central starting area and explore.I believe this game is a VR engine being put together with a fully-detailed and expansive map from a previous non-VR game by the same developers.  There's a wide world out there, apparently.Weapon detail in the game is incredible.  The surface detail looks just a bit too shiny, like someone took a much-used and much-loved rifle and clear-coated it.  Other than that they're flawless.  Reloading is not as fiddly as with some games, and if you're having trouble reloading, it's probably because you lost track of magazines and ran out.   Run!The controls are still being adjusted, so it's possible to perform actions  that you didn't intend at the moment, but they're still in flux and changes are frequent.  What problems you might have today might be gone tomorrow.Discussions in the Steam forums about this game are very active and very busy.  A sure sign that many people love this game and are really anxious to see it develop and unfold."

It's very much a work in progress, as the devs attest to, but this is the only game that I've played that doesn't use the teleport mechanic and plods you along the path you chose. (Careful. It can make you motion sick. But you do get used to the floor moving without you moving.)After that, there's both good and bad. It's unfinished, by a large margin. Ammo and guns, at the current time, seem to be limited to the immediate square acre of space you start in. Zombies spawn in this same limited area. This makes restarting a little tedious. There's no ""pain"" mechanic, so you don't know when you're taking damage. (Heartbeat, red tinged vingette.) Replayability is good, but I expect once random spawn for guns and ammo as well as more actual story will add a lot to the game. Objectives like ""get in, get evidence, get out"" or just ""get out"" and the like would be fun takes on the game.This isn't just another ""Me, too. I can VR."" gallery or on-rails shooter, which is nice. Can't wait for more polish and experimentation. Devs. Toss us some updates and we'll let you know what we like!

All I can say right now is you need to go in with the expectation that its going to take a few tries to not fail on the first night. Keep exploring. You are likely to die multiple times before making it very far.If you're running a 970 I wouldn't expect to play over medium.Some menu UI buttons aren't toggled correctly.The reload system for the pistol is one of two things. Haven't tried any other weapons yet. Auto reload; grip to drop mag, grip to load mag. Or manual; grip with non-dominant hand to spawn mag in said hand. Move it close to the gun to load. Works well. I especially like it when I grip and release 50 times a second trying to reload for an incomming horde.As far as open world zombie games for the Vive go, this is as good as it gets short of Arizona Sunshine (which is linear as a line in comparison to this).

Upon launching game, you start in a barren room that seems to try to combine a tutorial, game settings, and a ton of weapons you can't use strewn across the floor. When you hit the trigger you'll hear a weird zombie growl and it will put you in whatever zombie world this is. The environment seemed interesting at first, and then as you go through all the buildings you never unravel anything about some greater ""mystery"" this game claims to hold -- you just mow down zombies that all look and behave exactly the same with a pistol that sounds like Goldeneye 64's PP7 until you run out of ammo and inevitably die a death that is so profoundly uneventful, you wouldn't know you're dead unless text appeared on the screen telling you it happened.. SPOILER ALERT: It does.I realize there are other weapons somewhere on the map, but the game is nowhere near compelling enough for me to even care about finding them. The only ""alien"" is a lethargic UFO in the sky, the aiming is undeniably flawed, and the physics/hit detection are just simply weird and not satisfying as they are in The Brookhaven Experiment.Half of me wants to keep this game around to see what updates are made, but I see none have been released since June, and then I think of other games I could get with a refund."

It is has huge issues and problems, even more so then the earlier release. Its almost as if youve just tried cramming in everything you wanted without playtesting it.Firstly, this was meant to be a zombie game, hence its best if you keep it as a zombie game, and forget doing silly things like adding ghosts and spirits. The first time i saw the ghost appear, i was like what is this crap?! Adding monsters etc.. is fine, also i remember before the zombies used to react much better to gun shots? or maybe its because ive played loads of good games since the first release you had. But now shooting them just feels wierd and doesnt give proper feedback, especially the dreadful crawling headless corpses, which is just silly aswell, they take up a whole clip and every shot that hits them just feels like its not.I also hate the fact, that your just spawning countless amounts of zombies all the time, they just keep coming and coming. Start off slow, then build it up. Let the player ease into the game. I had a whole army of zombies on me within 5mins of playing the game, after that i just gave up and shut it down as i stood no chance. To be honest i would prefer fixed number of zombies per level, instead of none ending respawns for each day.I have a gtx1080, and have most of my pc maxed out with the hardware, i tried playing the game on ultra, but it was very unplayable! Juddery, low frames etc.. What sort of hardware is the ULTRA mode designed for? Maybe next time i will try playing it on one setting down.i see youve added some fixes in a new patch, especially with pickups etc. Thats great stuff, will hopefully try it out soon or maybe just wait for a few more patches to fix things up.But seriously, get rid of the silly things like ghosts and the crawlers, or fix them up!Keep up the good work,youve done a nice job refreshing the whole level, it was still poor performing but it looked very nice :) Hopefully the one setting down can fix my performance issues."

In detail, the 'new' 'natural movment' or w/e they are calling it is totally unatural to your brain, as it feels as though a conveyor belt just started up and your on it. Or like you are sliding on ice, and then abruptly stopping makes you lose your balance for a second for no reason at all besides your brain creating a placebo effect. Sure you can get used to it I guess. After about 5 minutes or so the strange feeling weakens. But then the whole moving around with a sliding effect still blows. The 2X movement speed is too slow and that is the max. At regular speed you are tip-toeing around very slowy. In a zombie infested place I wouldnt reccomend moving very slowly especially when zombies are after you. Anyhow I felt the whole thing was a damn mess. Also the teleport is BROKEN, it has some kind of wind-up time. ""Tele-loading"" that doesnt even work half the time. Even got this in a price slash, still want my money back. So I really cannot recommend this."

At first it feels strange and I felt like I was going to fall over, but eventually you get past the motion sickness and come to enjoy the gameplay the locomotion offers.The guns are nice, I love it when I shoot a zombie and see them ragdoll to the ground.The Hud is creative and immersive, as it's on your wrist-watch, but I wish there was a way to have a hud that floats a couple feet away from my face and shows my stamina, ammo, and weapons all in one area.Graphics are nice, game is demanding. I have a GTX 970 and play it at about 45 FPS constantly with some really low settings. I play on getting a graphics card in the 1000 series soon so I'm not going to complain about optimization.Frequent updates, which is great.Now I wasn't sure if this is a negative or a positive to me, but it's really difficult to find guns. I'm now coming to realize that the difficulty of finding the weapons is actually a pretty good thing as it encourages players to memorize the area and frequently re-play. My first couple rounds were extremely difficult. When you run out of ammo, you're done for and there's nothing you can do.

Not instant like in many other games.There is no real story and it's just move and survive basically but hopefully that will change. There is only one type of zombie and the UFO seems a little silly.

It's definitely playable, but I think it'll get significantly better/less confusing/better UI/etc.tl;dr: Shooter/wave game that allows for wide area of exploration, but jittery and somewhat confusing; however, I'm looking forward to its future iterations.When playing the game stuttered rather frequent for me (running an r9 390x with an i6600k) and it really broke immersion and caused me to feel a little sick. For example, I'd turn around and it would jump a little/wouldn't be smooth and was a little disorienting. Paired with this, there is a lack of direction.

Even if it's just like ""there's an arms cache in the church.. maybe I should try and find my way there.""Suggestions:- Perhaps a stealth-like mode. If we're exploring maybe give us the option to crouch and move slower, but quieter w/o drawing a horde and only stumbling upon certain zombies. Perhaps a silencer option, dimming of light, etc. option to pair with this.- Some kind of direction when starting the game. Maybe a text to the cell phone? I understand it's a wave game, but the description alludes to a story, but right now I have no idea what's occurring.- The phone UI itself is alright, but the mapping to the touchpad is a little off. I'm having trouble holding it on the bottom right/left ""apps."" Perhaps make these full screen and click on the touchpad (as if it were a dpad whether left/right or one click in any direction brings you to the app positioned there) to rotate through them (think this would be easier selection and easier to read)."

The teleportation system is far too slow for a game that relies on speed to survive due to time restainsts and fast running zombies. Other FPS allow for unlimited, speedy teleporting.-You should be able to carry atleast one med pack. Current you can't carry any.-It would be amazing if you could access the demo from the menu in the paid version because it is hard to get the hang of reloading new weapons and the demo allows for practice, which is needed in this game.-An in-game map would be so very helpful.Game glitches:- Sometimes I respawn 10 feet above the ground and have to exit the entire game.- If im not careful I can also end up 30 feet below water. The teleportation arrow shouldn't even allow you to point it over water. Other games restrict teleportation to certain areas, this is needed.- While in teleport mode only, objects you try to touch streach away from you, making it hard to interact with the game and also nauseating. This does not happen in trackpad mode, however, that mode makes me sick after about 10 mins.- If you try to pick up a third weapon the first weapon that you picked up disappears altogether, it would be better if it just fell to the ground so you could locate it later. In the demo you could carry many more weapons, that was excellent.This would be a decent game otherwise. Honestly I would get a refund but it was only about 8 dollars, so i'll keep it and wait for these things to be updated, which I really hope they are. Thank you."

Even with all the graphical settings as low as they go, my GTX970 can't keep this game at an enjoyable frame-rate. The difficulty skyrockets so quickly that in a matter of minutes you're surrounded by more zombies than you have bullets for. While I enjoy a hard game, the movement and hitboxes feel too clunky for this game to feel fair. As of now, this game is not really fun or unique. I look forward to future updates. Hopefully I can change my recommendation soon.UPDATE: The updates are starting to add some depth to the game, but it's still not quite at a point where I get much enjoyment out of playing. Every attempt feels like a speedrun. Your first few playthroughs are only for exploring the map. You aren't going to get anything done until you know where everything is and can start optimizing your route from the start. Navigating around also seems like a chore. Very soon into a run, you realize that shooting most zombies is futile. They'll spawn directly on top of you and in uncontrollable numbers, so just keep moving. Since you should know where everything is beforehand, this quickly devolves into a herding simulator. The whole feeling of the game is lost after that moment. I should also note that finding an acceptable performance setting is no longer an issue on my GTX1080."
,Not Recommended,484350,30025507,Posted: 18 February,all,Veraxus,"VRZ Torment is one of the few games I know of that has native Virtuix Omni support, so no special configuration or animal sacrifices are necessary... unfortunately, some of the design decisions are not Omni-compatible, which is hilarious since the game includes a commercial license specifically for VR arcades that intend to use the game with an Omni.For instance, the first items your encounter in the game are either lying on the ground or inside a crate that is also on the ground. Obviously, if you are using the Omni treadmill you are strapped upright into one of the most magnificent achievements of VR technology, so bending over and literally plucking an item off the ground is a no-go. Nevertheless, the game does NOT include a point-and-pickup mechanic... it expects you lean over and pluck the item off the actual ground... so instead, all you can do is stand there looking at those weapons on the ground and... do nothing with them because they are physically out of your reach.And don't get me started on the jittery rendering bugs. This game is just a bomb, through-and-through."

The conveyor belt motion made me nauseous if I was looking in a different direction. I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to load / reload the gun. There wasn't a zombie around for 5 minutes. I think you need to make the game more intuitive, faster paced, and slow down the conveyor belt (or just turn off the motion and let us teleport to where we want to go). I'm glad I purchased the game to support the developer but I was really hoping for a cross between HordeZ and the Brookhaven Experiment. Perhaps as the game matures it will get better. If so, I'll change my recommendation."

The locomotion is pitiful working only half the time as it seems only a small portion of the trackpad is used for movement plus the character seems to get stuck on literally nothing when moving around. There are no tutorials or instructions which means you must figure out what each button does as well as pull your hair our when trying to pull levels or pour gas as neither seems to be possible (even though it obviously must be for game progression.This game looked promising and I was very much looking forward to it but have been forced to request a refund. Once these bugs and issues have been rectified I might consider purchasing it again but for now it's unplayable and useless."

The concept of the game is what drove me to make a purchase. Graphics are decent for VR and thats where in my opinion  the game does good. The movement of the player is super choppy/laggy in responce to the touch controls, I would press to move foward but start moving sideways instead. I could not figure out how to make my player run beacuse there is no directions on how or what to do once you start in the game. After about ten or so minutes of playing and figuring out what I was doing I walked in to a barn and was flooded by 20-30 zombies that seemed to be glitched/bugged when walking because the feet dont even move. My handgun did nothing and felt way under powered even when aming for the head. There are some major bugs to be worked out of this game still and some that just brake you out of the vr experience. If the Devolper works hard enough this game does have potential! Overall 2 out of 5.After a few months without stepping back into this so called VR Game the devs really wanted me to try it out again. I re-installed started it up and again ended up back here writing a second review on the same grabage game as before. Still very poor touch controls when moving you have to press then release then re-press the touch controls just to move in the direction your looking, there is no sliding motion to make you move in that direction. Graphics are laggy and choppy the entire time in the game world. I like the addition of grass they added that completely starts to dissapear as you move along lol. The gun controls or any weapon are just plain shi**y, the lack of actual effort in this game is very present through out playing. The game enviroment is flat out stupid there is no actual point that i feel like this is even a game. Anyone who reviews this game as good does not know what VR games are. DO NOT PURCHASE this game if that is even what you can call it. I got a free key after returning it the first time and i still uninstalled it. Devs you have alot of work ahead of you to even get this trash to a point you can even call it a game. The lack of actual effort is apparent in this title and you really need to stop taking money for this to line your pockets with, maybe invest it into some school or employees that can actually make a decent video game.  Please do not respond asking me to come back again, i will not continue to try a game that goes nowhere after month of so called updates. Good luck with this pile."

So far it is not enjoyable though, I get bad frame jitters when looking in some areas, and the scale is off, the weapons and the zombies are way too large.I will keep checking back as it is updated as I'm sure it will get better."

Other then that the game is fun to play. Sound is descent and graphic is good. The weapons is the main attraction of any zombie game and so far the weapons look outstanding but wish there was a way to see how many bullets are left in current magazibe/clip. Still fun and is a nice change of pace."

Only complaint that you when EA a bit too soon, but whatever you most likly need the cash early.This game is now worth the cash, went from not so hot, to heating up.  Some wok still to do, but i would keep an eye on this one as it will prove to be a fun game one fully completeGood job dev team"

So long as they actually get enough support to finish the game properly this will be a must have for anybody who likes a spooky atmosphere that doesn't rely on jumpscares to get your heart going."
