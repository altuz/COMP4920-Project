Boxed into the back of our base, I hear my team mates talking to people in their room, slowly figuring out the game, just as I did. I was the only one paiting, just barely holding the fort, hoping they figure it out (I don't have a mic). Then it clicks.I'm in the back of the base trying to clear up the enemy teams paint when I hear, ""We got your back bro lets do this."" Just minutes earlier I heard the same dudes say ""oohh that's how you move."" I decide to trust him and I went for it, I moved up behind a barrier, knowing that I'd be in danger. I duck behind the barrier and paint while blind firing my pistol over my head. I'm feeling the pressure, but next thing I know it there is a team mate with a shield infront of me. He moved just in time because a hail of bullets and lasers start hitting his shield. I lean to my right and happen to have a perfect shot on the enemy and land a head shot.I pop back behind the barrier and look behind me, there's my team mate on the other side of the barrier, he had my ♥♥♥♥in' back! Everyone in the room is dead but us. The once clueless guy says over the mic, ""Move up!."" I moved up and began painting our path to victory, slowly and methodicly. We boxed the enemy team into their base, just as we were 30 minutes prior, except we were able to seal the deal for the win.That was one of the best moments of team play I've experienced. I played baseball for 18 years of my life, as well as about 5 years of organized highly competitive gaming in team focused games (Team Fortress Classic and CS), that 1 hour was the most team play I've had playing any kind of game.I wish I could've got those guys names, but after it happened I just had to set the Vive down and tell someone about how much fun I just had."

It uses the teleportation method of locomotion that you're used to, but you can only teleport to spaces that your team has painted with special ""paint guns"" that you can hold in your off-hand. This makes for a lot of creative play, and map control becomes extremely important.The developer is very active, dedicated, and works and plays with the community often, especially through the Discord channel and Steam discussion boards. I have had the most fun in VR, so far, in this game despite it's early stages.Highly recommended. If you'd rather wait for polish, then keep your eye on this one."
,Not Recommended,484870,34693016,Posted: 2 September,all,byteframe,"This will be the hardest review I ever write! A tear-jerker is forthcoming!I paid for this game at 15$ when I got my Vive last year. This was the first MP shooter many of us played, and we were awestruck the first time we played it VR. I joined the Battle Dome chorizzo party when you could still team kill, and those were the good ol days of this game. My vive still had that plastic smell, and I was freaking out from joy 3 minutes into my first play. It went downhill from there from random updates and features, and a continued lack of polish to the aesthetic finally did get to be too much. The developer needed help, and probably could have found some.Everything seemed great! The graphics were garbage, but nobody cared, because but the gameplay was fun! I remember playing this game at my old apartment and ducking behind the walls, and shooting the other people, and it was a great multiplayer team battle, even though we were all just blue and red blobs!I loved the teleportation idea it employed at the beginning). You had to shoot goo from these guns to make areas where your team could teleport too and advance along the battlefield, and it added a nice teamplay dynamic. That WAS an excellent idea before it was removed/relegated.This idea needs to be refactored into a fps/rts team deathmatch hybrid game. Someone please copy the original Battle Dome essence and actually make this game correctly!Before long, the earnest, lone developer keep adding random features, modes and spread everything out over multiple levels, and had no real direction or vision, and it became a ghost town with nobody playing and a soup of different lobbies. You now locomote in different ways.At one point, non-vr support was going to be added. What?You wouldn't believe how many different gun models there are. It certainly makes hanging out in the lobby a bit more interesting. It's actually quite impressive and seems to hint that maybe Mr. Gooseman is just filling up the project with content before some focused Deus Ex Machina of a consolidation that makes it so there will be people playing, but it's out of early access, so I guess not.I got my $14.99 worth I think. I played it early enough to be fond of it and have some good memories. It's a labor of love, clearly, and the developer is learning alot and getting good at game development, but maybe not game design. Battle Dome's scope became so large that it is some kind of test bed for the developer to make about a half dozen shooter experiences. The zeitgeist is now Pavlov VR, which has players and is five dollars cheaper.Seriously, somebody needs to make a huge, gorgeous map, with support for lots of players, and we shoot teleportation goo, and build structures and shoot guns at each other. That server would always be up.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=892732128"

Drop what you are doing, buy, download, and play this game right now.So I just finished playing this game for about an hour.  The only reason why I had to stop was because I ran into my wall trying to get away from another player.  I have been playing the Vive since mid-April.  I have played over 30 VR games.  NEVER have I felt so much immersion that I completely forgot my surrondings to that degree.On that note, make sure to not have your chaperone set to ""developer.""The teleportation in this game is timed so that you cannot simply spam it around the courses.  In fact, when and where to teleport is part of the strategy.  The brilliant part of this game is that every time you teleport you make a ""pew"" sound.  This is like the foot falls of COD or Overwatch.The shooting mechanics are superb and well-balanced.  The sniper rifle is challenging but it works well if you have a steady hand (which I don't and you can't just push the shift key).The voice chat is well done.  The environments are amazing in terms of transporting you to another reality.This is one of the best VR games out there.  In my opinion, it is better than Hover Junkers...and that is saying a lot."

Weapons could have more fire power and could use some haptic feedback. The avatars are weak and need work and the 2 destroy the core maps could have some more visual detail.Overall if it gets enough players for MP then it could be a really good game. The paint the floor movement would lead to teams having to use strategy to defeat the other team. No problem with seeing enemys in the distance and game was clear in that respect.Hoping game keeps improving and more get into it. MP VR is so much fun."

It's Laser Tag on steroids!!My adrenaline level was through the roof, to the point where it was genuinely hard to teleport around, due to my hands shaking so much.If I had one request from the developer, it would be for some kind of ""stick"" to the tiles for the teleport aiming.  It would be easier to move around that way.The shooting feels fantastic (love that handgun.  Seriously... it's a thing of beauty!) and the paint mechanic is a fantastic solution to the teleportation relevance and immersion.  It adds a solid tactical aspect to the game, in that you have to work towards the areas you want, while protecting yourself from your enemy's paint.  The shield, something you can have in lieu of the paint gun, is also a great addition, although I do believe my gun being shot leads to me being hit, which both sucks to find out the hard way, but also makes sense from a ""don't just crouch behind the shield"" balancing perspective.Sadly, for me, I was adjusting my stance when I kicked a wire and shut down my PC (stupid floppy wall sockets... a trip to Home Depot will solve you!).  I've also reached my time limit without sharing, so I'm writing this while watching the wholesale slaughter of a hundred sturdy black stickmen in The Lab.AAA+++ for the game.  I honestly can't recommend it enough.  The graphics certainly seem to be a WIP, although the guns are cool and distinctive as-is.  The graphics honestly don't matter at all compared to the gameplay though!Battle Dome is without a doubt the best example of immersive gameplay I've seen to date for the Vive.  The ability to pop right up behind an enemy and execute him Boondock Saints style is indescribable!!I will absolutely be back to play more!"

I paid the full 14.99 for this game and I feel it was worth the gamble because I see the promising furutre that this game has. 2 really good reasons why. 1, this game is awesome. 2, when you buy these games you are financing the development of the game. People that are complaining about 15 bucks aren't taking into consideration how much work goes into a game like this. Not to mention I have only had this game for a week and they have already pushed out a bunch of updates. That means if you invest in them, they will invest in the game to make it better. That's the takeaway you other gamers should take from this, buying early access games is basically like supporting a new product on kickstarter and we need as many games as we can get for VR.This game is extremely fun and easily one of the most satisfying VR experiences out right now but there are no players. Every once in a while I luck out and find a game but right now the only thing I dont like about this game is that it is empty. Developers! get on social media and spread the good word about your games! I wont complain about the few other gripes I have because the game is brand new and early access so I expected there to be a few little issues.

Movement system is great. Shooting feels classic and responsive. Feels like I've been teleported inside of a late 90s/early 2000s UT or Quake. Guns are great - sniper is difficult to use but the scope is awesome! Game runs flawlessly.The only thing I found a bit tricky was arranging myself within my chaperone bounds after teleporting, but certainly nothing gamebreaking - I just have quite limited space, so I always need to position myself with as much room as possible for leaning out of cover. Though if this was changed I'm not sure if the movement system would feel disorientating (i.e teleporting so that you're facing a different way to allow for more room). Ultimately though, fantastic game with great mechanics - could certainly see some form of this game as a popular competitive shooter akin to CS or Quake."

The graphics are pretty rough, but the gameplay is solid.It's a team objective game where you have to destroy the enemy core at the other side of the map. You get there by covering floorspace with your team's color, in order to allow them to teleport to that floorspace (and the enemy team can in turn color over your territory with their colors).What makes it interesting is there's a few ways players can change their loadouts - there's one-handed weapons (pistol, SMG) that you can combine with a weaker one-handed paint gun, or two handed larger weapons (e.g. Rocket Launcher, Assault Rifle), which mean you'll have to rely on other players' paint, and lastly a big two-handed stronger paint gun. This all allows for a bit of coordination with team roles etc. if people communicate.The map I've played on has lots of cover, and there's a very (very) brief cooldown on the teleportation, which leads to movement in this game working quite well.I highly recommend Battle Dome.

You're also never left standing around for long, as respawn is instant.While the weapons are great in their selection, I'd like to see a few more varieties - grenades that either explode and kill or spray paint in every direction (or both), and a nice bow and arrow would really add to the gameplay.This is my new favourite multiplayer game, and I really hope that more people join in and grow the player base."

Its fairly unpolished, but its 80% of the way there if you just want to shoot strangers in VR. Unlike with Hover Junkers, I get no motion sickness and the teleport mechanic is much less awkward than trying to pilot a hovering vehicle. It does make you wish for a bigger room and I imagine players with large play spaces will have an advanatage as they can walk to cover instead of teleporting, which has a cool down and a very loud ""bleep"" noise that lets your opponents know you're nearby.The only big downside right now is that the game desperately needs more players as there's almost no one on at a time.tldr; I think the devs have a wonderful foundation to build on here.

Movement is limited by the paint your team has already laid on the floor, which really helps this game shine as a co-op game.

Early access is often a red flag for many gamers, but I have no doubt this game will quickly become worth much more than it's current price of $15.Pros:+Plain, simple FUN+Movement and scale of the levels is well designed+Great example of cooperative-based gameplay+Lots of variety in guns, maps, and modes+Developer pushing out frequent updatesCons:-When there aren't players online there is nothing to do. Being a VR title this is a huge bottleneck.-Graphics may turn off some people-Network lag makes it very difficult to utilize a duck and cover strategy"
,Recommended,484870,24738018,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,Villain?,"So I just picked up this game and spent my first 100 minutes in it, and I can already say that this is easily one of my absolute favorite VR experiences. The concept is simple enough - you're assigned a team, you choose your weapon, and you try to position yourself and aim well enough to kill your enemy before they can kill you.The weapons are extremely interesting, and there are plenty of options for whichever strategy you wish to pursue. You have choices like a shotgun, SMG, or what appears to be a flame thrower for close quarters engagements. For mid to longer range you have options like a good ole assault rifle or single shot battle rifle. For the longest range you even get the option of a charge up sniper rifle with a realistic working scope - or for even more fun, a freaking rocket launcher. Picking the right weapon that provides strengths for the tactics you want to employ feels extremely satisfying. Oh, and theres a sword too. Skewering the unsuspecting opponent that just wandered around my corner was always a delight.The movement system works amazingly well. You can - of course - walk around in real space as you would expect. But you also have a teleportation mechanic at your disposal. The catch is that you are only able to teleport once every few seconds, and for a limited range. This makes it so that you can't easily just teleport away to safety when things get rough... No, if you happen to jump into a stupid position, you WILL be punished for it. You can also hear a little noise whenever another player teleports, which more or less allows you to be able to listen for ""footsteps"" of an opponent sneaking around.For this game being in such a supposedly early access state, I'm absolutely in awe of what the developer is already able to present to us. I can guarantee this game is going to be a regularly played one for me. Can't wait to see what further improvements the developer has in store.I completely, and unwaveringly, reccommend this game. Especially if you already love other similar activities like paintball or laser tag."

The gameplay rewards skill without becoming too difficult for new players. It feels like an advanced form of laser tag that requires tactical and team-based gameplay for a decisive victory. The developers have done an excellent job of balancing the gameplay, preventing any one or two weapons from becoming overpowered.I would like to see a few features added in the future, mainly the ability to pick teams and join games in a lobby. The second Destroy the Core map could use a bit more balancing, as it's easy to get into a stalemate, even with carefully planned attacks on enemy positions. The sniper rifle could probably use a slight buff, and the assault rifle could use a bit of an accuracy nerf to promote the use of the laser rifle.Even with all of the nitpicks that I currently have, I thoroughly enjoy this game, and it has been the reason why I put on the Vive the last few days.

,Recommended,484870,23670478,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,Dax,"Don't be put off by it's looks. What lies underneath is a true gem!Battle Dome, like no other Vive game to my knowledge, turns the Vive's largest limitation into its own advantage in such an ingenious way: Territory Control.Normally, teleportation in a multiplayer FPS game, even for the Vive, would be difficult to swallow. However, Battle Dome uses it to great effect with it's territory control mechanic. Your team can only teleport to locations that have been painted with your team's colour. This slows down the pace of the game in the best possible way. Strategy becomes paramount, and maintaining your control of key points is even more important than even attacking the enemy's core. You need to visualise the enemy's sight lines, and keep those key areas out of enemy hands lest they flank your position. You also need to maintain control of areas within your team's sight lines, to rapidly cover ground after respawning and get back into an advantageous position.The balance of offensive power and area control is well thought out - to use the strongest weapons you must forego a paintgun, and must rely on your teammates to pave a path for you. Your job would be to ensure their safety with extreme prejudice! Your painters are the only way you can move forward and maintain your offensive. Painters have a couple of options too. They can carry one of the two varieties of one-handed paintguns and carry a handgun or light SMG with it, or can eschew a weapon entirely for a two-handed paintgun that has improved range and fire-rate.The trade-off between attack and control allows you to adapt to any situation. If the enemy has doubled down on the offensive, you could counter this by having more painters and redecorating the map in a more pleasant colour, cutting the enemy off from reinforcements, and regaining control of key choke points. You could then ramp up your offensive capabilities once more to clean out the remaining enemies and establish a foothold deeper into their territory. Team-wide neglect of either role can quickly spell disaster against an enemy that has even basic situational awareness.Like most active VR games, you best warm up and stretch out your legs a bit before playing, or you will suffer the following day!PROs:- Ingenious game mechanics that use hardware limitations to it's advantage.- Impressive moment-to-moment gameplay.- Large focus on situational awareness and strategy over mindless shooting.CONs:- Aesthetics are very poor right now, but can only improve.VERDICT:An amazing experience that is definitely worth your money and your time!"

As every other review says:  the gameplay is fanatstic, so don't be at all put off by the Early Access graphics.  My first game session breezed by but turned out to be a respectable 70 mins constant play.  Constant crouching behind boxes and peering round corners, constant painting paths, and constant fragging the enemy.  Game mechanics are simple to learn and yet team tactics and individual skills can be improved over time.  This is not a ""play for 5 minutes and then never again"" demo.  Don't delay!  Buy it!"

TFC/CS comes to early VR.After seeing so many good reviews I cracked and purchased Battle Dome, I regret nothing!This is officially the first true VR multiplayer first person shooter a VR-Quake/TFC/CS of sorts. Once you get the hang of it, it plays very naturally.The graphics are not amazing but it  doesn't distract from the gameplay and almost makes it feel stylized.Mechanics wise, the wall detection needs work and the shooting is a little loose but again it didn't interfere with my enjoyment.Thoughts for potential players:- Selecting the left hand gun is done with the right controller (everything is selected with the right controller)- one handed weapons allow you to carry a paint-gun, two handed weapons do not and your left hand is only good for teleportingTwo things that got me for a few minutes.Thoughts for the devs (whom I thank profoundly):- integrated chat is amazing, give a way to squelch players- Default settings or saving settings from the previous play would be great (like turning the music off etc..)- A Tutorial of some form would not go amiss- keep going this is a great VR game (I know it represents larger potential buyers but the non-VR player plan seems dangerously unbalanced)if you have a vive you owe it to yourself to buy this game, it is now number 1 in our household."

This is THE multiplayer shooter for VR right now. It obviously needs some work. The graphics are for the most part placeholder things but this is a one-man operation. You quickly forget the poor graphics because the gameplay is so much fun.The way locomotion is handled is quite clever. You can move about your room space and teleport as well. In all the game modes besides team deathmatch, you can teleport only onto tiles that have your team's color on them. The way to do that is to grab the paint gun and go painting your way across the map, while at the same time denying the enemy their paint. This means you need to take care where you are teleporting and it adds strategic depth due to the ability to deny the enemy team access to areas of the map.The gunplay is satisfying. You can aim a gun much like you would in real life, using the sights and closing one of your eyes. The ""two-handed"" weapons really are only held in one hand while the other acts as a teleporting device. You can of course try to brace the weapon controller with the off-hand to imitate two-handed-ness yourself and it does help. Hopefully sooner or alter someone will create a rifle-like attachment for the Vive's controllers. Or I'll 3D print one myself...This is still in very early stages and the graphics, weapon, and map varieties are very limited but I look forward to seeing the evolution of this project."

The game pits two teams of 4 against one another. Together, with you and your team, you paint the floor tiles to advance to more tactical cover and positions to destroy the enemy's core. The result is a fun, fast paced shooter that will remind you how much fun you had at laser tag as a kid.Even as an early access game this is simply the best you can get for the VIVE at the moment.

,Recommended,484870,23652602,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,Eavy,"Oh boy, what a great VR game! Don't let the looks of screenshots, videos or the game itself fool you - the presentation may be lacking a lot right now (this is early access after all), but the core gameplay is pretty much perfect (if you like tactical shooters or paintball/lasertag)!Battle Dome is a rather slow-paced (mainly team-based, depending on game mode) tactical shooter with the brilliant mechanic of painting the floor to restrict teleportation. It actually reminds me of Rainbow Six: Siege, which is my favorite game and the only non-VR game I still play since I got my Vive, because teamplay, communications and positioning are paramount.There are even different roles you can pick by choosing your loadout: If you pick the large paintgun, you can't shoot the enemy but paint ground faster to give your team more movement options. If you pick a large gun, you can't paint anymore and have to rely on your mates to paint the ground so you can move better. Or you can paint and shoot at the same time, but both are less effective. Makes working together all the more important.Now 15 € may be a little high for a game in such early stages, I'd rather see a lower intro price to grow the playerbase quickly, but the game itself certainly is worth much more. This isn't a simple tech demo like many other VR experiences right now, this is a game that you can come back to and play again and again. The replayability is already great but will get even better with more players, more modes and much needed refinement which is happening all the time.So I see this purchase as both aquisition of an excellent game with so much potential as well as support for a very creative and responsive dev. I hope he quickly makes enough money to hire more people to work on the game (especially graphics, sound and UI) and then he could easily rise the price to twice or thrice the current amount.Oh, and I hope there will be more realistic weapon handling, too. Especially reloading could be imroved a lot by making it more physical instead of pushbutton, take a look at H3VR, that's the benchmark for how gunplay should be done in VR. :)"

In the main game modes you have to conquer terrain from the enemy by painting the ground in your colour. Thisll lead to fierce battles for chokepoints like stairs. It feels so awesome to succesfully conquer some stairs as a painter/handgunner whilst protected by a teammate with a shield, to subsequently conquer an upper floor and bombard the enemy core (the objective to destroy) with a bazooka.

,Recommended,484870,23663867,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,EternalGamer,"First, I'll get an obvious point out of the way.  I know you are thinking.  This game looks terrible and not terribly interesting. Why would I pay $15 for this?  I thought the same thing.  In fact, I put off buying it at least five or six times, sometimes adding it to my cart and leaving it, but never going through the transaction.  Buying this game is a lot like taking bad tasting medicine.  It's not an enjoyable purchase, but afterwards the game's effect on you will kick in and you'll be feeling pretty alright about it.What you can't really gather from looking at screens or even the videos is that the gameplay, as others have reported here, is really damn good.I admit I'm a tough sell on multiplayer shooters. It's not a genre I even bother with in recent years. Part of the reason is that it's just not fun to get stomped over and over again by people who are already far better at them. Part is just the game play loop of them is a bit stale to me and too twitch laden. But this isn't your standard FPS game.  Far from it.  There is a lot of thought going on here.  Thought about which load out to use at different points in the map based upon what your team mates are using. Thoughts about positioning. Because people can't just run freely in this game like in most FPS games, taking up good positions and holding good positions matters a lot more. And because it uses room scale, you'll catch yourself doing cool stuff like desparately shooting a teleport on way while crawling back towards cover, while looking the other way while shooting cover fire. Or standing tip toe to see over a box, or blind fire overing it while you paint and area in front of you. This isn't just a typical twitch based shooter. Or even a stop and pop cover shooter. It is something different. Something that rewards thinking about spacial awareness in a more fundemental way.A lot of VR experiences are about visually placing you in a space.  But this game is about the mechanics of placing you in a 3D space.  Give it $15 and 20 minutes.  There's more game here than most VR offerings combined.PROS:-Active multiplayer scene - plenty of people playing, at least this weekend.-A more thoughtful shooter. The Two handed vs. One handed Paint and Shoot dynamic is very clever.-Visible projectile (a la Doom) - this is a huge plus in my book. You can actively dodge shots.-Not nearly as ""twitch"" as most shooters due to limited mobility. Nice pacing.-online play seems very stable and solid, especially for an early access game this early in development.  No port forwarding nonsense or other issues.  Jump in and play.CONS-When a team gets an advantage it is literally an uphill battle and really tough to turn the tide.-Players who don't work together lose. You have to be comfortable talking or have a buddy play with you if you want to get the most out of this game, I think. At the very least, you have to pay attention to what your squad is doing and try to compliment each other/back each other up.-People who are above you and in cover have too much advantage.

This game is everything I want from a vr pvp shooter. I cannot wait to see how this game develops and what other developers will create based off this game. To the person who fathered this -- congratulations -- you created something that, in my opinion, holds a torch to the great titles at the beginning of an era.When I loaded up my first game my initial thought was what a waste of 14 bucks. The graphics were sub-par, the level design bland, and the weapon system scarce... and I then I started to play.I currently have a play area of about 12x9 -- so large enough to be able to walk around. As soon as I stepped around the first corner and was blasted on by a guy laying prone on the ground I dived back around the corner I came from and realized my brains legitimate response to it-- instantly hooked. Fighting AI is one thing -- fighting other people changes everything.I only have about 2.5 hours in -- life is getting in the way of play time. But -- in that two and a half hours I have had the most exciting pvp experience of my life. If you are a decent shot in real life and have gone through some basic room clearing strategies this game is not only tactical but... it will improve your skills to react against some one who is shooting at you. The firefights feel authentic, you feel the pressure of the enemy closing in on you, you can be tricky and sneaky -- and there is nothing like knowing you got the better of another real person.The only other game comparable to this out of the 20 or so titles I have played is hover junkers -- but in my opinion -- this game-play is far superior.Anyone who is hesitating to try this. If call of duty got you going this might just eliminate your desire to ever play another pvp fps on a flat screen. Yes, the graphics are meh-- but once you dive into a session and get the hang of the mechanics graphics become a moot point. This is all about game play. And game-play it has in spades.To the developer. Thank you. You just pushed a giant ball downhill."

It suffers from the trappings of any other multiplayer game: if your team sucks, or you suck, and the other team doesn't, it's a little oppressive.  However, the game is quick enough to learn that this isn't a problem, and with good tactics and strategy you can even win without being the best shot, which is rather unique.Since the game operates on teleporting you are clearly at an advantage with a very large play space, as you can put yourself to a corner and then run around it, but as long as you have something you can comfortably go from prone to standing in, quickly without hazard, you should be good. I'd say 2mx2m is the smallest you should have.The weapons save for the sniper are fun and have their uses.  I've engaged and defeated 3 enemies with a sword and shield (and timing) and come out ahead, and cleared a 4 man squad on one clip of the assault rifle.  I've squatted a ramp with a shield and smg and headshot riflemen with the pistol while painting a path to the other side.  This game is a blast, give it a shot.It's also a great work out if you're willing to squat down or dive around to avoid getting shot.

While not very graphically intensive (which is good for anyone suffering from low frame rates), it has unique and ultra fun game dynamics, such as zero-G jetpack mode. There are tons of maps and game modes to play around with, including a few wave-based single player modes and bot matches.BUT... The sad truth is that it is a rare occasion when you will find other players to play a match with because most VR gamers are playing newer shooters like Pavlov. I like Pavlov, but this game beats it out in playability, which is why I'm baffled as to why so few play it.BUT don't let that discourage you from this game! If the player-base picks up (from people like you giving it a chance) then this game has a second chance at life. I often check to see if other people are playing and will gladly jump into a match if I see an open lobby. I will also randomly play a few bot matches to see if any players will jump in, which does happen on occasion.I recommend downloading it, especially if you see it on sale!

The developer did not invent anything new, like any other VR developer. They just brought some really good mechanics together in VR format.You paint to teleport across the map which is a strategy in it self. Do you focus on painting or shooting? Do you deny the other team their paint? It is a blast when you and friends are coordinating. There are many guns and a few melee weapons. A couple different modes, but they only server to separate the low population further.Overall, the game is a blast when you can get a full lobby.

Main gameplay mechanic is teleporting behind people and firing them with almost one-shot weapons. Map design takes no cues from classic arena shooters or even from real life laser tag courts, leaving them barren and overly massive. Weapons are hard to aim, as the sights are really bland and inaccurate. Some weapons don't even fire where you aim, but rather way below the aim point.Sometimes less would be more. One gun with 1-2 settings with a more balanced locomotion would be superior to this, and would provoke real life experiences akin to laser tag. This, how it is at the moment, is just too much 'Rule of Cool' in one entirely shoddy game.As replacements I would recommend Hover Junkers. That title, at 30€ or so, is also more expensive than it really needs to be, but at least it delivers an enjoyable multiplayer experience, that feels balanced and skill-based.Do not buy Battle Dome as it is now, or will be in around year in my opinion.

Half way into my first match when someone on the other team teleported right next to me and started shooting, I turned and ran smack into my apartment wall. Had to stop playing I was laughing so hard. I've never had a problem with staying inside chaperone before. This is going to be lots of fun :)"

Overall though its one of the funnest multiplayer experiences on the Vive. It really reminds me of old school Half life or counter strike. Its very basic but it feels great."

It needs a lot more polish, but the core game mechanics are there and it is a lot of fun. Top of my wishlist is a better reloading mechanic. The countdown timer isn't great. Something like the game ""Out of Ammo"" would be a huge improvement. That said, I wouldn't hesitate to recomend this to any multiplayer VR enthusiest."

Really, I love it, one of my top 5 VR games and I have now 67. :-)I was only able to play 30 minutes because I´m sick and I was sweeting so much. I will make a rest and then go back to the battlefield. :-D Don´t know if it was luck but there was more than enough players online and I was in a fight within seconds. In some reviews was written that there are not enough players, seems to be solved now because everyone loves the game, 98% positive reviews can´t lie. ;-)Why is this game great for me?Very hard to describe, it´s one of these games that you would probably never play in 2D, but with VR and room scale it blows your mind. It´s a ton of fun to duck/kneel behind the walls and boxes, shooting around the corner and so on. Here are some more ""tangible"" things-It´s a nice competitive game with huge team factor when you play with others in a team. You can and have to cover each other and play together for success.-The weapons are very cool and there should be for everyone a fitting weapon. The shield seems on the first look a little bit op but maybe this was only a wrong first impression. I think you have to take a bigger weapon in that case I could imagine.-Level was designed very well with the right amount of objects at the right places.-Voice chatFortunately I feel fit enough now to start one more round. :-) Have fun, it´s worth every cent and I think it will get one of my most played games very soon and long. To be honest, I think that this will change in the future when there is a very realistic and good game like Battlefield or something like that on the market. I like more the realistic style but until this time Battle Dome will be one of my favorites. Thanks a lot to the dev for this nice game, really good work. Your plans for the future of the game are great and in a very good order."

The bleak graphics put me off at first, but as I should have learned by now, graphics don't matter when you're in VR. Easy to get into, allows some tactic (paintgun only, weapon only, melee, shield), some teamplay required to advance. There are two BGM tracks availabe, I found track two super awesome to play to. The gane definitely requires some work on its presentation, menus, interface and such, and one time I could accidentally teleport into an obstacle, unable to get out, I had to shoot myself to respawn. Buy it."
,Recommended,484870,23821725,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Lucid Trips,Wow this game has a lot potential!Just a few things that could be differnet from my opinon:- Teleportation: Is boring as always & kind of kills the flow - why don't use a teleport gun with some ammo. (similar to the paint gun)- Teleportation:  needs a soundfeed back when it is reloaded.- It also would be nice to have some kind of teleportation highways that shortens the travel time- Gun shots color: would be nice when teams had differnet colors to better see who is shooting- Add granatesDear dev please keep on developing this game I think it can be the CounterStrike of VR!
