Whether this is alternate name of the dev here I'm not sure, but I figure one needs to be aware of that. The dev has taken out the of the H-scenes, added censor bars over the character when undressed and changed the text slightly (No noticble improvements to spelling and grammar I notice). As to whether or not the DLC content for this was made later on or is also a part of Lascivious Devil Maze I don't know, I only played about an hour or so of LDM before writing this.The dev has also given out free keys for the game in the past only to later revoke them, as well as fabricating positive reviews to push the user review rating up.Shady developer, behaviour that likely goes against Steam's ToS and the product itself may *possibly* be stolen content.Do not buy."

The text is frustratingly incomprehensible in English, with broken characters between every word in place of spaces, and some words that cut off before the next. Has just about the most sluggish controls I've ever tried to deal with, except for the menu screen, which works pretty smoothly and quickly, funnily enough. Made it much easier to scroll over to the quit button."

This is actually an inferior version of another ""game"" by this dev made with RPG Maker, with even less features. The dev himself stated that he finds it""so hard to code""!!!

,Not Recommended,484950,33053335,Posted: 30 June,all,boyflea,"Steam Summer sale: I am a sucker for RPGMaker games, and this one has its charms.Basically, would you like to control an entrapped woman called Alma, whom you can undress and force to fight monsters?So the concept stinks (go here if you wand a Bawlderised version:https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/850467744900484224/352D68F506EA951A7C06663EAF4456DA8D1E6540/https://www.dropbox.com/s/7lgll7xmqsakhik/bewbderized.zip?dl=0But is the game any good?Well, imagine someone had prematurely spent all their art-budget on the pretty girl overlays and then jsut used ALL the default RPGMaker graphics and music.But someone making this put a lot of care into the achievements and secrets: there is a game worth grinding for in here... deep in it's heaving bosom there beats a heart. But alos a lot of shoddy nonsense too, sadly. The frills are nice, the core a mess.It uses Falcao Pearl's excellent map-based real-time fighting engine on top of VX Ace's core engine.So you wanter aroudn a top-dwon map, and fight monsters by pressing an array of keys hot-wired to certain actions (that you can customise)Now, having spent six months making something similar:-lhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=946491763I despair at this game in places: its a bit ropey and has bugs, but hey, look at Alma's bewbs!  ...So yes bugs:PROS:- the enemies are mainly static to add a good layer of strategy- there is no plot, but in a way, this is a good thing: you do focus on the grind- Alma is an attractive main character, but her body is the only really memorable thing- all of Alma's colthing is mapped to her in-map avatar, which is cool (even if her jiggling is a bit odd)CONS:-some have ranged attacks, but these are invisible! eg: stand two squares away, ouch, still take damage!-all attacks against Alma do no obvious damage (no anims or even a red flash!) so it is easy to suddenly die and go 'eh?'- level maps are abysmal! it would be far better to use a 'world-tile' map than what is here: small conpact maps with deliberately mixed-up tilesets that just clash and look ugly- framerate is always an issue in VX Ace, and it can slow-down a lot, so Alma feels sluggish most of the time- has 30 game slots, but has trouble navigating past the first 16 slotsCONTENT:- Alma's boobies literally go 'boing' whenever her ample frame leans across the screen, and she seems to be made of jelly. bit creepy. for me, was distracting, so replaced them to focus on the game. I like boobs, but makes playing this game on the train embarassing, :).- Plot is not there, and the dialogue is drivel.- Alma is a sex-toy, so I guess a prisoner she'll remain. :(CONCLUSION:Surprisingly, it's not as bad as you think: at some point, someone put together a nice idea, then got convinced to go commercial, add in boobs, focus on promoting nudity and stop addressing the gameplay balance, bugs and playability.I am angry as hell! I could have made a better game (I did!) but... but... dammit.SCORE:I bought this at 50% off... realy, like Alma, wait until there is at least 80% off before you buy it.Ok, sour grape aside, I will say i do NOT recommend this game, but only just.Fix the bugs, make the dungeon look nice and clear, replace the stock artwork and music, pour love into the game, not lust, and for heavan's sake, buy Alma a decent sports-bra, then the game would be a respectable 7/10 - but as it stands, it is a cheap thrill that ends up a mess in the player's hands: 5/10"

76561198010134705,Not Recommended,484950,24268418,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Selva,"It is traditional here to say ""I really wanted to like this game.""  But, I paid money for this.  I do not, in general, purchase things expecting to not like them.  It has become standard here to say ""Steam / Valve needs to have a better rating system.  Or at least a neutral rating.""  It bears repeating only because Valve still doesn't.  I would rather give this a neutal rating than a negative one.  But, I can't.  In the end, the question below is ""Do you recomend this game.""  Short answer: No.  Truth be told I paid almost half a dollar for this (on sale) and I feel I... almost, got a reasonable deal.Evil Maze is not bad, but it has a lot of basic problems.  It acts like an action game but is set up to be a turn based RPG.  It gives in game information (treasure finds / details and such) on the same layer of text as the stats and icons at the bottom of the screen.  Making the information, at best, very difficult to read.  Status effects are conveyed with small square icons that need their own translation.  (No legend for these has been located by me.)  It turns off any keyboard controls if you have a game pad plugged in.  It tries to teach concepts in a very brief tutorial at the beginning of the game, but the instructions make no sense.  I was told at one point to push the ""E"" button on the XBox game pad.  (Hint.  No such button.)  I'm guessing things might work better in the games native language (I assume Chinese), or if a better translation and localisation had been used.  (I can not for the life of me figure out why the cure for blindness potion is called ""Woke up with this medicine."")  But you can not review a game on what it might have been.  The game is plagued with design decisions that range from being just bad to ones that make no sense.Don't get me wrong.  The game DOES work.  These are not glitches.  If there are any actual bugs in the game, I have not noticed them.  My objections concern what are simply poor design choices.  (But there are a lot of them.)  For a game that consists of moving around in a series of small areas, fighting monsters that will either be relatively easily beaten, or very nearly instantly kill you (with no real warning as to which might be which until you memorise which monsters are insta-gibbers) it does work.  Admittedly, I have not completed the game yet.  But on level 4 (Of supposedly 10) the pattern remains unbroken.  So...If you get can this on sale, you probably won't be too dissapointed.  I have had some fun with it.  And the price is not completely unreasonable.  But...  Honestly, it feels like something put together with Construct2.  (I'm betting I'm misspelling that name.)  It feels like something that would be getting an average of 2 stars on Kongregate.  So.  No.  I do not recommend this game.  I wish I could.  When done well, I generally like games like this.-------Note to the developer.  If anyone aproaches you asking for money to change this review, do not give it to them.  This is a non profit review.  Anyone who says otherwise is conning you.  I wish you luck with your next venture."

,Not Recommended,484950,30826076,Posted: 29 March,all,BippoErnesti,"While Evil Maze isn't really a bad game, it isn't that great either. It's a generic grid-based action RPG with a sketchy English translation.The gameplay is basic RPGMaker action RPG, with pretty weak feedback in terms of receiving damage from enemies, making it seem like just their bad mojo is enough to make you hurt. At the start you are very liable to die, but this quickly reverses once you start finding equipment, at which point there's rarely a threat big enough to make you care. Just make sure you don't softlock yourself in the second level by unlocking the wrong doors.As far as the graphics, sound and music are concerned, I'm pretty sure everything in the game uses stock RPGMaker assets, excluding probably the main character (and the ""CGs""), but I wouldn't know. Oh, and the ""lewd factor"" of the game is absolutely not worth the money, if that's what you're looking for. You could literally just download the official patches to get the images without bothering to play.The game is very RNG-heavy, including things like damage dealt/received and spells learned from scrolls, et cetera, which might make some people want to savescum (especially learning spells, as useless as they are).The DLC is worth even less than the base game, yet paired together they cost triple the base cost of the game.Unless you're a crazy game collector, there's no reason to get this game, even as a joke of some kind."

And I did try it out and got further. Its as repetitive as it was before and as boring as it was before. Update End.""Real-time Action + RPG+ MAGIC Tower Strategy = PUZZLE ARPG!""That is what this game promises.Now to the points as to why this is far from being what it promises.1. Real-time ActionThe only thing that comes even close to that is you moving around. As most of the enemies are not moving around.2. RPGI have only reached floor two as the game is quite hard in terms of ""You shouldnt kill this one on floor two as he instantly murders you."" So far there are no RPG elements apart from the fact that this was made in RPG Maker. Thats it.3. MAGIC Tower StrategyApart from the fact that I dont understand that the first word is in capital letters the rest of it only seems fitting to the half of it. It is supposed to be a tower you are in. That much is fine. However the only thing based on Strategy is who you kill first and not how you move according to the enemies movement. That is a crucial part of strategy which is not in the game.4. Puzzle ARPGPuzzle... Where is the puzzle? Which door your open first with the limited amount of keys? Or how you move through the area so you wont die too fast? ARPG? What? This is far from a Adventure or Action type of RPG.This game could not be worse.It does look very promising from what you can see. And for the price itself, sure it might be worth a buy. But thats only in your head. Do not buy this. Or buy it on a sale. Its not worth the money. Or at the very least not the 2 euro part of the 2.99.Lets put it this way: Quality over Quantity. There is so much in this game that the Quality drops below 20%."

I played this game, not sure what to expect, especially since this is an RPG Maker game. But, so far... As of the writing of this review, it's not too bad. Certainly a far cry from a Game of the Year winner, but... It's pretty good for a dirt cheap game.Gameplay is quite simple. Get your character within range to attack and hit the attack button until you need a healing item or your enemy is dead. The game's tutorial is fairly easy to grasp as well, since Alma seems to explain herself the game's mechanics.Story is quite simple from what I've seen. You play as Alma, a female... Soldier I want to say...? Whom has been trapped at the bottom of a dark dungeon and has no memory of how she got there and it's up to you to help her get out of the dungeon.My favorite thing above all is the character customization. Most of the gear you equip to your character not only shows up on her full-body portrait, but it also shows up on her sprite. It is a little funny to see her breasts bouncing while she's wearing metal armor, but... just a funny thing, and not bad to me.Plus... Bonus points for the game having a sexy protagonist. :3"

There's magic elements but was frustrated long before I got to more than a cure spell.On one hand it has one good things going for it:- You get a monster book early on that you can check your enemy's stats against your own before battling it.Simple but it's the only way you can get through this.The layout of each ""level"" is dense.  Monsters everywhere, doors and keys galore, what I can only assume are puddles of poison that hurt when I step on them, spike traps, and I only saw 3 levels.But this gives way to my biggest problem with it.  The layout is very poorly designed after the first level.An example would be in ""level 8"" (you start from 10 and work backwards).  You have 4 teleporters around you once you get there.  However when you go through a teleporter and come back, you have to go down a floor and come back up to be able to go through a different teleporter.Another gripe is the way to recover.  Due to the short nature of the game and density of level, there are multiple times where you can recover health, once.  There are 2 points I found that recover health multiple times, a bed next to you when you start, and a river you find on the next level.  However each one has limited uses, although the bed's seems to reset once you clear a level.Also since the bed is at the very beginning.  If I want to make use of it, I have to backtrack all the way to it, and all the way back up.  Especially since level 8 seems to have a pretty large difficulty spike.Another nitpick is the keys and doors I mentioned earlier.  There are doors that are useless in the game and if you accidentally use a key on one of them, good luck buddy.Ultimately a pretty poorly designed game.  Please use your money on a different RPGmaker game."

The game barely costs anything so I just bought it and played it for a couple of levels, and here's my explanation on what this actually is.Basically this is a combination of a puzzle/adventure game and and RPG, made in RPG Maker. You can only move one square at a time like in all RPG Maker games, but the game isn't turn-based. That probably led the earlier review to call the controls sluggish. The game is designed to work with movement like this, though, so I didn't find it to be a problem.A more serious problem is that the controller settings are extremely bizarre, at least if you're using an XBOX One controller. I don't think they are rebindable either. Your attack button is the right trigger, for example. I did manage to play the game despite this, but the buttons really should be rebindable. Then again I might just not have noticed the option...The translation isn't very good either, as the other reviewer mentioned, but this isn't really a story-based game so it didn't bother me. It might become a problem at some point, if you can't understand what you should be doing, but I didn't run into problems like that during the couple of levels I played.How the game works is that you are a girl who has been locked in a dungeon. Monsters either stand still or move very slowly, but if you stand next to them they will damage you. If you kill them you get EXP, and many of them are blocking your access to items or the stairway to the next level, so you have to fight them even if they don't really threaten you. You have to find keys to open doors, but you have to decide which doors you want to open and in which order. You can also cause various things to happen by checking out interesting looking things in the levels, like in an adventure game.So it's sort of a puzzle where you have to figure out which order you should fight the various monsters and open the doors, but the RPG elements give you some leeway. I though that was very interesting. You don't have to do everything perfectly like in a normal puzzle game, since you have equipment and you can learn spells.I think this game seems to be pretty good, actually, but it isn't a normal RPG, and the complaints mentioned in the other review are valid. The game is really cheap, though, so you won't lose much even if you don't like it."

If you kill them you get EXP, and many of them are blocking your access to items or the stairway to the next level, so you have to fight them even if they don't really threaten you. You have to find keys to open doors, but you have to decide which doors you want to open and in which order. You can also cause various things to happen by checking out interesting looking things in the levels, like in an adventure game.So it's sort of a puzzle where you have to figure out which order you should fight the various monsters and open the doors, but the RPG elements give you some leeway. I though that was very interesting. You don't have to do everything perfectly like in a normal puzzle game, since you have equipment and you can learn spells.I think this game seems to be pretty good, actually, but it isn't a normal RPG, and the complaints mentioned in the other review are valid. The game is really cheap, though, so you won't lose much even if you don't like it."

No explanations are given. you can put a flame in your pocket but it doesnt do anything. you start off with a potion to cure blindness. when i played against a bat it said i went blind but im not sure how that affects the game and then i thought maybe it would stop my attacks so i was going to drink the medicine but i (guess i) stood still for too long and the bat killed me. Also, during one play through i was able to open the second set of doors, but in the next play through i couldnt find the keys for those doors."

First of all - i'm not a fan of RPGmaker made games, because 99% of them(i'm sorry, but it's true) are made with slightly interesting, or not interesting at all, or unbearably dull and booring stories. This one tho... it has no story. I mean the one where you'll have to read a ton of text. You'll be playing a simple rpg with secret areas, hidden treasure, a lot of things to kill and collect. That's it.About the animu content:If you don't like it - why do you bother. Over 9999 other games on steam.About the controls:It's not so complicated to have around 10 keys which are directions, actions and menu to play a game is it? Controller works fine for me. The keyboard is ok. BTW - you can go community hub and see how to edit input!! WOOOOA!About the game:A good game."

,Recommended,484950,23657095,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,Lain,"This Action RPG is rather simple but I found it to be pretty fun nonetheless and given the cheap price it earns my recommendation.You start out in a jail cell on the lowest level of the maze and you got to work your way out, using what you find to help you fight your way up.Speaking of finding, the game has secrets hidden in the levels, from weapons to special vendors to some exp (and speaking exp, you get a bit of exp from searching when you find something, which is nice).You start out with very limited MPs and no special skills or magic spells. As you advance you'll find scrolls (you'll also find some on vendors) to teach you random magic and skills, though you'll have to decide if using those or if to conserve MPs to be able to rest a bit and regain HPs, at least at the beginning.The English in the game is... not too good. It's understandable but it could use work, though since the game is very cheap (1,19€ with the launch discount) and the gameplay/exploration fun, I'm not going to hold it against the game too much.Talking about exploration, exploring the various levels feels a bit like a puzzle, as in deciding which enemy to try and tackle, which to leave to come back to later, when and which magic to use, what equipment to use to reduce damage based on the element the monster's attack uses and which one they are weak against (you'll get a monster's book and an equipment scroll while you explore the maze, which will provide info about the monsters' strength/weakness as well as the element attunement for the equipment you can use).The very generous amount of save slots means being able to try different approaches, which is something I quite like.I'd also like to note that I found a bit of randomness in the loot you can find in treasure chests. I found a pair of copper shoes, died, reloaded and then the chest gave me a piece of copper armor instead the next time, which was better for my needs.While on the subject of equipment, it reflects both on your sprite character as well as your character's artwork, so as you upgrade you'll also see your character change somewhat. You can also remove your equipment completely, but then your character's artwork becomes invisible, which feels a bit cheap as a way to remove some risque parts of the game."

It looks quite simple at first glance, but you actually have to manage your keys carefully, as well as your life, mana and gold, as they are kind of limited. True enough, the English translation sucks, there are quite a few mistakes, but you can understand most of it just fine. Also, there's a big plus (At least I think it is): Many secret stuff on the cenarios. You have to check anything unusual, as there might be some item, gold, XP, or even some secret passage that REALLY help out. Many battles are won by luck, since many enemys have high attack but miss most of them, and many of Alma's attacks will miss too, wich makes me save my game a lot in order to not have to kill the same 10 or 15 monsters again just 'cause I got bad luck (Luck's also an atribute in the game, just so you know). I also like trying most of the equips just to see how they look on Alma, 'cause they will change her image during the dialogs."

As with most RPG's, you must mow down monster after monster in order to escape from the maze.First of all, this game is difficult. At least, I thought so, after continuously getting killed by any enemy I happened to walk by. The battle system is simple: you walk near the enemy, and you get damaged by them continuously until you swing your sword around enough to kill them. The difficult part is deciding which enemies you are able to kill now and which ones to kill once you level up or get more equipment. The controls for the xbox controller are somewhat strange and not rebindable, but this did not take away too much from the gameplay.Overall, I thought this game was pretty good, and its quite cheap, so I would recommend it."
