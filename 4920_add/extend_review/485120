,Not Recommended,485120,29676407,Posted: 3 February,all,Masa,"Frog Climbers is a simple party climbing game that's very light on content.The core gameplay is decent, you use both analog sticks to control your limbs and keep grabbing handholds and pulling yourself towards the top. Unfortunately this is pretty much the whole game. There's no online multiplayer and single player is extremely limited and gets boring really quickly without bots or any real goal apart from timed runs.I wouldn't recommend Frog Climbers unless you already have several gamepads and local friends to play the game with. With some more content this might have been a fun game. As it is, it's more of tech demo than a proper game.I received this game for free from a giveaway but this didn't affect my review.The good:- The climbing itself works reasonably wellThe bad:- Very light on content- No way to configure gamepad controls and no M+KB support- No 16:10 resolution support"

A really cool local multiplayer game.Pros:+ controls are good+ singleplayer+ pick up and play+ a lot of very interesting levels+ a good challenge+ 4 modifiers that change up the gameplay+ daily challenge with leaderboards+ if you fall you dont have to climb the whole thing again, you can start at about the same point+ if a player is not fast enough, he gets a lift up, to still compete against othersCons:- the price is a bit too high for the amount of content- no level editor, which would have been great- the one arm challenge cant be completed on some stages- Im glad singleplayer is included, but its not much fun- no online-multiplayerA great party game to play with friends on the couch. The controls work great and the gameplay can get hectic and chaotic in a fun way. I laughed a lot of times and would recommend getting it in a sale."

So essentially, it's a game of mount your friends in real time, but you are limited to only certain parts of the mountain to grab on to. The only bad things I have about this game is that there's no Keyboard+Mouse support, and that there's no online. But other than that, it's an amazing game.P.S. The developer is a cool guy, he'll probably fix the cons down the road.Edit: If you have an XBox One (or 360 if you have Windows 7) controller, and it's wireless, just by a dongle for it off of Amazon. That's how I play 4 player."

I couldn't describe this game in any other way than being the pure essence of what a party game should be like. Fueled by rivalry in it's purest forms.If you don't hate your friends enough, this is the game for you9.5/10"
,Recommended,485120,30704693,Posted: 24 March,all,Vulture Culture,"Why is this game so good? Frog Climbers is one of the weirdest games I've ever played, yet somehow also one of the most fun! The whole point of the game is, you're a frog, your friends are frogs, you're racing up a mountain, you have to win. It's really that simple, the controls are different, but very easy to get used to, and the best part, you can play with up to four people, so you can embrace the awesome stupidity of this game with your friends!DON'T FORGET THIS GAME REQUIRES, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, REQUIRES A CONTROLLER TO BE PLAYED."

Maybe some more elements (parts of rock) added, some color variations for frogs and wheels, maybe some of them unlockable.Great game, good fun. Get your own!"

,Recommended,485120,26216759,"Posted: 25 October, 2016",all,Challak,"Frog Climbers is an excellent party game, a ton of fun with a group of friends (even those who don't usually play games).Several friends and I recently played using a combo of PS4 and wired XBOX controllers connected to my steam link and everyone had a great time.After ""Mount Your Friends"" was a huge success with my group of friends (especially while drinking) I stumbled upon this game and thought it might result in similar fun. Just over half of our group preferred this game. This is frantic and hilarious action, the random map generation set by difficulty level is very well done and along with the gameplay modifiers makes for excellent replayability."

,Recommended,485120,25967729,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Lord Pigfoot Nosebeggar XVII,"Seeing as the game just came out it has relatively few reviews, but it isoh-so-deserving of more thumbs up.I just started playing this and tried the daily mountain, it was quite easy to learn but so hard to master.You can easily play alone and randomly generate mountains to climb, all very unique and fun.You can apply modifiers like moon-gravity, burning hands and such.But the real fun of this game surely comes from local coop though, which I did not get the chance to try yet.Upon seeing the game today I immediatly bought it because of it's potential. Endless amounts of generated maps that all feel unique and friends to be aspiteful douchefrogto? YES PLEASE!I played 14 Minutes so far and i'm already convinced that this game is going to gain traction within the community. I hope my friends like it as much as I do, because if they do this will surely become our new go-to-couch-game next to speedrunners."

,Recommended,485120,30481707,Posted: 12 March,all,larkedd,"Fun little game.  You'll have plenty of laughs and countless rematches before you call it quits.Don't expect a lot of content or much of anything in the way of customizations.  This is just simple fun.  Also, I wouldn't recommend getting this game if you're planning on playing it alone.My main problem with this game is the controls.  I don't know if it's just my friends and I, but my hands kind of hurt after playing.  I've tried both an Xbox 360 style control (Logitech F710) and the Stream controller.  That said, the Steam controller is very difficult to use in the first place.  I wouldn't really want to deduct points for this because the controls really couldn't be improved no matter what.  For this same reason, I wouldn't deduct points for not being able to use the keyboard and mouse.Overall, I recommend the game.  You'll get a couple hours of fun out of it."
