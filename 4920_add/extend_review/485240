,Recommended,485240,26205621,"Posted: 24 October, 2016",all,Rafport,"Edit: I'll add some more info after the first update. Onward locomotion is here, it's quite identical, setting the speed at 3/5 (the game has a setting for walk speed, this is the mid) almost same walk, almost same run when you double tap the corner. The wobble during stairs is solved. Two great improvement than make the game more playable and more comfortable. It's the best thumbpad implementation I saw after Onward, because it's basically identical.Some work on vehicles too, it's better than before but still not perfect (it very depends on the vehicle, some are still sicknening). I count in next patches to be able to run some floating stuff without camera oscillations. Vehicles on this game are very cool and nicely rendered, it's a shame not be able to use it.Maybe for the new SteamVR beta feature for asyncronous frames, maybe for optimizations, but the game looks very smooth just now and with the maximum AA even extremely sharp in distant objects, one of less aliased game for Vive I've ever tried.Still needed more contents, but with the Onward control it's way more polished and playable tha before. One of most promising game at the moment, and even in this partial release with most of contents missing one of longer.----------------I'm updating my review after ending this very early release with 4/11 avaliable worlds. For a strange bug Steam missed to add a session of almost 2hrs, so it took me >5hrs to do so.This game has many visible bugs, but offer an huge potential as well. It's cleary an unfinished game, and even those 4 worlds only should require at least the triple of the time in a common context. Your own inventory is unneccessary big, because objects are not included yet. Dialogues are super minimal and those worlds almost totally desert, NPGs are rare as diamonds. You expect from a such game a lot of crossed quests, as you can fly in any planet in free order, but almost all (of very few) avaliable quests are in just one direction. Space pirates are just in one level (yes, you can get on board of the pirate ship!). Just one single dungeon. Just one single miner, with an huge planet and lots of units on that. It's full of vehicles without almost anything that justify his usage, the dev insert a wonderful usable mech just for shot a single target!The list of what this game could, and I'm sure will implement is so long. Even without all this stuff, it's one of longer games you can find for VR. This says all, it's a damn big game and when will be ready (I fear it will took a lot) will be seriously time consuming.It's also super WIP and rough, lot of serious bugs just now, if you're looking for polishing wait at least a pair of patches if not the full game. But even as it is now, worth all his price for me, and deserve our best support. If only more users could invest on those projects, maybe we'll see less archery games or wave shooters.Beware: the game is quite comfortable, with a rough but effective artificial locomotion full of options and a teleport The Lab style. Is going to support the Onward locomotion too. Anyway vehicles are super sicknening just now, this had to be solved."

A lot of the menus work well if a little awkward. Also, the number of movement tweaking options is great.The teleport locamotion was fine, but the trackpad movement has a weird delay that makes it jarring. A number of otherdesign choices keep making me feel like Im playing a ported 2d game (lack of hands / arms, resetting the camera, and voiceless characters).I made it about as far as the first vehicle which just kind of glitched in and out and wouldn't move. It sucks, because I love the idea. Sprawling VR sci-fi RPG is the kind of thing I desperately want to see.I want to give a game like this a recommendation based on that potential, but I almost feel like releasing a game this early hurts both the developers and the consumers.Until developers can metaphoricaly look me in the eyes and say, ""What I'm selling you is worth X dollars""  I want to ask developers to keep their games off steam.  What I'm buying has to be at least close to what your final asking price is going to be or someone might end up getting screwed.So that's my metric these days. This game doesn't feel like it's worth what they're asking as it is now. There's tons of potential here, but I'm getting tired of buying that stuff."

But honestly in it's current state, you need a strong stomach and quite a lot of patience to enjoy this.The controls don't feel awfully polished and given i couldn't even pick up the first gun, first mission all i can say is at this point if you wish to buy, you may find some enjoyment, but more so just help the dev honestly. They've gone the ambitious route, which is a lot more promising than a 30 min VR demo."

However, this is the very nature of the term.Reviewed using an HTC Vive and roomscale.Pros:-The mission system is easy to understand. I've never been worried about forgetting where to go next.-Includes the most seamless space-vehicle-ground experience of any VR game I've tried.-The Dev for this came is one of the most active I've seen in any VR game so far. It's one guy, but he's actively engaging with the community and implementing their suggestions. Take a look at the Community board and see for yourself!-Constant improvement. Again, mad props to the dev. The main systems are in place, and content can now be added and adjusted fairly easily.-Includes elements from different genres, including FPS(obviously), RPG, and even the beginnings of a decent RTS system.-Despite later mentioning a general lack of content, there is enough to keep you busy. There are several solar systems available, and after 2 hours I'm only on the second one. The same cannot be said for most EA VR games at this point.Needs work:-Environment interaction. The cities are pretty small and none of the areas can react much to anything you do. It's pretty easy to clip through objects, and I've consistently noticed enemies shooting through walls(meanwhile, my return fire is met with invisible walls poking out of the textured ones).-NPC communication. Basically at this point you just read the text with no say.-Spaceship controls should be reworked. They're pretty unreliable and clunky right now.-Basic details and content are a bit thin, but this WILL change.Note: As I've said, the dev is extremely good with responding to critizism. You find a problem or have an idea, and he's on it. Some parts of this review could be outdated before the end of the month!Overall, I'm truly impressed. Even with the clunky controls and overall lack of polish, the game is improving rapidly enough to be worth the investment for me. I would go as far as to call it a sci-fi, mostly-open-world, story-driven version of Vanishing Realms that's still being polished.If you're looking for a polished game, add this to your wishlist and hold off a few months.If you just want a game that can satisfy your VR content thurst and is attempting aspects few other games have done(and doing it well), this is a great game to mess with.For me personally, the developer's consistent responses and improvements were what won me over, and I don't regret it."

Sure it's super Indie looking. I hadn't really expected much else. There are some kinks to be worked out for sure. Locomotion being chief but thankfully the dev has already announced plans to add in an Onward style locomotion system:http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/234577531178256412There are some other struggles, like knowing where you're supposed to hold your weapons to be able to swap them out or that I wish I could set up my own ship controls. But then you remember that this isn't wave shooter and you're just happy to have something different!!!Joking aside, the first time I got on the speeder and started zooming around, it was great. I started grinning like an idiot while jumping over ridges in the mountains.Part two is a bit rougher around the edges but ends on a high note when we get back on track with questing.If you can overlook some of the EA/Indie dev flaws, there's a gem of an experience here waiting to be polished up. I've been speaking with the dev and he really seems like he genuinely cares about the game and wants to make it better. I hope it gets the support it needs.VR Graphics 6/10 (Not great, not eye cancer)VR Audio 7/10VR Gameplay 8/10 (Buggy but fun. With a little polish this could get bumped up a bit.)Locomotion 7/10Combination of two locomotion modes. Custom track pad movement that works more like an 8 direction D-pad with ""UP"" being wherever you're looking when you start moving. Teleport mechanic.As mentioned above, a locomotion update is otw.Bottom line: I enjoyed myself. I do have an iron stomach though so buyer beware. Know that this is an EA title for a reason. Have reasonable expectations.EDIT: Note from Lupus:""After this next update, the resource planet will be getting some love - bloody turret pickup works great for monitor and Rift, but is a broken mess for Vive - as the Major says - I'm on it!""This is what really makes me want to support the game. He saw a pain point in my video and a fix is planned."

Great plot, geat gameplay, plenty of control options for VR including traditional twin stick locomotion and all done by ONE PERSON! Worth playing for Ms Lotty alone imo. Garry has done an amazing job with this, plenty of content and more on the way. Buy this game, it's awesome! I knew I was onto a winner when the protagonist mentioned the colour of his shirt at the start of the game and I saw that the Pod at the start of the game was the same shape as Mork's egg ship from Mork and Mindy. Brilliant."

The dev is no longer responding in the forums and there hasn't been an update since December. This is very sad as this game had a lot of promise, but that is the risk of EA these days. I can no longer recommend this game to anyone if its going to stay in this state forever. I have left my orignal review below and I do plan on editing this again *IF* it ever rises from the dead.Wow. Just wow. Let me start this off by saying if you have a VR system, this game HAS to be in your library. It is too good to miss out on, even in its early access stage.tl;dr version:Fantastic little experience for VR, and the most content filled and fun game I actually own for VR. Basically its a normal PC game, but you can play it in VR, and this game has SO much potential its incredible!Long-ish version:When I first saw this game pop up I knew I had to buy it. This is like a Star Citizen/Fallout(or Skyrim) in VR, and it is glorious.GAMEPLAY: The AI is very rudimentary, but again this is quite early in the Early Access, and the Dev already has plans to improve it. There is a main story to follow, but basically at one point it opens up to a 'you choose what and where to go' sandbox. With slight RPG elements, and a taste of RTS as well this game is probably my favorite VR game yet, and I plan on playing a LOT more of it.GRAPHICS: Let me start by saying I have only played this in VR, and while you're in the headset, graphics that are horrible don't even look bad. I did notice when I first started up the game though that distant objects looked really jagged, but turning up the AA, to 8 I believe is what I set it at, it fixed it right up. Looking at screenshots and such from monitor, the graphics are ok. Especially for a single Dev.SOUND: This is where the game is lacking. There needs to be some ambient music while flying/driving/walking around. Maybe add some combat music as well. Other sounds are lacking as well, like footsteps of enemies, footsteps of yourself honestly. So this is where I would like to see a bit of improvement.STORY: I'll come back to this when I finish, as I'm only an hour in to the game. So far though, it seems pretty good. There's a menacing enemy faction which I gather is trying to take over the galaxy. You try to stop them. Simple, but effective.Overall this game is really quite good, but it needs work. Some things that don't really bother me could really bother some other people, so do some research before buying, or hell just buy it as its so cheap right now.A really great VR experience especially for such an Early Access title with a SINGLE DEV! I highly recommend this game for anyone who owns a VR system.7/10, a must try"

As of writing, its been more than two months since the last update, and longer since I've seen any communication. With the current state of the vr market with it's many abandoned Early access titles, I can't suggest this one.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I need to start this with the fact that even as it is, the game is interesting and fun to me.That said, It also has quite a few bugs and issues. I've died mutliple times when a turret I set down clipped into me.Pros:Large open areas to explore.Easy gun mechanics that still provide a good feel.Multiple movement options, teleport, blink step, or directional movement.A few different weapons allowing for different play styles.An actual quest system with npcs and rewards.Vehicle system in place that actually feels like you are in a vehicle. I geeked out when I got to pilot a mech.Cons:Dated visuals. Drifts between N64 and Gamecube levels of graphics.Buggy. No point going into what kinds, just to say almost everything has light issues. It is early access, so hey.Horrible flight controls, needs to have multiple optionsSound is not this games forte. When enemies die, it sounds like they did so from behind me. Many sounds seem sourceless.In conclusion only purchase this game if you want to support development and hopefully, as opposed to many early access games see a complete and polished version.I've given it a thumbs up simply because I don't want anyone to dismiss it based on ratings without at least looking at it first.I personally feel that this game is exactly what vr needs right now though, a large scale game that provides exploration and story, not J.A.W.S."

After 2 hours in, I'm only on my first planet. I think there are 3 already in the games current build?The medieval setting world was the the planet I chose to explore first. The landscape is decent and there are variations to flora/fauna. The animal enemies in this realm have such terrible growling sound effects that I couldn't help but to laugh. I kind of hope the developers don't ever change them, because they fit the campy 90s sci fi graphics.I played this game standing. In the medieval setting world, there were definitely places where I could duck for cover from enemies with guns, and peek over to spray enemies with my assault rifle. So yeah, it does roomscale combat decently well.I didn't get motion sickness at all so far, and I have the game set to ""strongest vr legs"" setting. I've tried 4 different forms of in-game mounts. One of the 4 I tried so far was a mecha that could shoot at whatever I was looking at by simply looking at my target and pressing the trigger. I thought that was neat.I remember a few times saying to myself Wow, that's so freaking cool"" when getting into some of the flying vehicles, or a horse. The game provides you many different types of objectives within its first two hours of its campaign. The npc dialogue and the game writer's style is fun and silly at times.I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for a sci fi campaign with varied objectives and room-scale."

This is pretty much the exact kind of game I want from VR. In one moment you can be exploring a small city on an alien planet with various NPC's wandering around, and the next you're hopping into a ship to take off and fight enemy pilots above the planet's surface.It's definitely rough around the edges at the moment, but the ambition of this game is incredible and it delivers as a VR experience in every way. I realise it won't be for everyone, but I highly recommend it for fans of sci-fi, open-world RPGs. With adequate (not great, but certainly not poor) shooting / combat mechanics, it really makes for a compelling experience."

The graphics are decent but it is a Unity game which is not my favorite type. Ureal 4 would have been able make this game look and run better. After learning the controls and menus in the VIVE the experience gets a whole lot better as you go. There is a lot of ice skating in this game if you use the track pad movement and may make some feel ill. The teleport is ok but the distance is too short. In my opinion the limit should be twice the distance at least. There are lots of vehicles to use right now and using them while standing may even be a challenge for even those with the strongest VR legs. I am ok with artificial movement although teleport is just fine for me too but I was still getting some ill feeling from the vehicles. Locomotion has nothing to do with immersion for me. The world I'm in and interacting with it does. I love VR RPGS and open world games so this is right up my alley. The game as I write this needs further optimization. The FPS are definately not 90 a lot of times and I think reprojection is kicking in a lot. Overall, I will rate this a thumbs up and won't refund it as I want this game to continue to develop. If you like sci-fi and open world VR like me then support this. The price right now is worth the potential of this game.P.S.
