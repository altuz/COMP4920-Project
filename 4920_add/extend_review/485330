,Not Recommended,485330,23430233,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,FFIXMaster,"I've been on a real SHMUP kick lately, and when I saw this was available for 50¢ I figured I couldn't go wrong, right? I wish.I'm not even sure where to begin in listing the negatives of this game, let's see... The scanlines on screen make everything super difficult to see, and cannot be turned of; they make the screen overall very dark, since 50% of it is darkened by their presence. This, paired with the overuse of bloom effects makes things on screen appear super super blurry and hazy.The game claims to harken back to the old days of space shooters eating your quarters all day in the arcade, boasting ""hard, very hard"" difficulty, but fails to capture anything close to the same feeling.Firstly, the camera feels zoomed in way too far because the developers thought it was a good idea to make the ship take up a full 1/7th of the vertical screen space while scrolling vertically--why they made a 16:9 game a vertical scroller in the first place is baffling--and on top of that they made the stages larger than the screen actually shows, so you have to push your ship to the edges to force it to move around even more, which brings me to my next point:Absolutely ridiculous deaths from off-screen objects suddenly running directly into your ship because you're trying to move somewhere that things are actually happening. The ""randomly generated"" stages often have huge sections of dead space, with not an enemy in sight... except for their bullets flying at you from the sides or bottom of the screen that you cannot shoot toward. Normally, in an arcade shooter, dead space is nice because it gives you some breathing room, but this game has experience points and gold for on-the-fly upgrades so you can't afford to have 10 seconds of doing nothing but dodging nearly impossible to see shots flying at you way too fast from angles you have no idea there are even enemies at.On the subject of the on-the-fly upgrade system, it is so poorly implemented as to be a joke: They force you to maneuver with the arrow keys, while firing your main weapon with X and secondary weapon with Z, and expect you to, in the middle of a stage, press O to pause the game and open the shop.  And then when you buy new primary and secondary weapons, you're supposed to switch between them with N & M, and < and >, while firing with Z and X and moving with the arrow keys.  None of the controls can be rebound, and there is no controller support. Why did they not use keys nearer to Z and X for these things? Like A/S and D/F? Who knows. Why don't they let you rebind them? Your guess is as good as mine.I am a child of the '80s, I remember going to arcades and playing Galaxian and Galaga, Ienjoyshoot 'em up games and play a wide variety of very difficult ones. This game is bad, and hiding behind ""retro graphics and difficulty"" to shield it from criticism.  It was not even worth the fifty cents I paid for it."
,Not Recommended,485330,25400868,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,peremptor,The only redeeming feature this smhup has is to serve as an example of how not to design a vertical shooter. Just one horrible game that isn't worth your time at any price especially considering how many great SHMUPS are out there on steam and elsewhere for cheaper or free like the sublime Hydorah (google and enjoy).
,Not Recommended,485330,24086373,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Keep moving, nothing to see here.WhileStar Drifterhas some decent pixel art and a low asking price, it doesn't bring anything new to the table, and there are enough small issues to add up to overall badness.Essentially, this is another space-shooter in a sea of space-shooters.Shovel it on the pile with the rest of them. To to go from 'meh' to bad, add in no controller support, sloppy-joe controls, and overall run-of-the-mill mechanics.Pros:+Some of the pixel art is pretty decent. Too bad its often muddied up with that visual filter. This can often make it difficult to discern what is in the foreground (and therefore can hurt you), and what is in the background.+The asking price is low.Cons:-No controller support. This is a big problem for this kind of game.-Lack of options in general; no full screen support, or rebinding of keys, etc.-It suffers from overall lag and poor performance.-Controls are fairly terrible. The ship steers like your grandmother's Buick from the 1950's. There is tons of oversteer and its just not as tight as it needs to be for this genre.-Every mechanic has been done exactly somewhere else; the shop, the energy bar, the primary and secondary guns, etc.-Overall just not fun.I've said it before and I'll say it again - some indie games that are basement homebrew projects can be great fun, but most should really stay in the basement.This is certainly a great title for a small indie company that wants to show proof that they can finish a project to get funded for something more ambitious, but this alone is no gem.Peace,"

As you defeat enemies, \""cash\"" is dropped and you buy upgrades when it says it is available to buy via the indicater on the top left of the screen.Complaints:As of this review, you cannot reassign keys.Menus are chunky;The exit menu while playing the game keeps on going leaving you to do as you exit. (Bug/Exploit: Exitting whle playing will remove all points and level area upon returning, but the lives/levels and upgrades are kept)And navigating the store is a pain, you can\'t fully rotate,even though there is 3 choices. Selecting upgrades via an up/down menu is useful, but when getting on later levels, the bottom isn\'t needed, but when you die, your in the same place where you left off, meaning you have to scroll all the way back down.Also, Many things are red. MANY THINGS! A coin is both yellow and red, with the red one dropping more. You know what looks like a coin? Those slow moving explosive dots that look like a coin with a trail, palette changes would be nice or a new section to say what upgrades do and what to avoid.OverAll:You\'ll get a good hour or two worth of fun in one sitting. Steady and fast gameplay. You could get out of your vechile when it gets downed at some point(Don\'t know how or why). It\'s a vertical shooter, with nice graphics and upgradesAlso Steam Trading Cards, Sell those I guess?"

76561198014665763,Not Recommended,485330,25054676,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,Rufus,"One of the worst games I have ever played. The controls are terrible, and cannot be changed. No gamepad support. The music is generic chip-tunes, and the sound effects are horrible. The graphics are bland and muddy; it's hard to see what's going on, even at full screen (which you have to force with Alt-Enter as it has no option in-game).No tutorial, or any explanation whatsoever. No way to even tell what's a pick-up and what's not, let alone what any of the pickups do.Enemies move in and out of frame too quickly to be shot.Enemy missiles move several times faster than the player's ship, and have the habit of going off-screen and then coming back directly behind, making them impossible to dodge with any reliability.I would not recommend this game no matter how cheap it is. There are far superior games for free on places like Newgrounds; there's absolutely no reason to buy this, unless you particularly want to play a really bad shmup that looks and plays like someone's final year school project."

Collect enough coins you can upgrade your weapons and ship and there are plenty of customizing available in the shop that can be access anytime during in game play.  I also love the retro graphics with scanlines and the overall graphics is just amazing.This game isn't easy and you will die a lot.  I like the challenge and the difficulty level is just right for a shmup fan.There's no gamepad support at the moment but Devs are working on it.  Lucky for me I have a Steam Controller and able to map KB input.Also edit your S3DClient.cfg file to enable Fullscreen and set resolution.

Though I was a child of the 90s, thanks to a few local arcades that lovingly struggled to continue to exist during my childhood, I'm intimately familiar with the experience of playing the types of 80s arcade games this was meant to reproduce. It fails in soooooo many ways. FFIXMaster pretty much sums it all up in their scathing review. I bought the game at a very low cost but don't enjoy it at all. I probably won't be playing it again unless the developer takes some of the criticism in that review to heart and makes adjustments."

What a novel concept !In other news...Audiovisuals are the well known ""retro"" fad, but the weird scanline effect makes everything blurry and just...bleh..Much like the enemy ship design, which is just uninspired and bland. Ship controls are sloppy and awkward with your ship drifting to the side a bit once you stop pressing a key. There's also a side-scrolling effect, which always seems to pull your ship towards the center of the screen when you stop moving for a bit.Half the time I didn't even know what's a pickup, an enemy, just...background or a bullet. It all just meshes into one clusterflak of things on your screen and with you trying to fly over them, either picking them up, not interacting with them at all or dying :pOh and the keys are not rebindable, which is especially great for Germans like me, who have to deal with an Y X instead of a Z X layout -_-"

,Not Recommended,485330,34717707,Posted: 3 September,all,Nucular,"Star Drifter is a great space SHMUP if you want to waste some time killing endless waves of enemies with impunity. That's right, if this game is ""super hard"" then I'm a unicorn. You start the game with like 10 lives and as the game progresses, the screen becomes literally littered with extra life and health power-ups. The options are limited, as are instructions, and I spent most of the time trying to tell power-ups from incoming enemy fire and figuring out what the different power-ups do. The keys cannot be rebound and bascailly consist of the entire bottom row of the keyboard (Z to /), with M/N and ,/. used to cycle through weapons. If you have three hands, it's probably very convenient. There is a shop to buy new weapons, ships, and upgrades, but it is not clear if upgrades stack and you need to buy all of them, or just the most expensive ones. Likewise, weapons do not seem to get progressively more powerful as the cost increases and seem to mostly do the same amount of damage. Buying different ships seems to be purely cosmetic and requires re-purchasing all of the ship upgrades. From time to time a boss appears and the game tells you ""Stage Complete,"" but the game just keeps going and there is no indication which stage you are currently on. All in all, Star Drifter just made me feel lost, so I guess at least the name is appropriate. About an hour in I got bored of holding down the fire button and decided that I have beat the game because there were more extra life power-ups floating by than there are stars in the sky and there was no way I could ever lose."
