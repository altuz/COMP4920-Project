It’s a short kinetic (with no choices, you only read the story) VN with interesting graphics and awesome music. I never thought that these kinds of graphic would fit on a game like this, but they did. The story and characters are simple, but I could feel sympathy for them; it’s funny how you can meet a new person on a normal day, and that person might start to have an impact in your life.I just wished the ending was a bit longer…About the Portuguese translation, I only saw one mistake: near the end, Sveta says “disonesto”, when the actual word is spelled “desonesto”. Also, it was refreshing to read a VN in my native language!I wish all the luck to these developers, and I hope they can make more VNs like this one. This was a huge improvement over One Manga Day.7/10."

And that being the case, this ""novel"" needs to be judged on its writing, which is fairly predictable, since all of the characters are stereotypes and the plot holds no surprises.Not bad, but boring."

It evokes its mood well, and the characters are likeable. However, there are no choices (technically making it a ""kinetic novel""). You get the ""achievements"" just by playing through the story. Even Without Within had a few ""wrong choice = game over"" moments, and that one's free! So, I'm notupsetor anything, but I just can'trecommendit..."

It has a clever and unique visual style and I could associate with the sentiments expressed within the story. I genuinely wanted to play through until the end.A cheap but meaningful purchase.

Characters are nice and easily relatable.The game displays the undervalue of stress caused by basic rules of our society and the importance of mutual support. An easy laid-back read accompanied by relaxing music and interesting graphics."

So let's get to the point.""Winter Novel"" is a Visual Novel available for 1,99 euros. Do I think is worth it? Well, if you're really into this kind of genre go ahead, but if you've never seen a game like this before, try to get a discount that comes with the Steam leveling up system.It's a really creative novel, the design is so original and the music just keeps you focused on the astonishing story that goes around the first job, stress, friendship and greediness.Overall, I will give this game a 7.5 out of 10.P.S.: Don't buy the game to get up your percentage of achievements. Sit back and enjoy.Have Fun, Haise"

It uses an older style of graphical picture creation (which might give you a headache). It is also a bit sweet, and ends just as a relationship might be about to take off. (Personally, this appears to me to be the beginning of a love relationship between the two protagonists.)For achievement hunters, just start the game and progress from beginning to end, and all will unlock. And just keep the game running for long enough for the Trading Cards, if they strike your interests."

The difference is in a kinetic novel there is no choices, it's like a picture book. So they should point that out. It has a slow story, but the art is what drew me into this. It's really cool because if you back up to the other side of the room what was once text and color makes a beautiful picture. I didn't like it so much, it wasn't for me. However for people who like slow slice of life kinetic novels it should be brilliant. Also for achievement hunters sinceif you just hold down shift the whole story flys away and you get all the achievements..."

,Recommended,485350,30808503,Posted: 29 March,all,Poi,"It was a pretty good 42 minutes of my life reading this. The story was predictable, but it was pretty interesting nonetheless. Maybe it was because the whole visual novel is made with highlighted and colored text (that was something). Anyways, 10 achievements, cards, and about 30-60 minutes of reading was pretty nice. I guess I might reread this if I literally have nothing else to do with my life. I would probably just read something like ""If My Heart Had Wings"" or one of the ""Nekopara"" games instead though.The songs were looped but I somehow managed to basically ignore the music..."
,Recommended,485350,30042032,Posted: 19 February,all,Smile Junkie,"I absolutely enjoyed this game. It only costed me 49 cents but it was all well-worth it for a decent Sunday afternoon.It's not something spectacular mind you, it's okay - the art as seen on the screenshots is rather unusual for the genre, the music is limited, but not too repetitive. The setting is what caught my eye. It perfectly well presents its characters - their daily live, their daily struggles and their thought process.For a visual novel at this price it's a work well-done."

I don't think it's something I'll totally recommend, and yet it's not something I dislike.The story was fairly predictable, the characters were simple stereotypes. I did enjoy it, though. Too bad it only lasted 30 minutes.I think the soundtrack was really nice, and the whole ASCII aspect of the game makes it unique; it's a shame that it's wasted on a story like this.If you're interested, you should get it on sale, I got my copy for less than 40 cents."

While I couldn't call Winter Novel a 'game' by any stretch of the imagination - from start to finish you simply press the 'enter' key - it had a good narrative, and there were very few errors in the text. Also, the male and female protagonists felt authentic and provoked sympathy.I received this title at a discount, and recommend buying it when it is on sale."

It IS interactive fiction. And ordinarily I despise these games, I would much rather read one of the Disney brand ""choose your own adventure"" books which I grew out of around the age of 8 (incidentally around the time I started gaming:).But this is an exception as I personally liked both the story and the ANSI style art. I will not spoil them for you, besides you are reading the same description in the Steam Store that I did so you should know if this also applies to you or not simply by looking at the same bloody information I did when I thought 'this looks like it might not completely suck like most interactive fiction games, I'll give it a whirl'.And the music was not bad either, but it did seem to change from one track to another at wierd points half-way through scenes and not when the plot took a turn as one might expect it to, and while I did like the tunes I might have liked more of them. Anyway...The word ""interactive"" is a bit of a misnomer unless you would count the act of turning the page in a regular, linear book to be interaction. I cannot recommend it as a game as there is no actual gameplay to be found here as far as I can tell, and this is a games store!But then if you are just looking for a nice little piece of narrative fiction to read before you go to bed it is absolutely recommended and you should get it anyway. Just don't expect to be making any difficult decisions or anything, all you really do is read the story, listen to the music and admire the artwork.Honestly I was kind of relieved that I did not have to agonise over any seemingly trivial dialogue choices or anything like that, and while the story will never change from one playthrough to the next I will be reading it again soon.Oh, and it kind of supports a controller, but then it kind of does not. But that's all irrelevant when all you need to do to ""play"" this ""game"" is PLOKTA! (Press Lots Of Keys To Abort- Old hacker jargon:)Not recommended as a game, but absolutely recommended as a somewhat anti-capitalist themed romantic comedy.And I normally hate that genre of fiction too, so the authors must have done something right to appeal to a bitter and cynical old♥♥♥♥♥♥like me. And I did actually laugh out loud at more than one point, I was not exactly rolling on the floor, but a couple of lines made me go ""hah!"", and a few others made me chuckle a bit.7.2/10 - If there was a game to go with the presentation then this would have scored at least one whole point higher.If my boss tried any of this♥♥♥♥♥♥with me in Australia then I would punch him in the face, take his money out of his wallet and then sue the  p r i c k  for unfair work practices if he dared go to the cops and try to say I assaulted or robbed him.I might do a couple of months in prison if he called my bluff, but then he would probably get financially crippled by the courts for breaking the labour laws, so who is the loser in that situation?But I'm guessing that Russian(?) employees might not be quite so lucky as us Aussies when it comes to labour laws, I certainly would never treat my contractors like that. Quite the contrary, just ask my Art Editor Christoff. ""Take all the time you need mate"" ""Good work"" ""You are our star player"" and so on, I would say, but then I don't operate a bank! Maybe the rules are different for bankers!"

Don't expect any replay value or deep gameplay, it's story based and not much else. Worth buying, especially if on sale, has a short and beautiful story book type experience. Could have been a bit longer though, I wish they would've expanded on the game more as well, maybe allowing the player to make meaningful choices or doing something to keep the players more engaged."

It's so much better to read a book or play a game...But, how to pay the bills then?A very simple, mundane story about very common people: the web developer and bank clerk. What makes them to leave their shells is a project they both have to finish in a week time.The game is based on visual novel style, but offers no decision making. And it's ok. You don't need to make decisions all the time. The graphics are made out of ASCII symbols and fits unexpectedly well with the story, giving a little fuzzy, cozy look. The music is really atmospheric too, filling all pictures with a depth, I wasn't expecting. Who thought that capturing the silence of falling snow would only need a simple chiptune and text-based image?It's a short story, a simple game. But less is more. So get your warm tea ready, sit down, relax and enjoy.Seriously, that's all you need sometimes."
