76561198083871385,Recommended,485360,31314221,Posted: 23 April,all,Seandginley,"There are so many little indie games out there with the technical sophistication of an RPG maker product claiming ""nostalgia"" for the old days of simple turn based RPGs... Which, man, I am nostalgic for, not gonna lie... I like a good action game as much as the next guy, but it confuses me that the demand for something that only moves when I do seems gone... (does no one else have jobs they come home tired from? I'm not always up to test my twitch reflexes after a long day...). That said, while it's all but a dead genre on consoles, as I mentioned, Steam is just flooded with titles like this, and unfortunately, most are just uninspired flak. So how to tell what's killer and what's filler?Well, can't help you with that problem on an ongoing basis, but if you'd care to get at least one you're likely to enjoy, this is near the top of my list for what I'd reccomend.The system is simple and straightforward mechnically, yet also pleasantly original and well developed. Experiment with a wide vareity of stats, skills, background, and equipment for your main character, before adapting your decisions to your greater party, then making decisions based on your leadership of an army in resource distribution, capitalizing on your fame, commission construction, passing down policy commands... In terms of visuals and story, I'd be lying if I said that was original enough for me on it's own... but while hard to quantify what it is setting this game ahead of the pack, it scratches my itch for its sort of experience the way ostensibly ""similar titles"". While I'm not played out on this one yet, I definitely am enoying Disgraced enough that By next time I want somethin else a long these lines, I'll look to Corrosive Srtudios other works first, I think"

I already voted a ""Yes"" on Greenlight before, so I got the message  and decided to buy the game because I was curious and wanted to play something new, something I usually don't play.When it came out it was maybe a little rough around the edges but everything necessary seemed to be working OK (once I figured out how to do things in the game, because it does not hold your hand so it was a bit challenging for me at the start as I never played anything alike before).So, we'll do the Pro's and Con's thing below here:Pro's:- Feudal Japan setting (nice!)- Level design has been well taken care off- Once you figure out how the menu's work (that's probably because of my lack of knowledge of these games) it works really well- Awesome developer that really takes note of his community- Regular updates- Good to know that this studio already released a finished game on Steam (Waste Walkers)Con's:- The diagonal walking still seems weird and is faster than horizontal/vertical walking (just an annoyance as I keep bumping into stuff when I thought I'd go around)- NPCs sometimes block your passage/entrance (just arrived to Beta, so I'm sure this is being fixed, too)- I would like to see that if I equipe a helmet or something, I would actually see it on my character so I can become the biggest bad*** Samurai-***kicking Rebel of Feudal Japan :)So, conclusion: My con's are pretty much some minor problems that can be expected from an Alpha and Beta phased game. For those that loved Waste Walkers: Buy into it now, it's fun!For those that love the setting: Buy into it now, it's fun!And last but not least, those people like me that want to play ""something else"" and like the Feudal Japan setting: Buy into it now, it's fun!Another sneaky ""pro"" (shhh don't tell anyone!): Put the game on windowed mode and it easily pauses behind the word/excel document you're working sooooo hard on the moment your boss walks in ;)"

76561198080268954,Recommended,485360,30323329,Posted: 4 March,all,Smoky,Wow my god this game isn't screwing around. Right off the bat you're thrown into a world of people that are a lot more powerful than you. There is also no respawn system for any companions so I have to live with myself after getting my teammate killed while going to test the base strength of enemies in this game. If you don't be incredibly careful you'll get your whole team killed and even yourself really easily.Not sure yet if that's a pro or a con but I will weap for the first companion guy who was assigned to help me. ;_; I got him killed immediately in that stupid bandit camp next to the spawn town. R.I.P. guy whose name I forgot.Although it is very difficult I want to see where this goes so I will reccomend it until I feel otherwise.

,Recommended,485360,33881529,Posted: 29 July,all,Scout Shine,"Entertaining enough and just about worth the price, especially if bought on sale. It's enjoyable enough. Don't expect anything too in depth in terms of mechanics, items, quests or the storyline. It's rather basic really. However, it's bug free, it works and there's some stuff to discover and some options for customisation. If you're looking to kill a day or two then Disgraced is acceptable."
,Recommended,485360,25388850,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Grimswolf,"It's been a bit rough since the first alpha, but Disgraced is starting to pull together. It's not content complete yet, but most of the features are already in game.What makes Disgraced different from more basic RPG Maker games includes:Reasonably challenging combat - As you level up and choose skills you will become considerably more powerful, but especially early on you'll find yourself challenged by many enemies. You only gain hit points via taking certain skills and stats, not every level, keeping combat often quick and brutal.Equipment degradation - Similar to Fallout 3 every piece of equipment you own can degrade with use. You need to bring it to the blacksmith for repairs regularly, but not so often it becomes a chore.Survival elements - You have a provisions meter that decreases as you move about the world and particularly when you sleep which is also how you save. You'll want to sleep save often as you gauge which battles to avoid, but doing so  too often will strain your provisions.Limited base building - Not as complex as a sim type game by a long shot, but the element is there. At different points in the game you can spend four basic resources to build different improvements or take other actions that benefit your cause.It's still a bit rough around the edges. Writing is eh, but the gameplay is better than the writing. As of now (September '16, now in Beta) it looks like there's still content to be added to finish the game, a few bugs to work out and points to be polished, but you can get a fair idea of what the full game should be. Developer is quick to respond to bug reports too. Case in point, he just now replied to a post I made two minutes ago."

It is simple yet fun, and i do not regret buying this. I like the turn based combat, the different techniques, and that different weapons are strong against different kinds of enemies. The fact where you get to upgrade and build up your great rebel army appeals to me, and i really enjoyed that a lot!Though there are some things you could improve on, such as giving more customizational option, longer sidequests, and maybe even a longer story. I had fun capturing the 3 cities, but thats all you do. Capture cities then the main one. I was hoping for a long story but i still was satisfied with the purchase. You could also make the game harder, it was quite easy for me once i gained a lot of fame, and i wish you could build different kinds of bases in different areas of your choice, and upgrade it from that point.Overall, it is a good game and has massive potential. The story is very nice and i enjoy the music a lot. I also like the fact that if your ally dies, they die for good and theres nothing to get them back (Unless if you create a new game or reload from last save file) I would definitely recommend this to a friend who is looking for a roleplaying game :)"

76561198114438586,Recommended,485360,23671974,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,NinjaFoxMaster,This is a early access review. But already i am excited about the future of this game. First impression the things i liked about it. I am one who has always loved the edo period samurais and ninjas and it has both automatic victory in my book. And then to add base building as well which is rare in most RPG's is a welcome change that i have enjoyed. Now on to the combat there is alot to the way you go about battles cause if you mess up you could lose allys to Death a way i learned the hard way so it is best to get very strong before fighting enemy's. And there is a lot of ways to do that you can hire a drill instructor and have him train you in exchange for Yen in game currency and upgrade your base to give you more stats like crit chance there is also skill's that can be upgraded just like in Waste Walkers another great game by this Dev. But as stated before this is early access there will be much more in the future. But other than that i myself haven't found anything i don't like about this game it has great Promise and i Can't wait to see what is next :).

,Recommended,485360,23670973,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,SirReeceo[Youtube] hellcase.com,"So I bought the game and streamed it and it'll be going on youtubehttps://www.twitch.tv/reecedow&https://www.youtube.com/user/ReeCeDoWSo if you want to see the game as it was and how it has improved.11/8/16_______So to update this; the game itself is starting to become a whole lot better, and a bit more easier for a player like myself.  Massive improvements are; more quests, more exploration spots, more companions, and posisbly more random events.  There is one con I found when playing the game at its state right now, but I'm sure you can spot it in the next episode of disgraced I'll release on the 17th/Aug/2016 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIzhCExAr40]20/6/16________Early Release review - As a early release review this is the first initial look at the game - So playing this  game and it honestly has so much more potential than the previous game Waste Walkers, the game is set in a old time Japan with a rebelion, there's not much to it as of yet, but knowing the developer the game will be made into something amazing (so really worth paying for it right now for an amazing game later on).  So there's a duration of weapons and armor that adds a bit of realism and difficulty for the player as you will need to spend a little bit of money to repair your equipment or get a new set.  There is also a building system, this will require you to get the items/inflence to do specific tasks to improve your base and gain new companions.  As of now the map is very bare and with only a small handful of quests just to tease the game to the player it is easily taken, however this game is intended to be quite difficult proving that you can't simply run head first into fights without making sure you've done what you've needed to.

Gameplay and battle are fun, character development while still short on making the main character as a persona or memorable character had so much promise in the skills and techniques development, this part maybe what really makes the game interesting. I dont really understand the provision menu, i think i need to study around base management a bit more, well it is quite annoying but i understand this part might be important to the overall story, maybe make this a little bit simpler or insert more infos on which does what?Healing is really frustrating. but quite okay.Overall, im optimistic and glad buying this early access.Stumbled on this game while browsing around the store, installed at 2 am so still no time to enjoy the game. However, at first glance, the gameplay seems so interesting, story is compelling at the start, not sure mid and end game though,Oh yeah, i played this with one eye closed due because im so sleepy, thought it was gonna be ez, ended up dead on the first battle.

,Not Recommended,485360,29052219,Posted: 5 January,all,ArtemisHunt,"EDIT: Looking at the comment thread here (and the developer's comments on other games) we also see that the developer likes to tell people that their reviews are 'Incorrect' if they're negative.This game is total garbage.Oops, did I spoil the review a little early? Should I have put in all of the negative points first? Well, probably, but people on the internet have short attention spans for long review posts. They probably only look for the yea/nay and call it a day. Anyway, Disgraced is a total disgrace (see what I did there?). Let me explain.Disgraced is an RPG Maker game, and RPG Maker games are already a plague on the Earth because of their terrible graphics and awful copy/pasta scripts but this game goes way beyond that. First, let's talk about the introduction. To introduce you to the game, Disgraced copies George Lucas. That is, they do the text scroll thing like in Star Wars. Which by itself... can be excused... maybe. Put some ambient music behind it, have scenes playing in the background, sure. I could live with that. I wouldn't like it, I think it's lazy, but I could live with it. This game just runs text up a black screen with way too much blank space between lines. You ever program? Imagine like 40 newlines between every line of code. Obnoxious and terrible execution.The plot of the game is that you are a deserter that gets conned into leading a rebellion. Your qualification for this seems to be - you are a deserter. You didn't kill the guy you were working for. You ran like a little girl. Your task is to 'liberate' (hostile takeover) three cities and gather enough support to take on Kyoto. You do this by walking all across Japan and going to every town. You need to gather the support of villages (usually via bribery) because you're not allowed to attack the cities unless you have enough support.Get enough support, fight samurai death squads, and beat the Shogun. Sounds awesome, right? Well, it's not. The combat in this game has to some of the most poorly balanced combat I've ever seen. You will miss almost every single attack. You have two (2!) health bars to manage Vitality and Morale. If you run out of Vitality you die and if you run out of Morale you desert.♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's the same damn thing for the purpose of combat. May as well dump all your points in Vitality because my Morale never dropped below two-thirds.And you best make all of the offerings to RNGsus because if you take a single crit you may as well reload your save because that person is likely dead. Like, dead dead. No revivals. Normally this wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. After all, Fire Emblem does it too. But Fire Emblem's RNG isn't terrible. But combine that with the fact that your party does NOT level together, losing your level 7 dude with only level 1 goons to replace him means grinding or (in my case) reloading your save. And it wouldn't be so bad but every attack (barring one skill, I think) is single-target. You have 3 people, they will almost always have 5. Which means you get 3 attacks a turn and they get 5. Combine that with the terrible RNG and you get a game in which combat is cancer. The SFX are too loud and the BGM is non-existent. Well, it's there but even at max volume you can hardly hear it. Isn't really any good either.In fact, if I had to pick two words to describe this game, they would be 'Needlessly Complicated'. There are so many skills (which again, many are functionally useless because who needs morale?) that leveling up certain skills makes you wonder where the newb traps are. The stats you level up (probably) don't matter. I only ever leveled up 'Might' and I swept the game just fine. The resource management is also needlessly complicated, and serves only as means to bribe the villages to assist in your cause. This support manifests itself only by resources you supposedly collect once a day but I'm not sure that collection ever happened. You can collect a ton of allied units but because of the problem I mentioned above, there's no reason to. Just use your first three goons to sweep the game (that's what I did anyway).The choices you make have zero impact on the game. I could've sworn I saw 'Choices matter' somewhere associated with this game. They don't. Don't waste your time. Press space through every dialogue, there's nothing of value there. One you get some money rolling and can afford decent equipment (highest damage/accuracy) you can win any battle by killing enemies in one or two hits. This drastically improves your 3v5 situation to 3v3 or 3v2.Let's take a quick look at the map design. The game uses stock sprites from RPG Maker (exclusively, I think). And you can really tell because the wolf sprite doesn't have the same style as some of the box sprites (among other things). And while this is terrible by itself, it becomes much, much worse when you don't make it clear what you can walk through and what you cannot. Combine this with narrow passages and an NPC that stands LITERALLY IN YOUR WAY then navigating towns becomes insufferable.This game is not worth $10; this game is not worth $1. It's a short game (takes, maybe 4 hours to clear?) and you will not enjoy it. I guarantee it."
