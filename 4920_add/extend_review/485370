,Not Recommended,485370,31705950,Posted: 12 May,all,Darkslayer16,I bought it on sale a while ago and just got around to trying it. The game is atrocious.The vehicles are pointless because you can destroy them before they are even remotely close to you.It makes no sense to use any other weapon besides the RPG or sniper rifle because they are useless.The only people playing it have insanely high ping (300-5000).Worst if all it's mind numbingly boring.

(AFK)","With a dead community and little shine to show, I come into Mad Combat Marines expecting nothing. I recieved nothing.People do play this mind you, but literally none of them would be worth gaming with. The acievements provided can be triggered without the help of other players. One could make a lobby and solo 1000 points before dinnertime. The AI is terrible. I mean horrid. I stood completely still and only an NPC with a launcer could drop me. That aoe. It has vehicles, but I don't see the point. Even trying to run a person down bounces like nothing ever happened. Everything has noclip. Small trees and a big (ish) open world with nothing in it to do but await events and....yeah. Combat is sluggish and the controls are bare. Little to no editing can be done for sensitivity issues or visuals pre-launch.I like what it was aiming for, but 2016 was the year of the Hero Shooter, this is a sad shadows reflection wanting and trying. I doubt this will recieve any major updates, re-works or content. Buy only for steam badges."
,Recommended,485370,35244492,Posted: 27 September,all,Kovic,"You know what?Even though this game is very basic and the main server appears to be located somewhere in the Atlantic, it's a pretty entertaining game for $0.99.The achievements are simple to get, with the 200 kill acheivement being a bit of a grind since not many people play this, but you can just do the single player with A.I.   The A.I. players have surprisingly good aim, heck, I even got spawn killed a few times by them. =PThe game itself seemed to run okay, it could use optimization and I did glitch through a few walls, I even jump near the side of a building and shot up into the sky.  However, for the price of this game, I have no problem recommending it to those looking for an easy 100% or simply a low quality, yet very colorful, version of a multiplayer shooter game.Who knows, if the game could actually get a good amount of people playing, it may be a decent time killer in between other games.The added bonus is the sniper rifle is not over powered, so campers on rooftops have to hit you a couple times, giving you a chance to evade.  However, the Shotgun, oh boy, talk about one shot carnage.  Also, if you play the game a lot and earn enough kills, you can unlock other outfits.  Personally I think these outfits should just be available to everyone from the start."

There were only three at the time when I was playing, all of which had only 1-3 people playing on each. In a matter of seconds after joining one I was blasted by a man wielding a rocket-launcher, and saw the same guy type in chat something around the lines of ""ecks dee ecks dee.""Honestly, I give this game a 7/10 since the achievements are a piece of cake, there's trading cards, and because I bought it for $0.11. After collecting the seven achievements and receiving all three trading cards (which takes about 80 minutes of gameplay in total, most of which I spent eating cereal doing nothing ingame), I don't think any normal person would come back to this game for casual play."

,Recommended,485370,25449533,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,Frizzle Fry,"DO NOT PAY $2.99 FOR THIS GAME.MCM is not a good game. It's not even a mediocre game. Pure and simple, this is a Unity asset-flip with very little work put into it, and it's bad... not that special kind of humorously bad that's almost good (say, Bad Rats or Leisure Suit Larry) but the kind of bad in which gameplay has no intrinsic value whatsoever.DO NOT PAY $2.99 FOR THIS GAME.MCM is an online multiplayer 3rd person shooter. It features 3 mid-size maps, 6 character sprites with multiple color choices, and 6 weapons. There are drivable vehicles with four different sprites and identical function (or lack thereof). Gameplay consists of a free-for-all battle between players and AI (sort of) with one kill equaling one point - more points put you higher on the leaderboard, and allow you to use more sprites or color options for your character. Random ""events"" add some variety to game play, but they're as flavorless as you'd expect given the basic gameplay. All weapons are accessible to all players at all times and have limited ammunition depending on the gun.DO NOT PAY $2.99 FOR THIS GAME.When you begin playing, you customize your character, then either host or select a server with 2-10 players. Server options include allowing ""events"", allowing RPG weapons, allowing vehicles, and allowing AI.Events occur randomly (sometimes every few minutes, other times not for a half hour) and award XP/Kills to the winner. There are several types; Demolition (points awarded for destroying the most vehicles during a limited time period), Driver (points awarded for continuously driving a vehicle more than competitors, in increments of 30 seconds, during a limited period), Killer (points awarded for killing the most players/AI during a limited time period) and Rich (points awarded for collecting the most floating coins, roughly 10 spawn, during a limited period). Events award between 40 and 150 XP/Kills, and there is an achievement for winning just one. Events do not seem to occur when there is only one player on a server.RPGs are just what you'd imagine; a rocket propelled grenade gun which every player spawns with (unless they are deactivated on the server). It takes 2-3 hits to destroy a vehicle, and 1 direct hit to kill an enemy. Splash damage is low, so it may take as many as 4 near-hits to kill an enemy player, and you only spawn with 6 shots - there are no ammo pickups. Fear not, every time you die and respawn you recieve a full load of ammunition.Vehicles are... something. They handle identically (bad) despite there being several sprites, which consist of Generic Red Supercar, Generic Black Import Sports Car, Generic Blue Domestic Sports Car, and Police Cruiser Mustang. Vehicles are controlled with the WASD keys and spacebar brake, and the camera angle cannot be changed with the mouse; just follow-behind when moving forward. Hit ""S"" for reverse, and the camera angle slowly flips as you accelerate. Hitting an opponent at 50% speed or higher will kill them, but it will also sharply stop your vehicle. Hitting an opponent in a vehicle does no damage, but will result in A) one car, yours or theirs, slowly flipping over, or B) one car, yours or theirs, flying into the air. The handling is purely 50s Caddillac - fast in a straight line, but god help you if you want to take a corner or turn around.AI is pisspoor. Every server with AI enabled gets a single AI player, which marches around at crawling speeds (I can't seem to make my own character walk that slowly) and chooses a random weapon with which to fire at opponents. Sometimes it pulls a sniper rifle and misses every shot, other times it pulls a pistol and is a damn marksman. AI is a good way to farm kills between events (there are two score/kill based achievements) but can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when they spawn with a rocket launcher and surprise you, or snatch up event coins.DO NOT PAY $2.99 FOR THIS GAME.The ugly... What's broken? Everything, I guess. I'll give them this; gameplay is extremely balanced.The weapons are crap, but everyone has the same guns. The skins for the pistol, shotgun, and machinegun are nearly identical so you'll only know which one you have in your hand based on the poorly-placed weapon selector at the top of your HUD. The Sniper and RPG skins look to have been ""borrowed"" from vastly different games than the other skins.Your pistol has a low ROF, 10rd magazine, and seemingly endless supply of ammo - you will NEVER use it, so don't worry about it.The shotgun is slightly faster than the pistol, also features a 10rd magazine, and a similarly almost-endless supply of ammo. A headshot from close up is hard to achieve, but is an instant kill. Body shots do about 20% damage. The physics of the spread seem like a straight line with a steep drop; this weapon cannot be used at range, you'll see the bullet drop.The machinegun is very fast, with a 32rd magazine, terrible accuracy, and loads of ammunition. Running any spraying a full magazine while within 10ft of an opponenet will result in 4-5 bullets hitting. By stopping completely, and ""scoping in"" and firing in bursts, you may kill a full-health opponent with one magazine. Expect to get into ""spray wars"" where you and another player dance around each other in a race to reload.The sniper rifle is almost useless, with a 5rd magazine, limited ammunition, and pisspoor accuracy unscoped and scoped alike. Two shots to the head to kill a full-health opponent, three or four to the torso. This gun is useless; running and gunning, you cannot hit enemies - at range, both you and the enemy must be standing still and scoped in to land a hit.The RPG is a double-edged sword, but you'll see it used a lot. You get 6 rockets per spawn, and if you play your cards right you'll destroy cars in 2 hits and players in 1 hit. The rockets have some hang time - shooting a distant target, you'll miss if it moves. Most players rocket spam and hope for the best; they're easy targets, as splash damage is low.DO NOT PAY $2.99 FOR THIS GAMESo... if you didn't TL;DR you're probably wondering why I ""recommend"" this game. Sounds like a real piece of crap, yeah? Well, I recommend it for some players based on the price, coupon deal, card drops, and ease of achievements. For achievement hunters, card collectors, or those looking to boost their Steam level, you can't lose.PRICE: $2.99 is the base price. I bought it for $0.30 with a 90% Steam coupon. That's one more library game, which counts towards game collector badges...CARDS: I dropped 3 cards by idling. Total market value, $0.34 after fees; a $0.04 profit. The cards hover around $0.10 but fluctuate. Complete the badge for cheap, or sell your cards for a profit.ACHIEVEMENTS: As mentioned, I idled for the first 3hr of gameplay. I have 5 hours on the game now and have ALL of the achievements (100% complete) and I'm somehow ranked #10 in the WORLD. A+"
