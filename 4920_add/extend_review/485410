,Not Recommended,485410,29800368,Posted: 9 February,all,NishiLion,It's not very good and it is kind of bad so. You don't do much. It's a slow paced runner with goal based levels. There isn't much to it besides switching lanes and jumping etc.2/10 Jogs

So I'll start with my likes of the game. First off the style of the game is very unique, i dont remeber the last time I've seen this type of platforming. Another like is there are unique enemies for each world/stage. But the dislikes outweigh the likes. Well to start off, I hate how there was no music. I don't know if the music in the trailer was supposed to play but if it was, I couldn't hear it. Another audio dislike is the sound effects were very lacking. There weren't any special sfx for enemies, boss fights, or even just for actions. This game just feels rushed, most of the backgrounds are simple, some have clouds mocving back and forth rapidly, this game is just rushed."
