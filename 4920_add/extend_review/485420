The world to explore has great possibilities in its own, as well as how interactions can occur. If this game would get a (fairly big) polish, it would be amazing. If the dev team doesn't step up I honestly pray some talented mod makers do the job.

,Not Recommended,485420,27323024,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,RoxyWolf,"Please don't buy this game. I refunded it after seven minutes. It's unplayable.Allow me to preface this by saying that I have no problem playing games that are in development; I have no problem playing games that are objectively bad, as long as they're playable and fun in some way! But Wolf Simulator isn't just completely un-fun to play and ugly to look at, it's a crash-prone nightmare that doesn't even have a functional loading screen! I'll break down my seven minutes of experience with this game:For starters, you can't access the menu to start the game unless your resolution is 1920x1080... windowed. Any other resolution and the game hangs at the ""primarily funded by"" screen, utterly unplayable. I only learned that there WAS a way to progress past the opening intro through other reviews here. If the developers can't even fix this major, glaring, game-breaking issue, what CAN they fix?As if that gross oversight on the developer's part wasn't enough, the menus have mislabeled options! And even worse, there are even more VERY OBVIOUS bugs there -- to select a white wolf, you have to actually click below the options box because the radial buttons aren't aligned properly! The text for the two wolf classes is inversed from what their names imply, so I honestly have no idea what I was playing as. The menu is honestly a hot mess that crashed when I attempted to name my wolf on top of everything else.Once I jumped through the hoops of trying to get this game to run, I finally got the chance to PLAY! I was hoping the game would redeem itself on the gameplay elements if nothing else -- but then the game crashed a second time. Nonetheless, I pressed on and finally made it into the game proper -- and it was terrible, too. The controls are like... tank controls on ice? The keybinds are weird, and as far as I could find there was no way to rebind them. My wolf was ugly and moved awkwardly anyway, and the environment was okay, but nothing really that spectacular.Then the game crashed again, and I decided enough was enough.So I implore you once again -- please don't get Wolf Simulator. This game is terrible on every level; it literally fails in every aspect you would expect from a game. It's physically unplayable, bug-filled and prone to crashing, and even if you suffer through that... the gameplay is a hot mess with lackluster visuals. There are simply no redeeming qualities to be found here. I have never been driven to refund a game before, but this game is the absolute definition of a waste of money.Wolf Simulator is broken. Stay away!"

,Not Recommended,485420,34501597,Posted: 26 August,all,JolanXBL,"I enjoy low-rated games for the potential of a 'diamond-in-the-rough', or even something I'll enjoy. I think many users can be a bit too picky, and some will even up or down-vote for the lulz.Going with the classic Pro's & Con's format today, with a conclusion statement at the end.Keep in mind that I have not explored the map further than the first couple of missions. I did however figure out how to attack things so that's already an improvement over some of the other reviews :).*You attack by clicking (note: Mashing) only when your face is at the target*PROs:>You are indeed a wolf, in a forest. You have a pack, and rpg-like stats.>There is hunting, sort-of, and at least 1 bear.>There are at least 2 people camping that you can kill for fun, but no noticeable profit.>If you eat another wolf, you get the Cannibalism achievement.>You can only attack when there is something to attack (Duh).CONs:>Your pack is your family, and are stationary NPC's. Your father provides you with quests.>The boar runs in a straight line between 2 points, roughly, and is faster than the Warrior.>It's good that you can run through the trees as there are invisible rocks to get stuck on.>When you return to your father after securing the first territory, the quest does not end and the white wolf does not have any dialog.Technical things to note:>Saving appears to work, but not the weather or time of day.>Loader gives more video modes than the game does.>Playing Windowed often allows your mouse to move outside of the game.>The camera still looks while in the menu.>There are no game tips in the game.>You cannot reach the main menu after the game has started.Concluding Notes:Looking closer at all of the preview screenshots (as of this review), there are only the 2 starting quests in the corner, which leads me to believe they are the only 2 included. The video has the wolf walking forwards. There is indeed no turning animation, however that isn't really an issue to complain about. The wolf model however does not pitch when moving up & down hills, but instead the legs stick into the ground.I think that if this author is serious about making a game where you play as a wolf, that's great! But at the -very- least the quest line needs to be closed (if that's all there is), remove hitboxes on bushes & add them to trees. If the player can move without glitches and know that the current quest is done, then there may be a cheap demo here (but not for 5.00+).>Also I did not attack the bear."

The save file somewhat ends up in your computers recycle bin?

Huge area,few wolf packs and very few loners.Fun things you discover( see in this game:* Police man trying to punch you in the face. Imagine that.

The most glaring problems of the previous version - fixed!However, it seems that my GPU still doesn't quite cut it.Jokes aside, the dev really did work on some of the bugs that I ran across in the tiny amount of time I actually played this game in.I do have a few improvement ideas:- Add an explanation for the most important controls as a quick cheat sheet (mapped to TAB or something similar).- Try improving the performance in any way- Put the text in front of a text box or add windows for them. Also, pause the game when the user is supposed to read a message- Improve the translation, even though this is low priority at this stage in developmentAll in all: Don't buy it at full price, what I see right now justifies buying on sale though.Don't expect a very playable experience, but the developer seems to be updating this game and making an effort in order to improve the product he is offering. I can barely give this a recommendation, but I can now recommend it - which is why I deleted my previous review which wasn't a recommendation."

I hunted, ate, and drank, fell of the grass and started over again. Got killed by the black wolf pack. Died due to thirst.I think the map lacks ponds and rivers the wolf can drink water from. Or just give the wolf some ability to like sense where to go to find water.Male wolf should have the ability to pee (mark) places and have some indicator so we can go back to our ""peed"" spot any time without getting lost.So hard to avoid getting lost.

76561198070684007,Recommended,485420,34867785,Posted: 10 September,all,Kodiak,"Right in the beginning I want to say that it is a shame how all the gamers these days are spoiled and rude haters. The first second a game hasn't high end graphics and physics it's called bad and other not quite right things. To be fair everyone who starts with something won't be perfect at all. And considerign that this is the first game the developers made AND that it is from what I've read still in early acces I will give my review on this.Now a question to everyone out there: How many RTS have you seen? How many shooters? How many survivals and rough likes and point n clicks and turn based and beat em up and card games and simulators and survivals? It's everything turning out to be the same. No matter which game Ubisoft or EA or Valve or TT develops it is always the same thing of a huge grey thing. There is nothing new outthere nothing exiting always the heroes of a edgy squad or the knight with his so ""epic"" armour.. nothing which hasn't been out there already. But now try to search for something like a game where you can play anything natural like a wolf. I have only seen a few games out there and still they are all so humble and infamous that I really start scratching my head if people go offensive at a game like that only because it's not a battle field 10 or a Call of duty 68 or a RTS with a lot of tanks and rocketlaunchers. Now I gotta say I have palyed the game for a few miutes and I have seen.. yeah it is laggy and yeah it has some problems but HEY the team who did this is not a 6 Mio. $ heavy puplisher company. It's a group in their first project doing their first steps in their history of making games.I like the game for being a NEW idea. There aren't yet new features or gameplay mechanics (I hope that there will be more mechanics to explore) but the setting is finnally something else than a squad of oh-look-at-me-how-badass-I-am-with-my-sniper-rifle. No it is a wolf which you can train and evolve. There's a pack to build and terretories to conquer. For me it feels like a whole new sort of game and I really enjoy to play it and look forward to explore it more.I would suggest to really take some updates in the movement and physical behaviours and the animations should be overhauled but still for me it is playable and I can understand that a new group in the game buisness is not yet skillfull enough to bring everything into a game which any big company could do. So even the missing phyics are forgiveable.As some words to the developers I wish you just the best with the game and maybe you will be able to make something big out of it. Every journy no matter how big starts with one step, and many will follow. Don't let yourself be discouraged by unsettisfyable gamers: Even the best will not be good enough for them! Kepp going and grow your team and skills so this game will grow as well. Maybe you will find people to help you making the game big? With new models and graphics and suggestions. Because we need new ideas and people who aren't afraid to develop things that are NEW.Thumbs up for the courage of creating things which never have been there before and to be different to other games.And now I gotta play some more to grow my pack and level my wolf.CheersYour Kodiak"
