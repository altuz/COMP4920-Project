When Im hidden in a box, the police/guards still notice me, as well as the lasers, sometimesit works, but sometimes it doesn't.-Other GlitchesEx. -Tabbing in and out sometimes glitches the game so I cannot move-Moving into some objects causes the ninja to get stuck, leading to me not being able to move-Gets very boring-Getting caught by cameras when I am not near them (even when it zooms in, you can see agiant gap between me, and the view of the camera or guard (happens with guards too).-PriceI feel like this game could be put onAddictingGames.comand played for free. This game doesnt't meet the price is WAY OVER what it is actually worth. Although I know making games is very difficult, there are many games that are free and better than this.I would not reccommend this game ESPECIALLY at 5 dollars, luckily I got it for 51 cents, but even then I am upset with my purchase due to how boring I feel when I play it (my opinion so don't get triggered by it). I would like Game developers to start creating more and better games for PC, rather than this, which gives me the ""Mobile Game"" feeling. A PC is an amazing platform and I want the games for PC to be better than the ones for consoles or mobiles or any other platforms (because our hardware can handle it).Do not purchase this, unless you want to play a Mobile type game on your BEAST PC"

This game doesn't even have anything to do with being a ninja. You are a hideously distorted Tinky Winky looking mass of ****.So Tinky Winky's objective is to infiltrate 'Doctor von has too much money's' ""lair"". And steal a ""compound"" (that has no further description on what or why) to save the world for further undisclosed reasons. So Tinky Winky puts down his tubby custard and gets to work.Now the ordinary part of the game is frustrating enough. You handle like a truck (well Tinky Winky is a fat **** so what can you expect?) and the hit markers for the detections are completely broken. Half the time blocking cameras with boxes doesn't work and you can never tell if it will or not due to the light still shining through the stupid things. The guards all seem to have single digit IQs as they don't seem the least bit disturbed that tons of boxes keep shifting positions around the room. Because that's obviously normal.The sound is annoying at best, with one particular sound effect (and mechanic) being a complete rip off of Metal gear solid. And when I was doing the Halloween bonus levels, good GOD. I had to turn the sound off. It was so irritating I wanted to punch something.Oh and let's briefly talk about the bonus levels and the halloween extras. Don't bother with them. The ramp up in difficulty is absurd. It IS doable, as I (somehow) did it without leaving a fist sized hole in my screen. But it's tedious and rage inducing.!!!Minor spoiler below but who really gives a ****!!!Yeah so when you successfully manage to navigate Tinky Winky through this ****show, you end up in front of some weird out of place computer looking system where for some reason blindly molesting it not only gives you the compound (somehow) but also triggers the self destruct...somehow.  So you get 15 seconds to walk about 2 metres into a sewer grate to escape. Now considering you came in initially through a sewer grate...WHY NOT GO UP THIS ONE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SKIP ALL THE BULL**** DETECTION ROOMS YOU STUPID TELLYTUBBY!?!?!So in the end Tinky Winky can either skip off merrily home or can be forcefully shoved towards the extra levels. Whilst you personally (whateveter your ending decision is) decide to slit your throat."

,Recommended,485450,33933500,Posted: 31 July,all,Your Cheeky Uncle,This game is kinda fun however not the most amazing game in the world but for 0.79p ($1) not bad. The game constantly showers you with achievement which is by no means bad however it alittle bit over the top. The only thing which i could fault the game for it somtimes I find the hit boxes are mildly off and there is a lack of controller surrport. But as both of these points are basically not picking I will recommend this game.
,Recommended,485450,34688283,Posted: 2 September,all,TheSlimeLord,"Honestly a really good game. It may not have the best graphics but the gameplay makes up for it. It's definitely worth the low price of the game. The game is around 3-4 hours for 100% completion. Some parts of the game are VERY rage inducing but other than that, its a pretty casual game. I recommend this game for sure."

It's mostly based off of good timing and good reactions but it's still challenging nonetheless.

76561198045824156,Not Recommended,485450,25290718,"Posted: 1 September, 2016",all,Senshu XD,"Absolutely awful hit detection in this game. I can't even begin to describe my frustration getting detected by random things such as the guard's flashlights or the beams when they aren't even touching my character! If even one tiny pixel of your character gets detected (even the swords on your back) you're dead. Most of the boxes also refuse to let you hide in them, only certain ones will, which makes absolutely no sense, maybe it's a bug, but who knows, the game is buggy overall and still needs a lot of work but still has some potential to be great. Save your money for now until It's finished."

,Recommended,485450,32226913,Posted: 6 June,all,Bob Spigot,"It just scrapes by with a recommend, though I did get the game and its DLC for around 50 pence.Its short, even with faffing around and a broken mechanic its easily finished in 2.5 hours, but for the most part its fine to play as you scoot around the various obstacles to unlock doors and proceed. Contrary to some reviews I saw no issue with collision detection, it seemed pixel perfect from beginning to end, and though I thought I was coming close none of the levels trapped me in such a way that Itd be impossible to complete them. Menus are a bit odd, but had all the basic options Id expect, and music varies in tone somewhat but is pretty good.Perhaps the biggest issue is that the box mechanic is essentially broken. Getting in to a box is bafflingly difficult, I found no real pattern to when it would or wouldnt allow me to do it and after butting at the box and hammering the key over and over eventually hed pop in (and annoyingly half the time pop immediately back out from my hammering of the key.)Whats probably more mystifying is that I dont think you actually need to get in the box once in the entire game... I used it two or three times so I cant be sure, but given it was usually a liability to even try, I tended to just block a laser with the box itself and get on with things, and it seemed that this worked in just about every case.Either this needs fixing or it should be cut from the game entirely. Instead it just tantilises you with a slightly easier route through, as long as butting around the box trying to get in to it doesnt end up getting you caught. (and it usually does.)"

,Recommended,485450,24100061,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Kunovega,"This is a pretty simple puzzle game that might be worth $1 some day.It's marred by some bugs though.1) Sound keeps forgetting what I have it set to. It randomly jumps from the volume I have it set at to blasting out my ear drums (with headphones on)2) to-hit boxes are not lined up well. the entire game relies on you moving with precision to avoid obstacles. What makes it hard is that the obstacles hit box is larger than the graphic so I find myself getting revealed by things that aren't actually touching me (the game pauses to show you your failure for a second ~ it's annoying to see that you failed and the thing that supposedly touched you isn't even touching you)This is a game I wish I could mark as neutral rather than thumbs up or down, at least in its current state.Thing is, it's also early access. So I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and push my neutral to a thumbs up rather than down because hopefully the developers will continue tweaking this before calling it a final release.Anyway. Not much point in giving a deep review on this. Look at the screenshots and video. That is the game in a nutshell. You are a ninja and you avoid being detected. But don't expect to be fighting or doing anything other than avoid detection. This is a puzzle game and your character could be a ball avoiding circles and cones and it would play the same as you being a ninja avoiding cameras and what not.So, bottom line I got this for 50% off with a coupon from making a badge. It's a neat little puzzle game for $1 or less and hopefully the devs will polish it a bit further while its still in early access."

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

I decided to give it another try, and I can't say that I'm not pleased with the changes. The gameplay feels more smooth and while the precision of the hitboxes didn't change, it feels more manageable. Instead of having to be perfect, you have to be careful."
,Recommended,485450,31161355,Posted: 15 April,all,aeko,"I bought this game on sale last weekend for about 39 or 49 cents, I'm not very sure to be fair. I just want to make it clear that it was a ""cheap pack"". I got the chance to try it out today and I must say it is a very nice game with about 25 levels plus some extra levels and a Halloween scene on the side which I also completed. It begins as easy, in my opinion. You can learn very quickly the mechanics on the game which are simple and effective. However, once you reach about level 18 or so, it begins to get a tad bit more complicated and you might have to give it more than one try to pass on to the next level. The soundtrack for me is quite nice as well, no complains. The only negative aspect I found, which some may disagree, is that the sensors are ""too tuned"". So, what I'm trying to say, is that in my opinion, sometimes when you are not supposed to get caught by a camera or by a laser, you will be. But I can live with that.Also: there's a second episode which unfortunately I could not play and later I figured out that I had to buy some sort of expansion in order to play it. It was not of my understandings when I first bought the game and I was a little bit disappointed by that fact, I'm still considering on buying it if it goes on a good sale.All in all, I give this game 8/10 taking in consideration the following aspects:-Challenge-Price-Achievements-Steam trade cards-FunI recommend it to everyone who is trying to relax and play a nice little game for a couple hours in order to complete it, paying just a small amount in order to do so."
,Recommended,485450,23462541,"Posted: 8 June, 2016",all,NME Plays,"I initially had less than favorable things to say about the game with the early access version, however, going back and taking a look at all the improvements the developer has made, I have changed my opinion.Most, if not all, of the complaints I had about the original have been addressed and either removed or fixed.  The game operates much more fairly and smoothly now.  Checkpoints are there to keep you from repeating the same tedious obstacles too many times.  Guards act the way you'd expect guards to act.  You can MGS your way through some stuff hiding in a box even.My only real complaints now are really personal preference things.  It's odd that some boxes move, and some don't.  There are 3 different types of boxes, but that doesn't tell you if they're movable or not.  Just, how easily they may move if they do.  It feels strange, but it's minor.  I also pushed a box I should have been able to enter through a wall, which made it impossible to get a bonus computer.  Again, it's a minor bug, but it may result in level breaking consequences.I said before that this game has a lot of potential to be a lot more fun than it is, and the developer proved beyond a shadow of a doubt they are willing to put the effort in to make it just that.  This is an excellent update on what was delivered in Early Access and I'm very happy to do a 180 on my feelings for the game.  The price tag asked on this game is absolutely fair, and I'm really excited to see more from this developer."
