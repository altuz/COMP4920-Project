,Not Recommended,485490,23699064,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,Imban,"Meh... not much to say about this. It's a fairly simple RPG in which you uncover tiles which have loot, potions, spells, monsters, or nothing behind them. Loot you pick up, potions you pick up if you need them or at the end of the stage, spells you cast if you need to (so, basically never in my experience), and monsters you have to fight.The combat system is based on timing, insofar as you have to press the spacebar when the enemy swings at you in order to reduce damage, and then click on the enemy immediately after to do a critical hit for massive damage. By the middle of the game I had nearly 100% damage reduction on a successful block, and at the end of the game I had a full 100%, so ""block correctly and then attack again right away for massive damage"" was the entirety of the strategy in the game, with me almost never using spells found on the ground and rarely using my character skills - only against the few types of enemies where I wasn't very good at timing their attacks. If you're better than me at it, even that wouldn't be necessary.It still wasn't all that easy, because failing to block an attack could easily cost half of my life instantly, and the checkpoint system made the final dungeon occasionally frustrating, in that there's a checkpoint every five levels... but if you die and respawn at the checkpoint, you need to reach the next checkpoint before dying or be sent back to the start of the dungeon. This isn't so bad until you consider that each dungeon is five floors longer than the last, culminating in a 50-floor dungeon.Furthermore, the mechanics for your stats are... weird. You first find dropped items that barely do much, and gems you can socket in your items that give small bonuses that are still the equivalent of the entire item's bonuses due to how little the items do. Then you unlock the merchant, who sells items... except they still don't do much, and its catalog expanding throughout the game basically means you'll never be able to afford them. And then you unlock the mystic and the ability to fuse gems, and suddenly your items still don't do much, but have gems in them that give gigantic stat bonuses, bigger than both the base items and your levelups. And then, near the end of the game, you unlock the blacksmith and the ability to upgrade items, and suddenly your items also give huge bonuses... two maps or so before the end of the game.Anyway, ultimately... well, it's a $2 game. It not having much depth - not even an ending or anything once I beat the final boss - is to be expected to some degree, but I also felt it didn't have much of a point, either, and it was more tedious than fun. It's definitely not going to show up on any ""worst game of 2016""-style lists, but I don't think it's worth your time to play."

Dungeon Journey is a cousin of Rune Stone Keeper and Dungelot and that's a very goodthing. Unlike the previous games however some reflexes are required. When a monster attacks you need to hit the space bar at the right time to minimize damage.The game clearly looks like it is made for phones. I don't mind what the platform is as long as the game play is fun. The graphics are quite nice and the game has a fun sense of humor. There are two endless dungeon areas that will be unlocked on your journey. You are faced with some interesting choices as you delve deeper. Not sure what that spell does? Right click it and you get the skinny on it. Your character levels up but remember that this is a roguelike so don't get too attached.It's no epic journey like Legend of Grimrock or the classic Dungeon Keeper. Rather, it's a fun game to fire up when you just want some simple fun."

The gameplay with clicking on enemies to take down their health and clicking the protagonist or using spacebar to block enemy attacks, with clear visual representation of attacks to help with timing. All in all its enjoyable for what it is, but would be far more suited for its original platform and it is debatable if this is a worthwile title for a PC gaming collection"

But while playing on PC it feels like a chore, all you do is click to uncover a dungeon. That is the entire game, and while there is nothing wrong with that at least make it semi-interesting. It fails in being interesting and not at all being fun. If you're looking for a good casual Dungeon Crawler with RPG elements then I would stay away from this. This game is simply a mobile game put on Steam, and if you're OK with that and just want some mindless clicking for about 30 minutes. Then pick this up, if you look for a bit more in your games, stay away from this."

By far the best $0.49 I ever spent on steam. If you like stat crunching, loot and decent challenge I think you will have lots of fun. Surprisingly enough it has a good amount of depth and variety.For $0.49-2.00 you really can't go wrong with it but if you must have more detail please read below .GameplayYou can learn basic mechanics in about 2 minutes but there is a lot of decision making beyond that. The best way to describe the gameplay is -Risk vs Reward+Lots of Grinding. You constantly choosing between exploration and saving your health. However, grinding is a big part of this game. You may find that yourself stuck in the same dungeon for a long time until you can level up enough. Make sure you go to your inventory and right click on items to put gems inside. I have 3 unlocked playable characters but it looks like there are 5 in total. Each has 2 unique abilities and 2 passive abilities which you can level up.If you die you loose nothing except dungeon progress. Eventually, you should have no problem beating it .There is Endless mode so if you get maxed out you can certainly go for personal goals. Loot and Crafting system is pretty fair. You can upgrade items and craft smaller gems into bigger gems to increase bonuses ( very similar to the way Diablo 2-3 did it )Feedback on game mechanics (Tips)Technically combat is turn-based. That means if you hit the enemy they will hit you once too. So you should not click a lot because block animation won't be able to keep up .How to use shield properly? You will see enemies ""shoot lasers"" toward you and you may notice that block is not working. Well you actually have to block the animation that comes after that. When laser touches you you will see claw marks,axes,bites etc. (that is what you have to block) There are a lot of unique enemies in the game and most require different block timing. There are some that shoot projectiles that you have to block right away . Blocking also will probably not reduce damage completely.How to do counter attack ? You just have to block at the perfect time. You will see enemy icon turn gold . Hit them to get one free hit that may trigger unique abilities.PresentationDecent music and sound effects . Good monster variety .  I like animation style even if 3D models look a bit unfinished. Several playable characters. Map with progression and endless option. Overall pretty well put together game and I do not have much to complain about. Personally I find the aesthetics enjoyable but the game settings are barebones if that matters.Verdict 7/10. Very good value if you like grinding loot and stats. Perhaps some people may find it repetitive but I actually think there is enough variety. Always a pleasure to find a game that is more enjoyable than some AAA games . I was pleasantly surprised to get a decent game for $0.49, lets leave it at that ."

That said, it does work as a PC game—if your screen is very small, or you're willing to do some registry fiddling to change the resolution of the game window. (For information on how to do this, lookhere.)The game itself is a simple, casual roguelike. It's enjoyable and engaging enough to be worthwhile, although hardly unique or very memorable. Strategy-wise, there is some (if not very much) depth here, and although the practical use of some elements (such as Perception) don't become apparent until you've sunk quite a few points into them, most of the gameplay is fairly intuitive and presents itself well.There is a hitch, however. The entire point of a casual game is to be noncommittal and not require total focus, but one of the core elements of Dungeon Journey (the shield block) is reaction-based, and thus repeatedly forces the player to concentrate entirely on playing rather than treating the game as the casual distraction it is clearly intended to be. This is unlikely to be an issue for everyone, but it can get highly frustrating for some of us.The audio side is passable. The UI and game sounds are pretty professional. The music does sometimes get rather annoying (mostly, I think, because it's badly compressed) but then it's a casual game. For my part, I simply turned all sound off once I realised that none of it gives any gameplay advantage.Dungeon Journey is not a bad little game, and for the low price, it is easy to forgive the lack of polish (poor English, incomplete tutorial, subpar graphics, and so on.) If you're looking for a hardcore, involving and comprehensively strategic roguelike, look elsewhere—but if like me you're simply looking for something to mess around with when your concentration isn't strictly needed elsewhere, then Dungeon Journey might well be the ticket."

It's very easy to get into to the gameplay, yet does it demand a combination of risk management, strategic thinking and quicktime reaction to actually survive whatever the game throws at you.

You pick a class (starting as a mage) and can switch between classes as you unlock them. You enter dungeons which are grid based. You descend down them floor by floor until you reach the bottom. At the bottom there is a boss that you must defeat to complete the dungeon.Don't worry if you keep dying, as each death lets you retry the dungeon which makes you stronger. Once you character is strong enough you should be able to complete the dungeons no problem.The dungeon is randomly generated every time so that you aren't grinding away at the same dungeon every time and the game includes endless dungeons for replayability (great inclusion in my oppinion)Music fits well with the games art style and gameplay. Only downside I've seen so far is some strange UI decisions and inability to use or equip items you have found on your current run. This is a great game for the price. It looks like it can be enjoyed on newer systems and older ones as well (maybe even netbooks!).

The player assuming control of one of several typical characters (mage, knight, hunter and so on), is sent to investigate one of the dungeons in search of treasure, artifacts and bonuses. The gameplay is alternately open squares — sectors dungeons, each of which may be hiding the treasure, a trap or enemy. When meeting with the enemy, a lot depends on your reaction and speed with the mouse, since all battles occur in real time, and in fact are zaklikivanie enemy attacks or abilities of the hero. The enemy also attacks, and only the timely press of the block (spacebar) saves him from most of the damage. After the death of the hero loses all accumulated in the dungeon artifacts and returns to the main map, and the dungeon will be reset, which leads to the need to re-open the map floors. The same hero can be ""pumped"", raising its characteristics, dressing and arming, learning skills and spells and improving equipment special stones..So the game is easy, quite fun and simple in concept a hybrid of several genres, among which are role-playing slasher, and explore the dungeons and clicker.

Игрок, взяв на себя управление одним из нескольких типичных героев (маг, рыцарь, охотник и так далее), отправляется исследовать одно из подземелий в поисках сокровищ, артефактов и сильных противников. Игровой процесс представляет из себя поочередное открывание квадратов — секторов подземелья, за каждым из которых может скрываться сокровище, ловушка или противник. При встрече с противником многое зависит от вашей реакции и скорости работы с мышкой, так как все бои происходят в реальном времени и по сути представляют из себя закликивание противника ударами или способностями героя. Противник тоже атакует, и только своевременное нажатие блока (клавиша пробел) спасает героя от большей части повреждений. После смерти герой теряет все накопленные в подземелье артефакты и возвращается на главную карту, а подземелье «обнуляется», что приводит к необходимости заново открывать карту этажей. Так же героя можно «прокачивать», поднимая его характеристики, одевая и вооружая, изучая умения и заклинания и улучшая экипировку специальными камнями..Таким образом игра представляет из себя легкую, вполне увлекательную и простую по концепции помесь нескольких жанров, среди которых есть и ролевой слэшер, и исследование подземелий и кликер. Не смотря на свои явные «мобильные» корни она вполне хорошо смотрится и играется на компьютере."
