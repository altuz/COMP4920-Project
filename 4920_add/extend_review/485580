,Not Recommended,485580,25506799,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,Intelligence,"Watched the trailer? Yes? You've pretty much experienced the entire game.Kind of ironic it's named 24 HOURS when it can quite literally be 100% completed within 24 seconds. That's no exaggeration.Add the fact that there's only 1 sound in the entire game being the overly loud single fire from the 1 weapon you've got. Also, there's no sound options, in fact there's no options at all, there's ""Option"" which leads to a selection for Shadow/Texture detail, changing it makes absolutely no difference.There is also a nice description of which keys do what on the main menu, G to Save Game, K to Load Game and R being Pause for some bizarre reason but hey, there's no reload in this game or a use for one, just pause every time you even think about reloading.I still don't understand why he chose to show off the trailer at such low FPS, I mean the game runs fine over here, why is he running his own game on a toaster to showcase it? Oh and every screenshot, all from the first and only level, there's literally 3-4 steps taken between each screenshot.The whole thing doesn't make sense at all, it's just shoot some floating skulls, walk to the end of a corridor, turn around and enjoy the silent small world you're constrained to. What purpose does this game serve? It's not even laughably funny bad, which I tend to enjoy to some extent. It's just ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.I'm being as honest and kind as I can be with this but it's quite simply just a lazy cash grab. Buy something else, it's actually hard to debate whether this game or Watch Paint Dry has more content. It's that bad. While I believe my review may or may not be deleted by the developer, I'm keeping a copy of it to re-post at a later date just in case that happens."

A first-person horror game to truly rival the legendary Devils Share!Some reviews are claiming this game takes only thirty seconds to play, but I appear to have lucked out and received the ""Director's Cut"" edition...which, unless I'm mistaken, lasts a small handful of minutes before I quite literally cycle all the way back to where I started, again and again and again! Outdoor area...tunnel area...outdoor area...oh, here we are, in the EXACT SAME TUNNEL AREA AGAIN!All of this, with but two types of enemies, only one of which can be seen more than two feet ahead in the almost-total darkness which I'm quite, quite sure was a carefully-crafted aesthetic decision on the dev's behalf. And only one sound, being that of your noisy and frankly irritating firearm.Between the otherwise all-encompassing vacuum of sound, and the cyclical nature of the gameplay, I can only assume the dev was going for a ""recurring nightmare"" motif. And, I have to admit, he or she has thoroughly succeeded on that account. 24 Hours IS a nightmare. From which you can perhaps only escape by hitting the ""Quit Game"" option.Actually, the more I think about it, I think I actually PREFERRED Devils Share, on account that it persistently (and mercifully) crashed on me during the first thirty seconds of gameplay.

,Not Recommended,485580,29225898,Posted: 13 January,all,¡★Zerafalgar,"I really want to make a complex review of this game, I really do. But I am literally not able to.All I am able to tell about the game is that it was probably translated to english using Google translator. I don't understand how one could spell ""back"" as ""bake""  in the in-game options. You've probably noticed a lot of spelling mistakes in the Steam store page of the game itself already, too.Graphics feel almost indifferent, no matter whether you play on low, or ""ultra"", they are terrible either way.It might be something with my old, low-tier laptop, but although the game is so simple and has so low graphics, it always crashes like 5 minutes after I launch it, that's the reason I cannot review the gameplay that much. (note the game eats a lot of performance considering how simple it is. I can run much more demanding games such as DOOM, ARK or Overwatch without having them crash)Any playtime I'll spend on this game since the time of writing this review will only be to get the trading cards, praying that the game won't crash.If you really want the game, get it on a big discount. I got it at around 0.16€ while it was discounted if I recall correctly, worth the trading cards. If the game is not on discount, there are better game you can get for 0.99€ instead.I don't hate on the game at all, it sure seems to have some potential, but it's so simple, yet has horrible performance. It has a level of a free indie game.From what I've seen in the game, I couldn't really find anything I could rate positively.I wish you good luck with making games in the future, if you plan to, devs. While I don't think this game had been a success, there still is a potential making me believe I could see much greater games from you in a few years."

I understand, that this game is just one dollar, but this game felt like a free Miniclip halloween game, or a school project. Howewer the shooting mechanism was actually quite nice. I liked how the bullets didn't just fly straight. You could snipe the burning skulls from a distance. But there was no aiming or anything in the middle of your screen to know where you're shooting. The game had just one sound effect and it was the ear♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥loud boom you can hear in the trailer. The game was so dark, you couldn't really see anything except a little area covered by your flaslight. The skulls actually got me scared when they appeared on the screen. There were two types of skulls: The burning ones and black ones. The burning skulls I was able to see from a distance, but I had no idea where the black ones were. You just had to shoot randomly to kill them. There was just one map, that I was able to complete with a few tries. It took me about 20 minutes. The game was laggy and the menu screen was terrible. I would not recommend anyone to play this. I just did it for the cards. And I guess this game is called '24 HOURS' because it was made in 24 hours."

,Not Recommended,485580,30849139,Posted: 31 March,all,Station Earth,"I don't know where to start with this game. It's a game I had very mild amusement with but not the kind of amusement you would pay money for. Kind of like overhearing an interesting conversation between two people and getting a giggle out of it. Amusing, but not worth money.24 HOURS is a game that is nothing remotely near what it's description (which might I add has some grammatical errors) states. I doubt the developer has any knowledge whatsoever on what ""intrepid"" even means as well as using the word ""precipitate"" very awkwardly and most likely in the wrong context. As well as stating that you'll be saving people (which there is none) from evil powers (which are big floating skulls). I guess that's evil...? Not very creative but huh... skulls (some are fiery but are no different from the pitch black ones you can barely pick out cause the entire map is about 90% pitch black).But nevermind that. The name of the title has no relevance at all to the game. Maybe it was the amount of time the developer took to determine whether or not it was morally right to submit this game to the steam store. Ironically, it takes about 1/12 of that time to actually beat the game. There is no storyline whatsoever (unless you count the game's description on steam the storyline which even the game fails to folllow). There is also no audio whatsoever aside from the one that your gun spits out everytime you fire it.You can tell just from the screenshots that little to no effort was put into this game (if you can even call it that). There are no in depth options in the main menu such as video, gameplay, control bindings, or anything else. Although you don't really need them as the game is just run and shoot. And when you die? The game freezes for a second and you're back at the start. There isn't even a death animation or game over screen.Whoever worked on this did not work on this, and for 2.19 CAD dollars, is theft. Spend it elsewhere.TL;DR: The game has 1 sound file, 20 colours, and is about 20 minutes long,  I spent the other hour and 40 minutes exploring the entire game's map (it is that small and no, there is nothing). There is as much content in this game as there is chips inLaysbags. $2.19 CAD, would you?"

,Not Recommended,485580,28480120,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,KDD!^agof,"I completed this game so you don't have to.It's a baby's first fps level (only one), about a luminescent (well abnormally luminescent, compared to a human) MARINE (that's what is said in marketing materials) (oh, and he is intrepid) with one semi-automatic gun, shooting with extreme ark, at three types of hovering skull enemies, two of which are black (and therefore are invisible outside of MARINE's bioluminescent glow, to create EXTREMELY cheap jump-scares) and one is so hyped that it's already ON FIRE. I could count textures on fingers, but i'm too lazy for that. Outside of a (probably) template gun, (probably) template trees and (probably) template skulls everything else is extremely low-poly and basic. Level-design consists of a wide ""graveyard"" area going into grey-brick tunnel (with a grey brick floor and a grey brick ceiling) with a couple of turns, opening into semi-wide area leading to ""urban-city courtyards"" where you can find a glowing green sphere and end your 24 minute (TWENTY FOUR MINUTE) or less misery and being thrown up back into the ""menu"". The best parts are invisible walls and tiny entrances to the next parts of the level, which you can't see in low light and have to stumble upon.Hey, but at least you can jump here, unlike in walking simulators.If you want to experience this for yourself — F5 turns on debug mode and F1 turns it off.Unreal engine works just fine @ UHD UWS Surround out of the box, but low-poly and incredible texture work are so intense that game barely works at 20 fps on GF970SLI. It doesn't have any graphical options and have motion blur turned on by default.Trading cards look slightly less awful than a game, but if you click them to see wallpaper — they just stretch to the size without any consideration to aspect ratio. First 4 badges are somewhat tolerable, but 5th and foil are absolutely disgusting. Emoticons are just red smileys with fake photoshop volumetric effect, which makes them incredibly ugly to use on steam. Two out of three would profile background would be absolutely cheap but tolerable, if not for extreme blurriness and low resolution.Here, i spent more time writing this review, than the developer spent it on making this game. Knowing that this is just steam-trading-cards-flick they at least could use basic photoshop skills to have better steam trading meta fluff (like emoticons and profile backgrounds)."
