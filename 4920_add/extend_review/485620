,Recommended,485620,23494157,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,stuart.thiel,"This is... surprisingly not bad. There's some UI work that needs cleaning up for feel, but it's really quite reasonable. I wanted the steam cards (which, problematically, have not been appearing in my inventory, but steam community seems borked so I'll give it a day), but tried it out a bit. In terms of play, I found it more enjoyable than hearthstone.There are a lot of game play decisions that I'd suggest to make it more the way I want, but that's just because I want something a little different. Objectively, what was produced in terms of gameplay is surprisingly good.The interface is where I'd actually expect the developers to focus. You need a card-o-pedia to detail game rules, cards and possibly context. The mechanism for identifying remaining mana can seem opaque with multiple numbers, minuses and the mana potions. The help-mode is super irritating because it blocks view, but not event propogation till you remember to dismiss it... tool-top equivalent on-hover would be preferred, but I get that you have a lot of quite clear info to convey, so maybe a question mark ""help"" icon in the upper right of each card that pulled up that help interface for the specifica card, and clicking anywhere would dismiss that. The AI for single-player is pathetic (but no more so than any other card-playing AI I've come across in recent history).But for all that, you should probably consider buying this even if you don't care about the steam trading cards. Sure, it'd be nice if the graphics were slicked up too, but who cares? The games a solid 9/10 for quality of play, though you're gonna be sad if you can't find friends to play it against."

There is also an in-game card browser for you to learn about each card, and you can mark the cards individually as underpowered or overpowered, which will presumably give feedback to the developer to balance the cards.The design and variety of the cards, however, are rather mediocre, but the developer seems to be committed to improve the game. There is no deck-building. You start off with 1 hero (either human, undead, elf, or orc), each comes with its own minion cards. Each turn begins by picking a number of minion cards, scroll cards, and mana points. The minion cards are mostly played to attack the enemy minion cards or enemy hero, although some are played defensively. Scroll cards are cards that have a variety of effects either on self or the enemy, eg. ""+ATK"" or ""damage enemy"". Playing both types of cards require mana points. Win the game by killing the enemy hero. Good mix of strategy to plan which cards to play and luck getting good cards to win the game.It's usually hard to find any game online at all due to the small player base. Thankfully there's a hotseat mode where you can play with your friend by sharing the same PC, or if your friend own this game, just invite him / her for a match.Pros:+easy to learn+quick game sessions (typical game lasts 10 minutes)+cheap+multiplayer with friends (hotseat or invite game)+musicCons:-limited design and variety of cards-balance issue of cards (some boring and useless)-limited online player base"

I like card games but have an issue with Pay to Win models that let certain players buy up tons of cards and win. This game prevents that and allows all the players to draw from the same pool. I like that, the game may be a bit on the cheaper side with only like 200 unique cards however if you ever looking for something cheap and easy. Pick it up for the $1."

Unlike other card games you don't have to invest a lot of time or money to have a competitive deck. I also can sit down for five minutes and have a quick match or binge play all night. I will admit finding a human to play against has been a bit rough, but the game is new. Finding competition will become easier as more and more people start playing. Over all, the price is right, the game is fun, you should try it....now...do it now."

Pay once and everything is unlocked and ready to go. The game itself is fun so far and easy to get into. You can't build your own decks, but I don't feel like that's a huge deal in this particular game. It has a nice balance between random chance and strategy/skill, too. I haven't felt like I've been cheated or screwed over by bad draws yet, and every loss I've suffered has felt fair. The online matchmaking works well, if you're into that. It will probably flourish with more players.All in all, I found very little to complain about and a lot to enjoy. I'll probably log a decent amount of hours into this gem. For the price to enjoyment ratio, it's the best deal I've gotten in a long time!"
76561197993053075,Recommended,485620,23512666,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,schweiza,"Good:1. Love the mana system, compared to other tabletop card games such as MTG. There is a constant supply of mana and it is up to the player to decide if it is worth gathering. In other words, you can forgo drawing a card (you can draw two per turn) in exchange for adding one point of mana to your pool, permanently.2. The cards appear to be well balanced and, for the most part, fun and interesting with multiple uses.3. Game is short and sweet with just enough decision making to make it engaging. I love the fast-paced games. Most of my games last about 5 minutes.4. The game has a built-in ratings system for player feedback. You can let the creators know if a card is over or under powered as well as if it is boring. I love the forsight put in by the developer.5. Art work is good and fits with the style of the game. Sound effects are also complimentary.6. The heros you have to choose from, while not numerous, have a distinct abilities that, I feel, change the game significantly. Players can level up (if you draw the card for it), further powering their starting  abilities (do more damange, spawn more powerful minions, etc.).The bad:1. Not a big enough user base. It is nearly impossible to find a match. Also, given the general lack of players, it is difficult to find a challenging partner.2. While some human opponents are challenging, the CPU is most definitely not. I have never lost to the computer in overr 30 games.Overall:Fun game, well worth the money. However, it is waaaay too easy playing the CPU. Also, given the lack of a user base, human players are typically not very challenging either.Good game, but not very challenging."

Practice/solo games will randomly reset (Edit: specifically when the random traits of a match are being determined, the match will often reset and cycle through more random traits for the match, then reset etc. eventually a match does ""stick"") and/or one is unable to take their normal turn as the timer is almost instantly run down (Edit: this seems to be the case at about the half-way point--when the timer accelerates). These issues make practice/solo games untenable when these glitches arise.I will continue to ""attempt"" to play the practice/solo mode and see if the above issue is corrected. If so the review will become positive--as the overall game has a classic feel to it which is refreshing, and contains enough depth/diversity to maintain interest.Edit 28/09/16I keep running into game breaking issues in terms of solo/practice play (as noted above and in the comments below). However, I keep running into them--which means I'm still playing the game. The dev, as noted in the comments to this review, also does seem quite attentive and that is refreshing. I am changing my review to positive on the basis that, while very unstable, the game has enough draw to play inspite of the match ending bugs. Likewise, an active dev is something that warrants some respect.I am optimistic that the solo-play issues will be fixed in the near future and thus am giving this a tentatively positive review."

It is very much like Hearthstone except that as you play the game you can draft random cards they give you into your hand. I find this concept very useful especially for newbies in the game so they are not overpowered by opponents with better decks. Unfortunately, it seems that this game doesnt get the attention it really deserves with the most recent review being a couple months old.

,Recommended,485620,25776548,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,The Jigsaw Man,Amatuer attempt at a card game but a very good attempt.Bare-boned with simple '7th Grade Math folder' illustrations the game stillruns competently and introduces a few new ideas (as far as I'm aware)such as timed cards which detonate and launch themselves at the opponent orcharacter cards that grant heal on all of your monster cards at the end of each battle.Defense is handled differently too where in cards must be placed in the front row but you can't just optfor that placement initially meaning other actions have to allow that opportunity or the card has a specifc instructionto be placed in the front line upon entry.There appears to be no deck-building or card-collecting. Despite having a card viewer with filters you're granted all cards from the start.There's no campaign (but these kinds of games really don't need a story) thus a strong focus on mulitplayeror skirmish against A.I. (which I found to be on the easy side).You can also play local Hotseat but who the hell still does that??The phenominally small $1 asking price is fair enough but if you're swamped in card/board games alreadyyou'll probably find this one laying in your backlog for awhile as it's a poor man's version of all of the others.

I have always been a fan of strategic cards games, but sometimes don't have enough time or resources to really build up a worthy selection of cards.  One of the great things about this game is that this is not a problem here; you have access to all cards at random from the beginning.Another great feature of this game (for me) is being able to use a controller.  I don't know why this appeals to me so much, but I love being able to play this game from the couch.I've heard people complain about the art, but I dig it; I think it has personality.A great game for quick, pick-me-up sessions, or extended gaming jams.  A dollar is an amazing asking price for this, and if you ever see it on sale, I would think you'd be mistaken if you didn't at least try it."

If I load it up late at night, I can't find anyone for multiplayer, but I have been able to play multiple multiplayer games.Menu/UI system (especially in game) are a bit clunky and awkward, but once you figure it all out, this is a great way to burn some time. I love how it's all random without deck building, so you can just jump in and see what crazy plays you can make, and then jump back out to whatever you were doing.I've only had  2 crashes. One was after I had alt tabbed a few times, so probably minor. The other was when I tried to use a card that moved an enemy's row on an enemy minion.Obviously this is not a super compeitive game and is meant to just be a short, fun time burner as everything is random. There will be games where your opponent gets a bunch of high powered creatures (say 6/6 or better) and you literally get nothing better than 1 atk/power, don't let it frustrate you and just try again, because the opposite will happen too."

I play mtg competitively for a number of years now but I've realized that despite my love for it, I only make about 5 *actual* decisions per match. Per 50 minute match. In PickAHero, despite the easy-to-get-into mechanics, I'm making just as many actual decisions per 8 minute game.Quick games means you'll get a lot of good feedback. Good feedback is opposed to bad feedback like ""I guess I lose because I didn't draw enough land."" Lots of good feedback will give you that bubbly excited feeling as you learn the depth the mechanics have to offer. It makes you want to play more. I think that feeling is called fun? I'm a robot.I'm recommending this game to all my friends. I need more people attacking this game's uncharted waters. I crave a deeper understanding of this game just as I did mtg and hearthstone.

Dream Quest's art is roughly this terrible, but I played at least a hundred hours of it, because its deck building roguelike gameplay was great. But Pick a Hero is just BAD. It's just a cheap clone of Hearthstone, or rather just the Discover mechanic. Real card drafting is fun - trying to pick the best cards from a random selection to add to your deck is tense, nerdy fun. (When's the digital version of Seven Wonders going to come out?!) But that's not what this is. Each turn you're presented with a selection of three cards to pick from to add to your hand. You have no idea what's coming next. It sounds really random because it is.The interface is also AWFUL, especially how you have to activate a special mode to see what the text on cards mean. There are also major glitches, such as the way that all the cards disappear from the gallery if you Alt-Tab away.Maybe buy this now if you want it as a conversation piece after Blizzard sues it off of Steam?"
