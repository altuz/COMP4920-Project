,Not Recommended,485690,24350056,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Atarun,"I really wanted to like this hidden object game, especially given how useful and pleasant the map system is (it prevents backtracking, which is for me the major flaw of the genre).But absolutely nothing makes sense.Among things that made all suspension of disbelief impossible for me:An armed sheriff decides not to go look for the missing girl (who was just abducted) with his deputies but instead ask Random_private_detective.Random_private_detective goes on the hunt for a dangerous psychopath and his victim armed with only her id card and her high heels (also, her attire isn't appropriate for the task, the location or even the weather). Oh, scratch that, she leaves the card in the car, so she only has her high heels.Random_private_detective has never heard of forensics, so she manipulates all the evidence without gloves. To her defense, seeing the behavior of police, I doubt this fictional world has a court system.The armed psychopath knows full well that Random_private_detective is trying to corner him and save his latest victim, but instead of running away or getting rid of the evidence, he sneaks around Random_private_detective for hours. During that complete waste of his time, I counted 4 miserable attempts (the falling tree, the well, the fire and the box) at Random_private_detective's life that he did not bother to follow through because... because. Meanwhile, Random_private_detective who does not seem to be a psychopath, has no hesitationgunning down the bad guy who has let her and Emily live.Random_private_detective seems to have enough foresight to guess which items will come in handy to open mysteriously sophisticated locks before seeing said locks, but she will again and again get rid of useful items like hammers for the pleasure of seeking new ones later on. Oh and she has never heard of brute force algorithms, so forget trying to crack a 3-digit code.The bad guy keeps closing doors right in front of Random_private_detective, but a second later, when she tries to open the door, she finds out its lock is broken and its parts are scattered around the property... How does that work? Why did he prepare so many locks and scatter their parts? Did he never lock anything before Random_private_detective arrived or is he continuously breaking and repairing his own locks for fun?Random_private_detective, despite her attire, is actually customer of the year at Home Depot. She spends so much time dismantling and building stuff, I bet her agency is called DIY Detective. She will however rarely break objects to get their content, because it makes much more sense to rummage through the area for hours for a key (or even create one with a mold) than cut or break open a bag, book or coffin. Especially considering thatthe victim is still alive and could have been killed any minute if logic existed in this world.Most mechanisms make as little sense as the characters. Most puzzles left me speechless because there seems to be absolutely no link between the solution and the opening of the container. Worst offender:the puppet show... I mean, why does it move on its own? how does it detect that you give the right items or not?? how come you get an eagle figure at the end??? HOW DOES ANY OF IT WORK?!Despite her considerable DIY expertise, Random_private_detective is no MacGyver. Not only can she never substitute a component with another (why on Earth would one need specific branches to fix a rope ladder?and need to cut them with a chainsaw? with a killer sneaking around and planks laying around everywhere), she sometimes has clearly suicidal tendencies... Worst offender:Would you go down into the well the killer just threw something in instead of using the hook to try to get the objects back up? Once stuck in the well, would you destroy its walls in the hopes that it would fill quickly enough for you to get out but not cave in on you?So, the story is complete nonsensical BS, the characters act like they have expired yoghurt instead of brain cells, most of the puzzles make no sense... but even the hidden object scenes are a bit flawed: item names are often used to mean different things from one scene to the next. A bow will be a bow tie in one scene and a violin bow in the next. A key will be a regular one in one scene and a monkey wrench in the next. And so on and so forth.Those flexible definitions would not be a problem per se, if there was not regularly multiple items fitting the same definition in a single scene... The game will often ask you to find a key or mask, present you with 2 or 3 of them and then you have to try them all to find which one the game arbitrarily decided is the right choice.All in all, I cannot recommend this game. It was clearly made by a motivated team who (mistakenly, imo) think they understand what hidden object games are all about, but it is a mess."
,Not Recommended,485690,28949314,Posted: 2 January,all,Faudraline,"I remember playingDance of Deathsome time ago - another HOG published by Alawar, yet ended up in the repertoire of RunServer for some reason or the other. That game left me with a bad taste in the mouth, so I wasn't expecting much of a miracle from this one either.Hope Lakepresents a somewhat similar experience with the small developer team Far Mills + MysteryTag, and with a more mystery, less supernatural undertone... ending up quite supernatural anyhow. Sure, it has a better environment mapping and far longer gameplay stored, but it is similarly halfway done. Now that I played the game, it is safe to declare that it is 2/2 miss for games hailing from RunServer catalog.We are a random lady detective - detective Kelly Wells, if you are awfully curious - invited to investigate the kidnapping of Emily Lynch, a young women recently disappeared near Hope Lake. Why we are to be sent out to the woods by the sheriff of the area, in the middle of the night, without arms or backup to track a kidnapper exceeds me, yet here we are. Apparently, there was an old boarding house run by a mean Mrs. Braun back in its day in the area, and our investigation conveniently leads us to the said boarding house. We are soon to discover the involvement of a well nurtured psychopath in this kidnapping, in an attempt to exact revenge for an old crime. Be warned, supernatural - even though not the richly depicted kind - is yet again the primary element of this half-baked story.Okay, again for the record, I actually love hidden object games. I'm all in for some mindless entertainment when it comes to sparing an afternoon to fetch some items and solve some basic puzzles with a story undertone. Yet, even I expect a certain quality set within the boundaries of the genre! The story is ridden with countless logic errors, undermining the skill and IQ level of both our detective, and the perpetrator. Every turn we take, we basically stumble upon the mystery perpetrator, and he manages to escape by a neck - 6 times or so - yet he still keeps running about without destroying the evidence, hiding the kidnapped girl or dealing with the detective properly. Oh, come on! It's a single woman with a .38 in an abandoned house in the middle of the woods, which you supposedly spent all your life in! What kind of a bad guy you are? This guy is a dozy, I tell you.The display is the better part of this game, with decent artwork and somewhat appreciable atmosphere. Voice acting is subpar - do not expect lip-synch or anything - and there is only one soundtrack piece running in the background again, and again, and again... Now, that gets annoying pretty easy. Illustrations are not various, but they are quite alright. One would prefer better cinematic pieces though, considering the tone and the atmosphere.Gameplay is nothing extraordinary. It is your millionth HOG, with wrongly labelled items on awfully shady environments at every scene. Every single HOG scene that I encountered included a wrongly labelled item or two, so after a while, I started clicking on random items until the scene is done, considering there is no misclick penalty either. Puzzles? They are all really easily and some are only time consuming. Nothing creative or even remotely challenging. Okay, let me state you one favorable factor: there are lots of areas interconnected with a decent map that would present you available action indications. So, there is no backtracking at all - which would be a huge plus in this genre normally. Sadly, it is not enough for me to recommend the game.For some automatic achievements coming with the game, the full price is a monstrous exaggeration. I highly recommend for you to grab this on a heavy sale, if at all.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"
,Not Recommended,485690,23693973,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,shiaakuma,"I was so looking forward to playing this, and I ended up being fairly disappointed.There is a lot of good in the game in terms of artistic value and plot; it's exactly the sort of dark, mysterious story that I like.  Some of the imagery was spot-on wonderful.  Sound and voiceover work wasn't terrible comparatively speaking.However, that said.... I cannot make a recommendation on this.The puzzles are the usual fare for this style of game but seem to be far easier than most.  I feel like puzzles should be...well, puzzling.  At least a little bit.  Some were also tedious to complete even though the puzzle itself was easy.The worst thing is the rampant mislabeling of items in the hidden object scenes.  There are a LOT of scenes in the game (which is great!) but there needed to be a lot more quality control before they released the English version, at least.  A few randomly misnamed items or typos don't bother me in the slightest, but this was in almost every HO scene and sometimes more than once per scene.  It was too much even for me, and I'm generally pretty laid-back about things like that.Examples include wrenches labeled as keys (and keys as wrenches!) and a slingshot labeled as ""forked stick"" but there are far more examples and I could fill a page with them.  Some are just irritating but some make it almost impossible to finish the scene without getting hints (i.e. a piece of pipe labeled as a ""trumpet"" is where I gave up and started hitting the hint button).It's not an expensive game and it has a pretty long playtime compared to comparable games, but the rampant errors and the boringly simple puzzles make it a ""no"" for me.  That said, if the type of story appeals to you and you don't mind hitting the hit button constantly (or random-clicking and hoping for the best), you may still enjoy it.  This is a title that could really use the ""meh maybe"" option for recommendations rather than yes or no!"

Nearly every single HO scene contained items that were mislabeled so far from what they actually were the only way to complete the scenes was to repeatedly hit the hint button or randomly click around.  Maddening.  I'm not talking about simple mistakes... I'm talking about plumbing pipes being mislabeled as trumpets... and fishing rods mislabled as winches.The puzzles were brain dead simple too.  Difficulty level on this one is incredibly low.Aside from the many dysfunctional gameplay elements and mechanics, the story itself was interesting, and the artwork isn't half bad."

Most of the puzzles are too simple, though one challenging (and one was glitched). Even the eye-spy parts were kinda of broken because of poor labeling. Half of the time the game tells you look for a wrench when in means a key, and vice versa. There are better games like this. Cannot Recommend."

It isn't bad, but quite annoying to keep hearing it from the beginning of the game until the end.-Short game.-Puzzles are extremely easy.The ending felt like an open one, plusHe shouldn't be the only one to be punished! the girls did kill the governess and he witnessed it as a child, they were bullying him as he did to them so both of them are guilty.I recommend this game if you'll tolerate the bug and willing to restart the game after a couple of hours of game play.

The list is telling me to look for a ""Key"" so I look all over for it and can't find it.  Finally, I accidentally clicked on a ""wrench""  and it clears it.  Likewise, when it asked for a ""wrench"" then I was looking for a key.  Come on folks.  I don't care what country you're from, a key is a key and a wrench is a wrench.  I was hoping it would be a bit more challenging, but other than the aforementioned confusion, it was pretty easy."

Many MANY objects are mislabeled.Examples:Pipe labeled as a trumpetKey labeled as a wrenchWrench labeled as a keyCan labeled as a bottle or jarGraple hook on a coil of rope labeled as a hook, the hook wasnt visible, only the coil of rope wasAnd the story is lame. I don't even care mostly about the story in these games, but this one was just really boring. Mostly it was told by reading notes that are way too much small type squeezed onto a too small page, so it is annoying to read.If you can get it on sale for $3 like I did, then maybe buy it if you really really like HOG but otherwise skip it."

Have to take frequent breaks so the game doesn't fry my computer. Game settings are minimal at best with zero options to adjust graphics for performance.Story is pretty good and the clues you find along the way add to it.

76561198080704090,Not Recommended,485690,33017561,Posted: 29 June,all,Tildy,"It's not a bad game, necessarily, but not good enough to recommend. The English translation is kind of iffy and often doesn't quite match the narration. The puzzles are interesting and fun, but objects are frequently misnamed, which makes hidden object scenes more difficult than necessary. At one point there was a hidden object scene with two ropes in, and the game asked you to find one rope. It had to be the one specific rope though; the other one had to stay so you could find it again later on down the line.The graphics are needlessly complicated and it can take a long time to transition from one scene to another, which is a problem when you only need to do one thing in an area and then leave to go elsewhere. Fortunately there's a fast-travel option, which cuts down a little on this.And the story, while interesting enough, is just kind of jumbled. The opening cutscene makes it clear we're looking for a missing girl. Okay, got it. A few scenes into the game, once the tutorial showing you how to gas up your car and inflate your tires is done, you find a drawing of what appears to be a witch scratched on a table. ""What a terrible drawing,"" the main character says. Okay, looks like atmosphere-building. Sounds good. But if you check your journal it shows you that same drawing along with a caption that says, ""This must be how the girls saw Mrs. Braun!"" Wait, who's Mrs. Braun? What girls? Are we at the boarding school already?Nothing is established. I feel like this is the kind of game that needs a better opening cutscene, that rolls down the suspects and victims and actually introduces the characters we're going to be dealing with.Finally, after I exited out of the game, it just stopped working. Now trying to start it up gives me the black screen-o-death. But nothing is actually dead--task manager says the game is still running, and keyboard shortcuts still work. I still haven't decided if it's worth my time to try and fix it."

The key is to keep an eye on the map feature when you get lost and be willing to not have names match some of the items in the hidden object sections.I probably wouldn't pay full price having played through it once given that I play a lot of these games and even though the artwork and voice acting is quite good the otherall game is a lot more frustrating and clunky than I expected given that it is twice the price of what I usually pay.All  in all not awful but a few minor things let it down in the end and the ending is completely unsatisfying and unimpressive for something I just spent 3+ hours playing because I wanted to know the story. This game is very almost exactly what I wanted when I found it. So close, but I wouldn't consider it a waste of my time."

Mainly because of the bad translations that make you guess through half of the hidden objects sections, but foremost because it gives off the vibe of telling the gamers (whose core demographic is around 12 I guess?) that people with autism and/or psychological diagnosises are ""bad"". I'm sure they didn't mean it, but it comes off that way, and that's just terrible.SPOILERS! We are supposed to care for and save a mentally fully functional woman who in cold blood killed someone, in favour of a ""bad guy"" who was both misstreated, bullied and suffering from handicap. PS - Not everyone suffers from their autism, but if they do in their daily life, and don't function socially with others, it is considered a handicap, but *not* otherwise. The game makes it clear the boy in question didn't work well socially = he was handicapped. The game gives you no option to turn anyone in to the proper authorities or charge the ""good"" girl with murder, and fine, it isn't that kind of game, but it just leaves a really bad taste in your mouth finishing it. SPOILERS END!Hopefully, like I said, this is only a matter of something lost in translation. But I can't stand behind such a ""statement"". If it was a matter of just explaining someones behaviour it would be one thing, but this is painting people with good and bad colors, and leaving no room for empathy or explaining beyond ""he was bad because he was weird"" and ""she deserved saving because she is a cute young woman"".It's pretty stupid and illogical as a whole, the music gets repetative fast, but I do admittedly like the artwork alot."

The map was great.  It removed a lot of tedium that some hidden object games have.  Most puzzles weren't hard, but a few were pretty tricky, for me at least.  I had to do a lot of trial and error on a couple.  The hidden objects aren't hard to find with careful observation.  As far as mislabeled objects - yes there are some, but I didn't find it to be nearly as bad as some people suggested.  For those screens that had a mislabeled object or two, a bit of random clicking took care of that problem, and I moved on.  As for the storyline itself, I really didn't pay attention to whether it made sense or not.  I simply enjoyed letting it take me thru the game.  Achievement wise?  I 100% completed the achievements pretty easitly.  AND you don't have to do TWO playthroughs to accomplish that, which is a positive to me.So if you're a game completionist, I recommend this game.  If you have to have everything be fully logical, or all neat and tidy, you might want to pass.  But I would certainly recommend this game when it's on sale."

There's a lot of laughable logic (which is nothing new for the genre, to be fair), mislabeled items in the hidden object scenes (which is annoying AF), weird word usage (""caster"" instead of ""wheel"" - though I guess it's nice for expanding your vocabulary) and the same song plays from beginning to end.

Play the game for the atmosphere and puzzles, HOG scenes will get tiresome, however.Definitely buy it on sale if you're unsure.+ . + . + . + .I saw Hope Lake on Greenlight awhile back and supported it because I am a fan of HOGs and I liked the game's concept.You play as Detective Wells, who travels out into the coastal town of Hope Lake to get to the bottom of a series of cases involving young women who are kidnapped and murdered. Driving through the woods, Wells chases a mysterious cloaked figure towards an abandoned school with a tragic history.It has somewhat of a noir feel to it, which also drew me to this game.It's a pretty game with it's dark, foggy, cob-web covered backgrounds that stretch from the beach to an abandoned all-girls boarding school. The puzzles are familiar, they're not so different from classic puzzles and mini games that can be found in other HOGs. There's even a nifty gimmick where you can use a flashlight to make it easier to find hidden items and search for light switches in dark rooms.Also, there are various photos, trinkets, and journal pages to collect that give more depth to the story, these were some of my favorite features. Also, surprisingly, there were a lot of places to explore and I strongly suggest that you use the compass to fast-travel and get around.One of the gripes I have, in particular, is the obnoxious title music that never switches to a different track, it can make the game tedious to listen to. Also, some of the items in the HOG scenes were mistranslated, or mislabeled, which made it really tiresome to have to use the hint function for the final two or three items on the list (and waiting for the hint bar to fill up again).And yet, I personally enjoyed this game for what it is, despite some of its flaws.It was just fun to go through all the beautiful, and sometimes creepy, scenery and imagine how life used to be back when it was inhabited. The puzzles were relaxing and I liked the symbolism behind them, they added a unique charm to the game and gave it a little more personality.I'll admit, it's not perfect and it may only appeal to a niche crowd, but if you're a fan of detective stories and/or HOGS, you might want to give this one a try. But, if you're uncertain of how much it's worth its merit compared to its full price, I recommend buying it on sale."

The music was the same short loop over and over, it drove me insane. (yes, I turned it off) It had funny little translation errors that made finding the hidden object a little difficult to know what you were looking for like calling a  feather duster a broom (close), a brush a comb (kind of close), a wrench a key and a key a wrench (that was the best one). :) I do recommend this game as there are worse ones out there but just keep in mind that it wasn't great.

,Recommended,485690,24310020,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,BlueManedWolf,"So let me start out by saying, I never play Hidden Object games. Not even when I was younger. I've never seen the appeal of them. Even when there were those Hidden Object books that are always in the day care centers or the kids section of the library, I never really touched them because I would just get frustrated. It wasn't interesting to me because when I look at books I look for a story, not just something to pass my time because I'm bored of living.Now this game, is a pleasant surprise. I didn't even consider it on my radar for a long time because it was a Hidden Object game, but you know what made me change my mind? Extra Credits.Now before people get all huffy or what have you about a youtube series, it's kind of true what they said about these games. They're not for the ""Hardcore Player"" that usually dominates the community, but it's still engaging.Female Protagonist can be slapped onto any female character, but this character was more than just ""I have♥♥♥♥♥♥ therefore I am female"". She is a detective, she's been hired to find kidnapped girls, and she has reckless abandon for her own safety in comparison to the victims of this story, and she's determined to solve the mystery of what's happening and the place she's stumbled upon.Which brings another point that I've mentioned prior. This has, mind you a short, but a very interesting story to follow. It's just creepy enough to make you think ""The killer is in that house! Why the hell are we doing this?!"" but with some safety to it that makes it fun to play. You have a flashlight that can shine into black/dark places, and helps ease your tension while adding to your curiosity of the story and your surroundings.Before I go overboard any more, I'll end it with this.Do you like Mystery? Puzzles? Reading? Nostalgia-inducing game animation? Being a badass lady?Then this game is probably for you.One small note though if you play, there are a lot of times where the object you're looking for may be a ""Wrench"" or a ""Key"" if you can't find one, but you can find the other, it's probably what's happening. It happened a few times while I played where the words didn't match with the object. But luckily it was (strangely) consistent, and only really happened in the later half of the game."
,Recommended,485690,29432857,Posted: 22 January,all,operationflipswitchjunkie,"This game is not a masterpiece but it delivers what you'd expect from a standard HOG.I liked the narrative. It was intriguing and I kept reading bits and pieces of letters and diary entries to gain more knowledge about the past. I was definitely invested in the story and the only thing I have to criticize is that the player doesn't have to be too bright to solve the ""mystery"" on his own. From the point I realized this, the game just turned into a puzzle-solving game, although the plot wasn't downright boring.There are a few mislabelled items and sometimes I had to click EXACTLY at a specific spot to get an item, which can be frustrating. Sometimes I simply missed the spot, assumed I was doing the wrong thing and was stuck even though I could've solved it right then and there.For me personally that wasn't much of an issue since this is a rather common thing among HOG. But I can understand that for other people this factors into how much they're willing to spend on this game.The puzzles weren't particularly challenging either, but I suppose it's difficult to find the right balance. What I consider easy, others might find frustrating.I really liked the map in this game. I got to explore a few places and it never got out of hand. I've played games where new paths open up left and right and you're stuck in a maze and overwhelmed by all the places you can go. This game kept it rather linear and still provided a map to give an overview.The cut scenes felt a little ridiculous at times, but again, to me that's fine. HOG to me simply mean puzzle solving and a little narrative on the side. If I want a story-driven game with good cutscenes and voice-acting, I'd definitely not choose a HOG.The graphics were fine too. Not out of this world, but fine.The only thing I really disliked about this game was the music. It is one track playing on a loop over and over. This irritated me to a point where I simply took off my headphones and only listened during the cut scenes.This game really could have been longer but given the narrative, it was quite all right to end where it did.I personally enjoyed it and would recommend it, but I can understand that others would not enjoy it as much - particularly anal people.It wasn't a GREAT game or anything amazing, but it's fun and relaxing and I like looking for hidden objects and exploring some settings, just a bit of point-and-click for a calm weekend afternoon."

I found everything very quickly, within a minute or two of starting the scene.- The puzzles themselves were also very easy. It's one thing to have the HO scenes be easier but it's another if the HO scenes and the puzzles are that easy.- The music was just too repetitive. I realize these sorts of games have the same music in most scenes, but this was a bit much. The devs didn't even try to vary it from location to location.- The achievements were way too easy to get. This particular HOG didn't have any of the ones you might win by not skipping cut scenes or asking for a hint. All of these achievements were given just by doing the things you have to do in order to proceed in the game.All in all, I don't recommend this game. If you really have to get it, wait until a sale.I don't plan on finishing it."
76561198046065881,Recommended,485690,29955391,Posted: 15 February,all,Crux,"Good all around P&C/HOG mystery. Not the best, but at least as good as (maybe even little better) than average. Graphics, artwork, and story were all good. The game includes a map with present location and next available action (which I like). There's a good amount of gameplay and I enjoyed it, so I'm giving it a recommend.However, as many of the reviews note, there are some misnamed hidden objects. But thanks to said reviews, I had a pretty good idea of what to look for and so the misnamed objects were easy to get past (there aren't too many to begin with anyway - which does make me wonder why the devs haven't already corrected them). If you're on the fence with this one, get it on sale - I doubt you'll have regrets.Also, the game played well for me on Linux Mint 18 (Wine/PlayOnLinux) with one exception. Not sure if this is a Linux related issue, but the dropdown text (i.e., the hints/story text that appears in a dropdown box at the top of the screen at helpful points throughout the game) was not visible for me. I could see the dropdown box appear when expected, but with no text inside it. This turned out to be less of an issue than I first thought. Because in most instances, what needed to happen (i.e., a mini game needed another puzzle piece to work, the bolt needs oiling before the wrench can loosen it, and all the other gimmicks one always finds in these games) was apparent. And there was always the hint button and the next available action indicator in the map to move things along if necessary. So by the end of the game, I had forgotten all about it and it didn't end up detracting from my enjoyment.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.2 hrs as of the time of this review, although I've played at least 5 hrs and have completed the game."

For a point-and-click mystery game the cut scenes and voice acting (what little of it there was) were fairly good quality and the story itself seemed compelling. Additionally, the game offered a large interactive map one could use to teleport to specific rooms  instead of having to walk from screen to screen.  However, after playing through this game in its entirety I feel that  it is important to note the sheer number of errors this game has. At first there was just a typo here or there, but as the game progresed some of the hidden object games become almost impossible to complete (especially if you are someone like me who likes a challenge and doesn't often use the hint button) due to the mislabeling of objects. More so, the hit boxes for objects were very small. There were several cases where I got stuck in the game because I was looking for an item I had already clicked on or I had attempted to use an item on the correct object but been told that wasn't the correct action. Additionally, if one is able to put aside all of the techinical glitches, the puzzles themselves are almost painfully simple. There was no real challenge here, and though the story was intriguing I feel like it just couldn't make up for how annoying this game became once progress became near impossible due to the technical errors."

,Recommended,485690,29292121,Posted: 16 January,all,WidescreenRules,"With a flood of HO games (not that I'm complaining), this is one of the better ones if you're looking for something to take up some time without being frustratingly difficult. Clocking in at over three hours, you get a lot of time in with this one and the overall quality is quite good.The art design is up to par with HO games. Everything is hand painted and looks as good as would be expected. The story is actually pretty good. At its core it's a believable revenge tale that doesn't rely on superstitious hocus pocus like a lot of HO games do. All achievements are story-based, so you'll get all of them during playthrough. Hints are simply that - hints - that don't punish you by denying you achievements because you dared to ask for help. And what little voice acting is in it above par for most HO games.If there is one big negative it's that this game was clearly not properly translated for the American market. There are many HO items that won't make sense to some Yankees. For example, ""electrical tape"" became ""friction tape"". (Both are available in the US but in all of my years of home improvement I've never heard of friction tape before now.) A ""frame"" was not a picture frame or anything similar but was instead some item that I couldn't identify. Vinyl (as in audio records) was spelled ""vinil"" (French? Brazillian?) Fretsaws are more likely to be called ""hacksaws"" in the US. ""Fetters"" are more likely to be called ""shackles"". And in irony of ironies, a statue of an American football player is identified as a soccer player! There are a few more examples, but you get the idea. The ending was rather abrupt and some of the backstory wasn't explained, but you can make assumptions from what was presented.Still, this was one of the better HO games I've played, and I've played a lot. It was straightforward, more logical than a lot of HO games, not very punishing (which can be refreshing), and a decent way to spend a few hours. If you like HO games, buy this."

The descriptions on some of the clue games are not very accurate - obvioulsy English wasn't a first language, and would have been good to have a proof over them. Also some of the click to activate spaces were not very accurate, so I needed to click multiple times to activate, or I would have to use the hint to figure out what I ha to do next. Most of the mini games were relatively easy, which was lucky as there was few instructions as to how to complete them.Overall a nice game, but prepare to have some frustrations."
,Not Recommended,485690,30017015,Posted: 18 February,all,Angahareth,"I wanted to like this game. The story seemed interesting enough. But I couldn't take it anymore with that interface. Especially the travel - every time you move between scenes, it takes a while to let you click on anything. This slows down gameplay  and is super frustrating - moving more than one location away takes forever unless you fast travel (which is also super slow)."

The atmosphere is sufficiantly moody and if you're looking for something simple that wont make you think at all you'll find about 2 hours of entertainment here."

,Recommended,485690,29562867,Posted: 29 January,all,MaorGadol,"Hope Lake is a very pleasant and complex puzzle game with an interesting criminal plot. More I play, more complex it becomes but I like the game a lot. One of the silly things is that the “Achievements” description can be a spoiler revealing the identity of a person in the cloak (I am talking about the achievement called “Rescue” – don’t look at it. I looked at it once and regret it now). The other silly thing is that the “Achievements” haven’t downloaded properly when I started playing the game. As a result some early achievements haven’t showed up on my profile although I unlocked them all. So it could have been another “perfect game” but hey, I surely took a lesson from it. I will wait next time for everything to download and settle properly before I start playing."

I got it in one of the Steam seasonal sales. I think this is a pretty decent point and click game.  As others have indicated, some of the hidden object clues are broken and that did lead to a bit of frustration.  I had played the game for about four hours before I realised there was a map available when you click in the compass on the toolbar.  The map was helpful because at some points the hidden object areas re-activate and it indicated where you could progress the story.  It took me about six hours to finish the game.  I think the artwork was pretty good and the music was OK.  The puzzles were challenging but not impossible, some were a bit easy.I give this game 7 / 10. Get it on sale."

For a ""puzzle"" game/search and find game, it's well made. I played on easy mode first, and completed the game in one sitting in under five hours, while watching TV. If you're looking for something to pass the time, without any thought to it, then this is the game for you. If you want to actually think about what you're doing, and have to come back to the game another day because you didn't finish, then you may want to look elsewear. All in all, I guess I would recommend the game, but if given the chance again, I probably wouldn't purchase it."

Puzzles did not offer much of a challenge. Some of the hidden object screens annoying due to item mislabeling. Good for achievement hunters. Would recommend if on sale.
