,Recommended,485730,24959805,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Timmy Turner,"Not played it much but I like the game, nice and relaxing.Just a few things that I think could improve the game, firstly with the ranked mode, once you complete a level pressing continue should take you to the next level, currently it takes you to the main menu which is a slight inconvenience.When the path is in progress time should not continue, there should also be a way to either skip the pathing or speed it up."

The thing that irked me the most is that there is no option to retry or restart a level -- you have to back out all the way to the Main Menu and go through several menus just to get to another playable puzzle. Poor interface design that is frustrating!! Also, I feel the anime chick really doesn't fit with the game nor does she add anything!"

Very suspicious :/ ).The levels seem to be randomly generated - they’re not fun to play and just get repetitive."

76561198047900193,Recommended,485730,29610354,Posted: 31 January,all,ShanaAisaka,"I'm here to review the game. First of all when you have just download the game it while load for some few minutes guys. Don't worry and just wait until the game has load. There is no need to close the game or restart it. The game is really confusing at first. I will explain it a bit how to play. It has also got a nice background songs, really relaxing. This game is suitable for those who loves puzzles games and like to play calm games. It is worth to kill some times ~- See that blue colour point ? that is where u start the game.- If you still doesn't see that blue point just see for which colour is blue okay!- Use ""Spacebar'' (<---keyboard) and the line will automatic goes to where u have line it up.- You will lose if you did not make the target score.- You can also move the direction of the pointer when u have click ""Spacebar""- You will need to back to main menu when u lose but if u lose early you will get the ""restart'' button there.I know some of this has already got in game ""How to Play"" but just in-case if someone still confusing about the game.Have fun playing everyone ! I love this type of game !"

I haven't played it much, but from what I have played, I can tell that it's something that you can play if you feel like just winding down for the night, or if you just played a bad game of something and you need something to calm you down. Especially with the simple gameplay and the game's soundtrack being particularly calm."

,Recommended,485730,30029722,Posted: 19 February,all,FuryForce,"As a 100% impulse buy, I really like where this game is going, the concept is soild the mechanics are solid. I think it could use some Aesthetic tweaks, but for the price you really cant expect the world of it. Its definately addicting though I think with some additional aesthetic content it could be a even more addicting game.I havent had to much time to mess about with it but the time I did spend on the small board, you are definately going to find it enjoyable and most likely really start scratching your head for the larger boards. Ill have to pick it up again soon!But as it is, 0.99 cent you cant really complain.Definately recommend checking this one out if you got some spare change or like the concept from the screen shots/video guys and gals!   7/10"

76561198142103348,Recommended,485730,30682865,Posted: 23 March,all,XDHUGOSXD,"1. why i got this game:Biology class: combined all of my WoTB trading cards and got a discount for this game.Break: bought the game and downloaded it.History class: recieved 3 trading cards while playing this game.break: sold those and thereby earnt more money from it than i spent on game.Math class: writing this.2. why l love this game:good music and gameplay, easy to learn but you always make silly mistakes.in my opinion if you want good music then buy FTL, but if you want to play a game in school like me then buy this."
,Recommended,485730,29867614,Posted: 12 February,all,VULGAR31,It's a good game. You learn the strategy then improve your vision. Soundtracks are amazing and game is relaxing actually.The content can be improved tough.I recommend this game.
