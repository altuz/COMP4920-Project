Also the developers are really on the ball and very open to suggestions to controls/gameplay/etc. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a fun and addictive little puzzler like Tetris with a twist."

It still has a way to go but im looking forward to when the glitches are fixed. Here are some of the things that need to be changed:-It takes WAY too long for the next piece to come out. Once your current piece lands, there is a large delay between when it lands and when your turn stops. This would be okay if you could still move, but you can't. The piece just sits there until it thinks that turn is over.-The pieces fall too fast. It would be a big help if you could change the fall speed, difficulty, etc.-The pieces fall like they are affected by gravity. This wouldn't be a problem except that the physics are buggy. Every once in a while a piece will bounce and go flying off, sometimes out of the boundaries.-The white pieces are glitchy. Occasionally you will be able to control the white piece, but most of the time it just goes back and forth, left and right. This sometimes messes up lines that are set up.-We need two rotate buttons. One clockwise, the other counter-clockwise. It would also be nice if the pieces stayed in place when rotating instead of moving around.That's about all I can think of at the moment. I hope these get fixed soon.Thank you for your time!"

It got 3 different game modes and the goal is to connect 4 or more cubes ( same color) in order to pass levels and get more points. I am looking forward to see more powerups and modes.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=711382541"
,Recommended,485740,23970142,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,The Crazy Zonie,"I love Tetris style games, but I would tentitively recomend this game.(Note: This is a revised review is based on the patch that came out on July 25th, 2016.)The developers addressed two of the issues in my previous review. There is now an instructions page that pretty clearly explains how to play the game. The only thing it wasn't completely clear on was which blocks are cleared with the line being cleared. (Only the ones directly touching the line being cleared, if they are the same color.)Second, menu setting values for music and sound now save across all menu and game screens. Set it once and it sticks between screens.Figured out the control issue reported in the past review is a bug. I suspect the issue has to do with collision detection algorythm. Left, Right, Rotate Left and Rotate Right will stop working in some instances where a collision with either the walls or falling into a well of pieces, even through there is room to move away from the obstruction or flip the pieces.Since the developers did repond to my critisim of their game and have fixed some of the issues I brought up, I can move this review up to a tentative recomends. If they fix the collision detection bug, I would definately move this review up to a strong recomends.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Old review below. Changed recomendation from would not to tentitively would recomend.This game does not have any tutorial system or anything to explain how it's played. After playing the game, I still can't tell you how to eliminate rows.In game, controls will stop working as some pieces fall down. I don't know if this is a game mechanic or a bug, and if it's a game mechanic, what triggers it. Again, no explanation for it.Controls are Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Down Arrow and Space. Most Tetris games use either the entire arrow pad and/or WASD. It's a Unity game, so I'm assuming you can change this in the starting screen before going into the game, but there is NO OPTIONS MENU in the game.There are two options that appears on every screen: Volume and Sound. Volume goes quickly from no sound to very loud and then doesn't seem to have a noticable affect after moving the slider more than 1/8th of the way. Sound turns all sounds on and off. There is no separate sliders for music and sound effects. (and the sound track increases in volume periodically. The game does not remember what you set the controls to when you change screens. Going from Main Menu, the Game screen, back to Main menu requires fiddling with the sounds three times.The interface looks nice, but game elements appear in the main menu and may be confused with the main menu elements. I have no idea what the spaceship themed UI is supposed to mean or if the gameprogress has any affect on the animated background, but that is distracting.Overall, I would love to say this is an interesting twist on the Tetris concept. However, I have no idea what the dev was trying. Some of these issues (UI design, menus, and options that don't stick) are all things taught in introduction programming and game design courses, so I'm scratching my head.UPDATE:I went back and looked at the Unity starting menu. The Input selection does let you change the keys, but all the control names are for ship/character movement and not a Tetris style game. This definately feels like a game put together by someone just learning the trade. Still a ""Don't Buy"" recomendation"

If you play it off line, you have to wait for your scores/achievements to show. Good FUN GAME. Spent probably 200 OR MORE hours on it lol"
,Recommended,485740,24496675,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,Dela,The game has many good ideas but its still stuck in its infancy.Pro:+ cool style+ 3 funny modes+ cool electronic musicCons:- lines dont vanish sometimes- time doesnt reset in speed trial- sometimes new blocks dont come- then this happend:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730507571Even though there arent that many bugs its still lessening the experience of the game.I would recommend to wait till the game is finish or a few of these bugs are patched.But over all its worth buying and a funny game

Very good practice for developers to follow."

Uh oh, that's a bad sign.2. Start a new game... WHAT DO I DO? How do I rotate? A nice ""How to"" on first run of game would be nice if you're not using ""classic"" keys to rotate.3. Oh no, you're close to the wall, you shall not rotate a piece here! You're close to a laid piece, YOU SHALL NOT ROTATE OR MOVE AWAY, drop your piece here.I could go on, but wasted too much time on really trying hard to like this game by playing it some more.I want my money back."
,Not Recommended,485740,24787080,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,inthetatras,"As a Tetris fan and owner of Tengen Tetris I would have loved this game so much... if it weren't so buggy. The controls are so-so. About what you'd expect for a casual puzzle game with tetromino style configurations. The graphics are great. The music is relaxing and easily melts into the background while you're playing. The problem... is that blocks keep disappearing instead of settling where I've placed them, especially when that placement should yield me a line and knock out a bunch of blocks. Blocks randomly disappear. I've even had a block fall into the very bottom corner of the container and stay stuck partially outside of it, where no block should normally be able to reach in the first place.I also couldn't get any of the powers to work despite using the keys indicated in the How to Play section. The leaderboards are blank.This game feels like it needs some extra time in beta to work out the bugs before it should be available to the public. It could be a great casual game. Instead it's just frustrating in how it only sometimes works properly."

I found a cool variant of tetris. The main mechanic is making a 4+ line of blocks of same color. The thing is you have 4 power-ups you can activate to help you and as you progress through the game and make more lines, you will earn extra charges of these powers.This makes for an interesting dynamic of trying to put pieces where the should and using power-ups when things get too dicey.Presentation is very good, I enjoyed the futuristic look, albeit it might be a bit too colored... on the other hand, color is in the title :)One thing I found missing... I would have liked to see the upcoming piece. This might be just me used to tetris though, it's not a biggie.PS Seems my avatar has a bit of color syndrom too... :D"

I like that pressing esc will shut and save the game instantly, I don't like that I get the occasional glitch which freezes the cubes briefly and  on one occasion told me I had lost because the cubes froze at the top of the window - I had a good score at that point as well, grr, but hey, it is just a game and it fills the odd moments when  there is nothing much else to do"
