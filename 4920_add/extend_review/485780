It functions as some kind of wireless charging from the cosmos. It soothes me, it steadies me, and it somehow removes me (for a time) from having to consider the scope of my failure as a human being. It is the closest thing I have to a god.Sound Stage appears to be the #1 VR music creation app, and will probably be the Tilt-Brush of the genre for along time."

My favorite! The reaction time is excellent!- You'll spend hours just playing with the maracas! So cool!- Intuitive! Which is amazing considering everything this software can do!Now for the bad stuff:- I hate having to hold the trigger down to hang onto a drumstick or maraca. The Vive triggers are known to get sticky with use. Constantly holding them down can't be good for the hardware. Besides, it doesn't feel right.- Needs spatial audio.I give this one a 9/10 as an early access rating! Excellent work so far!"

It is not a game or a DAW replacement, but an infinite number of sound studios.Pros:Cheap - This much audio gear would cost you millions.Huge - So many possible combinations of gear which can be saved and revisitedDiverse - interesting intruments and effects can be chained to create awesome soundsEvolving - the dev is very responsive and updates have been both big and fast.Complex - This a pro and a con. There is a lot to learn, like any new music production software. Luckily the dev is producing a series of helpful youtube guides and responds to questions.Cons:Slow - it would be difficult to use for live instrumental performance without a patient audience or a lot of preconfigured set ups.Unfinished - This is early access, it is clearly unfinished and in some cases unoptimised. The mic seems to have a slight delay on subsequent tracks.Hardware limited - Inherits the limitations of the platform, instruments are like playing with one finger on each hand and the headset microphone is not that great.Summary:There are many things I'd like to see added, like pedal support and easier live looping, but it is an amazing concept and the development trajectory has been seriously impressive so far.  I could easily see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this once complete."

I would like to see some beat matching and vst integration, i have yet to wrap my head around the midi inputs but will work on that shortly. it's a really really good concept which with some more refinement could become truly great, Values on the Knobs would be a great start so you know what tempo etc you have turned them to! also some kind of syncing to stop samples drfting away from the bpm... I read the devs comment on reddit that he was wrapping up development on version 1 of this software. I hope he decides otherwise as at the moment its kind of a funky demo rather than a music production suite. He's so close to making a real mark here but he's not quite there yet. All in all very happy for the cash and i will continue to play with it and hope for further dev work,Edit : I have to add a proviso now to this review in that i do not believe this program is finished. it's out of early access, development has stopped, yet there are still many features that stop it being the program it could have been such as vst for instance. Its still a good laugh but its not for the serious musician. I would rate it neutral now as i was disapointed where it stopped but i would stop short of negative"

Bashing away at the drums with the Vive controllers is more rewarding than it should be :)Connecting the various bit of gear together is a breeze, just drag and drop the cables from one device to the next.  I especially love walking across the room to plug the cables in from the sampler tapes to the sequencer, it's something you have to experience to fully appreciate :)The upcoming ""piano roll"" feature will lift many of the current restraints and allow for much more scope than is currently available.

At first I took it to be just a toy, but after updates and a lot more time spent with different musicians and novices it has revealed it's true proof-of-concept to me. This is the first time emulated hardware has ever been so directly represented in a digital space, much less a virtual one. You think of your 'Reason' softwares (sorry if that's a way out of date rack software, that's the only one I know form back in the day) that emulate beat machines and samplers and whatnot, but this is a step up. Being able to grab them and move them around and pull plugs to connect them is incredibly efficient, effective, and immersive. Building your digital sample tape rack that you pull out and then punch into the samplers is fantastic. For the price you'd be insane not to buy it if you own a Vive. Even if you just want to dabble, it's really easy to enjoy. It makes so much sense to anyone that touches it within minutes. Some VR stuff gets me hyped for the future of creative softwares and this is some of that stuff right up there with Tilt Brush."

It does lack in areas but thats what differs this from a proffessianal sound kit.There are alot of things that could be done to improve this, but for the price you cant fault what you can achieve. If you had ever used ""Reason"", its great you can make use of the wires like this, but its not as powerful as reason.I made 2 great drump loops stacking and splitting tapes onto the sequencer, but after this, I couldnt find myself being able to apply an effect like Reverb on some of the drum kits. Best I could really do is just control the volume and speed.Osc are missing a few features, as I felt rather limited when experimenting to make a synth over my song. The noises it provided were far from great sounding and just lots of beeps and bloops, nothing like a WahWah or LFO to play with things alot.The ability to Pause the sequencer would be great, instead I used the Cube to just turn volume down(by linking/splitting volume across my 4 tape Kicks, 3 tape snare and 2 tape HH, but bringing back up I could find a nicer sound than before. Being able to control and plug this into the mixer would be easier, but thats not an option.For now, 6/10- as It does feel like a limited experience and not full freedom. Making a basic drum loop is fun(even tho you ideally need to stack near EVERY kick provided for a great hit sound)hitting some other things for beeps and boops is great(i.e marracas hooked up to a Osc.. why?)outside this, you cant ""make"" a sound- but thats maybe cos I just kept on wanting to dive deeper...Score will go higher when more work on synth/osc is provided and a few extra sample packs."

I was going to write a review but I thought it would be more personal to email you directly since you have left your email. I just wanted to say thank you for designing an awesome music app. Sound stage is fast becoming my most used vr app. Your interest in music really shows through in the design and feel of what is/will be a really powerful tool.I have played around with reason 3 and although I could put together a tune I didn't really feel like I knew what I was doing or why the sound was responding in the way that it was. With sound stage I feel like I am learning as I play much faster than with any other sound program. I put my 11 year old nephew into this and he quickly knocked up a beat as good as anyone. The accessibility of sound stage makes it a real game changer for music production

,Not Recommended,485780,33299672,Posted: 5 July,all,Tyler,"I've used albleton live and garage band and even some ipad apps, this is worse. the microphone has way too much latency to be usable. the gear is severely limited. Using a midi keyboard, you can only use two octaves then it says midi key too low/high and doesnt activate any note, theres no way to expand the range of the virtual keyboards to make a 88 key fully usable. its also not very efficient either, takes a long time to get things working and gets in the way of creative flow. its got a learning curve but even after that, its not that expressive. the main detractor for me is the mic latency, i just want to mess with a mic looper setup, cant. also the mic quality is garbage on the rift. its worse than a walmart $2 mic even though the Rifts actual mic sound is great. I tried installing sound drivers I don't need and it didn't help.Overall, its novel and fun to show to others new to VR, but not something I'll be investing much more time into even when I have a music itch."

Now, a whole new realm for performers, musicians, producers and even audio engineers has been opened. The full impact of Logans creation has yet to be realized or truly appreciated.  SoundStage is the evolution in music creation. The updates are made often and are logical, pushing the boundaries of the amount of control you can have and most importantly, workflow.

It's cool to see something original and fresh in VR - something with a great interface... now to add more functionality.

It's missing some key modules (delay, distortion, filters, polyphonic synths and samplers, pattern sequencer...) that would open up a ton of new space for experimentation, but it's early days yet.

,Not Recommended,485780,29064948,Posted: 6 January,all,seanny,"I wouldn't recommend SoundStage in its current state. Its glowy and tactile UI makes a slick first impression, but when one tries to use it as a modular groovebox, connecting sequencers to sounds & effects, it's limitations and bugs become apparent. Modules become mirrored; jacks become incorrectly sized; the lack of a standalone ADSR unit puts a damper on meaningful synth programming. Making the simplest things necessitates a cornucopia of interconnected devices, and its inability to consolidate the sprawl makes for a virtual ergonomic disaster.In other words, SoundStage lacks the elegance and focus necessary for a pleasant workflow in VR, and it lacks the sophistication to produce conventionally good music. It's at least a year of development away from reaching that point. As of now it's only a curious VR demonstration. (Perhaps if your genre is noise or ambient you'll find more to like in SoundStage, but again, the depth isn't there.)"

I have been using computers since 2002, and gamed extensively on both consoles and PCs, yet I never found any music-related app or game compelling and attractive enough for me to spend my money and time on. Rockband never appealed to me as well, and I asked for a refund for Audioshield (VR) after using it for only 20 minutes.Then I found Soundstage (through Reddit and a video review). The rest was history. The app allowed me to not only to respond to music but also create music the way I like, in VR. I can take the musical instruments and put them wherever I like, and connect them to whatever I want to make whatever I want. I can grab a set of virtual drumsticks with my virtual hands and play drums just like I would in real life. There's no longer the need to find huge amount of space to keep your musical instruments in and the money to buy and safeguard them.Gone are the days when I'm tinkering with my keyboard and drums at 3 AM and all of a sudden my neighbor knocks on the door shouting at me telling me to stop. I can now experiment with music in VR without bothering my neighbors thanks to this VR technology and Soundstage. The app makes my Vive complete, and I believe HTC/Valve should make an arrangement with the developer to offer the app as a bundle (just like how they did with TiltBrush).If you have even a passing interest in creating music, you got to give it a try. I can personally guarantee you that even if you are not a professional and you think you are not good at music, you'll still love it and have lots of fun. At $10 the price is insanely cheap as well. I have seen a few similar apps on Viveport that are selling for more than $60, and they aren't as remotely good as Soundstage.I found the developer to be more communicative, friendly and social than many other AAA software companies I've dealt with. I have personally contacted him to request a feature which involves bass pedals functionality and he promised me he'll add it to the app soon. He releases a decent amount of updates, new features and bug fixes regularly as well. In comparison, it took 8 years for Rockstar to release a patch for GTA 4 to make the game playable on Windows 8 and 10.Finally, if you want me to make a TL;DR version of my long review, I'll put it like this: Own a music studio for $10 with Soundstage and prepare to have your mind blown! It's pretty much the TiltBrush of VR."

You cant set a cue point in the sotware correctly, tjhey should atleast allow to use both controllers to zoom right in on a wave form to assist with marking the cue point corretly here.  On the DJ / Mixing side it is not good at all. You cannot cue any songs to get ready to mix in correctly, you have to guess, you can't push the track forward to bring it in time.. You cannot change the bpm to mix correctly. You need to already make sure that the BPM is the same before you try mix.

,Recommended,485780,24768407,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,Kraftmatic,"For the current Early Access price of $10, this VR music application is a steal.  Over the years I have used FL Studio, Sonar, Acid Music, Traktor, and Maschine.  SoundStage has the potiential to replace a lot of those softwares and hardware.  And since it is music software rather than a game, it offers a lot more replay than most of the VR games currently out there.  So far this is one of my favorite VR applications.  I can't wait to see what new features are added in the future.Pros:It has a solid selection of instruments and samples to get you started plus the ability to record and import your own samples.You can program your own synths.  To start creating your own synths and sounds, take a look at the tutorials and edit the instruments in there to see how each works.  Wiring the modules together is very easy and intuitive.You play play multiple instruments simultaneously and there isn't any distortion.Most instruments are low latency.Using virtual instruments saves a lot of real world space.Cons:Latency varies depending on the instrument.  The keyboard currently has the most delay I've noticed.There isn't a way to save multiple patterns in the step sequencer.  Having a way to switch between patterns using the same sequencer would be nice instead of switching between different sequencers/samplers.Limited number of save slots.  It would be nice to be able to name projects and have separate save files for projects.No effects modules yet.Future Updates and Instrument Suggestions:Add some effects modules including reverb, echo, distortion, etc.A piano roll for the step sequencer would be nice for programming melodies with the synths.Having some preset sounds for the synths and keyboard and/or a way to save and load presets would be great.A 2-channel DJ mixer with crossfader curve adjust would be good for scratching.  Just use the trigger grab the crossfader and the controller to move the crossfader.A turntable to play samples/loops/songs in .wav or .mp3 would work well for remixing tracks and scratching.  Use the trigger to grab/stop the sample.  Moving forward or back on the controller changes the direction and speed of the sample.  Releasing the trigger plays the sample from the point it was stopped.Drum pads could use a programmable drum roll using the trigger for the roll.Updated 11/24/2016:This is currently my favorite music and VR software on Steam.Additional Pros:Frequent patches with issue updates and new features added.The new sample library has plenty of classic kits (808, 909, rock, etc) to give users plenty pf sounds to get started working with.Unlimited saves.New mixer allows for crossfading (but no crossfader curve adjust yet).Effects modules added.Minor Con:Losing track/project saves after patching can be frustrating.  But I think this is probably due to more features and instruments being added requires changed the save format as well.  Hopefully this is resolved when the software is in a more finalized state.Future Updates and Instrument Suggestions:Still hoping for a turntable-like instrument.  You can kind of scratch (or at least get some interesting sounds) using the X-Y-Z axis controller but  currently sounds only play forward or backward depending on the direction selected on the sampler.  Adding a controllable forward/reverse switch on the sampler for use with one of the X-Y-Z axis triggers would work well.The mixer could use a crossfader curve adjustment option. A steep curve works better for scratching and sharper cut ins, while the current gradual fade in/out of the crossfader works better for mixing.Synth/keyboard sound presets and the ability to create new presets would be great."

I've been looking forward to piecing together a little music studio in my house in the future, and wow -- Soundstage essentially makes it all possible right in VR. No need to build any shelves!I'm still learning a lot about how everything works together, but it's pretty intuitive. Little help buttons are actually really helpful, pointing out how everything works input-and-output wise. Everything has such a natural feel; samples existing in the form of little 8-track-style cartridges; drums -- everything, really -- moveable to exactly where you want it; recording and exporting and importing stuff is a cinch.It's also very exciting to see the developer releasing some pretty substantial updates just in the small span of time this has been available. New instruments, lots of tweaks. Very exciting.My only complaint would be the quality of some of the samples seems a little low, but hey, you can add your own. Also, it would be cool if there was a way to record the whole room at once instead of instrument by instrument (multitrack export to REAPER or something would be even better). And maybe I haven't found it yet, but a voice recorder/microphone with modulation stuff would be something I hope is in the pipeline.One more thing re: online band; developer, are you familiar with NINJAM?

But I will say, there is a lot you can do if you are creative ( I will  get to this later).Oscillators have a simple slider for shape change, that's fine. They can also function as an LFO and modulate each other parameters. I don't think the modulation accuracy is super precise at high rate so it's hard to do things like FM synthesis but you can get some cool effects in both low and high mode. There are no filters and no effects, no way to precisely change all parameters with envelopes (There is one on the keyboard but you can't be super picky about how it works, it  just changes volume as far as I can tell.). Basically it's an oscillator. Oscillators are neat.The sampler is really nice as is the sequencer. The sequencer doesn't do much but trigger samples or whatever, but you can change the amount of rows, columns just by dragging.My favorite part of this is the recorder. You can basically create a big array of these and use it like a loop station. You can set it up to record, feed some samples and oscillators into it, then tweak and make cool little sweeps and any cool sound you can come up with (there are TONS of ways to make cool sounds. Then you can feed that into a mixer or whatever, possibilites are endless and it will always stay in sync with teh song.Another cool thing to do is use the oscillators to modulate the pitch of the samplers.This isn't going to replace reaktor or your DAW any time soon.

I got to the point where I'd sit down and pull up things and start connecting away. One annoying feature is that if you have other devices playing and pull up a huge speaker, the other devices will go lower (aka there seems to be a db level ceiling) which ends up requiring a bit of mixing. I understand why it's like that (so you don't blow your eardrums) but I would rather have complete control.Either way, great game, great experience, super fun to put drums overhead and just play away like an idiot."

The intuitive user interface (selecting components, connecting them, adjusting them) stands out for me.    I've used a number of Digital Audio Workstation programs, this one, although not as feauture rich, was pretty easy to grasp the essentials of, and get started making sounds right away. (Don't get me wrong, it has a lot of features.)I love the way you can customize the environment for your project, moving instruments and drumpads, reverb units, samplers, what have you into whatever layout you prefer.   ""Plugging"" components into each other is as easy as drawing a line in the air.Visually, it's kind of a treat too, with the glowing connection lines all around, and various solid geometric shapes.   Just a minor plus to an enjoyable sonic experience.   If you love playing around with sound, I'd recommend SoundStage."

76561198069469295,Recommended,485780,34043901,Posted: 5 August,all,The Glad Scientist,"This is the greatest piece of software ever written, and it has completely transformed my life. It literally almost brings me to tears that it exists in its simply intuitive yet powerful form.I will explain in detail:-Firstly, this is one of the best built for VR experiences out there. No shearing, jittering or any loss of detail graphically, and I have played this for 5-8 hrs straight with no side effects whatsoever (minus euphoria).-This is literally the best of both worlds for electronic musicians. You have tactile feedback using hardware, while you still have many affordances of software, and can even use the simpler components to create logic-based reactions that mimic the algorithmic qualities of Max MSP or puredata.-The similarities to modular sythesis and ""pulse-based"" interaction between components makes building innovative and original instruments possible, and duplication and tweaking of these as simple as ""click-drag"".-Everyone has a different approach, and that is welcomed by the software's design. You can sit down and be a drummer, put twenty synths in a circle, or build chains of oscillators and filters to form effects and control sequences. There is so much room for creativity, and with the last addition of MIDI in/out it opens the doors for even more possibilites.-The limitations in options and components forces creativity. You literally get the chance to create effects from scratch using real synthesis, filters, and reverb, which serves as an educational tool to better understanding many complex effects present in other softwares.-The documentation is SO good! It's incredible that you can click a tooltip next to an instrument and be given a detailed video lesson in app on what it does and some of its possibilities.-It costs $10. Seriously, that is insane for the amount of work put into this project.Yes, there are a few challenges in workflow to using SoundStage if you are used to a normal DAW. My biggest challenge is that there is no file browser within VR to manage samples, etc. I guess it's easier to drag and drop on a computer, but sometimes in the flow of things that becomes a...drag. If you are a synth nerd,  into hardware, or into music programming, however, you will find a lot of familiar affordances (much of the signal flow can be equated to something in between node-based programming or modular synthesis). If used in conjunction with other tools (hello, MIDI) this becomes the one of the most powerful interfaces for music ever created. Just last night I used MIDI out to run live visuals that were synced with my samples and could be modulated using the curves created by SoundStage's oscillators and 3D control cubes. C'mon, the possibilities here!Many people will steer away from the software now that it is no longer under development, but if you're looking for a VR music creation tool to either have fun with or take seriously, don't sleep on SoundStage. And IF Google hired Logan to work on a music app (which I reallllly hope is the case)...watch out for that one, because I'm sure it'll be bad news haha.As you can tell, I have put a few hours into using this software, and have mastered many of its intricacies, however it continues to impress me with its depth...the more creative and adventurous I am, the more I am rewarded. I think it's safe to say I am currently one of the forefront artists using SoundStage to play live gigs, and with EVERY iteration on my sets I discover so many more possibilities for expression and future direction. If you are at ALL interested in musical interfaces or exploring music in a new way, this is 100% for you. This software has completely changed my life experience, and I would recommend it to every single person who owns a VR system, period. It is one of those apps that cracks open a portal to the future, and allows creative thoughts about what is possible in Virtual Reality to pour through with ease."
