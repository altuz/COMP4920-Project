Set your egg-timer for 60 minutes and press start.Then when it beeps make up a random result which is usually negative.   I caught one fish in three real life days.I failed at chopping logs,  failed at starting fires,  failed at making it back from the backyard of my cabin because I got lost and I even failed at sleeping because I'm <my character is> such an idiot and didn't open the window for four hours trying to sleep,  I got heat exhaustion too because I guess my character is so dumb.    I know my weekly bath would have been the end of my poor guy,  He was sure to drown forgetting to pull his head out of the bath water...  and I would probably have to watch an egg timer for 2 hours in real time before he drowned I'm sure.Then lets talk about the completely imbalanced game mechanics.    For instance, Eating one fish fillet gave me 60 points of energy along with a list of other benefits..   Sleeping for four hours gave me 15 energy,   then just walking into my backyard I would burn 35 energy to go fishing.  Somebody failed math here.So basically my play experience was a combination of watching timers and reading failed results,Something to note: If you look at the discussion boards on this game it seems the developers are more interested in promoting their product than improving this game.  Get ready for their new content?  No thanks considering the quality.This is undeniably the worst game I ever purchased on steam.   I'm sure I'm way past a refund because I look for diamonds in the rough.NOPE, No diamonds here at all.  Sloppy Game, poor interface, poor mechanics, horrible play-ability and terrible game experience that is easily sums up this 4 day experience in one sentence:   This was a total waste of my time.But really,  Go ahead and give these guys your 10 dollars.  How bad can this game be?   You have 14 days to ask for a refund.   I just read that in the refund policy!  Woot! <chuckles>"

But the premise of the game is good. Its a survival game, and survival is hard. Yes, there are various issues with the game that are not working ideally, but the development team has been very active and is working diligently on patches now. They have gone so far as to help individual users with virtually any question or problem, just ask. This is not a sign of abandonware or a money grab. It's a n unexperienced development team that's trying as hard as they can to make a quality product. This  is worthy of anyone who enjoy's survival game genre support.Yes, its not an easy game. There is alot to learn, and there are a few rough and buggy bits... but it's getting better, and will have a huge replayability factor once it's completed."

If you require instant gratification from your games, this probably isn't for you. Though there is a mode that allows you to fast forward through 12 tasks each day. But that takes away from the tension that builds as you wait to see the results of your tasks. This is a challenging game that can take a lot of attempts to figure out. You need to consider and plan well to succeed. Take the time to develop your skills before rushing out to take on the Alaskan wilderness. Great game at a great price."
,Not Recommended,485820,28726418,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Player,"Survival point & click adventure with some potential but wrong execution.This game is recommended only for those who want to play a game in ""real time"" mode meaning one gaming day = one real day. Some tasks requires really 30 minutes, some even more. Devs stated this game has a year of play time and is meant to be played a little bit each day.And here comes the main reason this game cannot be generally recommended for survival games lovers. The casual mode included makes those 30 min tasks instant, anyway, you cannot proceed to another day in game until a new day in real life begin. If the casual mode could be played separately of the real days, the game would be highly recommended even containing some bugs and some weird control elements.Pos:- there is a lot of things to do - drinking, cooking, cutting tree into firewood and kindles, loading your guns manually, reading books etc.- it is kind of sophisticated. For example using a radio drains battery, you may charge the battery a little bit by hand charger, building wind turbine, solar panel or simply buy a new battery.- from content point of view it is kind of nicely made game, not sloppy.Neg:- casual mode is not a casual mode even though it penalizes you for being casual :/- some control mechanics are awful, for example during reloading, after inserting each single projectile into magazine the window ""reloads"" - hides and shows again.- from coding point of view the game feels kind of sloppy."

You have to know what you're getting into. Understand that there is no live action fighting in this game. You move around a character icon and click on all the different tools and options. You have many choices for things to do and ways to survive.This game requires a lot of patience. Every time you make a choice to do something, say maybe clean one of your guns for example, it sets a timer that references your computer clock and applies an appropriate wait time until the task is complete. During that time, you must wait for the task to be completed before you can do anything else in the game other than wait or log out and come back later.What I really like about this game is that it is a challeng, but it doesnt require my full attention. I can play while I cook or fold laundry or watch t.v. and the game will always wait for me (except at midnight, when all of your current condition stats will apply to your health - this is the only time you can die!) I usually log into this game two or three times per day for a few minutes to make choices. Then, I get to return later in the day and find out the results of my choice, whether or not I'm likely to survive until tomorrow. Good times."

The interface does need some work, but the makings of a fantastic game are there.  I exchanged emails with the game's creator and I can assure you, its not a cash grab.  They seem very genuine and want to make this game the best possible.  If you have issues, let them know in a constructive way.  I am sure they would appreciate the feedback.  I visited their blog, and they actually ""live the life"" so to speak.  They have real experiences in dealing with the elements, camping, fishing, etc.  From what was said in our emails. this was a first attempt at coding, and I think knowing that, it gives perspective to what a little support could do for an independent developer.

However, I have some issues with it from a player's point of view. Not being computer savy and a bit of an older person it was difficult to navigate the game mechanics and figure out how to actually play effectively. The most frustrating part of this game are the constant darkness,the injuries and wild animal attacks that occur. In ""real"" life those would of course happen but definately not at the rate which this game enjoins. Secondly, the ""time"" factor for game play is set to a real life pace and this in and of itself is rather disturbing because I only have a very limited time to play having to work a ""real"" life job, sleep and take care of my own personal business. Therefore after playing it for about 14 days....using up all my ""fast forwards"", experiencing many injuries, wild animal attacks and basically running out of food and cash I am taking a extended break from this game. Not sure if I shall play it again in the future. I got my $10.00 worth of play and am happy with that. If the game mechanics stay the same and do not address the issues I have delineated above most likely I will not come back nor recommend this game to my many gaming friends. Thank you game developers for what you have done so far with this game. It was a stellar effort and I am sure writing the code was a challenge. Good luck to you in the future."

The only thing some people may not like it would be due to it is ""Real Time"", but you can get some ""Fast Forward"" which allow you to jump ahead in time a few times a day.  Something you have to remember is the fact a ""Game Day"" is the same as in RL.  At Midnight the game processes the day and you start the next day.  I find myself doing chores and hate waiting till I can finish and start another one.  Now this game has a lot of ""Luck"" needed to stay a live.  But would I recommend this game?  Well if you like games that you have to really take time to play then this may fit your bill.  Great way to pass time each day as you go from one chore to another.  This is now my ""Go To"" game and I really like that the Dev of the game is very active on the discussion forums and will look at all suggestions we give.  Just remember this is a VERY SLOW paced game, and if you aren't careful you may just be attacked by a bear so be sure to keep your pistol loaded..  (Took me a few games to figure this one out!)

If you're like me and can only play at night, or can only spend an hour or two on it, you're going to get frustrated real quick.I knew it was real time, but I assumed that meant waiting X amount of minutes before X task was up. I didn't realize that meant it would be dark in game from my reallife 5 PM to 4 AM. Since I work until 5 every day, that means I essentially can't play this game at all. To be able to advance at all you need to do things that you can only do during the day.I've been drooling over this game for quite some time. I only played a short amount of time so far, since I could do very little in game (it was too dark), but it seems well put together, and it does make you anxious about planning what to do next (Hurry! I want to do X next! or :O A wolf!!? That's just what I need while I'm starving and searching for berries!) I wanted a survival game that puts you in realistic shoes and forces you to go farther than just surface worries and a point and click. I wanted something that would be educational and mentally stimulating. It is.I *don't* like the real time aspect of it. Chances are I won't be able to play this at ALL with my schedule. And a minor annoyance is that when you're 'writing' in the journal, you can't speed up the typing by clicking. I read really fast and it's kindof annoying that it goes so slow.

At the time of writing this review I'm well off and ready to survive the winter in all it's glory and peril. Thus I'll be starting anew right now in a harsher conditions (it's Fall/Autumn right now) and maybe as a fisherman.On the plus side, the game is constantly in developement and new content and fixes are appearing.

And it's not the cool ""realtime"" aspect to the game. I figured I would give it a try regardless of the reviews, because surely someone who has been playing video games for 30 years could stumble through it right?The 1st reason is the UI, while attempting to be unique and clever, is actually near impossible to comprehend. It could have worked, but there's one fatal flaw with the design: no mouseovers. That's right. Every menu is different, and you have no idea what any of the clickable items do. Naturally you want to hover over things to see what it does. Sorry. When setting up a game you could potentially play for a real life year, there is no clear definition of the parameters you are setting. So clicking around is your only option, and sometimes you can't unclick things. Its a catch 22.Oh, and the fonts. They are so difficult to read. Look at the screen caps. Could you stare at that for how long? Sometimes there is Red on Red and Green on Green, it's impossible to read and is hard on your eyes. There was a 'important' message that they highlighted in red on a dark brownish red background in the beginning of the game, which I couldn't even read.The 2nd reason is, this game is being sold as a full release on the steam store. In the steam store description it says it's a simulation (dev's own words). You start up the game and there is a disclaimer saying this is ""a proof of concept"" and stepping stone for further professional releases.  It even mentions that the game is NOT a simulation there. But it says the game is 'complete'. Well what complete game doesn't even have a quit button on the title menu, or ESC option? It's just not really what I expected from release level work. If this were sold as early access, then okay that's fair.TL:DRIt's like no one playtested it that didn't already know how the game was supposed to work. The UI is so frustrating, it ruins the experience that could have been amazing and therefore unplayble for me.UPDATE: devs are responding to complaints and have promised to improve the UI and also attempt to make the game full screen as well. Fingers crossed, I may pick it back up on sale someday if that happens."

The concept is great, and it tries to give you a taste of what it would be to live in the wild day by day. No zombies, no aliens, no looters.... just you and nature. So, when you start the game,you can choose where to build your cabin and this is important 'cause you have to choose wisely depending on what you want to do: do you want to be a lumberjack? build it close to trees. Prefer to be a prospector? Close to a river would be a nice spot. You can also try to find a srtategic place who gives you the chance to do more than a thing...then you pick up some supplies and the adventure beigns! From now on you are completly on your own...no handhold, you have to try to survive alone and make your own experience; luckly your cabin is plenty of books and magazines about how to survive to read...I also like the idea of ""write your story"" on your diary so as you can expect grapich is obviously minimal and essential as i could expect from a indie team by 2 people at their first attempt; said so, it does its work good enough to me, but it really need to be improved, as it appears not totally clear and a bit messy. Adding more tooltips to help people understand ""what does what"" would be great i think.  The great complain about this game is probably the need to wait real time to complete an in game task, but developers have recently added an option to speed up the current task (up to 12 tasks a day) so if you want a different peace and you want to istantly complete your job now you can do it; said so i think you miss a great part of the game, that actually is to wait real time. I know it can sounds weird but this is the way developers intended the game and with the specific purpose to try to give a even more realist feeling about the game and it works nice to me even if it sadly has a down side: how can i manage my game day while i'm at work? Here it comes another improvement idea: maybe adding a schedule where you can plan your day activity would be nice... and that's why i say THIS GAME WOULD BE BETTER ON A SMARTPHONE, 'cause you can always find 5 mins to check your activities on your mobile phone no matter where you are, but it became very much harder if you have to turn on your PC...even if i'm at home, i just can't turn on my PC for just few mins to check my cabin day and run another task... This acutally what i see in this game, i will update this review later as the game goes.I finally give a thumb up to this game for it's great potential and for being non conventional...i hope developers continue to improve and polish it. Also adding a way to regulate sounds would be nice.Btw, would be really nice TO HAVE THIS FOR SMARTPHONE!"

Also, I have issues with having to choose between a pack wiht a warm coat (I started playing in September - so I start out in September in the game - that means it's cold) or a pack with food.  The one leads to starvation, the other to hypothermia, meaning you're too cold to do anything at all anymore. Finding food you can't - you have no skills! Fishing? forget it. It's just real time wasted and another bout of hypothermia.II love the concept; I just got totally frustrated with the unrealistic happenings and the odds so totally stacked against me."
