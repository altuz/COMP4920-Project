Its more like a joke with 100 different possible punchlines.  Don't get me wrong, its worth what I paid for it.  For the record, I got it for 1.99 USD.  One play through takes maybe one or two minutes and is worth a chuckle or two.  Good if you only got a minute or so and just need a laugh. With different possible ""punchlines"" it can lift your spirits a few times.Don't buy if you want something serious or challenging though.  The story is pretty much A+(user choice)=X and literally is finished in about 1 or two minutes flat.  Replay multiple times to unlock multiple ""punchlines""."

There are frequent grammar errors. The game feels like it was written by a single person with little to no thought put into what would make the story better. It's not terrible, it's just not very well-thought-out."

I wasn't expecting anything quite that elaborate in terms of plot or character but Impossible Quest failed to keep my interest for even half an hour.  Most of the Choices lead to the termination of the game or a silly response that creates no story at all.  Stylistically, it is very simple which in itself would not have been an issue.  But its blatantly ugly and felt like something written and programmed by a pair of 9th graders.  I picked it up for less that $1 and didn't get my money's worth."

Chuck Norris is always awesome. Chuck Norris could win this game just by looking at the screen.

Most of the humor falls flat or is merely references, which aren't really funny just ""oh, hey. I understand that reference... cool...""In addition, there is a lot of repetition, as you have to go through the same beginning every time to get the different endings, and this game just feels like a waste of time to me"
,Recommended,485860,30382464,Posted: 7 March,all,Gamer,"This game is just like the Impossible Quiz with all the references, pop culture stuff, movie references, and some internet references as well. The Impossible Quest is a heavily multiple choice game where every choice you make leads to another outcome or scenerio within the game. I love the humor on this game as well and some of it was absolutely hilarious. This game at regular price isn't that expensive but definitely grab this game when it goes on sale! I think you might like this game unless you absolute hate playing multiple choice games but if not, then I highly recommend that you guys/ladies buy and play this game. You'll have a blast playing this game. I guarantee it!! :D"
76561198075673573,Recommended,485860,32466977,Posted: 16 June,all,wrygrass,"I rate the game Impossible Quest 2.5/5 (An almost okay game) yet despite this, I still recommend getting it because it is good for a few laughs and only costs 2 dollars. That's the price of 2 candybars and playing this game is at least as fun as eating two of those. Still, I'd recommend hedging your bets and buying this game when its on sale for 75% off or more, just in case you don't find it that funny.This game is essentially a simple parody of the genre of choose-your-own-adventure text-based story driven games like Champion of the Gods or Choice of Robots but features a significantly decreased word count. There are no pictures, only boxes containing text. True to the satirical style of this game, the writing is purposefully bad and the choices you get are mostly arbitrary and lead to largely arbitrary results.If it can be said that this game has any main goal it would have to be to unlock as many endings as possible. The endings are generally stupid and nonsensical, though a few endings make references to certain movies. There are 4 game modes based on different story genres but the game is persistently nonsensical regardless no matter which genre you play.Perhaps the biggest weaknesses of this game are that it tries too hard to be funny yet doesn't try hard enough to create a detailed satire. Once you play it a few times (which takes less than 20 minutes) the satire wears thin and the sense of humor becomes repetitive. Beyond earning a grand total of 5 possible steam achievements there seems to be little reward in continuing to unlock the game's endings.On the upside, I suppose this game's biggest strengths are its low cost and lack of bugs. The game's consistently poor grammar prevent if from being even remotely useful as some sort of twisted teaching aid for helping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adults learn how to read however. No, this game is good for a few short laughs and nothing more (unless of course you are somehow an adherent of Zen Buddhism and it is your desire to be randomly slapped down or rewarded for various random actions so as to gain greater insight into the unreality of the universe. Obviously, that's not me)."

,Recommended,485860,28231271,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,Wild Irish Rose 🌹🏰🌙,"First and foremost, I would like to state what a clever game this is.  This is a text game, but also a choose-your-own adventure of sorts.  You are given 3 choices each turn, some of them with no great effect on the next outcome.  However, the choices are more often than not just as amusing as the outcomes of them.  (There are even some gems in there for you sci-fi fans like myself...If you are one, you DEFINITELY should check this one out!! ;) . )  For you achievement hunters:Make sure to do all four quests first...There is one guide on the achievements, and this was the main advice I can share without spoiling anything more.There are some little tidbits and sprinkling of humor throughout the game that are sure to make everyone smile.  The writers have done a brilliant job, in my personal opinion, of tying things together nicely and keeping the reader interested.  This game is sure to give you the satisfaction of playing a short game, while entertaining you at the same time.  Big thumbs up for the not so ""Impossible Quest""!! :) :) :)"

It makes fun of itself, it has extremely clever humor. I am the type of person who hates spending too much money on anything, and I can honestly say that I think game is worth much, MUCH more than it costs. I would be content with purchasing this game for 5$, or even 10.[Slight spoilers, I only say that because I hate to deprive anyone of the experience] To elaborate on the clever humor, in one scenario you may end up on a laptop looking for a game to play, and if you select ""Impossible Quest"" it will send you to the title screen."

,Not Recommended,485860,27603731,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Lacie,"This is a simplistic text-based game. The game offers four different stories. Each story has various endings that you can unlock. I do like that the game has a setting to delete the save file, although I'm not sure how much of a replay value this game might have (unless someone else in your house would like to play the game).The biggest issue I had with the game is that there was quite a bit of grammatical errors. Some of the sentences needed a bit of work, not to mention some words were either misspelled or missing a letter. I didn't see many bugs in the game, but the one I did spot had me going through a loop. It would make the biggest difference if the devs double checked the entire game for errors!As is, this is another game I wish I could offer a maybe recommendation. The plus side is that there are achievements, which make this an easy game to gain them. The negative side is the grammatical errors in a text based game. If you can get this game on sale, and you don't mind the mistakes, then go for it. If the devs fix the mistakes, then this game would definitely be a yes recommendation."

This title was a pretty huge disappointment, to the point that I have major doubts about the validity of the positive reviews that pursuaded me to try it.The game shows a sentence on the screen, and you have as many as three possible responses to it. You click through the decision tree for a bit, then you reach an ""ending"", and you're dumped back at the start. Then you repeat the sequence, with a change to your last choice to check for an alternate ending, gradually traveling back through the decision tree. There's no indication of any kind of clever surprising game mechanic or paradigm shift, where the game suddenly opens into a bigger, different experience.It's not funny. The humor is trite: There's a large person next to you on a plane, haha? You go to use the plane bathroom and there's someone in there, haha?The screen layout is an unnecessary frustration: Reading (and clicking) text is the entirety of the game, but the text is all centered, which makes it feel unnecessarily clunky to read. A screen layout based on left-aligned text would have helped, at least somewhat. Or even better: shrink the sentence and choices to cover the top half the screen, and on the bottom half, show the decision tree you've uncovered so far. That, plus an intelligent warp/skip feature would take away the title's big negative, which is the realization that you're going to spend all your time repeating sequences over and over and over and over to check for alternate endings.After an entire 4 minutes, it was clear to me that this game is simply not up-to-par for Steam, even at a sale price. I'm requesting a refund -- a first for me."
