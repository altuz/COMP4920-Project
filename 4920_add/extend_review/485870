SDPP is a quick reaction game based on the beats of music. You can even loadin your own custom MP3 tracks if the function wasn't such bugged. You have to collect food from all 4 corners and flying bags from up and milkshakes from down until your stomach is completely filled. Then starts the famous poopthrowing again. Unfortunately you have to do it perfectly and there are also occuring bombs which kill you instantly. If you succeed and get the highest multiplicator you can earn gold medals. The flashgame is quite laggy and the milkshake clouds cover possible bombs coming up. Seems the community is already used to pooping games on Steam."

,Recommended,485870,24480534,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,koral06,"The main reason I'm giving this game a positive review is because of the low price. Otherwise, I would probably give it a neutral review. I will dive into that in a bit. Basically this is a fun game where you eat and poop! Your goal is to hit food with awesome fun music in the background, and then use that poop fuel to poop! I love the idea, the fun behind it, and the play. But there are a lot of cons that really need to be fixed before I can give it a solid positive review.Cons:The game is super laggy. I would like to say its my comptuer but this is a game that isn't high on graphics, and I've had less problems with higher quality games. Lagginess can cause you to lose a beat which is extremely frustrating.The point system doesn't make sense after awhile. I could get an absolutely perfect score and still get 3rd place. Doesn't make sense. It seems to be based on the fact of how much food they choose to give you during that song, and if you get a lot of bombs you can't utilize you get a lower score by chance. Also, wiping out all the people with your poop doesn't give you any kind of bonus other than the regular multiplier. I strongly suggest they implement a better scoring system.The music beat is off according ot hitting the food, which it mentioned it was supposed to be on beat. I used to play Elite Beat Agents on the DS that used beats to music and that was extremely fun. I wish they would more closely implement that idea. Also, I read you can upload your music but its so frustrating to do that it can be pointless.This last part isn't so much a con as a suggestion, after hardcore it would be nice to have an even more difficult level for greater replay value."

Starts out easy, then there's a little spike, and then you overcome it with experience. I've seen worse.Something disappointing seems to have happened with the Workshop feature. There are only the 5 ""official"" alternative characters provided by the devs at launch to choose from and that's it. I guess they were getting into legal trouble with the content users were submitting and decided it's not worth the hassle. Which is a bummer, but somewhat understandable.There are some issues, like the tutorial screens always appearing at certain times, which gets annoying when replaying early levels for top scores. The aiming camera is at an awkward angle and takes some getting used to. But overall, the game feels adequately polished and plays smooth and fun. A worthy successor toThere's Poop In My Soup, I can see KBros Games making a franchise out of poop. I'dbuykeep buying that for a dollar."

Kind of a lame, limited amount of scenarios in the included campaign but steam workshop integration to make up for it... As for the rest, its poop themed which is juvenile, but if you dont mind that you end up with a fairly well made casual twitch shooter. Its very casual, it has limited entertainment value that it earns from solid enough basic mechanics and a nice enough presentation.Could be improved with : gamepad support - local multiplayer - better song's beat recognition - and more granular control of the shooting arcs using KBMI would give this a careful recommendation given the extreme low price."

Super Duper Party Pooper is a follow up to There's Poop In My Soup only rather than crapping on people from above now you need to eat food with button presses in time to the music evading traps and build up enough poo to then launch at people who are dancing at the end.Messy fun for all!
