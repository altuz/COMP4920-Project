Classy. If you don't mind spending $3 on a short experience, you'll need this.Dollar for dollar, it's worth more than The Blu's whale.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=904395315"

After my second playthrough I went back to playing Blarp! :)Cabbibo does it again. To anybody complaining about paying for this, the developer deserves it and much for contributing to VR in a fascinating way. I will continue purchasing Cabbibo releases blindly!"

I have tried a variety of VR content, and this felt fresh and exciting in the same way as when I first started."

The same guy that brought us BLARP and WhiskersBox (Google it!) does it again with this pseudo-primitive, ultra-technological landscape. There's really no other way to explain it. You have to try it. Well worth the low price of admission if you're into things that push boundaries and experiment with the medium of virtual reality."

No leaderboard or goal, not really a game, but a surprising and innovative space to discover and play with alien geometries and substances. I've played through about 4 or 5 times (takes about 6-8 minutes to loop, depending on how much you fiddle), and I'm pretty sure I haven't discovered all the permutations yet.A great experience to show your friends what VR can be, or just to kill some time in an alternate dimension of feelings and sounds."
,Recommended,485880,23688935,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,Hiei,"**** REVIEW ****LUNE is an interesting experience, and very short might I add.This experience had me smiling and almost in a tranced state of mind during a majority of this title.I would have to say for those of you looking for a Game, this is not for you. For people looking for unqiue experiences along the early VR adapted Highway, this title is something unique to add to your arsenal. Some may argue the price is high for the experience you recieve, but it is about the same price as an Energy Drink or some other form of caffinated beverage.Lune is interesting, simple and unique. I would reccomend this title for a first time VR user.Enjoy!"

At times I even got that tingle from days of old. Also something that will show off your Vive to newbies in a way they can quickly get. At this price it's a must buy."

,Recommended,485880,23709474,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,Zizi Thrush,"people who think VR is only a natural evolution of the current state of video games: you may want to avoid this. It's not high gameplay or anything.people who want weird content that shows creativity and want to support creators who can elevate the ""genre"" of VR content to either a higher art form or at least make it a more whimsical platform,Lune is well worth the 3 dollars, if only to have a spot that recreates what I longed for in the halcyon days of my psychedelic usage: a kickass shimmery tent surrounded by the whirrs and chitters of the extraplanar old gods sewn together with a musical thread."

Bought it again and gifted it to a friend immediately.Afterwards i went to the developers website, and explored it all the way to 4 am in the morning. Then went to sleep and had some very powerful dreams.This experience unfortunetly isn't for everyone. For the ones that don't understand it, it will simply be meh to them. For the ones that do understand, it can bring those individuals to tears."

Still I've enjoyed my time with it and I look forward to trying it again and showing it to others. I'm still not sure if I went through the whole experience or not, things started breaking and I had thrown pieces outside of my environment, which seemed to keep me from being able to continue or loop back to the begining if that is what would have happened next."
,Recommended,485880,23739995,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Blänk,The kind of thing that just speaks for itself. You try it and love it and feel happy that you were able to do it! I might have even paid a few more dollars for this....it was really neat watching my 10 year old son play this before me and explore it on his own. I had an equal amount of fun when it was my turn!

,Recommended,485880,28256484,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,lil buddy,"This texture and flow of LUNE is so incredible. It feels unlike any other game I've played, or more importantly, any other experience I've had. Everything is soft and glowing and light and fuzzy. I showed it to an installation artist friend of mine and he was equally fascinated. It's very short but I'm already feeling the urge to replay it. I hope the VR market can accomodate more experiences like this."
