The CSGO joke was kinda cuteYou're not as clever as you think you are Summer Sale. Do you know what we do with games that make us quit the game as part of a game mechanic *stares at superhot*? We stop playing them. It's not unique, it's aggravating. You need to earn that Summer Sale and you didn't earn that gimmick.It's not visually cohesive at all, yet they somehow still managed to use assets from other mini games they made in the same game (the bus, the character, etc)Have you noticed most of these are negatives yet? GoodIt somehow still managed to crash in a 40 minute experience.Just as a reminder, this costs real money.The hud style look was actually pretty nice looking, and the steam knock-off they designed is actually kinda nice looking. Reminds us of some click and point adventure games that allowed you to play on an arcade machine you found (or something similar)The games fall into three categories each with a variance of stupid. You have joke games, you have unfinishable games (they all fall into that category) and you have broken games. We'll let the reader figure out which type is worse.The game forgot the fact that jokes are funny because they have a reference point. Just saying ""30 Fps"" isn't funny.JUST AS A REMINDER, THIS COSTS REAL MONEYSide Note: This would have been funny if this was released in Early Access as part of the joke. Not saying they should have done that, just that it would have at least been remotely funny."

False advertising.Bought the game and ithas no executable inside(had to use Idle Master to write this). Fraud.Guess I'm not ready for a miracle ;(Edit: Actually, I found out why it has no executable.

,Not Recommended,485890,23341849,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Hausu,"Where do I even begin with this game. First off ive been playing this game for about 7 years now and every playthrough ive had of it was exellent. There is alot of variety when it comes to builds. There is the obvious Light/Dark or Grey option for the game but there is also Force user builds, Ranged builds, Pure combat focused guardian, etc. I find the combat to be enjoyable (In my opinion) since its tactical and you can really plan attacks and things of that sort. Take DA:0 for example. Its pretty much the same system. You can start with 3 beginning classes: Guardian (Combat focused), Sentinel (Better skill progression), and Consular (Force powers). You then later in the game get different set of prestige classes depending on your allignment. Now, lets get to the writing of the game. This game has one of the best stories I have ever seen. You'll see once you play it for yourself. The reason I prefer this game slightly over the first is just because I prefer the darker, philosophical, grey aspects of the atmosphere and story a bit better (Kotor 1 is also one of my favorite games). Anyways, this game presents the idea that Dark is not necessarily evil and Light isnt nessesary good and you really get to see the Flaws of both sides. For example, you play as the Jedi Exile, who was exiled from the Jedi order for rusing to war to protect innocents. The Jedi were lazy and waited to ""evaluate the threat"". The dialouge and voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic (Especially Kreia). For this game, you dont even need to be a fan of Star Wars. A non Star Wars fan would look at this game and just play an RPG. However a Star Wars fan would look at this and play an amazing Star Wars RPG. The reason for this is because the game is set in an era wayyy before the Movies. One flaw however, would be the cut content presented this game. Obsidian (The developers) were rushed to release this game by lucasarts, resulting in them needing to cut out content for the game. Luckily, a group of community modders managed to get into the games files and restore alot of the content that was cut. You can find the mod on the steam workshop. Anyways, hurry up and buy the game! You wont be dissapointed."

,Not Recommended,485890,24432078,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Tom,"Summer Sale, the words we all look forward to every year, oh how things have changed with this title though. This is an internet meme single player game, releasing in June 2016, being developed by Ductape Studio.The game play, if you can call it that, is basically a series of horrendous mini games, covered in internet memes and jokes that you will hate even more after playing this game. The aim of the game however is to buy all the games in the sale! You start off with $100 and you need roughly $300 to purchase everything. In order to make up the last $200 you play in three free to play games inside this game which generates coins for you, one of those mini games is a runner (hint! This is the only one worth playing), a space invaders style game, and a clicker...a clicker…. Once you have earned enough money to buy everything in the store, well, congratulations, you’ve finished.The game doesn’t have a graphical look, nor does the UI do it any favors either. Now I know this isn’t meant to be a serious game, but it’s on Steam which is a world wide store front!  But the menus in this game, oh god the menus. It is probably the worst UI I have ever come across, you have to see it to believe it.  The game’s sound effects and soundtrack are again, just pure awful; mute this game asap. Don’t put your ears through the torture.Summer Sale has no difficulty levels at all. You will be able to 100% this game in less than half an hour. Yes you heard it, you can finish everything there is to do in this game in less time than it takes me to go for a number two.Somehow a game this basic, this simple manages to have technical problems too. It takes over 30 seconds to even load the damn game. Even when installed on an SSD it makes no odds. Want to mute the music? Better restart the game. Want to change any option that matter? You better restart the game. Just no. it doesn’t even support 1080p.I’m sorry Steam Community, but is it just me who is getting sick to death of this absolutely awful games making it onto our beloved store front? This is a browser game at best. There is no way on god’s green earth that this game should be on Steam. It is daylight robbery to have this game cost 79p!  Do yourself a huge favor and never look at, never mind purchase this game. I’ve been through the pain for you.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

,Not Recommended,485890,23357014,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Persevere,"Summer Sale is a game developed around the idea of Steam's famed Summer Sale. The sole objective of the game being that you buy everything you can from the Steam Store at the cheapest prices. From the first look at the game, it appears filled with unfunny jokes, memes and other pointless things that were funny 2-3 years ago.Upon loading the game, you're met with a 3 options. Play, Settings and Exit. Having looked into the settings menu, you're able to change a lot of settings to suit your personal needs right down to the colours it displays on the screen. This is a great addition but I feel there should be a colour blind mode for those with poor sight.Once you're finally into the game, you're given $30 to buy as much content as you can from the Steam Store before you need to play the Mini Games to amass an amount of coins to buy the rest. This is where the game falls flat for me personally. The mini game choices you have to choose between are; Dragon Erol, a game which doesn't actually work nor does it allow you to collect coins with much ease; Glorious Cannon which premises you of essentially defending some black squares with meme names. It's also the easiest to get coins on if you do not own an auto clicker; Finally we have Coin Train which will delight the players who enjoy using an auto clicker. There really isn't much choice between the games and after a while, you'll get bored rather quickly. It doesn't help matters when you need $150 roughly to complete the game.The positive side of the game is that isn't expensive. It's currently just 79p on the Steam Store and comes with 6 rather quick and easy achievements which offers you around 90 minutes of gameplay. If you're just after the quick completion, this game will fill your needs but ultimately it's another Indie game that shouldn't of passed Steam Quality Control."

I know I only have 0.1 hours, but that is enough to tell me how bad this game is. This game has no point, I was expecting a summer sale tycoon where you maybe buy games for very cheap, maybe earn some money off of cards or something along those lines, but it's nothing like that.Here is how the game goes:You start the game up and you are put in a tiny version of normal steam. You can scroll down to a list of about 30-40 games. It gave me one good laugh, seeing all the names for the games. I bought a game on there, I go to my library to play it, and it's not even a minigame. It just puts you in a world as a character that you get put in as for every other game, and it is just some lame gag. For example, the How to Die game just puts you in between 2 zombies, and one comes to you within 3 seconds and you just die and reset to the exact same thing. It has no purpose.This is one of the worst games I have ever come across, even for its price. It claims I can experience the Summer Sale without losing money, yet I lost a dollar to experience sh*t."

But the only upside is that you don't need to spend literally hours getting the achievements for this game, and after max 75 excruciating minutes of being in-game and grinding the money for the 'games' in this, you'll finally be done with all achievements, and can finally close down the game and uninstall it and never look back again.This 'game' isn't even a game, it's a torture device that should be mandatory for sentenced prisoners to play for 24/7, over and over, and over, and eventually everybody will break down.So avoid this 'game' at all costs, it's not even worth the 0.99 cents I paid for it."

,Not Recommended,485890,23357475,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Devin,"After hearing about this game I had to see for myself what all the hype/disappointment was about so I bought my copy. For 99 cents how could you go wrong? I attempted to boot up the game and was met at a weird screen that looked like the game was far away. I attempted to restart the game and it still had the game far away. After tons of troubleshooting I looked to my right and saw that my Vive's display was on. The game has Vive support. After unplugging my Vive the game booted up normally. Anyway, moving onto the pros/cons of ""Summer Sale"".ProsIt's 99 cents.Humorous takes on the Steam Summer Sale and popular titles.Jabs at Windows updates, jokes about downloading RAM/deleting Sys32, etc.Somewhat interesting minigames when ""buy"" titles.ConsOld jokes that are stale.Some of the minigames are broken. Such as the teleporting game.The game itself is glitchy. It deleted my save progress and I had to start over again.No replay value. Once you get a nice laugh from some of the reference and get all the achievements you'll never boot it again.So in conclusion I'm going to have to say that I don't recommend this game to people that are looking for a serious title that they'd like to spend more than 30 minutes in tops. This is a parody game and as such doesn't have a high replay value. I'm not however going to ask for a refund as I think I've gotten 99 cents worth of laughter for the game and the trading cards are just going to ""lessen"" the blow of the game's price. All in all if you like ""meme"" humor, playing a semi decent simulator, and have 99 cents to blow then go for it."

After waiting a rediculous amount of time for it to load, it proceeds to be a resource hog using a constant ~33% processor usage and over 500MB of video memory, taking you to a barely functional lookalike of the steam store page. As you don't have enough money, you're forced to play one of 3 minigames, an infinite runner, some shooting thing, and a button you can click for fractions of a cent. As the shooting thing is jumpy and difficult to play and you'd break your mouse before getting anywhere with the click one, you're basically stuck with the infinite runner. Getting enough funds takes like 20 minutes of the infinite runner where you have to tap space to jump over green blobs which aren't immediatly obvious to even be obsticles, as they look like the rest of the bland scenery, and your character's hitbox extends an entire character width too far to the right making it so when you hit the green blobs and end the game you might not even realize at first that's what happened. Your character also sinks into the ground as the game goes on. The backround music sounds at first to be about a 3 second loop, but it does change up to a slightly different 3 second loop every once in a while but is still horrible. As you play the game also shows you fake ads in the bottom right corner which obscure your ability to see what's coming at you, but you have avoid closing them as if you close to many it brings you to the ""door 10"" update screen which you have to sit at for a few minutes while it slowly counts up, and which also has the side effects of breaking the store so you can't buy more stuff until you restart the game and corrupting your save so when you do restart you end up with no cash and no games, so you're actually better off deleteing your save file and starting from the begining than continuing from there."

In Valve's Summer Sale game, most of the minigames are a lot more fun and entertaining as they vary from a variety of genres, and have a lot of great storylines, gameplay mechanics, and much more. Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game is mostly joke simulator minigames with terrible gameplay and missable achievements. The options menu in Valve's Summer Sale game is a lot simpler as it only changes the important parts of the game like graphics, button mapping, etc. whereas Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game literally has too many unnecessary options like changing the text, coin color, and other weird changes. The only thing that is good about Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game is that you don't need a high end PC to play the minigames, Valve's Summer Sale game varies on system requirements and may require a top notch computer to run the minigames properly. The emoticons and profile backgrounds on Ductape Studio's Summer Sale game is a lot better than Valve's Summer Sale game because it pretty much expresses the whole sale in general whereas Valve's Summer Sale game is mostly theme based. Overall though, you shouldn't buy this game if you focus more on the gameplay, unless you want another steam badge then go for it.Rating: 1/100 It belongs in the trash"

For a dollar. Like, the price of one or two chocolate bars.If seeing a short comedy (let's just call it that) is worth a dollar for you, and it's OK that you'll probably never launch it again, then I wouldn't see a reason why you shouldn't try it. I personally enjoyed it.However, if this is not your kind of humor (which you should be able to tell from the trailer), or if you basically hate everything that is sold on Steam and doesn't fit TotalBiscuit's definifion of a game (as most reviewers seem to see things here), then obviously, buy two bars of chocolate and forget Summer Sale.P.S. seeing these ""funny"" negative reviews is actually kinda sad. I've just read the other day how Nathalie Lawhead and other indies are turning away from Steam because of the unwelcoming community, and ""seek refuge"" on other storefronts for a more open audience. Now I kinda see what she meant by that."

Also if you're trying to earn all the achievements, first off grind out $140+, then buy a single game, then buy 5 games, then buy 15, then buy them all.
