,Recommended,485900,31333125,Posted: 23 April,all,H8ff0000,"I do IT professionally for a living, and I've been building my own computers since I was a kid, so when this game appeared on Steam I instantly took a shine to it. The developer is a great guy who is building this game by himself, yet he manages to put out updates all the time, with both content and bug fixes. He listens to feedback, and often will add features we request into the game soon after we ask. Same goes for any fixes we think could be made; if he becomes aware of something that needs fixing, don't expect it to be broken for long. He has a clear path for improving the game and adding content, with no slowdown in sight. True, it could use more content. But this is a unique little gem that doesn't break the bank. I am happy to have been able to purchase this and help support a truly helpful, caring developer."

I especially enjoy the simple graphics while at the same time the amount of detail; you did a great job and I'm looking forward to the complete product.The tutorial really needs to be expanded for people who have no idea how to troubleshoot computers as well as how to do that. It's not a lot of fun to flounder around without knowing how to get something done.
,Recommended,485900,33612349,Posted: 17 July,all,Hemmingjay,"I have supported this game since it's launch weekend. It continues to feature regular updates which include bug fixes, content additions and tweaks to gameplay as requested by the community. The updates are small but regular. The workshop features roughly 20x additional content for the game but it's fun enough without it.I would guess the game will come out of early access by or near 01 2018 but I am confident that we will still see some minor tweaks after that. With all small indie projects, the success of the game relies on the support we, the gamers, provide along the way. Negative reviews that fail to account for the development process and such will only stunt the ability of the studio to make a great game. This is a great game and a wonderful developer. Buy it, play it, support it with good reviews and spreading the good word."

How ever the game has some bugs and glitches but most of them are patched soon after their found this is one of the great indie devs that are there to make something the most enjoyable for everyone.The game it self currently is quite repeatitive but attempts to mix it, Some of the quests it gives you are sometimes quite complex and sometimes don't define what they want exactly leading you to question and guess what they want but for the most part they usually give hints out to what's wrong or what ever, when handing in a quest they give a quick checklist of everything that's good and if anything is wrong or not done yet will apear making it easier to the player this option could be removed in the more harder diffucuity that hasn't been added yet and still is in the works (quite exicited for it)Anyways this game is a good time passer and should be watched for the end stage of this game."

,Recommended,485900,25081654,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,Zyraph Chronicros,"First, I very rarely make a review on a game. I only make reviews when I feel they are justified.Second, this review is not final. I will update it after certain milestones that I feel warrant an update to this review.I completed just one day in the game, and while I got stuck a couple times on figuring things out, i did manage to get through it (one particular thing left me with a question in the forums, but the issue was just my own error).This game scratches an itch I've been begging to have scratched for a very long time, and also is something I've dreamed of doing for even longer. I have always wanted to run my own IT shop, and I'm very happy with this game even as I've seen it so far.The GUI is pretty flexible in the main game, and you are able to drag around the different screens that pop up (Inventory, Tips, Computer Parts, etc.) all can be moved anywhere on the screen. Each part you buy has various features, but not many seem to indicate much as far as an actual mechanic.There are shelves on which you can display excess inventory, which is very useful since 25 slots may not be enough later in the game. However, if you are wanting to repair someone's computer with a part you already have on display (not on the Inventory shelves), you must take it out of the showcase, move it to Inventory, and then drag it on the part you are replacing. This makes it kinda a pain since there's an extra step involved in fixing a computer you are tasked to repair, and also makes for a hard time of keeping track of your inventory and cutting out any wasteful spending (by accidentally buying another part for someone you already had).Some of the dialog the customers give you do give clues about what may be wrong with their computer, which is invaluable for troubleshooting. For example, ""It seems like my power button is broken"" could indicate a problem with the Power Supply. I really love this touch to the game, as it adds depth and helps make diagnosing a computer a lot quicker than just scanning and investigating each and every component. However, some dialog can be confused with what someone could be asking. ""I need a Milky Way SE-WG to save my day"" could be inferred that they want a whole working computer with that particular case, when the reality is they just want the case and nothing else. This one in particular tripped me up enough to make a post in the forums about it, since my IT background makes me think most people want a functioning computer and not just one part.Computer assembly is beautiful, from connecting cables, to spreading thermal paste, to adding a heatsink. However, if you don't know what is being asked of you while doing it, it can be a bit complicated, and immersion-breaking. This reason alone is why I do wish it launched with a tutorial, but it's not game-breaking, so I can excuse this minor hiccup.Some missions involve selling a part you already have (if it's in your inventory or display showcases). If you have it already, all you have to do is accept it and you make a small profit for already having what they wanted. This makes having full display showcases very nice, since you don't have to do extra clicking just to get what they want. However, you have limited space to hold things, and if your inventory and showcases are full, you cannot troubleshoot computers since the parts that are damaged need somewhere to go. This is realistic balancing, and definitely helps with immersion, since just having everything you want and can buy would definitely be game-breaking.Overall, I am very pleased with this game, but I do have a few complaints that I hope will be addressed in future builds. For one, the hours your shop are open are from 6 AM to 8 PM (06:00-20:00). This would be fine, however your shop will go from 19:59-06:00 for the next day. No break in sequence saying ""Hey it's the next day"" or anything. You don't even leave the shop. I am very passionate about computers, but even I need to leave work to eat or sleep or something. A better way of ending the day would be a Daily Sales Report, or End of Business Day Report. Basically a listing of things that says ""Here's how much you have sold of each of these items categorized by type of item, and how much you spent to acquire items and what was sold due to damage"" or something like that. Such a listing would be invaluable to not only gauge what customers are needing for repairs, but also a way to figure out the current trends of your customers. You could stock up on certain things that you always replace, or be prepared when a bunch of people want more hard drives suddenly.Another fun idea would be a recycling program. I mentioned this in the forums, but I'll mention it here as well. When you get a damaged part, you tend to sell it back to the supplier for a little money back. Another way to go about this would be, someone brings in a computer (or part or whatever) and they ask if you would buy it off them for x amount, to do whatever you can even if it means scrapping it. You do so, and either the part is still good (you can keep it back to put into another computer) or bad (sell it back to the supplier). It would be a risk in buying it, but it could still pay off in getting a part for a fraction of the supplier's price. Of course, if it is a dud, it would cost you more than you could scrap it for.Overall, this game has a lot of potential, and I know a lot of people who would probably love and support this game. I'll have to make sure they hear about it, since I really want this game to be awesome! Right now, it's just a break-fix shop. In the future, it could evolve in many ways, and I really want to watch this happen!"

Feels more like running a pickup-pooint than a shop- Cumbersome interface- Poor language- Some things should be explained to the player, rather than having them find out – When I received my first delivery, it took me a good couple of minutes to figure out why the items weren't in my inventory;. Turns out they were in a little box, blending in with the colour of the floor, in the back of the shop.

For example I would like to see people come in with different problems other than ""my computer doesn't work, find out what's wrong and fix it."" Maybe you could have people wanting to upgrade their PC for example. I can tell that the developer has plans for future updates as there are certain things in the game right now that don't really do anything, such as the specs of the components (which I'm sure there is a lot to be done with this), and people's reactions to the condition of their PC as right now there are meters that essentially make it so you have to give back their PC or better or they won't take it. Still lots of fun to play around with, but I think I've seen everything that this game has to offer in it's current form, although as it recieves updates, I will update this review.Bugs that I ran into:- turned on mouse edge collision (or whatever the menu calls it) while on windowed mode and my mouse got stuck outside the window and I had to delete my config.bin file to fix it (this would have been a game breaking bug had I not figured out a way to fix it for myself.- Clicking and dragging items is frustrating as you have to drag up before you can drag to the side or it won't register that you want to drag the item.- Dragging things into their sockets on the computer is hit or miss, and RAM is particularily finicky.- The game makes you use way too much thermal paste- There is no real reason to ever not be paused in the game other than when inspecting items waiting for customers, I would maybe like to see the pause feature taken out and then maybe just reduce the frequency that customer come in.- Used HDD's and other broken (burned) parts can sell for >$20 in this game for some reasonThings I would like to see in future updates:- More parts! I love the 3D models of each part that exist, and more would always make the game better.- More scenarios to deal with (like I said above, more than just replacing parts, for example, upgrading PCs, building PCs to order for customers from scratch, etc)- Better UI (more readable text, higher poly sprites for character as well as the shop- Upgraedable shopConclusion: If you have a passion for computer hardware like I do, then you will probably love this game, but keep in mind that it is at a very early stage in development and you are buying an incomplete product.

,Recommended,485900,30327798,Posted: 4 March,all,mojito,UI is so terrible that even after reading the rubbish tutorial i still don't know how to do stuff.I mean i can do these missions in real life it's not that hard but i cannot for the life of me figure out how to unplug an hdd in this gameEDIT: The dev is so willing to help that he added me on steam to private message me asking me how it could be improved. That's the kind of dedication i really approve of.
,Recommended,485900,28877249,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,s0ra,"Interesting concept and fairly well executed. Always thought about the idea of an IT business simulation and Hardware Engineers pulls it off. So why the thumbs down?Content is somewhat lacking at this stage and you can do and see all there is in a couple hours of gametime. However, with a great framework already put down, there are a ton of ideas floating around about what can still be added. I would recommend this. Sure, some content is lacking (based on your views to an extent), but the developer is active and cares about his followers. Looking forward to seeing how this turns out."
