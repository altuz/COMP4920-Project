Can't adjust audio ingame.- Outlines of the towers doesnt match with the lines of the enemy wave.- There was a weird thing going on with the targetting of the towers.- Camera is only from one point- To make things worse, the mouse sensitivity was through the roof and because the lack of an options/settings menu, you couldn't adjust that ingame!- Overlap of the text of the Cost of an upgrade and the upgrade button itself. Both were hardly readable."

This game is bad in every aspect.Controls are bad, unintuitive.UI is awful.Graphics are worse than in ZX Spectrum games.Music (?) - you just want to turn it off somehow.You can pick either English or Russian language, but when you play it in English - you get things like: ""Cooldown: 1.0 cek"" 10/10 translation.Seriously, why this game is on Steam? I dunno."

The graphics are ok if hastily done, but the animations are fairly glitchy, and the primary challenge I experienced in my admittedly brief go at this game came from not being able to figure out how my tower AI was choosing its targets. It could also use better translation, but it's good enough to understand so I really don't count that as a problem per se."

,Not Recommended,485950,30265541,Posted: 1 March,all,scoota33,"This is the result of taking an online course at udemy which teaches you how to build a BASIC tower defence game, and that is exactly what this game is; BASIC. What makes it so hardcore then? the towers just pick a target and shoot at it, there is no targeting options so you can watch the closest enemy to the end just run straight past your towers because they chose to shoot someone else. Its a good thing i only paid 30c for this, thanks to a 90% off voucher, i'll try and recover what i can from the trading cards and count my losses"

,Recommended,485950,28732434,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Josh,"I bought this game just so that I could express the current issue with trading cards. There are two cards by the name of ""Tower"", so when purchasing them, it is by pure luck that you could ever achieve 5 of each with only 10 card purchases. There needs to be a name change of one of these cards so that this is no longer an issue. As of now I have a level 3 badge, 2 of each kind of card with the exception of the tower cards. I have 3 of one of the tower cards and 0 of the other. I refuse to continue purchasing them hoping to get the remaining two, but if the badge is not completed the other cards purchased will be a waste. Please fix this issue developers, all you have to do is change the name of one of the cards.EDIT: Developers got back quickly and fixed the issue. 10/10 Thanks"

So I think I got my money's worth.If you fail a mission, you can restart the level and try a better approach. So even if it is unfair (well, so is life) you can cheat fate and win anyway ... after a few attempts.As tower defenses go, it's c**p, but almost for free, it' still worthwhile. If you can get it for a $ or less and if you like tower defense, go for it."
