But keep in mind this game is Deathmatch only (as the time of this review) and is as arcade as the old machine. Also I seem to not find anyone else playing on multiplayer, don't know if there is no one else playing (which is criminal, this game is great and cheap) or it is my connection (ports maybe?). But still you can have plenty of fun on the single player where you can select enemies and allies and its numbers, then go blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up on one of 6 maps (as the time of this review).Talking about maps, this game received a huge update last week which added a lot of content, when I bought it some months ago it had only two factions, being Japan with 2 tanks and Soviets with 4, now it has added 3 more factions, USA, Germany and UK. Aswell adding new tanks to everybody, including World War II tanks (Just look at the update notes on announcements to see what it added, it is a lot of tanks) aswell two more maps.Also it is worth noting that the dev is really quick to reply to any bug report and extremelly quick to fix it, such professionalism should more than being praised, while other devs take a long time or even ignore problems, the guy behind the game really cares about user experience, this alone should already made the game more than worth."

Tokyo Warfare was a game I've always been hoping for since the Tokyo Wars arcade booths were decommissioned.  Though the Original Soundtrack doesn't live up to the standards Tokyo Wars set, the game play is still the same and it's great.  The simple and fast paced game play really is what makes this game great.  There are no complicated armor penetration values or angling of armor, 2 Factions, 2 MBT's, 1 Game Mode.  This may put off some, but sometimes simple is for the better.As for bugs and glitches, there are a few minor camera clipping issues and sometimes you respawn on top of another tank, but nothing game breaking or big enough for it to matter.I also hope to have full Japanese voicing for menus and in-game implemented soon, as the English voices sound rather cheap and as a native speaker it really is unbearable.I maybe bias because of the nostalgia I feel from playing Tokyo Warfare, but the game is fun, and I recommend it for anyone who wants a game they can play for very short amounts and still have fun."

TANKS AND ANIME!I quickly downloaded it and began playing it. At first I was kinda confused about the controls and it took me some time to get used to it. A tutorial would be great for first time players.  It is very fast paced and the gamplay mechanics are for the most part playable. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT! IF YOU WANT A POLISHED GAME RIGHT OF THE BAT GO SOMEWHERE ELSE INSTEAD OF TROLLING THE DEVELOPERS.Even though there are issues with optimization its still enjoyable. From the three maps there are multiple things that can be destoyed such as cars and buildings. There are two factions for now, which are called the Japanese Self Defenses Forces that has the Type 10 Hitomaru Shiki Sensha tank. Then there is the Red Star(Soviet or Russian forces) which appears to be a modified T-72 or a T-80. Certain compartments of the tank can be knocked out or damaged. I believe the tracks the turret and the cannon are the only things so far that can be incapacitated.I love the style of the regular anime and then manga settings. The music is a bit load but eh its kinda fun. contols are a bit fast and wonky. Its really sensative. There are FPS drops and clipping problems but thats to be expected for now. There should be more effects in my opionion like micheal bay movie effects but thats just me.While there is a small amount of content right now I believe that there is more to come. It is worth that money if you want to see this game blossom and become a hit. Yes there should be more tanks, factions, maps and optimizations but be patient. THIS GAME HAS GREAT POTENTIAL. I Love it and I hope you do as well. Thanks for your time."

,Not Recommended,486510,28118331,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,sнɔʀᴊɔк,"Firstly, a few things:-The controls really are not very hard to get used to at all, especially if you're used to tank games. Took me about 10 minutes max. WASD for movement, mouse for aiming. Q changes the camera, whilst E selects the shell type.-The tanks take a lot longer to slow down than you might expect.-There are no armour angling or penetration mechanics, it is distinctly anarcadegame.PROS:-A good alternative for those of us who find there to be nowhere near enough tank games. More options are always good.- Clearly doesn't take itself too seriously, which is in line with the arcadey style. Lots of room to implement more arcade style features that other tank games would never consider.-A healthy selection in the options menu of filters and other graphical elements.-There's a vague presence ofanime girls.If that's your thing, then great, but they're not really present in any meaningful way other than some pictures on the faction selection screen and repetitive voice lines during battle.If they're not your thing, that's a con in and of itself, but you probably aren't going to choose this over World of Tanks or Armored Warfare anyway.EDIT: The icons can, apprently, be turned off along with the voice lines.CONS:-Tank selection is way too limited. As of now [as far as I know] there are only 6 tanks available to choose from-The JSDF only gets 2 of those.-Absolutely needs better optimisation, especially considering the simplistic artstyle. Doesn't run very well in general, and I can imagine poorly on lower end machines.-Not everything has been ironed out in regard to the core game mechanics. My tank has been stuck in the ground or a piece of rubble on occasion, and as of writing this, I've only played an hour. There is at least a self destruct button.-Despite it being an arcade game, some innacuracies show themselves and could make the game better if it were more realistic or nuanced. All the tanks seem to take the same short time to reload [about 2 to 3 seconds] and different reload times for each tank would add more variety.- There's no armour or penetration mechanics, all there really is are modules that can be damaged.-The maps, already limited as they are, are really not that big.-Huge bright enemy and teammate markers make sense in an arcade game,but it would be nice if they could be turned off.EDIT: They can!-The UI and infrastructure could use some work. The game overall is very basic, as I mentioned earlier, only 3 maps, 1 online gamemode nobody is playing, the main arcade mode [vs. bots] and a 'flycam' mode which is literally just bots vs. bots, and you just watch. Which leads me on to my next point...-The price tag. It's certainly not an expensive game, but for £11.00 I would expect more. Plenty of free games manage to put more free content in and at a higher quality. It's understandable considering the small team who made Tokyo Warfare, but all that really needs to be said is that you should either wait for a sale or for a new update, with more fixes and more content.As it stands, I can't recommend this game as it is currently. Not enough content to justify the price tag and a few other issues that mean it should be left until more updates come. It really is afungame that has plenty of untapped potential that I truly hope the devs keep working on. The world needs more tank games, but the world also needs a reason to choose this over the others."
76561198045234824,Recommended,486510,24604244,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,sascomander,"So I do recommend this game. But with that being said it does need work.The gameplay is interesting as it the game is based off and old Japanese arcade game called Tokyo wars. It is pretty different compared to the larger tank games ( World of tanks , Armored Warfare , Warthunder). It is faster paced than these games. I would sort of equate it to how Battlefields tanks play.So far there are 3 maps.Arena - This is a large blue square thats about it.Naniwa-ku - This is a city with lots of tall buildings and several overpasses. A lot of the landscape can be destroyed I am not sure if everything can be but I know some of the overpass can and some of the buildings.OI-Terminal - It is another city like landscape but closer to water with a large shipping area. Its a pretty large map with some destructable environments.Right now there is 2 factions to choose from each with 1 tank. A Japanese faction with a Type-10 MBT and I believe a Soviete faction with a T-80U.The second 2 maps, the red faction and online multiplayer are unlocked thru leveling up. Its fairly fast to unlock everything in the game so far. I think you can get everything by level 8 which is easily achieved in a few games.The game has controller support and plays pretty well with an Xbox One controller. It also has VR support. VR isnt really my thing but if you like that the game has it."

In other words if you are trying to firgure something out your preatty much on your own. (Would recomend some writen tutorials.)Being a World of tanks player, and someone who played warthunder... If you just want to derp around and have a good time, rather then being stressed out by the online world. Or would rather ONLY play with friends. This might do it for you.Keep in mind this game doesn't really have a armor system, so we are talking REALLY old school arcade. Not that there is anything wrong with that.

Its very arcadey so there is no need to worry about armor values and gun penetration, just point and shoot. All the vehicles are like racecars except for the Maus, but even that monstrosity is a speed demon by comparison to what it should be.Currently, the game features 5 nations and vehicles from both WWII and the modern era. At the start though, you will only have access to the USSR/Russia and Japan. It doesn't take long to unlock everything in the game, a couple hours at most, and the Karl Gerat is so worth it.Sadly, there aren't a whole lot of people playing online, but matches with friends are always a blast, and if you're sad and alone, don't worry, there are bots for you to take out your issues on.This game is absolutely worth it."

,Not Recommended,486510,24769992,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,何?!,"Tokyo Warfare is the spiritual successor to the 1996 arcade tank shooter called Tokyo Wars (I have never played Tokyo Wars btw). The objective of the game is to eliminate your opponent a certain amount of times to claim victory. You have the option to play as the Japan Defense Forces or the Red Star.The gameplay is fast and the tanks move well for the most part. You have the option to fire either armor piercing rounds, explosive rounds, or a machine gun. During gameplay, you have two health bars: turret armor and chassis armor. Getting either one of these damaged can cause some negative side effects such as your tank having a slower fire rate because the barrel is damaged or even having your tank completely immobilized because the tracks are completely ruined.As of now the game has only three maps: Arena, Naniwa-Ku, and Oi Terminal. Arena seems to be a map that tests how well each player can maneuver since there is virtually no cover, Naniwa-Ku seems to be a map based on close quarter battles with its small streets and super tight alley ways, and Oi Terminal seems to be a mix of close and long range battles with the main area being a container yard with lots of cover to go by as well as corners to turn.Well after mentioning all of this, I think it is safe to address the many faults of Tokyo Warfare.First of all, Tokyo Warfare has no kind of in game tutorial. This could lead some players to be completely confused as to how to play the game or even how the game works overall. You are able to download the manual for the game but that makes me wonder why they couldn't just add the manual in game.One issue I have with the gameplay is the constant bobbing when moving your tank. This makes aiming and shooting a lot harder than it needs to be. The camera bob even gets in the way when you are moving. I am not sure if this was to replicate how being in a tank feels like but this just comes off as very annoying.Another issue with the gameplay that I have revolves around the two ammo types which are the armor piercing rounds and the explosive rounds. The two ammo types seem to function extremely similar to one another as they seem to eliminate the target in about the same amount of rounds fired. The only difference I was able to spot was that explosive rounds have some splash damage to them.My next issue comes from the map pool. Now I know that the Tokyo Warfare team is small but would it have hurt to have at least another map or two? I don't know maybe this is just me being a bit picky.While I am on the topic of maps, one of the more annoying problems I have with the game comes from the map design. On both Naniwa-Ku and Oi Terminal, It is very easy to get stuck on things such as a little piece of the wall poking out or even by something completely unknown. This can become aggravating as this can allow an enemy player to acquire a cheap shot on you just because you are unable to move due to being stuck on something you should not be on.Tokyo Warfare was a game I was really looking forward to. I was amused at the idea of a fast paced tank shooter. Sadly, the current issues with the game prevent me from enjoying the game as much as I would like to. On the plus side the devs are active on the forums and are willing to take feedback to improve the game. My review may change in the future but as of now, I have to sadly rate this game down. I believe this game has a lot of potential and I am hoping that the devs make the necessary changes so that Tokyo Warfare can become a better game.*Btw if the devs are reading this, in the about this game section under the ""moar"" section, vehicle is spelled as vehycle."

Previously, you only have T80 for Russian and Type 10 for JSDF. Now Russian got T-72, T95 Black Eagle, and T-14 Armata while JSDF got Type 90. Maybe in future we can see modernized Type 74? Who know, but this new addition greatly improve the game.Another improvement is a lot of UI get reworked. Some are necessary to facilitate new tanks, some are improving old UI. It certainly more user-friendly than before.All in all, yes, i still recommend this game, especially for you WoT players who tired with random match.-----UPDATE-----Developer team quickly address some issue that really annoying, which is great of them (hey, after playing WoT for so long any kind of quick response is great in comparison). So here i updated my review, old review can be read down below. Note that i haven't try online mode, only arcade so far.First, with X-axis and Y-axis sensitivity slider implemented, its way better. Disorientation problem still exist but with a little practice and lowering your X-axis sensitivity into VERY LOW, it become less problem than before.The physic still need improvement (if you collide with some obstacle it can be quite... weird) and I will suggest to lower hull traverse a bit. Able to access gameplay option from main menu will be very helpful too(curently you can only access it when you are in match). But well, its more playable and certainly better from what i played yesterday.Map selection for Arcade mode still limited, only three for now, but what already available is not bad. Arcade gameplay basically just kill all enemies within time limit or until certain number. But it less boring than what it sounded since it quick-paced, and less stressing than playing other tank games.Maybe in future we can see more tanks or factions, and new game mode or maps would great too, but for now this game is okay. I recommend it if you need some break from WoT or WT:GF; or if you got some spare money. At least your teammates AI in arcade can't be worse.-------Old Review-----It got potential, it can be fun, but as now the dev team have a lot a work to do to make it more fun.One major problem is movement. I feel the Turret Traverse and hull rotation is way too fast. Its become a problem since if you are using first person view, you can easily disoriented. And the physic seems kinda borked too.I gotta say if you have a spare money, they why not. But honestly, as now it still need more refinement. I can see myself playing this game for lulz after a bad night with WoT or WG:GF if above issue get addressed."

,Recommended,486510,33995625,Posted: 3 August,all,Shakira Magala,"This game is interesting, I found that you can easily get stuck on objects, but that doesn't mean for ever.. Everything in the game (mostly, or at least as far as I could tell.. and other that the ground..) is destructible, so you can break free. The initial entry into the game I didn't know that the AI was preset, might get annoying, but I can deal with it, hopefully though the dev will remove it, or at least set it up to actually have enemies in the preset, so far there is no enemies, to you'll launch into a game with only allies.. it's actually kinda funny in a way. Unlike other games, the Dev actually got back to me, and informed me of this, and it did help. I hope he/she keeps doing so, it'd be awesome! For now I haven't actually played that much, as like I said, I couldn't figure out why there were no enemies, and so I couldn't rank up.As for the price, it's a game that could be worth the initial price, but as of right now, no it's not. There are far to little people to have it so high, $9.99 is actually a pretty good price, and believe it or not, far more appealing to those who see it's still in early access. The games is pretty fricken amazing as it is, but I feel like it's still an early access (if it's not that is), and the price range can pull a lot more people into the game. Another thing, when looking into games with tanks, a lot of people will compare you to WoT, War Tinder, and Armored Warfare.... AW less so.You're game plays a lot like AW, which as far as I could tell, seems to be very much alike, which isn't an insult, the game was made by obsidian, which has like 15 teams on one game at a time, you're only what, maximum 5 people, and if I heard Captainsparklez correctly, I think he said 1 person. But it's far more Arcadey than even WoT. it's like GuP met with Rush from the N64 met with Panzer Elite, but with the graphics of AW, and the quality of WoT. the game doesn't look super filmy, and it runs pretty smooth, I kinda wish the menu music to start wouldn't murder my hearing (I turned it down, but please have standard sound lower for future players).Gun Constraints and HUD look as if the Dev got influence from the Battlefield Series, look like the HUD from BF3, might be more similar to BF4, but to me, they were basically the same thing.The Ammo seems to useless when deciding between the two types, HE seems to be the best bet in this game, there is no indication of HP in the game (if there will ever be, that's yet to be asked), which makes AP seem useless as Tracking isn't a thing, and ammo racking isn't in the game yet either, also making it so spotted targets appear clearer, especially in maps with visual imparities. Also a variety of ammo types within the different nations, and making it so, the more you use a tank the better it gets, kinda like adding a crew, but you're the crew, so making the tanks reply better to your imputs over time, would be pretty interesting. Also adding a way to make it so you'll never have to face a Maus or Abrams in a Cromwell, also the T-34-85's seem to be able to one-shot all tanks it faces if it can pen it. I was on 100% HP in the Japanese MBT and the T-34-85 hit me in the side and killed me instantly.. it was the only enemy around other than one of the I-Go Ko's. Take that glorious monster down a notch. The only way you should have to face later era tanks, is if you're playing with friends and just screwing around. Which brings me to another point, Private Servers, also maybe adding LAN Support, allowing friends to mess around on a LAN Server. Also if you could (I myself haven't played a multiplayer server so I haven't checked if this isn't there or not) add bots to Multiplayer games, just as filler so the game isn't so empty, and they be like a phantom slot, so when a slot is filled by a player the bot will leave.All round Good game, so far. I'll extend this later.[Edited]"

I got on my computer and found it on Steam, and bought it without even asking myself ""are you really going to do this?"". I've played the game a bit and realy it is not too bad.good points- cute anime commanders- tanks- killing tanks- killing yourself with high explosive ammunition- killing friendlies by accident- arcade mode ( I havemnt touched multiplayer because of my World of Tanks multiplayer flashbacks)- controller support? (idk i havent tried it... yet :))- classic tanks like the Tiger, Tiger II, Panzer IV and many others- flashbacks to GIrls und Panzer (with the Type 89)heres the criticism- interface is a bit ehh, its not for me tbh- for me it was kind of a werid game to get used to (probably cause i accidentally skipped the tutorial)- is there a better way to stop the tanks? it seems like theres no actual brake, just the reversing the direction and waiting- i have a really high performance computer and I can only manage about 25-30 fps. optimization?- I can't help but say this also. The first American tank you unlock isnt even American. It's a British Sherman Firefly. Just a Sherman with a 17 pounder gun in a modified turret. Sorry I'm a tank nerd and had to point it outFor a not even year old game this one is pretty good. The arcade mode is fun. The ranking up doesnt feel like a grind, its just fun. The anime commanders are cute, which is a plus. I haven't even played this game for 2 hours or had the game for longer than that but it is good and I enjoy it. I'd love to see this game grow even more and see more iconic tanks from WWII and even today in the game, IS series of tanks, Merkava series, Chinese tanks like the Type 59, Type 90, 96, and 99. This would make the game amazing :))))"

A couple of interesting issues though. As a tank fanatic, I would have expected the Armor Piercing rounds to do more damage than the explosive. Not the case. Too bad it always spawns you amongst a group of enemies with AP rounds selected. I give it a 6/10. This is my second time purchasing it since my first was almost exactly a year ago.

The environments are well-designed and the destruction is deeply satisfying. Unfortunately, it has started off with some issues (poor hit detection, spawn glitches, odd control issues) but I've been extremely impressed by the dev's response; the game has already been patched once and further patches are coming in 24-hour cycles to address criticism and bugfixes. The game is also somewhat barebones at the moment with only two playable teams/tanks and two city maps, however the dev apparently intends to add content regularly once the core game is satisfactory, which is fine by me.That aside, the incredibly fun core gameplay and the dev's deep involvement with the community have encouraged me to stick with Tokyo Warfare despite its current flaws. If you played Tokyo Wars back in the day or are just hungry for a goofy tank battle sim, this is worth an investment; just keep in mind that it's an evolving product that will continue to recieve polish."

It deserves all the good ratings it's getting, and I cheer you on, dev!Despite some weird auto-aim lock-ons while using a mouse, the controls are very responsive and twitch-friendly if you're looking for those 360 one-shots (Don't get too excited, that never actually happens unless the enemy is basically dead already.) Visuals are crisp, and the sprites/effects give a real sense of danger, especially when those bright explosions go off in your face! Maps are expansive and meticulously crafted, and the destructable environment grealtly enhances the realism. (You know, instead of everything escape TANK SHELLS unscathed.)That being said, there's a rather small amount of content at the moment. The UI is somewhat lackluster (but there *are* tons of options), and besides just shooting each other up, there's really not much else to do. This game exceeds in everything except content depth at the time of writing. Pretty, but that only goes so far. (I've played for less than thirty minutes, but I'm not necessarily the largest fan of tank sims. I've simply been following this game for awhile and I was curious to see what the final product looked like.)TL;DR: It looks incredibly pretty, handles alright control-wise, not very much content outside of deathmatch and basic leveling. Definintely worth getting, but only if you convince a couple friends to play it too.I'll definintely keep an eye on this game; it's got so much potential."

Spawning can be glitched as the game doesn't check to see if a spawn point is occupied before generating a new friendly or enemy team mate. A few times I've spanned inside of an enemy tank or on top of one. If the controls were a bit more responsive and there was less clipping issues with smoother gameplay there can be something here.There's no campaign mode for single player, a basic mode would have been welcome, and the multiplayer seems completely dead even with the recent patch...

Yes, yes, there are still flaws with the game, but, I'm remaining optimistic and hoping that sometime down the line, there will be solutions presented (for example, team selection in arcade mode is a tad uninuitive, since the game was originally made for only two factions, but now there are five.) Still, if you're able to get a good grip on the controls, have a somewhat powerful system to run it on, and are willing to put up with a few unintuitive parts, then you can have quite a bit of fun! There's even quite a few features that are implemented, and can be greatly expanded upon in due time, however, the developer (yes, one person) does have quite a bit that they're working on, and are very responsive and quick to look at issues, from what it appears.Overall, I'd say this is a very fun game, may not be the greatest tank arcade shooter, but, it is, indeed very fun. ...If only there were more people to play with for online games, ah well, can't have it all.Also, a couple little tips, at least with the current state of the game: With tanks, using explosive rounds is preferable since you can deal damage to both the chassis and turret, but it has a higher shell drop. Armor piercing are much better at sniping in tanks, and it appears against flat angles, does more damage than explosive to the compenent that was hit. And, if you want to rank up fast, currently, going on the flat arena map, and going up against a large enemy team composed of Type 89's (Japanese WWII era medium tank) with kills required set to 0 and a time limit of 10-20 minutes is the most efficient way."

That being said, it's not without its flaws. For example, if you try to aim to the left but move faster than your turret does, it will keep going after you stop moving your mouse for a little while. Likewise, if you switch between camera modes too much it will glitch out and not allow you to aim while also forcing your camera to move around randomly.There also is only one real game mode in which you just fight head to head trying to rake in kills. No capture points, no flags, nothing. Just TDM.Also the camera tries to adjust for you. This means if you're looking at a fence then move your courser juuuuust above the top of it, the camera will jolt up as it acquires the longer range you're now zeroed for.It seems older tanks have even worse controls too. I often find myself trying to look up (in a %100hp tank, no damage taken) only to be stuck looking at the ground until it registers my movement and makes me look straight up.This game has promise, it really does, but it needs a lot of work before I could ever recommend it."

So I now recommend this thing. However, I'd rather keep my old review as a record.Before 'first of all...' I would like to comment about the good things of this game. It has pretty graphics with all kinds of fx/shader/filters. The music comes in different sets and you can play your own music as well. Radio chatters are mostly atmospheric since, well, there's not so much use for a radio in an arcade shooter.Then here comes the complaints.First of all, I bought this with the idea in mind that it's based on an arcade game and an arcade game wouldn't and shouldn't be some serious tank simulator where you need like a whole keyboard of keys to start the engine. However, it is still not so good even as an arcade game.Lacks a functional tutorial / encyclopedia thing that enables me to realise what I am actually doing. There is a video tutorial which is outdated(having GUIs and vehicle lists from an apparently older version of the game) and, honestly, hard to use as a tutorial. There's only play, pause and restart implemented to the video player. Also the language is quite broken, and if I weren't a Chinese I'd have a hard time understanding the tutorial texts.Lacks a 1600x900 resolution, honestly I don't understand why this resolution is missing.Also concerning resolutions, the game fails to lock my cursor to the middle of the screen(which is a must for fps/tps games) after I alt+tabbed a few times. The fullscreen / windowed 1920x1080 (full resolution for my screen) fails to overlap the task bar, making vehicle type selection button inaccessible.* The dev has made a quick fix about this, see comment.Stats like armour thickness, penetration etc. are black-boxed, but in general the more modern tanks win.

There is no stress or competitive nature to this game its just having fun in 60+ tonne tanks, whats not to love. The only thing I wish there was more of was levels to level up and more tanks to unlock."

,Recommended,486510,35231228,Posted: 26 September,all,[SMC] Raptor,"Pretty good arcade tank game. Fun for a few hours and you can do anything from impossible battles to a roflstomp against horribly underpowered tanks. AI is absolutely awful, and it's basically dead online.The biggest disappointment is the lack of players online combined with the amount of potential this game has that it will probably never be able to live up to. Kudos to the dev for updating it this long after launch (especially considering in his own words, working fast food would get him more money than this game has).Frustrating camera/aim inconsistencies and weird, slippery tank handling will often ruin what fun there is to be had. There's a decent selection of maps and a pretty good variety of tanks, though balance is basically non-existent once you unlock anything past the first two. Throwing WWII era tanks against a T-14 armata will go about as well as you expect."
