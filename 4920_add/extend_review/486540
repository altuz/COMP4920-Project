,Not Recommended,486540,28131253,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,Kaimelar,"Purchased this without researching it first. Got into it and realized how similar it is to several free-to-play browser-based city-builders I've regretfully tried out. Proceeded to do some research and find out that it is ported from a mobile version that contains microtransactions.If I wanted the experience of a F2P time-waster clicker game with IAP, I would go find one of those and play it, not pay $10 for what I'm led to believe (initially) is a full and proper game."
,Recommended,486540,30543088,Posted: 16 March,all,Desastreger,"I'll try to be the tiebreaker to the two types of reviews I'm seeing here.To make this very clear, the game doesn't have any in-game purchases anymore and in order to buy ""shortcuts"" you have to complete quests; which makes sense.  It's not pay-to-win, it's grind-until-you-can't-take-it-anymore.  It's relaxing, so if you're into european colony sim games, you'll probably come back for more.It's the most similar game to Settlers II I have seen since Settlers II with a couple of differences that you would think add depth or annoyance:It has a couple annoying quirks such as having to click on buildings to collect taxes and have to click three times to repair buildings.  All of that is automated after a certain point of each game yet you can't help to feel you're playing a mobile game (which it used to be).It has micromanagement, lots of it.  You have to manage buildings and occupancy; forget something and you'll end up screwed eventually.  You also have TINY warehouses, so you need to keep track of them and sell to a merchant that doesn't invest (ever) in transportation.  Seems roads were dangerous as they wouldn't buy stuff in bulk.It has a research ""tree"" that unlocks while you're gaining experience; now, here's the interesting thing: experience carries on through different playthroughs.  So you can't see everything or run a high-octane colony during the first playthrough (or you can but it gets so Factorio you'd rather start over).  Maps are small and for good reason, I remember havng Settlers II colonies so huge that at some point everything broke down in inefficiency that it was only but a beautiful mess.  In here you destroy and replace.Is it worth full price? I'm not sure... I had such a Settlers itch that for me it was.  I'm having fun.Clear as mud?"
,Not Recommended,486540,30202247,Posted: 26 February,all,Robhold,"This game is a scam. It's a mobile game focused on microtransactions. They didn't even take the time to translate to PC, i.e. you can't use your mouse! you have to use the ASDW keys to move THE WHOLE screen to place a building. Graphics are really buggy, and it can take up to 15 mins to build a simple woodcutter's hut (the most basic, first building in the tutorial) unless you fast forward it with.. guess what.. a microtransaction $Guys, I didnt want to pay attention to the reviews bc I wanted to play a Settler's style game so much but this is really a bad, lazy scam"

But all in all, a very solid, stable, easy to get into game that could easily consume hundreds of hours of playtime, so well worth the asking price."

76561198057905130,Recommended,486540,28588830,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,Skullface,"Now what we have here: Townsmen!From the first impressions of videos and screenshots, yet another ported Mobile Platformer.I am not sure why exactly i am giving this game a thumbs up, but after sinking like 80h (yes, i have no hobbies) into this,overall i am satisfied with the game.Maybe its just for the sake, that its like settlers, KAM, alien nations or annoSettlers and KAM, because you can build flourishing towns with 100's of ... ""people""Alien Nations, because your population has needs that need to be filledAnno, simply for the economic side. Buildings cost upkeep as in repair costs. Money income is generated via trade and taxing.For the side of battle or warfare: almost close to not present, unless you play in sandbox with threat of bandits enabled, even most missions dont contain them. Not that i really would have a problem with that. I like to build.There also is a kind of RPG like leveling system, that unlocks different ""Researches"" which unlock bonuses that carry over from map to map.A point of critic to me is the storage capacity.The trader has a limited trade capacity. Sometimes you produce more than you really need. When that leads then to a storage overflow, you have to trash stuff.Would really suggest to add a like ""Amount of items to keep in stock""-function, that stops the pickup of specified wares, once it hits set amount.Now for something completely different: Premium Currency.From what i read here and there, the mobile platform versions do have microtransaction in them. Not the case here.Weither you play the scenarios, and earn it by completing them, or you go for sandbox mode, and simply do the re appearing mission over and over, until you feel like you got enough.Not sure what i would state as a finish.""A causual town sim. Not too difficult. Child friendly.""""Simple and Effective, if you just want to create something""""For me it was alright, but thats just me."""
,Recommended,486540,30379975,Posted: 7 March,all,MarquisBS,"So I test played it after playing the mobile version for a long time.+ No more microtransaction+ Settler style gameplay+ Simple but still challenging enough+ relaxing+ Fluffy graphics+ Lot of moving peopleEveryone follows a daily routine (Going to work, work, go home, go drinking or look at any of the buildable statues and more)+ People get Sick+ Buildings need maintainance+ On some maps you will be attacked by raiders+ Mastering the resource flow can take some hours+ Unlimited forward button (You have to pay with in game money or buy in mobile version but not here)+ Key bindings+ Good mouse implementation- No sync functionality with google play or iCloudGoogle Play Sync would be the only thing i'd ask for at this point. Everything else is really good for a mobile game port!"

Great builder/crafter game.Pros:  easy interface, cute storylines, smooth game playCons:  needs more maps... or maps that can be added on somehow (gamer developed, or PTP maps)Overall:  recommended.... great way to kill some time"
,Recommended,486540,29034341,Posted: 5 January,all,Captain Jack |,"[4 hours of gaming]This game has such potential, but they screwed it all upp by forcing all the cost to involve coins...+ The campain was great, easy to work with and gave alot of valid information.+ I love the layout of the maps, it's made like the game, The Settlers.- repairing buildings cost coins, not stone & wood.If you'd have to pay coins to renovate, you should at least make the lumbermills and all other factories pay a seperate tax payment!- In the building menu you can't toggle the locked buildings in order to get information of which buildings you would need to have in order to unlock the building. You HAVE to click the locked building to get this information.- The names of each building, in the buildingmenu, doesn't pop-up. You HAVE to click the building in order to see what the building is good for, (this makes it confusing when you're trying to complete missions, since you have no idea of what building you need to build).- No Restart button.[7 hours of gaming]+Once you've leveled up to about level 9 and upgraded some stuff, the game starts to become more fun. You get more understanding of the concept and you start earning alot of coins! Like 10k+ coins.+ When you've got 4 tax collectors, you wont need to click all the time on houses to collect coins. Finally more freedom for building!+ Upgrading buildings is important in order to use the houses full potential.+ Getting a carpenter helps you to repair ALL buildings so that you don't have to repair them manually (That's if you got the coins to pay). Carpenters renovates houses with coins, wood and stone.[11 hours of gaming]- Hmmm... no way to choose prior constructions. If I'm out of coins and have three constructions being built, I'd want to make it possible for me to choose which of these three construstions should get the first set of coins coming from taxes...E.g If I'm building the Church, Fire Tower and the Carpenter's Shop, but dont have that amount of economy to finish them all at once, and the whole town is on fire, I'd want the builders to prioritize the Fire Tower.- It would really be helpful if one could just simply hoover over the building-icons in the building-menu to get the information of each building. The name of the building, what it does and what it cost. Why would you think that players wants to click on each building to get that information? It's just a waste of time.- You often missclick and open a house... this makes the speed fall to normal... really annoying!+ I managed to build a quite big city and it flourished, but then all of the sudden everybody got sick and left my city. It didn't matter that I had one Infirmary. Probably need to build an infirmary every 1000 meters or so, but this information isn't given. So there is a challange just to understand how the developers have been thinking :PAs I said in the beginning, this game could become great! There are just some features that needs to be added. I would also want the developers to change the main menu for the map-selection. it's way too confusing and too little maps to choose from."

The best part of this game is developing complex production chains and watching your townies go about their daily lives. It's fun watching them go to work, or watching them visit a pub when they need a drink. Good Stuff!"

I've posted the bugs and my observations in the discussion area, I'll amend this review if and when these problems get fixed (and any others i may find) to me at the moment the game is way over pricededit:1. after restarting the tutorial everything is good(i duno what caused my glitch).2. scrolling in window mode work around : If your having probs with the window being same size or biffer than screen reduce size of window.3. I have been informeds that there is no voice over in the dialogues, that setting is for the townies/townets sounds they make4. I am a lot happier with the game now but still think its over priced (I think that half the price should be good.) suggest waiting for sales/specials5. The game so far has some depth to it that could be a handfull to manage in a full blown map full of buildings"

The game still lacks severely regular updates from the developer which is a major issue. Because of the fact that these developers are so lazy that they refuse to update the game on a regular basis tells me that they just don't care. There's still hardly any new maps in the sandbox mode of the game.There's still no map editor. This game just keeps going from bad to worse all the time. Everyone do youself a favor and avoid this game at all costs don't even waste your time or money on this garbage of a time.My rating is /10 If I could give this game a lower rating I would. In fact I don't even think this game deserves a rating at all It's so terrible.

I thought with it being a mobile game before it was ported to PC that it might not be very good....but it is! It has 18 various scenarios in ""campaign"" mode and 18 maps in sandbox mode. Each map is pretty good and varied. I played through the short tutorial then tried a sandbox game. I got in over my head by building too much but that wasn't important as I wanted to get a good grip on what the game has to offer. It's pretty indepth regarding research and upgrading....I'm really enjoying the expreience and would recommend it to anyone that has played the likes of Banished."
