Here we have, in one game, a masterpiece that rivals Hideo Kojima's own Metal Gear Solid franchise as a whole. The depth of story, character diversity and development is truly a remarkable achievement, with graphics that shatter all expectations and wholly flushed out and ever changing gameplay mechanics that will leave you wanting more from start to finish. I came here looking for a game...but what I got was an experience unlike anything I could have imagined. I implore you, the consumer, to buy this game and support the love, devotion, blood, sweat and TEARS poured into this master class of gaming. Because it's not just a game...this...this is a work of art.10/10"

It had a perfect mix of drama and horror with a pinch of comedy placed at the right moments. All characters were amazingly unique and I enjoyed how expressive each voice actor was.Looking forward to a sequel!!! :)

,Recommended,486650,29172639,Posted: 10 January,all,Kaz (Select Input),"A masterpiece beyond compare, Potato Thriller is a biting satire of both video game culture and modern society. It is an unparalled achievement and will be smiled upon by our children, raised aloft on their shoulders and forever worshipped as that one time, together, we were all Video Games.Potato Thriller is a humorous, intentionally terrible parody of the horror demo P.T., and it will probably upset and anger most players, as a lot of the ""gameplay"" is purposefully obtuse. I found it to be entertaining, and it will be helping to fuel my darkest nightmares for quite some time. For $3, it was worth it, but if you're not totally clear on what you're getting into, it might not be for you."
