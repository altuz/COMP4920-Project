I just saw it pop up on the Vive Subreddit (great community there btw) and purchased it to suprise her. So far...she hasn't had a turn. Obviously....I had to test it first! It was much more fun playing than I ever thought it would have been. Not sure if it has to do with VR but I had a blast. Then I discovered the Arcade mode...thats even better!! I hear that the devs are going to put additional features, some new to the franchise for VR and that might add some additional value for the veterns. It runs great as well (using gtx 970). Be carefull though, I just broke my first wrist strap on my ceiling fan. Edited because I before E except after C...thanks phxrockerUpdate 8/4/2016:They just released a Survival mode and it so much fun! It is pretty hard as well. This is very different from any other version of Fruit Ninja and these little Helecopter baskets with a mounted cannon shoot fruit at you. Eventually, if you survive, more and more show up. The fun is when the bombs start shooting at you as well. Those you have to duck and dodge. Really fun and so worth the price!"

Besides, you are only cutting fruits on a 2D plane.Fruit Ninja VR is another interesting take in the series. This is the closest thing to cutting fruits for real.Both controllers are swords, but you can use one and leave the other on the floor or on a table.

My wife had a lot of fun when she realised that she could skewer the fruit instead of just slicing it, and I had some fun messing around with the physics throwing fruit up in the air trying to catch it in my mouth (I do not recommend trying this with Watermelons in real life), but otherwise it plays pretty much exactly the same as the mobile version - just in VR.One disadvantage of this version over the mobile version is that the limited FOV in current generation headsets means you often won't see the fruit fly up on your sides (I figured out a trick though - keep an eye on the shadows).It has the same game modes as the mobile version - Zen (no bombs), Classic (slow paced) and Arcade (fast paced), but I would have really liked some more content since PC > mobile (like the various sword fighting games in Wii Sports & Wii Sports Resort)... but I can't fault it for delivering exactly what it promised on the tin."

At least 7 years years I remember this game being ""cutting edge"" technology on mobile. Now some time later I am playing that same game in VR feeling the same thing. I have a lot of hours into Zenblade and I am not here to compare the two games. I am here to say they are both very different for being the same kind of game. Fruit Ninja VR allows certain liberties like being able to cut Fruit with the back end of the blade and cross blades without collision. Very enjoyable game with much replay value. It will be a must on the demo list when people come over to try VR for the 1rst time.Here is my Sword Setup for any game Sword related.

,Recommended,486780,24258999,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Nutz4VR,"I am writing this review from inside of my iphone. I don't know how I got in here... But its absolutely incredible!Fruit Ninja VR is a must have game for the Vive, just as Fruit Ninja was a must have app for any smartphone owner! Halfbrick really found a great way to take an old franchise, and put it into a whole new light! Fruit Ninja has officially been...Re""Vive""d!The moment you put on your headset, you are greeted with three different gamemode options, all included in the original smartphone game.The first mode is Arcade. This mode has you going up against the clock to see how many points you can earn within a one minute time frame. Combos and bonuses are your friend here, so be sure to rack up as many as you can. All bombs must be avoided, as slicing one would result in an instant ""Game Over!""The second mode is Classic. Here you must slice as many fruit as you can while attempting to avoid the oncoming bombs. Failing to slice a fruit that you are presented with before it hits the ground will earn you a strike. Three of these, and ""Your out!"" The goal in this mode is to gain as many points as possible within an infinite amount of time.The third and final mode is Zen. While very similar to Arcade mode, it does have its differences. There are zero bombs in this mode, and your main focus is slicing fruit and earning combos. There is also a time limit that you are up against. You have 90 seconds to slice, dice, and cut as many of those fruits that you possibly can.I personally find all three of these modes to give an equal amount of enjoyment.The leaderboards for each gamemode are one of the greatest aspects of this game. Attempting to go for the communities high score is very addictive and a ton of fun!Graphically this game is gorgeous! The animated cartoony style looks and feels really cool in VR! The swords are shiny and reflective, the background is visually pleasing, and all the small elements of this game are very detailed and polished.All of the sound effects in this game are actually pretty nostalgic. Many of them are taken straight from the original game, and it fits so perfectly in this one.The controls of this game are so simple, that if you have arms, you can play. Slicing is the only required movement in this game, and there is not a single button that you must press to activate anything! Not only are the controls simple, but they are very intuitive. There have been no occurrences of any missed fruit slicing or bomb hits that have not been my own fault. Don't mistake having the fruit or bomb bounce off your sword as a glitch. You must slice them, not just let your sword touch them. The swords move around beautifully, and even make a swooshing sound when you swing them.If the amount of content is what's holding you back from buying this game, don't fret. Its still incredible at its current state + Multiplayer, new maps, and new weapons are on the way. This game is still in early access.The next generation of ninja fruit slicing is here...And its wonderful!"
,Recommended,486780,26486666,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,Just Asian,"Very nice adaptation of the famous mobile app. This VR game feels really responsive and well made. My family and I had tons of fun competening with each other! The four game modes are quite good (my personal favorite is Arcade because of the rythm).On the negative side, the game lacks content. While I understand that the leaderboard is the main rationale to beat the best score, I feel like there is not much to do beside that. This game needs more content as in the mobile app: more blades, more backgrounds with bonuses, more challenges etc.Overall a good VR game tho. On the VR scale of rating: 78/100"

It includes new mechanics such as making a 'shishkebab' out of fruit, or pushing bombs aside... you feel like a real fruit ninja...My reasoning behind not giving it a  10/10 even though I am praising it so much is the simple fact that the sensitivity could be better... That's it.

The graphics are more or less the same as ZenBlade. The sound seems to be great. The fruit flying is nice and the katana sound is so soothing. ZenBlade may have more game options but Fruit Ninja VR has that classic feel to it. Something that we can enjoy without too much effort.With the game as it is now it is fun and relaxing to play.

The physics are realistic enough to feel satisfying and fake in a way that makes you feel stronger and more talented than you would be in real life.  The katanas feel very light and with the flick of your wrist you can slice a coconut in half or send a bomb flying up in the air.  The stereo audio is pretty well done and offers enough cues so that you know when a piece of fruit pops up outside of your range of vision.  I think they've squeezed as much technology into this game as possible making it one of the richest vr experiences I've seen so far.  And the music is great too.

The discrepancy by how amazingly sklilled you think you look as a ninja, and how stupid and useless you look as a casual observer is just delicious."

,Recommended,486780,31620075,Posted: 8 May,all,Diversian,"This is pretty close to perfect. I know it's one of the early VR games, and I know Fruit Ninja lost some steam after it's been EVERYWHERE. But, like Angry Birds would, it just works well in VR. It is a great showcase for VR, will have amazing replayability when unlocks are added, and will be just as fun 3 years from now as it is today. It's one example where the VR version is better than the mobile.I played the ""other fruit game"" and was sorely disappointed. This game is far better. The fruit looks more cartoony, but that is what's needed for this type of game. Until our display quality is 4 times higher in VR, there's no sense in trying to make fruit photorealistic.Pros- easy to learn / difficult to master- priced alright for the hours you'll spend- extremely well polishedCons- medium replayability today (needs some unlocks)- the other gameplay styles don't add much varietyIf you have the money and don't have another sword slicing game for VR, get it. If you catch this on sale, get it. If you have the other fruit game, this game is far more polished but the same game otherwise. No point getting this too until there's a little more meat on the bone. Add it to your follow list and watch for updates."

,Recommended,486780,31608063,Posted: 7 May,all,Johnny5point6,"This, along with Space Pirate Trainer are the two games that everybody should have. They are both simple, and straightforward, but all of the elements are implemented so well, that they just feel great to play. This one in particular, gets you moving a lot. The swords render wonderfully, and the physics of chopping and stabbing feels great (you can even bounce objects off of the blunt side of your sword, and stab items too). There are a couple of modes to choose from, each one has a twist, and feels different. It really is a no brainer. This and Space Pirate Trainer are the definite 'get your VR sea legs' that everybody needs."

76561197997794666,Recommended,486780,30118325,Posted: 23 February,all,Tikigod,"One of my favorite sword games.  Great to jump in and out quick to relax after work.  Graphics and VR experience are very solid.  You do stand in fixed postion with only ability to turn 360 degrees.  Most of the fruit action occurs in front of you (not from behind)  You only have one scene or play area.  The physics of the fruit are very good as far as slicing, stabbing, and tap bumping items such as bombs to the side.  Highly recommend if you enjoy sword style games.  The physics in manipulating the fruit movement with swords are spot on. Modeling of katanas are very good as well.  Look forward to updates.  I would like to see upgrades to style of different swords, maybe things to collect, or change of scenery.   Game is mostly point based to gain highest score.  Very good quality VR title that looks and feels polished."

There's is only 4 very similar game modes, only one scenery, no modifications of the weapons like in the cellphone version.

76561198347966442,Recommended,486780,29511304,Posted: 26 January,all,aharshvive,"Tons of fun and the accuracy is great. You can stab fruit, slice individually from any direction, do combos for more points, and smack bombs aside with the side of the blade. Great game to show people who won't be into shooters or scary heights games. There's don't let any fruit fall mode, score as much as possible without hitting bombs mode, and just score as much as possible mode, but my favorite is survival mode. All the other modes deal mostly with horizontal cuts, but in survival mode canons launch fruit at you so your cuts are usually going away from you rather than side to side. It really makes a difference slashing away and I like how that switches it up."

Operating the settings menu and filling in your highscores info on the Oculus Touch leaves alot to be desired. If they fixed that one things, I'd say theres nothing that needs fixed. 4.5/5"
,Not Recommended,486780,29729353,Posted: 5 February,all,Please Clap.,"Great game and a ton of polish, but it's missing one of the most important things for a vr game: the ability to not crash every time you exit. If you were to try and open another game after you're finished playing Fruit Ninja, the Vive headset fully shuts off and exits Steam VR. If you want to have ~ an hour long VR session, make sure this is the last game on your list.Other than that one fatal flaw, it's a great game and a ton of fun. I'd recommend putting one controller down, and double-handing only one sword. Feels much better, and makes you less likely to 'flail' your controllers in front of you hoping to hit everything."

I never understood the appeal of swiping with our fingers over a screen pretending you're slicing fruits with a sword.This game on the other hand is more like it! It is almost like this game was made for VR in the first place.It's easy to control, very colorful and beautiful graphics and some interesting modes to switch between. And you will not cut off your fingers in the process, which is a big plus am i right?But it has to be said: 15$ for a simple game as this is maybe a bit over the top.I recomend it but i'll suggest you wait until it's on sale."
