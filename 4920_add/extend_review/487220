Althought this game is too short it has been good designed about play with angles.In my opinion this game should be free due lack of content,but i can't complain about it, due i received it for free.Final score:★★☆☆☆Barely recommended."
,Recommended,487220,24658309,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,Elitetruppe,"Freebie Review - Rating: 6.3/10General ImpressionFreebie is a well-made game, in which you need to score as high as you can. After you have scored 50 points, all the achievements will be done. It took me a really while to get them all, I died so much. The graphics and the textures are neat and colorful. The epilepsy mode has advanced graphics on the overall surface, where the balls bounces. The atmosphere varies between a normal one (the colors on the background will change without flashing or anything special) and one where it has a bunch of colors rotating and which will flash constantly, giving you a harder time to conquer the score. There are 2 green bars and 2 red bars, which are consecutively one after another in a square. If you hit the green ones, you get a point. In the center, there is a paddle, which is constantly rotating. There you will hit the ball which will go into the bars. And also, after hitting 10, 20, 30, etc. points, the paddle will rotate quicker, making it harder to hit the correct bars. To get all the achievements, you must reach the 50 score. You will die a lot, especially if your reflexes are not very good. I have talked about the gameplay too, off to other features: The user-interface is very simple, and with no special designs, representing the retro era a lot, just like this game. The controls… the mouse doesn’t even work, hence the game says that it has mouse support. Maybe it is just for me, but I played very well with the arrows as well. Overall, they are simple and easy to learn. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are neat and well-designed. Freebie is a cute indie game, where you will face many deaths before reaching a decent score. Good for the ones who want to improve their reflexing skills.Positive PointsNeat graphics and textures2 types of neat atmospheresPretty nice audio and musicFun and challenging gameplaySimple user-interfaceSimple controlsPretty stable enginesPretty nice mechanicsSteam achievementsTrading cardsNeutral PointsSome more additional designs would be niceThere should be more music soundtracksNegative PointsThis game is hard for people who don’t have good reflexes or a very high concentrationRight now it has little content"

After this crushing realization I decided to give the game a try since I'm stuck with it now. It is incredibly simple yet more difficult than I first thought. I thought I would only put a few minutes into it but now I have the desire to get all of the achievements...*Update*I got all the achievements! Seeing as the game took me about the same amount of time to play as I paid for it I have decided to not refund it.

,Recommended,487220,24014688,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Singast,"How to describe Freebie in a sentence: A simple yet hard game, that is more frustrating than fun, but gives you a great feeling of accomplishment in the end.This game is very simple, it's a square which has a green angle and a red angle. The objective is to throw a fire ball (looks like a fire ball) into a spining bar in the middle of the screen to make the ball touch the green angle.. Sounds simple, eh?Well, it's not.. since you have 3 tries before the game over, and after each 10 points (10,20,30,40...) the speed of the spining bar increases. Once you reach 30 points the bar moves so quickly that is really hard to predict where the ball touches the bar.The controls are very simple you can use your mouse or press the up and left key to throw a ball from the top left corner or the right and down key to shoot the ball from the bottom right corner. Clicking the boxes with the mouse was much easier for me.In the main menu you can choose 3 different 8-bit music, which are nice, but in the long term it makes you more frustrated with the game. There is also the option 'No Music', though you still have the sounds of the game.My veredict: 7/10. Easy 100% (completed it in 1 hour or so), has trading cards, and overall is a nice little game."
,Not Recommended,487220,23619191,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,Photon Cat,"I just can't understand you who rate the game a thumb up. The game is only about shooting a ball from either corner from the square to hit a green edge, with terrible sound effects and, if you want, infinite looping BGM. I bet a script can do a better job than mine. There's little fun scoring and since I have only 3 chances to fall, any life lose will be very harmful. I don't think I will ever open the game again, even if the ''game'' reloaded with bikini girls whose cloth will be strip off per 100 score (Which is a good idea to improve your game, developers.).Nice music, BTW. You should make it a OST DLC at $1."

,Recommended,487220,23603927,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,Temperance (XIV),"I have to confess, one of my weaknesses is games that are under a quid on Steam. I just can’t help myself. Anything over that magical threshold and I might question whether it is worth my money, but below that? I’m game. So of course I wasn’t strong willed enough to resist Freebie’s value based allure. Not even the fact a game called “Freebie” cost me 47 pence could turn me away.Freebie’s premise is simple. You bounce balls off of a rotating panel in the centre of the screen and gain points if the ball hits a green wall while avoiding the red walls. The paddle slowly ramps up in speed, increasing the difficulty. A solitary high score counter keeps track of your personal best on the main menu.When not on sale, Freebie costs £0.79 pence on Steam and to be quite honest it certainly looks like it. As you are greeted by the dreadfully plain main menu, the deafening silence is jarring until you choose which of the three tracks to play. A nondescript play button sits near the top of the screen and blends far too easily into the rest of the text. I’ve seen more exciting main menus on ZX Spectrum games.Things don’t get more exciting as you get into game, unfortunately. The concept itself is sound on paper, but is more timing dependent than skill based. There is no timer on firing the ball so any urgency in the game is removed when you realise you have the luxury of being able to calculate the perfect line of attack. As your score increases there is no real sense of progression. There is little to no fanfare about reaching any milestones, save for steam achievements for 10, 20, 30 , 40 and 50 points reached. The backgrounds stay the same, the music does not change, the only thing that changes is the speed of the paddle. At no point do you feel that it is ever ramping up or ""getting real"". The whole experience feels very muted.With the above said, however. I got 20 minutes enjoyment out of it, which is about ten times longer than any Kit Kat for the same price has lasted me. A fun enough little game with an interesting premise that feels like it cost 79 pence and not a penny more. It is worth a try, but have something on standby to fill the longing for something more this games leaves you with."

There is also an epilepsy mode which is the same thing but with an alternating color background designed to distract you and mess with your eyes, I got a score of 40 in that.The game itself is about using angles to bounce 1 of 2 balls (located at opposite sides) off a paddle and hit the 2 green corresponding edges. Depending on which sides the green edges are located you need to pick which ball you should use to hit it effectively, might sound a bit complex but it has a really simple game design when you understand what your meant to do.Every 10 points the paddle in the middle speeds up and from 40 onwards it becomes really difficult to judge/ estimate the required angle.

,Recommended,487220,25518910,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Union,"This game, while rather simple and basic, offers a fair amount of entertainment for the price.  I personally picked this up half off, and it was definitely worth my two quarters.  The premise is simple. You shoot balls at a spinning weiner in the center of the screen, which bounces the ball in some direction.  Now here is where the game gets tricky; the square containing the weiner has 4 walls, 2 of which are green, two are red.  The colors are always connected, so you will never find two greens across from eachother.  If standard gaming conventions haven't taught you anything, or you just prefer to reside under rocks, red is bad, it makes you sad; green is good, it gives you wood.  The game has 3 different selections for background music, all of which are unique and pretty fun to listen to, my favorite for being the third option.  Your options for gameplay are ""play"" and something the devs decided to call ""epilepsy mode.""  The difference between the two is simply the background.  A static background for standard mode, with a spinning background with a brightness that constantly bounces up and down for the epilepsy mode.  While it is rather disorienting, the strobe light setting actually helped me to perfect the game: I will attribute this to pure goodness darn luck rather than skill.  There are 5 acheivements in Freebie, all of which are obtained by reaching the next tier of how fast gumby plays helicopter.  Every 10 points increases the speed, unlocks an acheivement, and gives you a really good overall feeling of accomplishment.  It makes you feel like you have earned your perfect game.  Something that I think is pretty rare.  This game probably won't quite make any top 10 lists, but for the price it offers a fun experience, nice challenge, and good feeling.  The game isn't spectacular, it is incredibly simple with basic geometric graphics, but it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.  It sticks to its simple idea and works as a concept.  I rate this game 6/10."

On the third try I had all the achievements, so I guess this is more like a game which you play if you have just to wait a few minutes for whatever.On some point the game becomes so fast, that it is more like luck shoots you do to hit the walls.+ easy achievements+ trading cards+ eye cancer mode- non satisfying/existing goals- at some point based on luck"

Picked it up off the rack on special offer but even at it's full recommended retail price it is, althrough not vintage, a nice and young thing with a crisp tight pleasant aroma and a hint of the best grapes.The accompaning optional audio while not classical in sense, does add a certain ambience that helps to draw you in an absorbing world. One has to be careful as you risk, that time and space may escape you if you are unprepared. The presentation is basic but competant and reminiscent of a rainbow of primary and secondary colors dropped against a pitch black void of a background.The FPS count remained high with no stuttering, fluctuation or screen tearing and the need for advanced graphics settings are avoided, ensuring more time spent playing then fidderling. My GTX 970 loves this game as it means he can take the afternoon off, so performance and stability should be good wherever you decide to give this little treat a home.Whilst entertaining in a simple way, it is clearly not intended to be as in-depth as Skyrim or as frantic as Battlefield, but is there more for those moments in-between where you just want to experience some low stress simple fun entertainment."

But, there is a sweet spot, but only when the right sides of the sqaure are lit, then you will have to really angle it. It's idea is as simple as pong but a lot more fun. There are some fire tracks to listen to as you play. Overall, this game is just ""simple fun"" with some old school machanics."
