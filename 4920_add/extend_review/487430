(Apparently, the scenes that were cut from the original give it longer length, but not by much).Its good to see more VN's being made by lesser known companies. They should be supported as much as possible."

While returning home to their diner from a delivery one day, Leon and Lucia happen to come across a pink-haired girl Aisia Mayfield sleeping on a red suitcase by the side of the road. Feeling sorry for the girl, they both offer to take in Aisia as a second helper at the diner. Over two episodes, Leon will interact with Lucia, Aisia, Cullen Lancaster (local police officer at Sagami Francisco and the surrounding area) and a stray puppy in a heart-warming tale of friendship, love, kindness, compassion, diligence and sacrifice with a share of humour and fanservice.Although there are no choices to make at all in this game, the CG, opening and ending videos, soundtracks and overall game presentation are great. The story and plot is written like a romantic comedy and has a nice happy ending. Reading through the storyline and dialogue, unlocking all extra content and obtaining all achievements will take less than 10 hours."

The art quality is really good and the story is interesting. Well, I don’t know if it’s because I read the all ages version instead of the R18 one, but some scenes ended so abruptly and that kinda ruined the mood.I also wish they had explained more about the catastrophe.But overall, I recommend this game on a good sale if you want to read something quick and see cute girls.7/10."

,Not Recommended,487430,24016038,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Kalakkuna,"I found out of this kinetic visual novel about week ago and after waiting for multiple reviews to come in I decided to give it a shot.After playing it, I'd like to give this title aneutralrecommendation more than positive or negative, but had to choose one.To begin with, the characters are cute, art is good and the background story is told throughout the novel rather well BUT the story suffers from somewhat bad pacing, narration on few scenes were suddenly rushed ruining the feel for being a good romance novel and the content feels sometimes bit too oversexualized like countless Sakura -titles.The R18 patch adds few scenes to the novel, but I wouldn't recommend it for the story's sake, but for supporting the artist.Otherwise about the novel; it's positive that male protagonist was shown in the drawings and whole novel is properly voiced and ""dual-text"" as English & Japanese at same time was an interesting feature to have, but compared to it's length and for those above said reasons I would've hoped bit more detailed animations or more different art to fill that gap of longing something more.KARAKARA is good novel to players who haven't read much visual novels so far, but for one seeking a fluent, heartwarming story more than abundant figures I would recommend to think another time. It might be a wonderful novel for you, or not - you're the one to make that decision of getting it."

Like...KARAKARA.Granted there are surely more VNs that explore this, but those plebs don't have Animal Ears, amirite?StoryLet's start things of with probably the shakiest part of the Package, in context of the ""Plot"" this genre is embracing, the Post-Apocalyptic part of it is not really fully exploited, aside from that, it's better to look at this as more like a Slice of Life VN with a slight pinch of Fuᴄked up Post-Apocalyptic human-animal breeds, overall,Average.WritingThings start picking up from here, for as half-aѕѕed as the Post-Apocalyptic plot device is, the Writing consistenly has pretty entertaining character interaction and decent mood adaptability,Well done guys.CastIn both respects of Main Characters and Supporting/Secondary/Filler Chars, its pretty limited, 3 and 1 respectively, is not bad by any means though, all three Main Chars have unique personalities and traits (You go call them Cliche all u want boi),Two are company, but Three are just enough to keep it cool.GraphicsIn short,Polish up to the aѕѕ, backgrounds are delightfully detailed with smooth colors, the detail is good, and the color makes it easy on the eyes, but you didn't come for that blunt stalling, you came here to know how succulent the VN Waifus are drawn, rite?It's interesting, compared to the Backgrounds, dem Waifus sport pretty strong and well-defined, theming colors, it makes them pop-out a great deal.Oh, and they also look scrumptious, most definitely.SoundtraxHit and miss, Certain pieces likeCalm Days, PrankandHappy Daysare catchy and chill asf, but most of the rest are atmospheric, borderline forgettable music, the Music count is also not that big, it's not a problem by any means, but it works when it's supposed to, so it gets a pass from moi.DurationHere we take a slip off the rocky cliff, a normal trek though the game should take 3 or 4 hours at most, should you be a horny little bugger like me and download the fabled+18patch and shove it into the game files, you could get one extra hour, is still rather short in hind-sight, for its price tag is not that bad, but get it On Sale in case you are not sure.tl;drIn conclusion, while rough around some edges, being the misleading synopsis and the basic no-progression Slice of Life quirk,KARAKARA is still a pretty solid VN all-around, give this one a shot Moe goodness and VN fans alike,a very fun little distraction at its best, completely harmless at its worst, and you guys need some ""Research material"" until Nekopara Vol. 3 arrives rite?Judge lest be judged, I shalt grant this VN the magistral...PopcornsandTissues/10no but srsly, get that +18 Patch, who doesn't want to get kinky with their cute little anthro companions?"
,Not Recommended,487430,24701781,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Dr. Blue,"Steam really needs to let reviewers specify ""mixed"" or ""neutral"" in their recommendations for games like this.First the good, the art is excellent and the game is fairly well voice acted. The experiment with putting both the Japanese and English text on screen at the same time was inetersting, and I'm glad that experimentations like this...even though I don't really feel that it worked; it was distracting and I turned it off about 10 minutes in. The music is pretty good, though there isn't much variety.The story doesn't really feel like it forms a cohesive whole, and if you perform even the most cursory poking at the backstory, everything falls apart. The largest human settlement has 2,000 people in it...and yet, the American continent still has international trade with the Japanese isles. ""Sagami Fancisco"" has 2,000 people in it and the main character owns a car(!!!). That's nowhere near enough people to maintain a petrochemical industry, or any sort of manufacturing base that could support an auto industry. Even weirder, the main character (or at least his parents) chose to set up a dinner 50 miles outside of the nearest human settlement. And they still...get buisness?""But it's moe! You aren't supposed to take it seriously!""I am totally on board with that! Really! The problem is that the game puts its setting front and center, again and again, at the expense of the moe characters. Nekopara mumbled ""something something genetic enginering, now stop asking about it,"" and then never brought it up again so we could enjoy the catgirls in peace, without bringing up things that would break immersion.And despite that criticism, when the world takes a back seat to the character interaction between Lucia and Aisia and the MC, it sorta works. Which sucks, because you then have the other half of the story dragging the moe character interaction down."

Main protagonist running a restaurant together with an extremely cute puppygirl employee. Your heart goes ""fuwa-fuwa mofuu-mofuu"" along with the story.Everything is sooo cute. ≧◡≦There's a shocking plot twist too.（　ﾟДﾟ）The length of the story is the biggest disappointment, I must say. If this was an anime, this could be a 24 episodes anime, but it turns out to be having only 12 episodes. The climax happens at episode 11, and there goes the anti-climax ending. I was expecting more to happen after that climax.And I didn't realize that I have finished the game until it returns to the main menu. =0=GameplayThere is no selection to be made, hence there is only one ending.Press spacebar to progress, F9 to repeat kiut voices occasionally, F12 to screenshot something kiut too.Personally, I find the game enjoyable and I never skip a single voice line.CharacersCharacter design isabsolutely LOVELY.Lucia is love.There's only a bit of character development since the story is short.VisualAlthough the character sprites are not animated as in Nekopara, they are still lively with smooth face transition and sprites movement. The detailed face expression is also worth mentioning. Background art is filled with details but is not so visual-stunning.AudioPerfect voicing of characters. All female characters are fully voiced. Personally, I really respect every voice actresses behind each of the character.OP and ED song is only average in my opinion.Overall 7/10I would recommend it only when it is on steam sale.

76561198102732128,Recommended,487430,24137046,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Chamaeleonx (˳˘ ɜ˘)˳ ♬♪,"As of writing this review my playtime is low but I played it outside of Steam and therefore havent racked up hours on Steam. This game caught my eye due to the animal/human characters, which I really like. The artstyle is amazing too, there is so much detail and it matches the theme of the Visual Novel.The bright colours, the aerie, almost haunting music pieces of piano music underline the theme of dystopian future. You can almost feel the heat in those bright colour shots, as if the sunlight flows out of the pictures. The story told here comes to life with the wonderful voice acting and above mentioned music pieces.The story itself is a little tale of two (three) people that give each other comfort in these vast lands. The peace of those two living in a mutual releationship gets disrupted by a third one, which tries its hardes to fit in.I will be honest, I enjoyed the story and playing the All-Ages version on Steam doesnt take anything away from the story. I myself played the 18+ version with the erotic content, which might offer a deeper insight in their relationships. For those that expect some hardcore action or anything you will be disappointed, it matches the flow/tone of the novel to have light erotic content.As said before, the audio is a great positive point. The piano pieces with the occasionally track with more instruments matches the vast and empty lands where the visual novel plays.I often found myself wondering if some tragedy would befall them, often trying to assure myself that this isnt that kind of visual novel even if some mystery sprouts up. I really enjoyed that and thus cared for the characters.Some critize the gametime of this title, but for 10 Euro (brought it on sale at release (20% discount)) I got more then enough of my moneys worth. The great art, audio and good story are worth the price in my opinion. I always remember, going to the cinema costs the same for roughly 2 hours without food and you cant rewatch it. I certainly will replay the story a little down the line when I forgot some of it (especially one of the mysteries in it).Its kinda bittersweet with the desolated world and the sweet relationships.Now, obviously I still have a few things I find negative or rather I long for them like those in the novel.Firstly, I would love to stay longer in this universe, explore more about the story, how the world came to be, how the three will master new situations (e.g. children) and how their relationships grow. At the same time, I dont really want much hardcore drama like death and stuff, I wouldnt like that... . Because the three, especially the girls are so frail.... .This doesnt mean it was to short, I just want more of the characters and hope for a sequel.My other point would be, as a Nekopara player, I would like more elaborate or rather higher quality erotic scenes, especially if they fit into the story. Higher quality in a sence of animation and drawn art, not that the art is bad, just more variations in the same way as you animate, more small steps to make the characters become more alive. That would elevate the erotic scenes more.Now, can I recommend the game?I totally can and hope for a sequel!Even the All-Ages version should be great as the erotic scenes rather show a new side of their relationship then dictate the story.For a Kickstarter game the art, artstyle, music and story is great.Message for the developer, build onto that! Just be careful not to destroy the balance of the existing characters."

Just read through to the end.Pretty and colourful, but basic artwork, ok. Story is very typical for this type of thing. Without giving anything away; a normal boy is 'freak'. Everyone else has more ears and a tail, parents died, has a loyal work partner/love interest to operate restauraunt, together they find a poor cute little orphan creature = new trainee for shop / love interest.

That isn't to say it is bad, in fact the characters' design were very well done in my opinion, and the CG and soundtrack were all very nice. The problem I found with this VN is the pacing of the story, as well as how long the entire story lasts. I expect KARAKARA to follow the footsteps of something like NEKOPARA, which will probably mean we see new additions to the series. Would I recommend purchasing KARAKARA? Yes, but I'd probably wait until some sort of sale(I purchased it during its initial lauch on steam so there was a small discount), because for the pricing it has right now, I think it is a bit much. But if you liked NEKOPARA or any other kawaii/moe types of VNs, then by all means go buy it!Pro:-Adorable characters that have cute designs and are well-voiced-CG looks very good-Soundtrack isn't bad-Somewhat interesting twist during the storyCons:-Story was VERY short, they could have added more stuff I feel-If you try out the demo, you essentially know everything about the full game except for a few things.

KARAKARA is a cute visual novel--from the art style (in my opinion of course) to the writing and soundtrack as well. However, for $10, it doesn't offer much.  I say it took me 3 hours, but I was reading exceptionally slow, trying to read it in both English and Japanese (as it displays both languages if you toggle it on). I'll wrap up this review with a recommendation, definitely buy if you want to read a cute little story and support the game devs!EDIT: Turns out this game actually isn't 100% complete, so I'm going to edit this again when I'm done. Currently I've played for 3.6 hours, I estimate around 4 when I'm done."

I really liked the art style, the plot was very good, the characters had good growth throughout the story and were very likable, and even the BGM was really good. There were some english translation errors, only one or two, but that can be expected, and when there were errors it was still easy to tell what was meant to be said. I do really hope that there is a second game made, because I really want to see more of these characters and of what happens next. For anybody unsure of whether or not to get this VN, I highly recommend it to you, and I have already recommended it to some of my close friends. Finaly, I really liked this VN and I hope you like it too."
,Recommended,487430,26669431,"Posted: 18 November, 2016",all,StrangeOne101,"Karakara!SummaryKarakara is a nice kinetic novel based in a post-apocalyptic world where two people are making their living by doing the best they can to run a diner. Civilisation is barely holding up and is only being supported by technology that lost in time, while the biggest of cities on earth only numbering in the thousands. Humanity has taken a massive hit and is very different to what it was in the past.The novel itself is about how the characters go about in their day to day lifestyles and what it's like to survive in a world very much warped from their own. And one day, they bump into a girl on the side of the road and their lives suddenly become rather ""interesting"".BackstoryThe backstory on this game was just through the roof! The whole ""post-apocalyptic"" part had actually been thoroughly thought about in such a creative way and was put together very well! It is very vague on what actually happened in the previous era but seeing how they crafted civilization to only be half standing on the remains of their ancestors was something that really drew you in. For example, civilisation still relied on things like electricity and radio stations but had no idea how they actually worked, as all the information on the technology was lost during ""the incident"". So once something was broken, it was broken for good. I found this really clear and absolutely loved this part of the story! 8/10.ArtThe art in this game is just AMAZING! If you can't tell from the screenshots, it really is incredible. All the CGs were done very nicely and the characters are just drawn BEAUTIFULLY! The only thing that annoyed me is Leon smiles too hard in some of the CGs, but the small details really don't matter when the art overall is amazing. 10/10.MusicThe music in this game is very nice and suits everything very well. It's that sort of thing that you'll happily listen to without realising it because it just merged with the scene so well. Only thing that annoyed me is it can change a littletooquickly sometimes. But apart from that, I would happily buy the OST for this if it were available since it's nothing but pleasant to listen to! 8/10CharactersThe characters are Karakara nice but they aren't anything to hoot over, sadly. They all had their ups and downs, but no matter what anyone says - Lucia will always be the best (Why wasn't there more of her, developers?!?). I found that Leon, the character you play as, was a bit dull and didn't have much personality. I also think Aisia should have shown more emotion at times, given the kind of extraverted character she was. Didn't quite feel natural for her to be smiling all the time. Overall though, the characters are nice and certainly aren't anything to complain about. 6/10.StoryFar too short :( The story was very nice and did have it's good (although predictable) turns of events. But it was just FAR. TOO. SHORT. With the amazingly creative backstory they could have done so so so, so much more with it. I finished the game in around 3 hours, so I was really disappointed in how short it was compared to the potential it had. Apart from that, I did feel the story was a little to focuses around Aisia but the story is still a really nice to read though, and I certainly enjoyed it. 7/10TL;DROverall it is a VERY nice story and the art is just AMAZING. Definitely a nice read for beginners or anyone that wants a nice paced story that has a lot of flavour. It's just sad there's just so little of it ;(Do recommend for anyone who loves the Visual Novel genre though. You'll definitely enjoy it."

,Recommended,487430,29110911,Posted: 8 January,all,Shrouded Wolf,"Being one of my purchases on little more than a whim (50% off for the game, 50% off for the un-patch via Denpasoft), this was a neat little experience. It's short, lighthearted, and sweet. It doesn't exactly expore anything deep, being essentially a few days in the life of the characters as they are running a diner in the middle of nowhere, but it was enjoyable.What I found to be most interesting about it is that it establishes a universe that, while it doesn't delve extensively into, but leaves a lot of potential. For instance, if another VN came out that addressed more things going on in the lives of and events surrounding the same characters or, perhaps, delving more into the catastrophe that took place some time before the events of this game, I'd be interested in having a look at that.Depending on what you're looking for in a VN, I may be a tad hesitant to recommend this at full price, but on a sale? I'd recommend it. The experience is a bit brief and characters aren't complex, but it'll leave you with a smile...and, perhaps, even hoping for a sequel."

,Recommended,487430,28677969,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Totally not Kelkel.,"It is a cute visual novel with cute characters living in the post apocalypstic world where most people got animal ears and tails to make them cute.The only ""Sexual Content"" and ""Nudity"" in the game (that was not cut) is two towel covered female bodies, so I would personally call this a pretty safe to read novel.Sadly its short though."

Play this if you liked the Nekopara series. I would recommend this to a first time VN reader.KARAKARA is a short visual novel with approximately 3 hours' reading time. There are no choices to make. The developers are called ""calme"", and that fits perfectly with this VN -- it is a very calming, relaxing, and enjoyable read.It is set some time in the distant future, where ""normal"" humans are mainly gone from the picture, replaced instead with people that possess four ears, and, occasionally, a tail. The premise does require to suspend your disbelief, admittedly, but it's a little more believable than Nekopara's ""catgirls are a subservient race"" shtick.The artwork is very pretty and of high quality. Each important character -- Aisia, Cullen, and Lucia -- have different expressions and poses depending on the context and even throughout a single line of speech. The CGs are also very nice, though the characters can occasionally look a little odd due to anatomy.The soundtrack is very calming and was a fitting accompaniment to the visual novel. It never felt annoying or out of place.KARAKARA's plot is mostly character-driven; we watch the characters interact and move the story forward. The characters themselves are all very likable. The main character you play as, Leon, is actually very likable as a lead. He doesn't come across as overly incompetent or brutish -- he's just a nice guy. Cullen, Lucia, and Aisia are all very distinct from one another and fun to read about. One of them was even a little surprising.Overall, KARAKARA is a sweet slice of life novel, and I'll be looking forward to the  sequel. However, given its short reading time, I would recommend getting it on sale as opposed to at full price."
