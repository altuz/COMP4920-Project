,Recommended,487700,34429091,Posted: 22 August,all,ben,"The greatest videogame ever made.Easily the pinnacle of computational power, and unquestionably of all human achievement.A monumental artifact of raw and unrelenting emotion, Conan the Mighty Pig reminds us what it is truly like to be human."

Okay, I guess.- Is kind of relaxing, but just the music.- There are trading cards, so you if you like those, they are there.CONS:- Game is frustrating, you can jump off somewhere and never be able to get back without quitting out.- It's made in Flash, and is free on Kongregate.- Locked to 4:3, 30FPS- Constant reminder that the YouTube Flash API has been depreciated in the bottom left.I can see how you might be able to get enjoyment from this, but most regular people won't.If you really wanna play this, it's free on Kongregate.Spend your 79 pence elsewhere."

Hands down one of the best games I've purchased here on steam. Avoiding simple things to reach a common goal is very difficult, but with the repetitive, relaxing soundtrack in the backgroung, things like that will no bring me down. This game represents the highest level achieved in modern PC gaming. The end. I recommend this to all of my friends and fellow PC gamers, it's coming from me, you will not regret your purchase."

Even if I wanted to keep playing I can't becuase early on I walked into a small alcove with a behive. When I walk past them, the bees home in on me, which prevents me from moving. I can press the R key to restart, but I still have to walk past the bees to leave the alcove, and of course I can't because the bees will return.The controls and physics are terrible too. In some spots you have to jump while crouching. Jumping is the W key or the up arrow, and crouching is the S key or the down arrow. Right now, try pressing W and S or up and down simultaneoudly with the same finger, It's one of the few games I've played where a bad control scheme makes it physically uncomfortable to play. The graphics are bland and low resolution. I'm no graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but bad graphics can be the first red flag to show that the developers were lazy, incompetent, or both when creating the game. This continues into the music. The background music is more bland and forgettable than that of your average MCU movie.This game is dumb, don't buy it."

But for now, I'm gonna assume that you've made games prior to this.Before I start, I wanna summerize my feelings about this game:IT'S SO BORINGI haven't even gotten that far. I just don't have the motivation to collect all these random things that don't do anything. I guess the power-up system is pretty good, where you have to scavenge around and look for things to eat. Besides that it's just so BORING.This probably did take a lot of effort, but maybe in the sequel you can make it more fast paced, and maybe collecting the Truffles can make you more powerful, which allows you to fight tougher enemies, where you can get more Truffles. Also, please give the game more direction so you don't wander around aimlessly."

The story of the game will immediately capture your attention while you trot along collecting truffles. Man what a time to be alive. Conan forever.

,Recommended,487700,24216047,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,The Robbie Rotten Of Tadley,After 10 minutes of playing this game I am intrigued. I really like the animal designs. I also like the fact that nothing can really hurt you. This might make the player feel like there isn't a point to playing the game because the fact that you can't lose lives in this game. However so far I really like this; the gameplay is basic but it works. Another thing I like is that you can travel through places within a matter of seconds! From the forest to the beach? You got it. Conan will take you there!The only thing I would say that I don't like is that there's only one music track that loops constantly. If they have given us a couple of other soothing relaxing tracks then it would add more variety.Other than that. For under 1 pound you can't go wrong. I suggest you give it a try although in my opinion it's a 'harder than anticipated' game.

76561198133618483,Recommended,487700,33510836,Posted: 13 July,all,Woooolf™,"Conan the mighty pig’s sheer freedom and sense of adventure is a remarkable achievement. Right from the start, the vast landscape of the Heart of the Forest is thrown completely open to you, and it constantly finds ways to pique your curiosity with mysterious plants, complex hidden truffles, and enemy camps to raid for truffles and plants. The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Conan the mighty pig’s systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive. I’ve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I’m in awe of the scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in."
