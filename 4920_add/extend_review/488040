It is fast and does not slow down very much at all. With others, opening my web browser would lag them quite bad. I got into the habit of closing my eyes while waiting for the browser to finsih loading. No such problems in LightVR. So far LightVR is the only Virtual Desktop that I think I will actually be able to do work in. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a virtual desktop on their HMD."
76561197971949650,Recommended,488040,30359378,Posted: 6 March,all,Solo,"I have been using VR Toolbox increasingly over the last few months.  I bought a Vive, specifically so that I could have a VR monitor over a conventional monitor.  Because of VR Toolbox, formally called, VR Light, my expecations are being exceeded.I tried them all, including Virtual Desktop.  I found VR Toolbox to provide a number of advantages, above and beyond my basic need.First and foremost, I am visually impaired.  Large monitors don't really work for me any more, as I must use fix-focus glasses.  VR Toolbox renders a clear display at any size and position that suits me.  And the developer is SO helpful.  When he heard from me and understood that I have low-vision issues, including a problem with light sensitivity, he turned around and added post-processing features.  So, now I can filter out the light that harms my eyes (you can call it a customizable nigh-mode that does not require Flux.Another really cool thing about this product is that it allows me to virtually overlap my bedroom office with props that act as visual boundaries, instead of relying on chaperone to keep me from running into things.  When I lay on my virtual bed, I am confident that my real bed is in that location.  And since I have boundaries like the back of a couch overlooking a window of a great forest, I get a better view than the wall that's actually where the virtual couch is located.  Since I work at my desktop for hours at a time, it is refreshing to look and walk around such a sceneic and large virtual bedroom.Past where another physical wall is located is a large living area, where I placed a 2nd LARGE screen connected to YouTube.  As I sit at my computer, I listen and occasionally look past my bed to watch my 16' (yes, foot, not inch) YouTube TV.  Sometimes, I get up and go lay across my virtual bed to watch it more closely.This is all so much more ideal than I can put into words but, not only has this product become a game changer for my visual adaptive technology needs, it has become a new way of life in my bedroom / office.  I am so pleased.My hats off to the developer and thanks to him for his passion to make this product work well for someone like me with low vision.  I wish that I could give it more than a thumbs up!I plan to make a video soon of what I described.  I'll come back here and post a link when it is complete.By the way, I have an Aurora R6 decked out and with a NVidia 1080.  The graphics rendered by this application on my hardware is tremendous and thus overwhelmingly satisfying.  However, I was running until last month on an Alienware X51 with a NVidia 970.  Graphics were turned don't a little bit, but it still looked great and it worked!Take the time to try this app and support its development.  Interact with the developer.  He's really out there and listens."

I love the Keyboard glance and the way you can customize the screens and environment.The 1 thing I wish is that the dev puts an optional VR Keyboard in the App.. I realize that this is geared toward mouse and keyboard interaction but it would be nice to pop in and out of LightVR and not have to go sit down.
76561198006688945,Recommended,488040,31480872,Posted: 1 May,all,Bearfight,"HIGHLY RECOMENDEDI'll make this even more detailed soon.  Wanted to get a thumbs up on record though... best of the VR desktops IMO.I'll use the app ""bigscreen"" as a punching-bag for comparison's sake.  VR Toolbox is more resource-friendly than bigscreen and other desktop sims, even as you surround yourself with unique windows and adjust them with full 360 freedom.  Touch manipulation feels light and easy compared to bigscreen's limited-option, hefty-feeling monitors.  Post-processing is a nice touch and improves visuals notably without oversampling to death ... but you can do that too (I do both - looks great and very legible - see my specs at bottom).Developer is very responsive to feedback and implements feature requests when possible.  More features are incoming, so I'll write more when I have had a chance to test them out!   Bottom-line, if you like to surround yourself with browsers, media, etc, this is the app for you.  The interface could use some polish but that's a minor gripe .. the radial menus are useable and issues with controls are more related to the touch controllers sensitivity quirks than the menus themselves.  There's enough flexibility, substance and potential here to make it worth any UI trouble.SPECS:Reviewed using HTC Vive CV, Intel i7 3770K at 4.2GHz and Nvidia GTX980 reference card at 1480Mhz (no cpu or gpu throttle), OS is Windows 10 Pro x64 1703.250.  The OS, SteamVR (beta) and all VR Toolbox content run from SSD.  SteamVR global SS is set to 1.5; in-app SS slider is maxed and in-app FXAA and post effects are on. Three hardware monitors connected (2x 1080p, 1x 1280x1024), also rendering in-app webcam window + chromium browser.  Tested mostly using the ""artdeco"" room preset with most props removed.  Beer-mode (vive built-in cam pass-thru) is usually on."

I really just started to figure out how everything works,  but its so far so good.  Once someone comes up with an effective typing method I could do my work in VR."
76561197976580030,Recommended,488040,31703228,Posted: 12 May,all,Tao Tao,I am still loving this software after putting in nearly 300 hours. The newest update in early May gives you the ability to add virtual screens that display applications. This software is great for art work because you can bring in images as reference and continue to work in your chosen program. It is easily worth more than the asking price. It is the best desktop software for a VR Headset and I have all of the currently available programs offered on Steam that perform this task.The Developer is doing a great job.

,Recommended,488040,30345983,Posted: 5 March,all,YohannfrankfurderIII,"I like this utlity and I belive it is worth the purchase price.I'm mostly interested in this product for the mouse look gaming.That is, uising the vive as a method to look around within a game not designed for VR. Mouse movement emulation.Tested and works very well using the FPV (mouse movement emulation):Skyrim SE (Disable ENB) **3DFallout 4 (Disable ENB)No Man's Sky **Performance (studdering)Space Engineers **3DEmpyrion Glactic Survival (very minor studdering)Marginal (While these do not do well with headtracking, they do run nicely in the main window):Kerbal Space Program **Performance (unplayable signifiant lag, at least in iva)FSX-No head tracking (entire screen moves)Rising World (everything works, cursor is lost on crafting stations)Does not work with:Conan Exiles - DRM? (I suspect you would get the same results with EMB or any injector).ARK -DRM?7D2D - Crashes VR Toolbox and I think Steam VR (does not run at all, window, fullscreen, fpv)**PerformanceI made no special allowances for performance. I ran the games at the settings I would normally run them full AA everything on (unless noted above). I have a GTX1080 but an old AMD Phenom II 965. Overall the performance of this product is very good. In most cases equal to or better than competing products that provide similar functionality (I have 4, a couple at higher price points).**3DUsining ReShade and BlueSkyNight's SuperDepth3D you can setup SBS 3D. This will not work in the First Person head tracking mode but a 3D window pulled up close is VERY nice. Performace is great.Did not try all games with the SuperDepth3D injectors. If noted they work, if not noted, they might.In Skyrim the 3D giant hand problem remains but that has nothing to do with VR Toolbox.General notes: Most game UIs use the edge of the screen, with headtracking enabled you may not see all UI elements unless. A key to auto zoom out would be nice.Much of the manipulation of the windows (moving a window or changing it's size) is accomplished with the vive controlers. While it does work, it's uncomfortable from a seated position."
,Recommended,488040,32531471,Posted: 18 June,all,Chewbacca Offense,"Very good! It's great for viewing Youtube, but I wish I could type into it. I really want to login to my Youtube page.I think it should be called VR Browser because that's what it basically is.I found the drawing part to be laggy and not one to one, it would create scribbles when I tried to draw.The Youtube VR part was pretty great! I got to experience a 3D fractal for the first time in my life in VR, very cool!It's great, I just wish I could access all of Youtube as opposed to just the stuff that's popular and trending. If I have to add something to an import file in settings I'd be cool with that (so I could be logged in to my account)."
76561198347885744,Recommended,488040,28513883,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,ianbart,"This app worked perfectly with Oculus Rift and Touch immediately after downloading--it is great for a ""change of scenery"" for apps stuck in ""desktop view"" land.  In writing this, I have briefly taken the app for a test drive--some notables include a Google Chrome window that appears opened to cute kitten pictures also appears needing to be updated to the newest chrome for security.  I am still figuring out how to resize desktop windows, to find any sort of ""stretch to view"" setting for the Monitor emulation, and if I can resize the separate Chrome browser windows.  The font/typface on the desktop view is slightly fuzzy and small, a magnification/assistive tech-type plugin (like those for vision impared individuals) may do the trick, as maybe a high-contrast setting.  Overall this is an impressive App and is coming along nicely--haven't experienced a noticeable glitch yet.  I would suggest an added setting to allow the hdmi output to be specified (I run dual GeForce 1070s and would prefer display and headset running on separate card, sans-sli for heat dissipative purposes)."

The fact that Virtual Desktop is even allowed to be in the store when VR Toolbox is right here is crazy! The dev behind this project is great and active. The new feature were you can pull apps from your desktop and have them as free standing props is the best,"
,Recommended,488040,30631116,Posted: 20 March,all,TheFatherMind,I really like this app.  I spend hours in it doing my work.  It is difficult to have multiple desktops though.  I would like to have maybe 3.  But having the browsers is pretty cool.  The programmer has put a lot of effort into making this immersive.  He is also responsive.  I reported problems to him and he fixed them right away.  I really liked that.  I also like that you can play 360 videos directly from youtube in this.

76561197965276988,Recommended,488040,35121596,Posted: 21 September,all,ApacheChief,"Highly impressed.Much better than competitors for my needs. Looking for more of a productivity aspect to vr and this one hits it.  Able to display multiple monitors to view stocks, reddit, and cats! While I already have multi monitor set up the ability to split off apps as their own virtual monitor, resize to a 100"" screen, and move it over in 3d space is a very nice plus over my current 4 monitor setup.There still is the Issue of typing. There IS a keyboard in the app in addition to typing on your real keyboard but its not good for anything more than light web surfing at which point Cortana would actually be better.  I feel this will be solved with 3rd party gloves/tracking in years to come or more practically voice to text recognition with a button on the controller.  Tying something like dragon to a button would be amazing but we aren’t quite there yet. Currently have a webcam pointed down at my keyboard and have the webcam showing as its own monitor in the VR world as I look down.  It works but is very lacking because of the lag time with my crappy web cam. If you can type this won’t be much of an issue.In addition to monitors your able to add things in your world that help it overlay with your real room. For example you can place a chair where your actual chair is and a wall is or balcony where your actual wall/bed is. Allowing you to custom build a room with barriers that coincide with the real world. Instead of staring at a wall you can now view Saturn out of your window.As a con splitting apps other than pre-defined ones are hit or miss (this feature is beta) things like discord or Firefox will not split off. While apps like PowerShell and YouTube will. There is also a quick launch menu that have some of these apps pre-defined to split off like reedit, YouTube, and twitch. I Would love the ability to add my own in future Updates such as Discord, Readit, outlook, ect.Overall grate product, well worth the money and has room to grow.  The dev is extremely helpful and active. I Reported an issue with my GPU and he had a beta version to test within 48 hours that fixed the issue! If you’re looking at getting a VR desktop app,  this one might have a slight learning curve, but is definitely worth it."

The window doesn't appear when I start the application and there's no menu option to open it. I read all of the documentation several times and wasn't able to figure out how to get it to appear. The developers offered to help me troubleshoot but I chose not to invest any more time in making it work and instead went with a different, similar application."
,Recommended,488040,32494965,Posted: 16 June,all,Elletram,"Let me start off by saying, that I have tried both Big Screen and Vitrual Desktop. Both of them have great features. No doubt about that. But this VR Desktop, is amazing. I know I havn't even used all the features that is has to offer. But the thing that really stands out to me, is how crisp and clear my desktop is in the headset. I thought it was the limintation of the Oculus headset that made the desktop blurry in the others. But I have come to realize, that it wasn't fully the headset, but the program itself. Just all around great VR Desktop, I can't wait to see what they add next."
