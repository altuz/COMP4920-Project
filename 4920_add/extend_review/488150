Tonight I made it to wave 26 and was sweating like no other!This is truely a mix of Tron discs and Captain America's shield. At about level 15 it starts getting really intense with dodging, shields up, spinning around and throwing your shield.I will say that the controls when launching the disc still don't feel absolute. About 80% of the time I hit my target but there are times when you KNOW you launched correctly and the disc didn't do what you want. Kind of like Wii or Move controllers. When this gets fixed, I will be in heaven.I am really looking forward to where this game goes next! BRAVO!!!!"

You don't gain anything by picking up the early access game which has seen no attention from the dev shortly after it went live. Look at the ""eary access game"" notes from the developer written in June of 2016 and feel free to browse the trello board (http://trello.com/b/oOCNIEaS) listing the tasks he was planning on but never got around to:Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“The game will be in Early Access for at least a month, until it has proper assets (sound, graphics), as well as more content.It's a shame I can't recommend this game; it missed all of its early access milestones. It seems the developer had great ideas to make the game more fun."

Definitely a fun game even this early into Early Access, and it has a ton of potential to be really incredible with future development. Dev is active on Reddit, releases weekly, and keeps a public Trello board with roadmap and progress.As others have said, imagine you're captain America trapped in Tron, and you won't be too far off.Prepare to get a workout, and make sure to wear your wrist straps. Can't wait to see where this one goes."

You can throw it, Captain America style, or use it to reflect drone shots back at themselves (or angle the shield to bounce the shots at other drones). It also takes advantage of Roomscale, allowing you to dodge shots, which slow down slightly when they get close to you.The dev, as well so far, seems fairly responsive, which is another plus in my book."

,Recommended,488150,23924724,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,Astrobia,"Wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the game. Was kind of hoping for something with tron style disc throwing... This is not that but it's still interesting.The disc is basicaly a generic physics object so it's like throwing a lofty brick, not a frisby. It can be quite difficult to aim your throw with it as well due to expectation on how it should behave but I suspect it's something you'll overcome with practice. It's in early access at time of writing so the mechanics might change as well, possibly improved. The system is workable at the moment regardless.What makes it interesting is the ability to call it back to the hand of your choice and getting a score multiplier for hitting enemies that you had previously missed from behind as it returns to your hand. This makes it more dynamic and makes missing a bit less frustraiting as you might have a second shot at taking out the enemy for an even higher reward.While held it acts as a shield and allows you to reflect enemies shots back at them. It was a really nice design choice to make a hud on the shield that it gives you targeting reticle with which to aim shots back. I think this could be expanded in later developement to show player health on the shield and more importantly a radar like feature that shows where enemies are realitive to the direction you are facing so you know when they are charging up for a shot behind you.Basically the game is space pirate trainer with throwable weapon instead of guns. The difference is it is much more reasonably priced for a wave based game and thus gets my recommendation on bang for buck value."

It's fun to play now and I'm looking forward to updates. Nice work so far Dev!Some suggestions.Duel shields.Different enemiesAbility to smash the bad guys when they get too close.Better collision when shield flies into the enemy instead of flying throughA more discs of tron style arenaSome advice to all the wave based arcade style games in development. Please give us players a way to pick our starting level because it gets kind of old to start from level one every time.

Just finished my first game, 23 minutes of action has left me drenched in sweat and with a big grin on my face.  Slow to start but by wave 16 I was constantly ducking and weaving while lobbing my shield like a maniac and laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off.  I refunded holopoint as the constant spinning made me feel sick but the enemies seem to stick to one direction when it gets intense which I think helps.  If you have a vive, buy this now."

Some more enviroments, ene+ies and shield skins would be welcome, perhaps also something to occupy your other hand, but it´s early days still and the Dev has already listened to feedback and provided us with an update, so i´m very hopeful for this game and i can´t wait to see what comes next."

I enjoyed playing it as is for now and already we are getting frequent updates from the developer. Well worth it for under a fiver.UPDATED:  It's been 4 months since any word from the developer despite requests from users in the discussion forums.  This is simply part of the 'great VR cash grab' of 2016.  Avoid and lets not reward this behavior!

,Recommended,488150,24007838,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Mirriky,Dont pass this game up because it lacks shine.I have enjoyed this more than any other arcade shooter on VR (all of which are still incredibly fun) and have very good audio queues(?) so you can react without even looking at the enemy
,Not Recommended,488150,23600901,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,D@weCZ,Not worth 5 EUR. Simple game and boring after few minutes.
,Not Recommended,488150,23629474,"Posted: 18 June, 2016",all,LordDaimos,"Enemies spawn all the way around which makes most of the game just turning around to see where everyone is. Then when you see one you throw your shield at it, which doesn't feel that great. Then you keep turning around and listen for the sound of enemies trying to shoot you. In the end this is just a variant of Space Pirate Trainer which is a much more complete game (even though its also Early Access), both in visuals and gameplay. It might just be worth its low price though even if you get bored after 15 minutes."

Feel like i wasted money cause i dont even enjoy the game, if the demo was out first i would have saved my money.My main issue is its very hard to be accurate, this and any other games that have a frisby style mechanic. Guns np but no matter how much I adjust in a game like this I cant make it accurate. Really wish I had the demo first...Curious if any frisby enthusiasts have played this to hear what they think regarding the physics."

,Recommended,488150,25064753,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,Geos,This game has really become something great! I bought it back when it first came out because the demo seemed promising and I wanted to support the game. Most of the VR games I have backed in such a way have yet to evolve into something awesome but this one has! The audio cues help immensely and everything feels solid with enough depth to keep you coming back. Now that the core gameplay is sweet I can only hope the dev can add in some content to keep things interesting but in any case this is a good investment. If you like active games like holopoint/SPT you try this.
,Recommended,488150,24620070,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,Ronny,Great fun and  quite addictive. Nice to play an arcade shooter type game with no guns. The shield mecanics gives this game a very distinct feel. Good workout as well.
,Recommended,488150,31939732,Posted: 24 May,all,ColeTrain1034,"I love this game! Honestly, it's easier to just throw it like a Frisbee every time. But I get so caught up in it that I'm flinging it all over the place like Captain America and dodging lasers I could easily swat away, just to watch them turn all Matrix-y slow-mo in front of me. It also becomes a nice little work out if you let too many bots stay on the map.My only complaint is that it seems to kind of rollercoaster in difficulty. It's almost as if they really only created difficulty settings for the first 10 waves and it kind of drops back down to easy on wave 11, then increases and drops back down again. So by the time I hit wave 11 I had my strategy and never really had to change much.Either way, this is one of those games that I can play when I'm not in the mood for anything else, and it's always fun. Definitely worth the memory space."

76561198020445786,Not Recommended,488150,32164197,Posted: 3 June,all,M1ng0J1ng0,"6.0 out of 10I really like this game, it's barebones indeed but what it offers is high intensity action sort of like a tron version of Holopoint. You'll get sweaty and your throwing arm will tire so it's a great title to burn a few calories while being distracted. There's skill required so it feels rewarding getting addional points for accuracy and completing waves. The visuals are good enough and the physics feel realistic.However the title remains in EA without an update since July 2016, so consider this game abandoned by the developer so I'm giving a thumbs down as warning. What you're getting should be considered the complete game. With that said I'd still consider the gameplay worth £3.99 in it's current state, but loathed to recommend since the developer has effectively put two fingers up at us."

Fun , but might not be worth $5 now as there is no reason to go back to it after you got a high score or two.  Online leaderboards aren't shown in the game itself , you have look at them here -->http://steamcommunity.com/app/488150/discussions/0/351659808497694953/*This game is a hell of a workout :)  Starts of relatively slow , but come wave 25 or so and it's just pure madness.In this game you throw a shield using either your left or right hand at small flying robots that shoot back at you if you don't clear them quick enough.  You are able to reflect the shots back at them with your shield.  Every shield throw and reflect has to be absolutely perfect if you want to hit something , which can be a little frustrating at times , but sure is a great challenge that I'm sure I'll get better at the more I play.Overall great intense game that gets the blood flowing quickly."
