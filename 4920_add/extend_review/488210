Don't use licensed logos such as Billabong, Sony and Subway to sell your product. That's before we talk about car stuff, including WRC..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7AI8U-NNYA[review]Hold up, press shift, x4. win. Receive some change. Do this 10+ times to 'level up' for bonus cash. No ranks or leaderboards. Most 'licensed' cars and parts cost too much and require higher levels.

This game needs more cars, more body, rim, spoiler and hood customization as well as being able to set the AI difficulty and a test track section to test your tune setup."

Last game like this I played was about 8 years earlier... And it was better then this one.I really don't recommand this game , even for a little 0.75$"
,Not Recommended,488210,23530946,"Posted: 12 June, 2016",all,DeadPoolX,"JDM Tuner Racing reminds me of a Flash game, and there's apparently a reason for that. According to other gamers who've bought this game, it's virtually identical to Drag Racer v3.Normally, I wouldn't fault a game for seeming similar to another, especially since there's only so many ways to design a game within the same genre. That said, JDMTR provides nothing new or of any value beyond the free Flash game that apparently inspired it.The basic concept behind JDMTR is illegal racing where you take normal cars, modify them way beyond the manufacturer's specifications (which is dangerous in real life) while adding various bits of ridiculous design elements, such as an overly large spoiler.That alone would make for a fine game (and in fact, it's worked in other games), but JDMTR breaks down immediately once you start playing it.How so? Allow me to explain...There is NO documentation, tutorial, or any instructions/guides whatsoever. The game itself isn't difficult to play, but many features within it — such as knowing how to fine tune your gear shift — or explaining certain acronyms (i.e. NOS) and initialisms (i.e. RPM) are left entirely up to the player to figure out.The menu system is confusing and clunky to use. For instance, there's a section entitled ""setup,"" which most gamers will assume means ""this is the options menu."" Not so in JDMTR. This section lets you tune your gear shift, but like I explained before, offers no guidance on what any of it means or how it works.The money you earn while playing lets you purchase new vehicles and upgrade components. The problem with this is there's no ""undo"" function.Some people might say, ""There's a downgrade option to solve this!""Well, yes and no. Downgrading will get rid of the last upgrade you bought and installed; however, it won't refund any of the money you spent, so downgrading leaves you worse off than before.The graphics are passable, but static and look at least a decade out of date, if not more so. Honestly, the graphics in JDMTR are the least of its issues, which doesn't say much for it.The actual gameplay is extremely limited and as far as I can tell, is entirely keyboard-only except for navigating the menus, which uses the mouse.Racing consists of pushing ""up"" on the arrow keys, while ""left shift"" will shift into a higher gear (oddly enough, you can't downshift) and the ""alt"" key will fire NOS. Aside from clicking on menus, that's all the gameplay present in JDMTR.Now to be fair, there is a positive to JDMTR: It's incredibly cheap (normally priced at 99 cents USD, and I got it on sale for 69 cents USD) so at absolute worst, you've wasted one solitary dollar. You can't buy anything for a dollar nowadays, not even a cup of coffee or a bottle of soda.So would I recommend JDM Tuner Racing? Absolutely not. Save yourself some money and go play the free Flash game version instead."
