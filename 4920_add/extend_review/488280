,Recommended,488280,23545395,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,Wheellock,Game tries to rely on lame character references and yet succeeds in spite of it by having actually entertaining gameplay. Worth the 60 cents. Probably even worth 99 cents. Would be woth more if they had a version with fun original characters instead of that guy from One Punch Man and the cast of Django Unchained. Buy it for your friends if they're really into clicking a bunch of times in different ways but are not good enough friends to deserve something even clickier.I will play more and since it is only 7mb it is probably going to be one of the few games with a permanent place on my hard drive as I actually really enjoy the gameplay as a time waster.

( go to youtube to know how to win IF ! there is a video BUT i didn't check )- the achivment are hard as hell espicially it tells you "" get the reaction time under or exactly 0.01 sec "" 0o0 wha ??- this game is repetitive some time you get the same duels- you need 50 GOLD to enter the torumment duel  ( get out of here that take too long to get them ) each win will only give 1 or 2 piece gold ( as far as i know that i earned )- at least make us pay per torument like 10 for easy 25 for medium 50 GOD HARD MODE UNDER!! 0.01 SECONDS!!!!! ( more drama in this sentence )- there is 1 guy working by himself no hate to the guy that he made this simple game but at least give us a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story like a 5 year old making it PERFECT EXAMPLE ( love this show ) : AXE COP go watch it I PERSONALLY recommend it (a five year old is making the story line i loved it )- this game is free on the google app store ( i just made a little research just know how many people were making this game no number but i can't say 100% it only 1 guy working on this game cudos to him for making and self publishing).-the game will feel boring in 30 mins ( that how i feel ).-there are some character like zoror or ONNNNE PUUUUUUUNCH [ THEME SONG FOR ONE PUNCH MAN ] and many more if you can win at least once in the touremmentthat about it excluding the guns there all the same BUT diffrent sound effects that all i have to say under a dollar game. ( wow all this review under a dollar in the app store and the game it self dame what i'm i doing to my life )me personally i would get this game in the app store not because it free but there is co-op 1 friend take the other half of the screen and also half of the screen fighting for your reaction time that all and by the way it not all bad i would not recommend this game but hay it your dollar"

It brought about major leaps in technology and laid the groundwork that permitted post-war social changes including the end of European colonialism, the civil rights movement in the United States, and the modern women’s rights movement, as well as the programs for exploring outer space. The primary combatants were the Axis nations (Nazi Germany, Facist Italy, Imperial Japan and their smaller allies) and the Allied nations, led by Britain (and its Commonwealth nations), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. The Allies were the victors. the nazis must have had ADHD because they lost, im a part of the allies because i like camels. im going to go ride a camel.

Although fullscreen mode is available by pressing ALT + ENTER keys there's no way of knowing that other than to be already aware of exisiting Windows shortcut keys and trying them out... Even then, fullscreen mode is broken. On my system entering fullscreen resulted in the whole screen turning white.

,Not Recommended,488280,35060033,Posted: 19 September,all,Verdantil,Tags: Casual - Twitch - ShooterAdditional Tags: Candidate for Library RemovalTLDR: Limited value firmly restricted to the casual twitch shooting genre. Mostly on account of the fact that I want to replace Crazy Chickens series with something eventually and am on the lookout for little clicker games of this variety.Does not fullscreen correctly. No Xbox360 pad support. Limited audiovisual assets. Mechanically the game presents as a series of minigames with the rules shown up at the beginning. They are not equally as fun or as intuitive and probably should had been streamlined and redesigned. Without a pad support the 1v1 experience is seriously offputting as you share a keyboard.  Would seriously recommend this instead for the couch experiencehttp://store.steampowered.com/app/377360/Western_Press/
