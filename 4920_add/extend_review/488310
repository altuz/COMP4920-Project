The physics are spot on and the AI plays as well as you expect.  (PLEASE dont nerf world class, I STRIVE to beat it!)  Its a little low on content but so is a normal ping pong table..   If you enjoy ping pong, tennis, ect buy this.BTW Devs, just a thought but one of the things ive been doing to increase my enjoyment is to only allow myself to play through the ranks to world class.  I start at amateur trying to progress to world class and if I lose I start back at amateur.   I cant imagine it could be too hard to impliment something like this as a starter career mode or a playoff ladder.  I would LOVE to see a torney mode where you progress to win the championship!"
,Recommended,488310,28794988,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Cendaru,"Unlikely killer-app and true ""eSports""Disclaimer:Played with Oculus Rift + Touch, 2-front-facing camera setupI like table tennis in RL. If you don't, this game may not be for you.Before buying this game, I tried VR Sports Challenge from the Touch pre-order bonus. This was fun for 1-2 hours, but never felt like real sports. My expectation when buying Eleven Table Tennis: just another tech demo with unintuitive controls and assists that make every shot magically hit the target.But, what a pleasant surprise: The controller is just a paddle! The buttons have no function.The only control is to swing your paddle against the ball. There are no assists. This is pure physics, the real thing. To make such a direct, raw control scheme is brave because it requires perfect tracking and perfect physics. And to my tremendous delight, both are spot-on. The tracking shows how marvelous the Oculus Touch tracking works (judging from reports of other players, the Vive tracking works equally well). The physics can only be credited to the fantastic work of the developers. Ball and paddle physics are nearly perfect. All kind of spins work as expected. If there are differences to the real world, they are subtle enough to only be noticed by very experienced players.As a sport,Table tennis is a perfect fitto the current generation VR headsets. It requires little room and is played front-facing with minimal movement on the spot. The paddle has comparable size and weight to the motion controller. The ball is small and light enough to make the controller haptics feel realistic. While the player moves his whole body, all movement culminates in the force applied to the paddle and therefore it is adequate to only track the hands.As a result,this game skips the uncanny valley and goes directly to holodeck.After finding the right settings (which is a bit troublesome, see below), the game feels just like playing real table tennis. As someone who likes playing in real life, I can immediately use the play style I already know. And I notice making the same errors.Single Player modeThe setting is a stylish apartment with the ping pong table in the middle. In the left hand you see the Oculus Touch model, in the right hand the paddle. You have no body or arms. The opponent is shown the same way, plus a (somewhat scary) mask for the head that conveys which way he is looking. Each game is basically one set (11 points). The basic rules are enforced by the game.In Singleplayer mode, you play against a surprisingly good and natural AI of several difficuly levels. On the higher levels, the AI starts to apply spin and play faster balls.Additionally there are a few Practice Minigames. For example, in one you must return balls to specific corridors. This game mode as a lot of potential to turn it into a more useful training tool, but feels quite limited at the moment.Multi Player modeIn Multiplayer mode, you can play against a (Steam) friend or random player.A critical point here is the connection quality, especially the ping. In most cases, this worked surprisingly well for me. If the connection is good, there is no noticable difference to the Singleplayer mode. If it is bad, the ball ""jumps"" a bit after the opponent hits, making it harder to react. While the game does everything it can to smooth that out, above a certain lag threshold, the game becomes unplayable.Unfortunately, there is no ranking system yet. Still, to be able to play table tennis against players from all over the world as if in the same room is magical and tremendously fun. The game has voice chat activated by default. Laughing together on funny balls or praising nice shots makes the experience even better (of course not all player use their microphone or speak the same language).SettingsThe most important setting I had to change was the paddle position. For Oculus Touch, the default position is unfortunately tilted. I adjusted it so that when keeping my hand vertically the paddle is also vertically, like a continuation of my hand. The Rift's nose gap is very useful here to AR-like see your own hand and the paddle at the same time.Also there are some settings related to the paddle. I imagine it to be like the choice of the physical rubber properties of the paddle. You can experminent and adjust those to your liking.Wish list for the developersThe raw gameplay is in place and extremly fun. But I think there is a lot of potential to make this game even better. If the developers are reading this, here are my top three wishes:Better Match making: Introduce rankings (visible or hidden). It is no fun for either side if the gap in play strength is big. Also check the connection quality and do not match players if it is too bad.Simplify the settings and provide better default values. Oculus Touch paddle position is tilted, use the correct rotation as default. Instead of sliders give some beginner friendly choices for paddles. Hide the sliders in advanced settings.Bring the game to Oculus Home to reach more Oculus players (Cross-play with Steam!).ConclusionTable tennis is a uniquely suited sports for VR. Eleven Table Tennis provides an incredibly realistic simulation of an olympic sports making it arguably the first true ""eSports"". The Multi Player mode on top of the raw, but near-perfect gameplay provides endless replayability."

The physics take a little getting used to, but I think they are about as good as the best VR games I've played (Pool Nation and Pier Arcade). I would agree with anyone that says ping pong physics are a real tough nut to crack. The resolution is a bit low--I hope the developer gives us a setting to increase resolution scale or whatever. The music is something you'll probably want to turn off (developers let us play our own mp3's, okay?). I say buy it, the price is about right.Update: Wow just a few weeks later and Pong Waves VR has gone from good to great and now one of my favorite games. Totally playable and I have played many games of PR (Physical Reality) ping pong. The two handed serve update is great, AI is better. Physics are predictable and work well as to not get in the way of being immersive. I think that Pong Waves VR qualifies as a competent simulation in addition to a great and fun game. Really this game is a steal at the current price and I highly recommend you purchase now."

I have over 40 games for my Vive and even though it's such a simple concept, this is my favorite.  I have played A LOT of table tennis over the years, and actually competed in some pretty big competitions at an Ivy League school with players from around the world, and this game is SPOT ON!  Just wow.  I want to share a few improvements/suggestions only because I'm such a big fan, that I want the options to continue to evolve (please!).  Do not take these as too critical, as my overall rating on this game is 10/10, A+++.1.  There seems to be an issue during ""waves"" mini-game, that the ball is mistakenly shot into the net or off the table and there is no way to retrieve the ball.  It's easy to abandon that game and start a new one, but a bit annoying, and maybe fixable?  It would be frustrating if this happened during a record-breaking run!2.  I'd love to see high-scores for the mini-games, even if just local scores.  Most of us are very competitive and want to have high scores to beat or compete with others in our household.3.  Add another vote to the ""locked"" table height, using the floor calibration to determine and set.  As many of us are sticklers for consistency, it would be nice to know the height is the same every time.4.  Any way to have a multiplayer lobby?  Maybe even a self-rating of sorts that could indicate which level you've beaten within the game to separate players?***5.  And most importantly (unless I missed a setting), can you add a setting of matches to 21 points?  Especially for multiplayer?  And even consider adding a Best of 3, Best of 5 option?  Prior to 2001, games to 21 were the normal, and some of us still like to casually play that way, even if it's not the International standard any longer.Again, KUDOS!  I absolutely love the gameplay and I can't stop telling all of my friends about how much fun and realistic your game is!"

,Recommended,488310,25170360,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,Qix,"It's table tennis, pure and simple. The game puts you in front of the table, you pick up the bat and ball, and you are playing. It seems quite close to the real thing. The main drawback is the controller feels different to a table tennis bat handle, but it passes for one quite well, especially if you go into the options and angle the bat to your preference.At the time of review, the game is still in early access. As such, I think the AI needs a bit more development. The computer opponent seems to find it impossible to counter shots close to the edge of the table, but has no problem with ones close to the net. Who wins is determined by whether you ace your own serves or fail to return the AI's. The computer opponent is almost infallible in its ability to keep the ball on the table, even on the easiest difficulty setting. Of course, multiplayer adds the element of spontaneity missing from single player mode, but I lost patience waiting for a human opponent after only a few seconds because there's nothing else to do while waiting. You can't even throw ping-pong balls out of the open window. Trailing wires and lack of space made moving quickly to the left and right a bit risky for me and so I spent the whole game rooted to the spot.I have to say, this is a really good use of VR and I think this has the makings of a great game. Even in early access, it's very good. As someone who enjoys table tennis, I can say it is about as close as I can imagine table tennis simulations getting without a table tennis bat shaped controller."

If I try to put to much spin on the ball it either misses the paddle entirely or the ball flies off in a random direction.The immersion is great and the environment is good enough that I often have to stop myself from putting the paddle down on the table when i stop, but I'm giving it a thumbs down just so that quality players know that at least at this stage you will not be able to practice your real game as I thought I might be able to from all the reviews I had read."

Once you tweak the settings around for a while (paddle position / power / spin), it feels almost *exactly* like real ping pong.  I'd recommend the power and spin sliders set to about 1/4 of the max value.  When setting the paddle position relative to the controller, try to line up the palm face of the handle to the palm surface of the controller (top surface underneath the menu button).  I found that mating these two surfaces was critical to emulate the real feel.  If the surface of the controller is at any other angle or position, hitting the ball just feels off.  I was expecting latency to kill multiplayer, but they correct for it pretty well.  Real life ping pong skills transfer 1:1 in the game no matter how janky you hit your shots.

If you add multiplayer I'll buy another vive just for that. The thing I hate about ping pong is having to constantly chase balls after every point and not being able to practice on your own. Well, this sovles all the issues I have with ping pong. So its better than real ping pong. For real.When you hit the ball some how there is a tiny amount of force feedback which makes you think you really hit a ball, and the sounds are perfect as well. (And you can mute the music or sound effects too). All of the physics, ball spin, etc from real ping pong are there. I can't find any difference between it and real ping pong. I'm sure a pro might. I have a hunch that the spin is less than in real life but I could be wrong. Top priority should be multiplayer. I only care about local multiplayer but I'm sure most people will want internet multiplayer. Other possible purely optional enhancements could be options to allow games that go up to 21 points instead of just 10, adjust degree of ball spin.This is my favorite vive game. All of the graphics and fancy acting, etc, sometimes the most fun games are the simplest. IMO this is what smaller vive developers should be concentrating on. Most sports are relatively simple but have stood the test of time. I like it better than a tennis type of game because I don't have to run around and get tired, I can play standing and remaining relatively still.PURE GENIUS THIS GAME AND REASON ENOUGH ALONE TO OWN A VIVE 9/10 (Multiplayer would be a 10).

My favorite games of all time for PC (in no particular order and off the top of my head)  are Diablo 2, Witcher 3, Skyrim, Heroes of Might and Magic, Might and Magic, BF2,and  Mass Effect (all of them). I mention this to give you some insight into the type of gamer I am to give you some perspective on my reviews. At the time of this review, I am a 30 year old white-male. I don't intend the 'white-male' part to change; but who knows. I have been playing table tennis since I was 5. Onto the review for Pong Waves.Prior to the most recent update, I would not recommend. The backhand, my primary weapon, was not even remotely close to realistic. With this most recent update, this game is MUCH closer and I can recommend with some warning -- it is not perfect. It will frustrate you when you mentally know you've hit a solid shot, but it doesn't respond that way. With this most recent update, I would say that 80% of my shots feel realistic. That is good enough for now, for me to enjoy myself and have a spirited game against the AI, or in 'Wave' Mode.AI: The first two difficulties are a cake-walk. The last one, is beastly. I haven't beaten the best setting yet -- ""World Class"", I think. You can easily exploit the first two settings with serves that they will never return. That is a bummer. Once you get to the most difficult setting, it is like you can't get anything past it. This isn't a bad thing per se, but I would like to see some better balancing on the AIWave Mode: Although this is OK, it needs some more content. It is currently setup in a manner where you get 'x' number of balls and you get 100 pts for each that you land on the other side of the table. That's it. I think they need to add an endless mode with a 'strike system'. Three, five, and seven (hard, medium, easy -- respectively?) maybe? Then add a leaderboard. Maybe a progressively more difficult endless mode? Starts of super easy, then progressively gets ridiculous -- sudden death style.Additional modes: Should be an ""accuracy mode"". Maybe there are rings you have to hit the ball through? Or targets, or something.Different Environments: Self explanatoryRPG Elements to add: Add different paddles with different stats that can be unlocked as you level up. Maybe you get stat points as you level up and can augment the following player stats: Power, Accuracy, Spin, others? Maybe add some accessories that you can win in tournaments to augment your stats. Very simple RPG elements would put this game over the top.Playing Against Real Players: Add this feature with the above RPG features and create classes of tournaments: Bronze for players level 1-5, silver for players 6-10, gold for 11-15, etc. That would be a good time.Out of 5, I would give this a 3 right now, with the potential to be a solid 5 if they implement some elements that increase replayability, immersion, and engagement. I recommend this game as it is the only, and thus, the best pong game on the market."

But it is not that far off. After an adjustment period, this feels like playing ping pong.CONS:-Really hard top spin is making the ball go farther down in the air than it should. Makes a lot of your all-out slam shots hit the net until you adjust for the crazy amount of top spin. Could this be fixed with some sort of cap on the spin? Good luck fixing it. haha-Most shots just don't feel like they're going high/far enough, overall. I'm not sure what would cause that, but an experienced ping pong player will easily notice.-No multiplayer. IMO, adding this (along with a ranking system eventually) could be interesting, because people who don't have a ping pong table could compete in a game that is truly not that far off from an IRL ping pong game.PROS:-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of fun. I have a ping pong table in my basement, but rarely have people to play against. This is a great alternative (I'm worried about it affect my IRL ping pong game. I feel I will be able to kinda switch my brain back easily, but this is yet to be seen. Will update after I play some actual ping poing!)-Spin feels pretty damn great. I was pleasantly surprised that for most of my shots, even with complex slice/ cuts with diagonal back spin, the ball acts accordingly. The harder your shot, though, the less accurate it tends to be. Some spins can become very exagerrated because of a really hard cut.I know there are fewer pros, but I implore you to look at the weight of the pros. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is possibly jonesin for some ping pong.PS:stoked for multiplayer. I think it would dramatically increase the gameplay quality, along with a ranking system to feel that legitimate improvement.PPS:If you usually place your index finger on the backhand-side of your paddle, DO THIS in Pong Waves VR. It will greatly help your insticts. This being said, I feel the paddle should be very slightly lowered in the grip. Compare x)the location of your finger being on the back of a real paddle with y) the percieved location of your index finger on the back of the in-game paddle. Seems just barely high.TL;DR:I am the Forrest Gump now."

Buy this game if you enjoy a simple, yet fun design.This game, in theory, is perfect. I really like it, even though I've played it for a bit. The game is fun if you don't count the score. Why? Because serving is broken--atleast for me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong, it's exactly the same as the AI and most other players do the same thing I do. (I hold the ball in the air and hit it as it is falling), but the second it touches the table, my opponent gets a point. The ball bounces and would stay on the table, and the AI returns it, but it still counts as a negative point for me. I understand this game isn't finished, but something as dire as serving is a serious issue. A smaller scale problem is that the AI seems to clip and randomly get a point even though the ball never came to my side. The AI jumps to the left, hits the ball, it disappears, and he jumps back to the middle with a point. It's weird, and this game makes me angry. Hopefully this is fixed and I can give this game a positive review."

,Recommended,488310,29049110,Posted: 5 January,all,Carm,"So good! My personal killer app for VR!The physics are excellent, and the gameplay makes excellent use of 180 degree roomscale setups. I'm playing this with a 2-sensor Oculus Rift setup with 2m x 1.5m play area, which is the minimum recommended area. This is my favorite VR title so far because the gameplay is fun and seems to have a high skill ceiling. Fortunately, lots of VR awkwardness is mitigated thanks simply to the fact that it's table tennis. You don't really have to worry about getting tied in knots, losing trackig due to rotation, or locomotion.Couple of notes that might help:1) If you're using an Oculus Rift, you may start the game with the floor at eye-level. You can fix this by repositioning the table, but you can also just run SteamVR setup, which should configure your height correctly.2) You might need to reposition the table so the edge of the table would be touching your virtual thighs. By default, the table edge seems to be at the front-edge of your play area. That means if you reach in to swing at a ball, you might put your hand through your computer monitor or something. I think serious players stand back quite a bit, but at least on lower difficulty levels, the AI hits short balls often, so you'll often find yourself needing to make swings that are right over the table.3) You'll want to configure your physical-to-virtual control mapping and it's not totally obvious how to do this. Go into settings and then look down at your paddle hand, and you will see that you can adjust paddle position. Wish more games did this!4) It actually took me a little while to figure out that you need to squeeze the trigger of your non-paddle hand to spawn a ball so you can serve. I sat in front of the table staring at my AI opponent for longer than I'd like to admit.Looking forward to the additional environments!"

I haven´t played this one much, but I believe I have to write a review because it´s one of the best VR experiences I have had with the HTC Vive. I played a lot of table tennis before so I knew exactly what to expect and to my surprise, this feels like you were actually playing Table Tennis in real life. The controls feels exactly like a Paddle, it´s really amazing. I started to play with an amateur AI and he did made some stupid mistakes, but if you start to play well, the AI starts to play better. After a while, I played with a Pro and whoaw, it´s the third level in the list of 6 in how hard it is, and let me tell you, it´s hard but so good. He did effects and I´m almost sure I manage to do some effects too but you really have to work hard to do it well, because it´s very realistic (it´s been ages since I played). But depending on how you hit the ball and how hard, the balls reacts like a real ball, it´s really, REALLY realistic.And the feel of the ball, oh, let me tell you about it. I started to play with the paddle and the ball trying to do some equilibrium and I felt the control vibrate every time I touched the ball, like a real paddle!!! I don´t know about the oculus controls but people say they feel great. Well, the Vive controls feel exactly like if you had a paddle in your hand, you just use it EXACTLY like a paddle. And what´s best, you can adjust the position of the table, to the sides, to front or back, to higher or lower, wherever you like, until it´s in the best position. I don´t have much space in my room, like 1,50 x 1,50 if much, I believe lower than that, but as you can move the table, you can adjust very small spaces to play and move without concerning you will hit something.As other reviewer said, buy it only if you like Table tennis, because is that, table Tennis. I haven´t played more because I have back problems so I got a backache the next day, but I just didn´t want to stop, is that good. The mini games are great also, mini games like hit a target with a ball is thrown to you, hit a particular place of the table, hit balls that come from diferente positions and heights. Multiplayer? I don´t know, I didn´t use it so no idea, and you don´t need it, there are levels for the complete beginner to the pros, I didn´t try the hardest because the pro (that as I said was the third one in level of 6 levels)kick my♥♥♥♥♥everytime."

Probably because it (by far) surpasses any other attempt at mimicking an actual real-life activity in a video game. This game FEELS like actual table tennis on a very precise level, and this is also why it is constantly challenging. Lots of things can be improved of course, like:- Ranked multiplayer instead of just random, and/or save preferred players- More AI variation - the Semi Pro and Pro are two very different beasts :)- Better keeping up with rules, e.g I've gotten away with net serves many times. Also I reckon the need to avoid getting hit by the ball in real table tennis? I.e. an overshot ball need to miss the opponent as well as the table in order to count as a point for the opponent. This could get abused though.- More polish in both game and menus. The ultimate would be a ""multiplayer arena"" with multiple tables, where you can play and get up the ranks (physically by moving up tables!), or just watch and cheer on others playing. Also maybe Oculus avatar support?-More players! Maybe this game needs better promotion. I find it incredible that Oculus (or Valve) have not pushed this game since it beats out their own ""AAA"" titles in pure gameplay,There are so many things that could make the experience even better than it's current state, but that said - this is still THE killer app for VR this far in.

But here's some suggestion for you the dear developers :First, no spin ball, no spin ball, no spin ball. In ping pong games, spin is not only make ball tto change the moving path and speed, it make lots of attacking movementt possible, like the fast attack top spin. As a trained semi-pro ping pong player, I feel that with out top spin, most of the right powerful loop will be impossible in this game. With out topspin, the right loop will be too slow to go through the net or to high to catch the table. Chop is the most impotant defend weapon for tennis grip, while loop is the most impotant counter-attack weapon. Abandon the spin makes tennis grip impossible to play, which is the most comfortable grip way for using HTC Controllor;Second, no let in the game. Which means no reserve for the net serve.Third, I know it is almost impossible to make the mass touch feeling for smash on Vive. But after fix the spin ball, can we have the custom paddle? In this systerm, we can custom the out look, most impotantly the rubber. Different rubber has different effect on spin, the stroke speed and so on. That will make this game amazing.Fourth, social network play and multiplay mode.This is my first comment on steam.I'm always too lazy to reply my experience. But for this promising game, I just so love it and tribute my first time.LOL好了，该来一发中文了。这游戏强力推荐，我玩过最好的乒乓游戏，完美模拟了乒乓球的物理轨迹和触感。但最大的毛病是，没有旋球。上旋下旋侧旋拆球都没有。这让拿横板的情何以堪。拉不了球削不了球，神烦- -但是直板要是不旋的话，触感还是非常感人非常棒的，适应时间非常短就能很轻松的像真乒乓一样控制球路。游戏还是早期版本，有些缺失也能谅解。接下来的版本除了旋球外，希望还能加入社交和网络对战，自定义球拍胶面等。到时候这游戏一定屌翻天。强烈推荐"

I haven't tried out the multi player yet...I am not that great so I want to go in at able to beat the second level AI, at minimum. I really like the physics and for the most part it plays great. There are a few bugs. One is when the ball will randomly get stuck close to the AI and they make gestures for me to hurray up and play, but, it is impossible and you have to restart the match.

The table is fully adjustable in both direction and height and the colour can be changed in the settings menu.I can't talk about multiplayer as I can't even beat the AI consistently yet but I see no reason for it to be a bad experience.Really good Table tennis game that I recommend if you have the slightest interest in the game or are just wanting something a bit different from the wave shooters that seem to be prevalent at the moment."

Deceptive in the fact that they cannot begin to capture the immersive experience. This game is a perfect example of this... You look at the screenshot and get the impression the game is very mediocre. I bought it, put my headset on, WOW. For the price, this is a very well put together game. The visuals are very appealing, not only that, the game dynamics are phenomenal. I got exactly what I was after, a fun and entertaining workout. This is almost as close to the real game as you're going to get - kudos to the devs. I'm far from a pro table tennis player and could be wrong, but I've played a few games and this just felt right. My only gripe is that you must hold the Oculus touch controller a bit weirdly to get the bat at the right angle. Maybe a setting to angle the bat would be good so that it fits ""naturally"" in your hand. Not that a touch controller will ever feel like a bat. Overall - this is one of the best value games I purchased to date for my Rift – and I have a big library of games.

The Physics in this game are so much better than other Ping Pong Games avaiable on the Vive. So far as of7/24/16there are only two game modes, Waves and Single Matches. I will also go in depth in the Graphics of the game and in depth in the Game Modes!WavesWaves is a arcadish type game mode that challenges you to hit balls the computer throws at you. This sounds really cool in theory, and it kind of is! However this mode only last for about 1 minute and then it's over.Here are some tips to make this game mode better:Make additional levelsMake an Endless Wave ModeMake a mode where both hands act as paddles so both have to hit incoming ballsSingle MatchesSingle Matches in this game are really what shines in Ping Pong Waves VR. There is lots of Opponent AI difficulties as well! From Ametuer to Legendary this mode will cater to veteran Ping Pong players as well as beginners. This game mode stays true to official Ping Pong rules and is really addicting. I was going to suggest what would make this game mode better but this mode is already good!Graphics/Looks of the gameThe Graphics/Looks of the game is still what reminds me this game is still in early development. Don't get me wrong it doesn't look bad but it still looks like it's a placeholder or something along those lines. The look is very realistic where you are placed in what looks like a Apartment and it's feels really cool to be playing Ping Pong in a place you wouldn't ever play in. there are some weird Graphical Things I will mention now.The Ping Pong Buckets Ping Pong Balls are shadeless and look kind of weird.Most of the TableTop Colors are really bright and can't see any detail on the table with the Black option.The overall lighting feels very plasticy and basic.Overall Ping Pong Waves VR is a very promising title and one I will keep coming back to! I would definitely reccomend people who like Ping Pong or people who haven't ever played a Match in their life! However now I want to give some things I would love to see get implemented into the game in the future!A One hand serve option.More modes. (Tourney Mode, Practice, Multiplayer, ect.)More enviroments. (The Moon, A Rooftop, An Office Building, ect.)More realistic lighting.Make the net on the table Physics based.Make the enviroments interactible, so you can hit objects and it interacts.That's all I could think of.

This is probably really obvious, but it wasn't to me! Duh!I started off holding the bat as I would normally hold the controller. I think your're supposed to hold it with the haptic trackpad to your palm and your index finger on the controller ring. This way, the bat is in the right position and you get the haptic feedback every time you hit the ball.It would also be great to see the score when you finish playing, as I'm usually too engrossed to look at the scoreboard and then suddenly the match is over and I don't know what the final score was. It would be cool if the NPCs had names or something too, that way it would be more emotionally involving when you beat them."

The only other vr ping pong  I've tried is Paddle Up, and this game has the clear edge on realism.I almost want to vote this down, because my one big complaint is the multiplayer. I've had a few incredible matches with people where there was very little lag, and matched quickly. HOWEVER, the normal experience has been to wait for 20 mins not matching with anyone, and only being able to rally with a painfully easy AI. A few lag crashes too.DEVELOPER RECOMMENDATION: Since we have to wait so long in multiplayer queue sometimes, please make it so we can do single player matches and skills games without losing our spot in queue.Single player gameplayI find the AI to be an incredible opponent. I started off not particularly skilled. The lowest difficulty got me good at basic ball control, and now I'm having epic over hand smash rallies on the third difficulty level. Levels 4 and 5 are basically Insanity and Asian. Every shot is a wildly spinning bullet. But more and more I'm returning shots. All flukes for now, but it's happening more often.

I was using this with oculus touch controllers, and while I did have to rotate the grip on the control to orient the paddle correctly, it worked really well.I play ping pong recreationally in my office, last year I think I played everyday on my lunch break. I was able to start playing this game immediatly and start making all the same errors I do in real life. Everything feels right, down to the spin and power on the ball.The AI levels are pretty good, though the jump from amature to semi pro feels too steep, and the legendary AI is not screwing around, which is great.I'm not too happy with the audio on the ball bounces and contact, but this could be improved in the future. There was also no feedback on the touch controllers, not sure if this applies to vive, but either way it could really use a very gentle buzz depending on the type of contact with the ball so you can start having some slight physical feedback.I played only one multiplayer match, but it was too laggy to really play well. The problem here is the game seems to force correct the balls position through the latency, so you can expect the ball to warp around a lot, making play almost impossible. This may not be the case with a better connection though, I saw no ping indicators so I had no way of judging whether that one game was an outlier or not.I also found out how sturd the touch controllers were. The AI gave me a nice high loft that was begging to be spiked back down, and I did, right into my desk shelf. I knocked a chunk of wood off the desk and drew blood, touch controllers in tact, ping pong ball on the floor.10/10 would bleed again."

Ping rate can be an issue from time to time given the speed of ping pong.  I hope to see round-robbin tournaments in the future. If you love Ping Pong, you should buy this and join the community! I also recommend to the developers to create more game-oriented practice devices, like an AI that always serves to your backhand to practice one's technique...or, a CPU that exactly copies your serve so that you can see what an opponent sees.  Oh, and link in Pandora or Spotify on the radio, that would be cool!"

The game settings allows you to adjust the table position, height and the racket angle (I prefer to set in the middle with the HTC Vive controller) - which are all important for the gameplay. The first 30 minutes I could not manage to play an agressive game, but had to play safe with blocks, backspin and counter-loops. Drop shots positioned on the short left and right on the table felt very real, and I really got to put my table tennis experience and reactions to use, last millisecond wrist turns to save the ball was very true to life. Being able to change colour of the table was nice, the graphics are much nicer then any other table tennis game out there. Another reviewer had a nice tip to press Shift when starting the game and select Beautiful graphics.After some time I also got the hang of the drives and managed to play a more agressive game on both forehand and backhand by using actual table tennis techniques (but a bit slowed down from real life). It took some time before owning the legendary 1-player opponent, but I managed at last and worked up a good sweat. This game feels like the real thing!A couple of things can be improved. For example when serving an ace, no point is given but I have to serve again. Spin don't seem to have very much effect on the game. It would be nice to be able to adjust the amount of backspin in a serve or stroke according to speed of movement and point where the ball hits the racket, but maybe the players just need to get some more expensive rubbers or glue up the racket before the game :) Also the training robot could have a forhand / backhand & letter practice mode.Looking forward to following this game and to finding any other players in the multiplayer section!

,Recommended,488310,25656702,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,MrGray,"(Comments here are directed at the 09-22-2016 update.)Having tried this latest update, I have to say I prefer the previous version. Perhaps I just need time to adjust to the new physics. Though I'd still recommend the game, it feels like it's taken a step back.While the increase in difficulty is welcome (even Legendary was cake before), and the introduction of the announcer is nice, there are many new detractors:-The new supposed emphasis on spin seems to have been overdone with respect to back spin while at the same time nearly eliminating the effects of side spin (it's almost impossible to curve the ball like I used to--and can in reality--with a sideways backhand). Back spin is now so strong that the computer opponent often sends serves that appear to travel (and arc) in slow motion (very strange) and die when they hit my side of the table.-The ball seems heavier now in a way that feels unrealistic. More shots end up in the net, yet still if I try to put any real power behind a hit the ball almost invariably ends up going too far. The computer opponent now has no trouble blasting the ball, though (which is nice).-I've had several occasions where I'll return a ball and it'll disappear mid-air above the net, pause a second, reappear seemingly stationary against the computer opponent's paddle and then get fired back at me as if the computer returned it without any of that ever happening.-Were the spawn points in Waves always such highly reflective red chrome? Because Waves was always such a short experience I didn't play it much before. With this update having Infinite Waves, though, I'd like to play it more, but the spawn globes are terribly distracting (a softer matte color and smaller spawning spheres would improve this). Also, the globes are often very high above the table. Like, Magic Johnson reaching up over his head high. Seems a little ridiclulous (and doesn't make for good practice since in-game shots will pretty much never come from those locations).-Sometimes on serves, the loss-of-point buzzer will sound the moment my paddle hits the ball even though the serve goes through cleanly and within the rules/bounds. This also happens to the computer opponent (though less frequently).-Lastly, in spite of having a beefy system (i7-6700k, 32GB RAM, GTX1070, SSD), I'm getting much more sporatic graphical stuttering than in previous versions (this comes in the form of minute pauses, particularly just after the ball leaves a paddle)."
,Recommended,488310,25687159,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,TiG3RMaST3R,"Wow this latest update rocks, the physics is almost perfect now, i do the same errors i usually do on the real table.i had purchased paddle up and ping pong vr too and before this update paddle up had the best physics.In paddle up on its side it's easier to do curved shots, but i've just seen in the options they have added a couple of fader to tune the paddle speed and spin, nice.Multiplayer is ok and it looks it handle latency a bit better than paddle up, i have played with a 100ms ping opponent and it was somewhat playable, obviously not perfect but there's not much they can do with that latency, anything above 40 ms produces visible latency and probably going over 100ms gives unexpected behaviours, the key is how they handle it.EDIT: Played again with a 95 ms opponent in california (i'm in italy) the match was very smooth to be honest, i didn't expected so much quality with a so far connection.i've lost a couple of points where i was sure i did it right, but we played several matches and the overall experience was great.So for the guys that have problems with multiplayer they have probably packet loss due to other factors, like other people using the connection, other programs inside the computer using bandwidth, a low or disturbed wifi signal in case of wifi, or some nodes over the net that have problems (saturated dslam or node for example), if connections are smooth, game is smooth.Remember to serve FAR from the table, if you serve over the table you will lose the point ( i think it's a real table tennis rule)"

The in-game physics is incredibly accurate to the extent that it makes me forget that I'm playing it in VR. The developers have been working really hard on it, regularly tweaking the physics and adding new features, listening to and communicating with us constantly via social media, and even consulted professional table tennis players to improve the physics.Before the latest improvements were added, my other favorite was Paddle Up. But after the devs had added the recent improvements, Eleven Table Tennis VR has now become the only table tennis game that I can recommend confidently with my eyes closed and label it as a 'must-have' if mind-blowing realism and accurate physics are what you are after.This is the first game I launch when I first start up my Vive everyday, even though I've played it for more than 5 hours already. Several gameplay features have been added recently, and numerous bugs have been fixed. The devs have also informed me that they are already working on adding more environments. Multiplayer (with voice, of course) had little to no lag, and I've played with several other players online without any problem whatsoever.The only thing I dislike a little about the game at the moment is the default environment, which looks a bit gloomy for my taste. Hopefully some different ones will be available soon.In conclusion, if you have even a passing interest in table tennis and own a Vive but still haven't bought this game, you have absolutely no idea what you are missing out on. Do yourself a favor and get the game. Also, check out the 'Replay' feature that has been added recently and thank me later!On a scale of 1 to 10, Eleven: Table Tennis VR easily earns a 9.5 from me!

If the ball is going to miss the table, the opponent follows the ball with the bat, then the ball goes through the bat. That should not be allowed to happen, the computer should have to hit it.

Somewhat tranquil, but also intense and satisfying. As you can see, I have quite a few hours put into this game.Starting a few months back, I was suddenly not able to launch the game. Verified game files. Didn't work. Reinstalled. Didn't work. Reinstalled to different SSD. Didn't work. Game updated very recently and now all of a sudden, it does work. Sorta.The game now launches, but I can't play. The ball remains attached to my left hand no matter what I press and none of the game modes do anything whatsoever. No opponents show up in Single Player, no waves start in the mini games. It's so unfortunate, but at this point I'm moving on to hopes that another table tennis game can take over the throne."

I've played a lot of ping pong in my life and this feels pretty accurate, it's not perfect but for an early game in VR, it's solidy.  The physics are pretty darn good.  It is bare bones yes, but it is pretty cheap, so you can't really complain.  If the developers give some more options, it will be a fantastic game for any VR owner.One little complaint I'll make is it seems you can't adjust where the table is in space, so it dictates to you where you stand in your playspace, so it had me pretty much backed to the edge of mine, I'd like the ability to adjust my perspective movement similar to pool nation.

The game is actually very good with a lot of things done right.It took me a while to translate my real world skill to the VR game. Topspin (hitting the ball angled over the ball) seems to be very challenging with the orientation of the controller and in game detection. I couldn't figure out how to consistently put spin on the ball aside from on a serve. (Such as a horizontal or vertical chop when hitting the ball back).Improvements:Real ping pong competition rules. Have to serve behind the table (I can reach over real far and hit the ball from right near the net). To serve, the ball must be thrown 16cm into the air and hit from the air. Implement service lets.One more AI level, one that hits the ball close to you. Currently, even Legendary AI hits the ball and it lands halfway on my side. I can play standing at the table to hit everything back - this is unrealistic.Great job by the developer. I'm looking forward to multiplayer."

There is no way to reset the game, so you need to exit the match and restart. It really screws up the flow of the game.- A more gradual increase in AI difficulty. I have over 20 hours in this game and I can barely ever beat semi-pro.- More environments are said to be on the horizon, I can't wait for that. The ability for user generated backgrounds would be great as well.- More efficient matchmaking.

However,  i played on Oculus Touch and did have a few issues. For exmaple, its really ddifficult and unnatural to hold the touch controller as you would hold a paddle with the right hand, striking with the pal (not the back) of the paddle. the controller just isnt meant to be rotated in that way. this is an example of the vive controller'sbeing more verastile, since its just a stick you can hold however you like. cant do that with the touch controller.Problem number 2 is that even though I have a lrage playing space (12 feet X 10 feet), The default orentation of the game is such that I am always getting close enough to the wall for the chaperone/Guardian syste, to show up which is annoying. If I could rotate the in game world so that the ping pong table matches the longitudinal direction of my room, I will have less problems.  I know th egame allows you to move the table around, but there does not seem to be an option to rotate it. would be very helpful.

If you've ever played table tennis in your life this is a must have: so far it's basically the only ""real life"" sport that is close to being 100% replicated in VR (physics are pretty good!). There are some tiny limitations (failing to hit balls that I definitely would have hit in real life), but it's hard to say whether the game or the 1st gen VR hardware is at fault."

Once (if) this gets multiplayer it's going to be a fine game.2017 update: Well, the game ultimately implemented a multiplayer component and it really does change the dynamic of the game for the better. I can't tell you how cool it is to play a few games against people from all over the world whenever I want. Multiplayer games just feel different in VR. This demo, specifically the multiplayer component, is a great show for VR newbies as it lets them see the craziness of where the technology is.My one gripe, and it is minimal, is that the audio in the multiplayer lags at what appears the be the same lag as the video. 30ms is doable for ping pong, but for having a back and forth conversation it can ruin the natural rythms. Humans are extremely sensitive to speech timing Way in the weeds, I know, but if you play multiplayer and try to have a conversation you will immediately know what I am describing. Seems like a thing other games have fixed or optimized...Buy this game. It's 10 dollars. Play it for two hours. Thank me. Continue playing."

The sound of the ball actually sounds realistic--it's a small detail, but the developers looked at the details. I'd say that the only issue I'd complain about is the latency when playing multiplayer. When you serve, and the opponent returns the ball, there's just enough lag to throw me off every time.Lastly, the AI is actually well done. They added a ton of personality... and I think that's super creative."

,Recommended,488310,30088189,Posted: 21 February,all,WrathOfTheHydras,"Simply put, this game is beautiful in it's simplicity.  It's a pool table in a room with a few minigames, a few levels in bot difficulty (the bot is pretty fair in terms of each difficulty, as I've never felt cheated by the AI), as well as multiplayer.  The physics of the ping pong are on point, with one minor issue that I'll get to later.  It's got a very good gameplay/quality/online/audio control interface in game.  All in all, it's not an extravagent game, but it feels polished and worth the price.The only thing I'd say as a con currently, besides the lack of cosmetic options, is the fact that whenever I try to backhand, sometimes it feels like the shot gets boosted, and flings the ball further than I meant to.  Front hand always seems like I can finess the shot down to a T, but back hands get a little iffy.  That could just be my set up though."

At 10 bucks this is a steal, if you see this on a sale, buy it without thinking about it!For this price its unbeatable, but dont expect anything else then Table Tennis"

,Recommended,488310,30285655,Posted: 2 March,all,Starboxx,"Very simple and well done Table tennis game. Unfortunately, the adversary AI does not catch balls, even on the highest difficulty. In about 10 games i played vs this AI, it only catched a ball once. It is so rare that i was not expecting it and i didn't catch it back. Other than that, velocity and physics are realistic. I'm not a good Table Tennis player, but it reminds me when i was 16 playing with my best friend.Other than that, i think there is a bug regarding the ""Waves"" mini-games. Sometimes, the ball does not hit the table and the game just seems bugged since the next waves are not continuing.I would welcome a kind of automatic response for training, where the ball always come back like if you had a good and kind player in front of you, wich is not this actual AI who doesn""t catch any ball.Overall, great game.

Ping compensation has not helped here, no matter what setting it's on. You will, most of the times, lose the point even before the ball hits your half after a return.But I will still recommend it as it IS  really an awesome game, and multiplayer in peak hours is a blast.8/10"
