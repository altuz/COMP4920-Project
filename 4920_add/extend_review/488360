76561198013020097,Not Recommended,488360,24217117,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,The Orange Rams,"Simply put: Don't buy it!Long version: You get four experiences (not counting the menu), of which one is okay: the fireworks are nice to watch. But all experiences are very clean and unnatural, e.g. ""The Mountain"" experience is simply a very low textured area where you are not allowed to wander around, but are limited to a very small area (possibly 3m x 3m). That is nothing compared to the ""Vesper Peak"" experience you get in ""The Lab"" for free! Furthermore there is a living room with a fireplace and rain outside the window which is also very sterile, but ok. The last one is a ""walk"" in ""The Forest"" which is simply an offence. There is no walk - again only a very restricted area - and the trees look very very simple. I don't know where the good reviews come from, but I feel very disapointed! I do like to sit down on ""Vesper Peak"" (The Lab) and enjoy the scenary, but I don't think I can enjoy any of these four experiences like that.Some additional words: The main reason I feel that much disapointed is that this product is not marked as early access or work in progress while it seriously is either a bad product or an unfinished product. The advertising simply does not match the state of the product. I bought a couple of games in early access to support the developer and when I bought them I knew what to expect and so it was ok and I am excited to play these games after each update. I will change my review if this product gets improved."

I've been looking for this kind of thing in VR, especially the rain room, where I can sit in an environment and chill. I would love to see more titles like this. The developer is listening to the community and will be adding more scenes. The latest update improved the graphics and performance quite a bit."

But since we have Destinations, the Lab and a lot of other free scenery apps, like the master of them all Google Earth, a tech demo like Vistacapes VR falls short.I bought it on sale for 50 cents and do not regret it since I just like having games in my collection anyways, but for non-collectors I can say, save your money and enjoy the mentionned programs which deliver so much more content and perfection.Unfortunately not recommended."

I have no idea why it says I've only been in for .7 hours...I easily have been in watching just the fireworks longer than that.The woods..I had fun crawling on the ground through the plants...I'm sure I looked like an idiot in RL..whatever.The cabin...sitting in there is easy to forget I live in the city while watching the rain on the windows.The mountain...I rather liked sitting on the edge and looking down...I have a fan blowing on me..added to the illusion..again, probably looked like an idiot...The lobby...surreal. laid down on my floor and just watched the orbs for a bit. Might try drinking and going into this place.The fireworks....I absolutely love being able to control the shells. That being said, one of the shells bogs my machine down...I'd love to see it optimized. I've got a GTX980ti, 16G RAM and I5 6700."
,Recommended,488360,24179223,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Scooter,"It's an ok experience for that price. Basically you get 4 places to explore if you don't include the starting place. As for gaming goes, there's absolutly nothing to do in these places except for launching fireworks in one of them. However, the fireworks were really well made with good sounds and visuals, and made it a joy to watch. I thought all scenes seemed a bit empty, with few details and things to look at. If it would had provided better details overall, like in one scene you can see the raindrops moving down the window, it could have been a very nice experience, but the world seems very empty and static. It still delivers good sounds and who doesn't find sitting in a cabin in the woods, while the rain is pooring outside, relaxing? You basically get what you're paying for, and for that price you really can't complain over what you get."

,Not Recommended,488360,24281276,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,Fakedawg,You know how sometimes VR titles look a lot better in VR than they do in screenshots or 2d movies? This is the opposite. It is a low quality tech demo not worth the price.

Bring more colours and types of fireworks then it could be worth a couple of quid. As it stands, not worth it I'm afraid."
,Recommended,488360,24243122,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,Whipper,"Good idea, and solidly implemented.  Textures and sound could use some love, but dev has said continued work is coming.  Worth the cheap price, especially as a relaxing way to demo VR to newcomers, but if you're looking for a well polished product I'd give it some more time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq-xPjQ_zRc"
,Recommended,488360,24253605,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,cubix,The fireworks part is really nice to watch and to play with. The indoor fireplace scene where it rains outdoor is too complex and juddery on my GTX 780Ti GPU. This scene needs some optimization. The other two landscape scenes are relatively bland and would require higher res textures and details to be really enjoyable.

Yes, my rig can handle this program.  i7-4790k, 16G DDR3, 8G MSI R9-390, SSD.Aside from the queasy, the sound delay from the fireworks was pretty cool!  Still giving it a recommend.  :)"

I thought the other simulations in this set looked decent too. Sadly, I was very disappointed for a number of reasons and definitely wouldn't recommend this.- For a rain simulation, there was no rain audio whatsoever, and this is the best bit!- The devs included a genuinely spooky horror message in what's meant to be a relaxation app, which is obviously the last thing you want in a relaxation app. I didn't hang around to find out if activating it triggered the worse events it implied. I think they were trying to be clever, but it's the wrong genre and target audience, folks.- General graphics quality is pretty bad; the rainy room was the best and it wasn't great.- General level of detail is pretty bad.- General audio quality is pretty bad.- Transition between rooms is very poor. You have to walk through a wall of solid 'water' into an unfinished area, and the app then puts you back briefly in the generic menu screen each time.- The instructions menu is full of typos that could have been avoided with a basic spell check - not a great start.Let me put it this way: The only reason I didn't get a refund here was so that I could leave a review to warn others."

76561198041709599,Not Recommended,488360,31835333,Posted: 18 May,all,FireStorm020,"To be honest, when I looked at the negative reviews prior to buying this title, I thought that they were simple expecting too much from a not-even $3 program, and were disappointed when they didn't get a lot, but quite frankly, this is really not that great. The developers seem to be under the illusion that the shortcuts that work on a regular monitor - such as using low-poly meshes with a texture slapped on them, or making bushes out of multiple flat textures - will still be ok in VR when they simply won't.The mountain and forest areas are jokes. These are where those problems stand out the most. It's very easy to see the flat planes of the bushes and trees, and the fact that very little time was put into the ground or anything more than the immediately visible environment. Seriously, if you teleport to the ledge in the mountain scene, the view below you is pretty much a green, vaguely-mountain-shaped blob. Admittedly, though, the fireworks area is sorta fun to play around in, but the fireworks are entirely manual, so if you stop pressing buttons, they stop coming.I do like the rainy area, though. They seemed to actually pay attention to this area(mostly). The objects have a high enough poly count to not look boxy, and there are actually quite a few objects around the room, all with good detail to them, and it makes it feel like a believable space. Two complaints I have about it though, are the fact that the rain sound is the same volume regardless of your distance from the window, while the fire volume is determined by proximity, making it hard to hear the fire at all unless you're right next to it, and the fact that the rain itself falls very slowly. I don't expect much out of rain, but if I can track three different drops simultaneously as they fall to the ground, it's falling too slow.Overall, if you are very specfically looking for a VR experience where you can sit and listen to rain and a crackling fire in a semi-believable environment, then go ahead and grab this app. If you are looking for something to interact with or move around a lot in, go find something else. If you are looking for a place to sit and look around at nice views, go find something else. If you are looking for pretty much anything other than the rain-and-fire thing, go find something else."
