76561197972188950,Not Recommended,488440,29840260,Posted: 10 February,all,Geometer,"Cool concept, but it's implemented in a boring, grindy and repetitive way. And the way spawns are set-up, you will never meet another player after first play-through and the ""town"" your home is in will be mostly empty lots and ugly, noobish dirt buildings."

Not only is this game an open-world rpg-mmo, but being able to build, explore, battle, and discover makes this game amazing! I would recommend this game to a lot of people! Also, the only problem is the big lag. But hey, it's early access, so what do you expect?"

Save your time and space on your computer and get another game."

76561198076380975,Recommended,488440,29612009,Posted: 31 January,all,who am I,this game is not like any game.The Developers live stream every two days and you can tell them any question or idea and they will read your comment and answer you and the game is very simple and very easy to understand .
76561198006408172,Recommended,488440,29590252,Posted: 30 January,all,Tessie Startail,I like this game much. it makes fun to play and its always even more fun to play when the creator makes the Live stream. I also like that you can talk to the Creator about the game when he streams live and tell your ideas and getting a answer.

,Recommended,488440,29697301,Posted: 4 February,all,Ginger,"In my opinion this game requires more attention than it has currently, playing it with a friend makes the gameplay a lot better and interesting, overall the character and mob models are ultra cute what I think is the biggest adventage of Angeldust, I recomend everybody to at least try this game out and give it a chance"
76561198273150999,Not Recommended,488440,29629826,Posted: 1 February,all,Dprogamer08,"Game lacks A lot of depth. Kinda gets repetitive after a while. It is more of a building game. You would go out to kill monsters for a while to get coins, then you would just build and upgrade lands. Quick tip: Never play warrior or scout, just mage and builder. And never buy weapons. They are Useless."
,Recommended,488440,29534876,Posted: 27 January,all,RedFalconGaming1111,"Looking for a game that is medevil, minecraftISH, and has a multiplayer adventure style? Well, this is the game for you! I was looking around the steam store for free games (BC i poor :P) and came across this... Angeldust! I tried it out and it is extrodinarily fun! i reccomend it to people who are ready for adventure! (And Spam Clicking Of Your Sword :P)"
76561198071414927,Recommended,488440,29533570,Posted: 27 January,all,Wildhero,"Amazingly fun game, and even with the current (as of writing this review) lack of combat features, the world is amazingly designed, and the 2-D graphics mixed with a 3-D world is extremely appealing to the eye. Combine that with the extremely frequent updates that are expanding this game even more, and soon this game (if not already) will be an extremely fun experience.One last thing: the building in this game is superb. Very good graphics, easy to master building, extremely good layouts. Extremely fun to use.TL;DR - Very fun, frequently updated, tons of potential for combat features and other RPG elements, and looks amazing. Would highly recommend."
76561198100242817,Recommended,488440,29528062,Posted: 27 January,all,Alzeron,"Angel dust is a voxel game mixed with an RPG element. It has a good community, and is playable on multiple platforms. It's also friendly and stress-relieving. An early access game with an active developer. If you're into exploring and building, and or just plain bored I recommend you try this game."
76561198216030951,Recommended,488440,29423011,Posted: 22 January,all,BrokenGlass,"I actually liked it. you get claim your own land and make houses and buildings. I claimed 3 lands near a mountain in the north and making a big fort and it is really fun.But it is a little bit boring when your the only one playing, I wish there were some NPCs in Angeldust, and mythical creatures would be cool too."
