,Recommended,488550,28499457,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,Epidurality,"Very good game, and the developer is constantly working on it (unlike, it seems, many other early-access games). It's great for anyone who's been into those bridge building games, or physics based games, or even just racing/off road car games.Pros:- Virtually bug free, which is fantastic for early-access.- Excellent physics modelling; everything behaves how you should expect it to, and behaves accurately.- Best integration with the Steam Workshop that I've seen in-game. Already a lot of user-made creations.- Custom maps available, though the standard map has a lot of different terrain to get you going.- Level of ""OCD"" is up to you; you can build a car pretty quick (or customize a default or steam Workshop car) and get racing, or spend hours tweaking every little aspect and getting things just right to shave a second or two off your laps.- Very familiar GUI/controls to anybody who has used a CAD program before. 3-window modelling space is a great idea and works very well to let you see what you're doing.Cons:- Graphics could be better. Based on my framerates, this game could increase its textures and add some better shaders without being a hinderance to even mid-level PCs.- GUI needs an update; the menus and buttons look a bit like an old Windows 95 strategy game or something.- No controller support (YET. This is on the Dev's ToDo list, so check the details and discussions to see if it's been implemented when you read this if controller support is a must-have). Having said that, due to the nature of the off-road racing, the keyboard isn't nearly as annoying to use as a road racing game for the time being."

I love to experiment with different types of suspensions and try to make my cars perform as well as possible, and I like to try to invent my own suspensions and ways of making a vehicle move. I bought the game when it was on sale (25% off) but I would pay the full $15 for it if I had known exactly how great this game was. It is now my favorite computer game by far!"
76561198152834376,Recommended,488550,28861929,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,westonian66,"This a great game, although I know some things that could only make it greater. Now, if you were going for a simple, realistic car building/ testing game, then you've done well.But here is a list of 5 things that would only make the game better.1) WaterMake the abilty for there to be randomly generated water on the default maps. This could be seen as oceans, lakes, streames, ponds, or even rivers(be even cooler if the water flowed, and moved your car). You would also want there to be the point where if you get water into your intake (more on that in a second) then your car would die. Lastly, you would want to make optional, for the people whose computers may have trouble running too much.2) IntakeAnother idea is intakes. They are quite simple. They bring in the air for the engine. One thing you could also do, is make it  so that, depending where they are placed, they can get better air flow.3) ExaustYou could tune it, make it louder, or just cut it off. This would really just be for fun.4) Defomable GroundYou could add some sort of vairable texture, or something, where as the ground could move out from under you. You could also add mud with the water update (if you made that a thing). It would be cool to have something where you were driving through mud, then you spun out, and gou stuck. you could also add diffrent ground textures to go with this. You could work on the sand, add gravel , mud, and other stuff too, like tall grass.5) WinchThe last thing that I would like to include is a winch. I wouldn't care about this one as much the other things, but some other people might.That just about wraps it up. Although lastly I would like to add that you could also add trees, and bushes, and other stuff."

Using my design skills and knowledge of cars helped me to create my first 3 designs in a few hours....and if you have ADHD like me, you will probably find yourself attaching jets to the sides of your design 5 minutes after building it.10/10 would make cars fly again."
,Recommended,488550,29305611,Posted: 16 January,all,Soda | 0w0,"This is a Sandbox car building game where you literally control every aspect of the car. That being said it is not easy, and if you're not up for a challenge of building a car, there is an option to download other players' cars off of Steam's Workshop. Personally I enjoy spending hour at a time making a car perfect at what it does, and if you enjoy a physics puzzle in a car like me, this is definitely what you've been waiting for, I know it's what I've always wanted, thank you RoKo0.-Update: A bunch of things have been added, but probably the biggest are; Angle Lock, Jet Engines, and Aerodynamics. With these new updates you can build planes, jet dragsters, and much more sturdy vehicles. One of the most entertaining things about the Aerodynamics is the ability to build incredibly fast racecars. Before you had no downforce, no matter what, but now you can add downforce, to help corners, air resistance, for an air brake, and so much more. The puzzle I speak of has been given more pieces, and am loving every update for the game. Once again, thank you Roko0."

The physics engine has a very realistic feel and it is smooth as well.If you're like me and you like cars, engines and mechanical engineering concepts, you'll probably enjoy this game as much as I have been. I tend to spend hours on one vehicle, tweaking suspension, frame size/weight/length/width, tires until it is just right. This game makes that kind of gameplay available.Where this game really shines for me is the suspension. I can't believe how amazing it looks and feels while going over bumps and taking sharp turns. The possibilities of suspensions you can make seem endless, and you're not even limited to just the shocks that are a provided part. You can even use frame parts with elasticity tweaks and come up with your own suspension designs, as you may see when checking out the workshop (which has many, awesome designs).I personally don't like shallow and arcade-style physics games that invovles vehicles. This one is the opposite.Now for some reality: It is early access. The game does feel a little empty after a while.A big one for many - it is not multiplayer. Not a big deal for me really but I know some may not prefer that.But, jets were just added! So one good thing about this game is that it is not done with additional content. So with that in mind, this is a good time waster. I'd say it's well worth the time I've put into it.Overall I give this game a thumbs up! For the price, it's definitely a good deal and plenty of enjoyment."

If you know what you're doing, you can make a good vehicle. Not many glitches, but also not many features. Still, the game is new, so features such as live multiplayer should come in the future. At the time that I got the game (February 2017), there were no bad reviews. The two bad reveiws as of April 27, 2017 are stupid. One of them states how they basically could not make a car (because they are unwilling to learn), which there is evidence that you can make cars in this game. And the other is that it does not have live multiplayer, which I understand, but you should not rate a game negatively because it doesn't have a feature that it was not expected to have. For what it is supposed to be, the game is perfect. Good job, RoKo0."

76561198149316566,Recommended,488550,25736226,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Ballzack,"I’ve played many hours of Sandbox early access building games running on the unity physics engine so naturally I was attracted to the game when I came across it on Youtube. I must admit I bought the game on impulse without knowing too much about it but I thought the price was very reasonable so I took a chance although I’ve been disappointed many times in the past.I can now confidently say that the game has exceeded my expectations and is more than worth the price tag. If you are expecting another Besiege, Scrap Mechanic or Robocraft you are in the wrong place. The game will not hold your hand, this is not a Lego style “stick a bunch of blocks together and attach wheels” type of game. At first you will be frustrated after spending 3 hours building a car only to see it collapse under its own weight. You will go back to the drawing board, re-design the frame, re-tweak, test and repeat until finally you have a solid frame with awesome suspension and steering and you get that sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.As far as Sandbox games go, this is proper Sandbox as you are not limited by blocks and you don’t have to stick to square angles. With only a handful of building parts you can make complex vehicles in any shape or size.What other content is in the game? The integration into the Steam workshop gives you endless things to play with as new maps are uploaded. Make your own racing tracks or just fool around with other people’s creations. There is Single player and multiplayer that I haven’t even tried yet (Not sure if Multiplayer is out yet). In a nutshell you won’t get bored as there is plenty to.I was very impressed when I had questions or needed help in the Steam Community Discussions that the developer actually takes time to respond to you and assist where he can. The community also seems very helpful over all. The game is off to a great start for an early access and I haven’t found any major bugs. I am very excited to see where the developer can take this."

,Recommended,488550,33779177,Posted: 24 July,all,Gr8pboy,"Dream Car Racing 3D is a very interesting game. I enjoy it for what it is, but it certainly has its own audience. The building aspect of the game is very easy to learn, but building the right thing is tough. There are tutorials but they are somewhat scant, your best bet is to look at some high-rated community made vehicles and study them. See how they made their suspension and steering work. This will you climb the learning curve alot faster, and once you mount the summit, the game is much more satisfying.All in all, I personly love the game, it is wide open in terms of what you can do. From rock-crawling trucks to supercars and tanks, there really is no limit here. If you like building, and have a persistant mind, this is where you should go."

It is early on and plans exist to expand it and include a lot more, but I am already having a blast making everything from as realistic a vehicle as it gets to utter wacko creations (walker isn't supported yet, but I've made a few, a 'grasshopper' as well and too many wheels for my sanity one too).Great fun if you like constructing vehicle and try out ideas and find solutions to 'why does this happen' and then realise the solution - if you experiment like me, any way.  Can also go the route I have not - make cars to race with.  I prefer exploring concepts myself.I hope to one day see the return of an actual, functional power transmission from engine to wheel (and eventually track etc), I do miss that and am no fan of magic power transfer without connection - but that is my only 'gripe' with the game, and I still sink too many hours into it still.  ^_^"

First off, This may be Early Access game, But what's neat is the developer is very active and open to feedback, so it gets updates and isn't dead. I do say it offers great realstic soft body movement of joints and frame, though the steering is still arcade-like as of now.My Main focus with my time spent thus far has been very entertaining, the camera system may take some time getting used to but works well.

(overheating?)- Engines can get damage and can explode/get destroyed.- Joints snapping if getting too damaged.- Point settings can make joints rotate with engine power and make frames/joints have max rotation limit on all three axis (positive and negative values)- Panels affect earodynamics and stability earodynamics-wise by default.

Using the 3 different views you can easily and precisely place a point wherever you want. A grid allows you to create well aligned stuff. It may look scary at first, but it's far, far, FAR simpler to use than a 3D modeling program. Within a few hours you will have understood all the basics required to make a complete car, chassis and bodywork, without having to read any kind of tutorial.- The games seems to be very optimized. You can add hundreds or parts to a car without ever noticing a framerate drop. It seems for example to be a lot optimized than other games such as Scrap Mechanic. As of today I have been able to create whatever I wanted to create without even thinking about performance.- The physics are realistic. Each part can strech, compress, vibrate, etc.- The (only) developper of the game seems to be very active and seems to care about the feedbacks of player, which is a very encouraging point.- The price. I paid this game about 11€. I think it's a fair price for this game in its current state.CONS :- The game has currently  very little content. You can do races along a track vs little ghost cars. You can drive around, trying to reach a checkpoint after another. You can roam freely to test your creation. And it seems like you can also play online multiplayer, without collisions between players, but I've no tested that yet. This is not surprising considering that this game is only a few monthes old. You wouldn't expect such a recent game to have a lot of content, especially since there is only one developper working on it.- There is not a lot of information about how to use the game. There is an in-game help which provides informations about the parts and their physical properties. However I think it would have been nice to have a little wiki and a few more tutorial videos for beginners. For instance, I took me a while to search information about what the ""angle lock"" part was used for. All the tutorial videos I could find were created before the update that introduced this part, so I couldn't find more information about it.- The developper working on this seems to be almost alone. While he seems to be very active, I'm not sure whether we can expect frequent updates or not, and how much content will come with each update.- The graphics are really outdated. I know that it's not what people would come for when buying this game, but since it's about being realistic, graphics matter too. Currently there are no asphalt marks, the wheels sometimes seem to sink a bit into the ground because the hitbox of the wheels get deformed based on tire pressure while the 3D model remains solid, there are no beautiful shadows or god rays, and since the maps can be procedurally and randomly generated, there are not many details. I think some official race tracks where players could compete would have been great.CONLUSION :I think it's a game worthy of its price which provides you with a freedom that you will never find in any other game that currently exist. There are concurrents like Scrap Mechanic or even Garry's mod, but none of them have the good performances and the freedom of building provided by Dream Car Racing 3D.Just like with any other early access game, the game has very little content, but it already allows you to create fully functionnal creations without any performance issue and that can be shared on the workshop, which is a very good start. The developpers seems to be planning to add more parts like wings, which suggest that we will be able to create other things than wheeled vehicles in the future.So in the end, if you like creating and inventing stuff, showing other people what you're capable of and enjoy realistic physics, if you have time and patience, if you care about creating quality stuff, then go for this game. You will probably like it, and even if you don't, well that's not even the price of a meal at McDonalds..."

Building cars in real life is one of my favorite past-times, so having some place where it doesn't cost me money to try out ideas is a great thing!If you have no creative imagination, this may not be the game for you, but if you love to tinker, then buy it right away!  I have only successfully built one solid vehicle so far, but getting into designing something to find out if it works is a lot of fun.Put the frame together, attach some wheels, an engine, shocks, and steering rod, and watch as it crumbles to pieces because you didn't brace it properly. Laugh about it, go back to the garage and figure out where you went wrong. If you build something worthy, set up a race, and challenge others to drive your custom car through waypoints to see if they can drive it better than you can!Overall, the game is still actively changing, but the developer is one that truly cares about the game, going so far as to talk to me personally, and ask me what I think.

Reminds me of BeamNG, but with a much appreciated DIY editor built in.Wether you want to make a basic road car, a monster truck or a formula one inspired geoetries, you will find all the elements you need to put your ideas into a driveable car!Racing then becomes so much more gratifying when you're the author of your vehicule; The single player mode has an awesome progression feature that lets you upgrade the different elements as you win longer and harder races, while the sandbox mode and online challenges adds a nice competitive side to it.The game itself is already in a very advanced state for being early access; it runs perfectly fine here with very little exception, yet the author keeps on adding features regardless, remaining open to suggestions from the users, which is very involving.If you like the idea of playing in a community with an accent on creativity and sharing ideas, I highly recommend you this game.Hoping to see you around on the scoreboard and the workshop ;)"

Also reintroducing any kind of a visible drive line would be nice, even if its just chain or belt. Can you also change the Angle lock to 'Welding' or something. When I weld a box frame for a car or roll cage that usually does the trick, I don't have to angle lock anything. How could two pieces of metal tubing attach to each other without welding...nevermind..."
