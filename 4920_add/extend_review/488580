,Not Recommended,488580,31797312,Posted: 16 May,all,ThePenguin,"I got this game with a coupon for €0.5.TL/DR: Don't buy it. It should be free.Hover 2030 is a semi-polished alpha demo disguised as a game. You have only one world with 20 levels (most are just very basic first world levels you would find in any platforming/collect-a-thon game.) Bad level design, no alternative backgrounds on levels or skins on anything.I finished the game in 45 min, Hover 2030 should've been free. You could probably find simular games like this on the internet called ""My first try at a video game"" and that'll atleast be free.If Hover 2030 ever gets a sequel and fixes nearly everything with this one (Like actually making a game and not a demo), I would pick it up. I enjoyed the art-style and the gameplay was fun.Bottom line, Don't buy Hover 2030."

The sprite is nice but the levels all basically look the same. While not much to look at, Hover 2030 is actually quite fun and very challenging. If you weren't given unlimited lives in this game it would be difficult beyond belief.The basic goal of each level is to collect all the coins to open up the exit. You must use your hoverboard to perform high jumps and float your way toward out-of-reach coins. Along the way you'll encounter a host of irritating enemies especially time sensitive electric gates. Controlling the hoverboard takes a bit of time to get used to and once you have it mastered the levels get progressively harder. The game tops it all off with an end boss which must be defeated in a very clever way.All in All Hover 2030 is a very nice Indie and 2D Game!10/10 From MeSweep"

Though I wish I could remap what key controls what move, you do get used to it after a bit. I imagine that the developer could do a small patch in the next few weeks to solve this.Other than what I mentioned above, I find the game well put together. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously.Here is my first impressions video.... check it out and make up your own mind:https://youtu.be/AXP6Da8VEkwHappy gaming!"

,Recommended,488580,24554092,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,thewordvirus,"I've been following Russpuppy for a while. Spooky Cats was good for a laugh and offered up and affordable (if a little bare bones) platformer and The Deletion was a very fun and challenging minimalist platformer in the tradition of geometric games like Thomas Was Alone.Hover 2030 admittedly has a strange aesthetic--a pixel character straight out of the Atari age and yet smooth, clean environments.

You can't go wrong with the price. I look forward to more games from this developer.P.S. I think my favorite thing about Hover 2030 is that every time you die you leave behind a pile of bones which remains when you respawn...meaning in some difficult levels you'll see your own skeleton scattered everywhere."

I can't pass the third level. I can't understand how this works, one time the character jump to backwards but sometimes no, and i don't know how i jump very high sometimes. This game is garbage certainly."

I like that there is no limit on respawns, you just keep playing a level until you solve it then move onto the next.Pacing in the first few levels is nice, as it introduces how the move, then move on the board, and the environment and enemies change to make a more and more fun and challenging game."

76561198089424812,Recommended,488580,32228635,Posted: 6 June,all,LordViscerus,"I picked up this game due to my recieving a coupon which made this already cheap package nearly free. I had some issues with this game, and despite it's infuriating second to last level, overall I would weigh up this as a positive experience more than a negative one. This game's premise is you are a clone boy with a hoverboard, and with help from you seemingly kindly Grandpa, you must stop a mysterious robot invasion. This platforming title has one primary objective each level; collect all the coins, then get to the portal exit. This is executed fairly well throughout the game, but there are some occasions of downright frustration.GameplayThe relatively simple yet solid gameplay here is only slightly undermined by the at first irritating controls, which become much more managable as you progress, or at least they did for me. Using 'A', and 'D' or the Arrow Keys to move, 'W' or the up arrow to jump, and holding the SPACE Bar to hover is slightly challenging at first, especially if like me you are used to SPACE being Jump more often. In early gameplay this will probably get you killed a bit, but this event will decrease and hopefully decease as you keep playing. What is irritating however is when your Jump + Hover, which is by far the highest propulsion possible without a Grav Lift, is too short to reach a platform or area, by miniscule amounts.By far the most frustrating and beneficial factors come with Deaths however. Upon being killed, you are instantly back to the beginning of the level. No checkpoints, no in level saves, ever. As hard as this sounds, which it can be, especially in fucking Level 19, you respawn with absolutely no penalty whatsoever. No coins lost. However it could be seen as a penalty that enemies respawn, which they do. Now to be fair, without this the game may be too easy, however it is annoying.EnemiesSpeaking of enemies, there are sentient ones including standard Robots, which fly and damage you if you touch them, Robots with inbuilt firearms,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!!!, invincible robots on a track, and a boss at the end of the game. Also against you are non sentient enemies, like Electricity barriers, and.. well I actually can't think of any others. I have no problem with any standard enemies, EXCEPT the Robot with a gun. NERF THAT TWAT!! Not only does it aim at you with a 360 degree rotating gun, but it can have pixel perfect accuracy, and worst of all wait for the perfect moment to shoot. Trust me, it may sound like fun difficulty, but you will rage at these. Aside from that the Boss is the only other one I want to discuss, however SPOILER WARNING. Reading my section on the Boss will ruin the twist in the game which while predictable, is still one of the cooler parts of the game. As such, I shall do the Final Words first, then do a spoiler warning and talk about the boss.Final Thoughts and VerdictsWORTH THE PRICE: YESFINAL VERDICT: 6/10 - Good Game, worth picking up as it is worth the price, however could be improved in areas.>>SPOILER ALERT<<The Boss FightSo if you are here now then you have either seen the Boss in game or just don't care about the spoiler. Fair enough. The boss is actually the Grandpa, who, in a twist that I myself prefectly predicted, turns out to be evil, and the one who presumably built the robots in the first place. The boss is fun and well made for the level, however to the Devs of the game, PLEASE MAKE IT SO HE CAN'T SPAWN KILL YOU. Several times when he killed me he teleported to my spawn. Most of the time this is fine as he is atop blocks and you can simply dodge him and get out. However in one incident, this was NOT THE CASE. His main attack, swinging his arms with electricity as hands, was timed just PERFECTLY, and he was in the PERFECT POSITION, so that EVERY TIME I spawned, he instantly killed me. This happened 3 TIMES. Please fix this. Aside from that he is fun, and works well with the level as you have to run along him to get the coins you need before he dies, dropping the last few so you can exit, and win the game. Thanks for reading if you got this far, hope this helped."
