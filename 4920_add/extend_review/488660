Not disappointed at all.Here's my honest review about the game and whatnot:Pros:Amazing SoundtrackAmazing voice acting for all cahrecters (well.... almost all)Funny times with all the characters, its very easy to get attached to themAmazing visuals, seriously this VN is eyecandyEverybody has a potty mouth and I LOVE IT.Jennifer.Cons:Cornelia is british, yet she sounds distinctly austrailian, maybe its me......Final boss is really one sided if you don't bring enough items and funding (IF it spams it's ultimate, your dead.)Everyone gets sick like 24/7, even the people who got sick the day before get sick again."

A tad juvenile for my tastes.+/- No autosave. Manually save often or you'll regret it!- The combat mechanics are easy to pick up, but extremely repetitive and often tedious.- The story was lacking. It has a great premise, but didn't feel fleshed out. At the end I was left feeling like ""Is that it?""- There are 5 romanceable characters, but it didn't feel like there was enough time to interact with them and also prepare for the final battle at the end of the month.A similar but better experience in my opinion isSunrider: Mask of Arcadius.The Long Version:You have thirty days to prepare for an all out assault on the alien base. During each of those days you will have to chose how to spend your time, either by getting to know your squad better, or training for combat, or in fighting the aliens to earn money.You need money to romance the ladies, but you also need money to upgrade your weapons and armor and use special abilities in combat. You only get money by fighting the aliens, and the difficulty ramps up fairly quickly even if you upgrade your weapons and armor. This is where things broke down for me.Stronger weapons are very expensive, plus I wanted to spend my money to get to know the women in my squad, which meant that when I was in combat it was a miserable experience. Enemy lifebars ticked down slowly, and every time they healed themselves it made me want to rip my hair out.I'd love to play this game again to get to know my squadmates better, because I think I missed out on a lot by spending my time training for the coming attack. The problem is, I don't think I can subject myself to the tedius combat for a second time. If I do come back to Just Deserts it will be a long time from now when I've forgotten just how painful it is."

Game time (not RL) is only 28 days, not enough time to build your cahracter up for final boss, especially if you are trying to build relationship. You have to give up one or the other because the ratio of of income from patrols to the cost of products to stay alive and equipment, AND the cost of  things you buy for the girls, is way off. It's impossible to defeat boss unless you: A. download the hack, B. do a whole lot of saving and restarting to get best paying patrols using the least healing products, C. give up trying to build on romance through the buying quests. Concentrate on only 1 or 2 girls and only do the non-gift quests. I won by doing B and C.TIP: I also learned of a bug that allows you to do as much after midnight as you can, if you have the energy, and keep the rewards: patrols, swimming, shooting practice, workouts. You can only purchase a couple of meals to replenish your energy, though.2. Terrible dialogue. This is where the moronic designers tried to fool the player into thinking this was a long game. There were a couple of instances that lasted over an hour because of all of the ""ers"", blank stares, and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and redunant thought dialogues that I've ever seen. Not to mention, you have to click after every sentence, instead of paragraph. Plus, one of the actresses speaks kind of slow, possibly due to poor reading skills, as she was not acting.3. A lot of wasted clicking that got very annoying. Ex: End of patrol you get: ""Player won"" click, ""Reward - "" click, ""- Energy Used"" click. ANYONE with 1/100th of a brain would have merged all three of those into one screen. Fighting sequences have a lot of unnecessary clicking as well and I already mentioned the problems in the dialogue.4. There is a flaw in one of the algarithm whre the knife, which has the highest accuracy rate, misses more than the weapons with the lowest accuracy rates. Almost twice as much. I have played the game several times with the same results.5. This is also suppost to be an action game, but it is missing the most crucial part, the ability to view your stats, and the ability to purchase boosters for things like accuracy and agility.This game is frustrating and annoying, but a pretty good game. Good luck."

Their design and personality I'd give a 10/10. There's a very human feel to some of it and experiences that some would know from the stereotypes.Here you have to grind up though. The voice acting has great talent, the combat system is a little slow, yet the story is interesting. If I were to give it a rating 9.7/10 for voice and script. Reason being the few errors of grammar and not sync'd dialogue.The combat process I'd give it a simplified 4/5. Reason being it's simple but there could be more you know? The reason being is there's no fast forward sequence, there's no skip battle animations or speed up that process so you're force to wait for their turn. The game does not need a change of difficulty but the fact the enemy kinda overcrowds you at times can be an issue and running away isn't easy chance. Also another part is in the game we have a limited amount of time that makes this game short, there isn't a new game+ to carry over or benefit bonus to relationships...The music has been an easy going so out of that so-so. I won't give a rating but it helps.Although screencapping currently takes longer for some odd reason, to the point of freezing, the game has a nice way of work. There is multiple routes, endings, and a harem end. If you are to give this game a chance, trust me, you'll enjoy it as an anime fan, vn novelist, or even if you're just looking for something to bide the time. The game itself has it's own ""references in game to other games and popular media"" which I find hilarious. However I must say that if you play this game please remember that it's gonna take some time for you to get the stuff you want. It's a pain but yeah. The great thing about the story though besides how it is, is the fact you progress through the game based off the romance. So you can literally grind for a bit but there are some unavoidable ""days"".I found myself satisfied with this game. It reminders me so much of other VNs I've played but also incorporate a better feeling by having voice actors. Which honestly a lot more could use.Oh and if you read all the way to here, there is a time limit of 29 days in the game. So try to get as much as you can in as a hint."

So you literally save and reload a patrol until you get one specific item, that has a (ridiculous) high value, just to get some equipment and to do some activities / buy Items for your heroines.This is a very annoying aspect (for me) and if I may give you an advice Vifth Floor; lower the prizes of the equipment or higer the rewards of patrols; Or make a New Game+, wich allows you to keep your equip for example.It's still a good game and if I would rate this game I would give it a 7.5/10, but as the devs still try to improve it and use aspects from the community, I wold say its more like a 8.5 or a 9/10 when its fully finished"

Big fan of Grisaia, Nekopara, Devil on the G-String, Fate/Stay Night and Hollow Ataraxia, and numerous others.TL;DR: A title that had great potential that was horrifically snuffed out like a baby seal by the big, bad polar bear of debilitating, painful gameplay/combat mechanics.If you like visual novels similar to the above ones, do yourself a favor and keep looking.Pros: Cute characters with personalities that make you want to get to know them better.Cons, (and this is really the deal breaker): The combat system is AGONIZING.  IMO, makes the game unplayable.  Utawaremuno is an example of what this game should have been.  Keep the combat challenging, yet simple, and never let impede the narrative.  The gameplay in this title makes it feel like the only redeeming quality it has is gated off by clunky, imbalanced, painful combat mechanics.:-(Was honestly looking forward to this, and I snapped it up on the first sale I could.

Here, you are a lieutenant, surrounded by 5 heroines with distinctive appearances and personalities. In which you can raise their affection towards you by exercising with them, giving them gifts, or completing a quest.You can battle aliens to get money. The battle uses turn-based system.  You can spend the money for more advanced weapons, items, or activities. Just like that in RPG games. Watch out, even though it seems like a minigame, 1 lose and you will get a game over. Thanksfully you can save the game almost at any point in the game.The heroines are voiced! It seems like the game will add more options in the future. Such as language selection. Currently the only option available is English. Japanese and Indonesian considered to be added.Combining these elements together, I find this game quite amusing.

Also trying to min-max schedule in a limited 30-days timeframe gives moderate challenge and pressure, which is always a good thing. I think a casual gamer would easily top 15+ hours of gameplay from this.One minor con factor are endings. I've checked 4 endings (harem ending not included, and they are all abrupt, short and not quite believable. One character's ending was merely a few lines of text that had next to 0 implications of characters' future. If you put high value to endings in dating genre, don't buy this game (or at least wait for 50% sale)."

It is extremely difficult to defeat the last boss without unlocking the heroines second level of assistance. I made a blunder by focusing too much on leveling up the main protagonist, only to find out later that the strength of the aliens also keep on increasing rapidly as days pass. I do hope that we can read the dialogues in a backlog style like most visual novels and have more freedom to save, since Just Deserts won't allow players to save during certain cut scenes. I hope we can also skip the game over credits (which was quite funny after reading the list of names there) when my main protagonist got killed. Last but not least, please make a longer game, far longer than 30 days!Congratulations on releasing this game. For their first release, this game is impressive.

The monetary gain is slow, but doable.  Options as far as interactions with characters is of course story and compatability driven.All in all I found the game amusing and enjoyable.

Let me quote Jennifer (a girl from the game) ""It's F*CKING good!!"". I love how quirky, unique and fun the characters in this game are. You could say the developers really brought out their love for the women (or men, I'm not judging) risking theirselves out in the battlefield. The theme song is amazing, the plot is good, the soundtrack albeit repetitive was still able to evoke emotions on important events (dates and such) and the CGs man, the CGs are the F*CKING bomb in this game, the illustrator(s) did a pretty terrific job. However, I just can't keep praising them otherwise I'd look like I'm sucking their rod for attention. It was obvious, after reading the patch notes, that there will be a ton of bugs ahead. Luckily, I only encountered a few of them. Going in detail the first bug I bumped into is what I'd like to call the repeating bug event. What this does is it repeats the events or should I say dialogue after attempting to sleep and call it a day which left me confused in my first run. The next one is  like the first but this one is during battles. I'd like to call this one the repeating animation bug (I have poor naming sense T-T). So what it does is repeat the animation of a support action, for example Cornelia's (another girl from the game) 2nd support skill after pressing the button found in the upper left corner of the screen and pressing resume the animation would repeat itself it's not enough to break the game though so I can forgive that. To summarize:Story - 7/10Soundtrack - 8/10CGs - 69/10Would I recommend this? F*CK YEAH!"

That's it ? Its just like that ?"" Story itself isn't the selling point in this game.Daily events are fun and some are cringy.Lot of MGSV, FilthyFrank and Trump references are there if you can manage to trigger that daily events.Don't know bout other references maybe someone can fill me in on this one.Voice Acting = 6/10My ears are bleeding when I heard Cecile and Cornelia's voices.Cecile doesn't sound like a french girl and Cornelia is from UK but she sounds like a drunk girl from Australia.Yumi, Eve and Jennifer are just fine.Gameplay = 7/10People said the gameplay is like Sunrider but I haven't played that game so I have no idea about it.I think this game is close to Persona series from Atlus.Its all about Money and Time Management.You have 30 days(27 days to be exact since Day 4 is story event, Day 29 is final battle and Day 30 is Decision time) in the game.Work up your stats, do patrol works to earn some money and do activities with girls.The battle is simple, really simple but sometimes it can be long and tedious.e.g You encounter 3 aliens and they have abilities to use their shield for several turns and keep healing themselves while still in shield and also they can keep debuffing your stats. It frustrated me and made me want to punch my monitor.In the end, Time and money are important.Music = 8/10The theme song is good and its catchy for me. BGMs are ok I guess.Art : 9/10Characters have a good design.My dissappointment is...they really lack the CG from dates.Basically each girl has 3 dates and they only give you 1 CG in total.I expect every date give you at least a new CG but they dont.Cheapskate.Longevity/Replayable = 7/10I played like 22 hours and almost get 100% completion.If you are clever enough, you can just manipulate save data by reloading save dataonce you get your desired achievements.THINGS THE DEV CAN IMPROVE AFTER RELEASE :- They promised us with Japanese VA, still waiting for it and I hope they can do some justice for Cecile and Cornelia's voices.- Please make ""Skip Mode"" in battle to actually skip the battle animation, its a waste of time.- Make Valerya's route, the cafeteria girl !Conclusion = 7.5/10I totally recommend this game if you are into dating sim, money and time management Persona-like game.The battles are frustrating so bear with it.Getting Harem Achievement also can be a quite challenging.And if you like Anime style Japanese visual novel, then this game could be for you."

Can you catch them all while defeating aliens from above?The soundtrack of course is in soothing to the ears as they made each scene more memoriable.The gameplay is made to be simple, with a click of button, however their are certain strategic elements to it as you learn about certain limitation while playing the game. Though it can be a bit tedious since using brute force has been me first and most used tactics, yes I suck at tactics.I personally wish, the interface was designed better since at times it can be frustrating when you need to constantly move back and forth bewteen two location, I recommend adding a previous location button, where we could easily go back to where we once were.8/10 score, would squeal again for Cecile"

Ultimately this leads to an enjoyable experience once to begin to explore more and more into their backstory and see them begin to warm up to you.The gameplay itself is standard for a dating management game. You kill aliens, get cash, and romance whatever hot grill that interests you. You can get punished hard as the game progresses if you don't manage stats and money well enough so while it is a casual game and you need to think ahead. Proper management of time and energy are necessary to advance in the game but not tough enough that it would break the game for a casual player of the sim genre.Pros:-All the grills are voice acted and it's done pretty well (mostly, not a fan on the accents)-The gameplay is straightforward and easy to understand and honestly quite addicting-The characters are all alikeable and have their own personality traits-The visuals are pretty and the characters are drawn out wellCons:-Lack of any choice for events-Stats don't give much info on what they do-Same areas and lack of any other environment-Combat can be slowIf you're into dating sims or visual novels this game is probably for you. It's not the greatest thing to be put on steam but it's a fun little sim game that you can kill a few hours with. And for something that's only 10$ it's not gonna cost you a fortune to try out."

So, I'm not disappointed. It's just very painfully average.Writing is pretty bad. Lots of inner monologuing that is supposed to be funny, but ultimately is cringy at best. Lots of ""..."" and ""Uhm..."", that are there just to artificially prolong gameplay. The story itself is very rushed. As if the author knew where he wants to start and finish, but had absolutely no idea what to put in the middle. If you take away all the grinding, unskippable animations and constant ""..."", you could probably finish the story in an hour. Some routes and characters seem like an afterthought, way less developed than the others.There are no dialogue choices. At all.There is gameplay in this game. I wish there was not. It's very simplistic and repetitive. The enemies are unimaginative cubes and spheres.The dating sim elements are dumbed down to ""buy # of items she wants you to buy, then go and farm for more money"". With time restriction of 28 in-game days this is just annoying.UI is terrible and settings are minimal. Can't speed up or skip animations (which makes already tedious combat all the more slow and frustrating), can't set the transparency of the text box, can't set the speed of text itself. No separate audio slider for voices.The art is inconsistent. Character sprites are amazing. Backgrounds are ok. CG are... 50/50. It's as if they had two different artists who drew for this game. And one of them was sloppy and didn't know anatomy at all.Music is just there. It's not memorable, nor is it distracting.Voice acting is... sigh... it's for the most part incredibly amateurish. Eve and Jen are fine. Great even. Especially Jen, her voice acting was on-point, very emotional. Great job. Cecile and Yumi are... acceptable... but Cornelia can, in my opinion, safely nominate for the worst voice actress in history of gaming. Zero emotions (and no, not because her character is unemotional) and bad sound quality. It's as if we're back in 90s.They remind me of Honey Pop. But when in HP it was so bad it was funny, here it's just so bad that it's... bad.Overall, it's not the worst visual novel that I have ever played. But then again, I have played some serious♥♥♥♥♥♥that I don't even want to remember. This game was just unsatisfying. It's cheap, and if you like visual novels, you may give it a go to kill a bit of time. Maybe you'll find it amusing. But if you LOVE visual novels, then stay away from this. It's just not worth it."

As far is a time limited visual novel where you need to raise stats to a certain level by the “end game” to not fail this would be average to above average title (B+).  I found the characters, story, art, and voice acting all very enjoyable.However, progression to success is locked behind a stat wall that could be hard to overcome.  There are battle stats, money, and relationships in the game.  To beat the game you need to hit non-specific thresholds for all of these.  Relationships open new battle skills.  Money can be used to build relationships (gift buying) or direct combat power (weapons armor).So here is the biggest negative for me.  I've save scummed more for this game than any other game I've played in the last 5 years because of  failing relationship quests and combats.Why? Relationship quests are tied to a girl, location, and sometimes an item.  To complete a quest you may need a certain girl to go to a certain zone – it she doesn’t before the quest expires you fail and lose affection.  Sometimes the quest is to kill XXX of some monster or collect a mob drop.  Once again this is random.  This means the simplest way to raise affection  is to simply feed your chosen girl(s) gifts. This is boring and suffers from a poor UI, which will have you sitting in an inventory screen and reading the same “thanks for the gift” text way longer than could ever be enjoyable.Second grievance:  Combat that you aren’t prepared for can be unbeatable, and if you die you must load your last save.  So save often. If you find yourself outclassed and need more money to buy better equipment your only choice is to buy “repellant”  and earn money at 50% rate (which means you’ll likely never catch up to monsters level as they get harder with time).  Before I got into the habit of saving before every random encounter I was about to quit the game and refund it.To help ease the money grind (I assume) there is a special (random) item drop from mobs that sells for more money than you would ever earn by farming monsters. The item I am talking about can be given to ONE girl to raise her ONE relationship level, or you can sell it for so much money you can probably max out 2-3 girls with gifts, this just forces the player to grind the through the UI pointlessly."

Although these aliens look like washed up Rubik's cubes, they sure don't let you off easy if you're not careful.

The voice acting is beautiful, despite the sort of awkward pronunciations of each girl's accent. The voice acting is solid and entertaining.Now courting each girl is exactly how I imagined it to be. You can choose to go to certain areas and chat these girls up and they change their position according the time of day. You can also buy them gifts and train with them to further increase your relationship with them. They are all equally attractive and cute so it's going to be awhile before I actually settle on one of these gals.Overall, for the price and game play, this game is worth the money.

76561198058156743,Not Recommended,488660,25062724,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,Inspector Dosh,"This is a game that has left me very conflicted on whether or not I can recommend this game at all as there are some things that are fairly good and other aspects that are not so good. I don't expect myself to write a very long review of Just Deserts since I normaly don't play Visual Novels very often and I apparently have very bad tastes for them as well. First off, the voice acting is pretty good, especially the fact that they went as far as to give them accents for their respective nationalities. What's a bit awkward is that the voice acting sometimes does not match the text on the screen along with one or two instances where the audio bugs out a bit. For whatever reason, everytime your player name is included in the character's speech, they just stay silent and never talk in a way that they can say the same thing making the conversation feel a bit awkward, but it's possible to talk in a way where they don't have to address the player name to keep the natural flow of their speech, but they never did so there's that.If you're expecting a deep story behind the alien attacks, you're not gonna get it since the story is just ""aliens are invading Earth, don't bother asking any questions and just go exterminate them"". With aliens in the picture, there is the combat system to go along with it, but unfortunately the combat in the game is a huge deal breaker for some people because the combat system is extremely basic, flawed, and just plain boring that feels like unnecessary padding, especially the fact that you cannot skip the combat animations and text that constanly pops up every time an action takes place. Getting equipment is outrageously overpriced compared to how much money you earn which is especially problematic in the early game where you only have a pistol and a knife, plus it's completely reliant on RNG in addition to the enemy always having the advantage over you. In fact, most of the equipment available for purchase is completely useless and a waste of money with the only weapons you will find yourself using the majority of the time is the RPG, the shotgun, the smg, and occasionally the knife for cutting though shields. During combat, you can call out for support from any of the heroines you've brought with you during your patrols, but the way it was built makes money even more of an issue since calling in support of any description will siphon a huge sum of cash out of your bank account for whatever reason. There also appears to have an initiative system for whomever has the higher speed stats gets to go first and the game does not give you any information on the enemy's statistics whatsoever other than a generic health bar so there's more RNG on top of your RNG. Lastly, the aliens themselves are not very interesting to look at because they're all just elemental polygons.There are quests you can partake in to increase your relationship status with the other heroines, but at least half of them is completely dependant on RNG while the other half is to empty your wallets on overpriced tat like say Cornelia asks you to kill X number of X-type aliens, but you could do nothing but patrols for 3 days straight and never reach the amount of kills needed to complete the quest all because X-type aliens never spawned or don't spawn enough to get there.At the end of the day, Just Deserts is not a bad game per say. It's a light-hearted story with light-hearted characters that apparently goes down a more serious tone when you get to know them I suppose, but then again, the tone of the writing was never consistent to begin with. There's an alien invasion, yet most of the time everything else that happens around you makes you completely forget that there is an invasion in the first place. There are multiple endings, but then you end up asking yourself if you want to deal with the monotonous combat system for several more hours just to see a different variation of the the same ending. I have no idea. Perhaps it depends on how you personaly feel about your first playthough, but if I had to describe all of the mechanics of this game in just a few words, it would be one of those games that has RNG built on top of RNG times seven. To recommend or to not recommend? That is the question I ask myself everyday when it comes down to personal enjoyment vs overall quality. If you can tolerate the questionable mechanics of Just Deserts and enjoy a light-hearted story to boot, then Just Deserts could be for you. Otherwise, I regrettably suggest you look elsewhere for something that's less frustrating to go through."

Also this game the reason I created my Steam Account.I really enjoy it, this game is Dating Sim Game with stories event in it or maybe with Visual Novel concept.So this is not like causal Visual Novel you play to relaxtation, read story, and choose. This is dating sim game, so you need to think strategy to managed it and complete it. This game has limited time to complete the route, some quests to increase the love meter, and manage your money, also your Health.This game has different 7 endings, with different story. I think the story is good (especially Eve Route), because this is Dating Sim game not a VN, so I thinks it's fine if there doesn't has strong stories.Also I enjoyed the sounds. The Voice and Soundtrack it's amazing.The 5 Heriones, and the casual costume is match with the situation with game, and also you can buy other costume on shop, to get different atmosphere. But I think only the default costume match with the situation of stories, because that is millitary.....The Game is amazing and challenging 10/10, but if you want relaxtaion VN, or maybe strong story, I think this is not your game. In this game you need strategy in limited time, to get your WAIFUS.And also I think you could find the third child in movies ""Midnight Special"". Didn't understand Try Eve Route"
,Recommended,488660,28654888,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Xaphier,"Summary:+ Good voice acting.+ Characters.+ Dialogue.+ Music+/- End game.- Story depth.- 1 playthorugh is short.- Combat system.I always was a bit reserved about games which had a combat system in it like this. Mainly because I'm really bad at them, as at it turns out I am bad at them in a certain aspect. Took me 2 hours only to get past de 3th fight. But well, that is going to be your personal taste.Onces I figured out the combat system it was pretty easy and repetitive.Allright, besides the combat system I obviously decided to give this a try. And I did not regret my decision.I had so much fun reading through the dialogue. All the characters are made pretty well, with each their own story to tell.  Of course not so in-depth as some other sims out there. But what could I expect more for 10 bucks.However, there is a small downside. The main story not very well made. The MC aside. You are batteling aliens which come from a place that is never explained, or why they are here in the first place.1 playthrough is short. Because you only have 30 days and finite amount of energy each day.Another thing, neither positive or negative. Is that, when you get to the end of the game. It get's very repetitive. With nothing else to do (if you only focused on 1 path, and you finished it), there is basically nothing else to do except for training the whole day."

Story is totally great too. Nothing NEW but it moves the game along well. Only real problem is: combat. A weakness. Good enough that you can beat the game however many times you want but it's a pain. Don't like all the clicking required, the absolute weak amount of damage you do, etc. remidns me of the 90s/early 2000's flash games.Characters:Eve is very reminiscient of Rei from Evangelion. But she ends up interesting and her final arc explains much of the backstory of the game and her final part in her route is cute. So she's overall okay. Nothing GREAT but good.Jennifer is probably the best one. Her dates are very deep and interesting and she's a very fun character. Very well done and best girl. basically: she is well written and her story in the dates are well writtneCornelia: Also very well done. I didnt' think I'd like her (I originally did Jen and Cecila) but man, I wish I did her route instead of Cecila just after a few days of talking to her on the side. She's very interesting.Cecila: A disappointment. I don't think she' sbad and she is very cute and lovable but man, she doesnt' really have a strong story or anything. Take her for a cute route but not for well written.yumi: didn't do it. Not my typeOverall, it's quite good. Combat will always be iffy. Especially as you'll be dependent on drops for making money easy and it's quite rare."
