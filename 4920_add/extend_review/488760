,Recommended,488760,23670688,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,Nefrai,"Put a little time in this, pretty cool atmosphere and idea. Needs some polishing for the combat, it's a bit hard to get the fireball off in a panic. Enemies also tend to jump in close, and you can't hit them since they get in past the wand. Might be part of the ""kill you a lot"" dynamic not sure, lol. It would be nice to be able to swipe at a close enemy to stagger them (even if you only get one stagger). Looking forward to seeing where this game goes.One thing I would advise, is changing how you grip objects. Right now you have it set to ""snap"", and you just grab the center mass of any object. You can easily change that to grab the object based on controller location, so it feels better. Picking up a chair for example is weird, since it snaps it to the center of the chair. Just a thought for a smoother experience.Also I'm not sure what was going on, but the words you have on the left hand itself are inverted and backwards. I had to turn the controller all around to read the hints on the hand, lol. Not sure if that was a mistake where the words are mirrored or intentional?Overall though, I am having fun with it, though I'm kinda resigned to dying when I enter any new room at the moment, hahah. Made me jump a couple times, runs smoothly, teleportation works well. I did get an object stuck to my hand once (a feather quill), I managed to detach it from my hand by passing it through a book. With a bit more controller debugging, this is shaping up nicely. I've only gotten far enough in to meet one new monster (it was a fast one), and learned to make fire and a summoning circle. Hoping there are some melee range spells to learn for when enemies jump right into you."
,Recommended,488760,23726385,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,EternalGamer,"Left Hand Path is a first person view action RPG a lot like Vanishing realms but darker, harder, and more horror influenced.  The game takes some nice cues from Dark Souls in terms of design.  Short cuts that open pathways back to earlier areas, a persistent world where you keep your items, shortcuts and bosses defeated even if you die, etc.One thing that sets it apart is that this is primarily a spell casting game.  You spend a lot of time drawing signs in the air and channeling the spells through your staff.  Sometimes even sitting your staff on the floor to conduct rituals.  The air drawing is unique and feels really good.This game may be early access but there is already as much here than many VR games.  If you are tired of endless wave shooters and want a ""real game"" for your Vive, this is an excellent choice at a cheap price.  The developer is very active on forums and is making continious quality of life improvements.Note that you'll probably die a lot at first.  But in time you'll get better.  Fear not the darkness. Choose the Left-hand Path."
76561197970993196,Recommended,488760,28967133,Posted: 2 January,all,Montaigne,This game is right up there with Vanishing Realms. It's the scariest game I have ever played and the graphics and sound are excellent. The developer is active on the forums and is always polite and willing to help. Really wish there were more Vive games of this quality. If you like horror/arcane magic/dungeons then this is a must buy!
,Recommended,488760,23678152,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,Naravail,"tl;dr: It's early access, very playable, and is already quite fun. Great game dev!Edit: I see these negative reviews complaining about the game and you need to realize, it is early access. The game needs polish, lots of it. It has been out for a day and the dev has already pushed an update incorporating feedback. Really, don't buy an early access game (definitely one attempting to be something more than an endless arcade game) and then post a negative review after 10 minutes complaining about the game. It's ridiculous.---- Review -----So, if you're into RPG games at all, you need to buy this. It's obviously an early access game, but it's already fantastic and while I've played about a hour and a half, I already feel like I have gotten my moneys worth and I am thoroughly looking forward to further playing the game and its' future iterations. It's the first game that I've lost myself in the Chaperone boundaries (ended up running into my couch) since I was so engrossed while attempting a ritual.There's already a decent amount of lore (little scrolls and such that leave you wondering whats occurring) and I was incredibly surprised to see some voice acting. The graphics are fine and while not amazing, are very playable. The spell mechanics themselves are great and I really enjoyed the game. Seriously, this is the first VR game I played this long continuously without switching to another game and I only stopped due to my neck being sore.For the Dev:My complaints:- The signage while good is very forgiving. I have done a straight line and had Agil appear. Very minute and not a huge bother me, but thought I would mention it.- Speaking of signage, quick question. Do you need to draw said sigils in 3D (as in curve around behind a line) or is completely flat fine?- For rituals (specifically the first one) it states to push your staff to the ground. I personally read this as the end of the staff, not the bottom of the staff so for the longest time I couldn't figure out why I wasn't completing the ritual.- Also, I did the same exact steps in the ritual (the correct steps) multiple times and the ritual wouldn't complete until well... it did. It was starting to annoying me considering the sheer amount of time I spent simply trying to draw two symbols yet continually failed to complete the ritual.- Overall confusion. I haven't played the likes of Dark Souls so I cannot compare it, but I was quite confused throughout my playthrough. While I figured everything out, I died quite a few times not knowing how to re-act to the enemies. I only accidentally figured out the firing spell and that was how I killed the enemies (no where did I find a book/scroll telling me about that specific spell while the other ones were mentioned throughout the level).Edit: Just saw on reddit that apparently the attack spell was in the Grimoire.. Woops, I was under the impression that spells only entered it upon being found.- Item pickup mechanic while working fine is kind of weird. Specifically, when picking up something such as a knife it is often lopsided and being held in a very weird way (I attempted to fight with a knife and it didn't go to well). This is kind of true for the books/scrolls, but it still works perfectly fine.- I think the spell hitbox should be expanded. Specifically, if an enemy is too close to you, they clip through the staff and the spell will go past the enemy opposed to hitting it.Additions I would like to see:- Walking teleportation. I tried out the touchpad usage and I am not a fan. Teleporting is fine, but it would be great if we had the teleport mechanic (point and click), but opposed to teleporting the character proceeded to walk to this spot. As for implementation of jumping across things, I think teleporting itself would work fine and maybe down the road incorporate a camera view as if jumping down/across/etc. This system is currently in the VRZ Game and I'm quite a fan.- A home level. The little cave where the fire is located I think could present itself as a fantastic homescreen. As of now, you start the game in that little room, walk onto a ledge, and the level begins. I myself think you should make that cave where you spawn and incorporate the same mechanics of the current spawn room into it while after level completion you return to it. For the first level, you could lack having anything in the room (outside of the menu) before completion and upon further completing levels, more is added.- A Pause button- Locking of items when grabbed opposed to constantly holding the grip button (this seemed to happen a few times, but wasn't constant and not sure if said occurrences was a bug or me doing something).- Optional voice acting for scrolls and items picked up. To avoid having to have a variety of voices, perhaps have a narration voice for all of them.- While this may already be in the game (again, only played the first level), I would love some sword fighting and the option to switch off from the staff to a sword and possibly even duel wielding and being able to cast spells (maybe support spells such as something to create a temporary teammate, etc.) To still maintain the mechanic of a single handed staff, you could have more powerful spells drawn with an empty hand and weaker spells drawn with the staff itself; or perhaps even only providing melee support spells if dual wielded (opposed to a shield or something of that manner).- Better dodging/countering for the enemies. Specifically speaking about the first level enemies kind of just walk at you and once they're at you they attack. You need to teleport away and proceed to attack them from a distance since ducking and such didn't seem to do much to avoid their attacks. I also felt like this for the boss itself at the end of the 1st level. This in comparison to the enemies in the beginning of the second level in which they are swinging at you and there feels to be a more dodge-heavy mechanic.I tried to mention everything I thought while playing, but if I forgot something I'll edit this post/or post on your reddit post."

The atmosphere is genuinely creepy. I haven't been this cautious moving through a VR game ever. Please don't ever add giant spiders. I'll never be able to finish the game hahaha.I do wish there were some sort of melee attack though. When the enemies get the jump on me, its a huge pain to fight back.*Disregard this, I got a little further in the game and theres a spell for that.I had to stop because of a very rough bug where the game slows to a crawl once the letters for the compass directions appear. I'm glad I was kneeling when it hit the first time I did the ritual. Not everyone has this issue it seems, just brace yourself for it the first time.*The developer is already aware of this bug. Get in the discussions for the game if you need help or to report bugs. He's responding super quick, which I really appreaciate!Other than that and occasional object getting stuck to my hand, this game is going places. Keep an eye on this one!"
76561198311799599,Recommended,488760,24246939,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,VRManiac,"There's much more to this early access game than I expected.  Spell casting is challenging and unique, and the RPG elements like purchasable upgrades really feel like upgrades and not just ""10% more"".I think this will be one of the hallmark titles of the early 'frontier' VR days that I'll remember fondly years from now when EA and Bethesda take over all our HMD's.  Kudos to the dev for a well-thought-out and ambitious title that really showcases what a VR experience should be."
76561198045499862,Recommended,488760,23678008,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,thepalatinepoet,"This game is still early in development, and as such I recommend this game with caveats.In Left Hand Path, the player navigates a dark, foreboding realm casting spells and discovering the world. In particular, the spellcasting system is a delight to use, and prompted me to buy it in the first place. By holding the trigger on your off hand, your in-game finger leaves a trail of wispy light, which you can use to draw out runes in the air. These runes will cast spells, varying from bolts of colorful energy to conjuring flame, and even complex rune rituals which require drawing different runes in different compass directions. I would play a game just for these mechanics, and they're done well here.On the whole, the mechanics of spellcasting are combined with a more challenge-oriented combat system, and shadowy, meancing world. A concise summary of Left Hand Path is basically three words: ""Dark Souls VR."" This is a game that does not shy away from killing the player. It is most rewarding to those who are patient, careful, and plan ahead. Many first encounters will undoubtedly prove lethal, and death will be a familiar friend to those who forge their way through the 2-3 hours of content.VR brings the punishing difficulty and survival horror tension to a whole new level. I legitimately jumped when I met my first few enemies, and jumped again when enemies I thought I had seen before turned out to be new, faster versions of themselves. In a room with four torches to light, I found myself terrified of lighting all four torches, since everyone knows lighting all four torches means something's about to happen, and in Left Hand Path, ""something"" is frequently ""monsters."" The game's teleportation mechanic has a cooldown between movements, so even though I could blink across a room at any moment, I practically felt like a character in a horror movie trying to start their car as the shambling horrors approached. I like feeling scared, and I really like how well Left Hand Path scared me.So! Should you, proud fellow Vive owner, purchase this game? Depending on who you are, my answer is ""Yes"" or ""Yes, but later."" I'll explain.Are you a Dark Souls fan? Does dying early and often please you? Do you memorize attack patterns, enemy locations, and plan out each encounter, including escape plans if things don't work quite right? Is a game too easy if it's not trying to rip your face off and ridicule your inexperience? Then Left-Hand Path is for you. Even in its early access form it's packing enough combat and enough exploration to be worth $15.00. The VR experience transforms deadly combat with enormous enemies into spine-chilling encounters with monsters your eyes are convinced are inches away. And the developer is working hard to make the game fairer, so each death feels warranted, and each kill feels earned. It's a great game now, and I expect it to be a fantastic game soon.Are you more of a Vanishing Realms fan? Do you like exploration, fantasy magic, and adventure? Does reading intricate lore and learning to cast new spells motivate your every move? If so, this game has what you're looking for, but you may need to develop some fierce VR spellcasting skills to get to them. If you're not frustrated by trial-and-error style progression, where knowing isn't half, it's pretty much all the battle, the world of Left Hand Path is a fascinating and enjoyable romp. As more content is added and death feels fairer, I think this game will go from being ""fun, but hard"" to ""fun and hard.""I can't predict the future, of course. This game will feel a little rough around the edges, particularly in the way items are picked up and the experience between play (menus, death) are handled, but the core gameplay is fun. Drawing spells in the air feels glorious. And in my opinion, the game is only going to get better."

,Recommended,488760,28236479,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,zenfulyeah,An awesome experience for VR and by far my favorite game on the Vive as of now. The room extending movement setting is an excellent feature and helps add to the immersion since it enables you to actually walk through the world by using your room scale space. Game is creepy and adrenaline inducing but not to the point of it being unplayable. Spells are fairly simple to cast using the gesture system (though I found myself fumbling around during the first few surprise encounters). Even though the game is still being developed I would highly recommend it even in its current state.

The dev is really active on Reddit and seems to be doing his best to address any and all concerns.From the little time that I did play, I throughly enjoyed the system of writing runes with one hand and having your staff execute it.

Without getting into the details and spoiling specific encounters, the game can be very creepy at times!  Definitely a reccomendation from me, and the relatively low price compared to other similar Vive games right now is a big plus.  There's a few hours of content, and the dev seems like he or she really has a plan for the story and game mechanics as more content is added.  Additionally, the dev is open to community feedback and suggestions, which shows that he or she actually cares about making this a great Vive experience.I won't get into the details of the mechanics or anything, as some research could explain most of it, but it's unique from what I've seen of other VR titles.My only complaint?

Later in the game, you upgrade your arcane light spell and much of the tension is relieved with knowing where your enemies lie. The Dev cleverly circumvents this and brings the tension roaring back in a crescendo with truly terrifying creatures visible only out of the corner of your eye.Locomotion:Several locomotion options are available to accomodate those who prefer teleportation systems, as well as those with iron stomachs who favor slide locomotion for a truly immersive experience. There is even a room extender option that translates small movements inside your play area into exaggerated character movement in-game, allowing even small play areas to be used for physical exploration.Spell System:The spell system is very well done, and while you have little health and no regeneration, careful preparation and skill allows for very rewarding combat without ever making you feel too powerful for the enemies you face. Similar to Dark Souls combat, as you progress you become more proficient at dispatching enemies, but a single slip-up still costs you dearly.Combat:Game mechanics allow for different playstyles and strategies as well. You can teleport to keep enemies at bay, cast defensive spells or even dodge and duck to avoid taking damage. The Room Extender function synergizes well with this tactic, allowing you to dodge just out of an attack's reach. Once you've mastered dodging it can be a supremely satisfying experience.The Dev is very involved with the community and open to feedback as development of this VR gem progresses.10/10"

The combat system is one of the more polished ones I have been able to expierience in VR and hope that more VR games take a note from Left-Hand path.All in all 10/10 from me.

,Recommended,488760,28350417,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,yipiyip,"I have played this game through the first two ""levels"", and have shown it to many a recently-dead friend (I swear there's no connections there...). There are some who have called this game a ""VR Dark Souls"" and while I'm inclined to disagree, there are similarities. For those who are faint of heart, this is much scarier than even some 'horror' VR games out there. It's not exactly meant to be scary, as far as I can tell. I haven't run into any jump scares or needlessly loud noises, but the fact that you can die at almost any moment, coupled with how hard it is to cast in combat while you're stressing about how easy it is to die (a vicious cycle) can combine to make some heart pounding gameplay without the need for cheap tricks.That's the atmosphere, now let's move on to the packaging: this is a VR game, and it feels like it. With options for either teleporting or 'slide-walking' this game gets it RIGHT. My brother can't do the slide, he gets sick, so the teleport is great for him. I love slide-walk, however, and don't play any other way. The fact that this is an option, and you can even use /both at once/ is amazing. As for the spells, the feeling of actually memorizing hand motions to cast spells and rituals is wonderful, and while still slightly buggy (it's early access people, what do you expect?) has great potential. I can see this kind of intricate runework getting coupled with some voice commands to do amazing things one day (perhaps on some of those 'VRMMO's coming out?). The wish-fulfilment is there, and it is great.As for the game itself, it is very good. Graphics are as you'd expect for todays VR games - a good mix of form and function. They look good enough to draw you in as believable, and are blocky/simple enough to run without problems on most machines (assuming those machines can already run VR, that is). I could ask for some slightly better meshes on the monsters, but like I said, early access. I can wait!All in all, Left-Hand Path is an amazing mystery game. Yes,  you heard me right - at the core of this game, a mystery is waiting to be solved. The plot, so far, is solid. Get in there, Quisling!"

The atmosphere is still gloomy and dark. The game slowly unravels bits and pieces of contextual details about who you are and why you're there as you explore and read various scrolls, letters, and books. The combat system favors quick usage of teleport to avoid taking damage, and the locomotion options allow for point to move sliding style as well as a unique method called ""Room Extender"".I often found myself teleporting a safe distance away enemies to start drawing symbols in the air while pointing at them with my staff. When I picked up the melee spell, I felt like combat suddenly became much easier than having to deal with drawing symbols to deal damage. The need to deal ranged damage by drawing the rune for ""Vis"" seems to still come handy, as there are times I cought enemies who were unaware of my presence. I'd send a quick flaming bolt at them to get their attention.The sense of scale is good, especially in sathriel where there is more open space to just roam around in, just to look at the landscape or landmarks that you'll use to orient yourself during exploration, combat, and gaining strength by finding new spells."

Little balance tweaks (Though the adage of ""If the enemy can do it, so can I"" holds VERY true here) and some polish over time.

I thought that it had a lot of potential, but wasn't entirely sold.Five hours of additional story content, including professional grade motion capture performances and some pretty decent voice acting, finally sold me, and my god, I'm having so much fun getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked by this thing!So first off: the gestural casting is surprisingly good.  The gestures are distinct enough so that you don't even need to watch what you're drawing to get it right.  This is actually pretty important, since there are times when you'll just be spamming spells left and right in an attempt to get out of a problem you've gotten yourself into.Second: there's just enough ambiguity in how you use said spells to force you to experiment, which makes the sense of satisfaction when you've actually been able to master the use of a new spell that much more satisfying.  The dev also seems to have done a lot to accomodate people with different setups and needs, even going so far as to include an ""arachnophobe"" mode to replace the giant spiders that appear later in the game with less phobia inducing creatures.There are some downsides.  Load times are long, there are occasional bugs (including one that jumped me forward a level) and there are definitely times that you'd like to be able to backtrack where the game just won't let you.  Sure, one could argue these add replay value, but it does feel like there's still some more polish to be done here.Fortunately, the game is also nowhere near done yet.  The Dev has stated that as more content is released the price may rise again, so if you're at all interested in a game that will make you feel like a real mage (as well as one of the longer RPG experiences on the platform right now) I highly recommend you pick this one up now!"

I am really enjoy it; I like the soft levelling system, mini puzzles and rituals with runes.  As others have said, spell variety could be increased (though it's far from bad); maybe a crowd control spell or something?  Huge fan though; the gesture recognition is bang on.

I think the idea of having to go through the world with little explanation, having to figure out things for yourself by reading ingame lore is pretty awesome, however I this game is way too damn frightening to me.The assets are not that pretty to look at and the sound is mediocre at best, but I can certainly see this game becoming a pretty good horror game (and already being a good one for a few hours).I think demoing this to friends who are into horror would be a great thing. I'd love to watch and comment and try to guide them through, but I have to say it's too much for me to handle.I've played through Amnesia and Penumbra quite ok and enjoyed them thoroughly, but Left hand path is really just a step too much for me.If you like horror games and games where you need to figure stuff out yourself then this is definitely a nice buy.However, I feel like the combat boils down to panickly casting spells and loosing a bit of the ""I am a magician with lots at my disposal"" feeling. You don't really have combat in the tradition sense but it feels a bit more like a QTE where you just need to cast a spell properly and you survive.I'd love slower enemies with more heads-up time and a longer fight where I can and should utilize different spells and techniques. I'm talking the freedom to go with different spells though, not being restricted to one specific chain.@Dev: I love what you did and I have to say I am a bit disappointed in myself that I just can't bring myself to play it :P"

I felt like a level 1 D&D character in a level 3 dungeon.  The zombies run up much too close.  I appreciate trying to get a good ""scare"" tactic thing going, but seeing as how my staff seems to impact EVERY OTHER FREAKING THING IN THE GAME INCLUDING CHAIRS BUT DOESN'T HIT A ZOMBIE and it goes through them, so I can't just push them back and I shoot the attack spell past them, I thought it was a little problematic.  It ""might"" eventually turn into a good game.  That's what I'm hoping for, and so the only reason I'm NOT requesting a refund, but the spell mechanic is really clunky to actually fight with and the staff doesn't seem to actually do a whole lot except act like a pointer.  A better tactic might be to ""cast"" the spells with the staff OR the left hand, then hold them until you pull the trigger.  I can think of several potential solutions, but as it stands now I died several times and I felt like it wasn't from being unskilled or unable to play the game, but clunky interface.

It's certainly closer than a lot of other games out there right now, but I dunno, maybe I'm too picky.My biggest complaints are1) Enemies are dumb. Like *really* dumb. They just kinda run at you and die super fast.2) The number of spells you have at your disposal is very limited, and they aren't very interesting.The game really tries to pull you in with the horror and light storytelling, but neither are really what I am looking for (and neither are very good here either...)My other nitpicks would be that the screenshots almost make it seem like there is some sort of alchemy mechanics or a lot of interactivity with objects, but there's not any of that. You can't touch/ pickup most stuff and even if you could, there's nothing to do with it. This game is literally ""walk down the hallway, spam fireballs at the braindead enemies, rinse repeat"".There are no complex systems.There is no combat depth.There is nothing interesting here.This game is boring."

Enemies (zombies) are poorly animated, make almost no sound, glide faster then their walking animation, and just run in a straight line for you.There is no indication of your health, and no indication of taking damage, the enemies just kinda slap at you.The spell casting seems like it could be fun, but its been put into a game that otherwise feels like ""students first time in unity (I'm just assuming that is the engine)"".One of the only games I have felt I need to review, just to warn others away from this game.

I really want to see the progression of this title, as this can be an amazing experience after some development. I probably wouldn't pay the same amount again, but it's not a major disappointment by any means, I just wish it were further along in its development at this point.

I loved that game. This game takes it up a notch as you draw the runes in the air with your controller. It's a mechanic that works very well so far.The graphics are crude, the sound is OK, but the story is good so far and the dev added achievments, which I enjoy. It looks to be a labor of love, and I like that a lot. The dev is listening to us, the users, and implementing changes based on our preferences. Another BIG plus. Very nice use of room scale VR too. I liked having to duck into small passages.NOT a fan of teleporting monsters. Well, super speed monsters. VERY immersion breaking. Don't try and be Dark Souls, be Left Hand Path. Define your own game. Don't break the imnmersion with cheap tactics. Immersion is the magic of the experience, and you won't achieve presence with something that breaks the immersion. There is no point and it just ruins the experience. If you want the monsters to be tougher, just raise their HP and have them move in a detrmined NATURAL way. That way I stay in the world you created, not be reminded I'm in a game everytime I'm Zerg rushed by a creature.That being said, I enjoy this game a lot.

There may be more to it, I'll have to go back in.Gameplay is fun and there is an interesting backstory developing when you read all the readables. Using hand gestures to cast spells and aiming them with your staff worked really well. The game did a good job of reading my gestures, though it would occasionally activate my lightning melee staff when I was trying to quickly shoot off a fireball.I liked the mechanic for conjuring, but the location of the compass points did not surround me properly. I wasn't sure where south was supposed to be (the S symbol wasn't 90 degrees from west).There are a couple bugs, like getting killed by a sword clipping through a closed door, but the game played pretty smoothly otherwise. The spell effects looked pretty cool, but the environment was very simple and seemed like a placeholder. The were some anomalies that were pretty distracting, like the moving trees (I think you need to turn off billboarding) and hills appearing and disappearing as you turn your head.Movement schemes: Teleporting was OK, but maybe set a limit to the teleporting distance to keep the player grounded. I kind of liked the optional movement where you press the pad and move in the direction you point your wand. I felt like a wizard sliding forward magically. It was comfortable as long as I refrained from moving the wand left or right as the sudden rotation is not pleasant feeling. I would leave the turning mechanic to just turning IRL or add a separate option to enable that aspect.Overall, the game shows good promise and is playable now, but could be much improved graphically.
