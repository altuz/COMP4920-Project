The story is cute, and silly. I was satisfied with the ending, but it definitely leaves the story open for a sequel. The dialog is full of witty banter, and has a whole lot of puns that made me smile several times during my playthrough. The game makes many references to outdated real world things and other games, which I found to be quite funny. Does anyone else remember clippy, and how cute, but annoying he was?The point and click gameplay was as expected. You click around to move, and choose what you want to interact with, and then decide how you want to try and interact with it. The puzzles are clear-cut; they don’t offer much of a challenge, and the game even acknowledges that fact. Movement felt on par with other point and click adventure games I’ve played, like Sam & Max. The character usually cooperates, but sometimes when the camera angle change it causes you to walk the wrong way.Pros:great dialog with the witty comments, jokes, and puns will make you smile or laugh quite oftenpoint and click gameplay is what you would hope for, and it's comparable to other point and click adventure games (i.e. Sam & Max, The Tales of Monkey Island)the puzzles are straightforward, and make sense, but they are also on the easy side (which may be a con for some)character animations look good, and the environments look decent as wellvoice acting was decent, and the soundtrack was finefull controller supportCons:very short, and lacks replay value, unless you plan to go back for achievements (I completed the game in just under 2.5 hours, but I expect some people will take around 3 hours)(nitpick) even with the anti-aliasing turned on, it still looked like there were some funky edges(nitpick) one small area where you try and click on the arrow to move to the next screen, but the character doesn't go, and another area where both characters are moving around, and you collide - it’s not a big deal, just a minor nuisance(nitpick) keybindings are not customizable (but the default controls are standard, and will be fine for most people)Conclusion:Overall, I enjoyed the game, especially all the witty banter, and out of game references that came along with it. It’s a good pickup for those who enjoyed Sam & Max or Tales of Monkey Island. Although, it is an extremely short game, so you may want wait for a sale.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."
,Recommended,488770,32717403,Posted: 24 June,all,Quirken,"I laughed. Out loud. Several times.Usually when I see/hear funny things, I'm only smiling in my head. This game has just the right balances of smart and dumb humor combined with jokes making fun of point-and-click games. The main character reminds me of somebody (personality wise) from Family Guy (probably due to the art style combined with his style of posturing), except consistently quality bar and better humor. And no filler.Gameplay-wise, it's a pretty standard point-and-click. No huge suprises, and while I haven't beaten it yet, I don't really expect any. (All the reviews I skimmed suggest that I'm already probably halfway.)It took me about an hour to decide I wanted to show and/or get gift copies for 3 friends."

The game feels fresh with it's jokes, setting and visuals. The whole thing screams quality, like a posh ponce quaffing tea in his country estate. The only gripe I had with it is that it is, as you might have already gathered, is that it is short. Honestly, that isn't that big of an issue if more of us buy the game the more of a chance there is we get a sequel. I deserve that. You deserve that. Your dog deserves that. Your chinese surveillance gadget hidden away in your home deserves that. The Queen deserves that.Treat yourself, it's almost christmas."

The puzzles are a little on the easy side, but a lot of the tongue in cheek nature of them lead me to think it was more because it was the tutorial to the game. So i was, i admit, somewhat surprised when I saved to discover I was a third of the way through the game and not the barely scratching the surface like I thought.The game is beutifully rendered, the ship has lots of little details in it. but the problem lies in the sheer lack of content. The devs have giving you the prolog for the story, and have failed to deliver on the rest of the game. If this was the demo, this game would be on my wish to play list. I would be eagerly awaiting the launch of the game itself.Its not though....Its the whole game...and i'm disappointed."

,Recommended,488770,31518073,Posted: 2 May,all,ElusiveOne,"Her Majesty's SPIFFINGis a delightfully self-aware pastiche of clichés specifically created for fans of 90's adventure games.The game looks very decent and makes excellent use of its dynamic camera to render its 3D environments in the most appropriate angle with proper depth of field, while retaining that classic adventure game feel. It's a slight innovation that gives it a particularly enjoyable uniqueness.Perhaps somewhat strangely for a title of this genre, it is obviously intended to be controlled with a gamepad, and surprisingly this works remarkably well for the most part. Only using the inventory proves slightly cumbersome, until you get used it, and there's always the more traditional mouse and keyboard alternative for the die-hards.The games' writing, humour and dialogue are dosed just right, abundantly breaking the 4th wall. The relatively vague story and inept main protagonist may certainly not break new grounds but are nevertheless entertaining. Laid-back and logical puzzles reward exploration and trying funny ideas without punishing players with failure or death, all very fitting with the theme.Excellent soundtrack.A very polished but unquestionably very short experience with about 3 hours worth of quality content at most. It ends a bit abruptly, making the overall plot feel very aimless and giving the impression of an incomplete slice of a larger, unfinished whole.For this reason alone I would recommend getting it on sale, but otherwise highly recommended. Here's hoping for a proper sequel!"

(as puzzles are logical in the game I was fairly sure it was a bug though)Other than that I liked it a lot, loads of funny references, silly humour and so on and so forth, I do have to say though that I could understand some people thinking it's a bit too short for the price but it didn't overstay it's welcome, it's so easy to make a game such as this too long to the point where the jokes just feel old... (for me I don't know if they ever would but... :) )I do hope they'll make a follow-up and now that I know of the dev's existence I'll keep an eye one them in case they'll go for another kickstarter."

It makes fun of itself whilst cramming enough game and movie references to choke a Gibbon. The game is also rather pretty at times which is an added bonus. The play time may be shortish but its the smaller details and the loveable characters which make this an enjoyable way to pass a few hours.

Great visuals and excellent voice acting coupled with plenty of poking fun at the various nationalities (stereotypical racism rules !) made this a very enjoyable experience.I found a couple of the puzzles a bit obscure hence the slightly longer playtime than some other players but got there in the end, 2 - 2.5 hours would seem a more realistic time for more experinced players of this genre. Plenty of achievments that will take a second play through to get 100% (unless you've already sneeked a peek at the guides.)My only gripe was that it was too short so I strongly advise you buy this game so the devs can continue their great work & make episode 2.Want to play more from these guys...9/10"

Puzzles were pretty easy. minimal interaction and  I don't know if the developer is British but the humour in this game is awful (Apart from a couple of groan moments) Being British myself I expected more. Also reading the reviews i thought it would be short. They really weren't kidding. This game is very vey VERY short. I was gobsmacked when it came to an end. Definitely not worth full price.

For the price of this game you could a) get an Adam Sandler comedy on DVD, b) leave it in the bank and accumulate 1p interest in oh.... say 10 years? or c) buy this game and spend two hours cracking up with laughter!  If you picked anything other than c for the love of god get your head examined!The gameplay on this was tight, the voice acting was brilliant (just a little campy just like the game itself perfect fit!) and the comedy was on point the whole time.  Assuming I dont get hit by a giant red double decker bus before a sequal comes out I would definitely buy it!  I just wish I had seen the kickstarter campaign to have backed it.  Really glad this was made and that I got to play it.On the basis of how the game runs I played this on Debian and can tell you it ran flawlessly so you would undoubtedly be fine on any Debian based operating system (e.g. Ubuntu / Mint)."
,Recommended,488770,30228654,Posted: 27 February,all,The Cuz,"This is a great little point-and-click game. If you're a fan of the genre you must play this. If you're also a fan of British humour and references to anything British you'll get even more out of this game. Even if you think obscure references to Robot Wars, Wallace & Gromit and Radio 4 might go over your head, still give this a shot.This game is full of some fine quips and sight-gags, and the quality is high for an indie studio.One or two gripes however:1) It's short. Like, Tom Cruise short. Almost feels like the game ends at the start of a non-existent Part 2.2) WAY too many Brexit references. I voted Remain, but even I was getting sick of all the Brexit-bashing going on.3) The game blocks quite a few achievements if you dare to explore.Items disappear if you successfully use them once, there are multiple solutions to a few puzzles, and some objects can be used successfully on different items to unlock hidden achievements. Do you see the problem yet? You're penalised for exploring, figuring out a valid solution, only to realise you needed that object later on to unlock up to THREE achievements. Only a nitpick, but this sort of thing is annoying and doesn't add length.Otherwise, a great point-and-click game with some genuine hilarious moments."

Her Majesty's SPIFFING is a much better game than many overhyped million dollar Kickstarter games I’ve played, so it was a surprising discovery, even more at a time when comedy adventure games doesn’t seem to be the most popular genre.Best part of the game, the narrative design. The characters are memorable, and the script writing is clever and hilarious. Nice details everywhere, on environments and sound design, and the expected doses of surrealism on every situation.Making a cohesive point and click game that guarantees an enjoyable experience from beginning to end is hard, but here puzzles run smooth, all elements and interactions are relevant, and you even get small variations on mechanics throughout the game.Oh! And it has personality! Her Majesty's SPIFFING is a parody in a way, and there are many allusions to video games and popular stuff, but it shapes its own world with appealing characters, animations, and dialogues.I actually don’t care that much about the length of the game. I enjoyed it a lot, and I prefer quality over quantity. However, it’s truth that it left me feeling hungry for more.

You can check that out here:Her Majesty's SPIFFING WalkthroughSo, I'll start with the negatives first since they're the detractors.  My biggest problem is that all of the puzzles are trivially easy, and just require a bit of dumb luck in determining if what you're doing is the right thing, or the wrong thing.  They don't naturally make sense all of the time, and are built around a bit of cartoony and childish solutions.  That being said, it's FINE!  I just personally wasn't expecting it.The other thing that I didn't like was the amount of back-and-forth required to do some seemingly minor things, or to check and see if what you did was the right thing.  Sometimes I just wasn't sure what the next step was or if I was even on the right track.  There's no indicator besides disappearing items as to whether or not what you're doing is the right thing.  That's ok, too!Not a bad list of things to NOT like, but the things I DO like definitely overrides that!  The humor really stands out as a success.  They continually poke fun at their own genre and ""lack"" of writers, if you will.  They poke fun of the game, from within the game.  In true British form, the humor was dry and subtle, but sure to put a smile on your face!The graphics were surprisingly on point!  I loved them, despite the seemingly low budget nature of the project!  They fit well, and made me feel good just playing the game.  I wasn't sacrificing any quality in that department just to enjoy some crappy jokes.Speaking of jokes: As a warning, some of the jokes lean a little outside of the G-Rated realm I expected.  Not that they are inherently adult, but if you are old enough to get the adult natured jokes, you will!  That's for sure!In summary, if you have a bottle of cheap wine and got this game through Kickstarter or on discount, you'll probably love it!  The old school point and click nature of it make it an at your own pace comic relief after a long day.  Try not to play it all the way through in one sitting, but you might do it on accident!  And for some reason, I hope there's a sequel!"

Very good graphics and music, and refreshing british humor.The game is a bit short, though (for which i understand the reason, given the rather tight finances). Which brings me to the price: Yes, it's a bit steep for 2-4 hours of gameplay (currently 12 Euros). But still cheaper as going to a movie, and much more enjoyable - and according to the developers, the money is going into development of Part 2, if enough people buy this installment.So, i can fully recommend buying this game."

However, being an expat from the UK, I found it very enjoyable and it brought back quite a few memories of being back in the empire :-)Some of the gadgets you come across in the game are definitely reminiscent, especially going back a few years :)Recommended purchase if you are into point and click story games and enjoy a little bit of banter between theBritishand theFrenchcultures.I don't often post reviews about the games I purchase but if this helps the team develop a longer version of this game then I'm all for it ... so what are you waiting for ... go buy it so they can :DIf you need any more of an incentive, the controller support is spot on so it's very easy to play from the comfort of the couch in front of the TV."

Speaking of suicide, let’s talk about Europeans and the game based exclusively off of a small yet frighteningly European group of them, the English.This game was downright hilarious and was so dry in its humor that Death Valley would be jealous. Chock full of political satire, sexually inappropriate britbong cheekiness, pop culture references and memes galore, Her Majesty's SPIFFING is about 30 minutes of much funny so laff, all in reference to Brexit and the nonsense before and after. Shout outs to just about every societal meme are in this game so if you paid attention to the world political and social landscapes in the past decade, you will more than likely have a sensible chuckle. Also, it's worth whatever lord Gaben decides its worth at the time you buy it. (Not that I'm defending his decisions, mind you) So pick it up and enjoy all the shenanigans.My rating; F V C K the French/10"

76561198011967833,Recommended,488770,31594454,Posted: 6 May,all,Aotrs Commander,"A short, but rather entertaining game. I found it extremely funny personally (though the metahumour and references might not be to everyone's tastes).The puzzles are not too difficult - I only got stuck once, near the end, but they also were not always immediately obvious; a good balance, then.The only real critism I can level against it would be the length. I could probably have wrung up another few minutes if I'd bothered to look at the achviements before finishing and attempted to do the other ones (which probably would have been worth a giggle or two for the no-doubt extra lines of dialogue), so a determined completionist might squeeze three hours out of the game. (Still, better to be short and well-executed than longer and unfinished and this was a kickstarted project.)A well-put together effort. I would certainly not be adverse to a sequel, should one ever be produced.I got this during a sale (as it was mentioned to me by a friend), but at full price for the length it might be a bit steep (it's more than a trip to the movies for about the same length of time), so bear that in mind if money/time investment is an important factor to you."

,Not Recommended,488770,35358568,Posted: 30 September,all,Masked Tondede,"I certainly like the visuals though the humor is quaint at best. Now it would be quite enough for me if there was a thorough adventure, but with two hours, I feel like I barely got a taste. For 20 euros that's just not enough, and it's rather annoying to have it smugly swept in your face by the writers. If there was about five times more content, I would have been quite satisfied. But this is just a demo marketed as a full product. CheckEvil Days of Luckless John if you want to know what I would expect this game to be like to justify its price tag."
