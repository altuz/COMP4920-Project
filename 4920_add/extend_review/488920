76561198142819669,Recommended,488920,29470975,Posted: 24 January,all,plano,"Updated review with latest content updateBelow the line is my initial review, here my new thoughts after having fought all enemies and tested the new 'Fitness' update:All 4 enemies are great and since the re-balancing feel a lot more fair and at the same time some attacks have become more challenging. Some fights can be difficult, but still feel fair at all times. The difficulty ramp is still here, but it got nerfed a bit, while the last enemy has gotten harder (which I appreciate as in the initial release he was too easy/weak).The developers have now implemented an alternate grip for the gloves which make them more similar to the default grip for Vive controllers in Thrill of the Fight. This allows a much more natural grip to punch the enemy. This change came after some community feedback, so they definitely do listen to the things posted here on the Steam forums.The latest content update has brought 2 mini-games to Knockout League: Focus Mitts and Speed Bag.Focus Mitts: my favorite new mini game where you have to land jabs, hooks, uppercuts in certain sequences as well as dodge attacks in the harder difficulties. There is easy, medium, hard and a stamina mode available right now. In the stamina mode you're only allowed to do 3 mistakes before losing. This mini game is exhausting in a good way. Great addition to the game!Speed bag: this one hasn't excited me that much. You have to punch a speed bag with a certain speed, either with your left, right or alternating both hands to score points. Again, there are 3 difficulty settings and one free punching mode. Not that exciting after one go. I wish they'd gamify that mode more.Conclusion: I can still recommend this game to anyone looking for a Punch-Out like boxing game. If you want a more realistic boxing game, I still recommend Thrill of the Fight like in my initial review. Both games have their places and I enjoy both.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Have you played Punch-Out in the past? This game is Punch-Out in VR!My first impression after having played through the tutorial, beat the 1st and 2nd enemy, and failed against the third enemy twice: fantastic game, achieves what it wants to do (Punch-Out in VR), highly polished visuals, very active combat.If you expect to get a realistic boxing game, then this isn't for you (there is an octopus as an enemy...an octopus!). But if you enjoy a pattern-recognition based arcade boxing game that requires you to pay attention, be quick on your feet/block reactively, then this game is for you!If you want a semi-realistic boxing game, then Thrill of The Fight may be a better game for you (can't recommend Kunlun Fighting, is significantly worse than Thrill of the Fight). This game and Thrill of the Fight stand in two separate game genre's even if they superficially seem to belong to the ""boxing"" genre.Knockout League allows you to dodge, however, you also have to counter quickly to get a hit in. The game doesn't require much space as it wants you to dodge sideways rather than backwards.You can also block enemies' attacks by timing it. If you block too early, you won't be allowed to counter back. This makes the game a lot more exciting!Currently the game's difficulty level is ramping up quickly and it is unlikely that you will be able to beat all enemies in one go. This is actually a good thing and you'll notice that with repeated matches that you simply get better and better to read the enemies' actions beforehand and overcoming such a challenge is always satisfying.There are still a few minor bugs I've encountered that are already mentioned in the early access page above.I can recommend this game to anyone that liked Punch-Out, likes more active VR games and people enjoying challenging fights.(This review will be edited after playing more of the game and if content patches change up the game significantly in the future)"
,Recommended,488920,32577040,Posted: 19 June,all,~Eden S B~,"I bought this game at full price. No regrets.It's exhausting to play, but really fun. It is very much like Punch Out for the Nintendo Wii which is obviously heavily takes inspiration from.Don't go into this expecting straight up boxing. Much like Punch Out, it's pattern recognition. You recognize what's happening based on the enemy movement and react accordingly, whether that's dodge in a certain direction, block or attack. You can only attack successfully at the appropriate times.The opponents are varied. The difficulty level is to the point where most will need a good amount of attempts to beat any enemy after the first, learning and getting better each time."

Went through the training, then got knocked out after a minute or so with the first fighter.Very good graphics, feels like a VR first person version of Street Fighter or something.I really wish it was possible to set the starting position in each fight, the default one fits my playspace very poorly and makes the game hard to play."

First, it is not room scale. You can not move around-- only duck. So why would it need room scale?Next, they promise 1:1 punching movements. Yes, it tracks your gloves nicely, but you aren't able to freely attack. You have to wait for pre-determined moves which repeat over and over then punch. The game would be more fun and has better replayability if it was more random and fluid. Pass."

Just as much exercise and immersion as Thrill of the Fight, but it feels like a full-on game with training area, some character customization, fleshed-out environments, etc.Also:  be ready for a workout like with Thrill of the Fight.  You'll be ducking, dodging and dancing even on the first fight."

This might be the best boxing game on HTC, and I really like ""Thrill of the Fight"".Review! Worth FULL PRICE! **gasp**"
76561198076518473,Recommended,488920,30891019,Posted: 1 April,all,mickeymousebullshit1976,I just noticed a fair amount of negative reviews which I find very shocking.  This is one of the best made games on the Vive.  Granted I can't get past the second fighter but it is so much fun!  I don't know what people expected.  If you loved Punch Out on the NES then you will love this game!  If you are looking for a boxing sim then look elsewhere.  But the gameplay is exactly as intended.  This is Punch Out in VR.  That is all you have to know.
,Recommended,488920,32851863,Posted: 27 June,all,Xariann,"I bought it as I read a few reviews saying it was a good workout. They were right! And it's a load of fun. Fighting opponents is a pattern recognition game, but you still need to do a good deal of punching, dodging and blocking. The training is actually the part I like most, probably because I bought this game with the idea that I would use it to make my workouts fun rather than fighting. It even keeps track of how many calories you burned, although I am not sure how accurate it is.I was surprised to see that the game would actually figure out from the speed of my punches whether I was putting any power behind them. So if you just want to casually place your hands in the right spot just to get the game to register that you ""threw a punch"" you are out of luck. You actually have to do the work.If you want to play it without causing yourself injury however, read a bit about shadowboxing, in particular how to pull punches, as if you don't try to stop your arm before you fully extend it you might hurt yourself.Anyway, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.EDIT 16 AUGUST 2017: Devs added new workouts, Reflex Alley being the one I find most fun. This has now become my favourite VR game from a fitness point of view.Aside from fighting against NPCs on the ring, here are the workouts you can do:1. Speed bag (can do it with weighted gloves if you want to up the game)2. Dodge drills3. Block drills4. Focus mitts5. Reflex Alley.The Reflex Alley will throw random objects at you, rather than in a pattern. It differs from some of the focus mitts drills since the workouts are never the same. You have a red glove and a blue glove and you need to hit water balloons. There are red and blue water balloons – ideally you want to punch them with the correct hand.You also get thrown a basket ball, which you are supposed to block and a weight which you want to dodge.The mode throws everything in the mix and there are 3 difficulties to choose from and an endurance mode.I own Box VR, and with the introduction of Reflex Alley in Knockout League I basically have no reason to play that other game as Knockout does the same thing and does it better (and does more things)."
76561198007663277,Recommended,488920,29474948,Posted: 24 January,all,Jewel_Runner_VR,Pros:- Punching is on point!- Blocking is on point!- Dodging is on point!- Opponents are really awesome!- Art style is great!- Excellent workout!- Amazingly optimized!Cons:- Boundaries can be a nuisance (devs fixed within 24 hours!!!)- Missing some content shown in the trailer (training mini games)- Only 4 fights so farOverall for an early access game this is a must experience. Dont expect this to give you too much playtime just yet. But what is here is definitely worth the experience. As i said this will now be one of my go to games for demoing my Vive to new people. Also cant stress how polished this feels. I played with supersampling up to 1.5 and i felt i could push it even further!
,Recommended,488920,29477308,Posted: 24 January,all,BloodyLombax,"Edited Due to update fixing everything.You can set how far forward or back you are now. My only reccomendation is maybe putting a little cicle or ghost of where your opponent will be when you are setting this. Otheriwse this was the exact fix I was looking for and honestly a lot of games, (Fruit Ninja for example) could use a similar option. Great work by the devs!FYI, I am working with the smallest allowed room space by Steam VR and I have plenty of space in front and behind me.Characters look great and solid, great sense of depth, runs well, functions as it says it does, with a minor bug here and there they already seem to be patching out.I have seen people complain that there are only 4 fights. Which is understandable. But the game is only $20, which by VR prices is low. Fucntionally it works. And, after just one fight, its exhausting. You do a lot of ducking, leaning, punching, and fights are longer than I expected. Honestly, 4 fights for me is okay, but maybe put in a hard mode where it takes 2x as long. I think I could be satisfied with that.I reccomended it before they patched it, and now it will be definitely be a game I will demo for friends trying VR. Its simple, functional, and fun."

The training modes work great as part of a cardio routine, and the fights, though cartoony and arcadey, will still challenge you and make you sweat.  The other big VR boxing game (Thrill of the Fight) may provide a more realistic boxing simulation, but I find Knockout League more engaging and fun.  I enjoy them both, but this is the game I keep coming back to day after day.Anyone who enjoys VR titles that get you active, or who wish that Super Punch Out was real life, don't hesitate to pick up this game."

,Not Recommended,488920,30303671,Posted: 3 March,all,Dralks,"I had a lot of fun with the 2 first fights, the blocking system of this game is excellent, the problem is that when you know how to beat an oponnent you will never lose as they always do the same attacks so after follow the sequence correctly you win, I guess that it will not be a problem when the game is complete with enough fighters, so I'm not giving a bad review for that.My review is due to the awfull dodge system, to dodge you have to go to a determinate direction, each enemy can attack from 5 directions and you can dodge to 5 directions, the game track your movement not your position so if you go to the correct side it will count as a dodge even if you get hit in game, but if you go to the wrong side it counts as a hit even if you are miles away fro the enemie punch. You cannot block the 3rd fighter and for me is almost impossible know how to dodge him, sometimes I get hit and sometimes I don't, I try to go to the logic side when I see him coming but I still get hit, I tried to beat him for 1 hour and end up frustrated because there is no way to use the logic when someone is spaming hits and you cannot dodge any of them,  you don't know if it is because you are going to the wrong side or you are doing a bad timing. I just give up and will return the game."

The soundtrack is typical Rocky inspired.Its not really what I expected though, and abit more free fight would have been nice. The dodging also requires ALOT OF MOVEMENT, making dodging very difficult. More difficult than in real life.Still I do recomend this game för kinds and ppl who like to practice both mind and body at the same time. You need to move alot!"

Even when you know what it takes to beat a guy it can still feel exahusting.  After playing a few rounds you get pretty tiered.While we have only beat the first 2 fighters it makes us hungry for more.  We are working on it, but it's tough enough that it's fun.It's easy to make a mistake and if you miss that dodge, you can be done for.  We absolutely love the game, and we think you will too if you are a fan of the old Punch Out games."

I was taken aback by how real it felt to stand toe to toe with people (AI).I recommend this game if for no other reason than the training modes, particularly the focus mitts. Its a hell of a workout and quite fun.That being said, the 'campaign' mode or whatever you want to call it is currently unfinished. It is challenging, but the bosses are heavily scripted. Once you learn the pattern you can beat them every time. But you cant go outside the pattern whatsoever, as they will instantly block or dodge your attack."

This needs to be a little more boxing and a little less Punch out on the Wii, dodging is bad, certain punches are spotty, crimson tiger the second fighter is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, sometimes you dodge, sometimes you hit, there is no reason, the devs say timing, but if thats the case the timing window is so small it doesnt even register a punch on a right hook into her face after you slip her windup, as my fist goes see threw and passes harmlessly through her only to reapear after Ive returned to a neutral stance, which the game also always reads as blocking, which would be fine if that didn't ""eat"" your block. We have 1:1 hand and head tracking damn't, use it. The game also needs to do a better job of explaining certain things, like why even though the punch was on the overside of the room it still hit, or that crimson is invicible unless staggered and that you have to hit her seven times in a row without getting hit to stagger her so you can hit her.Thats what makes this whole thing infuriating, this is a fun game, with good graphics and design, until you actualy get to the fighting... what does it matter if I can throw 2 left straights, a right upper cut and a hook if there is no point to doing those combination. The game works out more to dodge ('slip"") throw a right hook that sometimes works, if the npc is staggered unleash flurry of jabs. Also a major part of my issues is that the npc will be WIDE OPEN, but be invincible as its not time yet to hit them, so your fist just lightly taps them and they ignore it like the fly it is.If I haven't made my feelings clear by now, wait until this actual is finished before buying and if you want a actual 1:1 fight go play vanishing realms, it might be sword fighting, but dodging works, blocking works, and attacks and the directions of the attacks work and matter."

This game has no replay value. Like at all. In its current state there is no unlockables, and the 4 enemies take about 2-4 hours to learn and beat. After that theres nothing else to do.

76561197970872026,Not Recommended,488920,33043105,Posted: 30 June,all,VANDAL :OK_HAND:,"The asthetics to this game are excellent and initially quite fun until you start running into the flaws.In particular the dodge mechanics. It just feels so excessive in regards to how low you need to squat or move from side-to-side and it's impossible to 'out range' their punches. You basically just keep getting hit until you learn where exactly you have to go.The huge issue I have with the game is it's basically just a scripted encounter and you never feel like you're in control or winning the fight. It's always just wait for the tell, react, get your pre-determined amount of punches in and repeat until your opponent falls. If you throw a punch during down time you get absolutely no reaction/feedback at all which feels terrible.Your damage is also dependent on dodging so simply blocking a punch causes you to lose any momentum you've built up. This essentially makes the strength of your punches not matter as long as they're quick enough which is fine.The focus mitts training is essentially just 'memory' but with punching. I had fun initially up until they start throwing in subsequent dodges which lead me to just quitting because I could not dodge the 2nd dodge in a row whatsoever no matter what I tried. When you start to get to the longer 'combos' (e.g. 112134526) the time it takes for them to get across completely kills your momentum, shorter but more combos is so much more fun and realistic.I can see how many people may enjoy this kind of gameplay but if you've ever sparred or done any kind boxing class / pad work this game will not scratch that itch for you."

There are four total. I don't recall seeing a life bar. It seemed like you had to hit the opponent perfectly in a set sequence to knock him/her down. I prefer a life bar that you can whittle down over time. Assuming this gets more content, it's worth it.Update: I've played this for 1.2 hours and have beaten all four boxers and done the training twice.1st boxer: Beat twice on first attempt (update lost my save, so fought him again)2nd boxer: Took 3 attempts to beat3rd boxer: Took 3 attempts to beat (watched a guy beat him, then beat him myself)4th boxer: Took 1 attempt to beatEdit: They added a speed bag."

When it did I kept hearing a bunch of mixed things. My first impression of the game was great; the first fight was super fun and i was excited for the next one. After that it was just exhausting for me and it's when I came to the realization that this game is rhthym/pattern based. You can't land any hits unless its during a certain part of the pattern they run where they are vulnerable. I'd choose Thrill of the Fight over this one.

However, ther are things that are really frustrating with this game that I have decided to abandon it at the moment. The tracking is good enough, but it is as if the game is designed to allow you to hit the opponent only at specific moments, which totally changes your perception of the game, and changes fun into frustration. You see your gloves hitting the character's ungarded body parts, yet nothing happens, and the game only allows you to hit at specific time points, otherwize you waste your energy and build up sweat, much like punching thin air!"

Its early access and I think that it has really great potential.ProsNice Cartoon GraphicsVery ResponsiveComfort level is highImmersion is greatYou really do build up a sweatConsThe fighters punches are very limited and repetitive. Once you have played a character a couple of times , you know what punches to expect. They each only have 3-4 movesSome punches just don't register.  They are blocking but you come in below the block, hit them in the stomach and nothing. It ruins the immersion and gameplay. Easily fixed by having the opponent move his block, or take a hit.Very light punches still do damage. I think that softer and harder punches should register different with the boxer. You can beat an opponent easily just by tapping him.NO multiplayer- It could potentially be greatThe bare bones are there and I think that if the developers really put the effort in this could be a fantastic game. I wish I had waited for more some development before purchasing but these are the risks of early access."

The problem; the opponents follow a set pattern, and it's not varied, it's a short sequence where they build up to their attack, you then dodge or block and only then can you hit back. You throw a few punches and you repeat the process.It's not dynamic, you oberserve this obvious sequence and keep repeating until you win. This gets repetive quickly. Fine for the first hour, but hardly offering much longevity. Sure it's early access but you can see this is the mechanic they're going for here, where good graphics paper over a rather bland experience.Worth it for a fiver at best."

Yes, that's right, you can *only* counter them!  Also, the game is not room scale.  You are required to stay in a specific area of the ring and wait for them to come to you.  If you exceed their boundary limits, the game will halt.For a game that advertises ""1:1 punch movement that lets you attack how you want."", that's a total load of baloney.  They will block every jab you take at them.Basically, you must read their super-slow telegraphed attack, remember what you're required to do (dodge, punch, or block) and then swat at them quickly and aimlessly like a catfight.  Forget about perfectly executed hooks, uppercuts, overhead smashes, body blows, etc.There's also something weird about the game: There are only four opponents, and the coach and first two weakest opponents are all black: an old black coach, a huge dumb Mike Tyson-like boxer and a black ""jungle woman"".  Wouldn't it be weird if the first three characters you encountered in a game were all Slavic, or Latino, or Asian, or [fill in a random race here]?  It would be different if the remaining two boxers were of somewhat proportional balance, but instead we have a white pirate and a octopus.  So we have three black people, a white pirate, and an octopus to punch at.  It struck me as a bit weird, like a stereotype of who participates in boxing.  I'll let you come to your own conclusions.If you want an uninteresting reaction game, this is your game.  If you want a boxing game, get Thrill of the Fight.  I had such high hopes for this, but it's a child's game pretending to be about boxing."

Works great with the Rift, it doesn't seem to use the 3rd sensor, so if you're having 360* tracking issues (360 tracking is still in experimental phase at this point so give Oculus a break) I don't think it matters here. I didn't have the need to turn around at all in the first two fights. So if it does come to it in the final two fights, I'll update the review. At this point, you're good with two sensors 180* tracking (which isn't a problem on the Rift) and you're fine with 3+ sensors because it doesn't seem to need the back sensors at all.It seems really early access at this stage. Only 4 opponents, and it's really just a, ""Memorize their pattern"" game. If you don't block or dodge at that time you don't get an opening and the opening is just on punch until you get enough punches to daze the opponent in which you get to do muliple punches on them. It's incredibly basic at this point, and if it wasn't in VR it'd be a terrible game!It has a ton of potential, I recommend it. And please don't refund it, the developers need to continue developing this game. It needs variety in fighting style and it needs to not be a scripted fight, meaning they do the same thing over and over until you memorize what they're gonna do."

And don't be fooled by the videos - this game might look ""cute"" but it is intensely physical to play, and feels viscerally violent. If it were too much more realistic it might be too much, really.Opponent sophistication: I've unlocked the second opponent-character so far, and haven't managed to beat her after several attempts (which doesn't get old because after every time you manage to hit her enough times in a row to daze her, she adds another set of moves to her repertoire).Exercise factor: I find as I get really into this, it starts to feel natural to put real force behind the punches, all of them. When I'm doing it, my brain thinks I'm actually fighting (despite the fact my opponent is this sort of early-Pixar-looking crude 3D model). This definitely elevated my heart rate and breathing to levels consistent with a hard sprint, and kept it there - to the extent that I start getting hit because fatigue or lack of breath is slowing down my reaction times. Also, despite being pretty athletic I find my shoulders, traps, and obliques are extremely sore after about an hour of play. Also my feet.Experience/realism: The haptic feedback is extremely well timed with the sound effects and the visualization of the impact (theopponent jerking back, etc). I can't quite describe how visceral it is. You really get this jolt of adrenaline and a sense of satisfaction when you land a hit, or especially a series of hits. This is an extremely well put together melee combat mechanic that motivates real physical investment in the fight while also requiring quick thinking to figure out how to beat opponents.Room scale / other considerations: I am fully utilizing my play space dodging and rushing not just with my body but with my feet. A lot. If you wear shoes, you'll make a LOT of noise. If you wear socks, you slide around. Barefoot, I had best footing. But be warned, if you aren't used to that, the fast lunges and dodging around will be very hard on the feet - particularly around the edges and the pads of the toes (blisters or friction burns on all of them).I'm really looking forward to beating this person so I can see what interesting characters the other two early access characters are like. GREAT GAME!Now ---- the wishlist:1. Multiplayer. Obviously. I don't care if I can't see my opponent's legs, or they don't have special moves. Just the block/rush/dodge/duck/swing mechanism is enough (with voice chat...that's really essential) to let people interact in this way.2. At some point, you're going to need to have the characters start learning. I suggest you have them start throwing the player's own punches at them (exactly the glove movements relative to their head...when they reach a certain proximity). And then record how the player reacts (how they move to dodge it, or if they block it, and what kind of follow up punch they attempt). And then have the character make exactly that reaction when a similar punch movement is tracked. You might have to slow it down a bit (at least when first introducing the move) and gradually speed it up. Then the player will actually be learning good reflexes.3. Special moves. Pleeeeease? With really cool special effects and the announcer calling it out, etc. It doesn't have to be unrealistic street fighter stuff (though...wouldn't that be fun). Just cool things similar to what the characters get. Like an unblockable punch (with a long wind-up). Or a fast combo (that your trainer teaches you at some point, when you unlock it) that makes your gloves catch on fire.4. Why don't WE get to be announced and have some cool showboating gimmick that the crowd goes wild for? When I saw we were picking our nicknames by selecting one word from each of two lists, I thought that was the idea (since you could combine ""Beast"" (roaring) with ""Wicked"" (with hellfire or a pentagram or something) so that when the announcer calls ""in this corner, the Wicked Beast"" I'd see flames rising around me in a star shape and a load roar. Or whatever.Anyways, I hope any or all of those end up part of the completed game. I'll definitely be playing this in easy access while I wait!"

You have to time the trigger holds perfectly.The graphics and presentation are better than most VR games out there. The music, opponents and the atmosphere design are pure eye candy.
