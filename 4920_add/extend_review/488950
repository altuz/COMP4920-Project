76561197981717362,Recommended,488950,28230513,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,Pyrokite,"If you have ever played the Mafia game using a deck of cards or have the Werewolf set you know exactly what this game is. It is a clever social game where the werewolves attempt to allude the villagers for one night, and everyone has to figure out who the werewolves are. There are multiple roles, but not enough where it is clunky or too complicated. I am used to playing the old Mafia version with a deck of cards so coming in to this game I am used to having multiple nights where people are voted out every night, where this game differs is it only has one night and one vote.I think this is a good step for the game, because it keeps everyone involved and does not risk fracturing the servers when people inevitably quit out because they were killed. The rounds feel like the perfect amount of time. So far the population of this game seems to be good, I had no problem finding a full server and played with some awesome people, laughing and having a great time as we all attempted to persuade each other to further our own agendas. I am using the VIVE and I thought it was brilliant that Ubisoft is offering Crossplay between Oculus and PSVR. There still is Uplay you have to deal with, which personally does not bother me but may bother some of you.I was a little dissapointed that I could not use my VIVE controllers to move my hands 1:1. You use the controllers to select emotes and gestures you can make, which still felt pretty fluid. The game has many clever features, such as if you stand up to plead your case it temporarily mutes the other players so they hear your case.Overall, yes I agree the price might be a bit high for some people, and I do worry that long term it might hurt the player base, but as it stands right now I reccomend this game. I truly felt like I was with a group of friends laughing and having a great time and that is what VR is about for me."

At the moment I won't reccommend."
,Recommended,488950,28238453,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Harvester of Sorrow,"So I've been looking at this game to be released for a couple months now, but like most of you I was shocked and turned away from the $30 price tag ($40 for someone of you on different points on the globe).  After a couple beers I said F it and bought the game.The game is amazingly fun.  The art direction and the world it created is a fun and enjoyable atmosphere to be a part of.  Everything is well polished and the game is simple enough for anyone to jump in and start playing.Right away I was paired up with 6 other guys who I got to spend the next 3 - 4 hours with.  It was such a BLAST try to deceive everyone or try and convince them of who you TRULY (or falsely) are or are not.  Other than the game objective itself, it was so much fun interacting with one another, doing all sorts of gestures, making all sorts of jokes, and, overall, just being part of a new community and getting to know one another.  It's an amazing social experience and I don't think I ever laughed so hard in a VR game (one guy said he was laughing so hard, tears were getting in his headset).Despite being incredibly fun, is it worth the $30 ($40) price tag?  Sadly I'd say no.  While it is an awesome experience and a fresh game mechanic to the Vive database, because of it's high price I don't see many people getting on board and thus I believe the player base will soon decrease (which is common for online only games).  Which is a shame, that the price of the game is going to be it's poison and greatest contributor to it's lack of success.  While it is great being able to play with other players across Vive, PSVR, and Oculus, it's going to be impossible to maintain a steady player count unless price is addressed.  I recommend giving the game a try when it's on sale.  With the amount of polish and creativity I would say this is more of a $15 game.TL;DR  Amazingly fun polished game with great atmosphere and addictive gameplay, but with a hefty price tag that, unless decreased, will starve the player count."

The scenery is like being in a Tim Burton movie mixed with a ride at Disney World.  The name of the game?  Lying to strangers about what you are.  No two games are the same and the head tracking and voice are astounding.  It does require a controller but, this is the most immersive game I've played to date.  Cross platform between PSVR, Vive, and Rift so there's always someone to play with!  The community for this game is the best I've experienced since vanilla WOW and Halo CE.  Don't be turned off by the $$.  I've gotten my $$ worth in the 7+ hours I've played it.  Can't wait to see more social games like this!9/10I subtracted one point for Ubisoft's server issues on other games.

,Recommended,488950,28266971,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,Phelzier,"Some people may be scared away because of the price tag, it does seem quite high for a game with not much content.  I guess you could be right, maybe a £15 price tag would be more realistic.  If you have 100 Uplay Club points, you may be able to get 20% off if you can actually get Uplay to issue the voucher.I've been playing this on Vive, not sure if the Oculus version is out yet, so this review is based on my experience using it with the Vive.GameplayThe game itself is noting new.  I've not played Mafia, but I've played a lot of Town of Salem.  There are 11 roles consisting of:Werewolf - Lean left/right and sniff player role while whispering.  Objective - Don't get caught.  Find the Saint.Villager - Can vote for a Ring Leader, who get's two votes.  Objectiver - Find a WerewolfTracker - Can track either left or right half of players.  Will tell you either no Werewolves or one or more of them could be.  Objective - Find WerewolfWatcher - Stare are at a player to learn two possible roles.  One is correct.  Objective - Find WerewolfTurncloak - You win if the Werewolves win.  Objective - Help Werewolves win, even if it means you die.Drifter - Shows in the Manual two roles that are not in play - Objective - Find WerewolfSaint - Pray to show you the Werewolves in game.  Objective - Find Werewolf.  Don't get voted by a Werewolf.Astrologer - Look to the stars to to find two roles that are in play.  Objective - Find Werewolf.Houndsman - Same sniffing ability as Werewolf.  Objective - Find WerewolfGossip - Learn a role of two random players.  First appears after 15 seconds, the other after a minute or two.  One is true, one might be true or false.  Objective - Find Werewolf.Deviant - Objective - Get voted for to be killed.4 Win Conditions1. Deviant is eliminated - Deviant Wins2. Saint is eliminated or all Werewolves vote for the saint - Werewolves Win3. If a Werewolf is eliminated - Town Wins4. If only Townsfolk are eliminated - Werewolves WinThe game plays well once you get a good bunch of people.  The majority of players seem to be on the PS4, but this doesn't make any difference to the game whatsoever.  You actually get some good banter with people once you've played a few games with them, although you need to weed out the people who don't seem to want to speak on a game about being social.All the games I've been have been in English, I assume that Uplay have different servers for different languages based on the country you are registered in, but some there are non-english speaking countries in there too like Russia as an example.The issue with this regionalisation is that if you are not playin in peak time for your country, between 4pm and 1am, then you may struggle to get a game going and will spend ages sitting and waiting for people to join.  Maybe some kind of mini game of something would be good whilst you're waiting.There are a few bugs that I have seen with the Vive version.1.  The tutorial theatre doesn't work2. If you join a game as a spectator your Vive controllers don't work.  You can use the space bar to click instead.That's all for now.  I'll do an update to this a bit later on, but I gotta run."
,Recommended,488950,28832910,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Messenger,"My favorite VR game, and has outpaced all other games I need to play from this season.Seriously, you know when you have a huge backlog but you can't stop playing that one game? Werewolves Within is that game."
,Recommended,488950,28818601,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Pandadogg,"If you've played Town of Salem, you'll know exactly how this game works. There are fewer roles but the VR immersion is crazy real. Leaning in to speak to someone works really well, especially when you see there's lip synching for whenever anyone talks and the game tries to figure out your mood and throws up subtle hand gestures on its own, as well as manually allowing you to fire off gestures. This game is also crossplay between PSVR, Vive, and Oculus so Uplay is needed to handle the cross-play elements.The downside is that it works only with a gamepad controller for the Vive and its a seated experience. Not that adding movement would help in a game like this, but being able to use the motion controllers would be nice. The price is a little high, but I'm okay paying extra for polished VR experiences.I want to point out that if you want to get good at this game you must be able to fake your way through being a 'power' role when you're a werewolf, turncloak, or deviant. You need to be able to impersonate a watcher, tracker, houndsman, or astrologer.  In rounds where no one does this the werewolves tend to lose or the round just gets boring. I can't stress enough that this game is built on actively deceiving others and if you just sit there and pretend to be a do-nothing villager when you have an evil role, then you may not like the game. This really isn't an issue with the game as much as it an issue with people not playing it properly.Highly recommended! Its a lot of fun and quite the time waster. I thought I played 30 mins or so, only to realize I played 2 hours!  I met some fun people and hope to play with them again soon.Note: The 1.1 patch from a couple weeks ago fixes a lot of the issues older reviews mention. It was largely bug-free for me and the group I played with."

,Recommended,488950,29330453,Posted: 17 January,all,PizzaParadox,"The most replayable game for the Vive so far. Werewolves Within is a game of bluffs, logic, and pure luck that requires knowledge of how every role in the game works independently and in tandem. Each round plays differently even if stay with the same group of people. The theming, animations,  and music all come together to form a unique experience for a considerably old party game. The community is somewhat small yet mostly dedicated to playing by the rules and the occasional troll or hyper-active kid can be kicked if the group desires. Every so often I've experienced audio issues where another player's mic is choppy, but this only lasts for a few seconds and has never impacted a game.I would say this game is well worth the price as I can see myself playing many times over.P.S. winning as the Deviant feels amazing, good luck."

Wasn't sure this would work that well both because a new type of VR experience and risk of troll player community. But about 24hrs in and over 9nhours of playtime shows that concern was misplaced. The community so far is fairly small but growing and no trolls experienced so far, and lots of good humour, laughs and who-dunnit mystery type party play. It takes a few games to learn the various roles and you probably will make some initial silly mistakes but you will learn quickly and probably get some laughs from others about it. It's expensive for a VR games but definitely worth the money and cross-play with PSVR means a greater pool of players. Some sound issues which mean having to ask people to repeat things but understand an update is due to fix this and it's occasional rather than all the time. If you want a very entertaining VR party game then there is nothing else like this at the moment. Buy it."

Everything I can hear fine besides other people. Its like I can hear them good for a good 5 seconds and then they get choppy and I can't hear them for a good 5-7 seconds. I'm not sure if it is the cross-platform communication too blame, but I feel like it is because every game I'm in is 100% PSVR users while I'm using the Vive. But I managed to get through many games with the amount of voices I do hear.So with that being said, this game will definately make you lose track of time and have you thinking, ""Maybe just one more game..."" Over and over again. Just make sure you know what each role do because one mistake and the whole group will kill you. When in doubt, you're a villiger."

For a $30 price tag, there isn't enough depth, not enough roles, and roles don't have unquie features really. The game desperately needs motion tracking but doesn't have it. It being on other platforms as well like PSVR makes it suffer from bad microphone quality which is crucial to the game. It seems the $30 price tag was only slapped on because it is also for PSVR and control pricing scheme dictates it pretty much be higher cost.It is fun, but nowhere near the value of $30, it should probably be around $10 for the content and quality of what you recieve."
