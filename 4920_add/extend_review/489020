GOOD GAME! hahaI was looking on steam for a fun time waster game because so many games are on sale, I didn't want the same boring old games that I always see, then I came across iGrow Game and thought it would be fun to play a game like this, so I got it not expecting much, but I'm surprised it's better than I thought!The basic gameplay is good, it has a cool theme, standard first person controls. It runs really well @ 60fps, has unique graphics, and has some video setting in the menu to make it run better if your PC isnt that good. You can speed time up to make the plants grow faster, keep your basic needs up like sleep, eat, drink, and you have a cool apartment building to roam around in.iGrow has 2 game mode settings, survival mode, or normal mode. In survival mode you have to Eat, drink, and sleep. The cops can also show up if you fail to meet your needs and they take EVERYTHING so you have to start from scratch. In normal mode you don't have to worry about any of that and can just grow at X10 speed and make huge XP and money.iGrow has tons of upgrades and customizations for the rooms and equipment to help your plants grow as big and potent as they can so when you sell to the dealers located on different floors of the apartment you can get the most money and XP for your grows.The music and sound effects are GREAT. iGrow as a whole is a great example of a chill game.UPDATE 12/16/2016iGrow just got an update that fixes some bugs, add's a new Christmas Gold strain, a new cross breeding feature that allows you to mix and match any unlocked strain to create a new strain, and also now you can level up to 50!I look forward to see what the Dev has planned for updates to make it even better."

There are some bugs and the user interface feels sluggish at times, but when you watch your plants grow and grow it really pays off. In Late Game you can probably sit back with a beer and watch your plants grow by themselves until they need to be cut down and dried, while chatting with other Users over the inbuilt chat.In the end it´s something like a cookie clicker, just in 3D and Weed instead of Cookies.If you like slow paced games and watching grass grow (literally) then this is def. a game for you!"

There are dealers, there are aluminum foil walls, there are hemp seeds (and that's how I knew, because I even refuse to buy hemp shampoo out of fear that it will make me a drug addict and I don't think that's ok). This is a disgrace and I don't believe that such a vulgar game should be on steam. Hey, why don't you promote a game about murder next??? HUH???? Exactly it sounds ridiculous!

Game keeps crashing if you go into settings, and then try to exit out after adjusting. Game glitched on me after one of the crashes, and then reset all of the tasks that had already been done - but kept my purchases etc.  So now I have to start a new game, and hope it works this time. The game has crashed on me several times just trying to load it.I do not see any way of deleting any profiles you create, and there are only 3 save slots....so if it glitches you are just screwed. If you have a bad grow you can't sell it, and I have (as of yet) been able to find a way to trash it. Another glitch I experienced is a plant died on me, but I couldn't trash the plant. It just told me it was dead, and gave me the option to cancel.I am sure this COULD be a fun game....IF you could play it without the glitches, without the crashes, if you were able to adjust the gamma so you could see where youu were going, and if a few other things were either put into the game - or werre explained how to do better. At this point it was not worth the money spent on it - not even at 83% off.....sad as I was looking forward to playing this...."
