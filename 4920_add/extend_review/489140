It lasts two hours, which is just the right amount to keep you adrenaline-pumped the entire time and finish on a high note.The only downside (but it's a big one) is the price. I'm fine with a 15-euros 2-hour game, but only if it has high production value, and this game just cuts too many corners : few musical tracks, few environments, only 2 dialog NPCs with one facial expression each...It has a lot of replayability if you aim for the no-death achievement, but replaying a 15-minute level because I got hit once sounds too frustrating for me to even attempt. If that's your thing, I recommend this game. Otherwise, wait for a discount."

76561198254009895,Recommended,489140,32569815,Posted: 19 June,all,thegav777,"It's a fun top-down arcade-style game. For what the game sets out to achieve, I think it does well. The teleportation mechanic is the centrepiece of the game, and it reinvents itself throughout. Depending on the level it can feel more actiony or more puzzly. But it's mostly action and reflex oriented, with a flavour of stealth, and some room for strategising against the enemy. The storyline isn't the most original, but the writers are clearly aware of that as the story makes fun of itself constantly. It reads more like a parady of an action movie. The game isn't particularly long. I've completed it with 7 hours on the clock, but it can be done quicker than that. For a game that tracks how fast you have completed each level and the number of times you have died, I thought that it would have a leaderboard built into the game, but there doesn't appear to be one. I have found other websites which track that, but I think intergrating it would have been a nice touch. The soundtrack is well produced and fits the game style perfectly, but does tend towards the repetative side. In terms of replay value, there isn't much - unless you're into speed runs, but that's not for me. Overall, I enjoyed the game. If you're looking for a fast-paced singleplayer arcade-style game, definitely consider this one."
,Recommended,489140,31201296,Posted: 17 April,all,Marik Bentusi,"Mr. Shifty is a short (5h) and sweet cheeky top-down brawler with a fast pace and focus on improvisation. Although it shares some similarities with Hotline Miami, the melee and teleport focused gameplay sets it suffiently apart.Could benefit from a level editor (+Workshop).GameplayThe rules of Mr. Shifty are simple: Punch everyone in the face. Use your short-range teleport to get into punching distance and circumvent environmental hazards. Clear the room of goons and proceed to the next one. You fail and need to restart the room if you get hit at all.It's the details of these mechanics that give Mr. Shifty's gameplay a very aggressive character: The short-range teleport operates on a charge-based system that recovers after a few milliseconds or after punching people. Disposing goons quickly earns you a supermode that triggers in near-death scenarios to slow the world around you and grant you almost limitless teleport charges. You can pick up weapons, but they're all melee ones and break after a few hits.So unlike in Hotline Miami, Mr. Shifty's gameplay isn't about peeking and shooting. It's about getting in there and quickly punching people in the face.Side note: Failing a room repeatedly will grant you the bullet time supermode from the start, which I think is a cool way of lowering difficulty without ridiculing the player by granting them a chicken hat or asking them if they'd like to play on Easy Mode. Prove that you can play the room well and the free supermode won't even need to kick into action.Level Design & EnemiesThe levels and the enemies placed within it contribute just as much to the Mr. Shifty experience as the gameplay rules.All enemies either engage in melee or use projectile weapons, and all attacks have at least a brief telegraphing attached to them, which means you can always teleport-dodge attacks and makes the game feel fair even when it gets difficult, which is quite important when you die in one hit.Enemies also have a reasonable aggro range, so you'll never get sniped from across the room without realizing there were enemies there. Enemies need to turn around before they can hit you, which might not seem like a big deal, but since it incentivizes flanking people and being smart about your teleports, it makes you feel a lot slicker!Level design gets increasingly more complex and the game keeps throwing new types of enemies at you until near the end of the game. Although the game doesn't feature (mini-)bosses per se, it does a good job of occasionally throwing in a harder floor that serves as a test for everything you've learned so far. Although a good chunk of Mr. Shifty revolves around punching people in the face, the game also mixes things up with sections that mostly focus on evading level hazards such as lasers and exploding barrels. It even features a few very short stealth sections, and destrucible terrain adds even more depth and possibilities to most rooms.The hand-picked enemy choices give a lot of rooms character. For example, a room may feature lots of melee aggressors and two enemies armed with rocket launchers. One way of dealing with this would be to prioritize the rocket launcher guys and then focus on the crowd of brawlers, but you can also kite the crowd and let the rocket launcher guys blast their comrades to pieces before you turn your attention to them.This room could have been completely generic, but smart enemy choices made it a compelling little experience with its own character.Because a lot of games these days pseudo-randomly spawn enemies and stitch together levels, Mr. Shifty's deliberate level design and enemy placement is a breath of fresh air.Unlike Hotline Miami, Mr. Shifty's level design, enemy variety and gameplay also allow for multiple different approaches to clearing levels, whereas in Hotline Miami levels could often feel like puzzles. Like you need to find out all the steps towards the solution and then choreograph it all perfectly. Mr. Shifty is much more about aggressive improv and attacking a problem from different angles.GraphicsI'm not a big fan of the ""old school comics"" art style myself, but it does a good job at setting the light-hearted tone and is very functional when it comes to making everything important stand out from the background, including the player character, which is invaluable in a game where you'll be teleporting all over the place constantly. It also does a nice job at characterizing each enemy type, so you'll never be confused about what you'll be up against, which is quite important since the gameplay encourages you to aggressively jump into action and improvize.The voice com avatars could have used some more work in my opinion. There's only one per character (your ally, the enemy boss, and occasionally the silent Mr. Shifty himself) with the occasional variant that zooms in a bit, which gets boring pretty quickly and doesn't support the dialogue very well, which already doesn't have voiceover.Basically it's no Mark of the Ninja, but it's all very functional.Music & SoundMusic's pretty nice and sound effects pack a good amount of punch. Nothing that sounds exceptionally satisfying and no memorable tracks. But for context, I rarely find soundtracks as memorable as a lot of other people.Story & Narrative (no spoilers)Kinda flat even for the simple little thing that's all it wants to be.The game tries not to take it too seriously, but mostly does so by winking at the Fourth Wall a lot, which got kinda annoying to me. There's kind of a tone shift between beginning and finale towards the more serious, but not so much that it becomes jarring.The two characters, your obligatory voice com support lady and the main villain, try to be endearing through their quips and over-the-top scenes, but don't really succeed. Voice acting or more emotive voice com avatars could have helped a lot here, especially since the characters always look fairly serious but often pull out cheesy puns or lines like ""That's a terrible plan. Count me in."" Mr. Shifty himself especially comes across as stoic and serious due to his dialogue that amounts to ""..."" and an avatar seem from the back, face covered in shadows. Considering how wild the gameplay is and how cheesy the writing gets, the protagonist seems oddly serious and detached.IMO it would have been better to cut the voice com lady and give the protagonist some personality and motivations of his own. Maybe just a cocky thief that wants to get away with stealing from the biggest bad guy around. Barely slipping between the bad guy's fingers could have been what the protag greatly enjoys and what really pisses off the villain.On that note, the villain does a lot of ""you see me in this level, but I'll vanish in a cutscene before you can even touch me"" disapperaing acts in the game. Kinda got annoying. Especially since the power fantasy makes *me* want to be the guy that taunts the villain by briefly appearing but always being too glib to catch.All that said, the story is always very clear about your current objective and how it contributes to the bigger goal. The endingis clear, but kinda lacks a bit of ""you did it! now let's chill at HQ, beer's on me"" type of celebration. There's no eleventh hour superpower per se, but supermode-punching the villain felt really good, especially since once again you needed to flank him, which as I described above makes me feel real slick!Bugs & Performance (i5+GTX660)I rarely experienced some chugging when levels got crowded with goons and explosions. I had one crash, which was preceeded by occasional stutter regardless of on-screen clutter, but couldn't repro it. Due to the teleporting shenanigens, once in a blue moon objects would overlap and spazz out.Game about teleporting, huh? Do you ever get to telefrag someone?No, sadly you don't. :("

Great gameplay hook, lots of enemy types and some neat puzzles make this an easy game to recommend. It's loads of fun and very empowering."

,Not Recommended,489140,32858305,Posted: 27 June,all,AchtBitKeks,"Good concept with some big problems(would rate between good and bad if it was possible)It's a good concept and the gameplay feels pretty good BUT the game feels streched like a warm bubblegum and the level/checkpoint-design has a big issue:You die in ONE hit and then you'll have to replay the whole room you died in, and in some cases (especially towards the end of the game) these rooms are very big and have either long arena like fights or many enemy group encounters and dieing sometimes feels just random.EDIT: that's not the reason for the dislike, it's just something I don't like that muchBesides that if you quit you have to replay the whole chapter you are in which wouldn't be that much of a problem if the game wouldnt crash, which happened quite a few times. (In one case the END-Boss in the LAST lvl killed me and then it crashed now i have to play the last chapter again and it's the most annoying one -_-).So if these issues get fixed It's worth trying it out.But to be honest you should buy it in a sale, atleast that's what I think.EDIT:Like I said""that's what I think""dieing feels sometimes random and the parts you have to redo are a bit too longin some levels but that's just my opinion and not the reason for the dislike.The crashesare the major problem here. If they get fixed its actually a pretty nice game.Imho there should be a rating between good and bad because it really isn't bad."

,Not Recommended,489140,34313357,Posted: 17 August,all,icn,"tl;drGreat gameplay premise and controls are held back by almost everything else, most of all boring level design. If still interested, only buy on sale>50% off.---Mr. Shifty is one of those games I would rate as neutral, if I had the option to do it.The premise is quite obviously pretty cool: Hotline Miami with superhuman strength and Nightcrawler's teleport ability. I'm sold. Right from the start it is clear that this mixture works and is translated perfectly into entertaining gameplay by the responsive controls. So far, so good.Sadly, Mr. Shifty's premise suffers from a lot of problems other areas of the game's design cause. Despite the good controls and awesome powers the game becomes pretty dull for large parts of its campaign. This is due to uninspired level design that will not challenge you for a majority of the time, the ony exception being some stages were the devs just throw more and more enemies your way. This only changes in the last few levels were some interesting new mechanics are introduced and you are not just challenged by the sheer number of enemies but also get some genuine ideas thrown in your gears, those parts easily provided the most fun I had with the game. But even the later levels hold some frustration based on questionable design decisions: You don't have the option to safe after reaching a checkpoint, instead you have to start over if you quit before finishing a level. This would not be a problem if the levels had a similar length to the ones in early or midgame, but thanks to the ""difficulty-through-numbers"" approach the levels are often three times as long. Also for a game that has a linear campaign of about 4 hours the amount of backtracking I had to do inbetween was at least slightly irritating.Another negative is the implementation of ""story"" (if you can call it that) into the game. The dialogues are poorly written and can not be skipped. Even when they are supposed to be cheesy fun, they are not. There is a lot of cringe you have to sit through. That aside, the prompts also bring the flow of the game to a full stop, killing all the momentum you had. You finish a room, rush forward, ready to fight and... you get a cringey text with irrelevant drivel you can't skip. Oh, I'm finished. You're allowed to fight now. Have fun... and don't forget your lunch! PS: Someone you don't care about.Those design complaints out of the way, I also encountered some minor glitches and performance drops that should not happen on my system.I think Mr. Shifty would've benefited a lot from longer developement. At the moment it feels unfinished, almost like a proof of concept to show that its basic premise can work, while everything else is just thrown in half-heartedly. As I said in the beginning the basics really do work, and they are fun - the developers really were onto something here, but that is about it.In conclusion I think Mr. Shifty could've been a lot better than it turned out to be and its current price tag does not fit quality nor quantity of the product. That is why I will not recommend the game. However, if you are still interested, I suggest buying Mr. Shifty on sale with at least a 50% discount."

That being said, I wish there was more to it, just because it is that fun. The concept is simple, hotline miami with teleporting. Minus the gore factor and drug trip HM brings. The fast-paced music keeps you pumped up for each section of the game, and makes you feel ready to face Mr. Stone's men head on. I died a lot on my first playthrough, but the game tracks your best time, and least amount of deaths seperately. Ultimately you want to aim for zero deaths in each level, while still going as fast as you can. I see this game being a great speed game for casual players and more serious speedrunners as time goes on. I know I will pour hours more into this game trying to perfect the last several levels, all of which make the first dozen or so floors seem like a cakewalk. Good luck to anyone trying to get the deathless or speedrunning achievements.Pros+Great Soundtrack+Great Controls+Quick intense gameplay+Witty writing+Felt like a badass while playingCons-Length. The game only took me almost 3 hours to beat on my first playthrough. Wish there was more to it.-Occasional bugs.

,Not Recommended,489140,33154847,Posted: 2 July,all,ReMeDy,"Mr. Shifty is a game with a unique concept weighed down by shallow development. It's close to being a perfect game, but some things dramatically set it back.The technical issues are appalling given the game's simple graphics. The game crashed twice, and when it does, you must restart the entire level. Various comments have attested to these crashes. Thankfully, each level only lasts an average of 9 minutes, but for such a simple looking game to crash not once, but twice, is unforgiveable. Second, despite my strong desktop PC, the game occassionally suffers from micro stutters in the game's second half when there's more enemies and explosions. In a game of one-hit instant deaths, these stutters compromise the gameplay's theme of fast-paced action, and may get you killed.The characters are incredibly shallow. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but regardless, you never find out why Mr. Shifty has his powers. Furthermore, Mr. Shifty is a silent protagonist, so there's nothing compelling about him, other than his mysterious superpowers of unknown origin. Silent protagonists can work when they're surrounded by interesting characters, but the only two characters we have -- Nyx and Stone -- provide no backstory and don't complement the protagonist. Nyx's commentary is basically dry one-liners to make your eyes roll. Stone is no better and is akin to Diablo III bosses who won't shut their mouth as Mr. Shifty traverses each level.The game has no end-game content. There's no survival mode, no level editor, no trial modes, no time attack, no extra difficulty settings... nothing. When you complete the story, you're kicked to the main menu and left to wonder what to do next. What's worse, the single player can be completed within 8 hours, and that's despite the fact I died about 200 times.I enjoyed my time with the game, but whether I would recommend this game or not is a tough decision. Despite the interesting teleporting mechanic, it doesn't compensate for what feels like an incomplete game needing more time in development."
,Recommended,489140,31136242,Posted: 14 April,all,clippa,"Fun Hotline Miama style top down brawler with a teleportation mechanic. Not enough content to justify the price but what there is of it is a blast.A procedurally generated endless mode would have justified the price for sure. I'd wait until it's half price in a sale if you can.My first playthrough took 3 and a half hours. The game is a speedrunners dream so the lack of leaderboards is a bit of a headscratcher, though the devs have said that it's something they wanted in the game and might be patched in the future.Tells you a gamepad is recommended but I don't think there's any need for that splashscreen as it plays great on both pad and mouse and keyboard, I tried both and went with mouse and keyboard as it felt better to me and it's a lot easier to aim when throwing things."

It's very frustrating to die halfway through a room because of a small mistake only to have to start over, games with instant kills can't punish death too much. To be clear I don't think the game is too hard, I think it's too repetitive, if there is one part to a room you haven't figured out yet you have to go through 30 seconds of gameplay you've already mastered just to get another shot at the actually difficult part only to die instantly and have to start over, many rooms are too long.

I beat the game in probably 4-5 hours. It wasn't too hard or too easy. But I will say this:If you're going to make an insanely long room without checkpoints and an immense amount of enemies and further increase the multi-tasking required to clear it with moving lasers, the least you could do is either clear up memory leaks or optimise the game so that it doesn't freeze as they shift into the room. My client even outright crashed halfway through the fight. The game is good, I'd reccomend it, but it still needs a little work.Also, add an option to turn off the auto-targeting for throwing items. The pink brawler guy isn't as much of a threat as the 2 dudes with shotguns lined up perfectly.The name is kind of lame too, but there's no changing that at this point.Overall good game, would reccomend. Roughly 5 hours playtime depending how much you die. Worth probably about 5-10$. Not 15."

You’re not a monk.”The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

,Not Recommended,489140,31181906,Posted: 16 April,all,standingonbees,"I really want to like this game. Teleportation is totally my superpower I would pick to have. The premise is awesome. The opening seen of X-Men with Nightcrawler is one of my favorites. This game should have been on my list of favorites...Unfortunately, there are a couple of serious gameplay problems that ruin it for me.1. You die in one hit. You can play perfectly for minutes doing masterfully with jumps and teleports and punches and throwing things, and then one random bullet from off the screen and it's a total do over. This is somewhat offset by a bullet time mechanic that builds via meter, but it's automatically activated, and it often goes off at totally useless times, making it very random and unhelpful most of the time. It would be so much better if this mechanic was manually operated, and I could turn on slow motion mode when I needed it.2. It's very repetitive. You can punch, and you can teleport, and throw random objects. There's no powerups, no new skills, no variation on the basic punch attack. The enemies are slightly different variations on each other, so you run around punching guys, and then go to another room to punch guys, then another room to punch guys. There's a few variations to the rooms (like turrets) but for the most part after you've played it for 10 minutes, you know what the rest of the game is going to be like (at least as far as I could stand it). If you like mashing the same button with no variation except the amount of frustration you feel caused by #1, then this is your game.It feels more like a demo than a complete game. More variation on the attacks, more unique weapons (the trident was awesome), being able to manually control your own super powers instead of it being poorly automatically activated by the game, enemies that actually require some skill and not just mash buttons, etc. It's very sparse, which is a shame, because the premise and the little execution it offers is so good. Too bad, so sad."

The fast paced but smooth gameplay introduced by the best teleport mechanic ever used in a video game is most enjoyable to play while relaxed but attentive to the difficult levels you will face. What makes this game so great, much like Hotline Miami, is that it uses very few buttons to control it, and this is where controller really becomes the best way to play. Repeated pressing of a single button doesn't work as well on a keyboard, but the ability to just tap it without moving your thumb will really come in handy as you teleport in and out of the various rooms throughout the level. This game is incredibly fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun game, especially if they enjoyed Hotline Miami."

However the story is very, very weak with an uninteresting ending. You don't have so many different gamestyles in this game. Music is just alright - more different tracks would have improved the atmosphere. If there will be a second game (which i hope so), it would be really wise to think about which elements are in a great story avaible.  This game or franchise could definitely become very amazing. Right now it's just good-great, but not more.Pro:- gameplay feels very smooth and makes a lot of fun- a lot of different enemies- interesting levels- graphic is great for a game like this- interesting idea how enemies or areas later spawnNegative:- story very weak (please, improve this for the next game.

You don't need to make a 'mind♥♥♥♥' just like in a typical David Fincher- (Fight Club; Se7en) or Christopher/Jonathan Nolan (Memento, Inception, ...)-movie or tv-show (PoI,Westworld etc)... but a bit more effort than what was delivered here- endfight is very short and uninteresting (i won't spoiler why)- amount of different powers low- amount of different weapons very low- soundtrack/music could need some more different melodies (f.e. just look at how different Hotline Miami is)"

The story was quite good beware spoilers hereI found confronting Stone a tad disappointing due to the fact there was no real fight and it was just punching him out of a window, although that was rather fun to do. I would definitely recommend you buy this game as it is a pleasure to play. I really hope the devs add a workshop so that poepl can upload maps that would widely expand Mr Shifty's horizons.Some parts can be frustrating at times where you have to constantly redo parts of a level but you soon get better and learn how do it. One of the thing I love most about it is the variety of props you can use to defet enemies, you can even be a literal keyboard warrior (that takes the term PC master race to a whole different level).You can tell the devs put a lot of work into it because even on the day of release it had not a single bug. That is better than most ubisoft games since 90% of the new ones are glitchy messes (apart from watchdogs 2 that is amazing). Another great aspect of the game is the script, the lines are fantastic they ae witty and inteligent, apart from nyx's Stone puns they are horrific. It would have been nice if the characters were voiced as it is sometimes difficult to read what someone is saying while you are bashing someone in the head with a mug.The game itself is amazing and anyone who likes hotline miami or games similar to that will love this. It also has a modest price for such a rush of a game. I really hope the devs add a workshop because that would be fantastic. Overall I would give it an 8 out of ten for being enjoyable yet frustrating at times and If i was to find any critique it would be that the boss battle wasn't really a battle and that it could do with a bit more content."

The easiest comparison I can make gameplay wise is Hotline Miami, but make no mistake, this is not a clone by any means. My first run took me roughly 4-5 hours to complete and was for the most part a blast.The extremely fast paced and lethal combat is the focus in this game and it's the best part about it. The world is very volatile and pretty much everything that can kill you can be used or manipulated to kill an enemy (the friendly fire is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious). Outside of straight combat there are a few pseudo platformer/puzzle sections where you need to use your shift to navigate a deadly environment.This is a pretty challenging game and you die in one hit no matter what so approach with caution if you're not okay with retrying sections 10-20+ times.Presentation wise this game is quite pleasing visually, the environments fall apart and explode all over the place as the fights unfold. The sound effects get the job done and suit the game but the music, although good, could've used a bit more in terms of variety.Well worth a look!"

You are the titular Mr Shifty, a teleporting thief who can blink around in a similar fashion to Nightcrawler from the X-Men. The controls are very simple, very tight, and make you feel like an unstoppable badass. Once you get your head wrapped around the controls, you'll scoff at a room full of armed goons, thinking ""Piece of cake."" This does not mean that the game is easy, however. The level design is clever. The difficulty ramps up at a satisfying pace, and occasionally forces you to think a bit outside of the box. The environments are highly destructible. You'll often find yourself coming out of a frantic flurry of action with a very satisfying mess left of the level you started on. The art is simple and stylish, with sort of a comic book quality to it. The game has a sense of humor about itself as well, with a lot of little tongue-in-cheek lines that poke fun at the genre.

I played it with keyboard and mouse, while the game says it's best played with a controller, so I will chalk up the occasional mistakenly teleporting in the wrong direction to that.  Despite that happening every once in a while, I found the game to be very playable with a mouse and keyboard.The core mechanic of teleporting around is very fun, smooth, and makes you feel like a badass.  You're limited to five rapid-fire teleports, but they usually regenerate pretty quickly.  If you burn through them all, though, it takes longer for them to regenerate.  You also get a short slow-mo ability that builds up as you attack.  Once it's full, getting nearly shot triggers it - sort of a ""get out of jail free"" card.Despite all the pluses, the store page mentions some things that are exaggerations:1. Shift through walls, through bullets, cover huge distances and be everywhere at onceYou can definitely shift through walls.  Shifting through bullets takes...a lot of practice, but is possible.  Covering huge distances?  Not really.  You're limited to a short range with each shift, so to cover ""huge"" distances, you'd have to chain a lot of shifts rapid-fire, and you're limited to five.  Be everywhere at once?  Nope.  Not even close.2. Use distraction, trickery, explore what's possible when stealth and action become one!You *can* distract and trick enemies to some degree, and you can make clever use of your environment to kill enemies in creative ways.  Stealth, though, is next to impossible.  Most rooms are locked until all enemies are dead, so you can't truly stealth your way through this game.  Sometimes, the act of shifting destroys things that enemies hear, so sneaking through rooms can either be easy, difficult, or impossible.  There are no stealth takedowns in the game.3. Toy with enemies, laugh as they use doors to enter roomsIf you take the time to stand there and laugh at enemies as they use doors to enter rooms, they're probably going to kill you.4. Underestimate enemies, and cry as they use group tactics to outsmart ShiftyGroup tactics?  Really?  Is that what it's called when they surround you and all fire at once?  Really, that's all they've got.  The AI is dumb.  They show no regard for their compatriots' lives and will fire or throw grenades at you even if you're surrounded by a bunch of their buddies.  You teleport away and then their buddies die for nothing.  They do not ever see or run from explosives.  They do not fire from cover.  They do come with different abilities, but use their abilities exactly the same regardless of whether they're alone or in a group.Anyway, despite those flaws, the game is very enjoyable.  Definitely worth the $15 price tag."

It has a nice comic book-esque art style and the music is fine albeit disappointing compared to what Hotline Miami had to offer. Roughly 5 hours long with a degree of replay-ability (should you want to get through a level flawlessly or with a faster time).

It all revolves around what happens when you can teleport all over the place and your fists are high impact lethal weopons. There is nothing not cool about that statement.This game awards experimentation and quick thinking, all while you can send your enemies flying through all the priceless furniture conveniently owned by the most evil♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the planet. Or just send em out the nearest window in a spectacular fashion. All while dodging bullets by thinking fast and punching everything else.This is a skill game at its finest. I never really enjoyed hotline miami much as it felt like hugging walls was all you can do. This game takes what makes hotline miami cool (one hit kills you and everything is so darn destructive) and mixes it with an ability that allows you to look cool AND feel cool while doing it.And to top it all off. It NEVER gets old to just kick♥♥♥♥♥while trashing the place at the same time."

The smooth as silk movement and intuitive design allows you to truely feel like a teleporting badass right from the get-go.It is fairly short, but I loved every second of it marring a couple of very difficult sections.This game is a must-buy."

The only downside I can find is that it hasn't any new game + or difficulty setting to amp up the experience. You can actually try to finish each stage without dying once, but good luck with that! The later stages are a ♥♥♥♥in' nightmare :) Anyway I hope they'll update it with some new modes or stuff, plus it has great potential for a sequel! If you like action games get it without thinking twice!"

76561198101143616,Recommended,489140,32083264,Posted: 31 May,all,Duff,"A fast-paced action puzzler in the vein of hotline miami.  Levels are over quickly enough so you can use it to unwind in breaks or when you've only a bit of time at the end of the day.  The levels I liked most were those where you could strategise and out-think the enemy.  I was happy to die many times, just to get things completed the way I wanted to (i.e. bait em in & blow em up).  A few sub-levels were a bit frustrating as they relied on getting long sequences of precise timing right.  Overall, well worth getting."

PLS HELP!(still reccomend this game from the beta)"
,Recommended,489140,34095171,Posted: 7 August,all,CoconutDragon,"This is one of the best games I've played in a while! One of those heart-pounding action games that really tests your skill - I loved it! Over the course of 18 levels they changed up the mechanics and introduced new things in often enough that it was never boring. It was a difficult game to perfect but not to the point of rage quitting. The writing had some great humour and overall it was a phenomenal, light-hearted game. Would recommend whole-heartedly!!"

The replay value is minimal, probably get all achievements and master every stage with three runs or less, unless your a hardcore speed runner, you can complete this game in under an hour in the first try.I'd say, if it ever goes on sale for £6.99 - It's a must get for what it makes you feel when slow-mo happens."

,Recommended,489140,34611603,Posted: 30 August,all,iarest,"I can't recomend this game in an absolutely manner... The game is fine, do not get me wrong... But, for me, the last level is a mess and you feel that you are playing randomly, hoping that the next time you will be lucky. Despite that I have played the last level twice (the game crashed before the boss...) and I knew the second time the strategy to follow, there was a random factor on the enemies that made me got tired and wishing to finish this f**** game. I was enjoying so much the game until the last level came.Is it a bad game? No, but it isn't a good one, because an arcade game like this one, must be well balanced and feeling that you can anticipate each move of the enemies (that's why is an arcade game and not another type). Just you can observe the heavy machine gunners on the last part of the final level, they tend to be agruped when the room changes and you will be so lucky if no of their bullets impact on you... That would be not so bad if you would have the chance to continue on that point, but no way... Repeat and repeat and repeat the first room wishing the best :)"

Joy, that may sound sarcastic so try to imagine Stimpy from Ren & Stimpy saying it.  I really loved the game & could not flaw it, I really enjoyed every part of it.  If Team Shifty made a sequel I would be really happy even if it was pretty much more of the same.  While I have played many great games this year, big budget & low budget, big worlds & small ones it is the first game this year I am giving the score of 5 out of 5http://littlemonkeygamereviews.blogspot.ie/2017/09/mr-shifty-review.html"
