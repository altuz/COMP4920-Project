Because this is just a simple port of a phone app game, right down to the horrible, unintuitive interface that was clearly meant for clicking and dragging using your finger.  Just an awful, greedy transition to the PC by the developers hoping to cash in on a different platform.  Oh and btw, you can get this game for FREE in the app store on your phone....yeah.  Save yourself the $5 bucks.  Seriously.  Its EXACTLY the same game as on the phone."

If you are looking for in-depth tactical/strategic space battles with content and mind-blowing ship to ship action...this is not the game for you.Lacking some content from the mobile ported game. ( Fewer by 5 ships available for use). ""Titan Ship Class"" as a PAID DLC, as opposed to being ""free(grind to get for free)"" on the mobile game.Controls are non-optimized for PC, just a straight up port and whatever the hell as long devs make money.For a game released on mobile and now in pc, the english makes me wanna slap myself. Plus a lot of ########## in some scenarios(unfinished texts). Lots of the game hints don't make sense( I think this is due to being translated from a different language to English)On the plus side, it's a game where you don't need to use any brains. at all. Relaxing to play a few battles now and then, and just enjoy the gfx and ships exploding, although not for free, unlike mobile ersion).Play the mobile version, you can get free ""gold"" and ""khorium(2nd currency)"" every few minutes by just force watching ads.If you are looking for an intense ship-to-ship dakka dakka game, you are better off playing Battlefleet Gothic: Armada."

Played the free version on android and enjoyed it, so when I saw there was a pc version I was very interested. Basically you are paying for a cut down version where after paying hard cash to play, I have to pay £1.60 for a ship that is free on the android game. There are also 2 further ships that are not even available, no doubt I will by them soon.If I buy a game, I expect the whole game. I'm for DLC, but it should be extra stuff that was not available when released, NOT the have to pay extra for bits you've intentionallly left out."

In a PC game ? In 2016 ?), which includes the impossibility of selecting a ship if 2 ships are on top of each other.Grindy, like the bad sort. After a while you need the second currency to get good weapons in a large enough quantity, or to grind missions, over, and over, and over, and over for some meager gain. You need the primary currency to buy a ship (60 / 100 k for the large ones, that you need to finish the game in 4 exemplary) and once you've got them, you need to unlock ""slots"" on them for values from 6k to about 45k each. Note, you gain 4k for a lvl 44 mission (2/3 in the game). Baiscally for a fully fitted warship, you need to redo that mission what... 80 times ?Timers to repair... ok, this is dumb. Not a phone game.Paid DLC something like a few weeks after release.Localization... ok no one cares for the story but not only it does not make sense, but also words are plain wrong sometimes, if not missing entirely."

76561198307409373,Recommended,489170,29559728,Posted: 29 January,all,trader_mickk,"As has been said in a few other reviews, an obvious port direct from mobile phone. That being said, it is much easier for this old bloke to play on PC, mostly because PC screen is much easier to see :PGood graphics, sound and it plays almost exactly like it shows in the clips and pictures.Keep in mind that it *will* get very grindy during the game, saving up to unlock slots on ships, not to mention getting new ships themselves can take some time, of course you CAN throw money at the game to do this, but you don't NEED to.At this point in time I am fairly certain that it can be completed without spending any real money, even if I have not gotten that far, there are a LOT of levels, 60+ and still counting so far.TIP: Missile/Strategic weapons all have a limited amount of shots, Laser and Kinetic weapons don't, so make sure to mix them up on your ships.TIP: Check your weapon ranges. A good setup is to have long range missiles along with middle and close weapons. Those missles will fire off almost right at the start of a battle.TIP: Once the *really* powerful Lasers/Kinetic weapons become available, you don't need to have the strategic weapons anymore, so switch them out for one of those."

It's an indie game so dont whine too much. Its not bad.Having said that. It is a a game ported from a mobile game sothere is bound to be issues.ProsIts exactly like the mobile game as in it is exacctly liket he mobile games minus the dlc. in the mobile game the dlc are something you have to buy kromium to get. Here at least you just have to buy the the dlc and you get the titans.Its for casual gamers. Dont think of spending hundred sof hours into it. Seriously its just a casual gaming game. If you want to grind by all means but its better playing it, stopping doing other things then when you feel like it go back to it.ConsIts exctly like the mobile game. I mean come on at least change it up a bit its suppose to be in the computer. Try out better graphics or having more ship not just use the exact same game and just port it to the pc.THe fact you have to grind like hell just to get things. Like seriously no to grind, a little  bit is okay but to spend mroe than a few minutes just to afford a new shp or a new weapon thats given at random is freaking insane.Having said that have fun and give it a try"

I have spent a bit of time playing it while playing other games, until I found that it only saves games locally.  I was on a trip I found that I needed to start over is when I decided to quit.

The game have two currencies, a primary and secondary currency. The main currency is gold, gold is the ingame standard currency you can purchase new ships and items with. The secondary currency is Khorium, this is the real money currency, this currency seems to have no role in the PC version though you are collection it through emissions..So way two currencies, well first i played this game on my phone and in the phone version you can purchase ships and items for khorium as well gold. You can still collect Khorium playing the game and watching advertisement or buy lots of it for a not too pricey price.So yes there is two version of the game.Personally i say Galaxy Reavers is more suited for an mobile or tablet then the pc because the resolution and the GUI scale. But the game is much, much cheaper here on steam.Purchaings the game on steam with DLCs is like purhcaings the ingame items on the mobile or tablet version but sheaper.I like this game, it's fun to play and have good atmosphere around is. But at the current stage of the game i can't say i canrecomend this game, especialy if you have more copies if the game. ;)"

Ships seem to go were thay want to even though you tell them to go anthor direction. The tutorial is shoved down your throat and dosnt tell you what to do. You cant even change the settings befor you finish the tutorial. And it needs a better way to keep track of your ships.You get 4 ships at a time in battle if one of your ships moves out of view you have to move the screen to the ship away that went astray have it move back to the other ships you were keeping track of. And as far as I can tell the game only uses the mouse for controling your ships. there was no key binding cart in the settings menu so if there is any I dont' know.But the game is farly ease to control. I just wish I could hit a number key to salect one of the four ships in my fleet insted of clicking on them one at a time. But you get what you pay for,and for 5 bucks it's not bad."

So when I found out it was on STEAM with DLC all in 1 bundle, I went n to buy it right away. Then for some reason it would not launch and it was nothing related to security apps.

But the DLC I paid for did not get added to the game when I finished the tutorial stages. :l"

You can delete all traces of the game from your HDD AND the steam cloud but your progress is still saved elsewhere.

Destroy these ships. You win.""Overall, it's not the kind of game you can play for 10 hours straight. Maybe a couple of minutes at a time.
