,Recommended,489260,29815322,Posted: 9 February,all,Dominator841,"MMMMM, I missed you ASCIIFirst let me start out by saying this game is rogue-like,why there is no tag? who knows(There's a tag now).This is a game that takes inspiration from old ASCII dungeon-crawlers. There's crafting (things such as potions, weapons, talismans), enchanting of weapons, local and internet co-op, a wide variety of baddies to square up against.Now for the actual review:This game was built around the controller, playing it with M&Kb is almost impossible (it just feels weird), the core gameplay is excellent. Fighting never gets stale especially with elemental enemies thrown into the mix, though most times you can only hit one enemy at a time and sometime's you can hit multiple.By far the wizard is my favorite class, a battlemage with a staff for casting the one spell you have which is good for keeping distance between you and an enemy, and any weapon you want to wield (Pike is best).Blocking system is (alright) blocking an attack still deals damage but less than if you had not blocked at all. There is a parry system (no not dark souls parry), when the enemies attack is about to land press the guard button and you will take no damage and you may strike while the enemy is in recovery.All classes have a form of ranged attack, other than the wizard and the warrior, the ranger and amazon can throw their shields at enemies. The warrior being a tank and heavy hitter slower than the rest of the classes and the wizard, able to cast a spell.Pros:-Gore-Easy and comftorable controls (for gamepad)-Gauntlet like feel-High replayability-Leaderboards-Can play with friends-Lots of baddies to kill-Lots of loot to be had-Still better than NMSCons:-Rooms could be a little larger (and more random)-The ability to remap controls for the gamepad is non existant-Could use more variety in weaponsVerdict:Brut@l receives an 8.5/10"

To build weapons you must find letters, but letters are not used upin the process presenting a player with no opertunity cost in doing so.  Potions are randomized each run, however there are only 8 kinds of potions avalible.  ""Secret rooms"" are just rooms locked by an element that have to be broken into with a weapon upgraded with that element.  These elemental upgrades come from letters colored acording to the element they are representing and each weapon needs a paticular letter to be upgraded.  These letters are found everywhere and in furniture randomly.  Furniture will provide 1xp per piece broken, and quickly becomes a necessary chore.  There are about 20 skills that can be seen from the begining and every charicter comes with a few unlocked.  One skill point is gained per level and the skills are simple.  To get an extra life, you must gamble loot, which is useless for anything else (score maybe?).  There are elite monsters that have a element attached to them and that is the only aparent enhancement.  There is a boss at the end of the game, not sure about anywhere else, i got bored about 7 levels in (out of 26!?) and did not finish, which brings me to my last point.Brut@l isPainfuly Easyfor experienced rougelike players.  Dodging is directional with one button and can be done constantly and can interupt the enemy.  Many enemys and especially traps deal little damage.  Hunger and health are dealt with through eating.  Power attacks (mostly jumping and landing) hit many targets and end just about any fight, yet recharge rapidly.Overall, this game may actualy be close to the original rouge (I have never played rouge) than many other rougelikes out there, but those games are much more fun and rewarding.5/10, for visuals and polish, and it could be enjoyed casualy.  Refunded."

There is nothing remotely proper-roguelike about it."
76561197974280669,Not Recommended,489260,30113680,Posted: 22 February,all,Chris Dragon,"So although I am actually enjoying this game as a time waster, there are too many design decisions that make me say do not buy.  The first issue is the obvious, the controlling scheme.  The character feels 'floaty' and is too unresponsive at the best of time, meaning that most falls will be to the game over-steering and not to any actual skill and thus not the players' faultSecondly, the lackluster combat.  The fact that's a simple three hit combo is fine, the button presses are reasonably responsive, but the targeting is sloppy and in a game like this that means most of the combat deaths are not going to be the players' fault.Thirdly, the risk-reward factor.  The further you go down, the slower the progression becomes and for some reason, someone thought it would be a fun idea to slowly reduce the amount of loot you get per floor.  The excuse of it's supposed to ramp up the difficulty is a bad one because to go further down into a murder hole like this the rewards have to be worth going down there in the first place.Now, before anyone whines about how this is supposed to be replicating Rogue or Moria or any of the other random number generators of that era, I'm going to repeat what I just said, Rogue and the others in that genre are not games based on skill, they're purely based on luck and meticulous tedium requiring you to test every wall, and hope to whatever greater power (including Science) that the next room doesn't have a creature you can't handle, or that every tag you do is a hit.  No skill involved.  And anyone who has played those game has a story of how their high level X was taken down by a rat because they kept missing, and it kept hitting, solely by the random luck of the 'dice'.Final Verdict:  No."

Feels a bit like the Hand of Fate combat in a Tron Fantasy world.My 1 whine so far, I would far prefer a leaderboard that recorded my best run in the game rather than just my career kills between all runs."

,Recommended,489260,29935976,Posted: 14 February,all,America Has A Problem #LasVegas,"This will become a cult classic for ARPG/Roguelite fansThe Good-- ASCII aesthetic extremely reminiscent of the warez and .nf0 days of early internet piracy and cracking-- Near-fully destructible environments (destroying environmental items gives experience and has the potential to drop phat lewts)-- Lock system that requires weapon enchants to open doors. A new twist on an old mechanic (door keys)-- Interesting and varied weapon selection-- Simplistic yet effective weapon enchantment system that offers high reward for your checking-every-corner-for-hidden-loot addiction-- 26 campaign levels that get increasingly difficult and progressively longer as you traverse the world of Brut@l-- When campaign isn't enough, you've got community levels and the ability to make your own dungeons with the ingame dungeon editor-- Custom edit your own hero as well-- Lots of interesting mobs; the game has a very eclectic bestiary (anything from small carnivorous rollie-pollies to flying reaper gargoyles on fire with pools of acid dripping from their feet).-- The mobs offer a very interesting difficulty mechanic called 'Squads' in which mob placement ala Dark Souls ensures that you practice appropriate focus fire and strategies to maximize success (ie. going after archers who are equipped with flame arrows as opposed to facetanking an armored destroyer). The game ensures this by forcing multiple mobs into designated squads in later levels, creating what originally used to be 1v1 mob fights into 6v1 mob fights, etc. Can get hectic really quick.-- Addictive replayability. Very hard to put down!-- Couch Co-OpThe Bad-- Very limited appearance customization.-- Very limited armor selection. Literally only 4 pieces of armor to get throughout the entire game, each armor adds +25 total armor to a bar that has a maximum of 100. Every -25 armor (something like 25 enemy attacks) lost disintegrates that armor item and you must reloot another to regain the armor bonus.-- Dungeon rooms can feel claustrophobic. While the dungeons in their entirety are quite expansive, especially as the levels progress, the rooms themselves can sometimes be incredibly small and repetitive.-- The aesthetic, while being a major selling point, can also conversely be a negative if you're a fan of variety. There's not much diversity in Brut@l's environment; the various oranges, greens, blues, purples, reds and yellows that dot the dungeonscape with lava pools, nature enchants, or scent trees that provide healing fruit are the only visual tangents you'll get when exploring the consistent black and white pallete of Brut@l's world.-- Purposeful input lag. This is one of my biggest issues with the game. A mouse and keyboard makes input lag extremely noticeable and makes your character feel bloated, like driving a car with crappy suspension. When your character turns, it feels like trying to steer a small boat. However, my PS4 controller has eliminated the feel of the input lag almost entirely; this game was definitely designed with consoles in mind.-- Hunger system. Not really all that bad, just feels forced and unnecessary in a game like Brut@l. Sometimes you'll find yourself getting hunger even when you have full HP. Normally, you may have enough potions of vitality to heal yourself. But in earlier levels, especially on squisher classes and for less experienced players, you may need all your food mainly as healing items. Being forced to use them for sating hunger just feels like a waste and also makes your recovery options more limited.The Ugly-- No Online Co-Op >:("
,Not Recommended,489260,29859048,Posted: 11 February,all,WIZARD OF RAP,"Pretty standard Binding of Isaac style game. I refunded it because of some design decisions that annoyed me, and also because there's nothing it does that I can't find done better in other games.It's supposed to be a love letter to old Roguelikes but it doesn't do anything to emulate them other than having unidentified potions, permadeath and the floor texture you see in the screenshots.Doesn't seem to have a real understanding of what makes engaging gameplay, a lot of your playtime is spent walking through simple mazes devoid of enemies or tediously smashing every environment object because half of the loot is hidden in them. The loot isn't even exciting, armor gives a percentage reduction to damage taken, weapons have higher damage numbers or elemental properties, money can be spent on maybe getting an extra life.Combat is so simple that you don't need anything but your fists and occasionally your torch. The only dangers you'll face are bottomless pits and platforming segments, which are frustrating because a missed jump is instant death and means you restart your entire run from the beginning.The ASCII gimmick is poorly handled and completely misses what made ASCII art in old games so charming. It's all standard 3d models or 2d (non-ASCII) drawings with random characters sprinkled over them.I wouldn't even particularly recommend it on sale, it's probably fun to co-op but there are better choices out there for that."
,Not Recommended,489260,29810829,Posted: 9 February,all,Mushuukyou,"This is a fun game at first, but I have to change my review.It's very.. shallow. I like how you tried to do a roguelike, but it falls short. It's without a full inventory system. No cursed items. Why can't I find magical armor, amulets, etc? Where is the depth?Sorry, but, if you're going to do a roguelike like Angband, then do it. Don't half♥♥♥♥♥it."
76561197970435474,Recommended,489260,33407057,Posted: 9 July,all,Vargas78,I quite like it. I recommend it if you like Gauntlet and rogue-like/roguelite type games which this pays tribute to though in gameplay its very much an action game with a few rpgs elements like leveling up and crafting. The combat is generally good and fun. Worth a shot on a promotion.

This is the third review I rewrote: after 9 hours of play I've to say:It really enjoyed me, but there are some parts of the game that should be fixed in my opinion.-For example, except the Ice enchantement for weapons which freeze enemies, which should be the advantages of using other elements?I maybe should explain myself better...Why I should use a specific weapon enchantement against a specific type of enemies?What's the FIRE effect compared to POISON effect?What about ELECTRIC and ARCANE weapon attribute(this last one I really don't know what the pickle does)?-I don't know if there are other options to use money, but at moment the only use I could meet in game is to offer a part of our gained gold to the gods, if you will offer money enough, you will gain a EXTRA LIFE.It, at the moment, seems the only advantage the money can provide.-The local coop is a few umbalanced I retain: I started a local coop with a friend... the hardest thing which create us problems in coop, is food!-In Brut@l there are 26 levels, we just was starving in the Third floor because there wasn't food enough.-If you fall from a platform while jumping, you'll lose if you hadn't any extra life, maybe should be better respawn the player with a very low amount of life for penality than kill the player instantly...-There are some corridors which will inflict POISON or FIRE damage... ok, nice... but I lived an ugly experience:When you have only 10hp(so you're about to die) and the POISON or the FIRE corridor is the only way to arrive to the end of level.-Local coop... I was hoping in a multy' in local Split Screen so 2 player can also decide to explore 2 different room at the same time... It could be awesome instead of playing in the same dungeon's room and walking togheter by forcing the player don't leave the other player.-There's no online coop at moment.My tip?Wait before buying it, It's a good game, It just needs to be fixed.I hope the developers will update it with new content and variety.Good work."

,Recommended,489260,30600906,Posted: 18 March,all,A. Sedai,"I like this game alot. The atmosphere really does remind me of the old ASCII Rogue games brought to life.It does have a hunger mechanic, which I normally hate, but somehow they've managed to transform what is usually a nuisance into a relentless push. And when you get down to your last turkey leg and you're hurtin', breaking open things to find more food becomes your primary goal.As other people have mentioned, not having volume control feels lacking. As good as this game is, you're still able to watch YouTube while you're playing it, but the music sometimes gets in the way of watching videos.So, if you're in the mood to kill things, but planning for world domination feels like too much work, this is the game for you."

The ASCII style is great and the game feels very slick and polished. There are so many rogue-like titles out there but I think this one will stand out.You have to discover crafting recipes and potion ingredients as you explore, while you have to take risks with the latter as you don't know what effect they'll have on you.There's definitely enough to keep you playing for a long time, plus the dramatic soundtrack will permanently keep you on edge!Pros:- Great art style- Smooth visuals and gameplay- Solid crafting system- Dramatic soundtrackCons:- Very hard to play with keyboard and mouse- You lose all progress if you die"

The combat can be a bit basic, but if you like old-school brawlers it's enjoyable to mash some skulls.
