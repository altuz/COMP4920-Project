,Not Recommended,489360,24737026,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,ArthurPlays,"I waited about a year for this game to be released. After following the game through their website I noticed that the game had a Steam page that I could follow and wishlist. I've waited so long for a great free-roam style FNAF game and I was really hoping that I finally got my wish.Unfortunetely, this game has way too many problems to cost what it does (as of today, 8/6/16, it is 10$). Not only was I able to be killed through walls, but the game actually has a moment of pure filler by making the player hide for 10 minutes of real-life time! Are you kidding me?! I believe the devs were smart about this and because of all the filler the game contains, it's actually hard to beat the game under the 2-hour limit to refund it.After beating the game I actually had to collect myself. The story of the game is nearly non-existant and doesn't really keep me wanting to play at all. During most moments, if you died, you had to replay a lot of audio calls and hear the same lines over and over because you died. Not only this, but the game is very unforgiving. If you mess up even by a single frame, you're dead.The game held a lot of promise it also looks and sounds fantastic. However, it is way too lacking in any actual gameplay or story elements to keep me playing. I have beaten the game, but at the cost of my sanity.PRO'S:*Great atmosphere*Mildy entertaining voice acting*Amazing graphics*A good scare at the startCON'S:*Has way too many bugs*No mouse-lock at some points (caused me to die)*Can get killed through walls*Not enough hiding spots*The cat can see you through walls at points*Little to no story*Some text is still Russian (even when set to English)*Cheap filler mini-games*Bad jumpscare animation(The list could go on)I had a horrible time with the game and just wanted to beat it so my audience didn't have to play. The ending is nearly non-existant and just sort of... ends?I really wanted to like the game, but it's just too broken currently.Here is some gameplay from my YouTube Channel, KnightGamerRex:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T7jOi2UsHc"

,Recommended,489360,33594385,Posted: 16 July,all,MrCreativeCat,"Despite having many resemblances to the Five Nights at Freddy's series in both the atmosphere and easter eggs, Case: Animatronics takes the animatronic horror and suspense to a whole new level. It is a free-roam game where you are stalked by a wolf, cat, and owl, and your goal is to complete the tasks given to you by finding secrets hidden throughout the game. There are many unexpected jumpscares, and the whole environment of the game is quite horrifying. There are a few downsides to this game, however. First, you get very little direction in the game, so it takes a long time to figure certain things out without toutorials.Second, there is little replay value once you complete the game and collect all the notes. Also, be sure to have a backup if you wish to replay the game after finishing it. Your save file is completely erased once you're done. Overall, despite these negatives, I would still recommend the game to anyone who enjoys a good scare."
,Not Recommended,489360,25001183,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,PyPaw,"-TL;DR-Pros:1) Free Roam2) Excellent Models/textures3) Updates regularlyCons:1) Glitchy Animatronics2) Broken Puzzles3) No Form of Objective List4) No Real Ending5)♥♥♥♥♥♥Voice Acting6) 10 dollar tag for a 5 dollar game-Long Version-So, the one thing this game did right was the free roam style that brings the world to life. The idea that you're not glued to a chair and waiting for the evil robots to eat you is amazing. Now you can run at them instead! The world you play in and the animatronics are really well modeled as well.That said, the issues with this game completely destroy the positive. Some of them have been patched, but others remain. A nitpick first.. The voice acting is terrible. The monotoned main character and the weird way the phone guy talks just makes everything laughable instead of scary, which completely ruins the mood. A more serious issue is that the animatronics can appear out of nowhere or glitch through walls to kill you. This issue alone makes the games ""Hardcore"" mode impossible. Some of the games puzzles also seen to be buggy. An example, at one point of the game the heating is getting too high and you need to turn it off before it kills you. Instead of punching in the code to turn it off, you can just sit around for 10 minutes and it will skip over to the next part of the game.That leads into my next issue with there being no form of objective system. You wouldn't even know you can find a code to complete this task because the game never tells you there is! I found it by chance after being chased into a room and hiding.. AFTER already completing that part of the game. You'll often find yourself circling the building until you find the goal by mistake. There are 'green' spots on the map at times, but there is never a clear reason why it's green or why you need to go there. The final issue, which may not be an issue to some, is that you will work all the way to the end of this game for a fade out. Sorry if that's a spoiler, but that's all you'll get. There is no real end to this story so it feels like you just wasted your time.Overall, this game doesn't seem like it was finished and isn't worth the 10 dollar price tag. It's asking more that the normal Fnaf games while giving you less. It seems to be getting patched up with time, but this wasn't an early access game. You pay full price for a 'finished' game so you should GET a finished game. Wait a bit before buying if you really want it, otherwise just skip this game and play Joy of Creation. It offers more than this game and it's FREE."

Here is a list of the what I find to be Pros and Cons in the game.Pros!The detail in this game is very nice.  The small details in the world make it fun to look at it and explore.The animotronics in the game have good models and good details in them.The scares in this game are pretty good, sadly though they do get a tad old after about a hour or two of gameplay.Cons!There is some optimization issues in places of the game.  So exspect some frame rate loss in areas.I found it very hard to get the jist of the story because it is told through notes you find throughout the game, but with how persistant the animatronics are it is hard to search for the notes.The voice acting could be better but it is a hole lot better than it was on release.Over all this game is not to bad,  but there is definatly room for improvment.  I have to give this game a 6.5\10 though I do recommend you give it a try it is still terrifying!"

The voice acting could be better, and makes me wish there was a Workshop where I might be able to make my own mods, but this game does the ""terror"" trick well.TL;DR - If you want something cheaper than a street burrito, that'll make you sh*t yourself twice as much; pick this game up and play it in a thunderstorm."

I typically don't play them as 1) I suck at them and 2) I generally get bored quickly.  However this was by far the most enjoyable one due to it's atmosphere, creepiness and animatronic AI.  I really liked how the animatronics could open doors or if they chased you to an area where you shut a door they wouldn't be like ""gee where did he go?"" they would actually open the door and still search for you.  Highly recommend picking this up if you enjoy survival horror games, being chased by animatronics or having the crap scared out of you."

The voice acting isn't as bad as I thought it would be, but the poor design choices, cheap assets, and bad text translation is enough to warrant a refund. I really wanted to like this game; I figured it would be just slightly cheesy and B-movieish and that is actually what I was looking for. I'm sure it actually would deliver on that if I could get past the flickering. I've played many, many, horror games (even lots with horrible reviews) and there are some that have flashlights go out, flicker, etc but never to this extent. I know it may seem like I'm harping on one issue, but it was the equivalent of a mosquito flying by my ear that I couldn't get rid of. Sorry, I really wanted to like it."

First off, what game gets released for an asking price of £6.29 (the amount the game was worth when I purchased it last year) without an actual ending? Note: I have yet to get to the ending because of the insane difficulty the game is constantly at, even in ""easy"" mode, I have relied on other people's reviews to find out that the game has no ending whatsoever, just a major cliffhanger. Second of all, the new voice acting has ruined the game for me and I hate how I cannot get a refund because I have played for more than 2 hours, because the game was still enjoyable at that point. I feel that the developers need to add a voice toggle option, so that you can choose which voice actor(s) you want to have in the game. Until these issues are dealt with, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Spend your money on a game that has good voice acting, balanced difficulty, and an actual ending!"

Gameplay and everything else is awesome its great really shows Fnaf in 3D free roam. like 8-BitRyan say:If you like dying a lot and aren't bothered about an ending, pick this game up. Otherwise, wait until the developer's seriously sort this experience out. This has potential to be the best FNAF inspired game ever.NOTE: This isn't a stab at the developers behind this game in the slightest. I appreciate the hard work a game like this takes to make. ALL of the issues I stated above could have been very easily solved had have this game released a few months later. Unfortunately, I just currently can not recommend this game in the state it's in.

The strategic element of deciding where to hide according to the patrol routes of the animatronics is a thrilling addition with respect to the original FNAF.On the downside, the game draws too heavily on existing superior games such as FNAF, TJOC:Reborn and Outlast, so the gaming experience won't feel fresh if you've played those games. It feels more like a polished fangame of FNAF, and is definitely overpriced at $10.I'd be surprised if this game doesn't get a copyright claim from FNAF.The voice acting of the main character is deficient, and the main story is again too closely tied to the theme of animatronics and a pizzeria from FNAF to be interesting on its own.The game can get unintentionally hard, as some of the animatronics can decide to camp outside of your hiding spot permanently (guaranteed death!) or can spot you even if they didn't really see you before hiding.Overall, it's an enjoyable game with decent entertaining value and some scares, which places it above many other horror games on Steam."

,Recommended,489360,24734053,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,FNIA Mangle,"Straight off the bat, this game is great. This is one of those game were the ambiance is spot on and makes you feel terrified at every corner. The walking animations for the Animatronics are perfect. I especially love how you can see them move while looking at them through the cameras. The Animatronics designs are amazing and terrifying. I love how there is voice acting for the player (Officer Bishop) and the man on the phone (Idk his name). A few things that dissapoint me are: The jumpscare animations aren't that good (But there still scary). When you beat the game, you just beat the game. That really dissapoints me 'cause I was hoping to learn some more about the backstory and find out who the man on the phone was. As some people have pointed out there are still quite a few bugs in the game. Some that I found are: Some times the Wolf will get stuck and can't move until I reach a check-point, The Animatronics won't kill me even if I'm right infront of him/her, The door will get stuck and I can't open it. This isn't a bug, but it really annoys me, sometimes the Flashlight won't stop flickering. Yes I do know the Flashlight is suposed to flicker, but what I mean is sometimes it just won't stop flickering so that makes it really hard to see sometimes. I can turn it off and on and that stops the constant flickering for a while but then it just starts again. Overall CASE: Animatronics is a great game, definitely worth the $10, although I got it while it's on sale. So I give it a 10/10 even though there are still a few bugs in it."

,Not Recommended,489360,26116351,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Railer666,"Please don't release a game that has no mouse look invert.That is a standard feature.Plus you can only remap 3 keys on the keyboard. What the hell, that just makes no sense. I paid for the game, let me set it up and play it with the control options I want. The developer could fix this easily in just a few minutes and make a quick update, at least for some of the problems anyway.Sorry but this game is not worth $9.99. It does not run smooth at all. Crashes often. I can't enjoy it because of those reasons, and of course the lack of control customization..!I bought it on sale and still refunded. Developers, Start with the basics. control customization for players.In the state that its in now , don't waste your money on it. If the developers fix the game I will update this review. I can't play the game as it is now. So I will not Recommend it..!As of Nov. 2nd  2016 the developer responded to my review, So he or she is aware of the problems with the game and has said they would work on them. Infact the developer responded to every negative review on steam. I'm looking forward to playing the fixed version of the game, but I suspect thats not going to happen."

The game has a matching game inside of it as a filler(what is that♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Completely not worth the buy. I cant say enough: ***DO NOT BUY THIS***)I WISH I COULD REFUND BUT I PLAYED IT FOR TOO DAMN LONGEDIT 2: I did get my refund and it was well worth it. If I could I would refund it again.I played this game for a bit now and I have tried to beat it but I cant seem to find any way to the second power panel. The game looks well made except for the voice acting. The voice acting could have been better.Also as I have stated before, It seems impossible to do BECAUSE the map gives hardly any indication to doorways or how to actually get into a certain area. I have been looking for a card or any way to advance in the game but it seems impossible to find a small blue card with no indication before you search it up or spend hours observing the ground.Also the jumpscares aren't even scary after the first 5. This game will also probably be polluted by ""hardcore fans"" who will defend this♥♥♥♥♥♥hole because its like ""Five nights at freddy's""."

I can't believe there isn't controller support on a recent game. Seriously? I have a dumb budget laptop that refuses to activate the mouse and the keyboard at the same time. People have told me that this is a ""hardware issue"" which is absolutely untrue. As long as I have a controller I can play RAM-hogging games like GTA V. However, with games that don't support controllers I'm stuck with having to STOP to look around. You know how dumb that is in a horror/scary game?*Runs away* oh have to turn left? *stops and waits a second for this to register*Gets freaking eaten by the monster instantly.EDIT: I have a budget laptop, much like most people do. It has Synaptics TouchPad which is a total nazi about not allowing your mouse move while you press a key. And guess what? Most people have Synpatics TouchPad! And guess what else? Most people have budget laptops! If you'd like to cater to the majority, secure them as consumers, then you should definitely provide controller support. I have no idea why the developers of this game didn't. Most of the ♥♥♥♥ing PC gamers I know USE CONTROLLERS!I can literally go and find 10-20 year old games that HAVE CONTROLLER SUPPORT! This is the first game I have come across in the 4 years I have been with steam. I have LITERALLY NEVER COME ACROSS A GAME THAT DOESN'T HAVE CONTROLLER SUPPORT! I have 10-20 year old games in my library! Therefore, what the ♥♥♥♥, developers? Sorry, but I cannot recommend a game if the developers don't even bother taking into account the majority of gamers who OWN BUDGET LAPTOPS WITH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥SYNAPTICS TOUCHPAD!"

The first code is easy to read, until you read the very last code.2. The grammar is honestly terrible, except for the guy on the phone.3. In the part where you have to find the code for the ventilation, it took me FOREVER to ♥♥♥♥ing find, I got to the point where I just had to look it up, and I found out that it's on the bottom right corner of the picture in the conference room, which is almost black, and it was written in mother ♥♥♥♥ing black.4.

Not only are the animatronics scary but they are also designed to kill you into your happy place and then remind you that you're in the real world and then repeat the process.
