76561198055691099,Not Recommended,489370,29834707,Posted: 10 February,all,-W3E- Josh,"EDIT: This Review has been updated following the Ebola Outbreak Update.I really want to like Quarantine. The idea of desperately trying to fend off the end of civilization is very appealing to me. However, the game suffers many problems, both thematic and mechanical. EDIT: Many of the mechanical problems have been improved with the Ebola Update. While the game is still somewhat shallow(3-4 hours of unique gameplay, maybe another 3-5 on top of that if you want to try out all the diseases.), it is a massive improvement over how it previously was(90 minutes of shallow gameplay). However, it is now out of early access with a slew of major problems remaining. I am uncertain if the devs will even bother to update it anymore.Thematic problems: This game has several mechanics and simply pieces of information that go against the narrative and logic.1. Time: The game takes place over the course of 15-30 days, with humanity either dying spontaneously(more on that later) or being saved in that time period. This, in short, makes absolutely no sense. The idea that a disease capable of quickly overwhelming the globe in a matter of weeks could also be cured in a week(see point 2) is preposterous. EDIT: This remains unchanged in the Ebola update.2. The cure: In Quarantine, the cure takes 4 scientists, 150,000$, and about a week. Yup, 150K. Any major company or even tiny nation could afford to cure the disease. Honestly, any middle class person could blow their retirement money and cure it. That's nonsensical. EDIT: This remains unchanged as of the Ebola update.3.  Life without the cure. It is totally possible to stop the disease without studying it at all. How? By cruely allowing all those in infected areas to die with strict quarantines? Nope. It turns out this humanity-destroying virus can be wiped from a city by a competent doctor working for a day. Yes, 1 doctor working for 1 day can purge a city as large as NYC(see below) in a day. Without a cure, without any money. EDIT: As of the Ebola update, while it is still POSSIBLE to do this, it is generally more effective to cure the disease.4. Cities. All cities function the exact same in Quarantine, regardless of size, which adds to a lack of depth(see next section). EDIT: This remains unchanged as of the Ebola Update.5. Fail state. You lose the game when a certain number of people are infected. This can lead to some ridiculous moments where you lose the game even though huge parts of the world remain uninfected. Unfortunately, this is at the core of the game's mechanics, and therefor is unlikely to change. EDIT: This remains unchanged as of the Ebola Update.Mechanics: All of the above, while they can take you out of the experience, aren't enough to make the game bad. This game fails for exactly 1 reason, it has no depth.1. Classes: The 4 classes are somehwat unbalanced and ridiculous in their flexibility. Every class can do everything, with each class getting a bonus to something. The worst is the scientist, which get more samples when they collect. The total number of samples you need is like 16 over the course of the game, so this bonus is very weak(EDIT: this remains unchanged as of the Ebola update). EDIT(as of the ebola update): The next is the diplomat, who saves money when building bases. This bonus is useful for the first quarter-to-half of the game, after which it  becomes completely redundant due to the cap on the number of bases you can have. Hiring them at the begining is a choice between extra money and effective treatment. Second to best, the security takes less damage if they get injured. EDIT: as of the Ebola Update, every class has more hp, and missions are less risky. Combine that with the bonus to curing being later, and while this class is still good, it isn't way better than every other anymore. Best is the medic, which have a bonus to the afformentioned easy curing of a city.EDIT: The tech to increase treatment amounts is now very hard to get, making the medic very useful throughout the game.2. Technology. Tech provides the vast majority of progress, outshining everything else. There are a total of 16 techs, total. EDIT: As of the Ebola update, the tech tree has been rearanged to make the best tech's harder to come by. As a result, deciding on tech is a very important decision that adds quite a bit of depth to the game.3. Research. You spend 12-16 samples and take 1-4 weeks depending on how much you spend. It's kind of shocking how a game about curing a super-plague has such a barebones cure system.EDIT: This remains more or less unchanged with the ebola update. Diseases can mutate to make it take marginally longer to cure, but in my expierence they rarely ever do that.4. Disease types. There are 5 as of version 1.0. The first, Virus, mutates(gains new traits) at a marginally higher rate(The speed of 2 snails instead of the speed of 1). The second, Bacteria, spreads between cities faster. The third, Prion, spreads fast within cities.The fourth Ebola, worsks just like viruses. The fifth, Fungus, works just like bacteria. Bacteria/Fungus is by far the hardest, because how much you can cure in a single city scales rapidly, while how many cities you can at one time barely scales at all.EDIT: As of the Ebola update, units now take time to move. This positioning adds difficulty and depth to the game.TLDR my overall thoughts: After the Ebola update, I was excited to watch the developement of this game. After all, the update improved many of the game's problems, but still kept the EA tag. This signalled to me that the game was going to be continually improved. However, the version 1.0 update barely did anything at all, and moved the game out of EA. It appears this game is done being developed. It still has about 3-5 hours of unique gameplay to it. If that and the unique premise is worth $10 to you, then feel free to pick it up. Otherwise, might be best to wait for a sale"
76561198004316343,Not Recommended,489370,33034896,Posted: 30 June,all,Mortifus7,"This is a pretty solid adaptation of the Pandemic game style. Simple, reasonably fun to play, but unfortunately also meanders after the third game. It quickly becomes a game of control nodes, rather than strategy, tactics without suprise. It has some great underlying concepts; the disease research centres, the unlocks, but it feels... bereft of further content. I want to like this game, I'd even be willing to go back and play it after a break, but it simply needs more complexity. Airborne strains/waterborne strains introduce new challenges to contain the contagion would be a simple thought. The virus mutates or somehow breaks containment- and now you have to react. World events are a fantastic addition to this game and could easily make this more modifier heavy. Or hell; two pathogens at once.Solid game; too simple to be distinguished among others of its kind- but it had/has the potential to be. Maybe wait for DLC/Updates. 6/10"
,Not Recommended,489370,29876981,Posted: 12 February,all,Bertie,"Many of the reviews here are saying that the game is too short, and whilst I can't disagree with that, I don't mind a game being short as long as there's replay value in it. The main issue I have is that there isn't really that much to do whilst you're actually playing the game.You have 5 possible actions when making a turn per character:- Treat disease- Quarantine city- Heal operative- Build office- Take sampleThe trouble is that for many turns only 2 of these are actually applicable, as these 3 aren't:- Heal operative is only relevant when your operative is actually injured- Build office can only be used 5 times in the entire game, since you're limited to that many offices- Take sample can be used more often, however you're limited by how many samples you actually need and whether your lab needs them anytime soonThis means that your choice of actions is actually greatly limited and in general you don't have that many courses of action available to you on each turn. Now there is research to be getting on with, but again it's quite limited and doesn't need any input rather than deciding which one to go for (currently there is one that prevents cities being reinfected, which most people tend to aim for).For me and with this being a turn based game I think more depth is needed before I can recommend it. Please don't scream 'BUT IT'S EARLY ACCESS' as I'm well aware of that, but all I can do is review the game in it's current state, not on the promise of things to come (none of which have actually been made yet).I'll happily re-review the game positively if it does improve, but for now I don't think it's worth purchasing."
,Recommended,489370,32637530,Posted: 22 June,all,Starhammer,"I am really enjoying this game. It's an excellent turn based strategy that unlike so many games, has you working to save the world instead of just killing stuff. It feels very much like a multiplayer board game where you're in control of all the players. I think it would be very kid friendly too, since no disease effects are particularly graphic, and there's almost no sense of violence.Since leaving early access, there has still been devlopment, both in the workshop and to the base game. They just put out a balancing patch that I think helped make lesser used classes much more relevant."
76561197990573379,Recommended,489370,29804255,Posted: 9 February,all,LifetSavert911,"The review:So far, the game seems like a great turn based strategy game with a disease stopping theme. It reminds me of Plague Inc. in the way the disease spreads and you must stop it. It also has the characteristics of other turn based strategy games in that you try to make the best decisions each turn to achieve the goal. You have several functions your team can do to research tech, cure parts and eventually the entirety of the disease, quarantine cities, establish more sources of income, and many more. If you like turn based strategy games and games like the theme of Plague Inc., then you MUST buy this title!The Rant:This is a rant about the community of Steam users that have plagued Steam since I bought my first Steam game years ago. You may agree or disagree with what I am saying, but I am saying how I feel. This is the reason I am even reviewing this game already. Feel free to read or ignore. The choice is up to you the same way that the choice to review this game already is up to the customers.It's been 1.5 hours that this game has been available to purchase and play. (As of when I started writing this review and rant.) This means NOBODY can possibly have a negative review already! You got to play a game like this a minimum of 15-20 hours before you can even review it. Since these ridiculous people have already reviewed the game, I will too. As of now I have 1.2 hours being on the game. The 1.2 hours isn’t exact since I had to keep stopping and do something else and I didn’t exit the game while I did, however I will say the I recommend this game so far. I will later update my review when I have an actual amount of time playing this game but for now, I LOVE IT! I don’t know what’s wrong with the people who didn’t give it a positive review, but I will just go ahead and say that you are out of line. You can’t possibly know how you feel about a game that hasn’t even been available for 2 hours yet. You are the same people that ruin good games! I have seriously not bought games based on so many negative reviews. Some of those games I read the negatives and laugh at how that isn’t a real review and how some of the things they say are just plain uneducated. I feel like there are probably a lot of 12 and under year old kids writing reviews. I have been a video gamer since I could barely talk and I am 33 this month. I am the kind of person I would listen to when it comes to a review of a game. I wouldn’t trust somebody who hasn’t even been alive as long as I have been playing games. I remember all the way from Atari to now. I have literally 1,000’s of hours gaming. Some people say that I am ridiculous for spending so much time playing games but I don’t care. Think about how much time people spend on Facebook, Twitter, the internet in general. I used to spend 10 or more minutes just waiting for my online connection to start and these same people complain when their 180+ megabit connection doesn’t load a webpage as fast as they blink. These are the same people who take what could be a great game and destroy it before it even gets off the ground! These are the same people who rate a bunch of early access games negative! Are you kidding me?! If it’s early access and you want to post a positive review, fine. If you post a negative review before it’s released, it can and has caused so many games get abandoned and take so long to get released. Early access itself, is an unfinished game. Why the hell would you say it’s not good already? That’s like going to a bakery and ordering a cake then while it comes out of the oven saying, “No, I don’t like that at all.” This is the community of gamers I call the “jump the gun reviewers” that destroy games with their attitude. Ok, rant over. I just had to get that off my chest. Moral of the story, don’t give negative reviews to early access games or games you only owned for at most an hour and a half.I will edit my review later. If it is negative, I will say why. If it stays positive, I will say why. I will do this because that is how it should be done. Thanks, and have a great time saving the world!"
,Recommended,489370,29866296,Posted: 11 February,all,EdenStarGazer,"It’s revenge for the Plague in a turn-based strategy game that lets you turn the tables on disease and cure the world.Quarantine is exactly the name of the game in this cross between Plague Inc and XCOM. Though, IMHO the game is a junior version of both, with only some of the traits of each. It could almost be a mod for Plague Inc., except that it is a much simpler game.Gameplay:The game is composed of 3 disease types, which need to be beaten on hard mode to 100% the game. This means that theoretically, given you understand the gameplay, you could beat it in 3 games after the short tutorial. But, there are also 4 different classes, like in XCOM. You play with all 4, but you start with your choice, which makes for totally diverse game play depending on your start. You also have 4 different start cities, which seem to me to have little to nothing to do with result. I chose to start with playing the 3 disease types on medium difficulty, each time with a different start class. No problems were encountered. I had all the achieves except for that final one, so I then did the final 3 hard mode games for the win in a total of 8 hours. (6 games) It could have been much less, except I played around with the different classes a bit, and I played totally online the whole time.But, choosing the order of operations, and selecting chokepoints for quarantining cities cost effectively is where most of the fun gameplay comes in. Once you’ve solved the formula for this, there is no replay value at all. Unless of course the game is expanded with dlc that is.Graphics & Art:Given the simplistic system of UI, the graphics and art are both well done. I saw no problems whatsoever. The music and sound effects were great. The men & women operatives had their cliché phrases like in XCOM. They gave their lives willingly if need be. It was an enjoyable experience for me, seeing that sim & tbt are my favorite genre. Very satisfying gameplay I must say, overall, though quite easy. And, if you have problems with that, in the same way that shots can be missed in XCOM (even with 97% chance) you can save & reload whenever you want to beat the rng.Pros:*Balanced gameplay- The system works. Quarantining is effective, classes matter.*Turn based means low pressure. Good saving system.*The operatives are very enjoyable like in XCOM.*Game loads FAST. Instantly saving & reloading. Everything is instant.Cons:*No replay value after earning 100% achievements. Needs an ironman mode.*The individual operatives within a class are only cosmetically different. So, one scientist is the same as the next scientist. This should be changed to give them differing skills within a class.*The game is not enough of a challenge for most gamers. If you want an easy introduction into games like Plague Inc. This is it.*No multiplayer at this time. Totally single player.Quarantine is a game that has about 8 hours of fun to offer, and a hope for more content to come, since the game is in early access at this point.If you want to get in at the beginning of what looks to be a great game, I’d grab this while it is on sale. However, many may want to wait for more content/ lower sales. I’ve had a great evening with the game, and am looking forward to checking back for updates, though I probably won’t play it again until more content is available."
76561198006723728,Recommended,489370,29816482,Posted: 9 February,all,Minsk and Boo,"Quarantine is a fun game, but I worry that the direct action mechanics will never be as deep as the completely indirect mechanics of the obvious comparison, Plague Inc. It took 4 tries to beat medium bacterium, then I beat medium virus and prion first shot (they are much easier than bacterium - why?), then hard bacterium on the first shot. I have not completed all of Plague Inc's organisms at mega-brutal yet.Once you know the system, it's too predictable. AFAIK there is one correct leader and one correct first turn move - that robs players of agency and overall it's a bit shallow for my taste. This will need some deeper introspection from the devs than 'more content' to take it from early access to a solid game.Still gets a thumbs up for a promising game."
,Not Recommended,489370,29847154,Posted: 11 February,all,Tris,"TL;DR The game is way too short for its price.I have played this game for 1 hour and have 12/19 achievements, and have played through the tutorial, Bacteria easy mode, and Bacteria Normal Mode twice. The devs said that there is about 34 hours gameplay, because there are 34 different scenarios (based on the amount of combinations you can make with location, starting operative, and disease (3*4*3). As I have already stated; I have played through 4 scenarios (3 excl tutorial) in 1 hour. If you think about it this way, you have a maximum of 9 hours gameplay, with little variation between each scenario meaning that if you're only playing to get all achievements (as I do in games that can be played without end) it could take as little as 4 or 5 hours to beat this game. Unless the hard mode is a lot harder than the super easy ""normal"" mode, then this game has way too little gameplay, and should either reduce it's price to at least £3.99 or triple the amount of content it currently has."

,Recommended,489370,29808962,Posted: 9 February,all,Tagaziel,"An interesting strategy game where you're saving people instead of killing them. The official promotional materials do a good job of explaining the setup, so I'll skip this part and focus on gameplay.It's a solid turn-based strategy that, at the present, requires thinking and planning. Trying to wing it will only get people killed and the world lost. It's non-linear, dynamic, and offers a number of paths to go through the game, with none being inherently superior.It's also stable and bug-free, although has limited features in its current state. However, after taking a look at the game's files, this initial release is essentially just a vertical slice, with more to come. There's a ton of gameplay elements and wrinkles to come."

,Recommended,489370,29809502,Posted: 9 February,all,Romenics,"Nice little game with interesting texts. Finally a good game where you should save humanity, not to destroy it (like in Plague Inc and a huge amount of its cheap clones).Content not so much, but it's early access, I hope it will be more in future.Do not listen negative reviews about ""low content"" problem. Plague inc have much less content than this game.Also Plague Inc have much simpler gameplay. In Plague Inc you should just rush and click.Here you should read and think."

,Recommended,489370,29823539,Posted: 10 February,all,Cube,"Nice idea, yet with dreadful details. I would like to give a few suggestions.1. Please show a warning if I haven't starting any research when I press 'next round'.2.Different agents are actually nearly the same after a few rounds. Some of there abilities are getting more and more useless. For instance, a doctor can heal up to 5 points, but each city only got 4. Maybe there could learn some ultra skills after reaching the top level.3. Earth is a globe, so diseases may move through Bering Straits from North America to Asia. I found North America the garden of Eden, natuarly isolated form the outside world. And since Australia is so far from South Africa, it is a little untrue to see they been linked.Ps, thank you very much for well Chinese translating."

I have no regrets picking it up, but I do sort of have an unhealthy interest in disease.Update: Just broke 3 hours in and beat the 3 pathogens on Hard.Fun game, and I still do recommend it but it is really rather short. Hopefully some new teammates and disease types are added along with something else to spice it up. Once you get your method down (For me its 2 Medic, Scientist and Diplomat (or 3rd Medic depending on who I start with) it becomes rather easy. After struggling with Bacteria on Hard I beat Prion on my second try and Virus on my first.Still, fun game just needs some more meat."

Edit: done.The price is pretty questionable for what there is right now. I don't subscribe to the idea that games can be reduced to a simple cost/hour formula, but all the same, I do feel like a game that only really has a few hours in it should probably be under £10 unless it has something special to recommend it, which this game doesn't. It's stable and performant, and it's fun enough, but it's not going to be blowing anyone away, and it's not a game you'll be remembering for years, so I feel like maybe £6-7 would be more appropriate - at that price point it would be a definite thumbs up.That said, it's only been in early access a couple of weeks and has some potential for expansion in both content and tactical depth. If you like XCOM but sometimes want something a bit more casual - a shorter session with less in depth analysis needed at every move - then this fits the bill."

Currently game is playable, there are not bugs or glitches or technical issues.

I'd love to see more actions (maybe political stabilization, because diplomat is useless), the game would benefit from some tradeoffs (sent your agent for one turn to do fundraising or send back to the lab or gather more samples to speed up the research). Currently tactical layer is interesting but obvious (I started to think about variants maybe three times on hard scenario).Graphic works well, text descriptions (agent bios and random events) add flavour. I'd love more stat element in agents and in regions.At this moment the game is slightly overpriced for the lack of content, but enjoyable and rather interesting.

This game is pretty good for the price tag, but it lacks one thing. Replayability. You can easily learn how to beat this game even on the hardest difficulty, and once you get a certain strategy that works it is pretty likely that you will keep using it.This game reminds me of another disease outbreak game called Pandemic which is free online, except in Pandemic your goal is to wipe out the human race, although Madagascar always never gets infected!!!Overall I would say this is a good game, except again for replayability, and considering this is a simulation game of you staring at one screen it's not like the graphics matter to much considering it doesn't take much to run.I give this game:6.5 / 10 Cabbages on the would Play Again Scale.7 / 10 Cabbages on the Price Scale.4.5 / 10 Cabbages on the Difficulty Scale--------------------------------------------------------------Edit-------------------------------------------------------------------------This game got alot more harder due to the update they did so here is some more updated stuff...Music: The music soundtrack in Quarantine is repetitive and gets annoying after a while, this however doesn’t matter because at least in my case I would zone out and the music was just there.Graphics: The game doesn’t take much to play and isn’t resource intensive. The only real difference between high and low quality is the sharpness of the gameplay and the framerate.Gameplay: Let’s talk about this in two ways, release and now February 16, 2017.Release:•	The game was too easy and could easily be beaten with no strategy other than getting the medic as your starter and getting a certain trait that makes it so any city healed is 100% healed until re-infected by a nearby city. This strategy took easily about 8 game turns to achieve and the traits don’t cost any money.•	The game didn’t take as much strategy to beat and really had no consequences.•	The diseases weren’t that potent and were laughable, I never loss at release.February 16, 2017:•	The game got an update and let’s just say it made the game a lot harder, they also moved the stronger traits around so it wasn’t so easy to abuse.•	The game actually required strategy.•	The diseases were very potent and spread relatively fast.I now give this game:6.5 / 10 Cabbages on the would Play Again Scale.6 / 10 Cabbages on the Price Scale.7 / 10 Cabbages on the Difficulty Scale"

,Recommended,489370,31967647,Posted: 26 May,all,BarkerBlast,"I recommend this game, however I didn't really enjoy it. The concept is great, but my main issues are as follows.1) Clicking a button after you send someone to do a task seems pointless and annoying. I want to treat one city, and go straight to treat the next with another working, I don't want to have to acknowledge that i've made a move, a simple voice 'task complete' would be great.2) End of game is achieved when you research all the strains. The last strain took 4 days, which makes me feel the last 4 moves to the pointless. The dieases was only at 20/60, 4 moves of not treating any city would have still had me win the game. If the game is going to operate this way then it should know that i'm researching the last strain, the virus won't overtake the world in 4 days, and I should instantly win. A lot of people have referred to this as a reverse Plague Inc, and that's because it is (and Plague Inc is an amazing game). What makes it good till the every end is when when the cure is developing (which varies in speed based on how bad the virus is), you still have a chance to distroy the world, you can mutate the virus and research immunity to antibiotics to set back and slow the cure. Surely this game could implement a strategy that even once the cure is researched it's not an instant win, the tables can still be turned. Granted I was playing this on easy, but I was disappointed at the end."

It's one of those games that achieve a lot of depth with a slim feature set.I played some of the easier scenarios so far, and i like how the difficulty curve is gradually rising. On easy, one can play relatively short sessions and have a satisfying result. I imagine the harder scenarios will also take more time.Looking forward to what users will post in the Workshop!"

Thus, I wanted to play but didn't enjoy it.  Well, this game scratches that itch!  This game is beautifully presented and has great potential and if the Developers live up to their forum ""promises"" of more content, this game will become a gem.  The high expectations for Early Access games don’t always materialize but people should RATE THIS GAME ON ITS POTENTIAL, which is easy to see, and not just because right now there are some issues.  Realize please, that's the essence of Early Access, progressive improvement and rate the game on how you envision it to be, not on weaknesses you see now.   I will agree that out of the chute this game screams for a little more content (especially new Scenarios) but the Developers have ""promised"" those things are coming.  Support the game folks, I highly recommend it.  And Developers, please (PLEASE!) keep up the good work!"

It needs more scenario's and maybe a Co-op feature to play with your friends, like one is the virus that needs to destroy the world and the other is the one to create a vaccine. The graphics are good, The sound is nice too, But the game get's a bit the same on every scenario the only difference I could spot was at Ebola the virus only expanded to other cities, I had only 1 city go up to a level 2. It still needs some more scenario's IMO, but the rest is nice! I like the concept of creating a vaccine to prevent the world from dying. it's like Plague Inc. but this time you're saving the world instead of destroying it."

,Recommended,489370,29820967,Posted: 10 February,all,bricker513,"After playing a couple of games i must note that the graphics are quite good here, infact the whole art style and the way the global map is displayed really fits in nicely, also selecting your heroes in kinda new mechanic for me which gives you more variety when it comes to winning the game. Althou the tech tree could use more split upgrade brances where you could choose more upgrades from each level of tiers. Curing the desease process is made interesting where you pick part of the desease and start to develop a cure for it. The random events in the game also leave me curious whether it impacts the gameplay or just for the general feel of the gameplay process. As a Plague inc. player i feel like this game has the starting material that could be more improved and polished given the time and resource... but not bad for a game in early access."

Plague inc runs in real time and allows the player to use DNA points to evolve interesting abilities and symptoms.Quarantine is a boring turn based game where the ""plague"" can only jump between connected cities (how unrealistic), and there is no mention of symptoms. Every infection is boring basic ""bacteria"" or ""virus"".Thoroughly unengaging, uninteresting and unrealistic. Save your money."

76561198032842878,Recommended,489370,29853690,Posted: 11 February,all,Manuel Calavera,"*Early Access Review*The game has great potential... (and I loved the boardgame that inspired it)edit:I did not recommend this game in my previous review yet, because the game did not have enough strategy, difficulty and replay value. Luckily, the developers have listened to the community feedback and the gameplay has improved a lot since the last update. (Basically all my concerns with the game have been fixed since then)- the starting location matters now- there are more diffences between the ""heroes"" you can choose: with the addition of movement points you really have to choose now: Do I want someone who is fast, who can take a lot of hits or someone who can heal better?- the events in the game are more interesting and diverseFor those who liked ""Pandemic"" the board game:The core of the game is the same: find a strategy to heal a pandemic outbreak with limited resources and a disease that gets worse every turn. There is a big difference though: this is a single player experience, so you won't have the discussions between the players on what to do next. However the game makes up for it in several ways:- Good graphics: clean but charming interface that is easy to understand- More randomness: events have a chance to fail (you can see the success-% before you choose)- Easier to understand: you don't have to read the rules first - you can always see what you are allowed to do and what you can't do (and why)This game is still in early access and there is room for improvement, but it's already in a very good state. And I haven't experienced a single bug yet. (sadly this is a big feature nowadays^^)Conclusion (TLDR):You should try this game if you like strategy games but don't want to spend hours for each game. Each game is short but interesting. It is not as deep as CIV or some other big strategy titles - and it shouldn't be: i can easily finish a game in under an hour, but then i want to start again... see what changes, what i could make differently. And the feeling of doom when the disease spreads to another continent just gets me every time :-)"

The scenarios use the same global map with no variations and each virus has pretty much the same behavior.
