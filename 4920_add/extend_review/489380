The free alpha was better than most paid games for months and I'm glad it finally hit Early Access. Bow mechanics are fantastic, the gameplay with adjusting difficulty level, multiple types of enemies, various power ups, items to collect are all top notch. Graphics are very good with artists from some of the well known AAA studios providing the art work.Great for both solo and co-op. I can't recommend this one enough."
,Recommended,489380,28482601,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,IronPanda,"If you own a Vive, this is the defining game imo. It's great to be part of the evolution of this game and be able to compensate the dev for all the hard work he's put into what has been up until a free game.You're defending a series of gates along a canyon. If your team is good enough you can push forward and take more gates. Fail and you're driven back and have to defend. There's a good variety of enemies, all that time playing Quivr isn't wasted because the bow dynamics are still excellent and you need to mix it up against airborne and some very fast ground based attackers.Unlike a lot of games you're not going to feel overwhelmed if you're in there as part of a multiplayer team too.Cons: Wear and tear on the trigger from furiously nocking arrowsToo much time playing this when i should be doing stuff in the real world."
,Recommended,489380,28506975,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,B_Squared,This is my favorite game on the vive.  The bow mechanics are spot on and it's such a great feeling to aim an arrow and hit something far away.  The co-op multiplayer adds a lot of strategy into the game(if you want to survive).  The developer has taken this game so far from his initial tech demo and is constantly listening to the community feedback.I can't wait to see where they take this game... Looking forward to some epic archery battles on a giant!!

The slight vibration in the controllers makes it feel like I'm actually drawing the bow. You can feel the tension in the bow and feel when you have drawn the bow far enough for your shot .Slightly twisting either of your hands changes how your arrow flies. To move you shoot an arrow through a blue check point. It can be a little off setting but there's a clear direction your pov will be. I have only played a couple days and haven't had much multi-player voice chat but so far my experience has been fluid whether or not I could hear other players.There's bow and arrow games out there for sure. I love the multi-player action. If I want to defend the wall, hold mid, or snipe it's all an option. Grabbing arrows from your quiver can be a little derpy. I'm just opening boosts and gear upgrades. Overall if you want to play a bow and arrow shooter I definitely reccomend it."

The other thing that I noticed, which really surprised me, is how good the bow mechanics and draw are (having spent many years on archery ranges). The bow ""feel"" is very similar to my American Flatbow which sadly doesn't get anywhere near enough use these days. Hat off to the developer.

,Recommended,489380,31895299,Posted: 21 May,all,Brigand Boy,"EDIT: Just so it is clear, the developers ARE ACTIVE and ARE UPDATING THE GAME.Pretty important to point out considering the derth of early access cash grabs for VR. This seems to be a game that is actually undergoing improvements.===========================================Okay, let's get the bad things out of the way first:1) It seems to be one level total, with 4 ""areas"" inside the level, so it can get repetative simply because the scenery remains the same throughout. It's early access, so hopefully that will change.2) Some strange things can happen when you use a teleport arrow in the wrong place...3) Pulling the string back to the side of your face sometimes results in the arrow jittering, making it hard to aim as if it were a real bow and arrow.That's it.So on to the good. The aiming mechanics are top-notch (ha! puns!), and the rumble effects from the vive controllers makes it feel like you are pulling a string, throwing a bomb, releasing an arrow,  or grabbing an arrow.Arrows fly in what feels like a natural flight path, and it's consistent, so you learn quickly how they fly and how they land.The hit detection is very well done, such that I know it's my fault when I miss, not the game's.The music is repetative, but not annoying, and it changes up during boss battles, giving you that extra bit of tension (more puns!).The graphics are superb, even if you turn some things down to maintain a good FPS rate.The items you unlock during play actually add to the gameplay, with teleportation arrows, scatter arrows, proximity mines, time-slowing grenades, fire grenades, and more available as the game progresses.The enemies vary well enough that as the level gets progressively harder, the enemies become  more varied (fog, speed, bombs, teleporting, and launching mortars at you and your team). The landscape may be the same old level, but the fighting never seems to get old.Multiplayer is hands down the best part of the game, as with a group, it becomes much quicker to get to the higher (and more intense) parts of the level. Plus, it's super weird and fun to wave to people who aren't really in your room with you and have them wave back.To top it all off, if you get some 1-3lbs wrist weights, this game ends up being one hell of a workout, which is pretty cool considering how fun it is.10/10 would shoot alien orcs in the face again."
,Recommended,489380,28771648,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Kalazor,"I played with Rift and Touch controllers using 2 sensors at opposite corners of my play area. I had to move my setup around to get good 360 coverage, which was 100% neccesary since you often have to turn and shoot behind, even if's just to retreat. The 2 sensor setup was good enough for me to play well without losing tracking. I had 2 crashes in the first hour I played that I couldn't figure out a reason for. I also had trouble keeping my arm up and by the end of a session I was missing most of my shots just duie to fatigue, but that's not something that I hold against the game.The objective is simply to survive as long as possible by teleporting between preset platforms (by shooting them) and killing enemies before they break your doors down. You can teleport to special gate towers that close large gates and prevent enemies from spawning behind them. There are currently 3 gates, and a really cool suprise near the last gate that hints at future levels and stories, and actually shows some promise of good storytelling through environment design.This is definitely a game that's worth playing now, and I'm excited to see it at release quality."

More enjoyable than The Lab's rudimentary (albeit cute and fun for a while) archery. I love the movement and the objective of closing gates all while fending off waves. Multiplayer makes it all the more plausible and potentially more fun if I had actual friends. The graphical update is quite amazing as well--way better than it originally started out as in the earliest demo. Bravo!Equipment upgrades, for the moment, seem a bit limited, but I've only just begun. Most seem useless and I have no idea what to do with the Motes, but I like the concept and I could see a lot more being done with different skills and upgrades. Perhaps that's all still under development?"
,Recommended,489380,30991677,Posted: 6 April,all,Caindris,"I enjoy this game even if it is woefully short and I find it really hard to justify for $20 considering what it is.  If all you're looking for is a better bow simulator then what's offered in The Lab then I would get this game but only if it's on sale.There's also a lot to not like about this game.  It's only two player and having an extra person, while fun, doesn't exactly add a lot of depth.  At no point did my cohort and I feel overwhelmed or like communication was necessary.There's a lot of ambiquity in the game and the tutorial doesn't fill you in on much except how to shoot.  There are purple crystals that you can shoot that do.... something?  You get gear for defeating each boss (sometimes - more then a few times I got ""duplicate item"" and would be rewarded with re-spec crystals) or re-spec crystals if you lose.  One boss is a rock monster that is stupidly laughable and a hell hound that has frustrating artillary requiring you to move often.  I actually enjoyed this mechanic at first but after multiple repeats you get tired of zone hopping while trying to turn the dog into a pin coushin.Gear upgrades are pretty blah as are the effects.  I never once had a use for the blocking pillar arrow and the regen field lasted too short and got too few enemies in it to be of use.  Bottom line - I don't get excited at the idea of upgrades/respecs and that's frustrating as it diminishes the replayability.Travel, conceptually, is a neat idea.  You shoot an arrow through the ring at the point you want to get to and you teleport.  In practice this doesn't really work as the moment you get under pressure from too many mobs you'll be missing shots for locations you want to be at so you just end up holding choke points.  Plus some areas are either hard to see, hard to hit, or give no tactical value.  I think it would be better replaced with a wrist flip/hud map.Shoulder vs hip arrows - I hate the shoulder arrows as I kept smacking my Vive head unit but the hip arrows have weird grab distances.  Either I would miss them completely or I could grab them in front of me out of thin air.Having said all of that it's still a fun game that makes you feel like you're doing a mini version of Helm's Deep and if picked up on the cheap should be added to your library."

It definitely has some improving to do, and is obviously still in early accesss.  But, there is very frequent updates being rolled out.  Hopefully some more diverse vistas are in the works for the near future.All other archery games will quiver in their boots and bow their heads. (yep, i went there)"

The visuals are great, the immersion is top-notch, the core archery mechanic is spot on, and the abilities are interesting and impactful without drastically lessening the difficulty. The limiting factor on my play time isn't boredom, but my arms getting too tired to keep shooting accurately! Which is, by the way, a good thing - even though it's not billed as a fitness game, I'm getting more exercise from it than I have from Wii games intended for the purpose, because I want to just keep playing! And that's with it in its Early Access state. There's only one map currently (as far as I can tell), and there are a couple bugs involving the equipment mannequin in the keep displaying the wrong items' info and the reforge/disenchant altar becoming unresponsive. Once those minor glitches are fixed and the developer puts in more variety, it might actually eat my soul."

No other game on my entire early access list comes close to the level of dedication this developer puts in on a continual basis day after day.Also the game is fantastic, the bow mechanics are very good, the thwack of killing your enemies is even greater and with the option of having different skills due to armor peices makes this EASILY one of the best games I have ever supported.

Now give the tower special abilities and spells which are acquired through a diablo-like loot roll after each crushing defeat.Now imagine you could play with other players where their skill doesn't deter from your experience whatsoever. Where you can both appreciate a particularly sweet shot, or display of skill.Imagine all this can be done with minimal use of menus, hotkeys, and other user interface artifacts from PC gaming that break your immersion.Finally, imagine that game is still being worked on by the developer, who regularly reads the forums, listens to feedback, and develops the game around that feedback (such as optional personal space bubbles to prevent trolling, implementing break periods, and other improvements)That thing you're imagining...that's this game!

The graphics are unpolished, there's only one map, which isn't complete, some of the effects fail to function as intended, or are only visible to other users, the game is unoptomized and can be sluggish and buggy at times, the arrow physics are occasionally a little wonky, and the multiplayer community is a bit sparse...But man is it fun! It's hard to describe that little thrill that comes from landing a headshot and taking out a tough enemy with a single arrow at the last second, but getting that clutch shot is so satisfying.QuiVR is a workout though. Waving little controllers around pretending to shoot a bow may look easy, but when you've got to hold it rock-steady and line up your shot, it can be very physically taxing if you're not prepared for it.I'm very excited about the future of this game, and I look forward to playing lots more."

Its archery mechanics are superb; it gives you this awesome feel of being some hardcore LoTR ranger fighting off hordes of magic, glowing orcs. It's stylized and beautiful, and the multipilayer is seamlessly implemented. Mix that with post-game loot that gives really cool special effects, like splintering your arrows into a hail that ricochets off of surfaces or making headshots cause AoE explosions.It's not a terribly long story-driven experience, but it doesn't need to be. Your arms get really tired, so the drop-in-drop-out wave-defense style fits the game perfectly. QuiVR is ranking among the funnest times I've had in VR, and is absolutey worth checking out."

It would be interesting if the keep had some activity going on.The large boss in the back looked really impressive. Can't wait for that to be implemented.I'm interested in seeing what other abilities we can gain from the armor. It looks like we lost the skill tree from the previous version and it was replaced with the loot mechanic. The motes are currently a mystery to me but I've got 15! Maybe there will be some sort of store in the future which would play well with making the keep more lively and look like there was actually something to protect.All in all, Quivr is a really nice title.

My wife has a Vive, and I have a Rift with Touch, and the game provides us the option to play together in a private lobby. In regards to gameplay, it's like a much more fleshed out version of the archery game from The Lab.It's a little rough around the edges, but as it's currently an early access game it's understandable. One issue is that the loot, gear, motes, and gate system isn't well explained in the game. Though a quick look in the discussion section of this game on Steam answered any questions I had. Also, it would be nice for the host of the multiplayer session to be able to pause the timer in between games so that new gear could be examined or rerolled without feeling rushed.At it's core, however, the gameplay mechanics are excellent, the developer listens to the community and seems to be frequently updating the game, and the only reason I've ended play sessions so far is because my arms end up exhausted and never because I get bored."

This game has more subtance than the many 'wave shooters' already available. The aim is to defend your fort, and you have the option of doing this in single or multiplayer mode. Mutiplayer mode is the most enjoable and I was surprised I did not experience any frame drops compaired to other multiplayer games. Definitely worth the purchase."

The game is under constant development by a developer who seems to pay attention to the community. In the two weeks that I've had the game, I have already seen great improvements over what was already a fun game. I highly recommend this to people who like archery / wave shooters. If you're not sure about it, download the demo and try it out.PROs:- Great Archery model- Multiplayer difficulty scales with number of people- Different abilities with equipment- I personally like the hitboxes for the enemies- Variety of enemies with different ""tactics"" for killing each- multiple gates instead of just one- Constantly improved by Dev- Bosses have been added to provide a win condition- Difficulty ramping has improved greatly- Dev is constantly updating. From when I first posted this review in Jan 2017 to now (April 2017) every single one of my CONs has been addressed.This game is amazing. If you're on the fence, try the demo."

I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but it's nice to see the devs have been so active even in this short time scale and new things are added all the time.In terms of the game itself, the mechanics and controls feel intuitive and natural. With only a little bit of practice, if feels as though you are really using the bow and you have a lot of control over the angle, distance, power etc. rather than just feeling like pointing and clicking.Even without an end goal it became addictive, so with the implementation of win conditions, you can really see it coming together. I would recommend this to anyone with a vr headset as a must for your library."

No zombies here - basically otherworldly creatures (not humans but very artfully crafted - many types with differing abilities). Includes air targets. When I was gaming using Vive 'Vanishing Realms' was my favorite and this is just as good (in another way) IMHO. The scenery is very cool (literally) and sound is top notch. Your garb and abilities increase in stature as credits are gained (primarily in multiplayer mode). Multiplayer - several bowman working in concert - is where this game truly shines!

76561198040176843,Recommended,489380,29046332,Posted: 5 January,all,Tdore,"I really love this game. At its base, it is a Wave Defense game where you use a bow and arrow, but it has the formula very well refined.Firstly, the archery gameplay is great. I came from Holopoint as my only other VR archery experience, and QuiVR blows it out of the water. Instead of having the aim be based only on the bow hand like in that Holopoint, it aims based on the location of both hands, which makes it much more comfortable and easy to aim.The objective of the game is to defend a series of gates from hordes of enemies. You can take gates by standing on their ""Portals"", and once a gate is taken that becomes the new point of defense. Once a gate is destroyed, you can revive the gate provided you have the right equipment, and you get enough headshots. (You can get the gear you need early on.) And, as time continues, the game gets more difficult, so it never gets stale.So, the game becomes a push and pull between taking and defending gates, and it really does feel great when you can retake a gate, or kill the boss right before he knocks down the final gate.Additionally, you get different pieces of gear as rewards for playing, each giving its own special powerup to assist in your efforts.One of my favorite parts of the game is the development of it. Blueteak, the developer, has been making consistent and clear changes based on feedback the community has been giving. In fact, I suggested a change and a few others agreed with me, and Blueteak had it in the game THE NEXT DAY.Honestly, that is what Early Access should be. Blueteak has really earned my respect.In short:- Great development with consistent updates and community interaction- Comfortable archery gameplay that is easy to pick up and fun to master- Fun ""objective"" wave defense that gives you more than just 'stand here and shoot'- Changing difficulty means you'll be hard pressed to find boredom- Strong multiplayer adds a lot of funIf you have a Vive, I would HIGHLY recommend this game. Try the demo and see for yourself!"

Basically it's the same as the single player, but others may or may not join your game to help out, so in my opinion multiplayer just seems to be unreliable cheating. Also the amount of content is very much lacking considering the price; I imagine the developers are intending to include much more and are pricing it so that they aren't burned after they put in the intended effort, but having seen too many ambitious games abandoned I think this game is quite a risk at its current state of developement."

You may have a tall purch, or a cliff to stand on, but none of that is needed...you just stand in the middle as the enemie run by you and you shoot them in the back.Right now, even in EA with a $20 tag I can not reccomend this game. It lacks in every category (Gameplay, Audio, Graphics/Animation)"

Very awkword bow shooting compared to longbow in The Lab, considering that the lab is free you can pretty much have a better experience on a free game instead of 20 dollars. I would recommend this to someone who loves to play archery games but me, i would rather buy raw data (super fun and awesome). The enemies are really boring because they don`t attack the just kind of run to the gate and hit. I only put this at negative really because there are more cons than pros. In reality I would give this a medium, definetly need to create different levels and make things easyier to forge. If I could get my money back I would do it and spend it on a different game. Overpriced for such little gameplay, also can be very glitchy while trying to teleport."

Changing the bow draw mechanic to match a non over-the-shoulder style like The Lab's longbow would likely solve all these problems.This game makes me want to punch the developer. Three times I punched my own headphones because of the over the shoulder bow draw requirement combined with the frantic nature of the game, causing my ears to ring badly. Further, I played the game over and over for an hour and couldn't seem to beat even the first area. The boss forces you to constantly jump between teleporting zones or sit out from the game for 5 seconds. It's like it was designed to be team based-only, yet clicking the online mode didn't seem to do anything besides a target practice best score competition."

Most of these wave-based shooters bore me because there is no replay value besides trying to get a high score.  This game is different because at the end of each match, you get a random Diablo-style piece of loot.  I'm not sure how the randomness works, but it seems like the better your score at the end of a match, the better the drop rate is.  These can be for your head, chest, hand, quiver, bow, or arrow.  This loot can change your abilities, for example I first got a chestpiece that allows me to crit enemies every 15 seconds.  There seems is a currency system that can be used to re-roll the stats on gear.Basically, if you like archery (play the demo to see if you do) and you want a game with lots of loot, then this is a great game to get!"

You play them for a while, get bored, and move on to the next.   Not so with QuiVR...QuiVR is an example of an early release indie game done right.  Wile seemingly counter intuitive the difference between good and great is more often found in thesmalldetails.  Attention to detail is where devs and, ultimately, the games they produce distinguish themselves from the pack and where QuiVR excels.You'll find the game environment and atmospherics are so ""natural"" that full immersion takes place almost as soon as you get off the couch.  (You'll probably bump/punch your TV or monitor a few times as well)The archery mechanics are some of the best (and most demanding) I've encountered.  The arrows go where you aim them so if you want to hit the bad guys consistently you're probably going to spend a lot of time at the target range.  The bow can be fined tuned to player's preference and the accuracy, distance, and combo metrics are a nice touch.The multiplayer was a very pleasant surprise.  I hopped into a game at midnight just to check it outfor a few minutesbefore bed and found myself on a team of lethal long range assassins who were not only skilled archers but commuinicative- via in-game voice chat- and cooperative  team mates.  I removed my headset after ""a few minutes"" and it was 3:00 AM! The foam lining of my HMD was soaked with sweat and my arms/shoulders were QuiVR-ing from fatigue.  Turns out that not only is the game immersive, engaging, and intense but it's also a legitimate form of calesthenics.  I killed 50 orcs and lost a few pounds in the process.The dev(s) actively communicate changes, are responsive to player feedback, and encourage input and ideas to improve the game.All around good experience and well worth the price."

At the time of this writing I have around 7 hours into it.Without hesitation I would recommend this game.  So far its my favorite of the games I have played and I find it fun. The developer appears to be very active too which is also a nice thing to see considering the graveyard of abandoned games out there.The only complaint I have is the co-op Multiplayer does not seem entirely stable.  I can normally play for around 30 minutes before the game crashes.  With that said, the multiplayer is fun, just needs some refinement.**Detailed Random Thoughts**In a nut shell, the game is a tower / zone archery defense consisting of 4 areas that are increasingly harder to defend.  A zone is secured by holding a certain point on the map until a gate closes, allowing the player to advance to the next zone.  These gates prevent spawns from occuring behind them, but are destructible and need to be protected.Locomotion is handled in this game with basic room scale for fine movement and teleportation circles activated by passing an arrow through them for coarse movement.  Each zone consists of several defensive vantage points that the player can teleport to using these circles.  Some vantage points are towers, others are landscape.  As the zones progress the vantage points become more difficult through either distance, height, or target angle providing the attacking waves with an advantage.  Later items allow the player to temporarily travel to any spot on the map for a limited period of time.Difficult is increased linearly as time progresses, but the rate can increase based on certain in game events happening.  As difficulty increases the quantity, rate, travel speed, and powers of the attackers increases.When the round ends, the difficult determines the special item or currency you get.  Currently currency has no in-game feature.  The special items grant different offensive, defensive, and support powers to the players.I find the bow mechanics engaging and realistic, and a good mild exercise too.The current level seems well thought out and a decent amount of polish applied for a early release game.I look forward to seeing what else comes along."

Besides all the great gameplay aspects which you can prob read on the other reviews, something I find that sticks out from even non-VR games is the development process of this game.The developer (Blueteak), in my opinion, has suspended the idea of this being ""his"" project. It has become the community's project in the sense that he HEAVILY listens to feedback and is extremely responsive to it, while still maintaining a necessary amount of control/balance. Additionally the daily reports/patches keep everyone informed on what is going on which is another huge thing for me with Early Access games.as for some cons:The structure of the game itself can be a little repetative but thats just the nature of it. This is mainly a heads up to those who don't like this, again try the demo. This could change in the future though. Also some performance issues here and there, those have been acknowledged in patch notes [0.31.2] . Finally I would probably like to see the dev team get bigger but with the savage financial struggle that is VR development, you can't place much blame there.8/10 this game still has even more potential. If you are doubtful of purchasing at least try the demo. You could definitely still wait a while if you aren't really set on buying it (ADD IT TO UR WISHLIST). If you like it enough you should also realize that being part of it early on will allow you to be able to shape the game in small ways with feedback which I think is what Early Access should really be about.

,Recommended,489380,28963181,Posted: 2 January,all,verblox,"The base of QuiVr's appeal is its longbow mechanic. It feels really good to shoot; the arrow responds differently depending on how far you draw, and it aims along the line between your hands. Lining up shots and releasing the string is very satisfying.My only ding is that it's still in early access, so the performance can be inconsistent. For instance, the difficulty balance was off last week after some updates. But the game is under constant development, the dev is very responsive. If something's not right, I know two things: 1) it's in the service of an improvement of game play and 2) it will be addressed shortly.But even with the rough patches, it's still one of the first games I play when I put on my Vive."

Blueteak is just amazing at keeping on top of updates and really listening to the community.QuiVr has got to be one of the best VR experiences of 2016 (and maybe even 2017) especially with the multiplayer!

Yes, the monsters look a little bland and could use some balancing. Sometimes it lags, there is no server browser.But QuiVR gets the basics perfect. The shooting is so good! It's very difficult but you can definitely improve at it.QuiVR feels like a skill you can hone and master.I've played it until my shoulder hurt and then some more.The Loot system is in infancy but already funThe multiplayer presence is so strong! You can wave at your buddies, stick arrows in their hands or face, you can tell when other players are stretching or moving around. It is TONS of fun online! There is a push-to-talk (grip to talk) feature in-game so the multiplayer is engaging but not invasive.The spectator mode is incredible! Press both touch pads at once and you become and GIANT ghost that can look down on the other players (that now appear only a few centimeters high)... this is cooler than I can describe! I LOVED that! The other players still see you, giant and floating in the sky, sometimes they don't know what you're doing and panic! it's hilarious. Great great great feature.QuiVR is very good right now and I am convinced it will be great as development goes on. The game gets frequent upgrades and the developer often directly addresses the player's concern (expressed on the steam forums or reddit etc)I love this game"

I'm getting on every single day at this point just to see what the dev's been adding and changing for at least one round. I may not have a lot of playtime yet, but that's because I'm currently sharing my Vive, but I see that playtime changing rapidly. This dev, at least at the time of writing, has been making DAILY updates and has actually completely restored my lost hope in Early Access titles. It's always improving in every way I could possibly imagine (and in ways that I haven't thought of yet but still absolutely love) and I look forward to looking at the news feed each morning to see what's been changed. If you have a Vive (Or I guess an Oculus Touch now?) and you're considering getting this game.. well.. Stop considering it and just do it already. It's well worth your money. You deserve a game this fun and the dev deserves the purchase price in full for the amount of time and effort he's pouring into this project."

,Recommended,489380,30071241,Posted: 20 February,all,GoldenRetroGames,"I generally don't write reviews of games.  Not because I have liked or disliked games in the past, but mainly because I'm rarely driven to take the time to write a review.I just finished an hour long session of Quivr.  It was the first time I've played it since I tried the alpha months ago.  I'm so impressed with how development of the game has been progressing.  It's also very apparent that the developer has a very strong focus on making the gameplay feel right.This has now replaced the Longbow game in The Lab as my favorite archery game on the Vive.  The bow mechanics feel so natural.  There's also a good amount of strategy to the game, which manages to keep you on your toes at all times.The only negative for me at the moment is that I did have a few hiccups in the frame rate on my system at 2.0x supersampling.  I'm running a 4790k and a GTX1080.  I'd imagine there's still some optimization to come, so I'm hoping this will get smoothed out in upcoming releases."

You loose the arrow and, as it starts to arc, you can tell you lined it up perfectly. 100 meters away, an unsuspecting monster is struck down.Be warned, this may ruin all over bow games for you because no one else has nailed the mechanic as perfectly as Bluetak did in QuiVR."

Every match I've played I've enjoyed, and when my arms get extremely tired I just keep going because the team needs me.All it needs is a little more variation.

My advice is to play the multiplayer portion of the game as it unlocks equipments faster.The game itself is not perfect since the number of levels available is limited (the last level/area has Coming Soon written so there will be more areas to play with in the future?) and the engine itself needs to be optimized since on my PC with GTX 1080, the game lags a bit in most area which is evident when you have your bow and arrow and point them swiftly from side to side. The game is not really clear as well on how to unlock equipments.But all in all, playing multiplayer provides the best fun and you can totally be immersed in this tower defense game for hours."

The whole shooting expirience is very satisfying since you have to reach behind your back to get an arrow (you can cheat a bit and just touch your chest to get one as well).The enemies are interesting and there is a lot of positions to shoot from. The equipment system is also enjoyable, escpecially if you find a glove with a special abilite like a scatter shot for example.Multiplayer is also fun and easy to get into.
