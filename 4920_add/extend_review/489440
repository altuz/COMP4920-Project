I have been playing it on the Steam controller and it been fantastic. Ill upload steam controller configuration when I get a chance. Got to get back to shaking hands with bonies.

Town layout is not great in some levels, and you can wander around with everyone dead just looking for the exit.  Some areas require more precision than the controls allow, forcing you to lose large numbers of your guys.Still, for $1, it is great fun for an hour or two.  And very friendly evil.  I recommend it."

,Not Recommended,489440,25861788,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,"""Bob"" the Space Cadet","Tentacult is a perfect example of a great concept executed badly.At first it's quite fun, even cathartic, watching people scream and run away as you attempt tomutilate their bodies and release the octopus demon from withinbefriend them, but the numerous problems that build up as you play and make Tentacult seem more like an early access game than a final version. The two worst offenders making this game feel unfinished are grouping/path-finding and the level design.Grouping/path-finding - everyone seems to be having trouble with this. You can get your little buddies to clump together by pressing space, or on an Xbox controller by double tapping (for some reason?) the A button. Pressing these buttons will only help if your newly converted friends are within a certain limited radius, but if they have gotten themselves wedged somewhere, prepare for some tedious maneuvering or leave them behind.Level design - it's really unpolished and includes a lot of unclear obstacles. There are invisible walls that block you, and visible walls that you can walk through. Numerous times I have experienced clipping through the ground, and sometimes (what I assume people are mistaking for the ability to jump) being ejected into the air due to obstacles or sometimes for no apparent reason. I could be wrong about that; maybe there is a jump button, but nothing on my keyboard or Xbox controller seemed to do it and since the in game controls only list WASD for movement and nothing else (not even space for clumping), I'm assuming the ""jumping"" is caused by flaws in the level design.Some of the later levels can be frustrating so the urge to give up may be great. I struggled through to the end and was rewarded withnothing. The final level was just used to show you the credits, written on the road you walk along, and there was no end cinematic! I assume there was meant to be one because you LITERALLY GO TO THE CINEMA, but no, it just kind of ends and you quit the game feeling disappointed.Despite it's problems I do like Tentacult; it just has too many issues for me to be able to recommend it to anyone else.4/10 fun, but frustrating and flawed"

My only issue with it right now is the grouping, it seems to be a bit of a hassle to navigate without leaving a few behind. It could also just be me not playing right. Either way, good job developers, this game is a load of fun. 8/10 for me. I really reccomend it. Come on, it's a buck."

There's a little bit of strategy, puzzle solving, and luck involved. Some of the later levels can get frustrating and confusing, but heck, it's only a dollar. Just play it and enjoy making people run in fear."

I love the music and was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it was to cause chaos and destruction.I would recommend making the controls a bit more clear; I wasn't sure exactly how to successfully jump, as I only could one time and only saw the binds for the controls at the main menu. Also, the dialogue box should A) pause the game, and B) disappear upon clicking the over arrow at the last frame."

76561197989804353,Not Recommended,489440,25825298,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Lord Longlegs,"I so wanted to give this game a positive review or would of settled for a neutral option but the bugs are a game breaker for me. The game starts off so well & is indeed both fun & funny but the difficulty ramps up very quickly & the bugs start to bite harder as you progess.My first problem was the game would not return to the start if you selected the option screen, in fact it locked up completely meaning task manager required to get out, it does not do this every time therefore I did manage to actually play.Then any changes you make in options have to be reset every time you fire the game up, it does not remember your settings.The worst bug however is the sticking/jamming, not a problem at the lower levels as there are plenty of people to convert but as the difficulty rises the population dwindles quite dramatically & the number of snipers/grenadiers rises meaning you cannot afford to lose any of your little dudes by them getting hung up the map & becoming sniper bait.There is mention in a couple of the other reviews that you can jump but having pressed every key I still can't get them to do it, perhaps its a perk reserved for controllers only.Having spent over an hour trying to get past level 6 I finally give up. I know it can be done as I've seen it on You Tube but then the guy who did it gave up trying to complete level 7 before skipping it, I stopped watching at this time so perhaps he went back to it, I lost interest as he couldn't do 7 then there seemed no point in perservering with 6 only to get stuck on the next as well.Pros: It cost less than a £/$Lots of fun with plenty of humour at the lower levelsCons: The jamming / sticking problem is a real gamebreaker as far as I'm concernedThe background music is awful after a short time, the music on the menu screen is far better imo, although music is a personal taste so you may like it.Settings / controls are vague, I turn the music off at the start but as I progress the level rises again & has to be reset again & at the start of every game.Just because a game is cheap it does not mean that is an excuse to produce/release a buggy gameOne more observation, at time of writing, I checked the other reviews before writing this to see whether I was the only person having problems, I have more time in game & more in game achievements than any of the other reviewers, for so many positive reviews I wonder why so many of them have already stopped playing it.I don't believe people should be allowed to write a review whether positive or negative on any game when they have only played for a few minutes, it can be very misleading at times.If the devs were to refine the sticking or introduce more people into the maps people would have a better chance of progressing in what is in fact a potentially good fun game. 4.9/10To those of you who have completed the game""Respect"""

I understand that they're currently working on fixing a lot of them, but I just can't play it. It seems like a good concept for a game. Sorry Salty Sloth. I was gonna refund, but it's only $0.99 so  it's not really worth it. Hopefully they fix all the bugs soon."

Also the very low price of .99 cents was attractive as well.The game so far is fun. (I have a let's play video below of the first couple levels.) The game is not too difficult to understand. You go around converting innoncent people to tentacutes. There is some puzzles such as moving cars and trying to get around military.The humor is fun and makes the game a little more silly, which is what they are going for I believe.Some cons of the game are is that your fellow tentacutes will get separated or caught on something. It can become impossible to get straglers caught up. I wish there was a button to regroup together.But overall, this is a finished game unlike other indie games on here, where you pay 20 bucks for utter♥♥♥♥♥♥Great .99 cent game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVgMNtZLqs"

The HUD looks like a screenshot from word and there are only nine levels. I'm pretty sure there are only four tracks in the whole game, but I never finished it (due to the gameplay being boring). I would not at all recoment this game. (If they make a new one, one that has more levels, might be a good investment) I would love to see you getting to keep all of your minions, and take down bigger things, such as giant mecha robots. I would love to see this after another year of development and more funding."
