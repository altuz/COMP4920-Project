,Not Recommended,489460,32577498,Posted: 19 June,all,Meow Corp,"I've owned this game for about a year now, and while the little bit of content was fun at first, I spent only a couple hours playing the game. I expected some updates to the game but unfortunately very very few have come out. Not too much has changed from when I bought it. I've checked the social media of the dev's and there are literally no posts on what they're actually working on.Going through their game description, I've noticed that they have promised many things since the start that the dev's have shed little light upon. It seems as if the development is either non existant or very very slow.If you want to play the miniscule amount of content that this game has, go ahead, but I'm not betting on it going anywhere soon."

What if there was a weekly event where players compete to have their ship featured in the next weekly event so that would mean players would have to work on technic on defeating certain ship buildslike maybe a player takes down a slower ship because it was faster to maneuver attacks. and the only way take out that ship would be to build a ship made just for sniping off blocks that connect to propellers and Sails.and the DEV's could Have a monthly event to where they showcase an item you could win Like a Super Punks games Flagor building block if their ship is defeated within 3 stars.BUT. . . Overall This Game, Even in it's Alpha Build Is Fantastic And I would Recommend this to Everybody who loves Voyager games with a little bit of realistic Ship Physics.I give this Game A 9 out of 10!here is me playing the Last leviathan.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xui9c5cJMR0"

As it stands the early access provides you with everything you need to build ships and blow them up, which is a lot of fun. The only real downsides right now are that the game isnt very optimized (yet) and there is only a creative mode and a versus mode which lets you battle AI opponents. (There is also a event mode which is sort of a challenge mode) More gamemode however will come in the future. (campain for example). This title definitely seems promising and the developers seem very involved with the community. So if u like games like From the Depths and Besiege, The last Leviathan is worth taking a look at."

I have high prospects for this game given how enjoyable it already is in such an early development stage.That being said, there are a few suggestions I'd like to make for devs. (all of which are just my humble opinions)* Generally I feel it should be less windy/less wavy.  When it is very wavy it can be very annoying when trying to aim and it almost always is very wavy.* Make fog less foggy (currently feels over done and visibility is too minimal)* Allow players to pick up and move the steering wheel when ship building* Allow players to free roam in building mode rather than having the camera snapped on the steering wheel* Allow players to jump between cannons when in first person mode* Allow players to aim cannons to atleast a limited degree when not in first person mode* Allow players to rotate blocks diagonally to allow you to easily get the angle you desire on certain obtuse blocks without having to snap on at weird angles* Change cannonballs so that they deal reduced damage after passing through water rather than no damage at all* Increase the depth of the water in certain sections where a boat only two blocks in height bottoms out and can get stuck* Make an exception for text resolution when running the game on low res/fastest.  (I can't even read the text on said settings as it is too blurry (20x20 vision))* Fix the ability to delete blocks which are attached to others which therefore creates a floating block or object of any sort* Make sails more desireable for use and propellers less desireable to overly benefit the theme of the game (possibly reduce the effectiveness of propellers and make sails easier to navigate regardless of wind condition)*Make the telescope more useful than simply a tool for zooming in (possibly allow you to mark enemy ships so that they remain marked to you and your allies for set time)*Change the 3 barrel cannon so that it does not ever run out of ammo and instead increase its damage and allow it to 3 burst before reloading*Increase the distance mortars travel and decrease its damage output (currently travel distance is very minimal and you can often take out entire ships with a single shot if you manage to land one)*Fix the star system when doing class challenges.  (may have been fixed in 1.01?) Previously, if you were fighting a ship and got hit or killed then respawned, the other ship would still be damaged yet your star progress was resetLast but not least,Possibly create some sort of crew members to man the cannons and other aspects of the ship (captain, sails, etc)Again these are all just my suggestions, some of which I feel many players may agree and some of which they may not.Look forward to see the progression of this game as it makes its way through the stages of development."

This game is as if Besiege, Robocraft & From the Depths had a baby. I also am a fan for the sort of weird somewhat cartoony viking style art.

76561198073521758,Recommended,489460,23777255,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Mivran,"So far the gameplay has been straight forward, and the art design is eye candy. Plays very similarly to Beseige, though not nearly as fleshed out yet (2 days after release on Steam). I would recommend this to any fans of physics based gameplay with the caveat of this being an early access game."
,Recommended,489460,23869335,"Posted: 27 June, 2016",all,IllumiNate,"There's a lot to be said for this game while being an early access title. First off to summarize what aspects of the game are relatable to.In it's creative building it's similar to the user friendly block building sandbox games like Minecraft. If you can imagine it you can build it. Within reason at least. There is a limit to just how large you can make your ships. While I would like to see a larger build box it's also relatively unnecessary, because once you reach the wildship class most computers that are not high end can't properly run well enough to actually use the ship effectively. When you reach the point of having a Wildship the game does warn you to not go any further building for that reason. This is something some people would see as a con, but it's been addressed by the dev's that they are working to condense the memory usage of the game to allow low end computers the ability to effectively run the game.With that being said, you can spend hours and hours just messing around with the blocks and weapons and armor making small, but incredibly awesome ships to play with. You can upload your ships to the workshop or download other player's ships to pit against yours in battle against an AI. In the future they are adding the ability to actually battle another player controlled ship, but for now we have to remember this isa brand new early access and that kind of thing takes time. There's also going to be the option in the future to set out on a kind of story mode voyage and fight giant sea monsters and explore the world of Middenhir. There's plenty of other things to look forward to in the future beyond multiplayer 1v1 and exploring the high seas. The Battle Seas offers challenge mode objectives to earn rank stars for your ships. This includes survival mode battling waves of pirates, ship races, sieges, etc.All in all this game feels like it has a very bright future ahead of it. They are setting the bar high for future titles of the genre and will continue to raise it, by seeking to continuously make this game better. As we all know there are many sandbox games out there, but most don't compare to this early access game and how already well polished it is. Beyond the creative appeal and great potential this game harbors, the graphics are stunning and the water dynamics are probably some of the best I've seen.For 10$ I honestly don't think you can go wrong as this game will easily compare to any 60$ title at full release. The pro's vastly outweigh the con's, most of which are just glitches they needed players to test to find. You will 100% get your money's worth, which will also help to support the games growth. So if you enjoy pirate ships and sandbox games and are willing to help make a great title even better? Look no further. 10/10"

76561198070622005,Recommended,489460,29475154,Posted: 24 January,all,Exotic Butters,"I have no doubt that the reason Steam put this in my queue was because I spend so much time in Besiege. I think a lot of potential buyers are gonna come from there, so its a good a benchmark as any.The game has it's major strengths in its mechanics (building) and its graphical style. It looks like it does in the screen shots (typicall bloom-heavy indie style), which is more than can be said for most games. I like it, but you might not, and you can easily judge for yourself by scrolling up. As for building, its a little less intuitive than Besiege. The biggest issue I have is that I often find myself moving the camera slightly and accidentally teleport twelve lightyears away (often meaning every few minutes). I also would prefer if the bounding box weren't so small, or at least to have the capability of removing it in a freebuild mode. The default one is maybe 50% longer, wider, and taller than that of Besige's (going by block spaces, that is, so I think that totals about 40-ish).The controling of the vehicles is TLL's biggest shortcoming. With a game like Besiege, its not this difficult. Thats because wheel mechanics are a lot easier to think through. If your left wheels go forward and your right wheels go backwards, you turn right. Pretty easy stuff. Hydrodynamics are a bit trickier. For small crafts its not too difficult to manage, since you don't need to fiddle with ballast. For big ships however, I've never been able to make one that doesn't rock like its on a seasaw. This is an area where a short tutorial on the mechanics of large ships wouldn't go amiss.The variety of blocks is about the same from Besiege to here. For weapons its a little less diverse, and the developers of TLL seem to think that recoloring a weapon makes it ""upgraded"". I can only assume it's meant as an upgrade since it costs more.I'm a little displeased with the fact that sails hinder the craft so much when going into the wind. Friggates just aren't the same without sails, but sometimes the level is designed so that the ships have to go that way. Its sad that I'll never be finishing those levels then."

Tried out multiple ""build and battle"" type games and this one is by far offers the smoothest intro to the building mechanics. Obviously this is an early access, so I went into this game with zero expectations. The building was very straightforward and controls were reasonable. Graphics were very impressive given the scope so far and the gameplay is exactly what I've been looking for in a sim building game.My one gripe I have seen repeated in the comments around performance on non-beastly gaming rigs holds true. I'm running this from a fairly mid-range laptop. AMD A8 Quad Cord, 8 GB ram, factory video card....I can run Skyrim without any issues, so I didn't expect any major challenges. Unfortunatly the second I stopped bulding and starting traveling, frame rate tanked and it became very difficult to overlook.Overall, this is a quality game that even with the graphics issues I feel I got my money's worth. I love the premise and controls and am very excited to see more unveild as the game grows."

Its a bit like a water based version of beseige, except it needs more bugfixes. The handleing of ships is great. The whole base of the game has loads of potential, but it needs developing, and a lot of it. It is in very early acess just now, so if you want a complete game then don't buy it, but if you beleive that there is great potential in this, which i do, then get it, because they need money to develop it and it will become a great game.A few months later...The devs have added lots of features, done some fixes and are developing quite fast in general, teir marketing scheme with buying ports will work very well and best of luck for the game, it is now a good game and im sure it will become even better well worth buying."

I expect completing that gamemode will take a long time, but I think it's great because it gives me something to do while I wait for more stuff to be added.And with a $10 price tag at the moment I think it'll be a great investment, especially since the Devs say the price will increase as time goes on.

While the game now is simple, the developer seems very active in the community and seems intent on finishing his creation.The Last Leviathan is a ship-building sandbox game that resembles that of Besiege, only with large warships. As of now, it's a fairly simple game, but an enthralling one if you enjoy tinkering. It's a tinkering game.There is a sandbox mode, a versus mode and a sort of campiegn. The sandbox is just that. you create a ship of your liking, sail it around and check out these neat little island feature around the place. Versus mode is where you pit your ship against another one of yours OR someone else's form the community. What I like ot refer to as the campeign is a mode in which you are given a class of ship to build. Cog being the smallest, you start with that. Once you sink a certain number of various pirate ships, you earn stars which contribute to your ship's performance rating. Once you reach the right rating, you are allowed to move on to the next class. I enjoy it because it really drives innovation. New ships building off of others, advancing your maritime war effort and so on.Overall, I'd say it's a surprizingly left-field game that I will be enjoying for quite some time. And it seems it's only getting better~"

,Not Recommended,489460,24088085,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Goja,"As of right now, I can most accurately describe this as Besiege (Alpha version) with a pirate theme.I was interested in this game because I loved Besiege so I picked it up during the Summer sale, but oinly played it as you can see for about an hour before I got bored. Building ships is finnicky at best because of the controls. I would have much preferred the traditional WASD-to-pan-camera and Mouse3-to-rotate-camera controls than the mess of ctrl+(mouse button) layout that they have now. And one of my biggest gripes is that the key to copy a block (Mouse3) is the same as rotate the camera, so if you try to rotate the camera with your mouse hovering over your ship, you copy an unwanted block and you have to reselect the one you want. It happens more often than you think it would. The keys aren't even remappable yet. Yes, this is Early Access and was only released less than a month ago, but not having remappable keys is just bad.Also, there is no way to rotate a block along the Y axis that I have found yet. It is very confusing build system and I feel like the developers really need to take a step back and evaluate what needs fixing.The variety of building blocks isn't too bad for how long the game has been out, but I would like to see a content update in the near future with more weapons and different colored blocks. The ability to paint your ship with like a brush tool or something won't be terrible to add either, in fact I think it would add a whole new world of customization for the future Multiplayer gamemode.Now as for gamemodes themselves, there is basically two at the moment. Battle Seas and Versus. They're alright. Versus is againt AI which seems pretty good or it might be that I'm terrible, but it's good fun for when you lose internet connection and still want to play a game. Battle Seas is pretty great. I haven't gotten too far yet because I guess I'm bad but hopefully they'll add more stuff to it. They have said they will add racing to it which I will definitely be better at.Optimization. I have read a lot of reviews saying that it needs to be worked on but I have not experienced any problems myself. I have a fairly beefy computer (i5-6500 & GTX 970 (Slightly OC'd)) and I never experienced any issues especially when building huge ships.Final Verdict: It's alright. There is room to grow, but it's Early Access so that's expected. The only reason I do not recommend it currently is because of the god awful building controls. Like honestly, they're the worst I've used in my life."

,Recommended,489460,29904290,Posted: 13 February,all,Moggz,"In it's current state I'd give this a 6/10, pushing 7. I'd like to hope with future development it'll be finished and I'd rate it at least an 8/10.I enjoyed playing this, particular the ship creation aspect which seems to be the bulk of the game at this point. When I first started building I thought the selection of available blocks to build with seemed a bit limited, but actually I think the limited scope at this point helps encourage creativity somewhat. Some more weapons would be nice though. Also there's a concave style curved block, but after building a couple of ships I found I also wanted a convex curved block.At this stage in development, the funds for ship building are unlimited even in crusade mode. So with no idea what types of enemies I was going to face, I quickly ended up with a ship that was ridiculously overpowered and made the crusade mode very easy.I haven't worked out how to make torpedoes yet, and only just started playing about with ballast blocks (for submarines) and turning motor blocks, so there's still a bit for me to experiment with (I don't actually have 31hrs playing time, it was left on overnight by mistake).The sandbox mode is okay, but unfortunately you can only spawns random enemy ships of a specified class. I'd prefer to be able to spawn any ship I choose in this mode, including my own ships or workshop ships.The 'Versus' mode is good for one-on-one battles against an AI ship and can include workshop ships. However, in this mode you can only have one enemy. It would be nice to have multiple ships on each side of the combat.Finally, while it may sound odd, I'm not actually bothered about sailing and fighting with the ships. I'd actually prefer to build ships then pit them against each other with AI vs. AI so I can see how my ships compare, but currently this is not an option. The block-style destruction is satisfying.So, the game is building and destroying, both of which it is good at. I like the building, but I often miss the best bits of the destruction and there are no replays. I miss the best bits because in the heat of battle you're in first-person view. So I'm disappointed that I miss a lot of the destruction and can't watch it back either. Without a replay or AI-vs-AI feature with decent adjustable camera, I simply can't fully appreciate the fights themselves.It's easy to upload ships to the workshop and it's fun having a go with other users creations and seeing if you can defeat them with your own ships.So weirdly, I'd rate this game better if there was an option for less user input and more AI. I just want to build ships then watch them mutilate each other. The AI would need to improve a bit for this to work well too."

The enemy pirates and onshore enemies are good so far, the fish... well I'm assuming they'll be very different when this goes live.I stayed addicted to it as long as the available island chains stayed interesting, and if given some more content of the quality they have so far could be pretty good (if they flesh out the available systems with just more enemies to fight and islang chains to sail around in) or great if they go so far as to put in a ""trading around to different ports"" backbone, ala pirates.Also, it helps that it's gorgeous."

I gew into video games in the age of Sid Meier's ""Pirates!"" for the PC and Sega Genesis. Hours upon hours wasted playing that game to death (and I never did find all of my damned family members!).The Last Leviathan takes the battles from that game and puts you right in the driver's seat... and the architect's drafting table.The ships you can make, come straight out of your imagination, and there are some wild designs out there. You can go with the calssic Duth Fluyt, French Barque or Spanish Carrack or test your engineering with a more ""unique"" design.It blends the easy building of Beseiged with the naval action and physics of From the Depths. It's not perfect, but it's still fun if you like blowing stuff up!Pros:Easy building - point, click, rotate, place.Nice physics based modelingReal-time damage - blow pieces off, cripple ships, run then aground, capsize them, break them in half... you get the idea!

The Last Leviathan (TLL) is one such title that plagued my thoughts continuously.You’d be forgiven for thinking that TLL looks and plays rather similar to Besiege in its construction because on the surface it is essentially ‘Besiege on water’. Build a ship, test it out in the ocean, and refine your design repeatedly to improve buoyancy, weight distribution, and streamlining. Once that’s done, arm it to the teeth with an arsenal of cannons, mini-guns, and flame-throwers, voyage across the seven seas, and do glorious battle with enemy pirate ships. Or just ram them and sink them – it’s up to you really.Just like in Besiege, you can build pretty much anything that you can imagine using the tools available. You can even construct a completely overpowered vessel using the strongest materials, the best propulsion systems, and the most powerful weapons. However, should you take this ship on any in-game missions that are deemed to be below your creation’s class you’ll be warned that you won’t earn any mission points for having such an unfair advantage. The game determines a ship’s class by a fixed number of points. Each item you place on your ship (from decking to broadsides) cost points. The better the quality of the item (the stronger, more powerful, or more robust), the more points it will cost.This is a very effective mechanic that prevents you from building a ship that’s far too powerful for certain objectives. And so this forces you budget your point spending. Do you really want all those broadsides so you can unleash a hellish barrage of flaming shot at your enemies? Fine. But you’ll have to compromise the quality and strength of your hull making it more susceptible to incoming enemy fire. The same goes for items that provide stability, propulsion, and armour protection – everything in the building phase is a careful balance of point cost versus effectiveness. So in addition to knowing what makes a good ship you have to prioritise components according to your individual play style.However, unlike Besiege, TLL’s building options (at least at present) are much simpler. Aside from propellers there are no moving parts so you can’t create the mechanised marvels that feature heavily in Besiege’s screenshots and online videos.Think of the building system in TLL as Lego, and that of Besiege as Technical Lego.When it comes to engaging other ships in combat you can fight them either from a first or third-person perspective. A third-person view allows you to examine (and admire) the entire battle within its beautifully rendered environment; conversely, a first-person point of view allows you much greater aiming precision and makes the engagement feel a lot more visceral and personal. I think it’s marvellous that the developers have included both options, thus catering to both play style preferences and allowing players to focus on what they want to in a particular moment.Playing in third-person also allows you to zoom in and out using the mouse wheel. Again this gives you the option to choose to admire the sea vistas from a distance or get up close and personal in battle.After you’ve built a ship that stays afloat, and glides gracefully through the waters, combat then brings its own set of particular challenges. Hitting a moving target, as always, requires you to lead it accurately, the physics engine of the game means that you need to compensate for gravitational drop when aiming your shots, and the ocean waves rocking and buffeting your vessel mean that careful timing is necessary so that you fire when your cannons are aligned with your target.All of these factors can conspire to make combat somewhat tricky especially when you’re having to contend with rough seas. But when you do make successful shots against your target they are all the more satisfying for your having overcome each of these difficulties. The game certainly rewards patient and tactical players who are well versed in these mechanics.Sound effects aren’t usually something that grab my attention in a game, as a lot of them seem to be recycled from one title to the next, and/or feel disappointingly anaemic. TLL, however, has some brilliantly immersive sound effects already in place. The boom of cannons firing and the explosion of their shot impacting their target is deep, visceral, and very satisfying. Even the sound of a missed shot as the cannon ball merely plops into the ocean water is strangely gratifying too!Even with just 3 modes of gameplay (sandbox building, duelling against other ships, and battle seas: a scenario in which you fight against progressively more difficult enemies) TLL still represents good value for money in my book.PROS- The game requires good thought and planning to produce an effective sailing vessel that also fights well. But at the same time it’s also a very fun naval combat game for anyone whose willing to spend just a little bit of time learning the mechanics.- You can fight ship-to-ship combat either in third or first person, and it’s easy to switch back and forth between the two.- Great gunpowder bangs and cannon shot explosions really help to bring the devastating destruction of naval combat to life.- Fairly simple, yet beautiful and effective graphics pull you into a pirate-infested world of shimmering water and lush, green islands.- Very polished for an early access game.- Very stable for an early access title.- Steam Workshop support where you can download other people’s creations and pit your ships against them in a battle to the death.CONS- Performs very well, but still needs more optimisation.- Lacking a lot of content. But that’s understandable due to its very short time in early access.- That’s it really! Well worth the current asking price, with the content available, due to the sheer fun-factor.In Summary: Very Fun Shipbuilding and Naval Combat GameAs always, I’ll be updating this review when relevant, and leave questions below and I’ll get back to you.Until then, my ships will be eagerly waiting to sink yours in the Steam Workshop..."

You will find some boats are able to fly while others can skim across the water at mock 5. Hopefully they fix this. And that’s just the propulsions. Weapon issues include launching a torpedo and having it zoom in on a cannon completely losing control of where your torpedo is going with no way of gaining control since the cameras are both the same. Canons only fire in groups there’s no way to make them all fire at once or like besiege regulate the force or output. Also a ship automatically takes on water there is no water displacement making your ship look like a block of cheese or a floating cup of water. Battles with ships can sometimes cause them to break apart on there out without firing a single shot due too weak structures sometimes. They also lack range making it easy to pick off ships from far way with a dozen or so cannons quickly.ProsThis game does have a lot of perks and don’t get me wrong it does have problems but this is besiege with ships trust me. Unlike besiege it has 3 different rotating joints, boluses that help you create the perfect submarine and of course sails. It really inspires your inner creativity and has a little bit of a learning curve which is awesome. You’ll find a lot of exciting new ships until you make the perfect one and then you can face off with it and make one even better with versus mode sadly not online. The devs keep the community updated and informed a lot of work is gaining into this and I know there’s going to be incredible outcomes.DevsWhat you need to fix and some ideas on how to fix it.With the torpedoes locking on to the cannons I found out the camera buttons where the same for both. What I would suggest is either putting camera labels for both so it’s easier to change in editor mode or make it so you can switch back and forthWith limited gun editing you could allow the user to control what guns’ fire like you do with torpedoes making interesting gun patters and strengthsMovement is a problem with the game since sails almost hold no practical value against the wind they are useless and propellers are superior anywhere. Make them cheaper and stronger or propellers weaker. I’m really glad you added the realism but realistically propellers are op.Everything else seems to fit in place except for the: AI, Water displacement (You should really add this), Flying ships, more editing control, allow the user to move the steering wheel, and maybe put a zoom on the firing scope if the user has a telescope. Possibly add real monsters, marksman challenges, storms and darkness so we will have to use a light.Thank you for your time and consideration"

I see no point for that limitation. And if your saying it's for balance issues, thats just flat out ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. like if I have an entire wall of triple cannons, I control 1 and I can fire the entire wall at once. I understand This game is still early access and all, But you'd think most of the things I talk about would be fixed from the start. now another thing I add is, Why do messages pop up saying ""the kraken sleeps"" even though there are no krakens to be found in the game, I understand it's early access, but still, if there is no kraken, then why did you add ""the kraken sleeps""? I do recommend this game, just only get it when the game is complete, I got this game with the known issues. another thing is if you go below the purchase button and the ""DLC"" you can see the name a port and name in game button, and it's worth 99.98 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars? you gotta be ♥♥♥♥ing with me, the game doesn't even come with this ""bundle"" it's probaly some weird thing the devs are doing, but if you expect me to pay 100 dollars for DLC for a game that has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of problems, I'm out.

,Not Recommended,489460,33974525,Posted: 2 August,all,Tokoo,"Since this is in early access my opinion may change if released. This is one of the reason games really need to be monitored better by steam, and have set time frames for early access. This game hasn’t been in early access as long as others but still it’s been a year, and at the rate it is currently going this game will probably die before it actually gets out of early access. I think the last update was 4+ months ago, and all they have really done was add a bunch of DLC’s, useless one’s just to make money.The only reason this game, if you can call it that at this point is receiving positive reviews, is more or less due to the style, and concept which really is great, but that’s where it ends unfortunately.  Very little, to no content included, the majority of the game as of right now is making your ship’s, which is great, ton of stuff to customize your ships, and make anything you wish, but there is no PvP, and only 2 campaign chapters that feature 14 missions each give or take. So in total about 30+ missions, sounds like enough right, nope out of these 30+ missions there is only 4 different types of missions you rinse and repeat. Race mission, treasure hunt (which is the worst), Killing Waves Missions, and simply killing other ships, literally that is all you have to do atm.This game is basically in beta so yep there is a lot of bugs, and glitches, but that’s to be expected at this point. I highly would recommend to wait on buying this till it actually comes out and see if they do anything other than cash grab. They are promising a bunch of new upcoming content, but they have been doing that for a long time now, I doubt we see anything major till end of the year but we will have to wait and see.Pro’sThe concept is amazingThe GFX are really niceThe music fits – just can’t turn it downMaking ships – hands down the best thing about the gameCon’sNo content, and what they have is repetitive, and boringNo StoryNo leviathan – (You would think this would have been the first thing added since it is in the title)Overpriced and useless DLCNot much in the way of changing volumeUpdates are slow, and almost nonexistentLots of promises but no actionsNeutralLots of bugs, and glitches – Its beta, so this may or may not be fixed."

Emphasis on currently because updates are frequent enough and show no signs of stopping. :)To start, the only parts in the game currently is a fight against bots that are fairly clueless in waters that make it nearly impossible to use your weapons effectively. the combat between two ships that are about 10k to 20k are where the game has its strengths in that you arent flying around on waves but also arent crying you dont have a super computer (major optimization problems) after watching a few videos on youtube I decided to check it out and found it to be at such an early, barebones stage that it is not playable yet.I would love to see this game become optimized to fix the lag issues, I would love to see this game have competent AI's. I would love to see this game come to throughition with multiplayer. And I could go on and on about what I want this game to be but this is a review of what is here (so far). Which is why I had to give it the thumbs down becuase it is just not ready to be enjoyed for what it could be and you probobly wont get 10 bucks out of it just yet."

It already has many features that I've enjoyed (namely setting everything on fire), and it will likely be updated with many more options. I would like to address a few things, however. First, the building part feels slightly limited. It might just be me, but I am not able to rotate the blocks in mosomere than one axis. Secondly, the game runs fairly slow for me. I don't have the best graphics card, so that can be forgiven, but I would like to see some performance enhancements. Overall, awesome game with huge potential, and it's only in early access, so I am really excited to see what will be added later on."

The whole premise of this game was to go out on the high seas, build your ship and take on monsters. It has turned into a pvp game more than anything with a few land based cannons to fight.If you want to play with Lego ships against your friends then this game is okay, but the overworld which consists of small islands with nothing on them save for maybe a cannon or 2 and the occasional boat nearby is dull as dishwater.If you want to play a game like Beseige, go play Beseige. This is a shallow clone, and the one thing they could have done to differentiate (by having a proper campaign) they haven't.Listening to community feedback is great, and the devs have definitely done that. The problem is when you change the game to fit the communites ideas, you lose your vision you originally had.Thats what it seems like is happening here, it's all about showing off your wacky ""look at what I built"" ships. Go look at the community page and thats about 90% of it."

The physics are better and there don't seem to be any memory glitches. There is still plenty of potential for improvement but that tends to be true of all games.

(Creative ran 10x smoother)Help menu or ""Keys"" not to helpful. I couldn't figure out how to use some of its features. Like copy paste.I want to play this but with how graphically intense it is I won't be able to. The resolution options atm are very limited. Basically ran in windows 1280x720 with fastest graphics and with the smog in the event I wasn't able to play it faster than 5fps. I wish there was a select tool or something  to select a section and move all together as 1. Reason I say is because my first build didn't float as high as I wanted it to and since I built a hollow ship I had to start all over instead of being able to select the bottom half and lower it / fill in the gap. One easy solution for this is make the boat's wheel an item so you can place it anywhere.TL:DR Seems like a great game but you need a strong rig to play this. The fog in the game makes your FPS drop drastically and no settings to remove it."
