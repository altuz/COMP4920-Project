,Not Recommended,489470,23724446,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,KKMunky,Worst and laziest made HOG I've ever played. The objects are just the same items over and over on different backgrounds with little or no list variation. Waste of money at any price. I usually enjoy the Hide and Secret series but this is awful.
,Not Recommended,489470,29119690,Posted: 8 January,all,Bewbs :3,"Alright, I didn't finish this game, cause I really don't enjoy it. But I still think it’s fair to write a review about it of why I didn’t enjoy and didn't finished the game.First of all. Before I bought the game I was really excited to play it. I’m a big fan of hidden object games and I thought this was going to be one like all the others. This wasn’t the case though.When I saw that the story was told in comic style I thought, Well that’s a cool idea, never seen that before. The voice acting wasn’t the best, but not bothersome. Then the first hidden object scene came. It was just a background with a lot of random items on it. The object that I had to find where real random and it didn’t had anything to do with the story.After I finished the hidden object puzzle a new part of the story popped up in comic style and was going further with the story part where it ended. After the story part was finish I had to do a new hidden object scene. This was almost the same as the one before. Random background with almost the same items I had to find.This is how the game goes on and on. That’s why I decided to quite the game and why I won’t finish it. This is also why I won’t recommend this game. If you really want to try the game. Try to get it in the sale. Full price it’s totally not worth it in my eyes."

The game itself doesn't have a lot of the standard puzzle solving and walking around looking at things that a lot of HOGs do. It's simply cutscenes and hidden objects one after the other. The voice acting is a bit rough, but it's an inexpensive indie game, so that is to be expected. I think it was worth the $2 I paid for it."
,Not Recommended,489470,29098895,Posted: 7 January,all,Corwid,"Broken game. Does not proceed when I found all the items, stays on hidden object scene. Tried to quit to main menu and continue few times - item list dissapeared and I was clicking blindly. When I found all the items 3-4 times game continued to next HO scene and same problems happened again. No point to mention oudated graphics etc."
,Not Recommended,489470,31692205,Posted: 11 May,all,osirish,"A hidden object game that .... well, that's about it.This is a game that consists of hidden object scenes with a comic book storyline between the scenes. The scenes and objects have nothing to do with the story and vice-versa.The hidden object scenes themselves are lazy, and after a couple you discover that you are being asked to find the same objects over and over with just a background change.If you like HOGs for the story ... there isn't much of one. If you like HO scenes you'll find them extremely easy and basic. The story is just a link device between unrelated HO scenes.The game is incredibly short and beatable in less than an hour.About the only positive thing I have to say is that I didn't encounter any bugs.Not recommended unless you've picked it up for nothing and have 40 minutes to kill."
76561197971341065,Recommended,489470,25567477,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,sfnhltb,"Very basic hidden object game which skips all the point and click gameplay usually found in such games and reduces the game to a 3D cartoon cut scene followed by a HOG scene, repeat until the end (although late on you have to do two HOG scenes per cut scene). The story is fairly generic with maybe a couple of chuckles in places, but that is about it.So with it being so bare bones, pretty much the only thing that matters is the HOG scenes - which aren't great, the scenes and items don't relate to the plot at all (hardly unusual though), the item list is limited and most items will be present on each scene so you rapidly get used to what each named item looks like (with a very few exceptions where there are two variants possible), so once you have cleared a few scenes it gets very quick and easy.Still if you want a very basic HOG to run through quickly (probably half an hour or so? - ignore my time played, it was in the background unlocking trading cards while several other games were running), it is probably just good enough, especially when the price is next to nothing if picked up on sale."

I recommend it, but not for the full price, since the game is so old. Wait until it is on sale, or included in a bundle.The developers were obviously attempting to be silly, with the corny story line. I actually didn't mind the starving hero, ridiculous French villain, or the henchman who refers to himself in the third person.What bummed me out was the hidden object scenes themselves. The scenes consist of random objects stuck all over backgrounds that have nothing to do with the story line. Looking for a diving flipper? Why yes, there it is, affixed to the ceiling in what looks like an Egyptian temple... Makes perfect sense! Unfortunately, such hidden object scenes are pretty typical of the genre ten years ago. We've come a long way since then, thank goodness!Be glad that the game is relatively cheap (particularly when on sale), and it does go by quickly. Consider it a retro hidden object game."

Creators made use of popularity of genre to make easy money.Everything is wrong:- Stupid ""story""- Ugly comic- Random positioned hidden objects to search for, cut from some existing graphics- Lacking of good taste in every directionThis game is not worth even 50 cents"
,Not Recommended,489470,29103047,Posted: 7 January,all,bigwil335,"the worst hidden object game i have ever played. just a bunch of easy, lazy and repetitive hidden objects scenes that have nothing to do with the story.is it serious? i completed the game in 30 minutes. it is absolutely not worth the money.it is so bad that you will feel cheated even if you get it for free."

,Not Recommended,489470,31912625,Posted: 22 May,all,Momma Hanson,"The only reason I purchased this game is because 1. I had this game as a child on CD from a bargain bin and I loved it. 2. It was on sale.Unfortunately the game hasnt aged well. Its repetitive and you have to find the same things each round and the rounds dont pertain to the storyline which makes no sense in the first place. Anyways, for nostalgia's sake, I missed it. For playability? I dont miss it."

76561198096303338,Recommended,489470,24911345,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,verelstr,"Well, a low price for a medium-quality game. It's basically just cutscenes in cartoon style interspersed with HOGs. The HOGs are somewhat repetitive, same objects to be found and so on. You can breeze right through this game, it won't take you more than an hour. Characters are very cliche . All in all, nice time waster, but don't expect any quality."

76561198088061974,Recommended,489470,26364872,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,Darklord Lucifer,As a pretty good hog player i found this game way to easy and simple. Was done in an hour (not skiped any scenes or using hints).The resolution on the objects is a bit blurry sometimes but its playable.Many of the objects is found in every scene basicly which makes it kinda boring and the hidden object scenes and the story makes no sense when adding them together.buy it on sale if you collect those types of games. Do not buy it if u want a challenge becasue you will not get it here.

,Not Recommended,489470,29010849,Posted: 4 January,all,winchester.r28,"I found the levels of this game extremely repetative and easy. It has an interesting comic style layout for telling the story though, and the voice acting isn't too bad. I probably wouldnt recommend it to anyone who likes their hidden object games to have more challenging puzzles thrown in with the hidden object aspects, however if you happen to just enjoy the finding objects part of HOGs then I would recommend it."
76561197972117896,Not Recommended,489470,29279870,Posted: 15 January,all,fizzbin,"wow, I usually like HO games. This had a juvenile story and more of a comic book approach. The ""items"" and backgrounds were used over and over again. It was a half hour of repetition. Recommend only if you can get it for free or nearly so."
,Recommended,489470,29236231,Posted: 13 January,all,YPRPG,"This game doesn't deserve the bad reviews. It's a hidden object game, as described, without any added mini-games or point & click features. If you like hidden object games, then this game is for you. There is a comic strip style storyline throughout, which can be skipped over if it's not your cup of tea."
