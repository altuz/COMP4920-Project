Betadwarf has made two prior games, Forced and Forced Showdown. I have played extensivly Forced Showdown and had alot of fun with it. WIth that in mind I had very high hopes for betadwarfs third game, Minion Masters.Minion Masters is the PC-variant of Clash Royale were players aquire cards (minions, spells, buildings) and put togethor a deck of 8 cards and battle an random opponent. The goal is to lower the health of the opponents master by 3000 points.(V.S friend battle is in development).Tactics and counter knowledge is crucial to be a winner. All new players gets rubies, shards and gold because of the premium upgrade. Rubies are an purchable in-game currency (it is also rewarded by leveling up at certain levels and raise in leauge rank). Shards are also rewarded in the same regard as rubies, but are not purchable and can also be aquired if by spinning the power tower wheel (it is where you spend gold to get a random card). If you get a dublicate card, it is salvaged and you get shards in relation of that cards rarity.The game is still in beta and under heavy development and balancing. Some cards might be a bit OP. But players with OP cards that plays badly, looses very easily against opponents with common cards. Many people complain over others that have aquired the rarest cards in the game (Legendarys). But the first Master rank I know of (Master is the highest rank in game currently) only played common and rare cards wich are the two lowest card tiers except for regulars that are awarded during the initial level up process. WIth that said. Rare cards does not equal a better card. Tactic and the know-how to counter the opponents card is crucial.THe single-player campin consist of 3x5 battles I belive and is lack-luster at best. These servers more like a tutorial for the player to learn the game and level-up so that you can get most of the regual cards before you get to online-fightning and raise ones battle-rank. THis is a bit sad since I am a heavy single-player player.You get one Master at the beginning. Other Masters go through a free-roatiation system that you can play for free at those time. If you want to be sure to always play those Master you have to buy it with the in-game resources. A Master have diffrent attacks and also a perk system. By controlling bridges in the game you get XP that levels up the Master. Up to 4 Perks can be aquired where that fourth and last perk is always Mana frenzy.ALl in all I'm happy and surprised how much I enjoy this game. Updates comes regualary and new cards get added with it. New Masters are gonna be added soon. The devs are very communicative and listens to feed-back. Nerfing and buffing is gonna be frequent in teh early stages, but that is to be expected in an EA-game.Graphics 9/10GAmeplay 8/10FUn-factor 9/10(A tip to new players: Before you spend all your rubies and shards. Read forum and play a couple of battles and ask for tips. THat way you gonna know wich cards to craft and what tactic to use. This gonna reduce alot of frustrations early on before you can get most of the cards)"

,Recommended,489520,29979569,Posted: 17 February,all,DerpTaco,Minion MastersThis is a great game that is fun to play and even more fun to compete with mates. Its like the well known game Clash Royale but better. You get to choose from a wide variety of 'minions' and just have at your opponent. Attacks are great and fun to watch and the fact that at the moment the game is not pay to win is fantastic. Im really hoping the game doesnt turn into another pay to wingamelike most of the other purchases you can make on steam. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone with a pc and anyone with the ability to click a mouse buttonAussie Out!

,Recommended,489520,29471502,Posted: 24 January,all,ToxiGhost,"I'm really enjoying Minion Masters, it's a great 'filler game', what I call a game that's quick and easy to start up and play, but in depth enough that it takes a while to learn and master and playable while doing something else passively on the other screen =)Something I found really rewarding was in situations where I was on the ropes and defeat seemed imminent only to be able to pick myself back up, shout RAWRRR FER FREEDUM! and charge the enemy until victory was secured!It's a card based table top combat game where the goal is simple, destroy the enemy base and defend your own. It's simple, challenging, rewarding and enjoyable. However i'd be lying if I said the game blew me away. It didn't bring any new concepts to the genre and I would like to see some map variety.With that being said though, what this game does, it does well. It delivers an enjoyable real time, card based combat experience with enough variety, content and initial support to keep you interested for several hours, and for 20 euros you can't go wrong if you enjoy intense PvP.Pros:-Animations are gory and fun-Graphics are clean and simple, but not too simple-Card variety and deck building is satisfying-Match-making seems very fast and puts you against equally skilled opponents-Heroes are well balanced-PvP matches have no chat ability so no player toxicity is possible. (There are smilies though!)-No problems with performance at allCons:-Perhaps a little expensive for the simple premise of the game.-Only 1 map design-Only 1v1 matches (would be good to see 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 matches at some point)-Deck building is a little simplifiedOverall i'd rate Minion Masters an 8/10 - Really fun and definately recommended to those that enjoy competitive PvP matches and/or card/deck based games."

,Recommended,489520,31722210,Posted: 13 May,all,Ciunay_Ragathol,"One of the best free-to-play games that i ever played. Much fun.I was following this game since EA launch, but now i regret i didn't buy it before.Looks like a perfect mix between MOBA, TCG and RTS genres, where your hero is your base (every hero has a unique style) with abilities that you unlock by exping during the match, and your cards are your minions; they differ in attack speed, HP, movement speed, attack range, abilities, stealth, flying or non-flying minions. You are free to unleash them everywhere on your side, but not on the enemy side; choosing good counters against the enemy minions is very important and positioning is important as well. The bridges of the arenas are two control points that generate exp over time.I find that this game is well done under all aspects: good gameplay, humor and quality.Is it Pay-to-Win? NO, NO, and NO. Just play.Golds are earned by playing and used to open chests, and materials are used to craft cards or to buy heroes. You can salvage unused cards to earn more materials.Also, there is a classic hero rotation and a free chest containing golds or materials (not cards) is granted everyday."

,Recommended,489520,33370444,Posted: 8 July,all,Tixola,"First and foremost, this game is not pay to win. Obviously, if you do pay then you can get things quicker, but it doesn't really have any major influence on winning or not. I have been using a combination of cards that is mostly made up of the ones that I started the game with and have won more than I have lost. With regular playing and completing the challenges, you can build up a good deck and save shards and rubies to open up new characters and arenas. Obvously, if you are impatient and want to get everything immediately, then paying for the premium upgrade will help you to unlock all the main masters and some arenas. Some grinding will always be present in games where there are unlockables.A lot of people have made the comment that the game is dependent on luck, which I don't think is entirely true - tactics can win the game. Spamming low cost cards will sometimes work, but carefully using the deck will get around this. If you don't invest time in the game, then it will feel superficial. Give it some time, try out new masters and card combinations until you find soemthng that works and then go with that.The graphics are great, the animation is smooth and the community isn't full of people shouting obscenitites at each other. Gameplay is well paced and balanced - but it does take time to master.An excellent game that I look forward to seeing grow. Highly recommended."

,Not Recommended,489520,31846517,Posted: 19 May,all,Captain Morgan,"As much as I wanted to like this game, in its current state I feel it's just not worth a recommendation.Don't get me wrong, there are definitely some highlights and this game has more than enough potential, but the devs will have to actually bring it to that point first.Obviously, with this game being an Early Access game means it's not complete. I accept that. Recently I was a bit discouraged when I ran across a bug and then found it has been reported 6 months ago, with a dev response stating they weren't planning on fixing. Rather, they sort of just accepted it as an unusual mechanic in the game. Since this game only offers competitive queues, thus pushing a competitive agenda for the game, I find it hard to support it given the dev's take on bugs.Any bug, big or small, should eventually be addressed in order for a competitive game to be taken seriously. Due to the nature of competitive games, there needs to be balance, and game mechanics need to be as solid as possible. Imagine if some of the top competitive games on the market today had devs that left clear and reported bugs untouched and wanted players to just play around it.Anyway, I suppose my biggest issue just seems to be with the devs and how I feel they have been and will handle the game. It makes me worry about longevity."

,Recommended,489520,33907816,Posted: 30 July,all,Terroriza,"Amazing game, must play. Simple to pick up, hard to master. You can seriously compete without spending any money. Many great strong decks that do not include legendary or even supreme cards. Really great community as well. The game is not perfect needs some more balance updates. They are making new content and modes which is nice, but just have to make sure they don't ignore current issues. You wouldn't think this game was in EA, it feels 100% completed..You gotta ignore a lot of these negative reviews. I have personally read many of them and most of them are from people who simply do not understand how the game works or they are just insanely impatient. You can easily obtain a collection for free without any real issues. You get on overage 2k+ gold per quest which is enough to purchase 2 cards and you get 1 quest per day. In 1 week time of playing about 1 or 2 hours a day you will have 14+ cards from quest and another 3/4+ or so from playing, it will depend on how much you win for the ones you get from playing.I've ranked up pretty high (Master / Grandmaster) with only using the most basic cards. No supreme, no legendary, 1 or 2 rares and that's it. I'm not really that wild about the legendary cards for the most part, they are kind of specific and good for certain things, but not really all around type cards.The only negative would be the masters could take a little while to unlock. 2 are on a weekly rotation and fairly soon you will earn enough to purchase 1 more. Just like any other f2p game if you don't want to spend ANY money at all then you better damn well expect to spend a fair amount of time to earn them. Why does everyone always want everything for free all the time instantly as if we live in a fairytale world?If you want things unlocked sooner then spend 20$ and get a MASSIVE jump start to the game. You can legit spend only 20$ and have a ton of stuff unlocked in a short amount of time. You get 2500 rubies which can purchase SEVERAL masters plus double gold and xp for 1 year. This game is note even remotely close to being considered p2w because of the extremely low amount of money you would need to spend to instantly unlock everything. I'm talking about unlocking basically everything from day 1 without even playing the game, it wouldn't cost that much at all. You can definitely just spend 20$ and with a reasonable amount of time have most of the cards you want with almost all the masters.The development team is really impressive and active. This is the first game i've seen where the devlopers are constantly active in the streams and not just the ones with the most people. I was starting off streaming and nobody is there except 1 of the developers. They are active on forums and take lots of input to balance changes and ideas. I've also met lots of friendly players who I play with regularly.This is really nice, especially with how a lot of games have greedy developers putting games behind unrealistic paywalls or cancerous communites. I've only seen about 2 or 3 people who are pure cancer and 10 times that of good friendly players. You can also get this game for free just from watching streams, they give out steam keys often."

I've made it to mid Platin with a deck consisting out of only basic and a single common (green) card which is accessable to anybody who played for 20 minutes.Here's the deck (might be outdated when you read this)http://steamcommunity.com/app/489520/discussions/0/1354868867706847916/(Also - as you can see in the first screenshot - the top 2 decks consist of 8 basic cards)Variety:A lot of people at lower ranks complain about about low variety - resulting from bad players tendency to copy the same, expensive top player deck and wasting all their resources on something they don't need. At higher ranks however variety increases a lot. From gold rank onwards - and especially within the top 20 - the meta is incredibly fluent with everybody tweaking their decks against each other.Summary:This game deserves a lot more positive attention than it gets, it's simply that a lot of people see that this game's underlying concept is Clash Royale and judge a book by its cover instead of reading a few pages first. This game has a lot more strategic layers than other games under its seemingly easy surface and skill is getting rewarded incredibly well.Also notice that while the recent reviews are mixed (because they had server trouble and a delayed patch ONCE in a year...) the game still has  2867/3507 positive reviews which equal a 81,75% positive review rate."

It seems simple at first, you have a few cards in your deck, 4 of them in your hand all the time, you continously acquire mana which you spend to place them somewhere in the battlefield, then most of them start walking towards the enemy and they fight whatever they meet on the way.It's simplicity is deceptive, to be really effective one needs to know many things and make good decisions quick. At heart it's a game of countering as the trailer suggests, but to effectively counter you need to know the cards in the game well. On the surface it might seem enough to know which card is able to damage which, but in reality their placement and even the timing of casting them matter a lot, sometimes an effective counter is nullified just by placing it half a second earlier then you should place them. Of course it matters what cards you have in your deck as they can be built for synergy and also variety to be able to counter whatever comes your way, but in my limited experience how you play them is more important.It's one of the better examples of the easy to play, hard to master concept and a lot of fun for a game that you can play using just a mouse in a minute or two."

Sure, it is gonna be f2p.  But the want to spend money will probably be strong.  Why?  Because it is fun as hell!,and:-the earning of ingame currency to craft new cards and buy new masters is a tad slow ( I have 100% bonus for a year from premium account, that helps.)Good game.

Because the game is still in early access they obiviously focus on introducing more content which is fine, but the game is really unbalanced at the moment and there is no change in sight. Either the devs just completely neglect the testing or just have no clue how to properly balance a game like this.Nonetheless if you enjoy playing against the same 2 or 3 decktypes most of the time and just mindlessly rush your opponent down with ""aggro"" cards you most certainly will enjoy this game."

I hope they continue to add to it over time as I love games that give agency through a selection of units.  Beta Dwarf really knows how to strike a nice balance in visuals and depth, giving their games a very distinct feel.One thing you're going to see throughout all the reviews so far are that people really enjoy this game, despite not liking the payment system.  I wouldn't let complaints over the purchase model sway you away from trying it, though.  It's something easily changed and I'm sure they're taking that feedback seriously.My suggestions would be:- Persistent elements of some kind.  Either per-player or even with the cards in their collection, still waiting for a game to go down that path and this seems like a great place for it to happen!- Clean up the UI when not in a game, having my arena is okay, but it feels cluttered at times.- Add polished transitions between UI-mode and actual game mode.- Add multiplayer modes where I can play with a specific friend, not just random matchmaking.- Add different types of and larger maps.  Not just the two-bridge design.- Clearly this game would be awesome on Android and iOS!- Address peoples' concerns over the pricing model. I'd hate for all these negative reviews to sabotage this title as I would like to continue playing it!Again, these suggestions take what is clearly a solid concept for a game and would make it twice as compelling."

,Not Recommended,489520,31222548,Posted: 18 April,all,Arrevax,"TL;DR: The gameplay gets boring and same-y; you could play half a dozen matches and essentially get the feeling of every match you'll ever play. The card system is just a grind for the current best cards. Current ""best"" decks make competitive play a boring, stagnant mess based on RNG because the game requires very little skill.The gameplay itself isn't bad, but it's shallow. The game boils down to picking a card to play and playing it on a location.There are spells and minions. Minions can be flyers (making them invulnerable to ground melee units), buildings (meaning they're stationary and lose health over time), or building-focused (they ignore other minions except buildings). Spells are all variations on temporarily or permanently removing minions from play; some require basic MOBA-style targeting skills to use effectively.Masters are the avatars you can choose to play as. Each has its own attack style (for defending itself when minions reach your end of the board) and special abilities (cards that are mixed into your deck, or passives) that are unlocked with in-match experience.The board itself has two bridges (which give experience to the master of the last minion that walked/flew over them), a gap in the middle that flying units can bypass.Each minion has its own quirks in addition to basic types (flying or not, etc.), but it feels like some are far more viable than others. This is given evidence by the dominance of successful builds used by top players— leaderboards can be dominated by a single deck until a new patch arrives. Which leads me to my next point...Deckbuilding is the only thing giving this game any longevity besides its competitive leaderboards (which can be meaningless due to the current dominant deck). You earn pitiful amounts of gold by winning matches, significant amounts by doing daily quests (ex: win X times), and pitiful amounts of shards (card crafting ""dust"") by gaining more than 3 copies of any card. As far as I'm aware, the third resource, rubies, is limited to a few handouts that every player will quickly receive via achievements (ex: reach X competitive tier). Gold is used to buy tokens for a single random card, massive amounts of shards can be spent on new masters, boards (just graphic changes to your side of the board), and cards, rubies are used for masters and boards.PVE is just a set of matches against bots. You receive set rewards for beating each bot match once. This was a major disappointment to me— I enjoyed the randomization and depth of Forced Showdown."

76561198041553585,Recommended,489520,29236615,Posted: 13 January,all,roslolian,"This game is basically Clash Royale with hero avatars, so a bit like Clash Royale meets HearthStone I guess. It plays a lot like Clash Royale but there are two bridges in the game you need to control, the longer you have them under your control the more exp you get which enables your hero to do get some skills. IMHO it's a vast improvement over the Clash Royale game because each hero you has a a distinct playstyle, this leads to a lot of varieities in decks you play against. One thing I don't like though is deck slots are locked till lvl 20, it's a pain to make decks or search for the card you want.I find the business model to be both fair and a bit unsatisfying. On one hand you get a pack a day, there is dust to craft cards you need and there is a ""free rotation"" on heroes. On the other hand though, the ""pack"" is really just one card so buying power stones isn't that satisfying, once you have a decent collection good luck getting new cards as you will just get duplicates which will get dusted. I bought 10 power stones and got dust and a crappy card.  Another thing is you still need to buy heroes separately, of course you can also grind for it using freemium currency but this game isn't exactly free to play so why are we paying more stuff for heroes? If this is the business model then just make it F2P outright, they have a promotion giving out free steam keys for people following their newsletter which essentially makes this game free, but for the average Steam player who has no idea there's such a thing he'll be paying for the game, and then pay for it again in micro transactions. At least right now though paying $13 gives you the Premium upgrade for free so you're getting something for your money and players who didn't get a free steam key don't feel like they got ripped off.Even with these gripes though the game is still pretty good and addicting, I find it to be much improved version of Clash Royale both in mechanics and business model. I highly recommend it."

,Not Recommended,489520,29405110,Posted: 21 January,all,cafeaulait,"Minion Masters - Forced to Duel-> more like ""Forced to Pay""The good:- very nice and polished look- cool unitsThe bad:- unbalanced- tries too hard to be different- some bad mechanics- greedy pay model- huge grindI wish they would have stuck to the good old card game formula we all know with this one. The polished look is something I find missing in most other card games out there and I would be so hooked on this if it was just like any other card game - turn based and without a battlefield that units move around on.However they tried too hard to make something different. Nothing feels natural, the slowly regenerating mana bar, the two bridge set up that allows whoever holds them to gain abilities for their hero unit, the placing of units on the battlefield. It feels like a bunch of different mechanics thrown together without them really fitting together.My biggest gripe with the game is how hectic is and that you can't control your units. The unit ai is pretty dumb, often you will see your units stuck on an enemy they hardly deal damage to while another enemy they could have easily defeated picks them off one by one. The developer says this is a game mechanic that the players need to learn but to me it was nothing but frustrating and didn't add anything to the strategic layer of the game. Talk about strategic, I think the developer tried to make it count where and when you place your minions and to a degree it works but the game is just too hectic and the battle fields are too small for this to really work. For example your units can be attacked by the enemy while they are still spawning, so you are forced to think about where to place your minions. The problem is that the battlefield is just way to small for this, which makes enemy minions reach your hero too fast and gives you too little room and time to properly do attack routes for your minions.And don't get me started on the pay model. It's insanely greedy. You earn between 5 and 30 gold pieces per match depending on if you win or not. It takes 1000 gold to roll for another card. You will often roll a card you already got multiple times. There are several currencies, shards, gold, candies... experienced f2p game players will know this is all to make you pay for the game. I think we all know these kind of ""free to play"" games by now that are addicting but only enjoyable if you pay. I don't think I really need to explain this further, it's not f2p done right.Over all I can't recommend this game. The developer tries to bring in new strategic layers to the existing card game formula but at the same time takes away on the strategy part by not giving you control over your units and basically turning the game into a hectic clickfest that is normally decided by how lucky your card draw is."

You can complete all the PvE challenges and reach the Silver PvP rankings relatively quickly. However, once you reach the Silver level, you will go back and forth between Silver and Bronze for quite awhile. The reasons for this are systemic. The cards you recieve as a reward are random and the difference in power level, mana cost, and usefulness vary wildly between rarity levels (common, regular, rare, legendary, and supreme). For this reason, those who subscribe to the pay to win game style (at the cost of other players' fun) or those who have been playing the game enough to accumulate a quality card collection quickly begin to dominate the game, countered only by bad luck in their randomized draws during individual matches. This turns the game into yet another one of those skinner box games that eschews interesting gameplay as it's primary mechanism for engaging and retaining its player base.Tl;drThis is skinner box game that is fun for a day, so long as you bought it on sale, but beware of getting sucked into grinding just to be competitive."

,Recommended,489520,34055691,Posted: 6 August,all,Euphytose,"An excellent PvP game you should really check out. There are very good reviews already, but seeing as the game is rated as ""mostly positive"", I felt like adding my 2 cents, because it deserves much more.Pros:- Very quick battles, often over in under 5 minutes.- Good card variety (95 cards as of the writing of this review) allowing for different strategies.- Your deck consists of 10 cards, and your hand of 4. This means you can quickly cycle your deck, and the game revolves a lot more around skill than luck of the draw, like other card games.- Next to no RNG. Some cards are pure RNG, but they're a gamble you chose to take. The only RNG that's forced on you is the initial hand and draw. Some decks rely on a single card that you buff / heal, if you don't draw this card first, this can be a problem. However, this is also a risk you chose to take. You can make a versatile deck that has an answer for almost everything, so any draw can be useful with those.- Looks great, and sounds nice.- Draft mode and 2v2 if 1v1 isn't your thing, this means you can play with a buddy.- You can customize your arena, and master skins are coming.-Not pay-to-win, this is a very important point. Many reviews claim that this game is pay-to-win, but top tier players can reach top 1-5 with almost only basic cards.- The devs are open to criticism and listen to the community. This doesn't mean you will agree with everything (especially some balance changes), but they read the forums, fix the bugs that are reported, and add options based on feedback.Cons:- You need a good computer to be able to run it on max settings.- Small playerbase, this means you will see the same people very often. This is a bad thing for some people, a good thing for others.- 95 different cards can also be a con for a new player, since you can feel overwhelmed until you know which card does what."

You can unlock anything through playing that you could buy, and I don't mean you have to grind 1000 hours to get them either, it is very reasonable when it comes to the microtransactions. The game places you in matches with similar level players so that no matter what, you're going to have a good time playing and not have to worry about someone ages ahead of you completely wrecking your life.

Rarity systems prevents you from getting the useful cards.The other daily thing, this free spin only gives you small amounts of money, rubies or mana. You have to spin every day for 15 days to get 1 card.Also you can use like 3 times the same card in your deck. So disenchanting your exess cards will not happen until very late.  If i get a card one time, why can' i simply put it in 3 times in a deck? Because they want to sell me cards would be the answer.In the beginning it draws you in with new cards every 3 matches.Then it stops, even with premium upgrade it becomes a boring grind with losing a lot of times.Why losing a lot of times?
