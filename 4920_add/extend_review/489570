,Recommended,489570,33719941,Posted: 22 July,all,[PHE$] $exyClover,It needs more players. Can't find a match. Noone wants to play with me :((((((
,Not Recommended,489570,33620231,Posted: 17 July,all,.Frost.,"This is a cool concept for a game, but as of right now it has no player base (so no online matches = no game). The Keyboard and mouse work now after a quick patch from the Dev, but sadly still no online matches available.I would recommend waiting for the playerbase to expand, before purchasing. But if you are keen to support this game and hopefully increase the playerbase, then please buy it.Until the larger player base arrives, this game will stay at 2 out of 5 Beers from me.Cheers,FrostEdit Note: I have edited this due to the fast response from the Dev for fixing the controls, but sadly the game is largely dead, unless you have players on it. I hope for everyones sake, that the numbers increase. Perhaps a free weekend or a discount would help."

It feels buggy and delayed any actions! You cant pvp properly. Impossible to competitive playing. Really frustrating a the moment but hope its a game with a good potential.

At first I felt like I was never going to be able to feel lika I have control but after some games it came naturally. I've played 30 or so games and the ones that are th most fun are the ones where you meet someone that has played the game for some time too, then it gets faster and more skill based. The game still have it's fair share of bugs but me personally didn't encounter any gamebraking ones all.Fun indie title, I'm recommend it strongly but it's a very small playerbase right now so it sometimes takes a while to get games."
,Recommended,489570,33557658,Posted: 15 July,all,Angurz,"Antispehere is a skill-based competitive twin-stick shooter in which you go against 1 opponent with an addictive ranked system very similar to Hearthstone. My only issue is that the tutorials don't really give you an idea of the game and the best way to learn is to play casual mode. The playerbase is currently very small, although to be fair the game came out not even 24 hours ago from when this review is posted.If you've ever played Lethal League then this game is quite similar in that you interact with the ball to eliminate the other player. The only difference is that instead of picking a character with set qualities, your ""sphere"" is customisable in appearance and in abilities. You can use these abilities to manipulate the ball and the opponent to eliminate them.The game is very pleasing to look at and has a good enough soundtrack to not annoy you but won't stand out particularly either.This game could absolutely shine with a larger playerbase. This would motivate the devs to put a lot more into this game and make it stand out as a very unique competitive experience. At it's current price it is absolutely worth it. I recommend using a controller!"
,Recommended,489570,33544419,Posted: 14 July,all,Kreepy Kooldude65,Not played for too long but what iv'e played i've enjoyed. the game is fast paced and keeps you on your toes to what your openent might do next and what maneuvers you may have to do to avoid their different attacks. the music is energetic that of wich i quite liked. the time trial modes are a nice addition to test your skills and to help train you for online. The only downside i have at the moment is the connection. either the servers or the fact that i was being connected to people a distance away from me. this made the online not as enjoyable as it should have been.  sometimes teleporting (without using the ability) shots connecting when they shouldnt have on both ends and shots not connecting when they should have. Overall its fun. would be great at partys or if you have a friend over.

,Recommended,489570,33571841,Posted: 15 July,all,Terminal,"As of patch 1.0.1 all the issues listed below have been fixed and the game is completely playable. It's actually a lot of fun, and I seriously recommend it. I wish there were more people playing the multiplayer as right now it's impossible to find a game, but the gameplay shown in the challenges and tutorials is fluid and fast.--------------OLD REVIEW:Not really much to say here that I haven't already said in mylivestream (40 minutes long)(or theedited version (15 minutes long)).That said, I'll summarise the problems I had (as of release day).The controls are incredibly unresponsive (on keyboard, didn't test a controller). Several tutorial levels are near impossible to start, and the end screen upon completion of a tutorial level does not close upon pressing space like the game says, forcing you to ALT+F4 out of it.The loadout screen is fairly unintuitive in terms of how to close it, you need to close any active menus before you can back out which isn't obvious at first. Also, the game doesn't tell you that right click closes any active menus.As a minor complaint, the mouse sensitivity settings don't seem to change much (if anything) and the rotation feels way too sensitive to me as I usually play games with a fairly low sensitivity, leading to a lot of over rotates.With all of these control issues, I can't recommend the game in its current state. It has an interesting premise, and the match I played was fun, but the inability to close menus hits even after playing a match; you have to ALT+F4 and relaunch the game after every match you play.It's entirely possible I'm part of a minority with these issues, and it's entirely possible these issues don't exist on a controller, but reading the other reviews for this game only emphasises the point that something is currently broken control wise, for both keyboards AND controllers alike.When these problems get fixed, I'll come back to the game and give it another look. If they have been fixed then this review will be positive (unless a new major issue rears it's head, but that's unlikely).If the premise of the game interests you and you don't mind buying into a product that has a chance of barely functioning, then pick this game up. Otherwise, wait a few weeks for some patches to roll out and for the game breaking issues mentioned here to be fixed (which the dev's have informed me they are looking into)."

,Recommended,489570,33543682,Posted: 14 July,all,Ravioli Formuoli,"Edit 2: This game now works on my PC after a hotfix released one day after the game's launch. The stuff below is no longer applicable to my review. Thank you for a fast fix, devs! So far I'm really enjoying the game, and will update the review again once I have a more developed opinion.Edit: I should have prefaced this before in this review - This is only about my experience with the game. I've seen plenty of people who are able to play and enjoy the game just fine, and only a few others who are experiencing issues similar to mine. Either way, I cannot play due to a game-breaking bug with no currently working fixes, and I view this as a major issue.Simply put, the game does not work for me. The menus are fine, the music is pretty good, the concept of the game is interesting, but the game itself does not work at all.As soon as I try to enter the game, neither keyboard + mouse nor my Xbox 360 controller works to play the game, which are both the recommended control types for playing. I cannot move my ship whatsoever in local VS mode, and I cannot progress past textboxes while in-game. I have tried pressing every single key and button to see if some sort of interaction button has a strange default bind that isn't acknowledged in the controls menu, but nothing works.The game also enters a fully softlocked state for me whenever I enter the game, as trying to exit out to the main menu triggers the menu music and a loading icon to appear, but nothing else happens. Oddly enough, you can pause again in this state despite the game being paused already, and I cannot select any of the options in the glitched pause menu that appears if you pause while exiting to the main menu.I want to like this game, but it's very hard to do so when the only part of it that works is the menu."

The tutorial was a bit tedious, I would prefer to jump into games immediately and be able to learn as I play with new concepts being introduced organically.Good graphics and music, very polished title. Absolutely worth the money."
