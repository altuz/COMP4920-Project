If only just 1 on 1. I know, it sucks, but it really does!Playing this beautiful game and knowing you cannot really play live with an opponent is like receiving the best grilled turkey in the world but: you can't really eat it.If there would be a good live 1 on 1 multiplayer I'm sure this game will get a group of fans that just will never stop playing this."
76561198139367442,Recommended,489600,26419679,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,turnerm05,"According to Steam I've spent 11 hours with the game so and I think I've gotten a good enough feel for the game to post my (still early) thoughts.First of all - this game is fantastic.  In general, I'm blown away by how well it is done even in it's very early state.  As best I can tell, there's no detail that the dev team hasn't already thought about and most of these are already implemented into the game.  I think this is a game change and it fills a void for sim lovers who either don't have the space or the desire to do a full simulator setup.  Unfortunately this has likely ruined 2D golf for me.  I'm sure I'll still play 2D titles but this has far exceeded my expectations.The game was just recently updated to include ""sticky clubs"" so that you no longer have to hold the trigger in order to hold the club in your hand.  So my thoughts below will be based on this new update since it has improved several things that were causing me some minor issues before.Graphically - I guess it's better than expected given all the warnings I received about how VR graphics aren't great at the moment.  I think there's still some optimization to do but the fact that it's so immersive kinda overcomes any shortfalls on graphical fidelity.  This isn't an HBS issue though - it's more of the current state of this newer technology.Immersion - this is where it's at with this game.  I can't say enough great things about it.  From the watch (which tells you the direction to the pin, wind direction, distance to the pin, stroke count, etc) to the course map in your back pocket to the golf bag it's just SO immersive.  A few cool things here:1 - stepping over to your bag to grab your club is awesome.  There's just something cool about this that never gets old.2 - when you find yourself at the bottom of a hill and you need to see what's up ahead so you can plan your shot, you just teleport ahead (or walk if it's a short enough distance) and take a look around.  Pick out a reference point in the distance as your aiming point, go back to your ball and take your shot.  Very realistic and very well implemented.3 - hills, slopes, etc all work as expected.  If the ball is above my feet I have to adjust my swing both in terms of aim and in terms of club length.4 - overall depth perception and changes in elevation are great.5 - reaching into your bag for a ball when you need to take a drop.  Awesome.  They could've just made this a menu item but I'm glad they went the route that they did.6 - gridless putting is WAY better than you'd think and better than anything in TGC or JNPG.  More on this later.The swing.  The bad news on the swing is that it DOES require some adjustment from your normal real life golf swing.  I'm 98% certain that this is due to the total lack of weight (and proper distribution of weight in particular) when using the controller as your ""club.""  If you've played a lot of golf in real life then it will be an adjustment.  For some it seems to be a pretty wild adjustment and for others not so much.  If you don't play much real life golf then it probably won't matter.  I will say that with the latest update where you are no longer required to hold the trigger to hold your club, it makes for a MUCH more natural swing and has alleviated most of my issues with the swing interface.  Prior to this update I had to address the ball with a massively closed club face in order to ensure that my club face was square on impact.  Now I do not have to do this.  I also had to address the ball with the ball lined up on the toe of the club in order to hit it in the center of the club on my downswing.  This is no longer required.  I think now that I can hold the controller with a normal golf grip things are falling more into line with my normal swing.The act of swinging the club in this game is fantastic!!  Just like in real life I know when I hit a bad shot without even looking at the result.  And just like in real life I have to concentrate to execute a good shot.  I've also learned that, just like in real life, if I take a practice swing (even a shortened version to ensure that my takeaway motion and follow through motions are clean) that I have much better success.  In other words - this is NOT some hokey arcade VR swing.  It's a true swing and it tracks VERY accurately.There is no shot shaper.  You ARE the shot shaper and it works wonderfully.  I can hit any sort of shot that I can hit in real life.Short game - awesome.  Can't say enough good things here.  From off the green I can use my 7 iron to hit a bump and run or I can use my lob wedge or sand wedge to chip the ball.  On Casual mode (next to easiest difficulty) there is a power boost that's built into the game (this reduces in amateur mode and it goes away all together on Pro mode) and it will be obvious if you try to bump and run with a 7 iron.  But the mechanics are there and it's done VERY well.  The only issue currently is that there is too much spin on the lob wedge.  They know this and are fixing it.  But I can either close the face down a bit and hit a sharp little pitch at the pin or I can open up the face a bit and hit a loftier shot that carries further but bites harder.Putting - awesome.  I think they have NAILED putting.  It can feel odd to putt with little to no weight and this can also cause your club head to move around a bit more (harder to control a straight motion) but once you get used to it, it's awesome.  But where putting REALLY shines is when you turn the grids off.  Holy moly!  The greens are every bit as readable as they are in real life.  I simply teleport to about 3-4 feet behind my ball, crouch down and start reading the greens.  Then, while still squatting down, I teleport up a little to read other areas as needed.  I plan my putt, teleport back to the ball and execute.  And, for me... it's spot on, dead accurate.  Playing without grids in TGC VR is the most immersive thing I've ever experience in a video game.  Drain a 20 footer for par (or better) and you'll be fist pumping like a mofo.Things that aren't so great.1 - Fairway bunkers.  EVERY single time you land in a fairway bunker you are penalized by roughly 50%.  So the best you can do is blast out into the fairway and drop a shot.  The devs are aware and are addressing this.2 - Graphics but this isn't an HBS issue as much as it is a limitation of the hardware.  Although I think there is still some optimization left to be done and I know they are looking into this constantly.3 - The setup.  VR with today's technology simply requires you to jump through a few hoops.  You've got to get your base stations mounted, you've got this huge contraption on your head with a long bundle of chords leading to your PC, etc.  It takes me about 5 minutes to setup and about 5 minutes to clean up afterwards.  With 2D golf, I just grab my controller and take off - no real setup time at all.Things that have blown me away:1 - The dev interaction on the steam forums.  Superb and professional2 - The immersion of the game and the attention to details by the dev team in producing this product3 - Putting and short game accuracy4 - Game interface.  It could've been clunky and awkward.  Nope.  Everything flows and before you hit your 3rd hole of your first ever round you'll be comfortably navigating around without giving it a second thought.5 - The difficulty and the clear fact that this is a sim and not an arcade game.  I haven't broken 90 yet and I'm still on casual level.  I'm a 13 handicap IRL.  Some may say that the game is harder than real life and in some aspects it's true but the more I play the better I'm getting and I expect to see more parity between my real life golf scores and TGC VR scores over time.In general - I couldn't be more pleased.  This is probably the single best video game experience I've ever had and it's just the beginning.  BUY THIS GAME!!"

The ambience, graphics, ball physics, etc,... are really good, but I have a complaint about the performance of the game. I have a Pc with an i7 6700, GTX 1080 and 16Gb Ram and I can not set the visual graphics in high. If I put the visual graphics in medium sometimes the game starts to judder then I have to change the visual settings to Low. Please devs improve the performance of the game. Another thing is that the player has not any visual help, if you try to find where the green is, the player needs to check the map or teleport around the field, for skilled players this is very good, but for noob players like me, this makes the game be a bit too hard. The same with the clubs, I don't know the average yardage with any of them, then as a sugestion for CASUAL mode, help the noob players with more info please."
76561198025044594,Recommended,489600,26176305,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,Freedious,"This is a must buy for anyone who plays golf. Had many holy **** moments, feeling like I was on a course. Even bent my knees in anguish on a few missed putts. Super imersive and the locomotion system is crisp and very functional. I love racing my shot to the green, then watching it drop from the sky with some backspin. Nice.The amount of time the ball is in the air makes it feel like you crushed the shot, and often you do. Controling your aim and your distance are very challenging but that's good. You want there to be room for improvement and tweaks to your technique. I tried one-handed and two-handed grips. Each seems to have their place. One-handed on full shots, two handed on chips and putts. Would love to see how people grip their controller and would love to see a some small club accessories that hold the Vive controller.For the devs: Great work, thank you. Here are a few of my wishes:-Driving range, chipping green and putting green so you can learn your distances and practice different swing styles.-A line on the putter head. Would help with alignment.-A camera option that teleports you to the spot where your ball will end up. Watching a shot land never gets old.-Save game feature. Don't always have time for 18.-Online, computer opponent, etc.  Not the highest priority but expected eventually.-Option to not have to hold the trigger while you swing. It got tiresome and limited the ways I could grip the controller.-Show shot distance after each shot, maybe on yardage book, so you can learn your distances better.Looking forward to the updates. Keep up the great work!"
,Recommended,489600,31179670,Posted: 16 April,all,Clay Pigeon,"I'm a terrible golfer, and The Golf Club VR allows me to reproduce that ineptitude with incredible accuracy in my very own home. The future is a marvelous place.Actually, what's really nice is being able to see exactlywhyI'm a terrible golfer. After every shot, you can review and replay every element of your swing. It's made me aware of things I've been doing wrong for years and simply couldn't perceive out in the real world. On top of that, it's a fun experience with an excellent variety of VR-optimized holes.I have a couple of caveats, though. First, current-gen VR hardware doesn't have the resolution necessary for a realistic golf game. Unless you've really cranked the graphics settings, you can't even see the pin at a distance, let alone the contours of the green. Second, if you do want to boost the graphics to a reasonable level, you'd better have a heck of a lot of horsepower in your PC. The detailed visuals are lovely to look at, but your graphics card will pay dearly for them.Also, keep in mind that you spend half the game looking down and that VR headsets aren't liquidproof. In other words, don't play this while sweating. I was playing The Golf Club VR to cool down after an extended, active VR session, and fried my goggles. It's certainly not the fault of this game, but I'm hoping this warning will spare someone else the heartache of a $270.00 repair bill."

I played live with a friend from Ottawa yesterday 18 holes for 2 hours, Shot a 105! it felt like I was playing on a real course, all I needed was a beer in my hand to sip every 5 shots. GOLFVR has over 130,000 courses and a few from Manitoba too. For $32CAN buckaroos, its an amazing achievement.

76561198077253135,Recommended,489600,32523320,Posted: 17 June,all,LeapSeven,Great golf game. Mechanics are good without being too arcade game like. Club haptics and swinging work well. Lots of courses! I am not very good at it but I am improving.Just wish I had a more poweful graphics card. I keep it on low settings and subsampling at 1 for a smoother performance. Just don't expect it to look like the screen shots or video. It looks fairly blurry and pixelated. But still fun given the limitations of hardware and the Vive's resolution.

I am sure it will improve over time.I play golf in real life too and I have to say the physics is pretty cool at the moment. My biggest complain is the need to keep the grip button pressed to hit the ball. This is a very poor choice in my opinion as it brings alot of tension in your fingers.I struggle to make powerful shots so far, I just hit a 200 yards drive compared to what I can hit in real life (around 250 yards, I play stiff Titleist irons). The feeling to ""be there"" on the course is very cool!!Now, we just need multiplayer in real time like Pool Nation VR does and it will be a great social experience for sure!So far, this looks promising... let's give these guys a chance :)To summ it up:PROS:-Immersion and the ""be on the course"" feeling-The bag where you can pick your clubs up-Physics seems on the good rails-Seems like we will get a huge library of courses to play onCONS:-No ""social"" multiplayer planned ?! Really ?!-Keeping the grip button pressed to swing is plain horrible-Quite hard to hit powerful shots (I might get used to it)-Bag is too close when you teleport to the ball, I feel like I don't have enough space to hit my ball :)-Performance which will improve I hope"

I’m about a 5 IRL, and I think while visually impressive, the games feel isn’t quite right. The distance off the clubs is all wrong relative to what I see IRL. I get that it’s hard to make the touchy stuff right, but the feel on the greens is wrong. I’ve played on a fair number of tour courses and to be honest the greens in this game are faster than anything I’ve ever seen.  Still, it looks great. I can run the game effectively on Medium Detail with a 1070, and it looks even better maxxed out, but I get the judder some others have mentioned. Hopefully there are some improvements in the efficiency department, but if not it still is very playable. As a video game it’s pretty darn good, but I think they should bring a club pro, or two, onboard to work with the feel of the game. It’s still early in the development of the game, so I believe this stuff will eventually get worked out. One thing I’d like to see is a driving range to work out the distance the clubs are going to go in the game. It’s tough to understand how on the course I hit a driver an average of 100 yards more than can find in this game. Maybe give us the ability to set the club yardages, so we can play how we play."

I'll make it short and sweet....Takes a little getting used to, but man is it compelling. I played a round of real golf earlier today, and although its not true to life golf, it's the next best thing.The Oculus Touch controllers are a litte wonky, due to it being otpimized for Vive, but it's not horrible. The menus and the sensitivity of the buttons on the Touch controllers take some finess. You also have to swing much harder than in real golf. I can drive 280-315 yards IRL, but in game I have to swing my♥♥♥♥♥off to hit 250. Putting and chipping feels satisifying.Can't wait to get more practice.... This will be a daily game for me.P.S. If you are an Oculus user and a golf lover, don't be afraid to pick up this title. I just hope the devs focus on some Rift optimizations."

Using the shot analysis in game, I found that my back swing and transition into the forward swing was much too fast and I was losing the club quite a lot resulting in my hooks and slices.I slowed down my back swing considerably and BINGO, I was hitting those drivers down the middle of the fairway.Now, I havn't has a chance to practice the slower backswing on a real golf course yet but when I do I will let you know if it has solved my problem."

Pull the course map out of your back pocket, look at your wrist to see distance to hole, elevation change, wind direction.- Simulation feel:  Feels like the PC version of The Golf Club only now in virtual reality.  My first couple holes I was swinging very hard and robotic( a problem I have in real life golf) and my shots were all over the place.  Once I slowed down my tempo and started a relax swing I started getting closer to par.- Sinking a ten foot put in the game is just as satisfying as in real life.-  Really fun to play if you like real life golf.Cons:- performance is a little bad on a 970, but there are so many technologies implemented and cross talking that I am not sure who to blame.  It is hard to judge how all the different technologies will work together, between OculusSDK, ASW, ATW, OpenVR, SteamVR, SteamVR reprojection there are bound to be some issues.  It is playable but it gets a little choppy.- a few minor bugs:  Sometimes the drop zone is too close to the water.  Sometimes the ball is too close to an obstruction to get a swing off(might be user error).  The map bugged after the 6 hole, every hole after that only showed the 6th hole map.- Controls work pretty well but could use some optimization for the rift.  Specifically the button that selects.  In the rift the capacitive button that is mapped to ""select"" picks up a button touch when it should probably only pick up a button push.Overall:If you have a Rift of Vive and like golf, this is a must buy."

,Recommended,489600,26281340,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Shark,Shaping up to be THE VR golf game. Already extremely playable with a handful of courses and even some putt-putt. Overall the swing mechanics feel good and the game can be just as gut-wrenching and frustrating as playing a real round of golf. Really goes a long way in making good shots feel rewarding instead of just...par for the course.Visually it's a good looking game. That being said I think they need to put in some serious time improving overall performance. As it stands on a 980ti you are going to be playing on the lowest settings to consistently hit 90 frames. Good news is the game still looks reasonably good at that setting.Assuming the developers can continue to improve upon the basic functions and performance as well as delivering new courses...I foresee playing this game well into the future.

If you are a golf fan like I am, you would absolutely love this and play it for hours and hours. I will admit, I struggled at first to make solid contact with the ball (as have my friends that have played), but once you get the hang of it you will find that you cannot stop playing.The big con on here, however, is green speeds. The greens are just insanely fast on this game for some reason. Approach shots, chipping, and putting can be very frustrating. A perfect approach shot that lands on the front of the green will manage to roll all the way off the back end of the green. The difference in speed from the fringe and green is also unbalanced. Normally, putting from the fringe is the common route in real life. However, I've found that chipping with a loft wedge from the fringe (which most would never do in real life) is the best way to go in this.With that said though, those are the only cons I've experienced in this game. The developers are great on updating the game and improving it. So hopefully green speeds (which I can't imagine being difficult to change) will be reduced at some point.I definitely would recommend this game to VR players, especially golf fans!"

It's not the real thing, but it's a heck of a lot closer than I ever expected it to be, even in EA.The one gripe is the performance.  I have a beefy system with a core i7, 16gb ram, and a gtx1080 and can't bump up from the lowest settings without stutter.

The good news is that the mulitiple 18 hole courses on offer in Golf Club VR provide a fair amount of longevity.I am a very occasional golfer, but I am really enjoying the game. It's not perfect (the greens are very fast and the graphics could be optimised a little better) but the dev's are active, and it already looks very pretty even on low.It does take a little time to get used to swinging the clubs, getting the distance right when approaching the green, etc, but the same could be said of golf itself!I, for one, am finding the challenge of lowering my score rewarding.Edit: Great work on the full release. Still a little blurry in the distance, but I think that is more a limitation of the hardware. The game is a lot better optimised than when I initially reviewed it -- I am happily playing on 4xAA on high settings with 1.1 SS now."

This has plenty of room for additional features to add immersion (carts please!!! with ball tracker so you can drive and easily find it). Needs performance improvements but when you use Async Reprojection with SteamVR beta it runs pretty well. You can add supersampling to see further clearly and reduce stuttering when looking around. After adjusting that to your system's capabilities it is a nice looking game and a much better experience. Only problem is even though that fixes visual stuttering of the background your club stutters when looking down and to get a reliable/smooth swing you have to use lower graphics settings. Once they get performance optimized and maybe give an option for the friction level of the green (way to glassy imo) I would say this is could soon be an A+ golf game. Right now I'd give it a B.

Topping, slicing, shanking, numerous air-hits, followed by that manic, overbalanced clubbing which so often results in one being corkscrewed into the ground. Oh, and let's not forget sand-fly fever, contracted from spending so much time in bunkers. It's all here, your lack of skill, indolent posture and flaky swing, all writ large, validated in code and preserved for posterity in your scorecard hall of shame...HOWEVER, in other news, what a game! What a bloody-minded, ♥♥♥♥♥rdly, haughty, flirty, discourteous fish-wife of a game. Those of you with the same dogged persistence and catalogue of ruined Sunday afternoons behind you will know what I mean. The course is there to be beaten of course, it never dangles too far out of reach, it merely requires a better class of player than you will ever be. But, on the right day, with the right club and sufficiently garish flannels, with that crushed drive soaring, arrow-straight, climbing, climbing, climbing into the azure sky... You are familiar, dear aspirant golfer, with the same trouser-tickle of achievement, the same dopamine hit that rivals any amount of luck at the roulette wheel. And, with the same unfailing regularity, the next spin will be a dud and the house wins. But this time it was different and - who knows? - next time may be different too.In other words, this is not a golfing simulacrum that permits one to attain, by a nurturing of benevolent algorithms and digital hand-holding, the handicap of your dreams. It *is* of course possible to choose the easy settings and take the shortcut to wish-fulfilment, but if you are one of those people who can do that and still look at yourself in the clubhouse mirror afterwards, by all means go for it. Be aware though that it will be implicitly understood by the rest of the golfing fraternity that you number among those few laughable, Quixotic golfing mountebanks who routinely drop zeros from their scorecards and kick Titleists from the undergrowth with nary a pang of conscience. Enjoy your victory, Pyrrhic as it may be...For the rest of us, keep the faith and understand the nature of the word 'addiction' in its truest sense, as your correspondent, at this very moment, prepares to slather deep heat on a pulled shoulder and cinch a lumbar support to its tightest setting in order to play another round.

76561198035364625,Recommended,489600,30438514,Posted: 10 March,all,Casimir,"I sat on this until Oculus support was released for it, and I can say now that it was well worth the wait.  Having already played many hours in the original game The Golf Club, I knew what to expect - for the most part - but the VR aspect was exciting, particularly as an avid RL golfer myself.So far, the game hasn't disappointed at all.TL&DR- For a quick rundown, the VR game places just like (well, for the most part) the original non-VR TGC.  In addition, the game links up with the main TGC game as well, so all of the courses available in the original TGC you can find, and play, in TGCVR.  The immersion is really good, the gameplay is very good, and it's just all around fun.  What's more, like others have said below, if you play golf IRL, those skills do transfer over - and not just the good skills, but also the bad (I still... STILL... hook the ball off the tee with the driver...).In-Depth Review- For those of you who enjoy golf and have a Vive or Oculus, you simply cannot beat this.  To be able to play a round whenever you like without having to leave the house is great (naturally, however, I'd still prefer to be out playing IRL when possible - but this is such a close second).Graphics - the graphics for the Oculus are really good; I have mine cranked to maximum (2x normal) and it looks really smooth and plays great (I have a rig that can handle that however).Gameplay - I could get very detailed here, but I'm going to focus instead on the VR mechanics specifically.  The interface is a lot different from the original TGC... there is no ""hud,"" etc.  Most of the menu items are there, you just have to navigate to them differently.  When selecting a course to play, it's not quite as easy to find courses as in the original TGC, mostly because the menu doesn't show a ""list"" like the original - instead it shows a picture of the course and it's name (which means there's fewer courses in view).  You can search for a course just like normal, but it's a bit clunky as you use an in-game keypad to type your search criteria.  What I've done is simply favorite all the course I play that I like - easy to find them again.In regard to the standard ""hud"" information, like distance to the pin, the winds, elevation, etc., that can be found on your ""wristwatch.""  You simply hold up your wrist a turn it like you're looking at a watch and the data shows up.  In addition, once you've struck a ball, you can hold up your wrist and click the button on the handle of the Touch to see the distance your shot went - it even grades you on your shot (the grade consists of several factors - impact, distance, and the lie once the ball stops).  It will also show you the speed of your swing, which is nice (apparently my swings hover between the 72-78 mph range).If you hold down the handle button on the Touch while you swing, it will ""record"" your swing so you can turn and see a graphical indication of how the club head traveled on the takeaway all the way through to impact, and it will show you the angle and location of the club at impact as well.  This is really, really helpful, particularly to newer players.Picking clubs is actually rather cool.  To pick up a club, you simply teleport to your bag (or walk, if you're play area is big enough), reach into your bag, hold the Touch over the club you want, and click the trigger.  Options exist to allow you to have to hold the trigger to keep the club in your hand, or just press the trigger once to grab it, and later a second time to drop it.  As an amusing afterthought, you can hit the club bag with what ever club you have in your hand to knock it over, spilling your clubs everywhere if you're on a slope.Taking a shot is just like taking one IRL.  Address the ball, line up and aim, and swing.  The swing mechanics are very touchy, and if you don't swing correctly, you're ball will hook, slice, skip across the grass (if you top the ball), etc. - just like with real golf.After a shot, you use one of the Touch's buttons (B) to teleport to your ball (your clubs automatically follow you).  You can alternatively use A to teleport where ever you want (literally - you can't teleport into water though).  A note on the greens - again, if you have a play area that is big enough, you can walk completely around your putting area and look closely at the path to the cup... it really helps when putting.In addition, you can get a bird's eye view of the hole by reaching behind you in-game and grabbing the yardarge booklet, which will show you a top down view of the hole with yardage notations of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 yards from the pin.  This is really handy, particularly with holes where the pin is obscured either by trees or a hill in the fairway - unlike TGC, there is no ""zoom"" feature that allows a flyover of the hole out to the distance of the selected club.All these mechanics work very good with the Oculus Touch; as I said above, it's a great experience and a lot of fun to play.Cons- The only cons are what other's have said - just a couple of which I'll reiterate here, touching specifically upon Oculus and the Oculus Touch.The first is the setup of your play area.  For me I had to set my default view 90 degrees to the left (my computer is on the right of my desk) because if I didn't the wire that connects the Oculus to the system got in the way every time I swung.  I don't know if this is the cause of my issues or not (in my case, it means one of my sensors is pointing at my right rear instead of in front of me).  But occasionally when I swing the club simply won't strike the ball - or, it'll strike it ""off"" - for example, occasionally my shots will shoot off about 20 degrees to the left, not with a hook, but straight and clean, as if I was aiming that direction.  To be clear, I don't know if this is a tracking issue or an issue with my setup - so keep that in mind.However, as another user has said, when using the Protee Simulator to practice your swings, the tracking itself does seem off.  I couldn't even get the driver to make contact with the ball... all the other clubs worked okay though, but still suffered occasionally from the same issue I described above.For Oculus users specifically, the Touch is a hit / miss when it comes to ""gripping the club.""  I imagine that Vive users have it better because the Vive controller is longer and it looks like the player can grip it at least somewhat like a club with both hands.  With the Oculus Touch, however, the controller is so small there is no room to grip it with your off-hand.  As a result I end up gripping my right wrist with my left hand (I'm right handed) - which I'm sure contributes some to my off shots.  If there was a controller add-on that could add some length to the Touch for this it would help a lot.Those things being said though, these are not game changers (unless you take your golf REALLY seriously), and annoyances at best in what is still an excellent, fun game.Overall, again, for anyone interested in golf that has a Vive or Oculus, you cannot go wrong with The Golf Club VR."

Poof! an update comes out that gives you more customization of your club and the stiffness you prefer.(hmmm I wonder if they would take a request for some sort of zoom or distance increase to see the approach shot a little better, POOF A GOD DAMN RANGE FINDER!The support from the devs from day one to Feb 23rd was absolutely world class. they not only responded to almost every single question asked (if it hadnt already been answerd by one of us)but they addedrequested features sometimes almost bi weekly. I watched a very good start of a golf vr sim turn into a full fleged polished simulator in the matter of months, not years. along the way the devs have asked for feedback and even played rounds with you if the time was available.at first optimization was a little rough but it was such an ambitious game that I didnt bat an eye to it. at the time of this review, high end systems are basking in maxed out pure links heaven. My rig can run low with most sliders cranked up (msaa, AA) with no problem. this is the only game I own thats made me want to upgrade to a 1080 just to enjoy at full potential.If you are a golfer at all, and I mean putt-putt, casual, league, or rising star. you will have at least 40 to 50 hours worth of virtual ""safety at home"" golf that we all love but mostly cant really afford. thats for the leather puss's!

I had played Cloudland Mini Golf and found that at least when it comes to putting the use of the Vive controller is sufficiently convincing.  But how would that translate to a full golf swing without the use of a full club?  As it turns out quite well.  Granted the feel of the weight of the club isn't there but the mechanics of the swing are still the same.It's extremely enjoyable to be able to play a round of golf without needing to leave my house and without the annoyance of searching for my ball every time it leaves the fairway.  This is especially useful during an Ohio winter when the cold makes golfing outside a bit miserable.I'm very excited to see how the upcoming Vive Tracker adds to this experience.  Using an actual club will certainly enhance the experience.The only problem I've run into so far is when I hit the ball off a cliff on the insanely challenging Pacific Jewel course.  The drop zone ended up being the side of a nearly vertical cliff face.  This left me in a bit of a dilemma as no matter where I dropped the ball it would simply fall into the water.  Without being able to figure out any other options I eventually had to abandon that game.  Perhaps a ""skip current hole"" option could be put in place for unpredictable occurrences such as that."

I am a long time golf and video game patron and this is a great blend of both. I constantly remind myself that this is virtual reality and this is an early access game. So I'm not expecting all the bells and whistles, but am confident that when the developers fine tune everything needed...this will be the greatest golf simulation ever.So if you have the computer specs and the Vive, this better be one of the first things purchased.

Graphics are very poor - the screenshots on the store page must be taken from the 2D version, because it looks NOTHING like that in VR with almost no lighting effects and very basic scenery. And yes, that's on the very highest setting. You'd think with such basic visuals and a static, dead world it would at least run buttery smooth. Wrong again - on a 4.6GHz 6700K, 32GB and a 1080 (x2 if anything in VR ever uses SLI) it judders and stutters like crazy. I'm not even sure why they tease you with MSAA and SS options at this point.Then comes the confusing club selection (a 5 wood shoots further than a driver apparently). Talking of drivers, good luck reliably connecting with the ball using that thing. On the plus side, you can at least throw your clubs around in frustration - it simulates that aspect of golf very well.If you really must have a golf game in VR, then get this since you have no other choice.

I play golf regularly, and taking a swing in game felt so natural. The ball flew exactly as far as I suspected it to based on swing speed and club choice. I attempted a slight slice off the tee with great success. I knocked one into the sand and you really get that feel of having to put a little extra into it to chunk it out of there. Putting was nothing short of majestic, and the short game felt like the real thing. Being able to throw the clubs/bag is a nice touch because just like in real golf you'll constantly feel the need to chuck those things into the nearest lake.That being said, the only complaint that I have is the performance of the game. Since we're talking golf, my computer is more the John Daly of the PGA tour as opposed to Tiger Woods, however I've not experienced jutter or frame drops in any game/demo up to this point on my Vive.  Upon firing the game up for the first time the jutter was so bad it would have had lesser men seizing on the floor and vomiting blood. I promptly exited the game, and bumped the setting down to low, and still experienced a pretty significant amount of jutter. At this point it's pretty unplayable for me on my i5 6500 and GTX 1060 even on the low setting, so if you have specs similar to mine you may want to hold off till the frame rate gets lined out.Also as mentioned in some other reviews this is ""tailor made"" for multiplayer, and would be an amazing experience to get a group together and go out and play on the course.Overall if the performance is fixed, this is an absolute must have. Physics are spot on, and it's everything you'd want out of a golf game. It's a surreal feeling to swing in VR and see the ball go exactly as you wanted it, likewise knowing you absolutely duffed one and for that to be reflected as well. Solid 10/10 if the frame rate becomes playable with my setup."

There are lots of little sounds I didn't even know I wanted in a golf VR game before now. The sounds of the grass as you skim it or pat it with your club are really immersive. The watch on your wrist and the distance book are well designed and actually very useful. The swing mechanics seem very accurate, and seem to reflect real life shot styles well.

It's exactly the type of tutorial you need for games like this.The menu is also well designed and easy to navigate.The courses themselves are great but sadly the graphics are not on the same level..The performance is pretty bad for how the game looks period. There's no arguing there.Also with supersampling (In-game) set to 1 (standard) the aliasing is insanely noticable and very annoying, however truning it up to 1.3 or above makes it a lot better for only a small performance loss.Performance got better but is still not good enough for the visual quality.Also there are a couple reoccuring bugs that impact gameplay a little.In conclusion I would recommend the game to people who enjoy golfing or are interested in it.If you don't really care about the unlit environment then I imagine you'll enjoy these courses.If you just want to casually do some mini golf then this game is not for you.____________________Initial review:This isn't about the game in particular but I think Golf is just not suitable for this generation of VR. In this sport you have to look at the ball when swinging to get it right but with the way the fresnel lenses work the vision is way too blurry when looking down.Maybe this will be good for people with that welding mask mod or something similar but I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with the stock Vive head straps.Also I've never played golf but I doubt that the curves the ball flies on very strong hits are correct.The graphics are standard, water is pretty cool and I really enjoyed the grass but otherwise the game looks pretty plain and boring.The performance is horrible, I'm getting close to reprojection with several dips below 90 on medium with a 980ti."

One thing I might like to see added in this aspect of the game is the ability to choose to toggle holding the club or map as opposed to having to hold the trigger the whole time.The map in your back pocket is good for seeing the overall hole and checking distances (the dots are 50 yards apart as a guide). Your watch has handy info, too. Haptic feedback is well-done; you know if you're in the right spot to grab your map and you can feel the ground with the clubhead before you swing.The teleporting system is nice. You can zip straight to a stance in front of your ball, or choose to walk along the course and take in the scenery. Reviewing your swing in 3D afterwards is pretty cool. It's like it draws your swing with TiltBrush and you can see how smooth you were and how far back the backswing was.The graphics look great even on low settings, IMO. I get better performance from this game on higher settings than I do in Pool Nation VR, for example. The golf glove texture on the Vive controller is a nice touch. Recommended."

If (like me) you feel like you are lacking long lasting experiences in VR, get this! It will help if you enjoy Golf of course. If you've played IRL, skills actually transfer. But, it really needs a golf grip/vive tracker controller as the standard controllers are obviously the wrong shape and induce club head control issue simply because you can't get your hands where you would normally. But, it doesn't take long to adapt your grip to work around this.I've had this from Early Access, and found myself playing this for several hours each time I loaded it up.And now, with full release, performance issues are not a problem any more (note I'm on a GXT1080 and run steamvr at 2.0 ss, with in game detail at high), swing tracking is definitely better as well.Minor suggestion/gripe:Although I haven't fully inspected the full release, so this may be in there, I would like to be able to choose a ball type to ""tune"" backspin. At one point during the early access changes, backspin was too pronounced and a real pain to keep the ball on the green as it would accelrate back off the surface everytime. Now, I don't seem to be able to induce any backspin at all.You will get your £23 worth out of this if you enjoy golf.Obviously, ensure you have space to make swings, you will hit things in your room hard if you do not and USE THE WRIST STRAP!EDIT TO ADD:i7 4790K 4.4ghz16GB RamASUS GTX 1080 STRIX OC"

Another thing that sucked was with the irons there is no sticking point for the length of the club. The more you lean down to get your club head even, the more the handle shortens, so it is practically impossible to get a feel for how to set your club head on those shots and all the clubs feel underpowered for my swing, except the putter. The greens are like glass covered with a very slippery oil.  A hint of breath will send your ball skittering to the netherworld. Choosing clubs was completly unituitive. If you want to give players an option to actually walk to the bag and choose a club instead fo a menu, then give them that choice, but I found the walk to the bag and trying to get the controller to set on one club in a tightly clusteed bundle to be unnecessarily cumbersome. I thought I might be able to get some enjoyment out of the putt putt course but it is a completely unimaginative skid fest as well (see green speed) In short, this one should remain in the sub $5 bargain bin until  a long long process of refinement takes place.

It also needs  to be pretty tight on your head to stop it slipping or falling away from your face. This for me was a major factor( more than any other VR game) in me refunding an otherwise excellent Golf Sim.

With my competative mind set, I feel cheated every time this happens, and makes it very difficult to finish rounds without quitting the game in disgust.  Worth noting I've tried some changes with my VR setup for better results, nothing yet.  Other VR games are running flawlessly.edit: In earlier versions of the game I occasionally ran into this performance issue, but now it happens multiple times per round.  The effect on putts and chips makes this game umplayable for me.Golf Grades (again - my experience - it seems like different people really have different experiences with the motion tracking and club success in this game).Driver:  F- , Yes, F minus - Driver to me is one of the easiest shots in golf (real golf).  not THE easiest, but one of.  It is a single repeatable swing, with a huge faced club, on a ball teed way up.  For the life of my, I can't hit driver in this game.  Half the time I see the club head go right through the ball, the other half I get wildly inconsistent results.  It is a worthless club to me in this game.  I use 3I as my driving club.  How in the world can 3i be so easy to hit off the tee an driver is not?Fairway Woods:  F   I can hit these just slightly better than driver, and so?  though I've tried, and tried, and tried... again, not useful clubs for me to use.Irons:  C   For me, a full swing iron can end up 30 yards short, 20 yards long, sometimes correct... but I have no idea why shots are ending up where they do after 100's (probably 1000's) of swings.Chipping:  D   Ultimatly I ask, does this game provide the finesse around the green with wedges that the pros play with?  The answer is a resounding: NO!  Not even close - and the greens in this game require incredible finesse in order to score.  Chipping (in this game) has this kind of robotic land and predictable release that is unnatural.  Combine this with percentage ranges based on bad lies (like a 60-80% contact in deep rough)?  The result of a chip may have very little to do with your skill, and more to do with a lucky (or unlucky) contact%, and an unnatural rollout.  Can a good chip be hit?  Yes, especially with a good lie - and with the short roll out you always have a chance for a chip to roll in the hole (if your on the correct line).  But I would Way rather have more control of spin options, so that with practice I could roll out, stop the ball, or backspin.  This is the type of control needed to score on some of the very challenging greens in this game.  Chipping has been further harmed (for me) with occasional chips that go way further or way shorter than expected.Putting:  A, when it works.   Occasional random results can have a short putt getting bashed through the hole and 10+ feet on your next putt...  this type of result in a golf game is beyond frustrating - its a game killer.  I feel the hole edge is a bit unforgiving (you really have to get a lot of the hole, and at correct speed to make putts), and putting certain hole locations on fast greens can be unfair (3 and 4 putts with good attepts is not uncommon).Video Game GradesGraphics  C  - while it is impressive how the entire golf course is there in real time, the actual visuals are average.Sound C  - I feel sound could have been a real benefit to this game in terms of building the environment and letting the player know about wind/ wind direction.  Sound is very average, and really adds very little to the overall presentation beyond the necessary swing noises and such.Control  D  -   I'm running into a lot of issues, and have to mark this down accordingly.Fun Factor  F  - Until I can play a clean game with consistency - playing this game is more a test of patience than fun.edit:  my review has done a 180 since early access - because it plays a worse game of golf than it did in earlier versions.  Clubs like driver and fairway woods did not improve in how they are balanced.  My consistency with irons, wedges and putter have gotten worse with extended play.  This is not a ringing endorcement for a game where you  want the ability to find a groove and have fun playing golf.  This final version for me is a disappointment"
