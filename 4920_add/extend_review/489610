76561198012040033,Not Recommended,489610,24235935,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,BearInABackpack,"Upon first glance at Chicken Assassin: Master of Humiliation on Steam, the game seemed like a 2D brawler games involving fowl in fisticuffs. If you read the description of the game, it would have you believe it is an “Epic Action RPG! Full of Sarcastic and Hilarious Characters…”. It is very difficult to tell that it is actually a clicker game, with no mention of this fact in the description or trailers. Let's see how it stacks up.The gameplay of Chicken Assassin is very much as you would expect for a clicker game. As Mean McCallister, Chicken Assassin, you aggressively click-to-death each and every enemy that come storming in from off screen, clearing wave after wave of these baddies until you reach the boss of the level. And once you do reach the boss, you guessed it, you click it into submission. Defeating enemies provides you with items that you can use to give McCallister stat boosts to increase his battle effectiveness, and souls you use to purchase items and upgrades. You also unlock new outfits from time to time through collecting enough of certain item drops or beating certain enemies etc.The upgrades available to you come in two forms; resource and character. Resource upgrades are focused on increasing the frequency that you obtain souls and the value they possess. This can be something on the level of directly increasing the numeric value per soul or something like purchasing little flame minions to gather souls while you are away (this is one of many portions of the game that seem very mobile gamey). The character upgrades give direct, permanent, stat boosts to Mean McCallister, like increased defense or increase critical chance percentage. You don’t really run into too many spots where you do not have enough souls to get upgrades, due to the “Rooster Tales”, the games achievements that award various amounts of souls as a reward for their completion. That being said, one extremely annoying feature that reeks of mobile game is the “Soul Limit” that you have to spend souls to increase. There were several times were I would earn a 500,000 soul reward only to receive 100,000 and the rest disappear into the ether because “I can’t carry that many souls”. It doesn’t even tell you your current souls limit, so you have no way of knowing if you are close to full or not.After playing for an hour or so, you will quickly realize the pattern of gameplay. Since there is no way to heal outside of an upgrade that gives you a chance to heal after defeating an enemy or leveling up mid-game (instant full health), and the enemies usually get their attack(s) before you can react to them, you will click madly trying to stay alive whilst constantly bleeding health until the boss one-shots you and you have to restart the level. You will keep repeating the cycle of fight, die, re-equip, fight again over and over until you get lucky with the level up timing or are so over leveled you can murder anything in your path and beat the level. But, when you start the next level, it starts all over again, you get your teeth kicked in, so you die, re-equip, fight again etc. It is just the same thing over and over and over, and it gets boring extremely quickly.While the sound effects are quite good for the game, the music is another beast all together. Mediocre at its best and irritatingly bad at worst. The main menu music (before you pay souls to unlock more music…in a game you paid for already) is a seemingly random assortment of drum beats and synths, with some weird pitched up vocals meandering around in the background that soon fades to almost out of tune piano chords. Most times you are better off playing with the music turned down.The worst thing of all however is the blatant racist and sexist imagery the game uses for background characters and enemies. In the very first mission, there is an Asian man with thick round glasses with buck teeth and a rice hat betting on the game, with what looks like a black face caricature eating a fried chicken leg. In the riot scene you fight overweight women with picket signs that read “Free the Nipple”. Their title: “Angry Feminist”. It gets worse when you get to the “Borderlands” level in which you are fighting outside of a gigantic concrete wall where your enemies are “Vatos” and “Wetbacks”. In what way is this okay?!?! It’s astonishing that a game like this was greenlit on Steam, let alone has such high ratings. If these depictions were meant to be in jest (though still in poor taste), it should have been made more clear.Final OpinionPros:1.	Oil Painting ArtStyle is Cool2.	Visual Effects are Well Done3.

That's the context of this commentary.I really enjoyed Chicken Assassin. Right out of the gate... ""Chicken Assassin"". Amirite?? Great name.The 'click in the lobby' mixed with the 'click against waves of mobs' mechanic was a nice bit of diversity. The upgrade system was simple without the need for a sliderule to figure things out. Unlocking wardrobe items is the driving reason to replay levels after you cap out.It was totally worth the 1.99$ I paid. If you like clickers and casual games, I don't think you will be disappointed."

Probably one of the highest quality clicker games I've ever played; only down side is that it's pretty short. 8 hours of gameplay, but it was a FUN 8 hours, which is pretty rare nowadays.It is a clicker game, but not necessarily an idle game. Music is superb, artwork and animations were on point, and the scaling wasn't too easy nor too hard. Balance is perfect, and each level has its own feel to it.10/10, would assassinate again."

It is also a bit like a clicker game in that you have to keep clicking as fast as possible to kill your enemies before they kill you. There are also RPG elements were you can find equipment and mold your character to fit your preferences and you level up various abilities that make fights easier in various ways.The control in combat takes a little getting used to - essentially regardless of whether you have a melee weapon or a sniper rifle you always have to wait until the enemy moves into position before you can start damaging them, and even if you are using a melee weapon you can hit them wherever they end up stopping - most come into close range, but there are a few exceptions that hang out nearer the edges of the screen and can be easy to miss if lots of other attackers are closing in.It has a few flaws like this, but overall it is a fairly interesting and different game."
