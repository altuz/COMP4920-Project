The space bending thing is really cool and sometimes it's really hard to figure out the exit which makes this a good game :)The good:- The idea and the concept and a good execution- Music fits very well and it's good!The bad:I've not played for a long time (15 levels to be exact) but the repetion of the places starts to get boring.I'd recommend this game for those who asks for a challenging puzzle game!

Or do they?Positive experience overall, give it a try"

If you are a fan of First Person Puzzle Games, you should give this game a try.And, by going through locked achievements, I seem to understand that there can be a refund chance if you beat the game under 2 hours. Should be exciting to see people try that."

Once you get past some rage and understand the mechanics, it's very straight forward.  Think Qbeh-1, Portal, and Parkour.  If you're a first person puzzle maniac like me, get this.Things to know:The green cube in some levels is a save point.Most levels do not have save points.The levels are a mix of easy to hard all the way to the end.Some levels you can become trapped, though this is pretty rare and if you put your brain on overdrive, you can solve most anything.10/10Make another game based on these mechanics, it's worth it!!!$10 is a perfect price too."

76561198021876838,Recommended,489660,31577304,Posted: 6 May,all,Vivoc,"I dont like puzzle games, I dont like fps games. But one of my close friends insisted that I should play the game. So I bought it, played it and loved it. It seems very simple at first 10 to 20 levels due to its simple gameplay. But the puzzle designs make you think 3 dimensional, make you work you brain. Thats where I loved it. You cannot brute force to solve puzzles thats another plus for the game. There are some problems of course like visual shotages and lack of story given to player and the game some times makes your computer cry...Most of the comments say Fabric is like Portal but I dont think it is true. Yes both of them are fps puzzle games you have a gun on your hand but thats all. Gameplay is very very different. And If you ask me, the mechanics are better..."
,Recommended,489660,30693921,Posted: 23 March,all,.....(tooltipler),"I'm a huge puzzler fan and I have been following this game before it's release. Now that I have had a chance to play it, I feel like I must say a few things about this game. I am not going to go deep in explaining game mechanics in this review, but it is a mechanic that I never saw in any game before where you bend the level between two cubes and those cubes converge while the space between them vanishes, rendering us able to progress.First of all the level designs are great. They teach you the game the Nintendo way: by making you figure it out with placing obstacles along the way, and along the way they make sure you have learned how to use that mechanic, otherwise you can't progress. Along with that there are really challenging levels that intrugues your brain. I had to think a lot in some levels as the game progressed. I also like the simplistic design of the game, as there are very few things that feel out of the line in art design. Another minor side that is good about this game is that it is very lightweight and you never wait between the levels and scenes as it smoothly progresses to the next level even in hard drives.Moving to the cons of the game, I must say that there are some: The most important one being the color choices, and although I don't especially like the design, I am talking about your eyes. They will get hurt if you play it too much, which is not likely in most games these days, as most of them have figured using color schemes that work well. About game design, the level progression is ridiculous. After you have finished early levels that ought to teach you the game mechanics, you get to see challenging levels as you progress; but after that level there might come a really easy level or a moderately difficult level that uses the same game mechanic or an approach to solve which you have just mastered using in the previous levels, and they appear to be no challenge at all, where you pass them for nothing. One way to solve this problem would be placing those levels before the difficult one. Another thing I have to mension about level design would be the dead end cases. Yes, I can restart the level from checkpoint but reaching a dead end without return is a little inconvenient while you still live. Talking about checkpoints, it was pretty hard to understand the purpose of the checkpoint box, as it had a weird animation where the whole level shrinks in to this box instantly and you just get confused about what is going on all of a sudden. I understood it when I saw the fading Fabric logo on the lower right corner, as it means the game is being saved in most games.So overall,Pros:+Distinct, innovative game mechanic+Challenging levels+Great way to teach game mechanics without tutorials+Simplistic design+Very Lightweight, no loading screensCons:-Colors, your eyes get hurt-Inconsistent level progression-Dead ends that force you to restart levelI would definitely recommend this game as the challenging levels and the distinct game mechanics instantly pulled me in. I don't recall so many puzzle games that intrigued me like this game did. The only big problem here is that the game is tiring for the eyes, and you have to bear with this respect of the game if you want to play it."

,Recommended,489660,33354093,Posted: 7 July,all,Baroque,"Excellent puzzle game about bending spacetime and gravity to accomplish goals. Can be frustratingly difficult at times and elegant at other times, but never felt unfair. The basic puzzles are in the vein of Portal (with a twist) while introducing a slew of new mechanics throughout the 65 levels. The only thing missing for fans of Portal are the voiceovers, but Fabric's puzzles are possibly even more challenging and mind bending. If reviewers could mark off more than just a ""Yes/No"" I'd subtract a point or two for the subpar ending. A-"
,Recommended,489660,25987890,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,Paidian,Its been a while since I played something refreshing and new. Controls feel a little bit weird (you can't strafe when you jump) but it appears to be more like a design choice than a restraint because it doesn't hinder neither the experience you get from the game nor the fun you're having while you're enjoying it.

76561198196521454,Recommended,489660,31410511,Posted: 28 April,all,wanderwoman222,"A fun little puzzler. Not as challenging or as pretty as Q-Beh, but well worth the $3 I spent on it. The visuals are a little annoying at times (lots of flashing lights, which is why they have to give seizure warnings), and there's no story to speak of. But if you like spatial logic puzzles, this one is challenging without being hard. You probably won't have to look up any solutions (I didn't, anyway).  If you like this game, try: The Witness, The Talos Principle, or Q-Beh."
