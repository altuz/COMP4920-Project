,Recommended,489760,29568122,Posted: 29 January,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Demon Truckis one of those hidden gem arcade games that really showcases a novel mechanic.I should have picked this up long ago. If you are into arcade games with mechanics that are simple-to-learn, yet impossible-to-master likeDownwellorOne Finger Death Punch, you'll likely really enjoyDemon Truck.Essentially, you only need two buttons; the right mouse button accelerates/shields you, and the left mouse button attacks in random directions.The truck is possessed, and steers itself. It generally avoids obstacles, but if you are going to hit one, you just accelerate/shield through it. By using the attack, you refill the accelerate/shield meter, and vice-versa. Sounds complicated, but it is brilliantly simple. There are neat upgrade choices at the end of each round. Do you want another turret, or would you like to refill your health - that kind of thing.Definately has that one-more-run appeal that will have you chasing your friend's scores on the leaderboards.Pros:+Really neat and novel mechanic+Controls are as simple as it gets - literally two buttons+Each level ends with a choice of upgrades that add a cool high-risk-high-reward component+Super cheapCons:-I'd be hard pressed to find any 'cons' with this little gem - if you know of any, please comment belowWell worth it for any lover of indie games."

The inability to actually steer, and the controls consiting of entire left side of keyboard and entire right side of keyboard, its truly a good time to see how far you can get."

Ruined entirely by one fatal flaw.Roadblocks are the only real threat you face.  They pop out of the top of the screen with only a split second given to react.  You're supposed to push the boost button to break through them, but if you're too slow you will take damage.  The truck is supposed to help you by auto-steering around them, but you quickly discover that this gimmick is something you simply cannot rely on.  The view is very zoomed in, so you cannot see these hazards coming in advance.The meat of the game, fighting enemies, is really easy.  You will effortlessly parry enemy fire, chew through bosses, but every run will end because of road hazards chipping away at your health one by one.Yes, I have the reflexes to deal with the roadblocks.  No, I don't think it's fun, because that is the only challenge this game offers.  You're just trying to be vigilant about one small part of the gameplay while you utterly decimate all other threats.  It's very unbalanced game design, and I cannot recommend it."

The other accelerates/parries.You avoid bullets by ramming into them while accelerating. It is quite satisfying.Definitely a fun title and the music is fantastic."

Other than that, it's sort-of like Downwell and a Shmup had a demonic baby, that baby built a car, and then sold the car to Doomguy.Also, in that video, I get rank #15 inTHE WORLD. So y'know. I know what I'm doing."

I do like the game but if you included a mode where you could move to dodge enemy attacks, you would have one hell of a shooter on your hands."

,Recommended,489760,31017654,Posted: 8 April,all,psyCtrl,Minimalistic arcade awesomess; as simple as it gets - two buttons: boost and run over or shoot to kill. Nevertheless it has suprising depth in those quite simple mechanics. Bought it in sale and it's still worth every cent. Quick game for short burst of demonic joy.
,Recommended,489760,34140487,Posted: 9 August,all,SirCabbage,"You want big booms? You want DEMON TRUCK.You want a demon? YOU WANT DEMON TRUCK.How about trucks, you want those? Yeah baby- YOU WANT DEMONTRUCKRIGHTNOW.Look, I am just sayin' man, trucks are cool, demons are cool, its like $5 and supports a great dev. What have you got to lose?In all seriousness, what you are getting here is a short arcadey bit of fun. You may play it a lot, you may play it a little. Each run is generally not very long but if you just feel like crashing and bashing for a bit there are many worse ways you could use your time. It takes a little roguelike with a little bullet hell and makes it into a 3 min activity."
