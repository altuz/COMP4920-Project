I put probably 1000+ hours into it, even without all the DLC's. Many different characters, roles, etc. I loved everything this game offered. Fast foward to now, Great PC, so I bought this. Basically non-stop playing with a few breaks here and there, plus sleep. Still the best RPG I've played to this date.Seriously, if you haven't played Skyrim at all, in all these years... do yourself a favor - play it.You won't regret it."

I will do it ASAPThere are so many reviews of Skyrim, so you probably know what it's about.The real question is: Should you buy this or the original Skyrim?Here are some key points to consider:-It is much cheaper than Skyrim with DLC's-It comes bundled with ALL the DLC's from the original Skyrim-Comes with a built-in mod manager intended to be used by mods fromBethesda.net-Saves are reworked - you get seperate save files for each character you create, and there are seperate saves for modded characters, so it is easy to revert back to a time when you didn't break skyrim with mods!-It is (as of writing this review) LESS modable than the original Skyrim. SKSE has not yet been updated for a 64-bit version and is a dependancy for a lot of the more complex mods.-The old 3.3GB ram restricion has been removed causing fewer crashes due to running out of memory and boosting the FPS in large battles.-Stable Alt+Tab! It no longer puts your mouse pointer on-screen after an Alt-Tab (like in the original Skyrim), resulting in fewer restarts and less annoyance.-Updated to 64bit, much more stable in general and a boon to mods in the long run.-Rain and snow now don't pass through rocks and other scenery, increasing a bit of immersion and making the terrain feel more ""real"".-Added God Rays, forrests look much prettier now.-Depth of field, can be a little annoying in open areas, but makes conversations with NPC's a look lot nicer.-Sleek black new launcher, removed the 'Data Files' option and moved it to the main menu.-Slightly better looking bethesda logo on startup.-The poor sound quality was fixed in a patch, the music sounds the same as the original Skyrim (which is in this case, a good thing).So, do I recommend it?If you have never played/owned a version of skyrim before, there is no reason not to buy it. It's cheaper ($5 for all the DLC's) and is more stable.If you own Skyrim and all the DLC's, there is not much reason to buy this for full price - wait for a sale if you want it (unless money isn't a big deal to you, in that case, buy away!).If you own the original Skyrim but with no DLC's, then I reccomend it because it is cheaper than buying all the DLC's for it.Thank you for reading my review! I'm new to this kind of thing, suggest some things I can do better in the comments!"

,Recommended,489830,30109382,Posted: 22 February,all,♥ Rebecca ♥,"[This is a PC review of the game]When The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition came out, I really took a disliking to it. I knew that there would be no added quests or anything like that - that is was literally a slight graphical and performance overhaul. Now, anyone that has played the original Skyrim will know that it needed a performance overhaul from day one, so this ""Remastered"" game really got our attention.While remastered does come with the DLC all included, it is rather expensive in comparison to Skyrim. I have to put it out there now, that I don't think it is worth full price,ESPECIALLYnot if you own the old game. It doesn't add enough new content to warrant that price.Performance:The Skyrim Special Edition game makes a better use of the power and capabilities behind 64-bit operating systems. The older game would only use certain amounts of your VRAM and power from other various components of your PC. As a result, the game was quite clunky to play, even at times without mods. Many people would go on to mod it, and like myself, some did it quite heavily. The technical limitations of the game in this way soon presented problems in the forms of frequent CTD's (Crashes to Desktop) and infinate freezes / load screens. I have not had these issuesas frequentlywith Skyrim Special Edition. That, however, is not to say it's free of them either.When actually playing the game, it does feel much smoother than the original one. Sudden freezes, and that clunky stop and start feel have been almost entirely eliminated, and even with a few mods (I've started modding it already) it runs like you'd expect a game should do.Graphics:The remastered game has faced graphical improvements too. The game has its own built in ENB now, and consequently it looks a lot smoother. Grass and trees have been edited to look slightly better than the original game, and grass is more dense. Not as dense as mods will get it, but nonetheless, there is more of it. I like this, but wish they had gone further with it.The view range, and the quality of the view that you see has aslo been improved. You can see further out, and it is in more detail. I like this a lot as it feels much more immersive than watching stuff load in in front of you.Weather systems have been improved too. There are some really quite nice vanilla ambiances and weathers that appear throughout the game, and this was a nice change to the dull, grey feel of the last game.Having said all of that, I did still feel let down by how little the game had changed, and how much better most of us modders had done it on the old game.Modding:Unfortunately, Bethesda really screwed up the modding system. I understand that the game was made so that console users could also experience modding, I feel that was done at the cost of the PC users. The idea behind usingBethesda.netto download mods for the game is about as reliable as using the Steam workshop on the old game. If you mod properly, you're going to run in to a lot of issues with it. Thankfully, for PC users, Nexus Mod Manager and LOOT did come to save the day, but nonetheless, I have to criticise Bethesda's thinking on that one.Unfortunatley, the one thing that kept the last game alive so long - modders - were kinda shafted on this one too. I am not this well-informed on mod creation, but the updated game has changed the way in which mods work / need to be made. As a result of this, some of our most-needed mods such as SkyUI and SKSE are not yet with us, and from that, any former users will agree, we all suffer. There has been nothing to suggest that these mods, and many others that we lost, will not come eventually, but it will take a while.Verdict:Overall, I think this game was a bit of a money grab to be honest. I, while I still do like it, and not 'satisfied' with it as such. What little has changed hasn't made such a massive difference to the game that it warrants paying over doubble the proce of the old game. Because I love Skyrim itself, I have to give it a strong 10/10, but as a NEW game - a remaster, I can't give it more than a 4/10 really. In my opinion, it's not good enough. However, I got it free because I owned all the content from the old game, so I am not too unhappy. If I'd paid for it I would be.If you've never played Skyrim before, and you're on console, this will appeal to you, and it would be worth it for you, perhaps, but I don't feel it brought anything new to the PC front. The modding community is still ahead of this game. Ultimatly though, I can't dislike it. It is (because it's Skyrim) an amazing game.Thank you for reading my review!Talos be with you all.P.S. Sorry, can I just tag this on the end. Character still lookTERRIBLEA lack of mods means you have to play as the most ugly, dirty, wrinkled, shrivelled, potato-looking cretin I have ever seen in a game. PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF TALOS, DO SOMETHING WITH THE CHARACTER CUSTOMISATION!Thank you."

The 64-bit version makes it more stable in my opinion. The graphical changes actually quite good, because there is more grass and plants, the trees looks better, sun glare, god rays, Depth of Field and the new lightning. And I can not forget to say that the viewdistance is a big improvement.Of course this can not compete with a modded 32-bit Skyrim, so this is compared with vanilla Skyrim.Absolutely worth the free upgrade or a buy for those who don't own the game.The PC is simply the best Skyrim version. very nice."

The only thing this edition gives you are some slightly improved textures.ON TOP OF THAT, this edition can't use the same mods that the original edition does. Therefore, you can't access the huge and lively modding community and need to wait for the few modders who care to re-upload their mods for this version.Last but not least, Bethesda is trying to trick consumers by hiding the original version which is still on the steam store.Here it is:http://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/"

,Recommended,489830,31761810,Posted: 14 May,all,凪策,"This is probably the first review I've ever written but I'm doing so to express my frustration with people's opinions of this remastered version. I feel like in the 5 years that this game has been out, people have just gotten lazy and don't do their own research on what's actually being delivered in a game and instead rely on hype and hearsay instead of finding out the details themselves. Secondly, for anyone that has a pair of working eyes (or even one eye), there are a TON of visual changes here and I'm very surprised so many people have not noticed these. I think people just expect to be blown out of their chairs because it's called a ""remaster"" and as such, they develop their own opinions on what it should be and this is wrong.First, Bethesda never promised that the game was going to ""look better"" than your mods. If you watch interviews with Todd Howard and others from the company, you will see that the very reason why they even thought to do a second pass at Skyrim was due to them trying out the Xbox One development kits and needing a game to ""stress"" the system to see what was possible and Skyrim was the game they chose. Liking the results, they decided to make some changes (a complete overhaul was NOT mentioned) and release it as a 64 bit game.This is an incredibly important change. Making a game 64 bit allows the game to exceed the 3.5 gigs of RAM allowed for it. This means the world to the game as a large number of its bugs are due to memory related issues. This also means that when all of your treasured mods are ported over to 64 bit, they will run much better and more stable that they ever have. Lastly, this means that the ""sky"" is the limit (pun) for modders. No longer will memory restrictions be an issue for this game going forward. In my opinion, this is worth the price of admission alone.Now that my rant is over, here is a short list of some of the visual changes I've noticed within my first few hours of play:- Right from the intro scene you can tell that the rock textures on the cliffs have been completely redone. There are much more crags, shadows and details on each one. Cliffs ""feel"" like cliffs now instead of tightly knit triangles they once appeared like. Compare them to the originals yourself if you don't believe me.- Rock textures in caves much clearer.- There is much more ground clutter and the ground textures are sharper.- The foliage is now full and lush and sharper than its ever been. It works very well with the ground clutter to help with the sense of immersion.- Pine tree branches don't seem to have an uprade but the tree trunks most definitely do.- The new depth of field effect looks great and puts a ""focus"" on the object you are closest to and looking at. This looks fantastic with a tree trunk in focus and trees behind appearing soft in the background.- Weather seems to have more frequent changes and I've seen snow in areas I've never seen snow before (Ex: Riverwood).- Rain droplets actually bounce on the water now, a very beautiful effect.- Water shaders have been redone...they aren't amazing but they are definitely an improvement and look great in the distance instead of flat like they used to be.- New shadows...no more striping!!! This is a vast improvement and is something no mod I found every really truly fixed.- The new shadows make interiors look great.- The new lighting, though a bit too bright at times for my tastes, really helps ""morning feel like morning"". Nights are still not as dark as I'd prefer but I know that people will be releasing their own mods for this in the coming months.- The new lighting works very well with the shadows on interiors, however.- Some textures appear to be completely replaced. Ex: Riverwood fencing now appears to be ""weaved"" instead of being made of wood beams like the previous version of the game.- Due to some of the texture changes, the world map now looks different and more detailed.- Anywhere you find text in the game has been drastically improved.- The game is much smoother all around than the previous version and as others have pointed out, the draw distance is great. No doubt that this is due to it being now 64 bit and the memory constraints being lifted.Issues:I've only encoutered two issues in the 11 hours I've played so far and they haven flickering on roofs:- Whiterun's Dragonsreach- the roof of a Honningbrew Meadery location near Whiterun.Closing:I think all of you that are complaining about this version should look a little deeper and stop expecting so much. The very fact that this game is 64 bit means the world to modders and to performance in general. Second, many of you out there got this version for free because you owned the previous one and yet you still complain. People are never happy. I for one am very happy with this version and I can't wait to see what kinds of awesome things modders will come up with in the coming months. Thanks, Bethesda!"

Of course mod-wise there are still some features missing -namely anything that depends on SKSE- but if rumors are true that won't be for the case for much longer. However, the Special Edition modding scene is quite active and prolific as well, and even now, just four months after release, there are mods for pretty much anything. (Some non-SKSE-dependent staples such as Interesting NPCs are still missing though.)Skyrim Special Edition doesn't fix the old bugs and glitches, no, and the USKP team hasn't quite caught all of them yet in SSE. But nonetheless, the 64bit release is a lot less of a hassle than Oldrim because it is very stable even with a large number of mods. In close to 200 hours, I've had a total of five, maybe six crashes on the same machine that got me a crash an hour even with all the 3rd party stability tools like SSME and ENBoost installed (and a crash every 5 minutes before said tools came out).Verdict: If you're wondering whether you should get Oldrim or Newrim - get Newrim, it's catching up fast and comes with a lot less clutter, PLUS it has all the DLCs included already, so no more checking whether a mod requires Dawnguard or Dragonborn or Hearthfire before you install it. 10/10, would let a Giant bludgeon me into space again."

It uses enough to run vanilla Skyrim at 60 FPS (which the game is hard capped to)However, if you try to use any graphical mods whatsoever, the game will have issues staying at 60 FPS. Probably because it refuses to use more than 30% of my GTX 1080TI's power.It's extremely annoying to get the game upgraded to 4k via the mods (back when they weren't paid, anyway) and then have it run at no higher than 40 FPS, even though only 30% of your graphics card is being used.DON'T GET THIS GAME."

I have a number of problems with it.First, they left up the news article announcing that you'd get this for free if you owned all three DLC long after the offer expired.  I bought Hearthfire expecting that I'd get this for free, only to find out that the offer expired last year.  You don't see that bit from the portion of the article visible on the store page.Second, they made the trees prettier, and made a few nicer texture maps, but they left the character generator alone- people look exactly the same.  Animations are the same.  People will still stand with their necks turned 90 degrees while talking to you.Third, the thing is riddled with bugs, some from the old version, some new.  Door stops working after someone walks through it?  Check.  Khajiit corpses wave their tails, check.  Kicked out of vendor dialog if you don't click on the exact pixel for the category you're looking for?  Check.This ""Special Edition"" is basically a way for Bethesda to get back into the role of controling Mods, as far as I can tell.  You can now go to their websire, click the mods you want, and they appear in the game.  That's the only significant change I've seen.  And you'll be grateful for that, because the game is very broken, and the mods can patch it up.But wait- couldn't you have done that with the regular edition?  Yes, yes you could.So if you're buying Skyrim for the first timke, sure, go ahead and get this.If you already own Skyrim, this is not worth it.Forgot to mention, the game is crashing to desktop- which didn't happen to me in the original game.

Speaking of which SE edition breaks many essential mods painstakingly made for Skyrim, and thus only usuable with the original.If you want to play Skyrim unmodded and then forget it, and expense is of no issue, sure buy the SE version here. Otherwise grab the original and make it better then SE can be, even modded, as many essential mods are now exclusive to the original version.Also worth noting that Bethesda will be re-implementing yet another version of their ""paid for mods"" shop. Despite their assurances paid for mods, intended to be exclusive to paying users, have in fact already copied for free. In a further ironic observation, it's rather clear that they will stoop to re-engineering free mods into paid copies. It's a fiasco, same as last time, but now with twice the stupid of the leading brand. In the end the choice is really - Original with loads of mods for free but requires one to learn how to deal with mods; or Skyrim SE with limited or paid for mods, good luck with that."

Along with rants and such on twitter, that just show his inabililty to think like a reasonable human.Bethesda has proven to everyone that all they are is a company, remember when game developers used to make games out of passion and creativity? Yeah, I do too. But it seems that the gaming companies who used to be known for passion projets are now nothing but money hungry goblins who'll do anything to make more money they don't need.By adding paid mods to a game not at all meant for microtransactions and claiming it's not paid mods; Bethesda has not only tarnished it's reputation to those who were unaware of their issues and constant lies, but took the best game they've made in the past decade, and made it into a re-skinned, microtransactioned mess.Bethesda, I know I'm late to the party in saying this.

This is supposed to be a remake/remaster but the devs seem to not care about fixing anything. The textures look like they simply used ""Canvas Size"" in Photoshop and called it a day. Sometimes, you won't be able to complete a quest because you did something, such as raiding a bandit camp. The NPCs have routing issues and will sometimes get stuck. When I kill a rat, the model freezes and I won't be able to take its loins. The story is generic and the characters are bland. You kill a dragon and the people go, ""Congratulations!"" When your game gets corrupted, you have to restart all your progress, make a new game, and sit through the unskippable tutorial mode.

(I've accumulated almost 500 hours of original Skyrim on my own and my bf pc's. So for the boso thinking it's funny 1.4 hrs of SSE isn't accurate.)  Skyrim is the deserved starting place of it all and holds my utmost respect, her flaws are easily over shaddowed and mostly forgiven my humble opinion.Skyrim/SSE (vanilla) is a great game, wondering through the beautiful world with your historic weapons and your sturdy (sometimes too noble!) steed, while npc's go about their business, doing whatever you like! (Some people don't like free rein though?).    Anyway once you have done everything (or at least tired), when you come back for more (and you probably always will) it makes you become creative in developing your character's story, with each new character becoming better. I really appreciate that you get to make your own person, it give is a more personal touch, that's YOUR person, not some random guy you playing with.Skyrim isn't known for having the best story out there  among a lot of people (I love it though!) BUT it allows you actually to be more ingaged with the story you created ! Which makes it exciting thinking about how to go about your game and you might be faced with quests or simple tasks that go against your characters morals?, or maybe not !! (Easliy can become a game. changer with the expanse of mods).This game offers the amazing possibility of Modding your game to improve all aspects (THANKS Bethesda!!). In no way does it make the game lesser, only greater for its potential and is a good... investment therefore worth ever cent if you make the most of it!!Which is really only possible thanks to the awesome guys in the modding community. This is another aspect which I think is great all by itself. Although it can be very time consuming, reading a ton of stuff trying to get your game exactly how you like it and lots of trial and error, the reward of playing a game that was originally fantastic (especially since it isn't new (so be forgiving and not so critical!) and has obviously has stood the test of time)  is now  out of this world and full of new possibilities! (sigh! after you checked your system capabilities though :/   )The feeling of achievement after you have struggled at first, now having a awesome game exaclty how you like it, that you kinda played your own part in creating!! that has been eventually (takes time if you are a beginner learning) modded PROPERLY (did I mention tons of reading and trial and error!!!) is immense,  you will be smiling from ear to ear !!!!My review is for both but in terms of mods mainly for Skyrim Original (vast selections of mods) but essentially SSE too ! We just have to be patient with SSE, its work in progress and her potential is greater than that of original!I hope my review instills excitement if this is the class of game you looking for!"

,Not Recommended,489830,30043816,Posted: 19 February,all,Pax,"Big Skyrim fan since it came out but nonetheless nothing changed with the Special edition.To counter some of the so called positives in the game:- Graphics: Graphics are better than vanilla, but not in the slightest worth the 60 bucks they charge for it. Modders have already created a much more beautiful skyrim than this so called special edition. (Granted I got it for free but I'm talking about the whole picture here.)- Optimization/Performance: Let me start by giving you my specs gtx 1080 Oc'ed - i5 4690k OC'ed- 16gb ddr3 ram - 144hz monitor (2560x1440). My main problem with the vanilla version is that (understandably) any refresh rate above 60hz wasn't supported (again, understandable given at that time there wasn't much above 60hz). Now once I started up the SE it was still buggy like crazy, not talking about water flickering buggy but talking about horse going batshit crazy buggy. Patches came out saying they made optimization fixes for the 144hz display which in my opinion didn't change anything. For some kind of reason I can't even play past 60fps anymore (Yes I disabled Vsync, yes I changed the right Ini files, yes I altered the nvidia cp, yes I did everything I could think of and no I'm not new to this) conclusion: still runs like crap (not so much like unplayable, but more like the same crap the vanilla skyrim played at.)- Sounds: You all know the whole audio fiasco surrounding Skyrim SE I'm not even going any further into it.- Patches/fixes: Takes them months to come out with patches, when they do come out they'll be vague like we are used to from Bethesda games. and won't really change the more important bugs or problems.Verdict: Is it a fun game? Yes it's skyrim, for me it was one of the best games there was until recently. Is it worth it's money today ? Not at all, It is the same game as the one released in 2011. This is a blatant money grab, not spending any time on the game but still raking in the cash. Keep in mind that this is coming from a huge Skyrim fan. I always wished that Bethesda wouldn't turn into what is becoming a trend among developpers but only time could prove that I was wrong, If you can, buy the vanilla version, mod you game to the max and enjoy a truly special experience, but don't encourage this kind of behavior from developpers."

Most of the systems at work in the game are rock solid and anything that isn't has been modded to fix the issue (although I can't talk about it too much since I typically don't use mods in games).The game drops you into a world that has a deep history and lore weaved gracefully through out it.  There is never nothing to explore, even though I have completed all the achievments I have not even come close to finishing all the content the game has to offer.  My 178 hours in the game is only associated with a single character/run of the game.  It is seemingly endless content.The game controls fine as far as combat, but the non-modded version has massive flaws when it comes to inventory management as well as some of the crafting menus.  It was purely built for consoles and they didn't create a seperate inventory system for the PC version.  I would give it a 4.5/5... and highly recommended to anyone who hasn't played it."

Morrowind was by far the best open world RPG you could get. Oblivion had already elements making it a less hardcore rpg (especially fast travelling) while skyrim is clearly a console game and not a pc one... The in-game menus are terrible, good for consoles i guess, but lack of several elements to give a clear view of your toon and achievements.As for the game itself, you can still wonder around, with all the limitations required by the ""community"" (you cant kill important characters like in Morrowind, where you were warned but could still do it) and get loads of quests. But the gaming experience isnt that RPG like the old games of the series.Anyways, it is still a highly recommend title, with the flaws of our time.... Pity that only graphics seem to get better with time, but the overall gaming experience is made for occasional players mostly at this point. I hope they remaster Morrowind somehow. That was the ultimate open world experience. But in the meantime, this can be a decent substitute."

I waited for the summer sale, desperate for a sale on Skyrim and boom, here it was. Special Edition comes with the remastered visuals of the original Skyrim, and of course the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn DLCs. Seeing that the DLCs along cost $45, the 50% off deal for it was great. Now that that's all covered I'll talk about the game.Skyrim:You're the Dragonborn, kill dragons save the world, on top of that level your character by honing different skills, and collect rare weapons scattered throughout the world, there are so many quests, it will be hard to finish them all. The vanilla game by itself is pretty fun. Also, mods make the world a better place.Dawnguard:Vampires are attacking Skyrim, and you can either fight against them with the Dawnguard, or fight alongside the vampires to like you know do vampire things. A lot of new armor and weapons, and also the best follower in the game at your side. Good storyline, and allows multiple playthroughs so you can have one with the Vampires, and one with the Dawnguard.Hearthfire:The cheapest DLC, doesn't add any storylines or quests, but you can build your own house, which is VERY time consuming but rewarding, you can adopt a child and force them to do chores. This DLC adds more of a role-playing aspect to the game if you're into that kind of stuff.Dragonborn:This DLC is arguably the best one in the game. It adds an entirely different region onto your game, Solstheim. With a whole bunch of extra quests and places to explore, this adds even more playtime to the original game which is awesome. The main quest is really interesting and you fight against the cultists who conspire to kill you. This adds a whole bunch of new armors and potions to your game.If you read through all of this, thanks for reading and I hope it was helpful for your decision to purchase the game. If you do, you won't regret it. But until Elder Scrolls VI comes out, I'm gonna be playing Skyrim up to that moment. (It's not happening anytime soon lol Bethesda)"

I tried doing so and wasn't too impressed with the mods, but that's likely due to my lack of knowledge of them.

The original is great and this one isn't bad. the biggest issue is SKSE (Used for modding the game), lack of fixing (all the bugs are still there) and paid mods.Now Sure, this is more of a graphics and ""more optimised"" version of skyrim (like more enemies can fight at once) and constantly goes on sale which in turns makes this cheaper than the original title. I'm persoanlly enjoyng mods from nexus and a very very very limited amout of mods from bethesda due to not being on nexus. (Nexus makes things easier in terms of managing my 100+ active mods plus generally higher quality mods.)The Biggest issue here is the creation club. It's Horse armor all over again and it has the same issues as the horse armor. They ask too much for too little. If You don't know, this is a popular subject in terms of paid mods where in oblivion you could pay for horse armor. It was good in terms of content but in price-wise and what we got didn't match. Same here becasue for what i've seen, paid mods are no more than mods we have for the most part. I don't mind microtransactions as long as they don't take away anything from my main experience or is needed for I realize that companies need money to keep adding new content but the issue here is that they aren't.Creation club isn't really welcomed in the beginning and for good reason, but if they would of used this as a platform for big quality mods that are more overhauls more than anything, I wouldn't have an issue and im pretty sure most would start to accept it if that were the case. But instead of epic mods that makes the civil war a true ""live"" war, boats/battles in the sea, new contenents, oblivion in Skyrim Engine, what we have is simple armor mods, weapons, maybe a quest here and there. We already have plenty of these and the free mods have a tendency to be more thought out where you have to fight for it in some certain location with lore attached while paid mods just give you the stuff.If you enjoyed Skyrim, this is a good buy. If you want to mod your game to no limit then go for the original. The sad truth here is that bethesda is trying to exploit the one thing that made their games amazing. Mods. Their games are mediocer at best for they are generally a buggy mess. Sure I enjoy some of their games but if this game wasn't moddeble as it is, then people would just forget their games. To me it seems like they are heading down a road that they may not come back from. So here's to hoping that if they get enough feedback, they will stop this or at least make the paid mods worth it."

The graphical development for this reboot is incredible and the engine is even better! I love the game more than most games that I have ever played and I've only owned it for a short amount of time. If you enjoy roleplaying games, this is most definitely the game for you! There are so many options in the game as to what you can do that it's insane. I'm in love with it so far, it's a must play at some point! The story is insane, gameplay is great, and everything about it is amazing! If you liked any of Bethesda's other works, this is just as incredible if not more! One of Bethesda's best roleplaying games, I strongly recommend that you try it!-Kyle James"

,Not Recommended,489830,33163477,Posted: 2 July,all,ChaoxShadow,"When a company remasters a game, what you're looking at is the differences between the original and the remastered version. This one pukes on efforts for a multitude of reasons.First, is the idea of Creation Club or what is more commonly referred to as ""paid mods"". In tandem to it, Bethesda made it so that the original The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can't be easily found on the Steam dispository without direct linking. Even better is that the Legendary Edition bundle which includes all the DLC has gone with it.For lower end PC players it's a slap in the face, especially with the new system requirements far outstripping the original. What would've made this remastered edition perfect was if their minimum matched or at least came close to having options for low graphic gameplay because for all I know, no player wants a slideshow gameplay.Next are the glorious mods. If you want to know why Skyrim stayed afloat among the gaming community it's because of this. Mods became the essence of what made Skyrim and kept players playing or returning. However the remastered edition, as it probably should, breaks a huge majority of the catalog of mods for the original. With the fate of SKSE for the 64bit system that the Special Edition is hoisting up has been delayed, last news seen in early April. if you're a returning player coming for the ability to further push the limits and turn this game into a groaning beast of burden with all the mods that you've been hauling on top of the original game, those prospects will have to, unfortunately, wait.For base gameplay, yes, the game is an ace in the hole with added saturation but that Metacritic score of ~75 up there? It's there and stark yellow for a reason. Don't get this version, or at least consider deeply before you do so.My opinion is that you wait it out and see if Bethesda brings back the original version (and the Legendary Edition bundle) on sale. There are mods that can easily replicate the effects of the Special Edition's remastered qualities without overburdening your computer with the original version. For those avid modders, all I need to say is that ~1400 pages of mods are a big thing to miss out on.TL;DR, for someone with a relatively good setup and lack of modding background, take a shot if you can't get a hold of the original, ideally on sale (at least 50%).If you've played the original version before, this game barely passes the recommendation phase if you take it with (several) grains of salt. It only pushes the boundaries in which you can force the game to go aside from a few additions which are majorly for convenience sake.If you've got a low end pc (check the system requirements!) and/or love the modding of the original version, look away from this abomination. It's not worth the time in the slightest. Or at least until SKSE comes out if you really can't stop yourselves and it's on sale."

Given that it gives no advantages other than to fix bugs I thought that achievements would have no issue still working with this patch. That however is not the case! Given the fact that this game is so old and Bethesda is still milking it ie: GOTY Edition back a while, the special Edition, bringing it to Switch and also VR, I don't see why they have not invested into fixing some of these game breaking bugs.

I'm not trying to bash Bethesda seeing that I like their company and games, but you would expect them to be able to fix the issues when it comes to texture especially with an old game like Skyrim, with players still daily enjoying and playing the game and mods coming out for it weekly. The thing that made me mad the most was the fact that I was able to handle Fallout 4, a more complex and newer game than Skyrim, especially when it comes to texture issues, now you would say that, ""Of course, it's a new game, they would already have upgraded everything for the players preformace."" Yes I understand that, but the fact of the matter is the tiniest of issues that could be fixed with what they know is still a popular game, isn't being done when it should be. Skyrim is a great game and I have played it in great quality on gaming consoles such as the Xbox One, and not once have I had a issue with major texture glitches and failures right in the beginning of the game. I wanted to see the game in the best of quality and I was thinking using my $16,00 custom made gaming computer would do the trick, but I guess not. There are still issues that NEED to be fixed, and I have tried everything from doing what steam recommends to what other people from other sites think what can be done, but to no progress, I was still stuck in the same position as I was playing a great game with poor and glitchy quality."

,Recommended,489830,29864429,Posted: 11 February,all,Ianous,"Just like the original, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition holds this special feeling in the hearts to those who play. Whether it be the first dungeon you are exploring or your hundreth, Skyrim captivates and enthralls. I had a save file of the original on the Playstation 3 when I was a console♥♥♥♥♥with almost 700 hours worth of play time allocated, and I desired to do more. The one problem with this game is the lack of total mod support from the original, however the SKSE development team should be done porting their script extender (which is vitally important to a multitude of mods on the original) so this issue will be fixed in a few months. However, this review should not be based on mod support but, rather, the vanilla game it self. Skyrim holds perhaps one of the greatest ambient soundtracks I have heard in a very long time, so you actually feel slightly immersed into this fantasy world. The visual redevelopment for the Special Edition to improve the graphical capabilities of the game is astounding to those whom don't use mods, there is a clear difference between the original and this. If I were a reporter for a company such as Game Informer I would rate this version of the game at a 8.75 on a 10 scale, the Main and DLC (which are included in the special edition) storylines are wonderful, however for a majority of quests it seems as if you need to go somewhere, kill this, find that, and these side quests become dry after a while. Do not let that discourage you, however, because there are many quests that aren't like that, and these types of quests allow you to become a part of the world and discover locations. Another issue that prevents a 9 or 10 rating is the bugs. Lets face it, Bethesda has a problem with debugging. Despite a massive amount of updates for both versions of the game and there being two versions of the same game bugs are still existent. Some of these bugs can be game breaking, so that subtracts from the total score. Another issue is the scaling. At 15th level or so bandits feel a little easier but it isn't as noticable because you are now fighting some more advance enemies, however at 70th level with fully upgraded and enchanted dragon armor a bandit in fur armor with a iron sword is simply a unhanded punch to death. For some, however, this feeling of overpoweredness is outstanding and loved. For others, not so much. In conclusion of my extremely long and probably worthless review,10/10 ign."

No other fantasy RPG games kept me playing on and on and on and on while the games just kept giving... Make no mistake, the hours that are put in my gaming experience concerning Skyrim do not include another non-steam dvd version I have been playing without the DLC before this. So make that 300+ hours at least.Skyrim seems superior to me out of all Elder Scrolls games. Yes, I know, the atmosphere and story in Morrowind are awesome too. This however does not take away the immersion I personally have experienced in Skyrim. I felt as if I became part of the world and believe me, not all RPG games do that for me. The small details, from hearing and seeing a waterfall in a cave, stumbling across a secret location to the freezing mountains and being able to really make it your game. The publisher does not force you to do anything and the greatest moments are to be had when you simply explore. Never, ever did I browse through a walkthrough or guide, as this felt like my adventure across this huge world and not some generic plot. I really felt the attention and love Bethesda put in this game.Some people are of the opinion that the story is not good enough (especially the main quest). I however had most fun from not following the main quest and really exploring. Moreover, some classics like Morrowind have a certain nostalgic memory to them as they were ahead of their time. You can never top that nostalgic memory, believe me. Morrowind is great in it's own right and should be deemed as such. I love all Elder Scrolls games (except for ESO since I am not very much into the MMO element). Still, Skyrim is my favourite.Other people are bugged by the bugs ( no pun intended ;-) ). I myself have experienced only one annoying bug with the patched version to be honest, so no...it did not break the game for me.The inventory system is somewhat of a downer to me though, as it feels like a direct port from console versions, but this is also easily fixed with mods. Which brings me to something else, the modding community for this game is amazing! If you get this game and ""complete"" it, you should really check it out.Basically, this game is worth your time, as it has so many ""whoaa"" moments. Go for it!"

Needless to say I was extremely excited and had high hopes for the Special Edition coming out. Seeing all the bad and mixed reviews the game got almost made me second guess it and not buy the game, luckily I went with my gut and trusted Bethesda. Takes me back 5 years ago to launch night and seeing it for the first time! I think all the people having issues must have subpar PC builds. Im running an i5 6600 with an MSI GTX 960 4GB and 8GB of RAM, which is pretty good and I run most games in Ultra50+, but it's obviously no i7 and  NVIDIA 10 series (yet). My point being, it doesnt even take a super build to run the game smoothly. Skyrim SE runs in Ultra 60 nearly 100% of the time for me. I rarely experience fps drops below 55fps, my GPU's recommended for Ultra in this game which looks like quite the improvement from original skyrim. Even in high action scenes or densely populated towns, 60fps. I think they did a gret job with this game, it's my first time playing it on PC (originally on xbox360) and I'm having a blast. Everything looks incredible and this game is just as exciting as I remember and cant wait to rediscover all the great content. 6 Hours into this playthrough and I've had virtually no issues since I booted it, definitely a good purchase!"

While all these games have their pro's and con's they all share in their popularity and not last of all because of lack of modding. In fact the modding aspect is why even morrowind is still being played today despite it's monolithic age. The lifeblood of an elderscrolls game is in it's ability to lay a foundation for which modders can build a better game onto. This in mind I'm reviewing the SE version of the game.While the SE does not do a whole lot in terms of visual improvement apart from adding textures here and there and few shader effects. It's strength lies in the theoretical boost of the 64bit processing power. The reason why I say theoretical is because at launch people suffered from hiccups and mods made it worse sometimes as is to be expected. However the premise for smooth and slick performance is there and gradually the performance has been going up and is getting better all the time. Upon release, due to change in architecture, the mods compatible with original Skyrim were not compatible with SE. This was the great and biggest achilles heel of the SE as the lifeblood of an Elderscrolls game is the modding. I have a theory that Bethesda put as little effort as possible into the SE expecting the mods to be ported and thus eliminating any need for them to do anything else than create a foundation of faster 64bit core of the existing game.This obviously caused a lot of angry and disappointed response from gamers, but from business standpoint what is the point spending a lot of money when the modders are going to basically create a new game for you anyway. So after some time now, is the modding dead or picking up speed? Yes. The amount of mods, especially essential ones, are being ported and the promise of a SE Skyrim is beginning to unfold. The mods that I have installed make Skyrim SE compete with witcher 2 which is nothing short of a miracle from a game from 2012!! The amount of content from missions, locations, gameplay improvements and elements is staggering theoretically. Almost every aspect of the game can be added upon, changed or modified.I have 3d enhanced soundGraphics that look like something in between witcher 2 and 3Solid and mostly smooth performance with almost a hundred mods in place.Tons and tons of new missions, locations, characters, marriable npc's and followersAnimals and survivability mods that add the element of being at the mercy of nature a reality, I can even be hit by a lightning.And the best part of all, The game looks and plays like I want it to! That personal touch of mine is there due to the fact of me being able to choose what kinds of mods to add. Now is the default price worth it for the SE edition? In my opinion no. The amount of work Bethesda put into it warrants only either free, or discounted price. However this does not mean SE is not worth getting, it ABSOLUTELY is, just not for full price. It is and is going to be the most advanced Skyrim experience once it matures and it's already on it's way. I remember the time when my pc was dying from the original Skyrim with the mods.. Just too much power going into running them. Now it's a whole different story and with more advanced shaders giving that extra touch with volumetric lighting and Godrays that certainly add to the atmosphere.It's definitely worth getting if you like rpg's. If you have original Skyrim and are able to run it with all your mods, there is less reason to get this one. It basically only introduces the 64bit operation thus making the amount of mods being able to be run theoretically much more snappy. Also bear in mind that any game that allows modding, rarely suits for those with short attention span or lack of experience with modding. There are countless of hours being spent to make sure all mods are compatible with each other and getting them installed properly. The end result is well worth it and the feeling of victory when you are staring at a game that has risen from it's ashes looking and playing like a modern gaming masterpiece is like a first kiss experience!"

Everyone here was expecting graphic imporvements for example, and you have others who are writing bad reviews due to lack of mods being available. Something to note prior to buying the game. This game runs on an 64bit engine which combined with DX11 results in a much more enjoyable experience, especially if you're one of the people who play with a heavily modded game. So now we have a more stable environment to play in which is beautiful! However, keep in mind there's currently less mods available as they're still being ported over. Another thing to consider is mods now deactive achievements from being earned (This can be fixed with a mod).Overall you should honestly get this version of Skyrim over the GOTY version."

I'm a huge fan of Open-world games and thought I would try skyrim again (I played like 6 hours on my Xbox 360 about 3 years ago and haven't played it since) and I can say it was one of the best $20 (from the sale) I've ever spent. I didn't think I would like the game, since it seems like with these kinds of games I get really bored with easily, but I was wrong. There's so much to do and its so action-packed that it could keep any video game lover interested. I completed the main storyline quest and quite a few of the side quests and I can safely say I'm 70% done with the game. What I've found in the game are a few bugs, which could get pretty annoying at times. Like one time, I had no idea there was an option to change your difficulty so I messed around with that, and somehow after switching it back to Adept it put it at Legendary. I had no idea why the game all of a sudden got so hard, but then I went into settings and found that and pretty much just facepalmed. There are a lot more bugs that I've discovered but don't think I need to list.So do I recommend this game? Hell yeah. If you like open world games with a lot of adventure and action then you'll love this game. I can't wait to spend 200 more hours (apparently it takes 300 hours to complete and I have 100) of my life finishing this game and not doing something productive, woo! Lmao but seriously, it's worth the $40. Besides the bugs, I've enjoyed this game so much and it's definitely one of my most favorite games ever and I can't wait to complete it.P.S: I haven't used any mods yet since I've been waiting to complete the game. I saw some pretty nasty stuff written about it in the negative reviews and don't know what that's all about. I assume there's some problems with it, but I don't think it's worth leaving a negative review because of it. Guess I'll find out lol."

Little snowflakes floated quietly and the wind blew very gently around me. There was almost no sound at all, it was like a dream. This Place was not ruined by a man ever before, I was very first human who had entered here.A deep paralyzing scream rang suddenly form the sky and I almost fell from the icy mountain top. I turned around quickly as I could and looked at the direction where that racking sound came from. Then I saw it, a huge black creature with burning eyes flying towards me. It flew rapidly against me and breathed fire at the same time. Fiery shock wave knocked me out of balance and i was cast out from the mountain peak. I fell along the steep slopes of the mountain and I felt like my whole body was one big mass of chopped flesh. I could not breathe, everything was blurry and I realized I was dying soon. Then, everything stopped, I was not falling anymore. I was laying at blood covered snow and my head was like as if it had been beaten to the wall. The pain was infernal and eventually I passed out.That is a tiny piece of story what could happen in Skyrim Special Edition. It is a different world and once you step in, there is no turning back. You loose yourself, everything around you will vanish and you rematerialize in the world of adventures! It is very hard to come back from there. But hey, we all want to travel in spectacular places and we want to experience amazing things in our lives. With this game it is all possible, just sit down and take a good relaxing position. Then you are ready for adventure of life time. We all dont have affor for expensive road trips or holiday vacation in Hawai etc, but with 40€/$ you will get a quest like no other.

Now we just need to wait until modders make extremely good looking graphics mods. In Skyrim 2011 you can download mods to make it look better than this Special Edition with mods. Only a matter of time til the tables turn. This has good graphics without mods but with a good PC why wouldn't you like them better. The sound quality is probably the biggest dissappointment in this game. The sounds sound low quality compared to the original Skyrim. Otherwise a great game.

Whole new environments, graphical upgrade and all DLC pre-included, for a price more than fair. So I am going to break it down :First off, I received this product for free, due to having already collected all that it includes in the previous version. But financially speaking, buying Skyrim + all DLC would cost you a price of 60. Quite the discount is what you get with Special Edition as you pay only 40 for the same exact product. But with a 2016 graphical and processing upgrade.Second off, gameplay is the same as the first game, but includes options like hold or toggle for certain actions, that the original lacked. After that its the amazing open world of Skyrim ready to be explored... until your reach the borders.""How much more immersive does it feel than the original?"", truth be told, the new FX and details added here and there( mostly inspired by mods like climates of Tamriel, truth be admitted and told ) are making the world of Skyrim way more immersive. Another thing is, originally Skyrim came out in 2011, when Flat Screens were not as popular, so it did not come packed with a full flat screen support, Special Edition IS FLAT SCREEN ONLY, if you want to work 100% fullscreen and desktop fullscreen. But seeing the current market, I don't believe that applies as a problem to most.Now, the only negative I could find ( except the typical Bethesda bugs/crushes ) was Bethesda's new modding license and achievement progression, see they allow you to use console commands to attain godly power in second if you wish. But they forbid you to save on the same file if you add a single mod, no matter what that is ( even fixes ). Although, modders have found a workaround to that as well. Now I would not much mind about that for any other game, BUT, Skyrim is a game that not only build a huge part of its fame around mods, but also refined and forged a modding community that Bethesda should be more than proud of. I am honoured to call some of those great modders my friends and I always envy their talent in creating art... or derpness, that I can use for my enjoyment. Then again, although the percentages are not nearly equal, there is a somewhat considerable amount of questionable mods for the game, so that is the only way which I understand Bethesda's policy on mods... Still better than Sony's policy on mods, I mean lack of mods ( ba dum tss ).Long story short : If you loved Skyrim and did not have the DLC, if you never experienced Skyrim or if you truly love the game. Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim Special Edition is an opportunity I would highly NOT advice you to let go.Thanks for your time, hope you found this helpful and if you are a fellow player of the game : Why are you here?

Everything I tried didn't work.

I'll be able to play, since on the lowest settings it looks like a normal game should, but buying the new computer just to play this game is stupid. You do not get extra content with this version than just buying the original game and its DLC. It just ""makes the game look better"", or crash more often.

The story, gameplay, graphics, everything about it made me enjoy it every single bit. However, how Bethesda has been treating this game as of lately is totally unacceptable. As of this year, Skyrim will turn six years old and it has aged fairly well. Bethesda, however, just isn't helping it age.Creation club. I had fairly mixed reviews when they first announced this but didn't think of it much at first. Now I'm starting to despise it. After a while, they purposely try to hide the original game off of Steam. Let me be honest, any or all of the paid mods offered by Bethesda's creation club are mostly cosmetic only. (I.e New weapons, reskins, etc,). Now that's not bad per say, but Bethesda is constantly trying to shove it down our throats.Dont get me wrong, this game is good. It is great. Everything about it is done excellently. I'm only giving a bad review on Bethesda's behalf and their actions within the past few months. The fact they're adding a ""paid"" survival mode makes it even worse. All it essentially does is add basic survival needs to the game. Like hunger, thirst, adding campfires. The thing is, there arePLENTYof free mods that do this and work for Special Edition. I'm willing to bet these mods might even make the survival aspect better. One mod that does this is the well madeiNeed - Food Water and Sleep from Isoku.Please note at the time or making this review, SKSE64 has been released and is in it's alpha state. Use at your risk. It's been doing well from my own experience. For anyone who doesn't know, SKSE64 is the ""SKSE"" for special edition, made specially for it and it's 64-bit engine.

If I like the work some modders put into their mod, I CAN GIVE THEM A DONATION AND ENDORSEMENT! MODS SHOULD BE FREE UNLESS YOU FEEL THE NEED TO THROW MONEY AT IT!!Your not fooling the gamers Bethesda. Credits to 'Purchase' mods. BUY MORE CREDITS SO YOU CAN GET MODS! Doesn't matter how you sugarcoat it. It's still buying the mod.Survival mode. Yeah spend 5-6 hundred credits on it. I have my own freaking survival mode. It's call Camping, Frostfall, Wildcat and Ineed. AND I GOT IT FOR FREE BECAUSE NEXUS MODDERS ARE GOOD PEOPLE and don't force the consumer to pay real money for that mod.I can get nearly everything in the store from Nexus, and more.Paid mods sounds even more scummy than DLC. The thing is, your getting charged a lot more for essentially one thing.Aside from ranting. I have to recommend Skyrim it's just an amazing, atmospheric world that bleeds immersion.If you have never played Skyrim, go and play it.Never played Oblivion? Go and play it.Morrowind? same thing. Go play it.But if your a veteran like me, you need mods. Once you go with mods, there's no turning back.My game has over 115 mods  ALL FREE!!!!! FROM NEXUS!! And I absolutely love it.I don't know what's in store with Creation Club. I just don't care at all. But it had BETTER not interfere with my mods list.Don't ruin what love and admiration I have left for you Bethesda. Get rid of paid mods, prove your not greedy and giving Nexus the finger.I realize this review is voted negative. I'm NOT downvoting the game. NOT AT ALL!! Please read and understand that. It actually hurts me inside to put that negative on it. :(I'm downvoting Paid Mods in General. I'm voting for the people. For the modders. For gaming companies.Horrible buisness practices are practiced today, it's all just about the freaking money and no one cares about the loyal fans, and the average consumer.Screw paid mods. I have my Nexus, I don't need to waste my money just from buying one armour set.What happened to you Bethesda? You used to be so golden."

76561198054993096,Recommended,489830,30221604,Posted: 27 February,all,turtlecat,"Skyrim is not a good game. It's horribly buggy and unstable. For a game with such expansive lore and potential, the game tells a shallow story often times. The combat is extremely simplistic and the difficulty is amped up by making enemies into damage sponges.I'm a firm believer in that a good game does not need mods. This game does. Not only to expand upon the graphics, but the stability of the game as well. To make the game into something great you basically have to overhaul the whole thing with mods. The community around the game, however, does an amazing job with this- but should it really have to be that way? Shouldn't the devs be taking their time and trying their best to make the game the best it can be? It almost feels like they rushed this game out because they know the title and the company's name alone will sell it.Considering all this, Skyrim is still one of my favorite games. Maybe even _the_ favorite. Even though I know a game polished to diamond quality like the Witcher 3 is far superior. Why is this?Skyrim spurs my imagination. It's a magical, immersive open world. It was the first game I'd ever experienced to capture me in this way. I can spend my time being a backstabbing, sneaky archer magic wielding cat making my derpy follower haul loot out of dwemer ruins. I can make it my mission to collect all of Skyrim's cabbages and store them in my basment. I can immerse myself in the, when looked at with a critics eye, silly storylines and be the last Dragonslayer of old- the biggest hero since Tiber Septim himself. I can be whoever I want to be.I've collectively spent over a thousand hours in Skyrim, enjoying every second, and I still haven't even completed the DLC.  I realize this game will never be as good as it gets praise for, and I almost feel guilty for enjoying it more than the amazing game that is Witcher 3, but I can't help myself. I love it. I love Skyrim. If you've by chance never played it, go play Witcher 3 instead."

,Recommended,489830,29819877,Posted: 10 February,all,Ser Williamson,"Foreword: Please note that I received this game for free, as part of Bethesda's program where they gave owners of the old Skyrim +DLC (henceforth known as ""Oldrim"") the SE (we'll call this ""SSE"") version for nothing.Now, please excuse the lack of hours recorded on this version as I primarily play Oldrim due to the available mods (which we will go over).So right off the bat, we will look at pro's and con's and then other considerations as to whether this is worth it (vs Oldrim).I will also go into this assuming that you are familiar with Skyrim in general by this point.Pro's:Updated Engine.64-bit - Should have far less memory related issues.Stability does feel massively improved, although there is a specific issue present when using the Unofficial Patch which can result in the intro sequence bugging out.Very stable framerate.Some graphical updates - For better or worse you have the option of Godrays and the lighting is generally improved. Mods can make Oldrim look just as good and definitely better - That being said, a lot of those same mods are now available for SSE.All DLC is included.In-home streaming works wonders.Con's:A lot of old bugs still present (you need to use the Unofficial Patch to fix a lot of this).SKSE is not yet available, so complex mods do not yet exist, not so much of a fault of Bethesda - but be aware of this.As to the above, Bethesda have not included new scripting hooks or added any of the additional functionality SKSE provided over the years - To be honest, it would have been nice if Bethesda had implemented some of these functions but I understand why they didn't.UI is still terrible, but I hardly expected that to be changed. It is okay if you are using a controller, but we really need something like SkyUI to be fully ported. If SkyUI is not ported we will be left in the water until someone comes along and makes something.TXAA seems like a blurry mess and gives me nausea - This was a super easy thing to resolve (changed to FXAA, others may want to turn AA off entirely). Your mileage may vary with this.Thoughts:As to whether I recommend this, overall I would say absolutely yes - But it also depends on where you are coming from.If you already have Oldrim and you were given this for free it simply comes down to two questions:Q:Have I currently got Oldrim set up to the point it is very stable and how I like it?A:If you answeryesthen there honestly isn't much of a point jumping to SSE. If Oldrim is working fine, looks great and has all the content you want then you won't gain anything by jumping to SSE. If you have stability issues though and are willing to make some sacrifices then it could be worth it.Q:Do I currently rely on mods such as SkyUI (or others that need SKSE) to have an enjoyable game?A:If you answer yes to the above, then again you should stick to Oldrim as SKSE won't be ported until March (soon). We don't know how long until it is stable either, as this will be a Beta release. At this stage, I believe I heard the SkyUI author/s have no plans to port it - But someone likely would.Now, if you own Oldrim but for whatever reason did not get SSE (did not own all the DLC during the promotion window for example) you need to consider if upgrading is worth it. At this stage I would probably say no to be honest. If you now own all the DLC you can just mod yourself a game that will look and run just as nice. Though SSE may have an edge in stability (the lightning effects are very nice to be fair too).If you don't own either then it is a tougher call. Go have a look at mod lists and collections. See what is around. Now, check which ones are available for SSE vs Oldrim. If the ones you like are available (or have plans to be made available) for SSE it may be a good idea to go straight to that. However, if it looks like it needs to be Oldrim that is not the most horrid decision you could make (there are many more mods available for it in general).If you are on the fence however, and are not hugely concerned about the mod side of things, then SSE may be the way to go. It is newer, more stable and to be honest it is easier to make it look nice.In Oldrim, STEP will drive you mad (but give great results) - In SSE I had a lot of luck getting a great looking game by just hopping onto the nexus site and going down theTop Ratedlistings. I don't even have an ENB running yet in SSE and it looks very nice.So the TL;DR:Oldrim = More immediate content + years of community work. Can look great but needs some reasonable effort to keep stable. More complex mods.SSE = More stable, easy to make look nice. More limited mod support (but it is growing) and at the time of writing, mostly stuck with a console UI (still not as bad as Fallout 4 though >.>).Hope I didn't confuse you people even more!Current specs (if relevant):CPU: Intel Core i5-3570K @ 3.4GHz (never ended up overclocking)RAM: 8GB DDR3GPU: Zotac 1080 Amp Extreme 8GBResolution: 2560x1440Storage: SSE installed to 2TB 7200RPM HDD, Oldrim installed to 512GB SSDSSE Active ESP's: ~40 (using NMM currently)Oldrim Active ESP's: ~200 (~250 mods in total, using MO for organisation - Using STEP Core + Extended as a base platform for mods)"

Skyrim SE has some remarkably poor gameplay mechanics for a 2011/2016 release, so I really cannot recommend it. I'd rather play Dragon Age: Inquisition, which has some horrible gameplay mechanics in similar regards (UI, menu navigation, controls, movement, mapping/radar, combat), than this game.A real shame (and waste of money).Edit: P.S.

In bethesda's credit they have ventured and battled for the concept (now reality) of mods on console, although these mods will never amount to the ubsurdity nor creativity that you can find on PC it gives dedicated fans enough to stay happy and entertained. Although i belive this is a great breakthrough they've made a grave mistake implemeting their mods system into the PC version (and obviously paid mods, i am not getting into detail with this as you've probably already seen a paragraph about how this is the coming of satan).

After 2012 I stopped playing it. Bought the Special Edition a few months ago. I had not seen any of the new stuff added to the game, so I told myself might as well get everything at once. It was well worth it. I understand the people who have been using mods and been keeping up with the DLC's might not notice much difference. As someone who hasn't played this game since 2012, the Special Edition blew my mind. The graphics on my PC are 100% better then my X-Box 360 version. The surroundings are so beautiful and much more clear. I love standing on top of a mountain looking down at the gorgeous terrain. Spotting a flying Dragon in the distance just makes the view that much better. If you have not played this game in a long time and have not downloaded any new content, then this is the game for you. It gives you all the new missions which are awesome. I think I payed $30. Money well spent I say. I played the game for weeks straight. It was like I was playing it for the first time again.

,Not Recommended,489830,32605387,Posted: 20 June,all,Clorax,"I can't recommend this game. I literally can't do it.You want to know how many times I've TRIED to like this game? I own this game in it's previous version on steam where I have just shy of 30 hours, I also have the PS3 version I got the christmas it came out and I have probably about 50 hours in that as well.I still don't like it.I know this is a game so DEAR to peoples hearts and everybody seems to really like it, but I honestly don't get it! There are so many GLARING problems with this game I can't shake it and I cannot recommend it!Talking about Game Mechanics, it's DREADFUL.The combat system entirely is so SO bad I can't even see how people can get past that! Sword combat is so heavy and then does almost no damage that it feels like you're waving a heavy plastic sword around at enemies. Magic is SO limited, even if you spend your time trying to level up the magic, you get nothing for it, it's almost useless compared to every other combat option from what I can tell, which is a HUGE shame because honestly I found it the most enjoyable part of the game. Archery is really the only viable option and it's the most limited of the lot! You can barely upgrade your arrows and bows, it's all reliant of how you play the game and that itself isn't easy to define.I have tried every combination there is for a character, nothing stuck past that first dragon, it's not fun to do any of them. Stealth is probably the worst component, it's like a vague hint of a stealth system. Fallout 4 also has this sort of stealth system and I don't even know why they thought it worked here enough to port it over! Bethesda can't make a stealth experience in their games! It just doesn't work! Going further, forcing people otherwise to go hand to hand/magic is really the only options left because you just can't use archery if you're going for a more action packed experience, and as I explained earlier, I can't see how people can even get past the GOD AWFUL hand to hand combat system.On top of this, the game introduces a perk system... Well I say introduces, as someone who's first ever experience with a Bethesda game, I really did not enjoy having to figure out exactly how this perk system works by guess work on my first 15 or so tries at this game. It gives you ZERO explanation on what sort of system you want to go for, it's EXTREMELY broad which can be a good thing in some circumstances, but in this I'd say it really confuses new players, people require wiki's or walkthrough's for simple explanations on how each perk benefits a set character you want to create. I'm very happy that Bethesda ended up changing this for Fallout 4, even if it's almost too basic in Fallout 4 I'd honestly take it over Skyrim's system any day.Oh god, then there's the inventory system... in fact ANY interface in this game. It's really hard to find anything, and I don't understand why it's such a small list to scroll through when opening it up. It's almost as if they thought people never look up and so had to have everything in the inventory on the bottom half of the screen. Then there's the map which I will attest to being the worst way to do a map in a video game. You get so lost because you can move the map, there's no set direction or anyway to find out NESW easily when in the map, I find sitting there the 3D map interface just get's in the way and makes things hidden and hard to find. It's like they tried to make the map stylish but forgot that it needs to be functional as well.The map genuinely feels too big. It's so empty that I can't even think of anywhere I'd want to go, there's no ""pick a direction and just walk and you'll find something"" feeling. It's so well illustrated right outside Whiterun, with the huge field with the tower where the first dragon appears. It's empty. There's nothing. And you go beyond that tower and there's just nothing. It's dead, it's more wasteland than Fallout. It's like they thought people liked that TES2 was good because it was the biggest map in history even though 3/4 of it is emptiness because it just randomly generated♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's not the case Bethesda, fill up your game, don't leave it empty. I want to walk 5 minutes and find something, not be rewarded with a tree.I haven't touched upon the story, and that's simply because in the 50 or so times I've tried to enjoy this game I've not gotten far at all! What I can say is that the opening cutscene in Helgen is the longest thing I've ever sat through, it's like 10 minutes for no information what-so-ever. Even when I played it for the first time I found it long and boring and I got nothing out of it, the reveal of a huge ♥♥♥♥ing dragon wasn't a twist, the advertising was teeming with dragons, I didn't expect to not see one.Now the argument I get from people when I bring up these problems is to ""just mod the game!"" and to that advice I have one thing to say: You don't get how a game is meant to be sold do you?Alien: Colonial Marines if a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game. It's broken and filled with empty promised by the people who developed it. There's a mod that let's you play the game, because it's so broken it's virtually unplayable without it. It doesn't change anything, does it? The game itself was sold as a buggy pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and the game still is sitting on the false promised made. It's the exact same thing here.Skyrim is a game that people love. There are GLARING problems, I brought up a lot here but there's definitely more. Just because you can mod some of these problems out, doesn't make the game good. I don't understand how the base game for this can actually get a 9/10. It's not a very good game. Sure, I've had some enjoyable moments in the times I've tried to enjoy the game, but absolutely not enough to justify a 9/10.I'd give Skyrim, in all honesty, a 4 or 5 out of 10. The glaring problems in this game seem to gloss over fan's heads as they mod them away without addressing them as what they are: Problems that Bethesda should've fixed in this Special Edition instead of making the water look a bit better."

However paying £29.99 for a ""special"" edition that only adds lighting and higher resolution textures with no bug fixes at all isn't worth the money. Not to mention the expedential increase in power you need to run this game compared to the Original. On the original skyrim, you could install mods very easily for free and it would look 10 times better than Special Edition, and even run better. Not to mention bethesda hid the original Skyrim on the steam store so people would spend more money tricking people into buying Special Editon. I'm not saying its a bad game because frankly, its one of my favourite games, however it's a scam to release basically the same game with some very minor changes for £29.99."

If you're new to the game, here's a quick history lesson. The original Skyrim had a mod called Skyrim Script Extender. All it did was basically change a bit of the coding so that more complex mods could be produced. Tons of fantastic mods were built upon it. However, when the Special Edition came out the Script Extender was no longer compatible, thus the selection of mods was, and still is, severely limited.The developers of the Script Extender seem to have all but abandoned it. So instead of buying this version, buy the original Skyrim for half the price, and install graphics mods, animation mods, etc. There is nothing Skyrim Special Edition has to offer that the original can't be modified to do better. Unfortunately, Steam has removed it from the search engine, so I'll provide the link for it below.http://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/"

I did find out after I bought the special edition that if you own the original with all the dlc it was a free upgrade. The only thing disappointing about that is most of the mods out are for the original and not the se, and that the original is in a bundle now with all the dlc for less than the special edition.  So, my recommendation, if you don't already have skyrim, its a great game and worth the buy. But as of right now, buy the original bundle, its cheaper (by a few cents), but you get to take advantage of the mods available, and the special edition is available as a free upgrade to those who have the original and all its dlc."

,Recommended,489830,31725037,Posted: 13 May,all,Gallonq,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a RPG officially released on November 11, 2011. This game was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth part in the series The Elder Scrolls.Intro Story:SPOILERS:The story begins when the player wakes up in a convoy of convicted prisoners, including the northern rebel leader Ulfric Stormcloak. Just a moment before your execution a dragon appears, this is the first time a dragon was seen in a couple of hundred years. Because Ulfric is suspected of inhumane forces, everyone thinks that he has something to do with the appereance of Alduin.The dragon attacks the village. But the player succeeds to escape the village trough an underground cave. The player gain's his freedom, he get's introduced to the world. More dragons are seen. Does the player have something to do with this?Although the original game is almost 6 years old, it still feels new. The graphics are okay and with the help of some mods it's actually pretty beautiful. The story and quests never bore you, even if you have played a couple of hundred hours, you will still find new and interesting things around every new corner. I recommend to pick this game up with the 3 DLC, because these keep you busy for another 100 hours.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=788310445Because it's a Bethesda game it does tend to have some little bugs. These bugs do mostly no effects to your gameplay or gamesaves. But it does pull you out of some intense moments and your 'roleplaying' moments.Game breaking glitches do exist but are very rare, these are easy fixable with a bit of help from the World Wide Web.I myself have played over 200 hours on the PlayStation 3 and I don't regret any minute.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition.Skyrim SE, 'sigh.' It had the chance to be really good. But they have srewed over it.It's a shame that some media call this the Skyrim: REMASTERED.It did not fix some really common bugs and the game breaking glitches.The graphics are slightly upgraded but not enough for the REAL NEXT GEN.They could have put some new and interesting factors in the game, but they didn't.But still... I prefer Skyrim: SE over Skyrim.Why?There is only 1 thing I think that was a really GOOD upgrade, and that is: thehttps://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim. They made it much easier to mod your game, if you are lazy like me: you too will appreciate skyrim SE. You don't have to learn things like Nexus Modding, you don't have to download random stuff.Just have an Bethesda account and make sure that everything is in the right load order, easy right?I hope my review was helpful, and I hope I helped you with making the best decision!<3 Jonas"

However, after completing the main quest and spending even more time wandering around and doing side quests, I can say with confidence that this is one of the best games I have ever played.Skyrim truly embraces the core concepts of an open world game: the choices you make influence the story you experience, you can go wherever you want to do whatever you want, and you can mold your character into the kind of a person you want them to be. The range of options given to the player is quite impressive and allows each playthrough to be a completely different experience.The world is absolutely stuffed full of things to do. There are so many dungeons to explore, ruins to find, people to talk to, side quests to complete...the list goes on. It would take several hundred hours to see everything Skyrim has to offer. The environments are pretty and the music fits everything very well. I particularly like ""From Past to Present"", the main overworld theme.However, the game is not perfect. Combat is rather awkward and it often feels like you're swinging your sword at thin air rather than striking enemies. The main quest seemed less important to me than it should have been, and while I get that the game is extremely open-ended, I think it would have benefited from a bit more focus on the importance of defeating Alduin. There are also a great deal of bugs that have been left unpatched, so don't be surprised if you encounter glitches every once in a while.So, should you buy Skyrim now if you still haven't played it? Absolutely. It's great fun to explore the world, fight monsters, and help the citizens of the realm. I wouldn't recommend it over a game like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which improved and expanded on many of the open-world concepts found here, but it's still an amazing adventure and well worth your time."

Are you getting graphics issues and game issues because you expect your mid-tier relic to run this game on Ultra, so you left a bad review and an angry forum post denouncing Bethesda as the devil? Well if you are, you know who you are. Here's what I suggest doing to fix the problem. Unplug your computer. Toss it into a hole. Fill the hole with cement. Never go online again, unless you happen to stumble upon a clue and thus get one."

Being a fan of the elder scrolls series ever since Oblivion I think that Bethesda requires a lot of money to create incredable content. Not only do they make amazing stories but the main focus is the detail. It took the Fallout fans a 7 year gap. Not including Vegas. Now its time for us Elder Scrolls fans to wait. Give it time guys. There are more E3's to come.

Blocking is ineffective and useless, the damage taken is hardly changed when doing so. Sneak is easier than ever. Being unable to assign skill points upon level up such as in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, makes roleplaying minimalistic.After playing my first little bit, I went off to mod it a little, but when I returned to the game, the screen went blank and crashed with the Dovahkin theme playing.The Creation Club is a very greedy idea, Bethesda does not deserve any of the money that modders are getting.

Brand new 64bit engine probably will push modding to it's limits.- Beautiful godrays- TAA- Crazy drawing distances- Max 2-3 sec. loading times for cities, immediate loading times for indoors.- It looks like bethesda will continue updating this version(A beta update just came yesterday)Cons:- Still same annoying bugs, you still need to install Unofficial Patch.- No new features ( I wasn't expecting new features, but this is a con for most of oldrim players)- Serious problems with VSync. You need to disable engine's own VSync, and enable on your NVIDIA/AMD control panel to get stable 60 FPS.- Physics still bounded to FPS, really?- Still console UI for PC version, really Bethesda, really?- More to say for UI, you can't use SkyUI on that version yet. SKSE is still in the works for SSE, and it will take too much time.- About SKSE, most of scripted mods are not available yet for SSE.Should you buy it if you already have oldrim?- Yeap, definitely worth it. Oldrim's unlimited map loading times are enough reason for that."

I guess all in all I didn't really lose anything as that's how much they would have cost me, but I could have probably got them for much less on sale.Even maxed out with new graphics, the game still looks dated. The combat is still dreadfully boring, the voice acting is pretty terrible and there isn't a lot of variety. The game is riddled with bugs, you can't easily alt+tab out, and the inventory management system is still one of the worst I've seen. And because the SkyUI team is no longer supporting Skyrim there is probably not going to be a fix for that. The inventory system is almost as bad as the original Mass Effect. Playing this game reminded me how much of a disappointment Bethesda has been for their past two releases.As a redditor once said, Bethesda is known for making games as vast as an ocean, and as deep as a puddle. That still holds true here. After playing games like the Witcher 3 and Fallout New Vegas, Bethesda is really going to have to step up their game. Wait for a steam sale if you absolutely have to revisit the land of Skyrim.EDIT: I forgot how many game breaking bugs were in this game. Upon equipping ""Chillrend"" a unique sword, the sound file for its effect continues to loop, over and over. Regardless of whether you reload a save or exit the game, it's still there. And the worse part is, it stacks on top of itself, so it gets louder over time, and more annoying. The only fix is to download a mod that corrects the issue... but this disables achievements.Seriously Bethesda, go eff your self.

I'm not sure if this happens to everybody or it's just some mods I have downloaded even though I only have five mods. If anyone can help me with this issue that would be great.I've played for 40 hours and have had a ton of fun. I recommend this game to anybody that is thinking about getting it. Many complain that the game runs horribly, but most of them just don't have a good enough computer. Also people say that the game doesn't look like a 2016 Remastered edition, but the problem is would be that if Bethesda changed the graphics to much it would not feel like skyrim and more like the next game just on the same map. If you have played through the original game and all the DLC then still consider getting this game. It will allow you to relive the experience with a better looking game."

But no amount of shaders and mods can fix terrible writing, absence of character and unimaginative mass of near identical caves and dungeons. Skyrim, as they say surprisingly precise, is ""a mile wide, an inch deep hiking simulator"" that preys exclusively on people's OCD with its numerous wooden plates, forks and bone flour contained in a thousand of chests and barrels laying around. There is nothing interesting to see here if you're looking for a comprehensive RPG experience (basic stuff - coherent story, memorable characters and of course consequences to the choices you make of how to interact with all this), just a shallow husk of an okay-ish landscape design, crush test dummies for NPCs and glowing plastic swords, only a surface. I seriously spent more time searching for mods than playing the actual game, it's so completely unengaging and boring. The setting itself with its books, geographical landmarks and Words With Capital Letters means nothing without a proper context of a story. You would say there is a story - there is that civil war, there are numerous quests, jarls, guilds with their problems and whatnot. And I'd say my attempts at writing fantasy when I was 11 years old were at least hilariously bad, not just plain mediocre which is so much worse and depressing. If there are gems of writing in all these piles of content - well, I'm not patient enough to sift through ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in search of candy, if anything it makes it that much more of a wasted opportunity.You tell me what Bethesda does wrong time after time with their attempts to make an RPG. Just play New Vegas (for the lack of a better RPG made in the last decade, and engine/gameplay similarity) and try to spot what is so different between those game design philosophies.Once again - mods can't fix it as confetti can't fix a pile of steaming dung."

Unfortunately, this cash-grab they're calling a game has had a tremendously bad impact on the community. Most of the best mods can't be ported over until SKSE64 comes out, and this doesn't come with the skyrim standard packaged in. I can either play a crappy version of the game, wait for a year till the modding community catches up, or I can waste money on the standard version.

76561198128974568,Recommended,489830,31866635,Posted: 20 May,all,Horrible Orbit,"Let's clear this up early - Skyrim sucks, and this will be a very long review. I'm going to be recommending it, but objectively it's one of the worst Bethesda games. The melee is boring, the spellcasting is completely broken, and the plot and setting are as generic as they get. If you loved Morrowind for its disturbing creatures, prevailing sense of dread, and unmitigated freedom (to do what the gameplay mechanics could facilitate), you'll find Skyrim almost as much of a slap in the face as Oblivion was. Almost all of the flaura and fauna are from Earth, to start with. That's not just boring, but also a massive plot hole that's been around since Oblivion. And the RPG mechanics are so dumbed-down that they barely function in the first place. Spellmaking, for example, is completely gone. It was implimented in the worst way possible in Oblivion, sure, but it was at least tokenly there.The main character is called ""Dragonborn"" for most of the game, and this is because it's his/her destiny to fight multiple dragons, and to magically shout in their language. It's more tedious than that, but what details remain are all meaningless filler. A dragon shows up at such-and-such a location, you show up there too, you have a fight and one of you wins. Blah blah blah destiny. Rinse repeat. The various guilds and factions don't fare any better, either. The Companions want to fight, so they send you to fight stuff. The Dark Brotherhood likes murdering people, so they send you to murder people. The Theives' Guild likes stealing things, so they order you to steal things. And so on. In all cases, the developers have mistaken ""look at the shiny thing"" for good storytelling, so you'll be tasked with the exploration of picturesque dungeons for your chosen faction, full of triggered events and dialogue prompts. The problem is that most of these dungeons only exist to store the aforementioned shiny thing, and good writing would've made your (virtual) presence in them completely unnecessary. And unlike scripted conversations with an NPC, or a cutscene, you can't skip the badly written arguments your faction will have with eachother about the implications of their favorite shiny thing, often while standing in front of it. Oddly, this awful approach to storytelling actually improves the Dark Brotherhood. In Oblivion, they were essentially putting on murder mystery dinner theatre, and half the quest rewards depended on the player sticking to their part of the script. In Skyrim, at least they remember that theatrics aren't more important to their assassins' guild than murder is. Plus, their chosen 'shiny thing' isn't something you personally have to bring back to the Brotherhood hideout, and it eventually gives you more targets to hunt.The combat in Skryim is quite fun in theory, and sometimes fun in practice. If you're a meleer, you'll have no trouble equipping yourself with the proper armor and weapon needed to charge headlong into battle and clobber enemies. The trouble is that you've got only a few attacks, many of which are identical to your attacks with other weapons of the same type (2-handed axes and 2-handed hammers, for example, share most of the same animations). By hour 30 you'll have experienced literally everything your meleer can do in battle, dozens of times. If you're using a mage, the first thing you'll probably notice is that you don't start with nearly enough mana to rely on your starting spells. And to make an existing problem artificially worse, Bethesda have bafflingly decided that mana regeneration should automatically be cut in half during battles. In practice, this means that you'll need the patience of a stone to tolerate low-level spellcasting in Skyrim. Lategame spellcasting, meanwhile, is a different type of drudgery. The most powerful spells take far too long to cast in battle, and spells don't scale with your character's perks the way the weapons of a meleer or thief do. Also, the timers for summons, self-buffs, and the like are proposterously short. That's especially true of low-level mages, who have to throw away most of a mana bar in exchange for almost as much protection as an iron chestplate for a few tens of seconds. Stealth is strangely well implimented, and while it's not going to compete with the likes of Metal Gear, Splinter Cell, Shadow Of Mordor, etc., it's still fun throughout the game. Other than pickpocketing, which has an artificial success rate cap that gaurantees at least some failure as a high-level pickpocket, for no clear benefit to anyone.As you might have already heard, the soundtrack is excellent. It boasts a high level of polish throughout, and importantly, it doesn't hinder immersion when the game repeats the same track for the hundredth time. The voice acting is better than the writing, but still subpar. The sound effects, for the most part, are well chosen and well implimented.The new 64-bit engine, though, is what makes this game stand out. Not just because it facilitates improved graphics (which it does), but because it's made Skyrim much, much easier to mod extensively. Mods are what make this mediocre game amazing, and the reason why I've spent over 100 hours on this version of it after already having played vanilla to death (on the Xbox 360 port). Don't like the nonsense mana regeneration limit in battle? Mod it out. Don't like the artificial limit to pickpocket success? You can mod that out too. Want a skill tree that actually has interesting skills in it, which are viable in the early and late game both? There are several mods for that. Tired of fighting ""epic"" battles that have only 20 total combatants? You can fix that with a mod called Warzones. The only important thing you can't mod back in (yet) is spellmaking. There's a gorgeous, satisfying, deep, immersive, truly open game, with a myriad of weapons, spells, armor types, enemies, and perks - all you've got to do is build it onto 64-bit Skyrim with mods. The system requirements for that are quite steep, but if your computer is purpose-built for gaming, you're in for something truly remarkable with remastered, modded Skyrim. If you can look past Bethesda's baffling, monsterous attempt to monetize mods in the recent past, and can still stomach the idea of giving them your money, I highly recommend buying a copy of Skyrim Special Edition (even at full price) and modding it to smithereens."

,Recommended,489830,31950283,Posted: 25 May,all,//_^),"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition ReviewThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition is a graphical overhaul / remaster released on October 28 2016 of the original Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim that released worldwide on November 11, 2011. This edition comes equipped with all the DLC the original game had available for purchase and is essentially The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition with better graphics. This version of the game is perfect for users who can run the orginal Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim at maximum settings at 60 FPS but can't handle some higher end graphical overhal mods.The Creation Club is not Bethesda forcing you to pay for mods, and is not ""paid mods"", as detailed via the Creation Club Q&A section. You also have a wide range of options to choose from for other mods, so you can easily avoid the Creation Club.Strengths• Free to owners of the Legendary Edition or anybody that owns the three DLC packs (used to be: offer expired).• Creation Engine reworking means that the Special Edition is 64-bit and has support for DirectX 11, therefore allowing modders to increase what they can do with the graphics and allowing higher amounts of RAM to be used to reduce crashes and improve stability.• Perfect choice for graphics between handling Skyrim at maximum settings and a graphical overhaul.• Same great game as before!• In-built mod support.Weaknesses• Performance is worse, however it's not difficult to run. This is more likely due to my computer system.• Not worth the £30 / $40 / €40 price tag if you already own the original Skyrim.• Mod support is very limited (Skyrim Script Extender / SSKE isn't available for Special Edition yet).• Bethesda didn't take advantage of the newer engine compatibility by increasing texture resolution (or at least noticeably) or introducing larger scale battles.• Creation Engine still isn't designed for above 60 FPS, therefore higher framerates induce issues with the physics engine without proper tweaking.• You can't adjust many graphical options (you cannot increase / decrease texture resolution and the .ini configuration files are also VERY limited for example).System RequirementsMinimum:Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit Version)Intel i5-750/AMD Phenom II X4-9458 GB RAM12 GB free HDD spaceNVIDIA GeForce GTX 470 1 GB / AMD HD 7870 2 GBRecommended:Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit Version)Intel i5-2400/AMD FX-83208 GB RAM12 GB free HDD spaceNVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 3 GB / AMD R9 290 4 GBYou'll want to make sure your system does compare to these requirements, as the game definitely does require more now. I suggest doing so before you make the mistake of purchashing this game version thinking you can run it with your mobile phone like you likely could with OG Skyrim.OverallSkyrim is possibly one of my most favourite games of all time however The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition simply isn't worth the price tag if you already own the original game and DLC. The original game can also be modded to look far better than this version and some of the best mods are only available for the original game. If you got this edition for free, give it a try as it's still the same beautiful game as before. If not, wait for a sale so you get more for your money.Mod support should be less limited as time passes so maybe that's a reason for you to wait! I recommend this game nevertheless despite the flaws because it's the same game as before: one that I love!Update:The original The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has been 'hidden' from the Steam Store, although it is still accessible if you wish to purchase that version instead. Here's the link to this version below:http://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/All DLC is available for purchase, however everything together has a higher base price than The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edtion."

I have to say I already knew what I was buying, and personally the fact on how mods work doesn't bother me too much as I prefer the vanilla game a lot to begin with. The game looks better with the updated textures and such, however it still has issues with framerate even on the best computers in 2017. Even with messing with the settings, it still has these moments it only has about 15 frames. But even then, knowing how fun and enjoyable Skyrim is make it bearable in my opinion as to others this could kill it for them. I want to say if you love exploring and just getting lost, always hoping to find something new all the time, this is the game for you. Not to mention this edition comes with all the DLC's such as Dawnguard. It has many ways to make your character unique and feel like this is your story in a lot of the time. However I do have to say that some missions feels tedious and repetitive and just feel boring. An example would be to enter the bard's college you need tofind a verse in some catacombs surrounded by the undead.Simple things like this felt unessecary. So there will be some quests here and there that may be boring and uneeded, but I assure you that Skyrim has much more in it to give you complete immersion. I highly recommend to buy this editiong ONLY if you prefer vanilla Skyrim with how it is with how Bethesda made it with it's DLC.This game still hasn't fixed many bugs however, and the ai still have those moments to keep in mind when buying this version. So in reality you are just buying a better looking game."

You can choose from a variety of races that each have their own individual perks and then, decided between three major classes: stealthy gameplay, warrior-like gameplay, or one that is fueled by magicka and involves casting spells. You're met with a least two major questlines that involve eliminating the anthetical character, Alduin, and choosing between the two sides in the war, the Stormcloaks and the Empire. Personally, I normally side with the Empire because the Stormcloaks are a racist group of uneducated Nords that don't really contribute anything to the diverse nation of Skyrim. I must issue a warning to anyone that has assignments to complete or a social life to tend to because Skyrim will utilize a lot of that time.

May contain spoilers.Skyrim... Where do I begin?When it was released back in November 11,2011 it was the most graphically atmospheric game we ever played back in the day. Everyone claimed it was the best RPG game ever made, which of course is debateable. Till today, the game is ever so beautiful in many different aspects.The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim is a game for you if you LIKE...>Exploring a vast world>Riding a horse while shooting arrows unto innocent bunnies (Why would you anyway?)>DRAGONS (Duh)>Joining a Faction/Guild (Or kill them. Up to you man.)>Pickpocketing someone's clothes right out of them (See Pickpocketing for more details)>Crafting Equipment and look bad♥♥♥♥♥(Search Daedric Armour for more info.)>Stunning horizons>Going through a cave or dungeon>Making potions>Eating a giant's toe for its properties (Because why not?)>Adopt up to 2 children in your own home>Flying up to the clouds when interacting with a giant (Try it)>Werewolves and Vampires. Yeah.>ETC...The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim is NOT for you if you DISLIKE...>Exploring dungeons or caves>Medieval times>Giant spiders (Arachnophobia bewarned.)>Dragons (Wait, you dislike dragons? Are you even human?)>Long questlines or sidequests>Honestly I didn't think I'd make it this far in the DISLIKE section so...Generally, The Elder Scrolls series is an amazing series. It brings out the adventurer in you and your need to explore a world without leaving your seat. (Do consider leaving your seat though, the real world out there is beautiful too.) Once you are bored with the contents, go ahead and mod the crap out the game. You won't be disappointed.My rating for The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim 9/10"

I've played the original and their are some pretty significant differences IMO. The dev team pretty much too the engine they used for Fallout 4 and applied it to Skyrim and updated the textures, which is a good thing to me. As for why people are giving it so much hate I don't understand because back on 360 and ps3 I wasted well over 150+ hours playing it on each system. I love that they paid attention to all the smaller details and they game just feels more alive than the orginal. If anybody takes anything away from my review is to take this, try it for yourself before you say it's not worth the money. I played this game to death when I was younger and now I'm taking full advantage of it on PC and I'm loving every second of it. If you don't like it, get a refund. If you do like it show the devs some love so they will release more games like this."

It flew under my radar as I was obsessed with Lego Star Wars and trading toy figures among my classmates. I've gotten older and my tastes have matured a bit. I'm getting ready to attend university and it's become harder and harder to have personal contact with my closest friends. For me, gaming was a medium to interact with the people I loved, to have adventures together. Unfortunately, we're all getting ready to venture down different paths in our real lives. What was a passion of mine started to dwindle as opportunities for spending time together evaporated.This release couldn't have come at a better time for me. My interest was piqued with the overwhelming positivity surrounding this game, and I was excited to enter the world of Skyrim. I feel like this can give me something to connect with for awhile, even if it's all fake. My friends and I are unable to hang out now, but this just might get me through until we can again."

It's the same old Skyrim, just with all the DLC bundled and a 64-bit engine to increase stability and enable the creation of even crazier, more powerful mods. Some textures look a bit blurry up close, but thats nothing a few mods can't fix!The modding community, though in its infancy, is still quite spectacular. It's amazing what people can do without the access that SKSE grants. I'm running something like 80+ mods for mymostly vanillaplaythrough. If you want to go and mod the crap out of your game, I refer you to MxR Mods, an amazing YouTube channel that does a weekly series for Skyrim and Fallout 4 modding. If you're a modder, you've probably already heard of him.I have something like 100+ offline hours with this, as well as the thousands of hours on my various play throughs I did on my PS3 and Istillhaven't completed all of the base content, even things like the Dark Brotherhood quest line. This is an amazingly fun time-sink that I think everyone should try their hand at. The gameplay is fun, but the story is pretty garbage until people actually realize that you are the Dragonborn. The Civil War is quite interesting and enjoyable to participate in as well, and there are a few (buggy) mods to enhance or overhaul it. Mine is kinda sorta maybe broken beyond repair, but it's funny as all hell when your mods come together to cause chaos. A favorite memory of mine is a mexican wrestler dragon breathing fire onto explosive chickens. Game died, as did I (from laughter). A must play."

The 60 frame caps is slightly annoying but there are guides to work around it, but my issue is the lack of SkyUI, the native UI is horrible for me personally, and I can't function without SkyUI, although I realize its just an issue of waiting on SKSE support.

,Recommended,489830,26491794,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,JSA7X,"Ok, so i really dont want to write this, but i feel like ive been let down, and should explain whyDISCLAIMER: I love skyrim and everything it has to offer, and this is in no way badmouthing Skyrim or Bethesda, im jsut annoyed by my experience.So, first things first, the game itself. Its skyrim, nothing more, nothing less. Its still the awesome world where you can find flying mammoths, but its just prettier. This was specifically made for console users honestly. Ive been playing the original game for the past few days with some beautification mods, as well as a texture and graphics update that Betehesda even put out for PC players. if you want better graphics, go to the workshop and download the mods. Itll look almost exactly the same.And the next thing i wanted to put out was the game running in general. my hardware and graphics are much better than the requirements and the recommended settings. Despite this, the game just wouldnt open for about 10 minutes. It would crash and crash and crash, but finally. it finally loaded up.... and the framerate was abysmal. there was a 2 second delay for my cursor, making starting a new game difficult (Oh, and BTW, you dont get to keep your saves from the previous version, which i was told that you could), and once the game loaded up, it was like i was having a seizure. On top of that, the graphics, the lighting, the textures, all the same. Not much of a difference, xcept it game me a hemeroid to even load up the game.Again, this is just my experience, and how i was dissapointed with it. Im sure this is just a rare case, but id thought id share it in an effot to see if it can come up again and maybe be fixed.In conclusion, if you already own skyrim and the DLC, not worth it at all. If you dont own the DLC, just buy the DLC, youre not getting much for buying a seperate game where you cant keep your save. And if you dont own Skyrim, buy this. For the people jsut getting into skyrim, this is the best price for you. You get the main game, as well as the 3 dlc which adds up to around $45, for just 40.Do i recommend this game? For PC players who've played it before ON PC, no, no i dont. But for those just getting the game and want everything it has to offer, then yes. Get it."

The point of this purchase is slightly diminished when you consider that there are mods for the Original Skyrim that make it look just as good, if not better. But to be honest, I don't particularly care or mind that. If you haven't played any Elder Scrolls games before, and modding is not really your thing, this is an excellent purchase. It's the same solid Skyrim gameplay, rpg mechanics, and magical/melee combat, with greater visual fidelity. Oh, and bonus, YOU GET THE DLCS FREE. Highly recommend if you are new to the franchise. Otherwise, stick with the original if you don't feel like throwing out 40 bucks."

No more striping and blocky, crappy shadows no matter what you do!The lighting, is a definite upgrade as well. You'll notice it most in forested areas at dawn and dusk. It's really impressive!Another thing that got a major upgrade was the default view distance. No more modding and tweaking settings in order to get a proper view of the world of skyrim from afar - it's all right there when you start.One negative comment I have is that z-fighting (texture flickering at distance) is still very much a thing in skyrim se, unfortunately."

DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ALREADY OWN SKYRIM.There, now onto other things.I see all these complaints that it is too expensive, but it does come with all the DLC's. Including the one that pretty much adds a whole new continent to the game. So that is a LOT of gameplay, because it is both vanilla and dlcs to boot. This might be a bit unfair to people who have never playd Skyrim though, admittedly. Because they don't know if they will like the game.The graphics are better, somewhat. Not a lot, but just enough to be noticeable. I think that mostly it just helps it run smoother. The orignal skyrim (which belonged to my brother) would sometimes run in a very jumpy way. I bought this version and ran it on the same computer, since my brother has moved out and taken the game with him. It runs way smoother! The controls are the same, but the fact that my screen wont suddenly jump one way and pass the enemy really helps."

Nah.Okay, TO BE FAIR, the stuff on the Creation Club is actually very good quality, as good or better than the best free mods. My one and only issue with the Creation Club is that CC content can only be purchased with Bethesda's premium currency; aka micro-transactions. If CC content could be purchased like ordinary DLC, I would have zero problems with it.I suppose I should also review the actual game of Skyrim. Honestly, this game needs no introduction. Skyrim is easily the best fantasy sandbox available right now. The controls are great, the gameplay is engaging, and the whole thing was built to be easily moddable for your gaming pleasure.If I could name only one criticism about the gameplay, it's the lack of the class system present in previous Elder Scrolls games. All characters have more-or-less the same generic starting stats, and perks do a poor job of helping you specialize since you have to max out all of your stats in order to earn the default limit of 80 perk points (there are 251 perks spread across all skill trees). The introduction of ""legendary"" skills via a patch has alleviated this somewhat, but it is extremely clunky in its implementation.There is an in-game mod libarary that you can browse, but this is really only useful to console players: PC players have access to the far superior Nexus website for their modding needs. That being said, the in-game library does have some mods that have yet to appear on the Nexus that are quite useful, so be sure to browse it once in awhile.Overall, it's a good game. Just avoid the Creation Club, because it's garbage."

76561198273899758,Recommended,489830,34620819,Posted: 30 August,all,bearcanyons,"Just finished my first (admittedly somewhat rushed) playthrough of the game and recently started a second one, so I thought I had played enough to give my initial review.Do I recommend Skyrim?  Hell yeah!Do I recommend this version at full price?  No.  If you want to get the game, either wait until this version is on sale for ~$20 or buy the original here:http://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/Although this version has the DLC and improved graphics, neither are, in my opinion, needed for an enjoyable experience.So, let's go through the pros and cons of Skyrim.Pros+ An enjoyable story that will take 15-30 hours to complete on average+ Although this is a bit debated, I enjoyed the combat well enough and found plenty of fun in customizing what weapons and magic I used+ Beautiful landscapes and a wonderful Scandinavian-inspired setting+ A♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of content beyond the main story, including ~5 guilds, 100+ clearable locations, and countless side quests+ Generally good writing+ Plenty of skills to upgrade, leading to a, in my opinion, highly replayable experience+ An extremely active and dedicated modding community+ Good performance (at least on my computer)Cons- Every character in the game is voiced by a cast of around 10 actors, and it's noticeable- Can be very buggy at points (I ran into a potentially game-breaking bug in my first playthrough, although I think I may have caused it)-Dated-looking characters (Edit #1)- Paid mods :(- Although it didn't bother me, combat can get a bit repetitiveOverall, I've really enjoyed Skyrim!  Every issue I had with it is minor and isn't a deal-breaker.  If I were to give it a numbered score, I think it deserves a9.5/10, the main problem being it's general bugginess.  Once again, I'd highly recommend the game itself any day, but perhaps not this version if it's not on sale.Edit:About 35 hours in now, still loving it.  May have not said this in the original review, but believe it or not this is my first time playing Skyrim!  So the review was much more about the game itself than the Special Edition features.  I'll get to all of this Bethesda controversy later.Since the initial review I've played around 2 hours with mods, and honestly the Creation Club is pretty slick.  The main reason why I'm currently using it over the Nexus Mod Manager is so I can have seperate saves for modded and unmodded characters (does that still apply if you use 3rd party mod managers?)  As for gameplay, pretty much all of what I said in the original review still applies.  Something that I meant to mention is that while the enviornments are breathtaking, the characters look pretty dated, and have for quite some time.  Luckily for us, there are mods that make them look better, but compared to other modern RPGs and even newer Bethesda games like Fallout 4, the character faces and animations look pretty stiff and plasticy.Now, about the Creation Club controversy.  In my opinion, paid mods (on their own) are not a BAD thing.  They're not a great idea, and have potential for abuse, but I don't think that they're some unthinkable, horrible thing that should never be used.  The way Bethesda has implemented them and responded to the backlash, however, is not good.  So far, I really haven't seen a whole lot of major mods that cost anything, but I can understand why people are upset about this.Overall, as I said before, Skyrim still remains a great game and one of the best RPGs of all time.  However, I'd really recommend getting the original version if you don't already own it.  It's cheaper,  has more mod support, and I don't think the Special Edition has enough extra features to make up for the extra $20 and controversial Creation Club."

Now, I've come to realize how bad a game this actually is.The next time you play this game, think. Think about the world design. Does it feel good to you? Is it memorable, well constructed? Designed to feel and fuction like a real world open for your exploration?Or does it feel like a bunch of areas randomly cobbled together with empty roads between them, with random events arbitrarily occuring at any moment to make it look like the game is ""alive""?When you engage in combat, what are you doing? Are you engaged in a test of reaction time, movesets, resource managment, will, and skills? Or are you flailing with a couple of moves, a pause button, and random health items, reloading saves if you fail?When you go out on a quest, think about it. Are you going out to learn something, unlock a new area, help a character in a meaningful way, or are you going from point A to point B on a directional compass that the game tells you to use, to retrive something someone needs to make or do something to advance some piece of ""story"", or going to kill someone for someone else, or what? Is it always like that? Is that really just the game?Maybe you bought it for the story. Did the story have a competent begining, middle and end? Did it ustilize the open world well, alowing for branching paths, a complex mission, and the sense of adventure? Or did the game point you from points A to B, meeting with people to have dialouge sessions that ultimatley affect nothing, because you'll kill the end boss with the right people's help in the end anyway? Did the NPCs leave a mark on you? Did you know them, feel their struggles, even feel emotioanlly attached to them? Or did you see a bunch of cardboard characters meant to dump quests on you?Look, my point is, I've grown to hate skyrim. Really, all the Bethesda RPGs. They have no substance, no depth. Sure, they're as wide as the eye can see, but what the eye sees at first is all that is there.If you still don't believe and understand me, go watch Hhbomberguy's video ""Fallout 3 is Garbage and Here's Why"".

Most every item can be picked up or used in some fashion. This game has stayed true to the elder scrolls serise and if you have played oblivion or morrowind you will sense a pleasant familiarity. Additionally, fallout 3, new vegas and 4 have similar mechanics, However, skyrim allows the training of skills based on use of the particular skill. As this game has an open world, you are likely to find yourself exploring most of it and the world itself can be very visualy beautiful. As one travels north they find themselves in a frozen tundra contrasted by the south's more lush and tropical setting. Enjoy"

If you don't have it, buy it.If you don't care about mods, buy this one. With the DLC included, it's $25 (!!) cheaper than the original.Everyone is up in arms about ""Bethesda being greedy and is making mods pay to play."" There is some merit to this, but it isn't completely true. Bethesda is creating a ""club"" where people can join to create content for games along with bethesda to ensure its quality. The creators will get paid and this content will cost money, but they aren't shutting down free modding - something most people don't seem to understand.However, modding support hasn't been added for Skyrim: Special Edition yet...And the original skyrim has been hidden from steam store searches, which is bullsh*t. Also, the origianl has trading cards on steam, special edition does not (wtf).I'm recommending anyways because with whatever's going on with modding it's still an amazing game and a great deal.In case you want it, here's a link to the original game's store page:http://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/"

It has crafting that will allow you to craft everything in the game (this quickly becomes annoying and quite boring unless you cheat the game and it is still boring )  it also allows you to lvl all weapon skills which also becomes very annoying and repetitive IE boring ( and yes boring even if you cheat the game ).

And I recently updated the drivers on my Nvidia GTX 1060 and now the game won't render any characters, buildings or the terrain surrounding the character.  I am going to ask for a refund.  This was a terrible experience.  I won't be purchasing any Bethesda Studio games any time soon as I am tired of paying money to beta test a game.*edit* I ""played"" the game for a total of just under 7 hours according to steam.

So much to do and so many different ways to it. With different beasts to fight and factions to deal with you will really feel like a true epic fantasy hero. The environments are great, the encounters are breathtaking and the character creation is one of the best. However, it can be a bit buggy like in the Dragonborn expansion where I ended up being unable to move until having to look up different stock commands. Also I'm always nervous whenever I have to ride my horse since whenever I jump it becomes quite floaty and I fear taking a serious fall from what attempted to be just a little jump (the sight of a flying horse is a little funny though). But the pros in this case outweigh the cons, highly recommended. Now if you'll excuse me, I got a dragon to slay."

76561198031041139,Recommended,489830,35205490,Posted: 25 September,all,Cyrus.Vance,"I have played vanilla Skyrim when it first came out, but it had so much content, that I, as many others, stopped playing it before finishing every quest. Also expansions Dawnguard and Dragonborn added even more places to discover and junk to collect obsessively :)  Not to mention all the mods that the community created. So I thought I will give it another trywith all the expansions and mods to answer the question: is Skyrim still a great game in 2017? The short answer is: absolutely yes.The Special Edition added some improvements and contains all official DLC so it is a good starting point.These were some grumblings when it came out, because it was not compatible with the mods made for the original,but thanks to the great community most mods were ported to SE.If you want to try a better and personalized version of Skyrim, your starting point should definitely be the Nexus mod community, and their amazing tool, the Nexus Mod Manager. It is essential, because it helps you download, install, and organize mods. I have stayed away from the content mods (like new quests, dungeons etc) because I don't have the next 2-3 years for Skyrim alone :)  So I stuck with mods that improve visuals, ui and general playability, so I ended up with a list of about 25 mods that were loaded at once. The Nexus Mod Manager had no problem maintaining that and there were no conflicts.Here is a list of the more important ones:- Total character makeover: this mod improves the notoriously ugly faces in Bethesda games :)- Unofficial Skyrim Patch: essential. It fixes a LOT of small bugs, that were missed by the devs.- better fabrics and clothes: nicer looking fabrics, flags, rugs etc.- Immersive Citizens AI: NPCs behave in a more natural manner, less robot-like.- weather effects: nice looking fog, snow, cloud, rain etc.- water quality: better looking rivers, lakes, streams.- realistic blood: improved blood splatter and textures.- Better shaped weapons: replaces the usually paddle-like swords and oversized hammers and axes with more realistic-looking, functional models.- Skyrim Flora Overhaul: better looking and more detailed trees, flowers bushes etc.- Hi Def texture pack: self-explanatory- Static mesh improvement: replaces the 3D models of almost every object in the game with a higher polygon-count, better looking model.- Follower tweeks: allows more control over followers, manage their tactics, gear. Also allows you to have more than one follower.- SkyUI: improves the painful, consol-port UI of Skyrim to be much more usable on PC. Especially the inventory system. A must-have.- Quality World Map: replaces the map with a higher quality 3D map- Font Replacer: replaces the plain default font of the UI with something more fantasy-like, fits better to the setting.- Heavy Armory: additional weapons to add more variety. Glaives, spears, shortswords etc.- Royal Armory: adds unique weapons to High ranking NPCs, like Jarls, Generals etc, so they don't run around with the same shoddy weapons as the common bandits.- Scoped bows: better archery experience.With these mods the game's looks make it competitive to current titles and the usability is way better that the original.Also you can browse literally hundreds of mods to tailor the experience to your taste.The game is not without its faults, for example the followers AI is still not the best, they tend to get stuck in doorways or disappear for a while to take a totally different route. The map is still confusing in multi-leveled locations, because the levels overlap each other. Also some of the locations in the Dawnguard quest-line feel like just padding, large and empty for no reason, to make the play-time longer.So, if you played it before, and want to get back to Skyrim, or you are a new player, I can only recommend it, as it is still one of the best RPGs out there. But it addictive and it will take hundreds of hours of your life, so don't say, I didn't warn you :)"

Volumetric fog also made it look more natural (distant objects are foggy instead of looking sharp), and the implementation of proper ambient occlusion made it look more realistic (as opposed to forced driver AO). Gone are the shaky and jagged shadows that were also seen (even with mods) from the original Skyrim.A.I. system for detecting hidden players also revamped as well, and made it feel more natural and realistic (original Skyrim AI sees through walls, SE acts accordingly based on sight and sound)If you have a modern graphics card and want to experience Skyrim in max settings + hi mesh mods without slowdowns, this is it.https://youtu.be/SNDdrTUKzxsAchievements can be acquired if modded through a simple DLL fix available in nexus mod.Skyrim SE Just performs way better:https://youtu.be/JRzLgRvqfDshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xv4AI2Vn5E"

,Recommended,489830,31926301,Posted: 23 May,all,Zetawilk,"I only had the chance to play the original Skyrim thanks to a generous friend, so when SE came out and I had the coin, I figured I'd finally spring for it now that all the tiresome memetics had died down. Memes aside, this game actually does stand on its own, but boy is it tiresome.So yeah, this game pretty much has it all in terms of gameplay mileage. Progressive quests, character customization. It's dulled down a little because characters can do it all, but some people don't want to juggle half a dozen saves, so it's just less of a headache in the long run. With very few story branches, you'll only need at most two characters to try it all, which is fine because after the Argonians and Khajiit, there're just two more races: Humans and elves.Still, it's all worth it not to have Skyrim crashing every time you want to load your saved game or move between areas. The mods are sorely lacking, but at least the core few you'll want are available, save for a streamlined menu you can organize. SE's been out a long time now, but perhaps people will eventually learn not to rely on SKSE dependencies just for the bare essentials. Word of warning: Functionally this game has no achievements on Steam, because those are disabled if you use mods, and you are going to want to get the Unofficial Skyrim Patch which does all the work Bethesda didn't see fit to do. I don't get why either of those things are, either. This game is exceedingly buggy without it.Just like in Quest for Glory, you can play a fighter, mage or thief. Just like in Quest for Glory, you can wander around the woods fighting monsters, witches and so forth. Just like in Quest for Glory, there are multiple quests to go on and rings of mushrooms and dryads. In fact, one of the few things missing from Quest for Glory is Rakeesh lecturing you on becoming a paladin, though people will still let you do all the legwork for them (which is what makes this a video game).The game gets very fatiguing, though. It tries very hard to be fun, but it doesn't maintain an interest factor. The lore's cool, it's just that waltzing through Dwemer ruins really takes it out of you. People with a dual-monitor setup are gonna wanna put on Netflix while traipsing about. While the main questline divides itself into important world-saving crisis and petty civil war between a dozy idealist widow and an incompetent bigot, it all starts to look quite a bit samey after a while. This actually detracts from the involvement with the story, because you have to keep track of all the different ""races"" of humans and elves, but frankly I barely take notice when you're even speaking to a pointy-eared human versus a human human. I notice you couldn't marry any Khajiit. It's a little bit of a letdown, but marriage doesn't really add that much to the gameplay, so it's just as well. Having to circumnavigate the very numerous impassible mountains and cliffs gets frustratingly tedious very quickly.While still quite pricey despite this game just being a remake--more of a compression, really, and all to repair the anachronistic 32-bit executable of the initial release--you definitely get a lot of play hours out of it all, and very little of it is contrived through cut-off points via branching plot points. The graphics aren't really noticeably different between the two releases. As for improvements over previous Skyrim games, each skill is streamlined for only the important ones. The menus are a hassle to navigate due to a console focus, but not too noisy. The control scheme can easily be gotten used to. Difficulties are nothing much beyond health and damage multipliers."

It has the occasional bug but I can live with it for the freedom to do whatever I want and fight the way I see fit.  I have only had this new version for a couple of days and have put about 12 hours on it.

With new enemies, ingredients for your alchemy-skill and new spells.To sum it up,I knew most of the bugged quests from the original game and was able to avoid them.Special Edition? The package is good. If you have Skyrim and want only better graphics,get the high resolution pack for free!Dawnguard DLC   8/10Dragonborn DLC   9.5/10Hearthfire DLC    4/10     (nice but not needed for general gameplay)Gameplay +100 hours, replayability   9/10"

Fantastic. The dragon took flight and sent the farmers cart spiraling through the air as the other swooped by and layed a carpet of flames.

Combat isn't really anything special, it's far better than the previous Elder Scrolls games but compared to modern day melee combat, it isn't anything to go raving about, that said I do enjoy the combat. Story is pretty good There's 5 quest lines: The Companions, Theives Guild, Dark Brotherhood, College of Winterhold, and the mainstory. Aswell as the Dawnguard and Dragon Born DLCs, not to mention the over hundred side quests or so. The game has so much to do that you can definetly get multiple playthroughs done and still not have seen everything. Mods are also a fun addition to the game. Most of the mods I use are graphics related ones, but there are many out there to spice up your game. Overall this game is a must have.BTW don't buy the creation club crap (Dwarven Mudcrabs, hell yeah I'll pay for that! That's quality content right there.)Hopefully they learned from Fallout 4 not to force everyone to download their paid mods before buying it.In conclusion buy the game, don't buy creation club content for it."

,Not Recommended,489830,30007422,Posted: 18 February,all,my_granny,"This game is the biggest scam in gaming ever. While it pretends to be this super-duper, epic adventure, this is just a medium-quality mod for Fallout 3. But while in Fallout the emptiness of the open world may easily be explained as the results of nuclear holocaust, here, in the pseudo-medieval realm, it makes no sense at all. It feels unnatural and disturbs the illusion.So this was my first and biggest gripe. Second is the monotony of quest and missions: ""Go somewhere and retrieve/kill something"". How can it even be compared to the ones in Witcher 3, where every side-mission was a well-written short story, with interesting characters and intriguing plot?Lastly, there is the question of bad directing and acting. One of the early mission sends the main character (a so-called Dragonborn) to meet with the cult that worships the Dragonborns. And except like two lines of mild excitement, they don't seem to give a ♥♥♥♥ about him, and just proceed to give him another task. And that kind of things ruined the experience for me.On the bright side, I really like the level-up system. It is based on this pretty rational notion, that if you practise something or gain knowledge about it, you get good at it. Who would've thought, right?All in all, I did spend almost 20 hours with Skyrim, and while there was this feeling ""OK, OK, now it will get awesome"", it has failed to materialize yet. And I do have some games, so no more wasting time on this disappointment."

The addition of DLC alone (yes, it comes with all of the DLC) with a few integral remastered SE (Special Edition) mods make the experience much better than the original.If you've never played Skyrim before, and you're deciding between this and the original version:I recommend this one! It's a great remaster minus a few issues with sound compression. Most of that can be fixed with mods (you may argue that you shouldn't have to, and I do agree with you, but the overall experience makes it much better).As of 20 hours, I have not crashed my client in any way. I played 10 hours of vanilla content before adding some game additions. I would check your minimum settings before purchasing this game, and check against the recommended settings too, since the engine has been upgraded to 64-bit and some people may not be able to run it anymore, especially if they didn't research the upgrade. For reference, I am running a gtx 970 with a core i7-4790k. I get 60fps in most areas, though some expanse underground areas drop the fps considerably (usually not in open worlds, strangely), for example in the Ratway Vaults.If you've never played Skyrim before, you're in for a treat! I have sunk 400 hours in and out of the steam client into this game. Enjoy an open world RPG that you start on Thursday, forget work on friday, and after just one more hour it's already Monday.

Overall this is an improvment over the unmodded vanilla.Mods are being updated for SE.If you have a good PC you need to tweak things.Biggest issue i had was to high FPS. With VSync on frames would drop from 144 to 8 randomly. Turn VSync off and it ran at 144fps but caused the game phyics engine to start to glitch out. Things would fly about and rattle, i even got killed by a plate. To fix this i have to use NVidia Inspector and limit the FSP to 70FPS. Game runs fine now.Overall for a 5 year old game it is showing its age, unmodded characters look bad, engine feels clunky, combat still feels clunky, just like Fallout 4. That said it never was an action RPG. I look foward to the next elder scroll title with a modern engine, maybe where you can sprint and jump and bounding box reflects visable objects. No one likes having a good shot at a target only to find your arrows sticking into thin air.If you loved this game they yeah its worth the money if you just liked it then maybe till a sale.

I'm relatively new to Tamriel, this is my first time playing through Skyrim, and my first Elder Scrolls game. I've spent a lot of time just wandering around marveling at how damn beautiful everything is. I've put about 35 hours into playing this game so far, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the game mechanics and the huge world. Tons of exploration, great action. The native support for modding and tweaking the appearance and effects really give you the ability to create a truly immersive experience.When this edition came out, in addition to all the hype, there was a considerable amount of grumbling from people who already owned all of the content included in the SE, who nonetheless felt compelled to go out and purchase it the day it came out, so that they could complain about how their heavily modded (older) game looked better than the vanilla version. I'm not sure what their point was supposed to be. The game has a very dedicated modding community, and so any heavily modded version is going to look, feel, and sound better than the vanilla version. More to the point, this is a re-release, not a remake. If you already have a heavily modded version of Skyrim, don't buy this one. But if that's you, why are you even reading this? You know that this game is amazing, just play it. On the other hand, if you've only played previous editions on a console, having the ability to mod out your game is a huge improvement over the vanilla settings, and might be worth the price tag, as you'll essentially be opening up a whole new game with all of the additional content."

There's no other changes to it, besides the graphics and less crashing. If you already own the non-Special Skyrim, you can simply download as many graphical mods as possible to make the game look better than this. In fact, I would suggest investing in non-Special Skyrim for the time being, due to the amount of mods currently on that game, in comparison to here, which is still growing.But hey, with mods, this is already better than without. There is already a sizeable enough base for mods, so you can download what catches your eye. It also comes with all DLC, so you will not have to purchase it individually. Eventually, once there are enough mods for the Special Edition, it is best to make the switch to it. By itself, though, Skyrim Special Edition is still a complete package, and not a waste of time."

This is what I expected. It looks great and plays just like the original. The new textures and the amount it allows you to process now makes it look and feel great. But of course their are some cons to this whole game. As always with Skyrim on PC, an ENB makes it look way better. And the gameplay would be fantastic, but its not due to all the quest bugs. Too many quests in this game cannot be finished because of the NPC either walking away or forgetting about the mission you just did. They'll just sit somewhere or do whatever they usually do and not open the quest dialogue. Or broken mechanics of the game where certain puzzles wont function, some doors wont open, and some things will just dissapear. But as a PC player most of these can be avoided through console commands. SO if you think that you may buy it for someone or yourself on console. Don't."

It is incredibly addicting, and I honestly love it so much that I think about it when I am not at home and am unable to play. The characters are in-depth, and there are so many side quests and places to explore that you literally can't get bored! Plus, when choosing between Stormcloaks and Empire, it is actually a pretty hard decision where the game presents both options as ""choose between what you think is the greater evil"" for a newbie like me. It isn't biased towards one decision, YOU make the decisions around Skyrim and choose YOUR fate and journey. If you want a good, interactive, and beautiful fantasy game, then this is the one.Just be prepared for many crashes, such as mine has done (I have Windows 10 and play on my computer). Save frequently. VERY frequently. The game freezes on me all the time, and I have to shut down my computer because there is no other way to get out of the game when it freezes, but I also have several mods added to it that may not help. Still, besides the constant crashing, I do recommend the game. It gets annoying, but the crashes are almost worth it to play."

Before, it was like Morrowind III before nVidia's Geforce 256.Special Edition is 64bit, which allows for the game engine to dump around 5GB of world space into main memory (it would be a good move if Bethesda allowed 10GB of it for 16GB PC systems) with standard 2k texture mods and enb.It also allows for an astonishing 35,000 grass distance without a single problem on low-end PC systems that is not even remotely possible on the original without causing minute by minute crashes and, if you know what you're doing, you can lock this to 30fps without a single dip throughout an entire 6 hour play session.Special Edition can fully distance-draw in a way that even Dyndolod in the original Skyrim simply can't do effectively.Skyrim is also a reminder that, given the power of the x86 PC in the 64bit scope, it should be understood that once game developers start to use Crytek or Unreal's engine, in a 64bit to-the-metal, capacity, there is going to be a monumentally large shift in what we currently know as ""amazing graphics coupled to amazing game worlds"".Just 3 years from now, by 2020, consumers and gamers are going to have gaming systems a 100 to a 1000x more efficient than they are today.And the reason that is, is that memory for the past 15 years is the biggest reversal in the forward movement for what you can currently do in a 3D game engine that represents a world space."

It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Skyrim was released worldwide in November 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released—Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn—which were repackaged into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Legendary Edition, which was released in June 2013. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Special Edition, a remastered version of the game, was released for Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 in October 2016, including all three DLC expansions and a complete graphical upgrade, along with additional features. A port for Nintendo Switch is planned for release in 2017.Skyrim's main story revolves around the player character and their effort to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. Skyrim continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.The game was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse game world than Oblivion's Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Skyrim was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly mentioning the character development and setting, and is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the first week of its release, and sold over 30 million copies across all platforms.No i didn't write that my buddy google did it."

There are some things still missing such as 'parallax textures', SKSE & its many glorious babies, but what's here is a great base already.  The modding community really has been kicking out tons of goodies and seems already endless with possibilities and potentials.  You WILL need to mod this if you want better looking characters and such, but that's always been the best part about Skyrim, you can mix it into your own vision of perfection.FYI if you're really missing parallax textures (like myself), there is a partial workaround for now, use the Oldrim mod ""Real Roads""  so the bricks are meshed, this is the most noticeable missing visual without Parallax textures, flat roads are mehh :P ...but that mod mostly fixes the roads issue until we get parallax support.I definitely recommend SkyrimSE to ALL Windows8/8.5/10 gamers, also to anyone that loves modding, and to anyone who enjoys epic vast open worlds to explore/play."

I didn't care that I was ignorant of the history or details of the series, it was EASY to immerse myself and enjoy the game.

However if you've already played the game before or if you want to buy this game just because you want to use a lot of mods, it's probably not really worth it. Especially if you plan to mod the hell out of this game. I suggest buying the game of the year edition of the original version. There's way more mods there at the moment and it's a lot cheaper too. However this version is probably less like to crash since it's the 64-bit version. Overall this game runs fine. I just wish there more mods for it. Especially the CBBE mod. The body slider mod has already been made. Just need CBBE and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton more mods to go with it. Other than that this game is still just as much fun as it was during my console gaming days. And I'd recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it before, assuming the price has either gone down when you decide to buy it or the game is on sale for a price closer to the game of the year edition. At its current price of $39.99 in the U.S., it's not worth it unless you have the hardware to run it (which the recommended specs have gone up a bit) and you want to play on a version of the game that is potentially more stable than the original. Anyway, I know this isn't much of a review, but I figured there not really a point in doing a full review discussing the flaws in this game when you can just look at the reviews from 5 years ago for the game of the year edition. This game has hardly been touched at all. Most of the glitches from the original version are still there and there were some new ones as well from what I heard."

Somehow, unlike in many other adventure games, i don't get bored to slaying enemies. That may be because there is no quests which require you killing 20 same kind of enemy in certain area where you have to wait them spawn again and again... and yes, dragon shouts are cool. I also like it that instead of enemies being at certain spot on open world there may be random events like dragon appearing or thieves threatening you.One of the most important things in this game is that you don't have to be automatically good. You can steal, kill innocent people, spare the one you were supposed to kill, adopt poor children, join the rebellion... It's all up to you!Above all, if you want to do many other things in addition to fighting, this game is for you. You can craft you own weapons, help citizen's relationship problems, make potions, build your own home and many other things. Doing different kind of things also helps you level up. Your character has levels like in many other games but you can choose what kind of perks you do want. You don't have to choose certain job class to your character, which allows you try out different things like magic, archery, alchemy, blacksmithing using two swords... If you want later specialise in something you can just start using certain kind of equipment or doing certain things which raise certain skill's level.This game may sometimes contain little bugs but they usually cause just hilarious moments. Price is not bad, graphics are beautiful, plot is good and you will get your own follower to carry your spoils so i don't see any reason why you shouldn't try it out.Hope this helps even somehow if you are pondering whether you should buy this game or not!"

I never played Skyrim before this. I had played Morrowind. This game had a few bugs that had to be solved via console commands (things not appearing/falling through the map) and some combat mechanics issues like AI not understanding elevation, and destruction spells stun perk affecting too many enemy types imo. It is relativley easy even on Legendary, with some basic thought into your build idea, I personally went backstab with a bit of destruction/conjuration. The main skyrim story was bleh, along with the civil war.I enjoyed the Thieves Guild story, and the Dragonborn DLC (included) content alot. They have some of the best dungeons in this game. Good class customization and crafting. The vast expanses of space allow you to find enjoyable side quest and spelunking. It was alot better than Fallout 3 was imo. Each main quest chain is about 6-8 quests long.Overall like 200hrs of content and I called it after killing Alduin, Miarrk, and collecting the Dragon Priest masks because I got a bit lonley.

While I would've liked to have seen some new (or at least updated) content and bug fixes, the core game and DLCs are all still there.  Mods on the other hand weren't all carried over from the original version of Skyrim --- but as modders have had time since SE's release, most of the best ones have been updated to work with SE (and on multiple platforms not formerly available in the original version of Skyrim).The game world itself looks better than it originally did thanks to the new visual overhaul --- even better than many mods that did similar enhancements to the original version of Skyrim, but without a lot of the performance hits (<FPS) that many of those mods created.As I was still playing a modded original version of Skyrim when SE was released, SE was initially more of a novelty to me because I already had mods that improved the visual aspects and (a lot) for improved gameplay, which weren't originally available for SE at its release.  But now that all of the mods I need are available for SE, I have to say that I've more-or-less transitioned completely over to SE.  While I thought I'd miss my original Skyrim characters too much to want to start over again in SE, I've got to admit, that (thanks to mods) I'm just as happy with a fresh new play-through.  Not to mention that since SE is a new STEAM  install, I can always revisit my original Skyrim saves whenever I like.Thanks to the modding community, Skyrim and Skyrim SE are a perfect 5/5 experience that Bethesda can never hope to match with impersonal online MMOs.  The personal storyline and hi-res environment have way more of an importance (to me) than overcrowded, (massively) multiplayer online worlds --- no matter how much content they throw into for sale.  Hopefully, Bethesda will revisit this style of game in the near future and give us many more years to come of ""Skyrim-ish"" entertainment.Also thanks to STEAM for providing their original Skyrim customers with a free download of SE.  That was the icing on the cake."

It's Skyrim.The main complaints that people lodge against this title is the lack of community workshop support that it has in comparison to its predecessor, the stock edition.  It's a valid complaint if you value your hotrodded-to-high-hell Elder Scrolls, but if you are like me and play it for the original vanilla atmosphere, you'll love this title.Pros:-Looks better than the base game (sans mods)-Combines all DLC from the base game-Brings modding to PC, PS4 and Xbox OneCons:-Not very many mods yet-Still buggy"

I only write reviews when I feel a game truly deserves it.

,Recommended,489830,30176499,Posted: 25 February,all,Yz.Mikee,"Ratings:Gameplay:★★★★★Immersion:★★★★☆Controls:★★★☆☆Bugs:★★★☆☆Overall:★★★★☆Short Review:Pros:Very fun gameplay, lots of customisation options, thousands of missions, immersive, different routes to choose, exciting story line, better graphics.Cons:Dungeons are repetitive, fairly buggy gameplay, awkward UI, same as the original.Long Review:Skyrim is one of the most fun games I've played and I never seem to get bored of it. However, I think the Special Edition isn't worth it if you already own the game on and all DLC on PC, as it is literally the game, all DLC and a few graphic updates put into one. It improved some of the details in the graphics, but they're hardly noticeable if you haven't got a direct comparison of the two.I owned the game on PS3 and had hundreds of hours on it, played through all the story line and main missions, but Skyrim still bought me back to play through it again. The amount of customisation there is for your character is extremely broad. You can pick from 10 different races at the first character customisation part, with thousands, if not millions, of face and body customisation options. There are loads of weapons and armour available for your to use with your character, progressively getting better as your character levels up. You can choose many paths for your character to follow, with skills allowing you to make your character mage based, archer based, warrior based or stealth based as well as different clans and mission options from you to choose from. Each playthrough will seem different. However, it has its negatives.All the dungeons in the game seen fairly repetitive, with the same gameplay just with a different layout which can be fairly boring if you're clearing out multiple dungeons. There are also quite a few bugs in the game which (while not being gamebreaking) can be annoying, but there are ways to get round all of them. The UI can be awkward to get used to. I have frequently picked the wrong dialogue option or exited out a menu by clicking instead of using arrow buttons.Overall, Skyrim Special Edition like everyone other Elder Scrolls game, is a great game to play (multiple times). If you already own the game and DLC then don't bother buying the Special Edition, it just isn't worth it, but if you're new to the game or want to play through it again on PC then definitely buy it ASAP."

I've played this game for half a thousand hours...It keeps pulling me in because it really feels like a world. The variety of landscapes from picturesque grasslands to icy ridges, so many different people and creatures, groups and factions, from everyday life to raw battles to high magic and dragons, from running errands to solving puzzles to unveiling the history & presence of Skyrim. there's righting the wrong, wronging the right, just wandering around, terminating all life or saving the world...Skyrim has everything, and the right feel with many many side quests.[something that Fallout 4 lacks after somewhat over a hundred hours, the whole map is brown-gray and gets boring. post-nuclear or not, they could have introduced some some kind of variety (New Vegas at least had an untouched green area somewhere, that was nice), and there is nothing much beside the main story line]Well, that's a full thumbs-up for Skyrim."

A number of side quests have been left on the table but it is through my own choice that I left them (became a little monotonous some of the Thief’s Guild and Dark Brotherhood quests).  Overall, this was the first time I’ve played Skyrim (the Special Edition) and I must admit, I think I’ve enjoyed it even more than Fallout 4 (never thought I’d enjoy a bow that much).  Although I did find some bugs that prevented me from progressing with a quest or sometimes completing a quest, using the commands found on the Wiki pages, I was able to rectify it and carry on so it didn’t detract at all from my enjoyment of this game.  So I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anybody who likes these types of games.  Now I need to pick up the pieces of my crumbling social life but will definitely keep an eye out for what Bethesda offers up next."

I'm not the biggest expert in mods but the Steam Workshop would have been perfect for me because it was so easy to subscribe to a mod and then you could have a mod manager everytime you started up the game to tick which mods you would like on or not but now you need to log on to the Bethesda modding thing to be able to download mods and it kinda sucks having to do this everytime and you can't get achievements if you have mods on. I guess it makes sense if you are trying to cheat but even if you download mods to improve the atomspheres a bit more or add on quests, it still disables achievements.Overall, I believe that the special edition is a excellent new game and certainly improves on the original game. If you are a newbie for Skyrim then it would be best to buy this instead of the original. If you have the original and you like a modded skyrim then there's no rush to buy this game because it's almost like the original just slightly better and the mods are much better on the original at the moment."

Not much, other than these features:= Optional, higher quality graphics, included!= Better mod support! (Only within Bethsedia's own workshop, which you can use, in ANY platform, THIS game is released in!)Anyways, to explain the basic idea of this game, you are someone, of whom is destined to save the world, from an evil ancient dragon, that has fallen to corruption, and abusing his power. But HOW will you do it? In this non-linear adventure, the choice is yours, on how th handle this situation. The game is an open-world, non-linear action rpg! (You can even MAKE your own character, from one of 10 pre-included races! That character can be male or female, of course.)Why else would I reccomend it? It's kinda obvious; ask the others, about why they would HIGHLY reccomend this game!Here's the basic idea, of what makes it GREAT:= Take down the powerful dragons, to unlock special powers, that your character learns, to use.= Decide how to handle various situations.= You can get followers by your side, to help deal with threats, that you can't handle, alone!= Be able to craft various things; most notably weapons, armor, and potions. (But this obviously ain't quite, like ""MineCraft""!)= A beautifully designed 3-D world, that you can travel through; even with dangers that get in the way, that you must deal with, in any way possible!= There can even be STEALTH based missions!= Finally, if you're lucky enough, to find such a quest, you can obtain POWERFUL, LEGENDARY ARTIFACTS, to use, as you see fit!----As of my advice, while it's a GREAT GAME, this enhanced version, for some reason, doesn't work on my Windows 10 PC, anymore. And every time I try to start it, it would just crash, and quit automatically.

That being said this game runs smoother and crashes far less than the origional Skyrim and that along with the fact it was free for ultimate edition owners makes it a great game to pick up.

It runs smoother, is less buggy,  more stable (especially if you're modding), and overall just looks better.  If you're buying Skyrim for the first time, get the Special Edition.  While not a significant graphics update, the performance improvements alone make it worth spending the extra $20 over the original; there's isn't much of a reason to get the original unless youreallywant to save some money.  The modding potential is also worth getting the Special Edition for, especially when the Script Extender is update to 64-bit; even without it, there's already some great gameplay and graphics mods out there.As far as the game itself...it's an amazing RPG.  The amount of things to do and explore, the detailed and complex lore, and the freedom you have with your character will have you sink countless hours into this game.  I bought it a year ago and it quickly became one of my favorite games.  Absolutely recommend it."

Ranging from the redefined forests all the way up to the mountains it truly brings back memories for the old players (including me) to getting the new players used to the gameplay for the new elder scrolls VI. This game is recommended to play and is a bargain considered that the old version with all the DLC's added would be a higher priced with lower quality textures and effects.

Odds are that you can make it look as good as, if not better than SSE. To be fair, some mods have already been converted for SSE, but there are, for now, not nearly as many mods.If mods aren't your cup of tea, however, this version looks slighlty better, I guess, so if that's all you want, go ahead. Still the same engine, though, so don't expect miracles.Since I prefer my heavily modded ""regular"" Skyrim, I can't recommend this, however. At least not for a long while.EDIT: In the light of paid mods resurfacing again, I can only shake my head in confusion and frustration. Did you learn nothing from the last time?"

I remember when I was but a young lad that thought lizards were cool and heavy armour was the best way to living dat sweet thug life. That all changed once I realized Farkas was an independent killing machine that didn't take no bull from no one. How was I supposed to tell the difference between friend and foe?Anyway, Skyrim is an open world single player RPG that can be played in both 1st and 3rd person perspective. But we all know 1st person is the best way to play because shooting someone with a bow in the 3rd person is like having mental retardation while tripping literal perspective mushrooms. So in my opinion, it's quite easy to get into how the world is and how the game feels. Unless you're a mage. Then prepare to be virtually spanked by every spell sponge elemental and literally every other mage out in the dank world we call Skyrim.Of course, you can play on the easiest difficulty the game has, which would be Novice. From that point, it should be smooth sailing. ""Should"", until you get ambushed by those snowy white ♥♥♥♥♥-cats in the snowy parts of Skyrim.OH WAIT! Every inch of Skyrim is covered in snow. Lel.Except Riften. Riften is a depressing hole of dead memes that creep up the political ladder of shove off in terms of being the origin of literally every bad rumor compared to the other Holds of Skyrim. Then again, Skyrim is a perfect example of a video game meme, so it makes sense for it to relate to the real world by being dead inside. Go figure.In the vast world of Bethesda Simulator, you will come across a wide variety of enemies to face. Some examples being draugyr, bandits, Thalmor, dragons, bears, witches, Thalmor, rats, cats, jumpscare bats, Thalmor, spooder man's babies, crippling depression, dank memes, and many more. Oh, and Thalmor. Thalmor are in there too.In terms of quests and story, The Clipping Textures V: Too Cool for Skoolrim doesn't disappoint because you will literally be hit with quests, where you will find quests for those quests which will then make babies out of those quests, but you then realize you can't get to those quests because you'll be too busy doing quests. Don't worry. Each quest is voiced by expert actors that are so professional, they voice the quest giver, enemies, guards, jarls, beggars, and so many more because they are such kind hearted individuals with only the intent to help the game blossom and allow the player to become so immersed in the fantastical world that is Skyrim 5: The Elder Rolls.Now, if you're getting this version of Skyrim, then you must have an idea as to how it was before this very special edition. Take everything I just said above and throw glitter on it. There you go. Pretty. But nah, in all seriousness, the original was out for so long that I still think it's the best because, wait for it.... MODS.Das right kiddies. Dem sweet mods. Be warned however. If you've no clue as to what I mean by ""mods"", be prepared to be scarred by female armour mods that look like they provide no armour in the science of physics sense, but have a higher value than Dragon and Daedric armour. Oh, and booby mods. Those still exist too. But hey, I am not one to judge the community on what they interpret as their way of improving the game. It's an open world for your personal enjoyment, so download what you want and prepare for possible frame drops, black screens, mod incompatibility crashes, and more Google search history related to fixing your Skyrim than your personal porn search history made out of plain curiosity.Special Edition has mods too. Pretty dang good ones at that. However, doesn't seem like it could beat the collection that grew from such a young age as the first edition of Skyrim's mods. So it's just personal preference at this point.Why am I reviewing it? Cause I never mentioned that I first played Skoyrim on my Xbox 360. I know. I was missing out.Not anymore though, so HAH.11 out of 10, would cap a Thalmor in the ear again."

,Recommended,489830,31718746,Posted: 13 May,all,blopenshtop,"I have no real complaints about this game, just a couple of things you should keep in mind before buying. After putting in around 700 hours of skyrim on the PS3 I was keen to mod it once I got a pc. I saw special edition as a simple way to mod legendary edition for cheaper. Turns out, I was not going in the right direction. SE at the moment only has about 6000 mods compared to regular skyrim with 53000. If you're just looking to play vanilla skyrim with slightly better graphics this is fine for the price compared to legendary edition, but it's definitely worth the extra money if you want to do serious modding.CPU: Intel core i7 7700 3.6GHzRAM: 8gb DDR4Graphics Card: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1060 G1 6GB"

Maybe it will encourage them to do it again for another title.64 bit & directx11 unlock the potential for modding in this game, MUCH more big fancy mesh spam, MUCH more AI processing, MUUUCH bigger textures and heavier shader use are possible.  Even ENBoosting the older engines only unlocked it's ability to decompress on multiple threads & at higher memory, compared to even an ideal skyrim 32bit install & hardware it's a massive improvement.  And Mods are being ported from 32 bit to 64 at a very good rate, mostly just waiting on SKSE but other dll loaders which accomplish similar things are already available now for SE.Having skyrim run as smooth as Witcher 3 on windows 10 was very much worth an extra 40 dollars for me, is basically what im saying here.

Other than that if you are too lazy to look for stuff type ""coc qasmoke"" (without the quotation marks) to go to a room with everything in the game and ""psb"" (again without the "") to get all shouts and magic which some might be bugged or crash your game but you are getting every shout in the game."

The launcher before you start the game has limited options to change aspect ratio up to 16:10 at 1680x1050. I have 21:9 running at 2560x1080, not supported. I changed the resolution manually in the Skyrimprefs.ini but couldn't really get it working right without strange graphical issues.

The game is pretty fun in some areas and sections but overall combat is just trigger spamming, or clicking attacks, not as many destructions spells I'd like I mean come on fire, lightning, and frost? Skill tree is too streamlined and over simplified thus making this game feel all too casual for veterans of the elder scrolls especially oblivion or even morrowind, there's no classes so to play as a play style you have to really restrict your character feasibility. Magic is overshadowed and very underwhelming such instances I was able to one hit kill powerful necromancers, or fire mages with one hit from my daedric sword so I feel weapons can overpower enemies constructed to magic or players who use magic can take serious hits but not fish it back as much. I wish classes were back especially in this installment I wish brawling was better in this game. Races are kind of cool but uninspiring and in a game with civil war unless you use mods or strictly play vanilla the civil war is limited to 3 holds that do battles and kill the enemy type quests. Overall this game does have some fun but it enough in my opinion and Bethesda needs to up their game."

Want to become a werewolf and eat their hearts? Easy as pie! You can do pretty much anything."

Really scummy of them to hide the original from the steam search, so you have to be linked to it. The main thing you'll miss out on is the mods, as a lot of creators still haven't ported them over. Not a bad game, I just don't support Bethesda doing this."

But remember that the special addition is better graphics and a little bit more dialogue. however it already includes all the downloadable DLC packages (which the original, including all the DLC packages is actually around $49.00), so if you're interested in a better looking version of the game without having to hassle with the extra cost and download time of the DLC, go for this version - but remember there aren't as many mods for the special addition (as of yet), however there are some pretty cool map extention mods, such as the Bruma mod (from Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion) and a few other graphical extension packs.If you ARE NOT interested in better graphics or extended DLC packages, by all means buy the basic version of the game. it is still very fun and definitely worth it because of all the available mods you can use.Link for original game:http://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/"

It also looks god damn beautiful in some scenes, and the gameplay is solid. The music composed for this game is awesome, the mods arent entirely gone but they arent prime either. I do play with the Unofficial Skyrim Patch, so I dont really run into any bugs.The inventory can be an♥♥♥♥♥sometimes.So, 20 bucks for the Special Edition on sale? Worth it without a doubt.Even the standard 40 is pretty good, but is a little pricey considering on PC 30$ under is the sweet spot, but its FRICCIN SKYRIM"

If you just want to play Skyrim's story and explore the default world and game, get the Special Edition. Apparently Bethesda hid the original version of Skyrim from the store. Their are people that can provide the link to the original in the review section (I don't have the link). Pretty great version of the game and I'd recommend it to people who just want to play regular Skyrim without mods."

Only downside is no SKYUI. Other than that it's better in every aspect.

,Recommended,489830,33989855,Posted: 3 August,all,Kaidenur,"Fantastic game, logged 300ish hours off-steam. World-building is truly fantastic. Fair bit of quest variation. Fetch quests get a bit stale, but stay fun.Replayability is a minor issue, though. I recommend trying a very different build when starting a new character, or one that really turns combat on its head. Try to never do an all-rounded build. A jack of all trades is a master of none, and with no weaknesses, there's no variability.However, there is little reason to but this over the original. The graphics and bugs can be modded, and if you buy at the right time, the DLC doesn't add much onto the price, assuming you even want it, seeing as two are basically just moreof what it already has, and the other isn't at all necessary.I love this game, but it might be a better idea to buy the original, depending on your needs.All-in-all, 91/100"

,Not Recommended,489830,34620996,Posted: 30 August,all,Drood,"Spent enough time in game to know I won't like it. The intro alone takes forever. God forbid you have to restart or try to tab out to watch something while they're talking.. Following characters seems to halt progression. Get three steps ahead of them and they stop. Take a turn, they stop. Repeat. I dunno. Just the beginning process deters me. Alt-tabbing is frustrating, even in windowed (with two monitors too).I like the fact that it's mod-friendly. Some of them made the scenery so much more beautiful, but a pretty game isn't the only thing to keep me interested. I've tried playing three separate occasions. Twice back when it was released on a friend's computer in...2011? Decided to give the updated version a try now while it was on sale. Spent much more time on it back then though. Just can't get into it without becoming annoyed by every little thing. Special edition seems true to the original.I've heard a lot of great things about the game, but it's just not my cup of tea. The slow pace is probably what gets me the most. If it takes more than a couple days of gameplay for me to find something to like about it, I know it's not for me. I should've taken a hint from the last time I sat for about 8 hours on this thing."
