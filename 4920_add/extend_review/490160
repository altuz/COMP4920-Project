,Recommended,490160,23559134,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","So, here we are again. Time Tenshi 2 is the sequel to Time Tenshi 1, and the first visual novel to be released by Silver Cow Studios on Steam that has an ending. It follows directly from the cliffhanger left by the first game, so playing the first game is recommended. It's about the same length as the first game and took me a little over 3 hours to finish, which seems to be the norm for this developer.But let's not beat around the bush here, that's not what you're here for. Time Tenshi has a decent story, but it's not a game about time travelling or paradoxes, it's a story about♥♥♥♥♥♥ Breasts. Boobs. Funbags. Cans. Hooters. Knockers. Mams. Moomoos. Udders. Handfuls. Gazongas. Sweater puppies. Twin peaks. Jugs. Chesticles. Dirty pillows. Meat mountains. Ballistics. Honkers. Headlights. Twins. Milkers. Tatas. Teats. Melons. Other words that mean big, wobbly woman meat. And in that regard the game is about the same as the first. It's enough to tease, but obviously you shouldn't expect anything too 18+, and later in the game there's a pretty big shift towards giantess content instead of just breasts.Overall, Time Tenshi 2 is pretty alright. I was glad it didn't just end with another cliffhanger like both of the developer's previous games, and even though the story still sometimes feels like an excuse to usher the player from one ecchi scene to the next it's not poorly written enough to make me want to skip through it. If you're here you probably already played the first game, though, so you probably don't really need me to tell you whether or not you'll be interested."

It keeps itself grounded with lots of dialogue and doesn't play all of its cards at once. The story will build up and then switch topics or scenes, perhaps not immediately getting you what you want, but it does this to make a more realistic story. It's a very interesting (and sexy) twist to the whole time travel thing, and it's backed up by interesting characters you'll come to actually care about. It's not just ecchi all the time, there's a lot of character building going on too. Sure, there are going to be gamers that will dismiss these characters immediately and disagree, but if that's the case then you're in the wrong neighborhood.It's got boobs, they're big. This is meant to be appealing. If you aren't interested in big anime breasts, then this visual novel will probably not appeal to you. And for that matter, if you're looking for porn or hentai, this game will also probably not appeal to you. It's certainly a niche title. And you should be able to tell from the art and screenshots if you're interested.It also has a lot of untapped potential, since the series poses questions, makes remarks about time travel, technology, biology and temporal anomalies. The Time Window is a mysterious marvel itself and despite being THE time machine, it's not entirely the focus of the story. The story's focus is more on character development as these interesting, amazing (and visually appealing) characters react to the unfolding events around them surrounding the Time Window device. It's got some interesting views on time travel and it's certainly got a unique twist on it.Some can claim the game is short. If you're clicking through the story and just looking at the art, or going for ""the sexy bits"" you're probably not getting what you should out of the game. It's a read. It's meant to be leisurely and fun.  It took me 4 hours to get through it all and I probably didn't have to do it in one sitting, but I did. I was hooked. I can't wait to see more. Having played and beaten both games, I just feel like I haven't gotten enough. I wanna know what more happens to Tensai, Kyo, Rose, Michelle and Kenji.The breast expansion was the appeal picking the game up, but the story endeared itself to me and now I'm hooked. Definitely a fan."

BGM was just as great as it was on the first Time Tenshi (and once more, I’ll ask: please release this game’s soundtrack! The songs are really catchy).This was a fairly good sequel, with a lot of fanservice (of course, this is the essence of this game — if you’re looking for a “deeper story” you’ll probably be disappointed with TT1 and 2). Like the first VN, it surprises me that the story itself isn’t that bad, and it goes smoothly without becoming boring.5/10.Some of the descriptions were really cheesy and laughable, like describing boobs by saying “mammoth mammary mountains”… lol"
,Recommended,490160,23591937,"Posted: 15 June, 2016",all,Zandre,"This is of course a visual novel, not a game for those of you who are unsure. There are currently only about 2 options throughout the game so for the most part, the story is linear.That being said, if you own Time Tenshi 1, I would highly recommend this game because it has everything from the first game with a bunch of improvements. Most of the growth scenes are ""animated."" They're mostly just gif level, but I was very suprised by this aspect.If you don't own the first game, I would recommend playing the first game. It has quite a bit important character development and explains a lot of things that may not make sense (although, we all probably get lost in the time travel ""explanations"" a bit). It is not technically a hentai game as there is no ""sex"" or actual nudity, but it is still a pretty high quality visual novel that deals with a lot of BE.Overall, I really loved this game and I sincerely hope they continue the story as it looks to be hitting a very interesting point. The overall story was very interesting and definitely was unexpected imo. Furthermore, I loved that the growth of the girls seemed to be frequent and when you least expected it.With some hope, and a sequal, I hope they make full animated movements like many top quality graphic novels these days, but I highly recommend this to giantess and BE lovers. Hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did!"

Entertaining for a few hours.  Some voice acting would be nice.  If  you like nothing but boobs you should be happy.The only negative strike on this game is how the devs handle policy.  They don't tell you up front that they have a YT policy.  If you plan to post videos on Youtube be sure to read their policy under dicussion.  If not you might end up with a surprise message from Silver cow and your videos will flagged."

Yes.For all the juvenile pleasures the game(?) delivers, it is still surprisingly respectable.The overall production quality is greatly improved from the prequel ( if they can keep that trend up, they have a bright future) and I have to say that I find myself really enjoying the plot (seriously, it's not too bad, I hope the devs can keep respecting thier own writing).As for improvements: I understand that a ""visual novel"" is essentialy a self-reading comic book, but more choices and paths would really expand the game (yes, this makes development and writing MUCH harder, but anything worth doing is hard).Also, they need a LOT more art and portrait variance; MOST of the draw of the game is the character portraiture and descriptions-- and they seldom match. Yes this is because the characters are constantly changing, but you don't actually get much of a sense of that from the art. The art quality itself has also improved from teh prequel, but they will have to keep improving it to expand the series further.Animation is hard, but it may be neccessary for what the devs have intended here. And given the nature of the plot, I can see how they may have to start writing unnofficial patches to still get this on steam.Still, I actually respect the game and the devs. I hope to see a sequel some day."

I wished the artwork was more consistent and, on average, a higher quality. I wished the boobs were bigger. I got both of those in Time Tenshi 2.I was loving this for a while. Then there's this big muscle girl which soured me. They kept mentioning boobs getting bigger, but they would return to previous size when warping back to their hub and only grow to a size already seen when they warped out again.So yea. I enjoyed it, but it's bittersweet. I wish the boobs would actually grow consistently throughout, there weren't female body builders on my screen long enough to keep it on my mind the rest of the game, and that the boobs largest size was bigger.I do recommend it, but I don't know if I'll be as optimistic about a third installment as I was this one."

One of the few I actually played (mainly because the others are a bit pricy, this one wasn't really). I have thoroughly enjoyed Time Tenshi, Time Tenshi 2 with DLC, and Busted. For Time Tenshi, the story was really well done; it was a rather interesting take the sci-fi concept of time machines and time travellers with an anime twist. Kyo was probably my favorite character, I'd say. I wouldn't mind there being a Time Tenshi 3 or a whole series of games involving these characters and future additons. From what I've seen in Busted, there are characters that may show up in other games by Silver Cow Studios.Overall though, this was probably the most interesting visual novel game I've played. While I'm not very partial to the genre itself, this is one of the few games that made me want to play a novel game. There are others, but this was the first and best one I've played so far."

More endings.Easy to play.Cute girls. Except one of them.Cons:I was promised nudity, but there was only hair covered boobs. That's almost as much as what I see when I walk on the beach.Story started making no sense, but then again it is time travel. Moebius cosplay?Giantess not really my thing.Recommended."
,Recommended,490160,23797137,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,ManaAlchemist,"Being a huge fan of anime style Visual Novel games, and big breasts (and breast expansion), I was a fan of the first Time Tenshi game. Sure it was nowhere near being the best, but it was enjoyable for what it was. So of course I wanted to get the sequel, and it did improve certain things.Like the first game, Time Tenshi 2 is short enough to be played through in one sitting (i think it took me around 3 hours), and also like the first game, it had only 2 choices to be made (unless i remember wrong). So if you're looking for a VN with more interaction, this is probably not worth the time.The art was definitely more consistent this time, and people like me who love anime/manga style artwork it's great.Also the game has some ""animation"" when it comes to the breast expansions and growth which is very simple stuff, but still great and i found it to be quite hot. It's a bit dissapointing that the breasts keep shrinking back when they return to the base, but I suppose they don't want to make the breasts big enough so that the girls would be unable to move around.The story continues from the first game, and short as it is, I don't really think much can be said without spoiling it, but it flowed well and was completly fine. And the music of the game is quite good.So it's a game I'd recommend if you like anime style VN's with big boobs, extremely simple story and if you're fine with it just being ""ecchi"" and not real ""hentai"".Also if you're a fan of giantesses and giantess growth, I really recommend the game! A couple of the girls grow into fine giantesses, which is one thing that makes me love the game. I love giantesses and growing females so damn much, so that they added them makes me love the game developers, as there's to little giantess stuff in this world. There's unfortunatly not a lot of scenes with them in the game, but I found them all to be great.Now If a third game gets made I would really hope that they start letting the girls keep their expanded breast sizes, and let them keep growing through the story. Also more giantesses please! And bigger giantesses please, preferably with boobs bigger than the sun :D. But for now, this game is, as I've mentioned, an enjoyable story if you like big boobs and breast expansion (and giantesses :D)."

I assure you, they are VERY VERY large. But it works, somehow. Great V. Novel, good endings, some lack of unique art when it came to accessories being added in the game, but that's warranted. Did I mention BIG BOOBIES? Though my question still stands. When Tensai stays in the room when the girls are horny af, what actually goes down?"

I have gone back and replayed the first one at the ending of the alternate ending, and then launching Time Tenshi 2 and it still starts me with the other ending.I'm trying to say the above with the least spoilers obviously.

It took everything we perverted fans loved and added more to it!I'm a big fan of BE, so I was very happy to see a lot of it in TT2. However, It would've been nice to see some variance to this already rare genre. Slower growth process going on throughout the story would be great or perhaps having the BE overlap from one time trip to another. I'd love to read a scene that talks about the girls not being able to go back to the size they were before. Just a suggestion :) The warping of the drawings in the first few time travel scenes was a notable first step towards a needed animation upgrade. My hopes are that your budget will improve enough so that the possible TT3 will have more drawings that describe the BE process and 'motion' of their assets ;)In regards to the size of these girl's chests, well, Silver Cow Studios doesn't hold back at all in that regard. They did a great job illustrating their story as an indie company. Dare I say that I hope in Time Tenshi 3 they get... even bigger?! This fan wishes so!My hopes in the future are that we can receive a game with more overall quality animation involved, more scenes where the girls talk more about their bodies(because it's just plain sexy), and of course even more BE and bigger curves!Great job, Silver Cow Studios!"

It adds some new faces while keeping the old cast in place.  It has twists and surprises along the way with very cute anime tropes sprinkled throughout the dialogue.And yes while it looks vapid and silly this version has better art, animation and  story elements that outshine the first debut game.  If every game was black listed for having young busty teens as the main characters and capable of combat and hard sciences, then nearly 80% of all jrpg's would be blacklisted.  This is one that should not be judged by appearences alone.  For those who like busty anime girls and science fiction, it's worth a look.I enjoyed this game even more than the first and would purchase a third title if they release one."
