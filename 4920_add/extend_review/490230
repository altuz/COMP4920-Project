,Recommended,490230,32270162,Posted: 8 June,all,BlankaBun,"SwarmRiders is a 100% free very short & small bonus for fans of the UberMosh series in the form of a endless runner, endless mob type deal mashup.I have no complaints, it's just a very simple and quick free game with a target demographic at ubermosh fans. (Can technically be 100%'d within 160 seconds, assuming perfection upon first try. Took me around 30 minutes)Music is great and doesn't get too repetitive, which I expected but was glad it didn't.Solid recommendation to anyone looking to try it out."

Future generations must learn, and take heed of lessons learned of events foretold by the ancients. To those unexposed to what transpired here, it will not be forgotten.WELCOME TOZIONUBERMOSHSWARMRIDERSis a free to play version of ubermosh, twin stick shooter, slightly simplified. You are constantly driving to the Southeast and destroying what is left of the seemingly real world Sentinels.With the illusory veil shattered in the afterglow of the UBERMOSH arena, the true nature of the world exposed. We must start again.Follow my curation page for more."

,Recommended,490230,29769227,Posted: 7 February,all,wolfcub46,"I really enjoyed this game as it was something different that branches of from the main series itself. I myself played for ten minutes and got all the achievements, but it was really fun! It's free so don't be afraid to play a little bit of it. The other thing I liked about this game is the OST which is amazing like the other games!"

,Not Recommended,490230,31652820,Posted: 9 May,all,TDogInOpen,"I really wanted to like this game. I really did. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy my playtime very much but saddly it was just too short of a playtime. This game lacks the idiotic joy and replayability of playing any of the Ubermosh games and the achievements are very easy to get. It's not a bad game in my point of view, just unfinished. Sure it's a free game, but a little more effort could have been warrented.4.9/10"
