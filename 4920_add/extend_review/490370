In fact, it is my favourite PC game ever developed, and that still holds true to this very day!Do not let the time I've played fool you. Since Release day in 1999, I have clocked well over 1,000+ hours of IG2 game time. Between C&C Tiberian Sun & C&C Red Alert 2, I almost nearly played nothing but this game for hours upon hours at a time, and would marathon the campaigns every weekend. It really is that good!Imperium Galactica 2 was a game well ahead of it's time. I would argue that in 4X terms, it is still very much unrivalled 17 years later. The presentation, mechanics, soundtrack, battles etc, set a bar that hasn't really ever been beaten. As of today IG2 still has the best colony management, the best planetary battles, one of the best diplomacy mechanics, an unrivalled Spy & Espionage system and a ship and ground force customisation that took the 4X genre years to even get close to rivaling.There are exceptions. The Endless Space series, which in terms of presentation, is just gorgeous! Stellaris has probably beaten it in Soundtrack terms, and many 4X games do have a larger scope for their Star Maps these days. But in terms of the overall package, Imperium Galactica 2 still stands the tallest amongst the younger giants of the industry and has aged incredibly well.This is quite simply one game you need to have in your Steam library if you even care about 4X titles!"

Find your Imperium Galactica II Steam folder (H:\Program\Steam\steamapps\common\Imperium Galactica II)2. Open in notepad the ig2 file that is of type ""SETTINGS""3. Change the language based on your preference4. Change the window dimensions based on your preference5. Enjoy the gameAs stated by Mordenknen:I think by default the resolution shows:#window dimensions\\width=1080\\height=768You need to remove the \\ as well as change the numbers. So it would look like this:#window dimensionswidth=1920height=1080"
,Recommended,490370,29361997,Posted: 19 January,all,DDay,"Back in the day the original Imperium Galactica was the best 4x game (Obviously my opinion), Then when Imperium Galactica 2 came out it kind of missed it mark with less story telling and less immersion with the removal of the bridge interface, But added random events, multiple species for you to be and mutiplayer.Even tho it missed it's mark it still satnds to be overall a solid 4X game.The cons I can see now, as I jump back in to this game with limited play, The games interface is lacking and most things are done faster with the F1 to F12 keys this was fine at the time (even more so since the game came with overley to go over your keyboard) but now it's dated and makes it hard to play. Also will like to note for some reason 1-3 keys and spacebar don't seem to work and they are needed for fast on the fly in game speed adjustments for when you need to make an action or strategies since clicking on the icon is painfully slow.I mainly bought this in hopes to see a ture imperial galactica 3 (I will not recognize Nexus: The Jupiter Incident) since imperial galactica is now out of legal limbo with disputes on who owns the rights for this franchise."

76561197963323627,Recommended,490370,31857307,Posted: 20 May,all,A player has no name,"One of the most addictive games I've ever played. On one level I hate this game because of the amount of hours I've sat glued to it, getting my ass kicked over and over again (my actual playtime is higher since I played this before it came on Steam). I'd say if you have problems with losing all sense of time when you play games, and might lose an entire week, then tread carefully with this one.The good:Overall averycompelling simulation.The game is filled with interesting choices and trade-offs...Do you choose to spend your resources expanding to new planets, or defending the ones you have? Do you spend extra to speed up research, or do you hold off on research to build a bigger fleet of ships? Another choice is taxation, if you set lower taxes you make less money each month, but your population grows faster which allows for more buildings and can pay off later when you turn the taxes back up.There are more choices like that, but it'd be a bit tedious to list them all.Suffice it to say there's a lot to play around with, and you might wonder, whilenotplaying, whether a certain strategy might work.It's an old game, and the graphics are predictably dated, but you're zoomed out on everything 99% of the time anyway, so you won't really care how simple the models are. The engine update for the Steam version allows the game to run at modern resolutions, I'm running it at 2560x1080 with no problems, which is a hell of a nice change from the original.The bad:The AI - though effective enough to be challenging - is disappointingly stupid. You apparently aren't worth allying with unless your fleet is above a certain strength. Potential allies will ignore the fact that they're at war with another faction and need your help. This limits the kind of teaming up you can do.The path-finding is the worst I've ever seen in any game. eg. Groups of tanks can't move because they're bumping into each other. The game features very narrow streets that can only fit one tank at a time, so obviously this is a nightmare.The only viable tactic is ""expand-or-die"", which takes a lot of options off the table.Long games where you don't find out how badly you screwed up until about an hour in. Which can get extremely frustrating.The overall campaign is driven by events that are (IMO) weirdly timed, and can completely screw your run.Sometimes the game will randomly crash, other times I can play it all day without crashing once.I've only attempted it a few times, but multi-player seems completely non-functioning (as other reviews also pointed out)... it doesn't factor into my rating, because I don't really care about multiplayer, but be warned.Seemingly not much (if any) activity from the devs these days.Other minor things that don't work, or work badly.Definitely a cult classic. There are very few games like this."

The second I saw it on Steam, I bought it, such is my love of this game. Sadly, the original disc version I had suffered terribly from crashes, bugs and compatibility issues with recent operating systems, making it difficult to actually play. To my great surprise, the game has resurfaced and has been remastered here, fixing said issues and looking and playing better than ever. The game itself had a lot to offer back in 1999, including tactical space and ground combat, espionage, diplomacy, empire management, multiplayer and different races, offering huge replayability, with no two games ever the same.There is a campaign mode, in which you can choose one of three races, each have their own advantages and disadvantages, design and unique storyline. There are random events in this mode, such as pirate attacks, asteroid showers, earthquakes, sabotage and rescue missions, and they vary each game, meaning no two games are the same.The three campaign races are:Kra'hen - Ruthless and savage warriors who have the best army and ship/tank production, but with no access to spies or the possibility of diplomacy with other races.Shinari - A race with weaker army capabilities, but superior espionage and diplomatic skills.Solarians - The Human race, who are average in every area except research, which they excel in.There is also a skirmish mode, which lets you play as civilisations not playable in the campaign, with control over different elements of gameplay, such as amount of players, map size, population etc, as well as pre-set missions with varying difficulties.This version has support for more modern screen resolutions and aspect ratios, and features better graphics and game engine than the original. I honestly feel that this game is a true classic, and remastered to be better than ever, thus if you are a fan of this type of game, I feel it is well worth the asking price to experience this gem of the golden gaming era of the late 90's.Credit to steam user von_krysiak for the following technical information he/she included in his/her review, which can be found here:https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006086992/recommended/490370/I felt I'd include his/her technical note to aid to anyone encountering this problem:IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTE: Graphic settings are lacking in this port and if you have any issues you have to change them through the ig2.settings.cfg file in the main game directory.

Extensive sandbox style colony building, customisation of ship loadouts, heros and Ship Captains with special skills for your fleets, intractive diplomacy, spying and covert operations. Tactical real time ship to ship combat and ground combat. Excellent fun.You are given a Choice of 3 races, each one with a different emphasis and their own *campaign* with random elements thrown in requiring a different style of play each time and giving great replayability.Imo a lot of current developers could LEARN A LOT from how games like this were put together.

That being said there are a few annoying bugs that I hope can be addressed via a patch.  First off the 1-3 and spacebar keys do not control the game speed.  I am not the only one to experience this issue (there is a discussion thread on the community page).  Also, the mouse will not let you pan side to side on the planet or starmap.  Up and down is fine, but in order to move side to side you have to click the minimap.  Neither of these issues are fatal, far from it.  The game runs pretty much flawlessly and has aged quite well (I love the sound track!).  I'm just hoping someone at the publisher is reading steam reviews and can implement a solution."

In this version you can not even access the graphic option as per the help menu tells you. You start off more active buildings than the original, meet the pirates much sooner with little to no chance at all to have a reasonable chance of survival. To be honest, I have the original, and seeing the hack job on this makes me want to go an find an old system and boot it up on Windows 98 just to have a good old fashion fun fest with a good title. I think while I'm at it load up Emperor of The Fading Sun as well. Outside of the Civ series there just isn't much anymore to hold my interest except maybe Pirates, or live on-line battles you can sink your teeth into without losing playability. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS VERSION, but in the spirit of the game cannot condemn it either. I can only hope that this is updated and repaired to its origional state.

,Recommended,490370,29802175,Posted: 9 February,all,^9UK ' ^3Y^9our Mum,"This is one of the finest games in the RTS genre, successfully defining and refining an excellent balance of features and accessibility that would be copied by dozens of 4X developers up to the present day.This game has everything you need from a sci-fi RTS:- A decent research tree (three competing branches)- Customisable ship designs (without being too overwhelming)- Colony management, customise your planets with ease to focus on taxes, production, research, defenses etc.- Engaging tactical battles (without unnecessary complexity)- Meaningful diplomacy options, combined with meaningful espionage possibilities.- Unique factions with reasonably balanced Asymmetry.- Interesting ships-and-tanks market not seen in many other games.The only downsides at the moment are:- Steam version does not come with a manual, meaning you will probably spend the first 10 minutes of a game reading through the research panel to find out what each thing does, or checking online for keyboard commands.- undocumented mouse control can hinder play (hit ALT to toggle ""attack/merge"" mouse behaviour on galaxy map)- Minor balance issues that make some units a bit of a dead-end investment (Space Bases, ""Mobile Base"", planetary guns).To top off all the positives, this game is well optimised. The tactical battles and colonies are rendered in full 3D, with decent effects, and yet still runs perfectly on my i3, 3GB RAM laptop from 2009. I have yet to test the multiplayer but It's something I've been looking forward to for nearly a decade!Top game, highly recommend for any fans of 4X / sci-fi RTS."

Got me into RTS / city building games but no other games come close to these ones. The cool mix of real-time empire management and micromanaging battles was completely unique. As some have pointed out there are some issues with this version namely:- Having to hold spacebar to send your ships to do something other than move, so attacking or combining fleets for example - I only figured this out by trial and error of keys- Unable to control speed of time with shortcuts like the original (1 2 3 keys)- Lack of GUI to edit the graphicsFacets I'd like to see improved either in a patch or in a new version of the game- Really digged the aspect of progression from the first IG with the bridge changing as you were 'promoted' in the game.- Micro management of planets got a little frustrating at later stages of the game. Having auto-build enabled was useful to a degree but there needs to be more customization options - for instance, specifying that you want auto build of only a certain type of research center rather than have auto build build all types of research- Smarter AI and balacing, this is more of a sign of the games age more than anything elseThanks THQ Nordic for allowing me to relive these classics!"

,Recommended,490370,31870990,Posted: 20 May,all,Asmo6035,"Imperium Galactica II is one of my all time favorite space strategy games. While it is an older game and may not be everyone's cup of tea, I think it has some great elements that make it fun to play.One of the things I've always hated about other games in this genre are the hard and/or arbitrary caps placed on fleet and army sizes. Many games go with a hard cap which really removes the realism from the game, while others add a maintenance cost to your armies, placing a maximum cap on their number and size based on how much you can afford. And even though it may not be as realistic, it is way more fun to create trenendous fleets to wipe our your enemies. There is something very satisfying when you see each of your 50 planets producing ships in real time and sending them all to a single point in space.I have played some of the storyline games as well, and I think that they are compelling and make sense. The research trees are rewarding, and the fact that you can micromanage your planets if you like is great.I would say that a downside in the management aspect of the game are the sheer number of planets that you would have to manage. The game also does not ""upgrade"" buildings to higher forms, so you would have to manually go to every planet and delete older buildings in order to have them automatically replaced with the upgraded models. That's a little frustrating. However, beyond your first few planets, you can get away with letting the computer manage them all.One further downside would be that certain races are very exploitable, and can take out thousands of ships with only a handful of their own. That was a really frustrating experience the first few times it happened to me. Very rewarding from the other side though :)I would say this game is definitely worth picking up, even though it is quite old at this point -- the gameplay is still solid, even if the concepts/genre and graphics are a bit dated."

But I love how you can download and install your games on STEAM (rather than carrying all your CDs) if you're mobile like me so I had to re-purchase this game online. The graphics are dated (obviously) but gameplay is still enjoyable. I still recommend it.

Not only does this game provide freedoms (not limited to turn based nor where your ships go) but you are able to build/battle on colonies.  Although you can auto so much there is a bit of fun in building them your way.  You can do spys/diplomacy which again very simple and not over complicated.  The story is pretty good.  I played this back in it's original form and was great then and great now.  If only they made a decent updated version.  Sadly the closest this has is Orion and that is turn based...

I stopped being able to play my original version years ago when operating systems were no longer compatible.The only issue I had with the game was the graphics resolution setting. I made some changes to ""C:\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\Imperium Galactica II\ig2.settings"" with NotePad as follows:#window dimensionswidth=1920height=1080I took out the ""//"" before width and height and entered my computers current resolution setting. The results were perfect.I also saw some comments that the game was touch screen required. This is not true, my mouse worked fine, in fact it feels just like the original game. I understand the mouse doesn't work if you have more than one monitor, so a solution for you multi monitor peeps may be to disconnect one for gaming.Hope my review helps people having trouble with the resolution.Bless ya!"

IG2a Is a game that has kept me coming back for over a decade. It is the meter by which I have measured every successive wave of Space 4x games. It provides you with a solid 4x blend from founding and managing colonies to outfitting your fleets for war. The Espionage is perhaps the most satisfying I have encountered. The diplomacy and story are shallower than might be seen in more recent titles, but the random events keep the challenges coming as you struggle to manage your empire frome a single system to a sprawling superpower. Ultimately, this game will leave you longing for a thrid installment in the franchise.The game is nearly 20 years old as of the writing of this review, and as such lacks some of the depth and visual polish that you find in more recent titles. Nevertheless, it is well worth the price for anyone who does not mind its age."

I play a number of strategy games, some real time, and some turn based, and this game has elements of both.  You can pause it while you are thinking and making decisions, or you can let the battles you have run real time without the pause.  From building your base on a planet, to designing your ships, upgrading your weaponry, spying and trying diplomacy, this game seems to have it all.  It also does not have horrible graphics for as old as it is, and I found a fix to run it at my monitor's resolution of 1920x1080.  Highly recommend it if you are a strategy game fan!"

In fact I have worn out 4 cd's because of playing, SO I have played this game tons, ad still love it.Most of the negativity that you read comes from port problems and dificulty for the game to rcapture the mouse correctly.  I WON'T give them a  bad review because it honestly seems like they are working to fix these problems.  I did have a list of small problems that they could fix (little tweaks here and there), and fix to problems so the hotkeys worked etc.  Turns out nearly ALL were fixed in the last update.There still is a few minor problems, but they will probably be getting fxed soon.   There is still a problem of the program capturing the mouse, I have found that if you have a fleet selected, then press the middle mouse buttons, that seems to fix it.  let me know if you understand what I am saying, if not I will try to explain beter.Any other problem I beleive will get fixed soon, so don't be scared away cause of a few bad reviews.  It is still an amazing game.Also, spy leveling actually functions correctly in this game, as opposed to the originals (before you couldn't increase a spys stats (other than loyalty), now you can level them and increase all the stats as you see fit."

Being 1999 IG2 was actually one of the first 3D strategy games ever made which was quite an achievement from the small Hungarian studio Digital Reality. I've created aImperium Galactica Legacy Websitethat tributes IG and looks at the most similar games out there if that's of interest to anyone. But nothing really comes close to IG as it truly is a one of kind hybrid series.IG2 improves upon IG1 in many areas. You can play as 3 different races across 3 epic campaigns with literally hours of cinematic videos spread across each story. The FMV cutscenes were very realistic for the time as you can tell Digital Reality had really got into the groove with video making (the dramatic wormhole intro still gives me goosebumps to this day!). The 3D in-game graphics was equally amazing as now the galaxy map, planet surface view and space battle view was truly 3D allowing you to rotate and zoom in any direction. A fully 3D galaxy to conquer is something many modern TBS space games still don't do, and seeing the clouds and sunsets over your planet cities still looks incredible to this day, the space battles were equally impressive especially when in orbit of a planet as the orbiting ships and surface batteries literally battled through the clouds.I loved how you could zoom in on a star and see your planet circling it and if you left clicked on its stats you could zoom into orbit of the planet to view all the space stations above the clouds. Battles also had this seamless cool zooming in from main galaxy effect adding even more to the game's immersion. Ship design and configuration was enhanced plus new Spy management and Trade port screens were added to the game. Ground combat was expanded too with more unit and defence building types. You could even build support tanks to order awesome fighter and orbital bombardment strikes during the battles. Also finally added was a full skirmish and scenario mode allowing fans to play the sandbox galaxy conquering games they couldn't play in IG1.IG2 had become a forgotten classic however Digital Reality in their final years enhanced and rereleased the game on Ipad. Now in 2017 THQ Nordic have taken that IG2 enhanced version and rereleased it on PC Steam, GoG & even mobile phones! This version has updated graphics, supports all modern HD resolutions, and with some nice force applied anti-aliasing & antistrophic filtering the game still looks pretty good after all these years. Even more amazing is that THQ Nordic are still patching the game with new updates and fixes! I strongly suggest you check it out!I made some videos showing off this updated version here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGouCiy95_Yhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcfRSnE7jHM"

I remember putting a LOT of hours into this title in middle school and even in high school on the iPad edition.  I was always irritated that the pc version never had a digital release...until now!! To me, this game feels like one of the early Total War titles I love so much, except set in space (which is freakin awesome).  The battles are much more simple than a total war game, but the economy building and empire management is more in depth while remaining easy to understand.  Plus there is the ship customization, which lets you determine what class ship has what loadout (same with ground forces).  Excellent game, I can't even begin to sum it up well enough, look up more stuff online if you're interested.  It's quite the hidden gem!"

Not only that, it's the only game I've played in Hungarian in this millennia. :DI've been looking for a replacement for a long long time, but so far nothing could beat this game in terms overall experience (Nexus: The Jupiter Incident was a nice try, but didn't really manage to grasp me). The fact that we can still play this amazing game on the latest operating systems is awesome, I think I'm going to put more hours into it.Be aware that there a few kinks to iron out though: Graphics settings can be edited in a text file instead of an in-game menu, some gameplay settings seem to be ineffective, keyboard shortcuts aren't all working (time speed change (except pause), zoom). Despite these, the game is absolutely playable.Also: They added a side menu on both sides (you can enable it in the settings file) for the game features that you can also access with F1 through F10, which is a really nice addition.-----UPDATE for Patch #1 (2017-01-28): The issues above are fixed, great work! The quick research menu (next to the message bar on the top) is missing though, if that was added, then it's absolutely 100% must buy (without it, it's just 99%).And there's something I realised just now: In window mode, this game has responsive/adaptive design!

I have been waiting for a game like this since it faded into the past... Companies tried and tried to create something like this, but somehow in the end they always missed something and ended up with a bad or at least not that great product. I have tried all 4X space games but none could compete with the overall gameplay of IG2.This has colony management, empire management, fleet management, research, ship and tank scheme planner, diplomacy, spying, trading. Space and land battles.And what is really important: It is simple, easy to use, not that difficult to master. The whole point where other 4x space games got lost for me was that... they were just way too complex to get into. As a casual gamer who works a lot, it is important to get started quickly and not getting lost in the details for 2-3hours in the begining.Overall: If you don't mind that the graphics are old (actually better than its own time) you should definetely try this game, it will consume many many hours of your life. :)"

It's very simple at first glance, but has a ton of different ways it can be played. Doesn't get too bogged down in micro-management, and most importantly doesn't feel like a spreadsheet. Really fun. Combat while (again) simple at first has tactical depth to it and becomes very interesting with tech advances.And now for the complaints...I don't remember it being this buggy back in the day...it crashed a few times and I get a fps hit on the colony screen when it's raining. The sound cuts out, too. As for the actual gameplay, while the various races are diverse and fun to play, diplomacy can be underwhelming. Also while the unique ship models for each race are one of the games strongest points, all the buildings look the same (like regular human buildings) so it makes playing as aliens much less immersive.I wish the auto-build feature was set to 'none' by default. I normally don't use it because I like having full control over cash use. It can be repetitive going through each colony screen every few years towards the end of the game to see what needs building. Could have been implemented better.It's too bad there was never an IG3. There's a really great formula here that could be improved upon further."

Didn't take me long to remember why I stopped playing it. There are only three difficulty levels - Easy, Normal, Hard. Play it on Easy and it's almost boring. Play it on Normal and it's frustrating to the point where I will once again just stop playing it. Fantastic basic concept and design of a game. But the developers really messed up on the difficulty settings. If Easy is difficulty 1, Normal is difficulty 50. All these years later I'm once again saying that it's ridiculous that bumping up the difficulty just one notch requires playing an absolutely PERFECT game, which I've never been able to do. So disappointed that through all the years no one has ever gone in and tweeked that difficulty level thingy. Fun game to have and to play.

Yes, it is still hard on any difficulty other than Easy.Yes, I still love it to pieces.I seriously cannot even begin to guess how many gameplay hours I put into this game many years ago when it was just a 4 disc game.  Taking over the galaxy on Easy only to get stomped when I played on Normal. Ha, I also remember playing my buddy in multiplayer at his place for who knows how long (gifted him the game, in fact). Sure, I could complain about a few annoyances here and there with respects to the gameplay and bugs, but honestly? This game is almost the same as it was before. Either you loved it, or you left never to return.One early difference I need to mention though....when you pull up the game for the first time off steam you'll notice your screen is REALLY zoomed in. It took me a few minutes, but thanks to the internet and my own tinkering, I quickly realized a couple changes in resolution in the game file fixed that.  Don't ask me what file it was (I already forgot lol), just search the internet. It'll become clear quickly enough.If you're a first timer on this game, go in with an open mind, and remember this is a *reboot* of an older game. It's got something for almost everyone: colony and economy building/management, technology/research, a big galaxy to play in, plenty of rivals to play diplomat or war with, military in the form of spaceships and tanks, random(ish) events, and even a spy network you can invest in if that's more your thing (I usually just use them for counter intelligence XD). I will caution you though, to play your first games on Easy. The Normal in this game isn't a joke, and even I fail it about half or so of the time. Hard? Beat it once, and I have still no idea how the heck I pulled it off.And if the 3 major campaigns aren't your thing, or you're bored of them, there are also a handful of scenarios to mess about with too.Maybe we'll see another one of these titles someday. Until then, I'll keep popping by this one time and again.Cheers, and good hunting!"
