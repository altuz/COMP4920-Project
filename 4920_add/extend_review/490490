It's hilarious and fun. Lots of fun gun mechanics to swap out and play around with.However, be warned: this game is like the games of that period... in that it is super hard. Think Contra hard.Summarily, this is a bullet-hell 80's sci-fi tron-style shoot-em-up. Great fun."

If you like shooting just buy it. ( Also if you have VR :D )For general :+ Nice visuals+ Weapon handling and crafting your weapon"

,Recommended,490490,35015290,Posted: 16 September,all,Craig1287,"Yes, it's a standing wave shooter, but it's one of the best out there. It manages to take the gameplay of a bullet Hell game and fit it to a FPS game in VR. Also, the style and humor add a whole lot of charm to it. Another plus is the weapon design aspects. You can really make your gun act the way you want it to by picking the base frame, barrel, magazine, projectile type and more. These impact what is shot from the gun, how fast it shoots (cycles), the speed of the projectile, it's spread, how many projectiles are shot at a time, if you manually reload or if it charges over time, the capacity, if it explodes with AoE damage, if you have a laser sight, and more. Also, you get different shields that act differently.Overall, there's a good bit of polished content here and most importantly it's a lot of fun."

Simple gameplay, an old-school shoot em up but in VR. I love the gun construction, really gives a personal touch to the way it's played. The game does not take itself too seriously, the voice acting is fitting and humourous adding to the retro theme, Alwyn will keep you entertained as you blast his creations with your chosen weapon.The game is probably a little tough, at least for me, but it's interesting and although similar to other games I think it brings something new to this kind of VR game. Being early access, I'm confident that more content will be added to really seperate this game from anything else out there."

This isn't just some bullet spam game that slaps that genre tag on to sound hard. You need to quickly and carefully position enemy bullet waves to create openings that allow you to safely slide through, all while quickly identifying the most threatening enemy in the huge horde and killing them quickly.I know VR wave shooters are pretty much a dime-a-dozen at this point, but this one more than stands out, and is worth the price tag even with the limited content available."

I find it bigger than in spt for the same surface.As someone said it's really a projectile rain so it is sport!You really have a badass attitude and progress at everygame.Less frustration than an spt which is more exigent and sad.And even if it's a projectiles rain, it's still possible to manage. It not a mess like in serious sam.Very well polished, and fun. A lot of pleasure to play this game. It provides a good positive vibe.It's really enjoyable.The sense of humour is inside the whole design of the game, it's not dark or serious or horrific and it provides to the player a nice moment of gaming. But beware it is not an easy game, it requires a lot of reflex and attention. If you want to be on the leaderboard you will need skills.Having an ennemy hitting me and telling me *Go play Mario* with his alien voice is just wtf.Every sentence said by the AI is cool and given time to time, no flood, not boring.This game has a soul, and I am totally in phase with it."

As you progress through the ""campaign"" you unlock more shield types and components for the weapon customization. As you make kills, your weapons special ability charges - this brief effect (also customizable) can be anything from a powerful ray to invulnerability.There are 4 levels in the campaign, each ending with a boss fight. Once a level is unlocked, you can also play it in endless mode. On top of that there's a challenge mode which runs for a few days, with a predetermined weapon and shield. There are global leaderboards for all levels/modes.PROSVaried enemy types.The boss fights.The weapon customization.The deflection shield is actually useful.CONSNo loadout, no dual wielding - just a gun and a shield.Gameplay a bit on the slow side.One particular enemy spawns silently and cannot be dodged nor shield blocked - feels unfair and annoying.The reload mechanism feels dodgy and unreliable.Bugs and performance issues.Annoying attempts at humour.If bullet hell wave shooters is your thing, then this is a recommended purchase, but imo this is a poor man's Space Pirate Trainer.65%"

,Recommended,490490,32167279,Posted: 3 June,all,Baphomet,"Blasters of the Universe is a cute 80s-esque wave room-scale virtual reality shooter featuring a nerd villain who gained ultimate power by stealing a VR system. Each level has campaign and endless modes, the former giving you a boss to fight at the end of the level.One of the neat things about this particular wave shooter is the ability to customize your blaster between games in the armory by changing out various parts that effect damage output, projectile speed, ammo type, and other special effects. I found a semi auto configuration with high damage and medium fire rate to be best, but your experience may vary.Gameplay in BotU is fairly simple, you are confined to your room-space and must dodge incoming projectiles or block them with your shield while returning fire. There is a good variety of enemies to battle with, each having their own special movement, attack style, and projectile. Mixed all together, things can get crazy pretty fast so you’ll have to find ways of prioritizing targets and timing defense to make it through the bullet hell.While not providing much more than score competition once you’ve beaten the campaigns, Blasters of the Universe is still a solid title with quality visuals and catchy music. It’s definitely one of the better wave shooters you can play in VR and worth buying if you’re looking to expand your VR library."

,Recommended,490490,28242908,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,guitaratomik,"This game is really fun! Yes, it is a wave shooter, but it sets itself apart with two main points:1. BULLET HELL APPROACHEnemies (which are pretty varied) shoot a large variety of bullet hell (aka SHMUP) style bullet patterns at you that usually come at you slowly. Since only your head takes damage, this means an enemy might shoot a ring shaped pattern of bullets at you and you’ll be able to dodge it by putting your head directly in the center. Patterns get really crazy and when you have a lot of enemies later in a level, things get hectic. You also get points for dodging that way so there’s a risk reward of stepping out of the way completely, blocking bullets with the shield, or going for the fancy dodge.2. LOADOUT CUSTOMIZATIONIt has a LARGE variety of weapon/defensive customization possibilities. Before you start you basically build your gun out of I think 4 parts with multiple choices for each part. Each one has significant differences which allows for a lot of variety. Want to build a shotgun pistol with explosive ammo that bounces to the next enemy? Sure. How about a fast shooting machine gun with a laser sight and an ammo clip that recharges instead of having to manual reload it? Go for it. The recent update added a bunch of different shields as well which vary from small shields that reflect ammo back, to ones that you can place in the space around you.All that together makes the experience pretty unique. The graphics, art, and presentation are all top notch (though the voice acting lines are a little dumb/annoying). The devs are pretty communicative and update often. Right now I believe it only has an endless mode which is really the only drawback but the gun customization makes it pretty replayable while you try to test out different configurations and a campaign mode is in the works."

This one truly burns calories as you duck and dodge all the bullets coming at you! The game is very difficult and a lot will likely give up on it before even completing the first level.

,Recommended,490490,24455861,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,Mo$es,"READ before you judge it as a bad game, because it isn't!Sorry for my bad english, but i hope u understand the content.PROS:It's a great game when u like arcade shooters.i own about 47 VR games yet, but the gameplay of this game is different compared to others.- The life overview is well made, the enemies look like u expect them in an retro arcade game.- The main menu is designed well and easy to understand. u can try out the weapons u configured.- U have to be active, like dodging, strafing, and so on. it's not a relaxing game where u just sit or stand around and shoot. i like it so far, because that's exactly what i expect from VR (MOVEMENT).- The environment is great, like from an old arcade game, but in 3D.- The bad guy looks similar to old game bosses like crash bandicoot's ""Tropy"", this horns or helmet make him look dangerous but u r not afraid that u cant sleep xD- very lovely designed, keep that style ;)CONS:I really want to give a positive feedback, but not at this stage of development for that price.Graphics, kinematics, and design is not everything. U have to think about the ""feeling"" too.- i cannot realize any feedback when i hit the enemies. it should be more like they flash a bit white on hit and shake a little.- it's nearly too hard to play, at some early point the enemies take over and u r just about to dodge all the time, because the red bullets will block your sight of view and the enemies will countinue spawning. u cant aim when u see nothing than a red screen. u also start to sweat very fast because of it, so i cannot play it as long as it should be expected in future releases when u r exhausted after 15-20 minutes.- u cannot shoot the enemies till they are in their position and they shoot once.- i dont really feel the difference between the damage of the weapons configuration. its like full damage is 100 and lowest is 80. i wanna FEEL the difference, like shooting very slow but full damage will kill instantly. now i feel like hitting the enemy 10 or 8 times times to kill, no matter if the shooting or projectile speed is high or low.- the autoload magazines recharge way too slow, which causes in enemies take over control (like described above).There is also a bug i ran into: The ""heavy"" magazine (the square one, not the spike) wont refill in game when empty.- i dont feel an increase in difficult, it increases too fast to recognize. for example: at the beginning there are 3 enemies, u shoot them, then there spawn 5. u try to shoot them, but in the next moment there are 9 enemies before u can shoot even 3 of the old ones.i think this is also a problem with the angle of view u have in ur HMD. sometimes i got hit from a side i checked a few seconds before. u dont see the enemies coming from the sides from your canthus.SUGGESTIONS:- a small hint about their life status would be great, like a lifebar or something like a color change (green, yellow, and red eyes for example)- the weapons themself (pistol, smg, heavy) have no features at all, its just the size and look they distinguish from each other. i wish they woluld have pros and cons aswell. like more shooting speed but less damage for smg, etc...a secondary function on the right grip button would be great, here a few examples that would make sense:pistol: laser sight instead of this weapon addonsmg: burst shotheavy: homing missile (consumes a large amount of ammo)- i miss some powerups which will last a short time, like no reload, shield, double damage, ... (for 5-10 sec)- there should be a lifebar at the shooting site in the main menu. so u can tell the difference in damage dealt.- when u die ingame, there should be an end-screen instead of directly going back to main menu.SUMMARY:I like the game so far, its well designed, easy to understand, and in real VR so u have to move.The price would be OK if there were bit more features, for now i would suggest € 9,90 is OK.When there are more features, powerups, health status and levels u can pass through, and maybe a story, i would buy it for even €25,- to €30,-."

Final state of affairs review available:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp9QJJ-W41oPrevious comments/more ""complete"" reviews of various mechanics etc below.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Previous Review]Alright, so reviewing this after the new Boss update. Though I've owned it a while.Video review with more depth here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QExzEyNk1kDon't jump out of your seats to buy/play the new Campaign mode. At the moment the boss looks great, but plays very badly. It's repetitive, not balanced well and really becomes a less fun type of endurance. I spent 8 minutes and got the boss down less than a 1/4 of its health. I'm not crazy bad or anything, my Endless scores are currently like top 5 or 8 on the leaderboard. It just needs work. The groundwork is there.Pros:Game is oozing with character. Aesthetic/Sound/Theme are all super strong.Endless mode is fantastic.Gun play is generally good.Enemies are fun to fight.Difficulty curve is spot on, you discover more complex attacks and greater numbers of enemies as you go. It feels very natural, and like every time you learn how to cope it ups the ante.Cons:Campaign mode currently just a worse version of Endless.Could do with some more enemy types, even +1 colour type for each enemy (Walker, Bug, Floating Bald Man) with different attack types/speed attributes would go a long way.Could maybe do with a more explosive feeling game mode, I don't mean literal explosions I mean pacing wise. Sometimes it takes a lot of bullets to kill something, even with the ""max power semi auto pistol"" setup. Maybe just make it a bit more kinetic somehow.Buy it."

It was much better than expected on the video.The gameplay is amazingly perfect! Bullet hell is a very good discription of this game. There's always shots and enemies somewhere and you have time to react to everything going on. I truly feel that it's my own fault for doing something stupid and I get better all the time. All the shots coming at you makes it super immersive. The formations of the shots makes it very interesting how to tacle them. Finding a spot to stand where everything flies around you feels awesome.It's a pretty small game if you think of it only being 2 levels. But that's like saying a fighting game is a very small game as it's only about 2 characters fighting on screen. This is all about gameplay depth and this game has a lot of love put into the perfection of the levels. It has a very good randomized system which makes it feel refreshing to play even if you start the same endless level from the beginning.It's also a very quick and easy game for introducing people to VR. Very immersive and has a cool 80's VR vibe to it. And the new retro wave music is the best of it's kind!I really wish this would become a huge game with lots of content and would happily pay for DLC. Just don't quit working on it! You're doing a fantastic job!

From the opening intro/setup cutscene to all the little touches throughout, easily the best game on VIVE right now. Love the all the updates that were added for the final release too - new enemies, new UI, just overall even tighter, better, more polished. Really makes just about everything else on VIVE look like amateur hour.  Sure it's 'just another wave shooter' but it's the best of the best. Also have to give a major nod toward the writing and voice acting, some of the best, funniest lines are dropped randomly... the homage to the 80's is also top notch, really can't say enough good thing about this game.My only minor complaint is you can't duel wield from the start. I have been duel wielding so long in Space Pirate Trainer that I don't even think about the shield and I don't use it at all. It's just a distraction... you either aggressively dodge (which is a better workout too) or you use a shield like a coward/chump.I'd also humbly suggest an option as a second (left-hand) weapon for a 'laser sword' or 'laser dagger' (aka light-saber like weapon), because enough of the enemies get up close, I find it super annoying I can't slice them down and it would be stellar cool to Luke laser-sword-like parry incoming shots... perhaps in an update... ;)  I'd also prefer a true beam weapon like SPT has, it's instant hit capabilities are hard to beat and quite awesome in duel wield mode.Just super impressed guys, great game, great update, great job in overall!Those are minor issues though, and relaly would just be icing on top of an already supremely excellent cake."

I find the guns to be accurate enough that I don't have to rely on the laser pointer thing. What I do like about is that you can customize the weapon and you do it in a shooting gallery type place so you can whack together the pieces you want and then test it out right there. It makes sense.It has different options for graphics and UI and whatever, so that's nice too.What I like about it is that it has a fair amount of different enemies. The music and sound is nice. I have to say, though, that being taunted by the villain is really entertaining. It does get difficult fairly quickly. Sometimes. There are times when you have a good old time shootin' and dodgin' for quite a while before it gets really hectic. Other times it sort of gets crazy right away (usually when re-trying).The only thing I don't like and, judging by the level screen, it's probably temporary, is that there's only one location. I like divirsity so having different enemies and different locations is always a good thing in my opinion.Like I said, I have a Rift and this works fine. I also have a rather limited play area and I only occasionally knock things over or hit a wall. So if those are your concerns, don't be concerned."

Super fun gameplay that involves dodging and utilizing a ton of unique weapons.  Customizing your load out is a lot of fun and the details put into the equipment is wonderful.  Can’t wait till more levels are unlocked but I will keep playing this one endless mode for now.  Its really hard to describe how great it feels to dodge your head through a spiral of bullets while shooting at an enemy in another direction.

No other VR game has me ducking and dodging this much, and some of the insane bullet patterns definitely make you feel like you're basically playing a bullet hell with your face.  But because it's your face, which typically is attached to your head and neck, you have a huge amount of precision to tightly surf the various patterns of doom.  It's stupidly satisfying.Looking forward to more content, although already with just the one level (and a huge number of weapon configurations) I can see myself coming back to this.  A lot."

,Recommended,490490,24349888,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Flippo,Similar to Space Pirate Trainer but plays way different in my opinion. Bullets only damage your head so you can weave in and out of bullets that don't travel at break neck speed. It becomes diffcult quick if you can't take out the enemies fast enough. The massive amounts of bullets coming towards you will become impossible to weave in and out of without your shield. Overall loads of fun and cheap to boot.
,Recommended,490490,24344618,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,MANTRONIX,"ok. this is important to know for a satisfying experience: unlike in space pirate trainer, ONLY your HEAD is target for the aliens in this game. no hitboxes for your body.  This game is one of my new favorites, no kidding. very playable, very entertaining, great graphics, tight action. but then again i'm just an odb who loves vr games with that touch of oldschool and funky neon-shine. absolutely worth the price, it came the same day raw data was released cause it's just as well done. PERFECT!"

AI is non-exist and shooting doesn't feel satisfying. What's the point of make choices between Damage and Accuracy if there isn't even a sight to aim on?Design wise bullet hell with shield can be fun. Weapon building system grants a bit of replayability.I just don't like the fact that devs are so eager to put their game out even it's no more than a demo. Steam is becoming kickstarter at some point."
,Not Recommended,490490,34708861,Posted: 3 September,all,Tigerhawk71,"Reloading is not very well done due to placement issues (the clip is ""hovering"" out from the gun in one hand and the clip itself is above the other. This caused me no end of frustration when i was busy trying to watch the incoming fire.Enemies can shoot though objects, but you can't. Also a nuisance.As it stands, it's basically just another so-so wave shooter. VR has enough of these already, i feel."

Difficulty is high due to the number of enemies. Repetative gameplay as most wave shooters are. This game has potential, but in its current state I will not reccomendt it. There are much better VR shooters out there."
,Recommended,490490,34159265,Posted: 10 August,all,-DOOMER-,"This shoting galary style VR game has gobs and gobs of personality.  The 80's feel is fun and the art is nice.  There is more customizability than you would think in a simple game like this, but you can really dile in the gear to your play style.  The boss fight was a bit clunky though, and hard to make progress on.  Though I hear the boss fight was to be patched since my last time playing.  All in all, a very fun game."

76561198019909310,Recommended,490490,34496340,Posted: 25 August,all,LFurtado,This game has a great potencial to become one of the best VR arcade wave shooters.
,Not Recommended,490490,24726895,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,undeadpixels,"Can't recommend at $15. Could be a few bucks for the shooting gallery of targets but the rest of the game inflating the price is not worth.I'll ignore all the minor complaints and just point out the core problems.#1 While on the surface there appears to be a large variety of gun parts to mix and match with at the end of the day you have two flavors, chocolate or vanilla with a choice of rainbow sprinkles or nuts.#2 To the same fault of the flavorless guns, the enemies are just as bland. It is all random chaos. You are either holding your shield up non stop to protect yourself from a constant hailstorm of bullets or just waiting for something to happen. There are no patterns or systems to the enemies to make them fun."
76561197968499437,Not Recommended,490490,34818382,Posted: 8 September,all,Buried Egg,"Dammit! I really wanted to like this game. I really tried. But the primitive graphics just doesn't live up to the standards that have currently been set for modern high-end VR. I'm sorry, but developers can't just keep using ""retro"" or ""1980's style"" as an excuse to serve up non-bump-mapped, non-noise-mapped, practically untextured polygons anymore in VR.As for the action/gameplay, I'm not ""anti-wave shooter"" either. Yes, the VR market is currently clogged up with them but things like ""Serious Sam VR"" have found ways to make them fun. This game does *not* live up to the current wave-shooter standards set by games like ""Raw Data"", ""Serious Sam"", or ""Brookhaven"". The AI is non-existent. The entire game is just mindless robots wandering on predetermined paths hurling simple polygons at the user.I'm really sorry to be so negative, devs, but this game was just boring. I do want to say that I appreciate the flair and design in the backgrounds on some levels but it just isn't enough to justify the pricetag. Even if it were free I don't think this could pull me away from the current wave-shooters out there in on SteamVR."

76561197996679866,Recommended,490490,34867723,Posted: 10 September,all,564.3,"TL;DR: I enjoy the game overall, great gameplay and some good ideas. Though there are slightly annoying bits, and the difficulty curve was reversed for me (hard first, then easier and easier).First I didn't like the bad guy and some of the graphical design. I also found the weapons were too toy like and weak. The reloading system was weird to manage.Fortunately, the gameplay was great enough for me to hit my head over and over on the first level.Then I passed it and unlocked some more satisfying weaponry. Was still a bit difficult to find the best match for my play-style, but I also managed to finish the second level after many tries.Third and last levels became almost too easy.Now that I unlocked everything, I plan to continue on improving my scores in the infinite modes, and play the challenges. Great game."
