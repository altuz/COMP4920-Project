Your fly jumps in a square at 4 places to dodge the minutes-/hours pointer of a faster running watch. Each jump brings you 1 scorepoint. Quite innovative and challenging on higher scores because the pointer speed increases. Mostly you can fullfill a 3/4 hour and have to wait for the minutes to open a gap between them and the hours. The game also contains different clock designs, fly costumes, a MP mode and upleveling."

,Recommended,490820,24198221,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,SaltTM,"Very addicting clicker game. The idea of the game is you're a bug and your goal is to not hit the clock arms. The faster you click (though there's a hard click based on the jump animation, once the animation finishes is when your jump triggers so be aware of this gotcha) the faster the clock hands go. You keep going until you unlock all the characters. I believe each character has different characteristics to them, so far the first few seem like they have different jump distances and or jump speeds that you have to get used to. I could be wrong.There's multiplayer so if you think you're the♥♥♥♥♥♥ then go play ranked and face off versus very passive players lol that abuse the slowness of the hands. The trick is to go as slow as possible and let your opponents wipe out.10/10 on addiction7/10 on overall game. Not bad, not amazing, it just is what it is, and the graphics are pretty nice.This is a mobile game in disguise ;)"
,Recommended,490820,28022447,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,BluePaw,"This is one of those games that are fun to play when you're bored or just want something simple yet difficult to play.You hop around on a wrist watch, avoiding both the minute and hour hand, and see how many jumps you can get before you get hit by the hands. Eventually you'll unlock new characters the more you play and how many points you get per game.It's fun, addicting, and you might end up going ""one more attempt!"" five times in a row before you give up. Eventually you'll notice bit of a pattern with the hands based on where they start, and with enough time and patience you can score big.There is local and online multiplayer, however I have zero experience to say anything about it.It's worth a dollar, and might find the other games by the dev team fun that you might buy the bundle instead. It's also best to play this on a low resolution than you're used to, unless you're playing with friends locally and further away from the monitor.\-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish."
76561198019173178,Recommended,490820,26250706,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,SilverAgeFan,"Consider my thumbs up generous for this title. Fly O'Clock is okay for what it is. But it lacks much of the charm of the hit Timberman.When first breaking in the game, note that the early game (anything below 100 jumps) is dreadfully slow. I'm pretty sure that the velocity of the hands is tied directly to your jump count, not the number of revolutions they have made.I got the game in a publisher bundle which was on significant enough sale that I spent maybe $.49 on average. I was more interested in Timberman and Surfingers, both of which in my opinion are superior titles in the hardcore-twitch casual-depth game genre.Much of this game feels half finished and rushed in its design. For example, the achievements simple and boring—awarded at increments of 50 up to 400. The character unlock system is facile at best. And the lack of a volume slider is peculiar.All that being said, as single button games go, this one does have the ability to hypnotize. Game induced altered states are not always enjoyable. But if played with the game volume down and Rachmaninoff in the background, you're sure to have a pleasant trip.As I've said in other reviews, I find myself wishing for a neutral, mixed, or sideways rating. Depending upon my mood, I'd give this title between a 4/10 and 6/10. I wouldn't buy this title on its own or at full price. But if you got it as part of a bundle, as I did, maybe you might find it a worthwhile distraction for a few hours."

,Recommended,490820,29390308,Posted: 20 January,all,qre$,Amazing game! Great graphics for a game re-made from the arcade times. Would like to see some form of communication though like a chat on the bottom right of multiplayer so you and your friends could see what they say. Maybe on the bottom right preferably. Would recommend someone buy this if they played the arcade version and would like to play it again very cheap. The price is amazingly cheap for the graphics / quality.  Worth $2.45 in my mind!

,Recommended,490820,28495822,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,Diemrfly,"This game looks sort of terrible when you check it out at the store, but then I bought it and started playing it to realise that Fly O'Clock is extremely addictive, fun, and hard to master.There's multiplayer mode and single player mode, where you gain XP for leveling up and rank points for beating rivals. Each level up, you unlock a different playable character - and each match you play (single player or multiplayer) the screen, watch, hand, and randomised hat for your character changes, which at times has had me in hysterics.Patience is key if you want to progress in this game. Even when you get one jump further than your best score, it feels like you've just conducted a miracle.8/10Would be brutally murdered by a clock hand again."

,Not Recommended,490820,24250843,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Dovahbilly,"Okay the single player is this game is great, it operates by a points system and it's quite addicting.However, then you get into the meat of the product. The multiplayer. You play to get as many points as possible, but die before the other player. Ah well, you got 30 points and they got 11... Wait, what? They still won? Why?For some reason the multiplayer operates by a survival mechanic instead of a timer formula or some sort of high score formula where if you die the other player continues until they beat yours or die themselves. The points are there for literally no reason and the survivial mechanic just makes zero sense and is honestly pretty unexciting.If the multiplayer was changed, this game would definitely be worth the small amount of cash to buy it.EDIT: This game has been updated but still suffers the problem of a survival based system. It's better, but still not as good as it could be."

All you do is jump over the hands of a watch, trying to get a better score. You can play online or local muiltiplayer. Something I don't get is that online muiltiplayer is splitscreen too, kind of weird. Also, after only playing a couple online games (even losing about half) i was about number 70 in the world. Once you get the hang of it the game gets easier and easier and the online servers are a bit baren but for $1 you can't go wrong, even if you only get an hour or two out of it."

This game is a diamond in the rough in the video game industry, and has enough cutscenes to also boast a full-feature film.  The characters are dynamic, the weather system and day-night cycle is groundbreaking for the industry, and the voice acting is simply incredible.  This game tugged on my heartstrings every time a major character died, and had me asking for more.  This game made usthinkand the story made usfeel.  The ranking system is as rewarding as it is ambient, and the online community is still discovering easter eggs within this masterpiece.Alright, down to the scoring.Music:10/10. Not even Hans Zimmer could compose a theme as emotional as Fly O'Clock's.Gameplay:11/10. Never had I ever been as immersed in a video game as this one.  I was sucked into this complex dynamic world and could not get out.  I fell in love with the characters, and the gameplay itself is completely seamless.Graphics:perfect 5/7. I honestly could not distinguish this game from real life.  If you enjoyed the graphics of modded Battlefront 3, you will be blown away by the textures and animations.Controls:∞/10.  If you play this game with a HTC Vive, you will struggle to distinguish your real-life motorary functions from your actions within the game.  The controls are intuitive, responsive, and dynamic.Final Verdict:If you do not own this game, you are missing out on an experience that will shape your life decisions for years to come.
