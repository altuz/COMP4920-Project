,Recommended,491000,24413539,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,Tired Tigress,"NOTE: My previous review was not a recommendation, but I have decided to change it to a recommendation.While it may not be the best or most original game out there, the price is right for what you get. The invert gravity button still likes to not register sometimes, but I am no longer 100% sure it is the game's fault. While I have seen others facing the same problem, I have had friends play the game and tell me that they have not experienced it.The main reason why I have decided to change my mind is that I have observed just how active the dev is in interacting with the players and how quick he is in fixing things. He's going above and beyond to make sure everyone is happy, and that alone deserves praise.If you're a fan of these kinds of hard platformers, pick it up."
76561198080837717,Not Recommended,491000,31829275,Posted: 18 May,all,Dusteon,"Gravity Cat is a platforming game with a few simple mechanics that are used very well, marred by poor level design, sluggish controls on the main mechanic, and a very large dose of artificial difficulty.Pros: CheapHas 70 levels.Overall cute game.Core gameplay has a lot of potential and is fun.Cons: Hitboxes seem very wonky and you'll often die while wondering how something hit you.Gravity switching arbitrarily fails sometimes if done while moving. If near a ledge it fails even more often. This makes most of the levels extremely frustrating; most of my deaths were from shoddy gravity controls.Extreme fake difficulty. A lot of the levels are ""go back and forth over this spiked buzzsaws 20 times"". One of the later levels is the worst example of this I have ever seen: it's a minute or so straight of going right over buzzsaws following the same pattern, then a minute or so going left over the same pattern again. The difficulty isn't from the saws (which are on an easy pattern) but from fatigue from doing it for that long.Extra points for later levels where the map is larger, but withno way to scroll up to see any hazards. All of the final levels ♥♥♥♥ up this way so extremely I cannot recommend the game. It's incredibly frustrating to die not because you mistimed a jump or used gravity too early, but because the map outright hides the platforms and spikes off screen and you have to hope you don't land on a spike.Overall it's a cheap game and some of the earlier levels are fun, but it quickly becomes a painful slog. The secondary mode doesn't even help with that, as using it removes the ability to jump and makes most of the gameplay into ""hit gravity multiple times and hope it doesn't stop you inside a spike""."
,Recommended,491000,24400980,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,Alan Redgown ♥,"It's not often you find a dev courageous enough to make a game about flipping gravity whose biggest flaw is inconsistent success when flipping at edges of platforms, and then put a level in that game that tells the player ""Go on, get right up to the edge, you'll need it to make that flip-jump! I have faith in you!""It wasn't *your* confidence in *me* I was worried about, game.Other than that, it's a bit of fun. About what you'd expect. I beat it in 88 minutes, but I grew up on platformers...and apparently there are more levels coming in August 2016, so those should extend the gameplay significantly.(srsly though, if I'm in a state of standing on the ground, I should really always be able to flip, even if I'm right on the edge, grumble grumble)"

I am experiencing a problem in infinite inverted where if I die, it switches back to standard mode until I quit or complete the level.  Also, I'm not sure if you're supposed to be able to jump infinitely in infinite inverted mode, but you can. Aside from the minor bugs, the game is outstanding. Well worth the price."

""Linea"" was impossbile,but this game is very playable.A nice little simple platformer game that is resonably difficult.  The concept is straightforward. You are cat who can defy gravity at will and most pass through many maze/platform like levels with switches, lasers, and saws.  Lasers and saws will kill your feline self. Switches turn the lasers off, but the switches are hard to get to.My one complaint is there is not much variety in the obstacles the cat faces.  Basically just a series of lasers and saws.  However, the game is still a nice diversion for a while and different from the normal games I play."

No blood and is good for little kids! Nothing bad.May not be as much for people my age for good for kids.It's good if you like games with no strong violence and no bad language!

You get no options to change the keys. Although that can be expected of a small game. Another problem is that the game is very often unresponsive when using the keys which pretty much ruins the whole game for me since its based around movement challenges completely. Therefore I cannot recommend the game at this moment.
