76561198006276098,Recommended,491040,24779808,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,Samurai Cop,"Very fun and challenging arcade style, fast paced shooter, presented in a 90's SNES visual style.  Bot Vice contains about 25 stages. Each level plays out on a single screen where you battle waves of robots until you reach the mini-boss battle at the end. Eventually leading up to the main story boss battles that progress the story line of the game. Some of the more hilarious bosses include parodies of Bebop and Rocksteady, as a bit of a TMNT fan tribute. The game also now features easy and hard mode. With the main difference being you receive health item drops while playing on easy difficulty.The game can be a bit tough at times but with a bit of practice it's possible to overcome. You're not only trying to just complete each stage but also race to obtain the best time possible. In order to stop the plot you're only given a set amount of time to complete the game. It becomes fairly important to keep your level completion times as low as possible.The voice acting and long winded villain speeches add a bit of charm, as a loving reference to all the awesome and silly arcade sounds of old. The music is not bad and it contains some decent sound effects and a few silly voice lines. Music wise nothing incredible. It works well for what it's meant to be at least.The controls are very responsive, although the lock on system can be a little tricky at times. The power ups can also be a little tricky to cycle through.Theoretically the game is fairly short. But it still took me about 3-4 hours of actual playtime on easy mode to finally complete the game. It also gives you alot of achievements to shoot for which adds some replay-ability. I would say you're probably looking at 3-6 hours of playtime if you're as bad as I am at shooters, plus maybe another 1-2 hours if you're going for all the achievements.To sum it up, I really enjoyed playing this game and felt a real sense of accomplishment and excitement after finally kicking the final boss in his♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you're looking for some classic arcade action that offers a good challenge at a fairly cheap price I'd highly recommend giving Bot Vice a try."
,Recommended,491040,30582175,Posted: 17 March,all,WanderingMind,"The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it.  Make no mistake, this is old school gaming at its core.  Meaning no mercy.  You learn through your many mistakes.  And somehow you get better.  You finally beat the game.  But you look back and think you can do better.  So you play it again, hoping to get even better.For the love of god, use a controller.  Friends don't let friends use keyboard for this game.  That being said, the controls take some time getting used to.  You will probably be spending a good amount of time stumbling with the controls before it feels right, however long it takes.  Targetting will always feel somewhat off, but somehow, like everything else in the game, it somehow works out.I strongly recommend starting on Easy.  Even then the game can be very challenging and may take you some time to get through all the levels.  If you are feeling adventerous, you could always start on Normal.  But you are going to rely on the health pickups a lot.  Maybe you want to do the extra stuff later.  And maybe you can take on Hard mode when you get get skilled enough.That being said, I have been enjoying this game a ton.  It feels nice to be able to jump into a game without any handholding so I can shoot a lot of things and blow them up.  Taking on waves of enemies is always a thrill, and the boss fights really make you work hard to win.  It's the sort of hardcore gaming fix I needed.  Enough for me to start speedrunning it.As a speedrun, this game has been downright amazing.  Being forced to play against the clock and learning to be efficient with your weapons makes this game so great to play at a high skill level.  Even not speedrunning it, just getting good at the game feels rewarding.Have I mentioned how much I love the soundtrack for this game?  These tracks are so freaken good.  Also I'm digging the visual style for this game.  The story and dialogue are forgettable, but I didn't really pay much attention to either.  I was too busy dodge rolling and shooting.I'm glad I came across this game on Steam and would recommend playing it."

It looks and feels great and the difficulty is just right. It adds a lot of replay value with the grading and time systems. Even if you do really well on a stage you can always try to beat your time.I waited for this to go on sale because I thought it may be short or lacking in dynamics. I was very wrong. Tons of obstructions, enemies/bullet patterns. I would definitely buy it for full price if I had to."
,Recommended,491040,24268837,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,William Shakesman,"When the entire store description of a game is devoted to how hardcore it is and how you must learn the systems to play their game... you kinda know what you're in for.After an intro so incredibly cringey*, you might mistake yourself for having bought a Gearbox game by mistake, you are thrust fairly quickly into battle. The best way to describe this is Wild Guns, only lightning quick and with very little margin for error. The game is divided into a series of short 1-2 minute chapters that are all wild gun fights culminating in midboss battles. You take cover, dodge roll, lock on, blast, and generally redo each level over and over again until you perfect your execution enough to beat it.So in that sense it is far closer to an modern indie game than any of the classics they describe. Infinite tries on a short crazy hard level.For all their talk of tight mechanics, they certainly deliver. Your awkward lock-on works incredibly well in the context of the game, and in just the early levels, they throw in tricky situations of obstacles you DON'T want to shoot as well as situations where it's better to not lock on or to keep locked on to the ""wrong"" enemy to put fire in the direction you want. You very quickly feel like a bullet artist, and you absolutely must to clock a good time on these stages.The only weak part, aside from the truly cringe-tastic writing, is that weapon switching is unwieldy. You only get one button to iterate one way through your extra weapons and in a game that is incredibly quick, and where you have about seven extra weapons to iterate through, and where you have to take your eyes off the screen to see what you are selecting and what you have ammo for.... For a game that is so mechanically precise in every other measure, to give you such little control over your extra weapon pickups just feels like you're supposed to mash ""switch and shoot"" at specific waves to just empty your special weapons at tougher parts of the fight, but since flamer and grenade weapons have unique arcs and purposes, that's simply not the case.Make no mistake. This game is tough. It does a wonderful job of crafting its own niche, taking from the classics the tight shooting action and taking from modern indies the ""repeat until perfect"" style level design. As much as their store blurb sounds like they're tooting their own horn, the developers of this game really earn every bit of it. This is some strong game design. It is definitely worth a look if you are not sick to death of the indie infinite lives hard levels style yet.*The people griping about the voice actors are morons. The writing is the culprit here. The voice actors do a damn fine job with the material they got."

It offers 25 stages with boss battles every 5 stages or so.It's really good but hard. I needed to play on easy mode to even get a chance, Now that I'm more familiar with the controls, I'll give it another go on normal.The main downside is the voice acting. It's not horrible, I quite liked the voice actress of the main character but I think the game would've been better without it. The story is also nothing to write home about. It's kindof self-aware. I think the game maybe would've been better with a simpler, shorter story?Some more feedback for the developers:- Adding an easy mode was a good idea. I know it doesn't exactly fit with your vision, but some people like to enjoy the game at their own pace. If you didn't add one, I probably would've cheated to get the experience I want.- Add a way to reset controller options to default- Maybe add cosmetic stuff like unlockable costumes for the main character after completing the game- Yay, post credits scenes are awesome.- I really didn't like the voice of Dr. Octipus- I'm not sure if I entirely like the way weapon cycling works. Not sure how I'd change it. Maybe automatically change to a new weapon on pickup? Maybe only go back to your pea shooter after you exhausted all options? Shortcuts for every weapon? The way I used the weapons now is just go through them one for one, till they run out.Looking forward to your next game!"

It seems so deceptively simple:  you move right and left, you shoot, you roll (with temporary invulnerability), you duck behind destructible cover.  You've probably done it before.  It seems simple, but take warning:  this game will completely own your sweating hams if you don't have your fly-catching lizard brain up and running, and that's all on you, buddy!

And then yesterday i did, rushing through the stages like i was on fire and cleared the last battle with a sore thumb and a smile of satisfaction in my face.It's been a while since a game made me feel like this, victorious.Yup, this game's good, it's hard, but good.You will probably die a few times and then by sheer willpower you will learn how to actually protect yourself in the stages, manage your special weapons and memorize all the enemy behaviour.Cause the game is all about that : shooting, slashing, and not getting hit.So once you learn how to do it, the time limit will become meaningless.The graphics are endearing, the gameplay is filled with nonstop action, the controls are pretty responsive and the music is awesome (They actually need to start selling it here on Steam) and i didn't mind the writing so much. This piece of digital art actually brought me back memories of  hooking up my SNES to play Wild Guns all the afternoon, Good Times.I highly recommend that you buy this game and play it until you get good at it, it's hard yes but it's one of the few hard games that actually left me wanting for more.PS: The Final boss is really bothersome specially because you can't heal, try to finish his first form quickly before he destroys all the cover you get, you'll need that cover to survive his second form."

You can skip the filler, though.I had fun with this game, and I intend to play more of it now and again, but it's not as jump-in as I was expecting - everything in between drags on and is too cheesy to even smirk at. The tutorial is slow (play Bleed and you'll know how you go into an action game fast) and the cutscenes even slower, and when I once tried to just hurry the dialogue along, the cutscene simply skipped. Fast-paced action doesn't complement dragging cutscenes with unimaginative writing.It's the game part that you really get this for, it's fast and it's simple in an arcade fashion like you'd expect. Although the constant barrage of bullets and flashes make some tells like the final boss' lasers hard to notice and the time limit gimmick most likely will infuriate someone who plays more carefully, I personally had fun just playing this. Though under 2 hours, it's an indie game so I'll accept that, but the base price makes it definitely a sale item for me.Just don't bother with the cutscenes, you might strain your eyes rolling them so hard."

It's of fun but hard even on the easy setting.It took me half an hour to finish the first stage on verry easy - year I suck.You can tell the developer put little effort into the PC controll mapping. The PC controlls are just a game pad controlls re-map. It would have been nive if you didn't have to cycle through weapons and could just use hot keys. Considering adding keyboard buttons in the GML engine is♥♥♥♥♥♥easy I don't know why it wasn't added for the PC version.Up as hid behind cover and down as roll is also counter intuitive. I sugest switching the two. Luckly the game dose alow you to rebind keys - although you have to rebind all the keys every time - even if you only want to change one controll.All up a fun game that is old school NES hard. The controlls are a bit cluncky but it's a fun pick up and play game.

Deceptive how well the controls mesh well with the hectic nature of the gameplay... once you've patiently accustomed yourself to them, that is. (I recommend switching the bumper controls to the triggers for those of you with 360 controllers.)A solid gallery shooter that echoes the great Capcom aesthetic of the SNES days. And as I've said before, the writing and voice acting are such a dicotomy in quality to the gameplay itself that they actually become oddly endearing, haha. Like a surprising B-movie: great after a couple of beers.Worth your money."

What this shooter provides is a sense of raw, exhilarating action that many modern games have forgotten about. DYA Games was not kidding: this game truly is pure gameplay and no filler, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Bot Vice is tough. VERY tough. But it always makes you want to come back for more, trying again and again until you finally complete a stage after the twentieth attempt.  Combine this with fantastic pixel art and Dominic Ninmark's truly phenomenal soundtrack, and I can easily say, with no exaggeration, that Bot Vice is my favorite game of 2016. It may seem intimidating, but if you are not one to shy away from a challenge, then you absolutely owe it to yourself to play Bot Vice. I simply cannot recommend it enough."

The game feels, sounds and looks great.The game can seem simple, but there are a lot of mechanics and the devs knew how to use them smartly. I found the normal difficulty to be just fine, with a few levels (especially the last boss) requiring ""a few"" retries. In the time it took me to finish the main story (~2 hours), even during those harder levels, I never felt like a death was the game's fault.The game makes you want to try hard mode and all stages with all hearts (plus, there are extra missions!). This might be too much for me, but I'll try just because this game's fun to play, no doubt about that.Also from what I've seen devs are awesome so I can't recommend supporting them enough."

I have a particular fondness for games that try to capture that old simplistic nature of earlier SNES titles and few reach the level seen here. It can get chaotic at times but the gameplay is always satisfying enough to push away frustration.Certainly turned out to be a much more fun experence than I expected for something I bought on a whim.
76561198055230426,Recommended,491040,35193093,Posted: 24 September,all,Quagon McFlagon,"i dont typically write reviews for games, but whenever I see game made by basically one person that is this fun, I gotta give em props. I am a sucker for old school games, But I hate people who think nostalgia alone is enough to act as a hook. That is not the case with Bot vice. The game does a good job of making fun of old school games and the corny stories that they follow, while also making the game adicting and fun! If you make a light parody/homage type game, this is the way to do it.Next off lets talk about the game play. This game does a great job of establishing all of the controls and power ups from the very beginning as well as the maneuvers. The controls are simple and tight and the game plays like a cross between Sin and Punishment, and  Wild Guns (not a bad combination at all!). My only real gripe is that I wish that there were more guns ! I don't need like 20+ but maybe 3-4 more would do it for me.Moving on I will cover  the games look and design. I love the variety of bot designs and bosses, They are nicely animated and have a vibrant appeal to them. The baddies also have an array of attack styles that make you have to adapt accordingly, usually by waiting for an opening (Snake bot I'm looking at you!) The satges also are beautifuly designed! each of the stages look unique and have interesting gimicks that can add to the mayhem, such as trains ramming through the stages, armored trucks launching bombs every where.or even Robot trash bugs chasing  you out of trash cans!My final talking point is music. I love video game music and music and general so For me a games soundtrack appeal is crucial to my desire to want to play a game. I believe that A games soundtrack should enhchance and support the overall game. This game nails it! I love the Megaman and TMNT esque soundtrack that this game delivers! the 80's and 90's synth fit the homage style and each stage has it;s own theme! No reused songs except for the bosses at the end of the main levels, but each boss specific stage has their own high octane but kickin background theme! I only wish that the Music was dlc :DMy only real gripes are that I wish there was more guns , that there were a co op, and that the game innovated a little buit more in establishing its own Identity. but judging by the ending, I am sure we will see more from the creators one day! and I look forward to it! Get this game if you like frantic high octane shootouts and a cast of corny quote spewing enemies with laughable voices!  For a Arcade game 8/10Also when you beat the game be sure to check out the extras, because the fun truly begins there ;)"

New enemies have been introduced on every level so far, and they all come with an attack or ability that you have to adapt to while still fighting off the horde of robot variations you're used to.

,Recommended,491040,33447656,Posted: 10 July,all,drunkendan,I really enjoyed this game. The frantic style of the game reminds me a bit of Wild Guns though that is not comepletly accurate. Unlike Wild Guns you have a melee attack (that can also stop some projectiles) a dodge roll and a cover system.Enemies come at you relentlessly but the game isn't unfair and slowly introduces new enemy types throughout the levels. You WILL die in this game (even on Normal mode) but that is ok. You have 30 ingame minutes to beat all the stages or you will get a game over. It isn't impossible to do your first run. I managed to do it on my first normal mode run. I recommend playing either on normal or easy on your first run of the game.The presentation is pretty damn good! Some of the voice acting can be a little hit or miss but it is pretty good. Erin's actress is pretty good though some of her lines were a bit flat. The final bosses voice made me laugh (I think that was on purpose)I would love to see a sequel that expands on this or a DLC update. I recommend this game if your looking for a frantic arcade shooter.last unrelated thing I do not like how the developer asked some reviewers to take their reviews down. They were bad reviews in my opinion but it is not right to do this. In the future please do not do this. It almost scared me away from buy this game. It just looks bad.

Only real gripes are that some of the achievements can be annoying to get due to the enemies behaving randomly (""Clear level without destroying this part of the stage""... the enemies then wander around endlessly behind that part of the level) and that the voice acting can be pretty bad. Some of the characters sound like they belong in a Playstation 1 era game where the translator brought in family members to handle the dub.But the game is fast paced, the visual are bright and colorful without ever getting garrish and the soundtrack has some great pieces to it.

,Recommended,491040,31362119,Posted: 25 April,all,CobaltBW,"Bot Vice hits all the right 90's arcade vibes. The gameplay is fast-paced, varied and strategic, with a 25-level campaign as well as a ton of side missions for replayability. So far I've played through about 30 stages and all of them have been fun -- there have been a few levels that made me grind my teeth, but they're difficult in all the right ways. Difficulty levels are togglable, which makes it easier to get into while still allowing experts to challenge themselves. What might make things a little difficult for new players is the complex control scheme, which does have a bit of a learning curve to properly utilize. Once you do understand it, the game's a blast. I'd recommend going into the options menu and customizing your controls to find out what layout works for you.My only complaint about the game is that the cutscenes are long, boring as hell, and have cringeworthy acting. Most of them are skippable, but ending cutscenes unfortunately are not. On the flipside, the spritework and music are both fantastic.I bought this while it was on sale, but if it was full price I would still recommend it."

It took me almost an hour just to beat the first stage alone. When it comes to games similar to Bot Vice, this is the closest game we have to Wild Guns on the PC as of today with a cover system and auto aim instead of manual aim because of the enemy bullets traveling as fast as your bullets instead of the usual travel speed of most bullet hell shooters which is fairly slow to say the least. Honestly the voice acting so far gives me a ""take it or leave it"" vibe since I find it pretty cheesy in my opinion.As far as I can tell, you cannot rebind the keyboard controls and instead gives you 2 presets for you, but they constantly push the notion that the game is best played with a controller not only on the store page, but also the splash screen saying "" Winners don't use keyboards"". Despite the recommended control schemes, it's playable with a keyboard. Enemies are greatly varied and all have distinct attack patterns that are easily identifiable from one another. I would say the only negative thing I can say about Bot Vice is that the difficulty curve is extremely high meaning if you don't have the patience to get better, the difficulty will turn you off completely.Bot Vice is geared towards the masochistic and for anyone looking for a Wild Guns game on the PC, but mainly the masochistic all for the low price of $10."

It's fast-paced and high difficulty call for cat-like reflexes and memorization of enemy placements/patterns. It feels rewarding when you fininsh each level.Feels very 90's-ish arcade or PS1.

However, the game feels clunky in a sense that I cannot explain. It's awkward to say if either the way the controls are set are awkward or how I can only lock onto targets or just shoot infront of me is setting me back, but the game is good and is a love letter to those games of old where you'd feed your weeks allowance just to beat that ONE level. And seeing how short Bot Vice is in a sense the levels sort of HAVE to be hard so you can feel as if you'd just climbed a mountain. Not a bad thing to have if you ask me but personally it's not my cup of tea. As stated above the game does feel somewhat awkward and more then enough all the same allures me in to try and beat it. However I've only beaten the first level and after that it was a mix of not wanting to play and relief that I at least beat A level. If you like games that'll grab you by the collar and make it known this is hard, then by all means dive right in. However just prepare to rage quit a few times in the progress. This game is easier but by no means is it easy."

The artwork is great, the music is wonderful and the controls function very well for this style of game. It is relatively short but high on replay value. There are additional levels and challenges that will also pad out the gameplay if you wish to do them. My only 2 gripes are that there is a lack of co op and I personally would have liked to have had an additional weapon switch button so I could go from left to right instead of the default right to left, but this is just a personal issue and does not detract from the gameplay. I highly recommend checking this game out if you want some fast and frantic action."

It's that good.Other reviewers are saying this game is extremely difficult.  It is, but you need to know that it's a very fair kind of difficulty.  Deaths aren't cheap, and this game isn't frustrating.  It's one of those games where you will die over and over but be very eager to hop back in and try again because it's so damned fun.The game is divided into many short levels which you can retry as many times as you like, so the consequences for failure are minimal.  Don't be intimidated by this game, the more you play it, the better at it you will get.  When you master the roll-dodge and cover mechanics and learn how to read enemy patterns, you'll be on your way to victory.What Bot Vice has over most other shooters is an absolutely insane level of gameplay diversity.  I gotta give props to the incredible work ethic of these devs, this game is jam packed with different enemy types that have their own unique personality and attack patterns.

The game takes around 2 hours to complete the main story, with another ~2 hours in extra missions. (guessing as I have not completed them all yet.) Instead of going for a dual joystick shooter style, the game is designed with a Super Nintendo controller in mind. This means that instead of using the right stick to aim there is a nearest enemy lock button. It takes a second to get used too, but it works and I really felt like I was playing a high quality snes shooter. This game was more challenging than your average game, but definitely doable. The first stage ends up being the hardest because of the learning curve. It is kind of a bummer though, they are SO close to making a game that looks and feels exactly like it was on the SNES so I don't know why they went and did things outside of the SNES capabilities. Remove voices, keep it to muffled quips, tighten up the writing and you could sell the game as a SNES throwback that is super legit. Heck even the file size is only 160 MB, and I bet it would be a ton less if they removed voices. The game is so close to perfect (for what it is), so it is a bummer they did not bring it the rest of the way. Still, what is there is very good and nothing ruins the experience.The voices are alright. The one in the trailer is the worst of them which makes it a strange choice.Also, I think the cover art for the store page might be hurting their sales. It just doesn't evoke anything to me. I would have looked at this game earlier had I known it was pretty much a sweet snes or old school arcade game."

It's a trial by fire, and you're going to die. A lot.I feel the developer could have done a better job at easing people in by providing a couple of slower/easier stages until players get the hang of the game's controls and mechanics. We didn't get to play the game as much as you did, so please cut us some slack, alright?If you're more into slow-paced, casual experiences, I don't think this game is for you.It's fast, relentless, and it'll probably put you off within minutes.Regardless of my criticism, the game does not deserve a negative mark just for that.It certainly has its audience, and the rest of us will just have to ""git gud"".Whether or not people will put up with it is a different story though."

The second level of the game introduces: an enemy that can hit you in cover, a vehicle that gives enemies in it much more life and acts as a barrier after it's destroyed, and an enemy that catches you off gaurd and quickly fires at you when dashing onto screen. This is too much to handle on only level two (about 5-10 minutes into the game).I do recommend the game because it still feels very good to play, and if you die, it's because you aren't good enough. But, even with easy mode, the game expects the player to know all of nuances in the controls and be able to handle several new enemy types at once."

It's one of those games where I wish it was my idea as its gameplay philosophy resonates with me. You'll love it if you're a huge fan of Wild Guns, Time Crisis, pixels, arcade style gameplay, simplicity with complexity, and awesome synth-rock 90's inspired soundtracks. I don't even mind dying as the music is catchy. I personally love the fact that this game treats me like I've been playing video games for the past 25+ years and is incredibly difficult right off the bat. It's super rewarding when you've got a good flow going using ALL of your abilities and your reflexes are on point. Mashing handgun, dodge rolling, constantly switching weapons depending on the scenario/strategy, blocking bullets with my sword, and carefully timing enemy patterns at a super fast pace. Mentally exhausting, but very fun. This game is one of a kind and I commend the developers for sticking to their game design philosophy instead of catering to the majority. I understand exactly what these developers were aiming for and it clicks with me. Some might complain about the controls. They are certainly different and have a learning curve, but they are excellent. It will take some time to get used to them, but you'll realize you only have yourself to blame when you lose. Sometimes it can add to a game by making the controls something to master. There's a big difference between ""bad controls"" and great controls that just have a learning curve like Bot Vice. Therefore, I'd disregard any complaints about controls. I wish this game received more attention, but its difficulty might only reach a very niche market.

If it doesn't, well it's just alot more of that in the game.I found this game from following the composer (Dom Ninmark) and from the trailer knew right away I was gonna get this.

Play Easy mode if you need health packs, otherwise git gud!Story/Voice/Cutscenes are nothing to write home about. I believe they are intentionally cringey/cheesy, the cutscenes however, are veeeery long and drawn out, but are skippable and can be viewed again anytime.Protip:You can hold duck after a roll to remain invulnerable to shots.Protip:Sometimes it helps to clear obstacles before killing enemies (new ones spawn only when a certain number are killed) HOWEVER, you need to beat the levels within a certain time limit to unlock the higher 20's so do so wisely. I got to level 25 but couldn't start because I was 26 seconds behind so I had to go redo a level faster.Warning:You can die in the tutorial and it will restart, can waste alot of timePro:Levels restart seamlessly when you die and music doesn't stopPro:The musiccccccccccRandom:Some boss levels are easier than levels themselves :)Trivia:Lots of references to old school stuff like Power Rangers, TMNT, Terminator, etc in the dialogues.Finally, devs have really been listening to feedback and quick to patch to keep everyone happy ♥"

,Not Recommended,491040,25627726,"Posted: 21 September, 2016",all,wolfsbane,THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON GAMEPLAY ON NORMAL DIFFICULTYGameplay is tight but the difficulty is completely unreasonable. I play some of the most difficult games and consider myself above average jumping into any game but I had a hard time getting through the first stage with more than a terrible rank. This game is completely unforgiving and if you make a mistake early on you may as well hit retry because you will likely need every heart you have. If you want a reasonable challenge look elsewhere.It is possible to improve and achieve decent ranks but that requires time. Time wherein you frustrate yourself and attempt to overcome failure after failure.
