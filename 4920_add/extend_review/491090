Instead there are missions that go through the development of a colony at a relaxed pace.Even as a relaxed game, the decision points felt too few to be entertaining. Player interaction includes selecting forage spots, initiating an egg and targetting threats. In between these interactions are long stretches of waiting. Players do not direct the building of the nest or make strategic decisions. The long delays between simple decisions made for a boring game."

You have workers, diggers, and nurces, but no soilders. Not very open world game either. It also appears that you cant dig as to where you desire, you automatically dig into one or 2 general directions. Why do I have to go through all these little missions, if all I want to do is build a colony. Game is good, however it needs aloooooot more in my opinion. So you might want to keep it for early access. Until I see even one such improvements, Im afraid I cant recomend this game."

Ants become lost from ground to surface getting stuck in one place or another while enemy travels freely picking you off one at time time. More ants you have sooner you see this.So my review as of now is its a bad port that has been rushed.

I got this because I remember having so much fun playing SimAnt back in 1991 on PC. Sadly, SimAnt as far as open gameplay is still far superior than this game. This game needs an open sandbox mode, with ability to dig tunnels to expand the colony, soldier ants, and rival colonies that have to be handled. There is so much potential here!"

I understand that this is only Singleplayer but adding Nuptial Flights and automatically allying your alates' colony is the best way to dominate, and the enemy ant colonie(s) should have alates too..Now, this may be a frustrating and rage-inducing feature to add, but maybe after 10 minutes, 1-5 Nurser Ants die, after 15 minutes, Worker Ants die, after 25 minutes, the diggers die, then after 30-45 minutes, the Soldiers die and after 1-3 hours, the Super Soldiers die. This will make it a bit more realistic and potentially better than EOTU.I'm excited when Multiplayer comes out, oh boy imagine if you could fight other players' ant colonies!! I wonder when that will come out.Overall, Ant Queen is a great game and for $9.99 USD? Definitley worth it. Thumbs up for this game :D"

Ant Queen is a fun game to play with nice graphics but is definately plagued with bugs and imbalances.  The first bad experience came when the game was released and I was enticed to download the beta version for advanced features and testing.  This was great until the next update where the Dev had decided simply disregard the beta version and update the main game with no announcement to players.  This led me to wonder what the Dev was thinking, so I disregarded the beta version and played the main.  The game consists of two modes being that of story mode and sandbox mode.Story mode is simply a disaster as certain levels, such as seven, were severely bugged with over powering enemies and lack of food.  I have yet to continue past this level, as I had lost interest pursuing it until further patches.Sandbox mode is easy but doesn't really accomplish much.  When writing to the Dev about adding different levels of difficulty, the devs were prompt to add 3 levels. Not really sure as to what the difference in levels are as winning with the hard mode is a breeze.  I suggested to the Dev that (enemy)red ants should take food back to their nest and the Dev was prompt to apply it.The environment is buggy as ants doe get stuck on the corners of rocks or in confined spaces.  The overlay of rocks and bush can sometimes overlap.  Food deposits may sometimes be unaccessible to ants due to clipping conflicts.  The minimap does not show the whole environment, slow to update real-time, and simply confusing.  The game tends to max out at about 100 ants but I could manage quite well with 50.I would have hoped that the Dev would have put more thought and project planning into the game, rather than relying mainly on feedback from  players.  The development just seems confued!!  At this stage with many other better devepoed alpha games out there for the same price, I'm sorry not to recommend it.By the way after the this review waas posted the dev has had me banned from all discussions as a troll.  It seems he cannot take the harsh criticism!"

There are different ant castes, stages of developement, a reasonably good 'pheremone trail' system, but beyond that it gets old real quick.  Story mode is annoying (meant to teach you how to play the game, like a tutorial) in that most lessons are overly drawn out, and tedious, not fun.  I quit seven lessons in and switched to Endless Mode, where I found I didn't need the Story Mode beyond about lesson five.  In Endless Mode you play against one other colony that is very easy to beat on all difficulties.  It's fun while it lasts, but it doesn't last nearly long enough.They would improve the game a lot, I think, if they made the Story Mode lessons shorter, and if they added the ability to fight against more than just one other colony.  Maybe throw in a Creative Mode, where you can just experiment with spawning in other bugs, and enemy ants, or a War Mode, where the other colony actually, you know, survives, and developes, and hey, maybe even puts up a good attempt at 'war'."

You folks get major respect in my book for that.  I bought the game and it's fun and well built.

,Not Recommended,491090,23639196,"Posted: 18 June, 2016",all,Snapchat Hot Dog Dude,"When I first saw this game on Steam I thought it would be something like the old school Ant War game I used to play as a kid, so I decided to give it a try. I completed the game about halfway and was very disappointed with it.The game consists of about 15 scripted missions for you to complete. There is no sandbox mode. As you complete missions, more and more units get unlocked for you to breed. Units have different roles that they take on to help you run your colony. Nurser ants feed the Ant Queen and help the larvae develop into ants. Worker ants collect food from outside the colony and bring it back. Digger ants dig new tunnels and chambers in your colony and deposit the dirt outside. Soldier ants fight against other insects and protect your colony. There is also the Queen Ant, who produces larvae. Her health bar drains every time she produces a larave and every few seconds depending on how many ants are in your colony. The health bar can regenerate by eating food. Each above mentioned unit (besides the Queen) has several different versions, which have more specialized stats.The missions themselves are very straightforward. Some will require you to collect enough food, some will require you to survive against insect invasions for a set time limit, and some will require you to expand your colony by digging new tunnels (which are predeterminated, you do not get to pick and choose how to build your colony.)Units are not directly controlled. Instead, you either turn on or turn off specific tasks for your workers to complete. These tasks include collecting food, developing larvae, digging tunnels, patrolling above ground, or fighting enemies. The AI seems to spend most of its time blindly walking around instead of actually completing these tasks however. Digger ants especially are useless for half the game, as there is no digging for them to do other than in specific missions. This means they drain your Queen's health without contributing anything to the well-being of the colony.This game is simply awful, and asking for $17.99 for it is a joke. There were no reviews when I bought game so I took a chance on it. I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did. Spend the $2.99 for Ant War: Domination instead if you want something significantly better."

The world of ants is sufficiently gritty and subject to sufficient questions of tactics, strategy and logisitics that you could certainly make a pretty good game out of it - the concept is juicy enough that I almost invariably buy every one of these games that I see - everything from Sim Ant on up.I bought this game. I really have buyers remorse.It's hard for me to write a detailed report on what's wrong with the game - but the short version is 'everything you thought might be wrong with it when you decided to check out some reviews before you purchased it yourself.' The graphics are so simple as to be childish, but set in a realistic design that prevents them from being cute. Colony management mechanics are not hard-edged enough to make you feel in control, instead you make vague decisions that conflate with other vague factors to lead to a vague sort of direction towards either success or failure.Increasingly, however, you'll be confronted with a definite sense that the game is simply not good enough. The design of the gameplay mechanics wasn't good enough, the graphics aren't good enough, the sound is equally lack lustre - and so it goes.I wandered off in vague disquiet roughly 20 minutes into my first play and now find myself wishing I wandered back and made the hard call on this game sooner. A week ago, I might have had a pretty decent chance of getting a refund - now, I'm not so sure.I'm still going to try."

While it has the potential to be a great game.. the Bugs that Jam the Ants at the nest entrance, or Make the Ants hang and do nothing case its Stuck in a stage . Not to mention when you run out of nurses you are not allowed to hatch at least one no matter how mych food you have of life in the queen that eventually the Queen Startves to death anyway and you waste youre time playing for nothing. It pretty much Takes All the Fun out of the Game . Cause you have to start over.. Start Over Start over.. By the time you start over the 10th time.. youre pretty much looking for another game to play. I Highly dont recomend this at this time. Its a Total waste of money to spend on this game. I wish i didnt even look at this game to play an Ant colony game where im the queen. look to Ant Sim or Enpire of Undergroth for a more fun to play game where you wont lose out to quick and actually have fun instead of wasting youre time for nothing in Ant Queen. Look away from this game for I dont think the Game Makers care for much improvement on this. I wish i could get a refund on this, but i played too lokg in this testing this Acording to Steam policy.  Its a Waste of youre time for No Fun and gets Boring Starting all over again cause of bugs that make game dont work right at times and Baloney Conditions."

Other then that the game works good.(Empire  of under growth) the Queen don't need to eat... If they fix this issue the game would be a good game but as it stands it is not fun to play, because the army is to small and keeps losing...If they fix this major issue. Then i will change my review to good and maybe real fun....Who care this post will not show in reviews any ways so why the Hell do they ask for our input.."

Tried reloading a saved game and I returned with only 2 Ants out of about the 100 I had. It was hard for me to decide weither or not i would recommend it do to the issues I had today, But its a good time killer and you can always restart."

,Not Recommended,491090,26080185,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,killernat,I reall wish i could recomend this game but I can't.  the story mode is a glorified tutorial of building a coloney and I got stuck on building the cacoon segment because of the spawn rate of catapillers just destroying my coloney.the controls are too simplistic and designating tiles to dig is tieadous  once you get a few supersolders its game over you win sand box

The AI is a bit off at times like leaving the nest when you did nothing and they get killed. I do see great potential for this game. All it needs is a bit more improvment, more locations, different kinds of ants and with different locations adds with different bugs to kill. In survival, could have a day change like day to night and while the days pass the weather changes and coould get water in the ants nest and to know how to over come it. making the area underground more bigger so you can get more ants and be stronger with your army. Ants I like to see to be in, Bull ants, Black ants, and Fire ants. (add stingers too for the ones that has it) I await for your updates, as i enjoy my time taking over the land with my army of ants. :)"

I was playing just a basic story mission where you have to dig a tunnel (you don't get to pick the layout of your nest so the position of the tunnel is predetermined). At some point, I had a literal army of beetles spawn right on top of my nest killing all my workers! I sent my soldiers to deal with it, but they wiped (because it's an ARMY OF BEETLES!) The enemies are unexciting and really just become a 'stat check' type of game where you have to know the scenario and what sort of cheap gimmicks it will do before you play it."
