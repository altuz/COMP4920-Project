,Recommended,491160,29332707,Posted: 18 January,all,Heaven Eyes,Ever played Peggle?Then you will like this game!There are similarities between the games and this one is more level focused where Peggle is more of a Story driven game.There are 101 different levels with different difficulties that change the difficulty of the difficulties of the level you're playingAiming in this game is like shooting a bullet at a target 20 km away from you.9.2  /  10
76561198009422163,Recommended,491160,25392259,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,James,"So far I have played 75 levels and I would complete all of the levels but it is 3am and I have to go to work in 3 hours (yes, another game that has kept me up later than I should be).I am really enjoying this game. It does have some similarities to Peggle only in that you shoot a ball and it bounces around Pachinko style until it falls off the bottom of the screen or is otherwise destroyed. It involves both a bit of skill and luck. At first I was very frustrated with the aiming as it felt the ball didn't go where I wanted it and then it hit me... gravity affects where the ball is going. Once I realized this then the aiming made complete sense and my game improved.I have only encountered one minor problem and that was on level 39. I received the fireball as a random reward and of course the fireball won't destroy the greens. The planet stopped spinning and my fireball landed between the planet and a green and it got stuck. The only way out of it was to restart the level. I know it is probably very rare that this would happen, but maybe they should put a mechanic in the game that the player can destroy the ball or if the ball stops moving for 5 seconds it self destructs.For me it is a very enjoyable and relaxing game with just a touch of frustration every now and then.Edited to add: I missed the part where you could move your cannon around. Didn't figure it out until level 82. That makes the levels a little bit easier to complete. I would also like to add that the game retains your score per level, so that if you want you can go back to your previous levels and try for a higher score and your overall total score will be adjusted amy time you get a better score on a level."
,Recommended,491160,29509414,Posted: 26 January,all,Kovic,"- First, there's no way to not mention how much this game wants to be Peggle, even though some reviewers don't appear to see the similarities.  Also, I do recommend this game, but it's one of those game where I am very much on the fence about it.  If Steam had a ""maybe"" rating, I would of used that, and since its not a bad game, its not deserving of a ""not recommended"" rating.- Now that, thats out of the way, I'll give some thoughts on this game.- The game itself is simple in design and plays much like Peggle, however the gameplay is not as fun, at least it isn't to me.  The random power-ups bring a new take to this style of game, but I felt like something was missing while playing it.  There really isn't anything major wrong with the game, I just didn't enjoy it all that much.  It basically made me want to play Peggle again.- One thing I feel would be beneficial to this game is adding a small aiming line.  Throughout the gameplay I felt the aim was always a slight bit off, not terribly bad, but enough to cause me to miss shots I should of easily made.- There are plenty of levels and you will easily get a few hours out of this game...and it surely ramps up the difficulty around the halfway mark.  It also has achievements, with many fairly easy to achieve, and some that will take a bit of luck to acquire.*It appears as though the 100K+ achievements are no longer possible at the moment.- Overall, it plays smoothly and I had no crashes or issues adjusting settings.  If you like Peggle, maybe give this one a chance, if you get it on sale, even though the regualr asking price isn;t very much.  I do commend the developers of this game, it has enough changes in it to differentiate it from Peggle... its just, I find Peggle to be more enjoyable to play."

I mean, how is it possible to throw a ball, hit ONE brick and then NOTHING else as the ball bounces toward empty space where there's no walls or barriers to bounce the ball back into play ??  By level three I lost track of how many times this happened to me.5 balls.  5 bricks.  Game over.  It happened.Levels have way too much ""nothingness"" (Hello, Mr. Level Design, you must be new here.) so when the ball bounces in an unexpected direction (And hello, Physics, I'm looking at you too.) there's few other bricks, if anything, for the ball to hit.  This?  This is boring.Overall:  Ugh,  I gave up by Level 12 (out of 103 as of this writing).  Seriously, go playPeggle.  This stinks.PS - The vast bulk of my Steam ""hours on record"" are just from idling to get the cards."
,Recommended,491160,33135962,Posted: 2 July,all,Caeros311,This game feels like a budget version of Peggle where every upgrade you hit is completely random. Not as good as Peggle - but still good.
,Recommended,491160,29160688,Posted: 10 January,all,Nurkka,Oh it's Peggle! Oh wait it's not?Well yes it is. But it's not as good nor fun.Gameplay and physics are kind of meh. Levels are more or less nah.Some of random super powers are nice but way too random and there is many pointless powers.Even tho that original is better this is not bad. It passes h/€ test (at least at current discount of -87%) so I'll have to give thumbs up.

Biraz daha zor olsa herhalde oyuna top da eklemeyeceklermiş.Bölümleri geçmeden daha diğer bölüm nasıl olacak ki diye düşündürüyor. Fare-klavye ikilisini parçalamak için kesinlikle tavsiye ederim.It's worth it. Level 60 blocked. If it's a little more difficult, I guess they will not add ball to the game.It makes me think that the other chapter will be better than the departments. I would definitely recommend for breaking the mouse-keyboard pair."
,Recommended,491160,25407687,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,Desperado,Fantastic game. I bought it on sale but even for the full price it will be worth it. I just started it and loving it already. For me the physics are good. Gameplay is very addictive. If you liked to play peggle you will certainly like to play this game. If you are into these type of puzzle games this is a must buy. In the beginning the puzzles are straight forward … just to introduce you to the game. It will get tougher as you progress.

The graphics and sound here are nice, but inferior to similar games, especially at this price.  The elements that make this game unique are sometimes fun but so random as to be frustrating.  Maybe pick it up if it's dirt cheap. 5/10"
