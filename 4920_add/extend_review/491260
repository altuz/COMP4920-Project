,Recommended,491260,24223294,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Dark_Sniper [Rocketurd],Currently the only issue I have with the game is the lack of players. Every other issue that is brought up is usually patched and fixed right away. These devs are working hard so give them a chance! Love the game.

Great for people who like 2d sidescrolling platformers and for people that like MOBAs. In my opinion, such a game is unique and offers great potential.  It seems that the Devs are trying to get out more content, which is great, but I feel like they should sharpen what they already have first.Suggestions to Devs:-add fullscreen mode to the game asap-nerf the wizard-fish for more players by making the game free for a short time (there are only 5-7 players online at any given time, this number needs to be ten times as many for any sort of online multiplayer playability)A great game, I hope more players can log on so that there can be constant matches going on. That would be really nice."

76561198051972872,Recommended,491260,26495819,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,GroovyCat64,"Take Thy Throne is a very enjoyable, charming, and unique 2D Sidescrolling Tower Defense mutliplayer based game with a lot of potential.It has a few game modes available right now, such as the Tutorial, Take Thy Throne, Capture the Flag, and Dragon Slayer.In Take thy Throne, your objective is to get to the enemy’s fortress and defeat their king to win the game. In Capture the Flag, a flag is spawned somewhere on the map and you must find it, and bring it back to your fortress to score a point for your team. In Dragon Slayer, you must keep killing dragons until one player’s lives are depleted.There are multiple classes to choose from, and each serves a different purpose, and plays differently. One example is the Helper class whose main job is not to fight off enemy attackers, but  to mine ore, and chop wood to provide resources to expand or fortify your fortress.The developers are very kind and diligent with updates, and are hard at work to continually improve the game, and to promote it as much as possible with new maps, new classes, and recently the addition of achievements, and trading cards. There’s plenty of new content to come such as Dragon Wars, Team Deathmatch game modes, and maps, only to name a few.The main problem with Take Thy Throne right now is lack of players online. As it's a fairly new game, word of mouth and advertising needs to take place, and really promote the game so more people can come online and enjoy the game. Right now, I'd recommend getting a group of friends to play the game, as it is hard to get into games with other players right now or try asking around on the forums to see if other players would like to play with you.After some more improvements, and more players coming online, I can really see this game taking off, and really attracting a more wide and diverse audience"

It isn't a popular game which sucks because I wanted to play proper game modes and compete with other people, also the shopping mechanics are very complicated to understand.So in future, it could have a larger fanbase but for now, it has close to no fanbase.(Only reccommending it so it can become a large game)."

,Recommended,491260,24157668,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,Solehite,"This game has made me realise how enjoyable regicide can be.Seriously though this game is quite enjoyable. I managed to get a few full 6 player games going with one of the devs joining in.I also noticed not a lot of people are willing to host a game, this makes me quite sad as everyone seemed to be happy to jump into mine :PPros:Love the art style, its pretty cuteHas some potential to be quite an enjoyable game once more modes are unlockedDragons!Easy to understand tutorialJumping on other players causes damage and random situationsArcher duels with a double jump are hilariousCons:Why must everyone lag if 1 person has bad ping? I was expecting a little bit of lag because I did open up the search distance to half-globe to get more players, but some of the time the gameplay was pretty bad for everyone involved despite some locals (Aussies) being in the game and having pings of 60-100 while one person had 400+.Considering the gameplay is quite quick, I think there are too many choices in the shop regarding equipment. I didn't have time to check stats between 3-4 different weapon optionsThe minimap, can we possibly get something a little nicer?Can't change the control options yet (other than the direction keys). I've read that the devs are looking into implementing a change to this soon.Suggestions/Questions:I understand more game modes are coming further down the track, but is there a possibility of different maps with the same mode?This one may annoy some people, but for players on a higher level in a mp game, could we possibly get some setbacks so the lower levelled players can catch up? Like less gold/exp per kill once you're over level 5? Or possibly a gold loss when you're killed on a higher level? Also an option to turn this on/off?The guard and knight have special abilities, will you be doing something similar for the helper and archer?I love the dragon slayer mode, but is it possible to access the shop like every 5 dragon kills instead of whenever we die? Is it also possible to get an extra life once we reach a certain amount of kills?"

,Recommended,491260,24215337,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Skyline,"Take Thy Throne - A game with a small price point and huge potential but just falls short in a certain areas which negatively affect the game.The core concept of the game is solid, a 2D multiplayer game that involves taking down the enemy teams towers to kill their king .  It has various classes with different roles yet many feel the same. The gameplay is much like a 2D moba even including a weapon shop yet many of the upgrades are meer stat upgrades and add little to the excitement of the gameplay. The game is impossible CURRENTLY to play online as no one plays it. Like seriously there is no games open. There is a singleplayer game mode yet it is just a kill the generic 'kill the mob' gamemode . Alsothe controls are not bindable either meaning lefties like myself or just people who prefer control schemes other then 'WASD' will have a trouble playing the game.Overall the game in its current state is something worth checking out but i still believe that if the dev keeps working on many of the problems i mentioned it could really become something worth way more then its current price tag.Rating : 6/10Edit 1 : The Controls are now customizable!

I really do, but There are just not enough people playing. Some of my suggestions to make this game better are: Bring the price down, In dragon slayer, let players buy things in between rounds, Release more gamemodes, fix tower cannons,(they're completly broken.) add more  classes, and finally, make the max number of players per round 8. Thank you, I will reccomend this game to my friends."

,Not Recommended,491260,24138595,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Beastmatt,"====Overall=====In my opinion, this game has massive potential. The art design, the classes, the team-oriented gamemodes, a lot of this is promising. Just be aware that there are little to no people playing the game as it just came out. Give it some time. I will change this to Not Recommend if within a few weeks it doesn't pick up players.=====Pros=====-Helpful tutorial that teaches you the rundown of the game: that's always a useful thing to have in a game. Nice.-Couple of gamemodes to play, and more promised by the developers: Take the Throne, CTF,  and a Vs Dragon Slayer, it's good for a game to have more than one gamemode to keep things from going stale-Art design: nice animations, colorful maps and characters; I personally dig the art style-Several classes: Ranging from being an Honor Guard absorbing damage or being a Helper gathering resources, there seems to be a class for every type of player. This can really improve teamwork, and give people different playstyles to choose from-The price: 3/4 bucks in my opinion is WELL worth a game with this much content.=====Cons=====-The Main Menu/UI: Personally, the buttons lacking any animations/reactions bothers me. Makes navigating clunky. I would suggest animated buttons or some more noticeable reactionnoises in the future. I try refreshing the page not knowing if I actually did anything or not.-No controller support: perhaps in the future-Lack of players at the moment-Can't change controls: that's always needed honestly"
