,Not Recommended,491280,30701923,Posted: 24 March,all,Bunta Fujiwara,"- No body customization. The cars look like that from the start.- Upgrades are only decent at best. The game gives you the ability to change the exhaust, pistons and add turbos. That's pretty much it for engines. Not kidding, only those three.- Not much in the way of settings. For graphics, you can only choose between Low, Med and High. There's also no option for Audio and further controls customization.Important:-You are literally penalized for just playing the game.The game has a system where you have to pay for engine wear, tyre wear, and fuel. They all go down when you drive the car at all. No, not  when you crash; when you DRIVE. You have to pay for these individually. My minimal pay for drifting is even more subtracted now. The heck am I supposed to buy anything at all?Maybe this is normal in other games? I only fancy games where I am not limited in something like this. Honestly, the first person who thought penalizing your players for playing your game the way it's supposed to was a good idea should have their loved ones beaten. (Because they are probably equally as douchey.) If the developers wanted realism, work on the physics first.-Wheel users can go jump off a cliff.The game countersteers the car for you when drifting in a game ABOUT drifting. There is no option to turn this off. There is also no FFB, at all. So yay.I'm a wheel user. If I wanted the game to take control of my steering and assuming I'm a GTR fanboy who doesn't actually know how to drift, Christ, I can go to NFS 2015 for that.If you have a good computer and are looking for a game with nice drifting physics and lots of upgrades and tuning, get Forza you madman. At least on that game the developers doesn't hate you and give the chance to earn money.If you're looking for realism get Assetto Corsa. (But you're reading this so you're probably aren't.)Positives? I can't really think of any that isn't already done better by another game. Drifting is okay? Graphics look very nice? Again, if you want pretty pictures get Forza."

Theres not alot of things you can do to your cars the options are pretty much the same. Menu layout is really confusing at times and slopy looking. This game copied nfs 2015 from the loading screen and layout and still did a bad job. Money system is also bad because i drifted for atleast 20 mins and only gathered 500 dollars wich can get you no where with your car. goodluck trying to buy parts with 20 dollars ever time you drift a corner. this game rather be free its abandoned and dead.

You have to pay to repair your vehicle, which is understandable, but when you don't have the money to do so you can't play anymore because there's no other way to make money than by driving. Once you trash your car it's game over and you can't play anymore, unless there's another way but there's literally no tutorial that explains anything. This is an early access title that somehow got released without any playtesting, not to mention even on max settings the game is far less visually appealing than the store page would have someone think.I don't rag on a game too often because I feel if a game offers at least enough entertainment as it's worth than I won't complain, but this was an unplayable burden from the moment I saw the GTA-length loading screen."

Go buy Project cars if you want Sim..Another thing crying about 7 dollars? Really you guys never gave money for homeless or poor people? You won't die cuz of that, maybe the DEV is greedy, who isn't nowadays? I care about my money, but not about 7 dollars, either quit crying or just get a job. Don't take it offensive, but truth hurts.

Hell yeah!+Modifications (hopefully we get more)+Cars+Soundtracks+Turbo tracks+Fuel comp and tire wear.+Online sessions+Physics+Bets (1v1 race)-No option for changing online maps-No Akina map (yet)-Car jumps a little over lamps etc. Sometimes annoying.-Not enough rims :( (at least not for me)-Engine swaps-No controller support.-Anti sping out! THE GAME IS TOO EASY NOW.I bought the game to support the developer, hopefully he is not going to mess up nor abadon this game. I pretty much like it. $7-$10 is not too much either.Right now I would give a weak 8/10. If you liked DSJ Must buy! :D Short review, sorry I have to go to drift! :)"

Now it's easy to slide, but with max turbo it's just impossible.CONS- Game have many glitches (the city map most of them)- Cars not got any body mods, annoying because you have to buy new car to get body kit.- Not enough wheels and also mechanical tuning sucks a bit. I also cannot see the power out put like in DSJ goddamnit!- Why is there no First Person Mode?Finally? Game is good, just it's not ready to give it as a FINAL product, but more like Early Access.

There is a little bit of content to keep yourself entertained.The Cons: There is a variety of cons for this game. Using a controller is super confusing and almost impossible, Might have to reconfigure yourself. Using a keyboard is just annoying because its either full throttle or nothing. The music is a headache and starts then changes and starts and stops. The sound is meh, it's just not what i was expecting. The feeling of the cars was confusing to much, as such it felt like i was on ice and it was lock diff no matter what with no traction. Sometimes when i over cook a drift it goes into what i call mega speed and i go really fast backwards. It was too easy to make money, I used the ae86 on the first drift track held it together for a long time and recieved i think it was over 150k. Easy to manipulate.If the game goes through some updates I will check them out as it is pretty fun to play and will update my review. If you're a dedicated 'car guy' i would say buy it. If you're just after a car game to drive around I would not recommend."
,Recommended,491280,30831646,Posted: 30 March,all,Jihyo <3,"I'll be honest here. No it isn't the most realistic drift simulation game I've everplayed. That's also due to the way the car reacts to sufaces for example, when you just wanna accelerate alittle, the wheels start to spin without any grip/traction at all even though you did not step on the gas. It is glitchy and choppy especially if you get only 30fps (but i usually get 60+). For the graphics, I wont expect much but its good enough considering the budget of the game. Though I think that the road must not look likeICE( I hope that would be fixed soon ) .But I enjoyed it alot to be honest . Money isn't hard to get (if its hard then mabey you're sorta bad at this game :v).One thing that bothers me alot is the fact that i can upgrade my piston heads in a rotary engine (RX 7 FD) ... Seriously ? That's a downer for me.I really hope that this would be fixed in future updates.I'm really happy that the devs really are working hard to fix the problems with this game.

There are bugs that need to be fixed and controllers currently do not work which is a big downer. The game provides a variety of cars and part upgrades whilst offering a decent level of tuning allowing you to somewhat build your car to your driving style. The online works well and the dev's are working on expanding the open world whilst updating the game at a decent pace.Overall for the price its a great way to have some fun but its not to be taken seriously, if you're looking for something more professional then you'll need to spend extra money."

You have to select either controller or keyboard on the main screen on top/middle. The controls need to be mapped before launching the main game.I am not a pro drifter, but this game gives you the feel and satisfaction of being on when you pull off a nasty drift.  True there could be more selections of cars and modifications, but so far there is enough to keep you busy.This game is somewhat of a grind to get money, but the nice this about it is that you get money doing drifting anywhere. It doesn't matter if you are racing AI or just ripping it up at the airfield on solo mode.I give this game a thumbs up because of the fun factor to price ratio. Sure haters will hate, but everyone has the freedom of speech.Drift on my fellow gamers!"

,Recommended,491280,30789249,Posted: 28 March,all,Lucida,"I can't really talk bad about this game as it is a new game. It features more in depth customization than DSJ (Engine wise that is). The body kits you see in the video are already on the cars and can't be removed BUT BEFORE YOU GET MAD, there is for 90% of the cars stock versions with no body kit. Overall I give this game a 9.5/10. to get that extra 0.5 just needs minor improvements like bug fixes. Those bugs aren't game breaking bugs either, most of the bugs people complained about have been fixed. I highly reccomend this game. Thanks for reading and THANK YOU JDM4iK for bringing us such an amazing game!Edit: Still love the game, many of the bugs have been fixed, and so much more is being added every update."
76561198065164525,Not Recommended,491280,31674704,Posted: 10 May,all,dvm28bp,"DSJ(Drift Streets Japan) in my opinon is better for keyboard, now something I can say to the dev/devs, get 1 working to its best before another. This one sucks a ton for keyboard players so if I had to rate this 2/10 for this game, Drift Streets Japan I'd give a 6/10 because it is good with keyboard but it also needs more work into it. advice to the dev/devs improve the work thats being done to produce good quaility. put more time into DSJ and make it one of the next best car games and come back to this or intagrate certian things from it, good idea not enough effort on this game though. the physics on keyboard are trash from this game is why keyboard is hard the physics in DSJ is right on the money its good  for everything; if its a concern have sensitivity as a option for turning so if it isn't sensitive enough or too sensitive for either wheel users,controller user, or keyboard users it can be tuned to the user desire there."

,Not Recommended,491280,35392127,Posted: 1 October,all,Amadeus,I would not reccomend this game for a few reasons. For me personaly I didnt like how the controls were they arrow keys and also how you could not change that unless you were to do so in the luange menu. The game was way to loud and i was confused the whole time on what to do and where to go. I would rather spend the money on a csgo case and key and get blue than play this game again.
