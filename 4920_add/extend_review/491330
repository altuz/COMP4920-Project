Lucky for us, even the downs result in enjoyable time management games, including the current subject, Kids of Hellas.Similarly to Girl Power, this one didn’t touch the game mechanics too much: you still use 2-4 servants to gather resources and spend them on clearing obstacles, with Hercules and Megara helping out every now and then.Whereas all games up until now asked the player to find the best order of actions to meet the level goals, Kids of Hellas decided to simplify the level layouts considerably: conveniently placed production buildings, the almost total absence of thieves, or the removal of cost on the actions performed by Hercules and Megara are all there to make the player’s life easier.…And the re-introduced stockpile limit makes sure that all these changes mean nothing when the player constantly has to manage the resource levels, making sure to not gather more than it can be held, nor to spend them faster than they are acquired.While this new focus on micromanagement possibly will alienate some of the returning players, Kids of Hellas is still enjoyable enough for anyone already familiar with the series to give them a try."

I find it to be the weakest of the series, nonetheless its still decent but I wouldn't pay full price, especially since its double the price of the games before it. I highly recommend getting the previous games, but since this one falls short of the mark it maybe best to start with this one so you won't be as dissapointed."
,Recommended,491330,24293343,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"You would think that the Gods learned their lessons to let Hercules in peace. But Ares had to ask our hero to help him in a war. And as Hercules refused, the God of War decided to turn all the kids of Hellas into an army of zombies. Hercules, Megara and all their friends will have to save the children and to return them home... with the servants doing all the work as usual.It's already the fifth episode in Hercules's life. Nothing really changed in terms of gameplay. Allow me to paste a text I've made for the profile of the previous games on Neoseeker (inspired mainly by my reviews).The game has three difficulties: Casual (without timer and without score kept), Normal (with a timer and with score) and Expert (with a timer that goes faster and with score).The goal is to finish the level by reaching objectives given (in time if you're playing in Normal or Expert). You're sending workers to clean or repair the road, to gather ressources (food, wood, gold) whether they're outside or being produced, to build buildings (farm for food, workshop for wood, mine for gold, outposts for expanding the inventory and to stock faster resources). During the course of your adventure, you may be helped by other mythological figures like Pegasus. Generally, before being able to use them for specific tasks (Pegasus can make rocks fall down, the Lion is taking pieces of meat, Medusa is scaring Minotaurs and Cerberus is doing the same task but for ghosts for example). You can also exchange gold for floating ressources with Charon.Also, you can get favors from Gods by building poles in their honor: Demeter will make ressources being produced faster, Hephaistos that will make your servants work faster, Apollon will scare every robber, Hermes will make your workers run faster, etc.Robbers are also returning: if you leave your ressources unattended for a certain period of time, thieves will steal them.Hercules and Megara are still there: the former for moving boulders or other specific tasks, like saving the children, the latter for growing fruit trees and clean the soil. New allies are also revealed as sellers: for example, they can sell 2 gold for 3 wood.The search for puzzles pieces is also included, to unlock a jigsaw puzzle that will do the same for bonus levels.While the first levels can be done easily without bonus, later, you can activate some if the energy bar reachs it: work faster (ressources appear faster and workers are doing their tasks faster), run faster (workers see their speed increased when running from a task to another), stop time (timer is frozen), more ressources (each ressource gathered is giving one more), temporary worker (one more worker will help). These bonus are limited in time and are resplenished. Their place in the bar is varying from a level to another.Children can be used to retrieve more energy for the bonus bar.Are you still with me? Ok, I'm just checking if you didn't run away from that long description. Let's focus on the other points.The graphics didn't change at all, they're still colorful and nice. The soundtrack is also identical.As usual, 12 Labours of Hercules isn't a big surprise: apart for the children and the new allies, nothing is really different. However, if I'm writing a late review, it's simply because I was waiting for a fix for an achievement that didn't work. Indeed, the only level with thieves was impossible to realize the anti-theft achievement because ressources were at the other end of the map, with rocks and bridges to repair. Now, since two days, they've added thieves in other levels (like 4.4) and since then, everything is working fine.Should you purchase this game? If you're a fan of the series, you're not going to miss it. I'm recommending it to every player out there that wants to try casual time management games. But, true, while the rest of the series is cheaper, the five bucks I've spent are five bucks well spent. I've still enjoyed greatly this new episode and I'm pretty sure that many people will keep it like that."

It basically has everything great about all the games in the series, meaning that the mechanics work perfectly, the levels are clever designed and diverse and the art is amazing making the levels fun to play and objects on the screen clearly stand out.Were the fifth installment really shines tho, is that the developer finally made some difficult levels meaning that, for the first time (for me) you have to work to get the gold times. I usually get gold at my first few tries and normally that comes with beating the developer score too, but finally i am getting silver and bronze medals all over the place with seemingly impossible gold times.I think a challenge is what this game needed, after all those who don´t want it can still just play the game, but being a casual game shouldn´t mean that everything is easy to get.As always i will be looking forward to the next chapter of hecules epic quest as this series is easily the best in its genre..."

The game itself sticks to a set storyline throghout, with themes in every level and cutscenes to match. The whole dynamic suits the story, and the theme of the game - with each level providing a structured and stratified way about playing while still sticking to the key themes. The game itself flows really nicely, with progressions of difficilty and a simple GUI to not overcmpliate things. Some levels are challenging to complete in good time but that ads to the difficulty of the game - to achieve all achievements it took a fair few hours, and as an expirieced time management game player I can tell you that this was definitely worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed every momnent, achieving the harder achivements involving thieves and developers records was fun and rewarding and the final moment when you achieve them all is simply so satisfying its unbelieveable. I really enjoyed this game, and for 40p how could you say no?"

Hercules, along with Megara, must rescue the kids and take them home. Its basically the same as the previous games in the series, except they added an inventory limit with a little annoying ring when you have too much. Some of the levels are just ridiculously easy, other levels almost impossible to get all 3 stars, but I did. This is my least favorite of the series.

76561198112866114,Recommended,491330,26250331,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,kyzka,"I really wish Steam would add more than just the thumbs up and thumbs down. How about a 'up yours' rating, 'you can kiss my' rating and a 'meh shrugged shoulders' rating. This game falls more to the meh side of things. While I have followed the previous four instalments of the 12 labours of Hercules, I'm now left with disillusionment where they are going with all this. This fifth game adds nothing new whatsoever and just feels like a stepdown dlc in comparison to the fourth masterpiece. For one thing the story to this one is that there are zombie children and Hercules has to juggle fruit in front of them to snap them out of it. SERIOUSLY? What the HELL does this have to do with Hercules and the 12 labours? Completely lost me now. Change the name to suit. How about 'The 12 drug induced illusions of Hercules'. That would make much more sense.This is a time management game which can be 100 percented if you stay most of the time on a normal difficulty level. The hardest difficulty is needed if you are going to beat some of the developer’s records. Thank goodness only 10 of them is needed in order to get one of those achievements as the developer record is now getting ridiculously ludicrous. This is now the second thing I do not like where this franchise is going. From get go the Hercules games have aimed to be a relatively stress free occasionally challenging time management game. Now every level has a developer’s time requirement which requires a heart monitor and a fridge full of red bulls. Only 1 person i know has beaten all the developers records, for the rest of us who aren't committed to quitting our jobs, disowning our families and becoming addicted to xanox will only ever get to see an eyesore of how stupid we are and how much we cannot achieve. I hate games that make me feel stupid. I want to feel good about myself. Not dumb. And with all the developers records being now an OLYMPIC task requiring NINJA WARRIOR super finger strength. This franchise is now beginning to become a chore.Third complaint is that there is nothing new here. After the massive leap forward with fourth game this one just feels like a micro transaction. Jet dogs has proven they are better than this, so prove it again. How about a skill tree? A decorated family tree? A Decoration grid? In a nutshell to keep our interest you have to keep coming up with new ideas. Don’t just keep rehashing the old ones as shown by your constant hum drum repetition in regards to achievements.Regardless of all the positive reviews, I was seriously disappointed with this one.1) The story is taking too many liberties for my liking to hold onto the '12 labours' tag. You might as well make the next one Hercules VS Godzilla.2) Thank you for making me feel so dumb and inefficient. That’s why I play games to feel worthless. 'You can kiss my'....3) Try to come up with new ideas. Don’t just change title and sprite colours and say 'hey look a new game'.While it might sound like I’m being tough. Jet dogs is way better than this ‘quick let’s throw something out quickly to make more money’. I hope in future they regain my trust in them.Below is me playing one of the hardest levels there is to get that developers record to show how ridiculous it really is... Thanks for reading...Enough to merit an overall thumbs up but in comparison to the fourth thumbs down.https://youtu.be/6Z8dAsh9slo"

The game Cursor is slower then your current Mouse cursor. But COULD be more difficult to see because it is smaller.About the game.Hercules in this game is probaly the most laziest guy that is available. His workers (or shall i say Slaves), has to do everything. They have to collect wood, food and gold Resources. They also have to Build or upgrade buildings and clear obstacles. If Hercules has to do something, like moving a boulder, he is going to show off with his muscle in a way like ""Oh look how good i am"".The game is bascially the same (each level) in terms of gameplay. There is time on each level. The faster you complete it the better the score and you are able to get a Gold medal. There is a Buff bar at the left. Each level has a Buff bar and once it has met the requirement. You could active one for temporary use. Each level has their own buff and you can't decide which one you want to take with you.The game is very relaxing and calm, You can sort of play in your own pace but also not really.The game is very simple and easy to understand.Music is okay.

And on the surface, T12LoH V perfectly conforms this trend - the visuals and the music tread the same old (although pretty good) ground, there are no gameplay improvements to speak of compared to the last two games, and the story is even sillier than before. If you play time / resource management games for relaxation, then part V is definitely the weakest of the series.However, the only reason I play these games is that reaching gold times are decently challenging, forcing the player to think up strategies and work around resource or other constraints. This aspect was getting rather stale in parts III and IV, but part V is a much welcome improvement. It's much harder to hit gold times, and also most of the levels have multiple constraints that need to be unraveled in the correct order, sometimes with rather exact phased timing. As a result, I'm enjoying this installment the best since the initial game."

The first game got me into the time management genre, and Kids of Hellas is a solid entry in the series; very similar to the previous games, but with a few new mechanics thrown in to mix things up a bit.However, I can't recommend this due to display problems that cause game-breaking bugs. The game forces a 4:3 resolution on a non-widescreen monitor, even in windowed mode, and there's no way to switch to a widescreen/letterboxed display. But the game clearly wasn't tested in 4:3, because on several levels (I've encountered three so far: 3.4, 3.10, and 4.4), the UI covers elements you need to click on, making it impossible to finish the levels. I've posted about this issue in the forums, but the developers apparently have no interest in fixing it. If the situation changes, I'll update my review to recommended.EDIT 2016-09-13: A recent update tweaked the interface to fix the problems in 4:3 mode, so I can now happily recommend the game =)"

My Little Sister can play it and enjoy it as much as I do.+Interesting Plot Line.+Quite Good Graphics Compared to the other Hercules Games.+Decent Voice Acting.-Doesn't Require Any Skill.-Can Get Quite Repetetive.Overall: This game is decent. I reccomend it, but buy it on sale. 50 cents to 1.50$ is a good price."

Can be 100%-ed.-If you want to beat all levels you probably need to spend a few hours. Took 9,5 hours to complete all of them in gold time and get the rest of the achievements.-The game was 90% off so I got it really cheap. Other Hercules games had been at 83% off several times so if you're patient enough you can get this one for under 1 euro.Cons :-""The Kingdom of Midas"" achievement didn't unlock when I completed 4 bonus levels in gold time. Had the same issue in 4th game. It did unlock in both games when I completed the last bonus level.-Sometimes when the moving bridge is on the opposite side of where the servant is, he would run into thin air and get back to the tent. Magic!-The description of ""Speedster"" achievement is not full. It should be ""Activate the 'Run Faster!' bonus with a complete Hermes' Obelisk!"". If you have played other Hercules games (like I have) you would know that but new players might have no clue on how to get this achievement.-On at least one level one of the servants was invisible for a while.-Another glitch.-If the cap is 20 and you get 20 food for example, every time you get not only food, but gold and wood as well you will hear annoying sound.-On level 4.1 there are two puzzle pieces.Conclusion :I enjoyed all five games but this was the worst of them all. Don't get me wrong - it's great, but there are many glitches. Honestly, I expected more from the game. Well, for the price I paid I can't complain. And I love movies/games related to Hercules. If there was a neutral review I would have given the game exactly that. On the other hand all 4 previous games were a solid positive. Actually few more cons and I would have even given Hercules V a negative review...I am kind of disappointed."

The mechanics are easy to pick up, and the achievements work well in getting you to try and attain high scores.You can normally pick these up for less than £2, and it's well worth the 6-8 hours you get out of them.Personally I love the entire series :)"
