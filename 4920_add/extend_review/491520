The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is simple and easy to understand. I think this game has a lot of potential. I have played the normal and difficult mode. (There is a confusing stage where you need to take at least one bottle of nitrogen, you need to go straight and then go down in order to take it, no need to go directly for it.  This was the only thing I found frustrating)For sure a great challenge. It is the fisrt space game I am playing in VR, I highly recommend everyone to get it."

,Not Recommended,491520,23616366,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,Cheesio,"This game had potential to be a fun little experience at a really nice price point. But nope. Too many problems for me to really enjoy it.The controls are a bit odd but would work okay in theory. One of the trackpads lets you move up, down, left and right relative to where you're looking, and the triggers move you forward or backwards relative to where you're looking. The game consists of struggling with these controls in order to try and get through the hoops. Your controls seem to have to little influence that it's just kind of frustrating. It gets even worse if you hit one of those damn yellow boost cans. Doing this blasts you off in a direction that you have no control of, and trying to influence the course of your boost seems to do nothing.I couldn't tell the difference between simple and hard mode. Really. They seemed exactly the same. The levels were all fairly repetitive and a little boring. On both modes I got stuck and gave up on a level which draws you into the wall of the thing you start in, making it impossible to get out until a seemingly arbitrary amount of time has passed when it's then possible to awkwardly make your way out to find the station you need to get to quickly flying away. There is one boost can, but once you've gone out of your way to get that the station is well long gone. It seems impossible to catch up to either if you go for the boost or not.Speaking of levels, there doesn't seem to be any level select, so you have to do the whole game in one go or start from the beginning as far as I can tell. There also appears to be no options menu, which is a problem since this means you can't turn of the naff soundtrack. There are 2 songs I seem to remember, one of which is particularly obnoxious.Also, each level begins with a confusing cut-scene? It just serves to disorient the player really but they can be skipped with the grip buttons. Also each level ends with 2 confusing cuts, which isn't very nice.So yeah, don't waste your time. There are some moments of fun inherent with jetpacking really fast towards a goal, but otherwise thoroughly disappointing."

""Using AMU to move in space, you will feel the zero gravity and the weightlessness in this amazing and highly immersive experience.""(Cluncky english aside) Based on the expectations of the description, there where a few things that became immediately apparently:1) Thrusting does follow a Newtonian model in space i.e. when you thrust, even a bit, you should continue moving in the same direction as space is vacuum. Instead this ""arcade"" game employ friction causing you to (mysteriously) slow down forcing you continuously thrust,2) On realising thrust was... ""arcade-y"", I quickly figured the counter on the controllers wasn't a fuel gauge but a timer making this basically a sort-of 3D racing game. Which should have been given away by...3) The equally arcade-y music.So fine, this is actually just a space-themed, arcade-realistic, 3D racing game, As for the VR? It's OK. Good use of the Vive controllers (slightly odd calling the left pad ""A"" but I get it when trying to easily refer to it) but oh boy you'll be snapping your neck back a fair bit,Do I recommend? Kinda.I felt expectations where dashed somewhat as I was expecting from the description a more realistic ""strategic"" game where you need to sparing use suit fuel to thrust to a goal, not a far simpler beat-the-clock game.To be fair I only read the description and didn't watch the video when I bought it so I feel that the textual description is somewhat misleading.All that aside, the game I did get for £1.67 (intro sale price) is ""OK"" but I can easily see this already being the game that bought and forgotten with under an hour of game play time spent on it."
,Recommended,491520,23605159,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,Sire,"REVIEW AMENDED, SEE BOTTOM.Original review:I was hoping this game to be analgous to the Jetpack in Pilotwings 64 but Pilotwings in space this is not.Zero-G is simple, you thrust from an escape pod to a moving space station's airlock and that's it. You fly to in whatever direction you're head is facing with forward and back thrusters on the Vive controller triggers. The left controller will allow you to raise or lower yourself and ""strafe"" left or right. The game will give you rings to fly through but I'm not sure if it's even necessary to go through them before heading to the airlock. The spacestation you head towards can also be moving a high speeds, high enough to where if you missed it, you can't gain enough speed to make it back and you fail the mission after burning all your fuel.Failing the mission causes you to rewatch the intro cutscene (all of which are basic and pretty poorly done) and I thought that pressing the top button the Vive would skip it but it seemingly just restarted the cutscene from the beginning so I had to watch it anyway. It's annoying since the cutscenes are the same ""panning scenes of the planet and space station"" type deal since mission 1.Visuals are decent enough but don't have their own style to set it aside from many other space themed titles and the most that changes are the backgrounds. I will compliment the audio though, the soundtrack has a 80s vibe to it but I don't really know if bouncey synth themes fit with the dark visuals.It's hard to not recommend the game since it's so cheap but there really isn't much here and the novelty wears out pretty fast. Flying from point A to point B with nothing in between to do isn't fun and that's all you'll be doing. I'm a sucker for space themed stuff but I don't even think I'll give this another go.Update: Shortly after I posted my review I got a friend request from the developer and they appreciated my review and are reading reviews for ways to fix the game and make it more fun. They also mentioned that this is their first title and really want to give it a good polish. I find this to be absolutely excellent when it comes to connecting with their community and they really seem to really want to make a great product for their consumers.I changed my review to a recommendation because the developer is keen on addressing issues the community has and making a great product. Entering the game industry is hard, especially a niche one like VR, and this isn't a cheap cash in like many other VR titles and I have faith in the devs to deliver. The game is still definitely rough around the edges, but if their word is to be trusted, there will be a lot to offer in the future."

The only thing you do in this game is fly through rings. The game does not used the tracked motion controls like it claims, you have to steer yourself by looking in a particular direction and the only thing the controllers are used for as the triggers, which apply thrust. It's certainly not room scale in any way either. The physics in the game make little sense, since there seems to be a lot of drag.The game also does a number of things which it shouldn't; for example it forcibly moves the player down a corridor at times (which is painfully jarring), and for some reason it has out-of-body cutscenes at the beginning of levels.Ultimately, it's quite dull. Could not recommend the game."
,Recommended,491520,23624046,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,@Dicky Spanish,"The film Gravity taught me two things about space walking. One that Sandra Bullocks is even more annoying in space. Two that you have a limited amount of air and fuel for your boosters so use them wisely.Which takes me to this game Zero-G VR you have a limited amount of air and have to navigate your way through portal type checkpoints and make it to the mothership before you run out of air.Now I only have tried easy so far and unsure if the amopunt of boost is reduced for the hard level, But I think the game could do with limited air and boost. As I just went flat out the whole way like George Clooney at a gay bar. Which made it more of a race than survival which I would of preferred. More air less boost fuel would be nice and more small space debris to cause damage to your suit.Some ideas I haveColliding with ships, comets etc should do damageNice to look down and see my space feet or bodyNice to have a helmet glass view which can get foggy, show air and boost fuel etc to help with immersioncontrollers in game should be those joystick controls they have in space for space walksRope which you can fire to swing off objects as you movea way to slow right down and navigate into ship airlock properly instead of bouncing your way in.Overall I think the race the clock flatout game now will grow boring quickly. But make it a space survival with more involvment it could become a real winner.But just my thoughts and overall not bad for the price atm but could be so much more. Pretty much like the Gravity movie if Bullocks had burned up on re-entry and Clooney got sucked into her black hole."

Despite all of its problems (and it has a lot of problems), this is still worth the $2.39 it currently costs.  However, once the sale ends and it goes up to the $3.99 full price -- probably not worth it at that point.Graphics are pretty great and the scenery is decent.  However, it really feels like VR was tacked on at the last minute -- you always thrust relative to the direction you're looking, and the ""tracked motion controllers"" are only tracked in that they show up in the game -- there's no actual point to the tracking as far as I can tell and you might as well just use a gamepad.  There's also no real point to room-scale.The physics are awful.  There's apparently drag in space, and some levels apparently have gravity or something like it for no apparent reason without any real explanation.There are a lot of strange bugs -- after completing a level I seem briefly stuck in the middle of some kind of machinery or something, for example.This is basically the VR version of a mobile game -- short, simple mechanics with no real depth, but for $2.39 it's worth it just to look around at the view.  Heck, if the various scenes and background were just available has free to explore scenes without the game added on, that would be worth it to me too..."

You would fly off into space if there was no space ""friction"". But gravity does effect you in the game. The graphics are very nice on my set up. You basically have to thrust from point A to point Z. The difficulty ramps up fairly quickly and gravitational forces come into play during your game time. When the levels are loaded you will be shown a brief cut scene and that part may make you a little VR sick. Focus on a fixed planet or star if this happens.
