After completing all basic levels on classic ""experienced"" difficulty I can fully recommend this game, especially for ""fiero"" (hard fun) lovers. If you like10 Second Ninjagameplay andSuper Meat Boymood, you shoud be more than happy."

It plays out like your typical Twitch reaction style game, fast-paced, easy to restart gameplay that is easy to learn but hard to master. If you have the money to buy this game, I recommend you pick it up."

,Recommended,491620,30907593,Posted: 2 April,all,✪ typ1cal ツ,This game i picked up with a coupon a friend gave me and ive had fun with it.Its kinda like super meat boy but cheaper and a little less fun.Some user levels are great and the official levels get challenging.Pick it up on a sale or with a coupon.
,Recommended,491620,30910223,Posted: 2 April,all,retoid,"While Beeftacular and Super Meat Boy share a similar theme, they are two completely different games.I am a big fan of this game and really enjoy playing it a lot! It's another thumb destroyer!In Beeftacular, you're a fresh meat cube in what could seem to be a freezer/cooler. Whatever you touch, becomes painted with your fresh blood. Around you are obsticles and platforms to prevent you from destroying the brown spoiled meat. Nobody wants to eat spoiled meat! At your disposal are what appear to be re-usable icicles that you can throw pretty far and pick back up to reach the far away spoiled meat. You can karate chop the other bad meat that's a bit easier to get too.The game was built very well and features some challenging, interesting and fun mechanics in the levels as you progress.You also get to compare your scores with friends and world rankings. So if you're the competitive type, this is the perfect game for you.Not only that, it also features a level creator for you to create your own fun and challenging levels!I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys platformers. I have a hard time putting the controller/gamepad down once I load up the game as it's pretty addicting."

Players can through interacting with many different kinds of beautiful girls promote the development of the plot of the game, and need to be in the key link of the game branch to make the right decision , so that they can reach the perfect ending."
,Recommended,491620,33018989,Posted: 29 June,all,IDNED,Beeftacular is a game that I recommend because:- it has an acceptable price- it has full controller support- it is a good indie & casual- it is classic- it is difficult- it is addictive- it is a funny puzzle- it has a good concept- it has trading cardsEnjoy!

But here's my impressions so far....Another great platformer from Retrific!!! (Maker of the amazing Just Get Through)It really is like 10 second ninja (as the dev said), but to me the controls feels a little more forgiving, and the solutions to the levels seem a little more flexible. Also I like the visual style better. I can't wait to unlock the additional visual themes.I like the blood/paint splatter left all over the place, and that it remains after each attempt, so that when you finally complete the level after your 20th try, you look back at the level and see your many failures painted all over the landscape, and you think....""Finally did it!!......just.""I'm up to about level 16 or so, and already there's been a few tricky levels I only just managed to complete in 9.9 seconds. I shudder to think how hard level 100 is going to be.Well done, Retrific.If this game gets updated as much as Just Get Through, it's gonna get even more amazing too."

Well it's SUPER SIMILIAR like meatboy. The only difference is that you are able attack and kill things in order to finish a level. There is also a timer and you will lose the level if you have either died or the time ran out.So if you are familiar with ""meatboy"" then you will have no problems with this game. You are able to double jump, wall jump, shoot a ranged attack and melee attacks. One goal, Kill all enemies within the time limit.There is a reset level button.There is options in-game.Repetitive gameplay.Weird music.Easy to understand and controls.You also have that ""meat"" trail behind you like in meatboy.Other things.Meatboy clone (with abit of extra addons).-------------------I Give this game a 6/10"

,Recommended,491620,31657264,Posted: 9 May,all,Mindbuzz,"Obviously similar to Super Meat Boy. And Super Meat Boy meets... Hitman? HA!Honestly, it's not far off from Super Meat Boy, other than the screen is a little bigger looking, and you have a projectile that you can throw at the rotting pieces of meat that you must dispose of. This is, after all, the point of the game. The good cut of meat destroying the old, disgusting pieces of meat. And the expected blood trail is there too.I can't write much more in this review. It's just too rediculous. Everything. You can boil (no pun intended) it down to this - If you liked Super Meat Boy, it's likely you'll enjoy this game too, as this game is pretty much Super Meat Boy's younger brother. If it were any more similar to SMB, it's likely I could smell the charred meat being angrily burnt in a courtroom over the similarity in secret receipes. Does that make sense?If you like SMB, you'll likely enjoy the taste of this game too. Order up!Last thought - they should have just called it ""Not So Super Meat Boy"". That's a one-liner reivew right there I should have opened with!"

76561198053765832,Recommended,491620,35499516,Posted: 5 October,all,Mazuki,"Português:Bem eu estive a experienciar a minha primeira hora de Beeftacular e o que tenho de dizer é o seguinte: eu acho o jogo bom mas eu não consigo gostar dele. Para já, partilha o tema com Super Meat Boy que é um platformer do caraças e por isso não deixa de me meter impressão. Os controlos, eu digo que são diferentes mas cá no fundo eu não gosto deles, ao início, parecia tar tudo bem mas quando começaram a chegar os níveis mais complicados, eu comecei a perceber que eu não consigo ter qualquer forma de controlo sobre o meu personagem, os controlos são muito ""escorregadios"" mais ainda que Super Meat Boy, de tal forma que chega a um ponto que é extremamente frustrante passar algumas partes, especialmente os portais, ás vezes eu toco no portal mas só porque tem uns espinhos ao lado, eu morro. Eu não sei se eu realmente toco nos espinhos ou se o ""Hit Detection"" não anda a funcionar muito bem mas as quedas são tão rápidas que eu não consigo ver. No entanto, tenho que admitir que os ataques são uma mecânica interessante e traz uma lufada de ar fresco a este jogo com ar de ""Meat Boy"", além do Editor de Níveis que também é um extra fixe. Resumindo, eu não acho o jogo mal feito, no entanto eu não consigo gostar dele mas acredito que alguém irá gostar por isso recomendo definitivamente.English:Well, I´ve been experiencing my first hour with Beeftacular and what I got to say is this: I think the game is pretty good but I just can´t like it. First of all, it shares the theme with ""Super Meat Boy"" which is a hell of a platformer(in a good way of course) and that always bugs me for some reason. The controllers, I would like to say they´re different but deep down, I just dislike them. At first, everything seems ok but when the toughest level started coming, I started to notice I wasn´t able to have any sort of control over my character, the controls are too slippery, more slippery than Super Meat Boy, in a way that some parts get too frustrating, like the portals for example. Sometimes, I fall into a portal but just because I have some spikes on my side, I get killed, I don´t know if I really touched the spikes or if it´s the Hit Detection that´s not functioning well, but the falls are so fast that I can´t even see that. However, I must admit the attacks are an interesting mechanic and brings some fresh air to the ""Meat Boy"" style the game brings and the Level Editor is also a cool feature. Basically, I don´t think the game is bad, however I can´t enjoy it but I know someone else will so I definitely recommend it."
