Way too many other games of this nature that are worth your time compared to this one.  Wonky, awkwardly-floaty controls leave you feeling disappointed."

,Not Recommended,491650,29257835,Posted: 14 January,all,Kovic,"Not much to say...Bad Gameplay, Sluggish Controls, Low Quality Pixel Design, totally deserving of a Not Recommended. Done.This developer should have put this on Gamejolt or IndieDB as a Free Download, because it is clear that they are inexperienced and are not deserving of having a ""pay"" game on Steam.*I am a retro gamer who loves platforming games, this however is one of the worst I have attempted to play on Steam in the last year or so.  There is an art to making quality pixel platformer games that run well, this is nowhere close to being good.Another thing that sucks is now that I started this game and I've unlocked a few achievements, I will have to try and push through it to at least get 75% so my average isnt affected. :/"

,Not Recommended,491650,31975788,Posted: 26 May,all,Cohen The Barbarian,"Reset 1-1 is a somewhat charming indie platformer with retro feel but undermined by its controls and design choices.Pros:+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Retro feel: Gameplaywise it looks like a C64 platformer, but C64 couldnt have deal that much sprites on a screen, and gfx palette surely has more than 16 colors. So we can say it looks like an Amiga500 platformer with bad gfx.+ Cheap, has cardsNeutral:~ A bit short, but hey, it is cheapCons:- Controls! Theyre too cluncky for a platformer.- No windowed mode selection. Im ok with retro, i love pixel art but this game hurts my eyes on a 24"" monitor man, come on! C64 or Amiga never had that kind of big screen, this is why it worked at the time.3/10 And those points are going to the soundtrack and retro art... Its a pity i could have liked it more if it had a windowed mode and better controls."

I LOVE when the devs read reviews and fix issues <3Now I'm not good at reviews, but I actually noticed that the game does have a cap to falling speed. I complained about it even though it wasn't true. (Sorry for false accusations! Holding the jump key also slows down falling a bit)I think this game is decent and challenging, but has places to improve. The gameplay is very simple, and I really like the music. As much as I seem to dig this game, there are a few things that you could somewhat easily improve:-Rebindable keys would be nice, but that would take a little work I guess. At least implementing WASD would be nice.-Mute music or sfx. Right now I can mute both, but I'd like to be able to just mute one of the two."

I would love to see some improvement of this same feature in another game.I like the weapons, there are only four, and three of them are actual secrets, but each one has a cool concept and design.I can't say this a bad game, it has it's own good and bad things but it's an enjoyable little adventure and is not even that expensive.In the end, you can see that the developers need to learn more, but they've tried some things with this game and they can now take what they learned and polish those things to make something better. They have all my support."

My only problems with this are that controls and movement don't meet up with the precision needed to get through most of the levels, so you can easily be stuck on a single jump for a massive portion of your session.I would recommend this if you're just planning on playing this for nostalgia rather than actually beating the game."
,Not Recommended,491650,29250113,Posted: 14 January,all,atomicmutilator,"Controls aren't very good and can't be changed, motion and feel of the game is just very laggy-ish, ity feels like youre always in slow motion. Coins do nothing and are just a collectible. Playing fullscreen is awful, graphics are way too overblown and field of view is just tiny. Had to play it in a window. Story not even that great. Can't possibly recommend."

This is a simple pixel game and there's no reason why it should be running this slow. I love the graphics, it reminds me of an old Atari Lynx game but it's unplayable because of the slowdown."
76561197983353237,Recommended,491650,28191158,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,batmobilly,"A really neat and fun game, however there is a progressing level of difficulty, each time you die the next try is more challenging, your character will move slower and the general tone, including color, gets darker with each death. It's a very unique feature that rewards you for being careful. Give it a try, I'm glad I did!"
76561198005271335,Not Recommended,491650,29799193,Posted: 9 February,all,Pale Dolphin,"* Gameplay is too generic. It's like a poor man's Super Mario.* Art style is kind of tasteless. I get the intention to make an old-school pixel-art platformer, but the effort failed.* Music is okay, sounds are a little annoying.* Game doesn't remember the settings. If you turn music off and switch to windowed mode, the game will forget it after you'll restart. Very frustrating.Overall, game is too simple. Not worth picking up, even though it's cheap as hell. At least there are not too many bugs, so maybe next game by this dev would be better. But this one? Skip it."
