Gonna avoid it like a plague until the devs do something about the player base."

But when the game was released there was server issues, so i waited for fix.. It happen, but then there was no one playing it. Checked the Steam community hub, and ppl where raging about the price. When i got the game it was 24 dollar, but after awhile the price went up to 40 dollar, and thats when the game died. R.I.P Deformers, you where fun but i have to press NO - i do not recommend this game. If you buy it here on steam you will get 0 lobby, no one plays this game.Month	Avg.

There are no bots so you must be online to play. This would not be an issue for me if it weren't for the fact that I cannot find matches. For a few days after launch, I could find matches with up to THREE other people... that's it. Since then, I have spent too much time searching for lobbies or sitting in empty lobbies and have not been able to actually play the game in over a week.Because of the lack of offline option or players, this game has been literally unplayable for me. It was fun while I could play it, but if I knew that this was going to be another Dino D-Day I would have not purchased it.*Edited May 28 to fix a typo."

,Not Recommended,491770,31310054,Posted: 22 April,all,ScienceBang,"It is impossible to find lobbies in this MULTIPLAYER ONLY game. I have 45 minutes of playtime, 35 of which are LOOKING FOR A GAME. When I got into game, the mouse is hypersensitive, the controls are clunky, wayyy too hard to hit. The soccer game mode is the worst offender. Theres no tutorial. Im going to give this a super negative rating. Even after turning the sensitivity down, the mouse seems like you can do a 360 in a cm of movement. Beyond that the fact that you have to PAY FOR SOME ADD ONS?!?! Listen, I don't know who these devs are, but if they think they have the level of trust that companies like Blizzard have, they're wrong. Thank god I'm getting a refund. Not worth 40 CAD. Seems like a Hi-Rez game (which is notoriously clunky and bad) but you have to pay for it."
,Not Recommended,491770,31622853,Posted: 8 May,all,Dread Pirate Tuco,"You can only launch your game once so you have to do it right. 30$ for this is NOT right. The playerbase will remain nonexistant if this doesn't change soon. These first few weeks of release are important and they will go to waste if the price remains this high.Oh, and the game itself is fun I guess - I wouldn't know since there are no lobbies."

You can't, if there are no players.And I won't buy any credits because the base-game was way to expensive...It's a pitty, but you guys are ruining a game, that in base makes fun and is enjoyable.But it shouldn't be more than 10€ with that amount of characters and that little maps and gamemodes.+ Funny characters+ Deathmatch for kids+ nice locations+ good animations+ good controlls with (xbox one controller)- expensive- not enough gamemodes- not enough maps- Characters only in onlinegame unlockable (no one plays online) or purchase coinsMaybe you should start to listen to the (small) community to make this game a better one. :)It deserves it!"

,Not Recommended,491770,33098517,Posted: 1 July,all,KAYSR();,"Well, the game is really good indeed, really fun to play with friends and really enjoyable.The point is that the price is too salty for the game itself, it's totally not worth THIS price.If you're not going to play with your friends, like try to play public or something, it won't work, I felt like basically wasted money, because none of my other friends were able to buy it. They did overestimated the game a lot, it's not worth if you try to play public because the came is too expensive and NO ONE is paying this price, so basically no one is playing :TIf you are gathering friends to play it, you might gather a lot of them and maybe buy a bundle or something idk, so you guys won't get tired of it so soon.Overall I actually recommend the game, but not with that price."

,Not Recommended,491770,33735746,Posted: 22 July,all,Oppressor of Steaks,"It's a fun game. Really it is. Online is great, when you can actually find people to play with. However the community here doesn't exist, and that's more or less because of the game being expensive. And let's be honest, this game doesn't have $30 worth of content. Not to mention single player modes with the bots completely kill the fun at all (AI is potato) and the cosmetics are nice but require even more money. Ugh.I want this game to succeed. But Ready At Dawn really needs to do something about the price. Make it reasonable, and more people will be able to play this game."

,Not Recommended,491770,31306487,Posted: 22 April,all,GamerMezTv,"update- 5/4/2017- was hoping this would get better or the Devs would wake the hell up and drop the price to increase the playerbase so that me and many others could start youtube series's and Twitch content... but do to the Devs greedyness and inability to finish a product before release this game has died. there is practically no playerbase. and still lack of content!! you guys got me fo 60$ ill be sure to remember your names dev team cause that wont happen again!TLDR: fun gameplay for about 45min at a time, steep unjustifyiable price tag.I do like it dont get me wrong, I bought a couple copies as for me and my son to play. we've been having fun.but i do feel the price is steep tho for what you get. I played the betas.. and it still feels beta and lacking content at least in the betas there was a player base for every game mode, now you're lucky to get anything other then deathmatches. still have only a couple maps i think they've added two since the betas... still only one soccer map but not that it matters cause it seems nobody plays the soccer the lack of players is a killer right now its hard to get a full room and when you do you prob have someone in there thats a lot higher of a level then you and while i understand they get no real advantage but them playing way more then you is a serious advantage and getting walked on by seasoned players isnt fun. so matchmaking needs some work putting people of the same levels together. it has potential but so do all games, just never see them go anywhere else... ill change my review if it gets better over the next month or so if it doesnt by then well then this will fall off my radar and be forgotten."
,Not Recommended,491770,31587248,Posted: 6 May,all,SlimeTacos,This is a fun game but it is not worth the amount you have to pay.
,Recommended,491770,31338815,Posted: 24 April,all,Demon Tea Time,"Looking at the steam reviews I am honestly shocked at the poor reception this game has recieved.  Much of the dissapointment has to do with the admittedly bad launch which came with a bug preventing anyone from playing, instead players were stuck in the ""searching for players"" screen and thus thought ""this game is dead."" And well, due to that its player base is now really suffering.  However, this game is fantastic! The only Issue i have had so far is with the small playerbase, but I have always been able to find a good game to join in spite of this.  And now on to the real review.If you don't know what to think of Deformers at first glance you aren't alone, so try and imagine this: Deformers plays as though Super Smash Brothers and Quake multiplayer had a baby.  The game is constantly fast paced and provides you with a variety of options to go about your objectives with.  If you want to take a mroe direct approach to combat you might play the Striker class and headbutt your foes to oblivion, or you might want to spend your time giving your opponents the good ol'♥♥♥♥♥♥block with the Guardian and kill them with your cube counter.  Much like in the 2016 Doom, you can only regain any substancial amount of hp by killing opponents and therefore encouraging you to carefully engage your opponents if you are looking to come back from a deficit.As for content, there are three modes of play, which is a little lacking, but for me the hidden depth of the gameplay more than make up for that.In my book this game makes an easy 9/10 because if I give it a 10/10 people will call me a liar.  I highly reccommend this game to any casual or hardcore player!If you have any further questions about the game feel free to hit me up with a message.  I would love to see this game grow and (de)form into something great!"

I have this on console, but beta tested it on PC, my gaming PC has a trackball controller - and it makes the game a lot more fun! I love trackball controls (from the old arcade days of Missle Command, Centipede, etc.). Playing this game with a Trackball instead of a Mouse is a blast!I got the XBox version at launch, and yes, it only had multiplayer, but the devs have added local mode and are working hard to expand the game!EDIT:I guess the biggest complaint is that there is no one playing. I do agree that $30 for this game is a bit high. I did get this on sale for $15.I bought the XBox One Collector's Edition at Gamestop and they gave us members half-off so I paid $20 instead of the $40 at launch.This game should only be at most $15 (especially with the microtransactions), and on sale for under $10 so that more people would play.."

,Recommended,491770,31312587,Posted: 22 April,all,TarTar,"This is my first review but I will try to give an impartial assessment. So here are all the advantages:+ graphics are amazing and physics are cool! They roll, jump and this looks soooo cool!+ game is not boring and you can spend hours on it+ leveling system is well done+ design and workshop are perfect, because you can choose a skin for your character, you can add accessories and hats. Characters are so cute, fluffy and just PERFECT.Now let's talk about disadvantages:- sometimes you should wait for a long time to start a match, because some servers are empty- no tutorial but (!) you can watch videos Deformers University. They are helpful.- sometimes servers are lagging and it's unable to join the lobby or you are disconnected while playingI think that's it. Well, my conclusion is following: game is totally worth 29.9, but i believe it's gonna be improved and all bugs gonna be fixed.Enjoy gaming and help Deformers to improve :)"
,Recommended,491770,31274268,Posted: 21 April,all,dog,"for this game just being released, it's absolutely insane.forget what other people in the reviews say about content, would you say rocket league is starved of content? hell no!that's because rocket league is built on replay value, getting better, mastering, and ♥♥♥♥ing up absolutely everyone in your path.---GENERAL GAMEPLAY ;deformers is a third person, movement and physics based arena brawler. it's built around two gamemodes (for now)the first gamemode is deathmatch, or team deathmatch. you know how it works, you use a dash mechanic to ram people off the map, or just bop the living hell out of them until they explode.it's packed with powerups (that actually work, and feel rewarding) and vibrant, interactive maps where you can learn your environment to bamboozle your enemies. this one's my favorite, i've absolutely loved jumping in with a friend and providing fun communication to team up and squish people to oblivion.the second gamemode, for lack of a better term, is rocket league. but hold up, because it's not JUST rocket league, it's rocket league with hilarious character, physics, and far smoother gameplay. you roll, grab, toss, lob, your way to victory in a team versus team arena, the game from the stands doesn't look like it's too complicated, but it really is jam packed with advanced mechanics where you can, if mastered, throw the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything and feel like a genius.technical wise, the game runs smooth, it's fast paced, fluid, you never skip a second of being able to interact with it. nothing feels on a grid, even the menus are this jiggly, fun experience.---CUSTOMIZATION ;people talk a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥on customization mechanics, people make fun of unlocking hats, but let me tell you, this game does it so beautifully. the variety is SHOCKING, there's literally SO MUCH YOU CAN UNLOCK? i almost cried when i first visited those menus.HATS, GLASSES, BACKPACKS, SOUND PACKS, SPRAYS ETC. ALL UNLOCKABLE WITHOUT DROPPING A PENNY.dude, there is h u n d r e d s of items.---SUMMARY ;dude, it's REALLY, REALLY, good. thirty dollars? honestly, with the production quality and development + fine tuning, i'd feel awful asking for anything less.every once in a while, something will come into your life where you wake up, think about it, go throughout your day thinking about it, and when you lay your head on that cold pillow, you still feel jitters in your fingers thinking about it.deformers is that game, don't be hesitant, don't second guess, it really is wonderful. if you like fast paced, high skill cap, fun, physics brawlers that'll have you ♥♥♥♥ing crying laughing, you'd be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to ask for any game other than deformers."
