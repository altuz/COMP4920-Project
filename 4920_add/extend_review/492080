The art is lovely but the game is insubstantial. It's too short and rushed to leave any kind of impact. The heroine is lovely, but like any generic cute girl. The game fails on its promise to tell about Iceland, and about its ""legends"" --you know what I'm talking about.There are some games that are imbued with indie charm despite their limitations, but sadly this isn't one of them.Anyway I don't regret buying the game and I wish the best of luck for Purin and the people involved in the project. Beginnings are hard."
,Not Recommended,492080,30536568,Posted: 15 March,all,strayseer,"As much as I appreciate the effort that probably went into this novel (especially on the art front), I can't bring myself to recommend it. The art is pretty (although it can be off-putting if you're not into the overly-anime style; also,although the MC says Gryla has remarkably pointy elf ears, her ears are average and human-looking, both in sprites and in CGs), the GUI and backgrounds are beautiful, and it certainly has a nice amount of CGs in comparison to its length, but it doesn't have many redeeming qualities besides those. The premise could have been interesting, but it is not explored to its full potential and some actions taken by the characters seem random or unnatural due to how rushed the whole thing is. The story is also too short to properly get into or to allow you to be truly involved with the characters. Despite the ""Extras"" option on the main menu, it is not really available and you can't view a CG Gallery or anything of the sort. Lastly, the end doesn't make much sense, and given what the story provides you with, you're not really sure whether there is an unspoken explanation for it or just a gaping plot hole. Considering the existence of free VNs out there that last up to 10 hours and have more captivating characters and complex storylines, I sadly cannot recommend this one."

I loved the fact that the story takes place in Iceland, a colleague of mine went there once and said that it was an amazing country. I really wanted this VN to be a bit longer, just when I started to get more into the story, it was over. Hopefully, the upcoming side story will explain more about Gryla.6/10."

It is like cramming a whole year of relationship into a single night.I don't recommend at all. Other free VNs are much better than this."
,Recommended,492080,30874140,Posted: 1 April,all,✔kupis1408,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the story was short, indeed too short that even I had no opportunity to yawn (which I occasionally do while reading any visual novels regardless of good or bad the story).The personalities given for characters were easy to understand, but in term of character development between them, it still has some lacking on it, which I felt awkward at some point thus making the relation felt shallow, felt rushed & not connected deep enough to leave major impact at the end.But still kudos to the team, this novel nevertheless is still good for introduction to those who are new to kinetic visual novel. Light & casual story suitable for everyone, beautiful arts, also nice BGM. Dont bother pay it at full price, wait for the sales instead :)"
,Not Recommended,492080,25789200,"Posted: 30 September, 2016",all,Nardio,"Vision of Aurora Borealis is a bad kinetic visual novel experience that managed to hit all the wrong notes. Besides the art, nothing about this visual novel worked for me. Even then the art was uneven. The writing was poorly edited and the story feels rushed and poorly paced.THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE VISION OF AURORA BOREALIS IS SLAPDASH.Vision of Aurora Borealis is a kinetic experience. I really wish it wasn’t because the writing makes the protagonist come off as an jerk. I really wish I was able to play this and make some choices. Better choices. The story reads as if someone was playing through a visual novel making all of the wrong choices.It sucks and it’s frustrating to read.Check out my full review of this mess on my website where I take this mess apart:http://nardio.net/2016/09/30/vision-aurora-borealis-review/tl;dr20 minutes of bad visual novel here...Not worth your time or money."

They have a connection, but he is... unsure what it is.Quick and powerful as it may be, and cheap as it is... I might suggest getting it on discount. That said... there might be more coming..."

,Not Recommended,492080,26301246,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,ScannaTheMage,"I felt like this was a VN I wanted to like but couldn't. I completed it in 48 minutes, which isn't too bad considering I only paid $1.99 for it, but just about every minute of it was forgettable. The dialog feels very awkward and unnatural, the music has no fade in or out which makes the transitions feel very abrupt, the story was dull and lacking in detail, and the bond the main characters had felt so forced and unnatural. I will give it one thing, the art was awesome. I really liked all the scenary, and the girl and fox looked great... but even that falls short because there are a few 10 minute periods where you're staring at a black screen and reading dialog one line at a time.I hope the team that worked on this uses this as a learning experience, because while Vision of Aurora Borealis isn't great, it certainly isn't bad. And even though I would not recommend it, it still feels like a good beginning, and I hope they continue to make more."

The Art style is very beautiful and the music is very soothing to listen to.On the other hand, it does still need some work. The music changes to abruptly and there are constant spelling mistakes. Other than that it is a fantastic game!"

The story is one of a kind and stands out greatly from any other visual novel on Steam but it felt like there should have been a lot more between the begining and end of the game considering the connection between the characters. It is easy for the player to connect with the characters and become attached but it feels like there wasn't enough time for the characters to become attached to each other like they did. Though the game is very short and it felt like there could have been more between the begining and end the story i had no regrets in buying the game at full price. It at least felt like there was closure at the end of the game and the characters were easy to connect to on a deep and personal level due to there more natural behaviors (more so for the character Chris than Gryla). The story was emotional and the real life inspiration shows throughout much of the game.Pros:-Beautiful art that stands out from other visual novels-Simple but beautiful soundtrack that adds to the tone-Very relatable and inspirational characters-Unique story with some real life inspirationNeutral:-Would have liked some Steam cards for this oneCons:-Way too short even for a kinetic visual novel-Relationship between characters felt rushedAlso recommend:~Naricussu~Planetarian~Ame no Marginal~Forgotten, Not Lost~Season of 12 Colors~Voices From the Sea"

,Recommended,492080,26348236,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,Ness1228,"I'm gonna start by saying Vision of Aurora Borealis is a short story. And by short, I mean 40~50 minutes short. The pacing of the story felt fast and a little bit choppy, almost rushed at times. I can't say that there weren't any scenes for character/plot development; there were plenty. However, they were all rather short and I felt each scene had much more potential for detail.The soundtrack didn't feel nearly as dynamic and ambient as all the other visual novels I've read; this is primarily due to the long silences (that felt unnecessary at times) in sequences where the light piano BGM set the mood perfectly, and the abrupt BGM change during certain scenes of the story that could use some sort of fading transition. I really enjoyed the soundtrack itself, but I can't help but feel like it wasn't implemented to its full potential in this VN.As for the story itself, I'd call it a short, relatively open-ended speculative fiction revolving a cameraman's trip to Iceland, and a mysterious girl he meets there. I will say that I enjoyed the story very much; I decided to read it after having a bad day, and I don't regret that decision. It was the sort of light immersive escape I needed, which is one of the primary reasons I enjoy visual novels."

,Recommended,492080,34376220,Posted: 20 August,all,John Tannhauser,"Not my favourite, but definitely not bad.Sad story, but reasonable. A broad sketch which could have easily been more detailed than it is - it can be read within half an hour (just) - nevertheless, apart from the need for a little English proofreading (I would volunteer my services for this), the writing is good. Some might find the story's end unsatisfying,<spoiler> but its uncertainty provides an element of hope</spoiler>.The artwork is nice and the music is pretty good.I'll give it one thumb up."
