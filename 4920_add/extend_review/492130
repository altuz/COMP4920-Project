But 7 level in 4 episod is impassable :-( (waitng for developers)"
,Not Recommended,492130,33993609,Posted: 3 August,all,The Doge,"I am writing this review after playing through all the levels and earning all achievements (which you basically get after finishing the game).Pros:+ easy to learn+ simple and beautiful graphicCons:- linear level design (most of the time you have to just go right)- repetitive, boring (there are some new game mechanics throughout the game but way too few, most levels in a chapter are basically the same, last chapter is just the first one backwards)- controller not usable in first and last chapter because there is not ""fall through the plattform"" button- laggy when played for a long time (just restart the game once in a while)- not challenging- sound gets annoying after time (just pew pew pew pew pew....)"

I honestly figured I would beat the game in an hour or so but there are a lot more levels then I thought there would be. Overall I'm happy with my purchase."

,Recommended,492130,31646441,Posted: 9 May,all,caubert,"6/10I highly recommend this came. It's casual, not even a true platformer, but no matter it's freaking FUN. Fun is the main concept of this game and the devs have made it so that even repetitive levels seem fun. Yeah, so go get it. It's a must when you got a coupon to bare.Anyways, music is awesome, gameplay is wasd and easy extra keys, graphics are coloured and alien-like dungeons, so go for it."

I don't think this game is worth $5 but totally worth it for a discounted price. A nice game to play on days when you are bored.Pros:Nice audio/soundtrackLife-like characters with personalityNeed to use strategy to defeat enemiesGood for boring daysUpgradable guns with moneyNice combat and movement systemEverything else!Pros:Can get laggy if played too long in one sitting (Just restart game)Short story line, wish there was more to do since I beat the game quickly"

But I can honestly say that after playing an hour of it, it was really fun. It's a quick game to kill some time if you have an hour to kill or so."
,Recommended,492130,31468853,Posted: 30 April,all,Fr3derik,"Puzzle-Shooting-Platformer game. A little alien crashed down from sky has to escape the lab used to keep him locked by a group of people. You can find different unlockable weapons, a nice graphic and different enemies. Shooting  is the main concept of the game, collect the coins dropped after your kills and upgrade your guns at the market place. Very simple gameplay but you are not going to be able to use your  mouse, only keyboard configuration. A part that, it could be much better but the game is still funny and enjoyable to be played. A nice game for some fun but not too much and  the friendly price makes this game a good "" let's give a try"" title.PS: Everything u read in here is a personal statement, coming from my point of view and maybe not reflecting what the game itself looks like."

,Recommended,492130,34707143,Posted: 3 September,all,Dorkificus Bolt.gg,Somewhat difficult. Poorly programmed though. Lags a lot. A little bit of farming is required to 100% the game. It's like a 6-7 hour game.

,Not Recommended,492130,34308848,Posted: 17 August,all,ロールちゃん,"A very simple and casual game that I just can't recommend.Despite the game working as intended, Its gameplay is very repetitive and uninspired.I gave it a chance, and once I got to the vehicle section, I couldn't take it anymore.Let's just say that the repetitive and uninspired nature of this game is VERY blatant during that vehicle section...If you are interested in this game, get it during a discount only."

76561198125191044,Recommended,492130,30438100,Posted: 10 March,all,Zaku II (laggy addon collector),"It may seem easy-peasy at first, but it quickly becomes challenging as you progress. I found that out the hard way. The music actually goes with the situation at times, and the gameplay is rather smooth. The Biggest Irony is that the final boss is  easier to beat than an earlier one. Still, if you like crazy things with aliens and blasters, then this is for you."

,Not Recommended,492130,26553074,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,fantomchoder,"Overall it felt like a decent shooting game but your character feels too limited. This game would be great if it had the following: 1) you should be able to shoot behind you while running away (causes almost all my deaths / conflicts between camera and gun), and 2) allow crouching to help give you more options to dodge enemy fire."

Players can through interacting with many different kinds of beautiful girls promote the development of the plot of the game, and need to be in the key link of the game branch to make the right decision , so that they can reach the perfect ending."
