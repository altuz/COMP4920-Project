I can't support such a terrible money scheme and my review stays negative until they stop this.The game is in early access. That means all content being added should be content for the full game. So why are they locking it behind a paywall, when there isn't enough content as it is and the game isn't even out?"

,Recommended,492150,30611139,Posted: 19 March,all,ImmortalConfusion,"I'd be lying if I said that this game doesn't have potencial, this game is full of potencial,but for now the game is very, very bare bones, the devs care about this game creator a lot, so I think that new mechanics,furniture, npc's and enemies are gonna come out very soon.If you like making your own adventures or games, you should try this out.Here's a list of features I would love to see.1. Make objects unbreakable. ( Like choose a single object or a whole region )2. Make stuff fall out of pots and crates that you can break. ( Like potions and coins )3. More skills and RPG elements. ( New abilities equipable armor, swords, amulets )4. Delete objects. You can undo objects, but I haven't found a button to delete them.( Maybe all of these features are in the game allready, but I'm just too stupid to figure them out lol )"
,Recommended,492150,33663181,Posted: 19 July,all,AjiMundi,"It's okay. You can't do much outside of designing your own worlds and put your story in it. Game mechanics are pretty much limited to what the devs made available. So, aside from story and map design, all worlds you can play would feel pretty much the same.But there is hope yet for more, as it is still Early Access. The devs are quite active, so hopely there would be more good things to come.I'd give this a score of 3.8 out of 5. I have to deduct a whole point for the premature Egypt-themed DLC release. Hopefully this would not be an ongoing trend, where every single world theme variation would cost you."
,Recommended,492150,30784031,Posted: 27 March,all,The Fire Oracle,"Pretty fun so far. I can hardly wait until the loot system gets implemented. I love the in-game World Hub set up. Making custom worlds was pretty easy and very fun. Easiest quest creation system I have ever interacted with so far. This program has a lot of potential. I cant wait to see what gets added to it in the future. This could have unlimited assets added to it as far as add-ons and such go. I noticed the mobs auto level up to match the level of the player character. I am assuming this because they never became easier to kill even at higher levels. Definitely need gear or something to remedy this. Over all I like this game. Knowing the Devs, this game will only get better. Two thumbs up!Cheers!!"

This game has enormous potential, but seems to be in a pre-alpha state.  It needs more camera control options, player needs ability to jump, quest AI characters need to have way points too, there needs to be dialogue choices (example: AI character says 'will you help me' and the creator can set different answers to choose from).  Go and buy the game ModNation Racers for PS3, your level editor is very similar to theirs but it has much better controls, features, and options for designing terrain and laying down structures.  If you can mimic ModNation Racers as far as map design goes then it'll be a hit!"

The sound matches the atmosphere of the game, there is not voice acting for any NPC or even your main character.Gameplay wise there are 5 characters or classes you can choose from, 2 damage dealers, 2 tanks, and 1 glass cannon, they have their own set of skills and its very situational when it comes to tanks, so choose wisely.In terms of Quests you need to download worlds from the workshop to have new quests and experience new worlds. If any of the workshop worlds arent for you then you can make your own world and have your own quests, and the world builder is simple and workable.So in the end this game is worth buying and spending your time on, so give it a chance and you will end up liking it and the developers are active and help if you have any problems, its an active community, however multiplayer aspect is still to be implemented properly, give it a while and this game will become your casual pleasure over time.Previous Review:Well I wanted to give it a good review however there is an issue with my game you see. I bought it and installed it and to my surprise there is absolutely no sound. I tried to look into the settings but my volume option is set to max. I dont know whether its supposed to be like this or its just my game acting up, so far i havent beenn able to find a solutioon to this problem so until this is fixed for me im going to say no to this game."

,Recommended,492150,30661999,Posted: 21 March,all,Ohneiros,"I purchased Myworld mainly because I really, really like the team behind this. I've been using Gameguru since its launch - before that, I used FPS Creator too - , so when I found out that the craziest mind in the team - Ravey - was behind this project, I just needed to purchase it.So, after I finished my work (about 6 a.m.) I decided I would give this a try. After making a run in two of the pre-made levels -which are really satisfying, in a weird way -, I went straight to the level editor, thinking about spending some 15 minutes on it before I went to bed. Two and a half hours later, and making a huuuuge effort, I managed to gather up the will to shutdown the program, asking myself what-happened-here.Let me start by saying that the combat in Myworld looks quite similar to the one found in most new generation RPGs, following the formula of the Dark Souls series, and similar. It's pretty solid, and it works. Can't say much more about it however, as I really dislike DS and similar games - my combat needs to be fast, energetic and franctic - , yet I have faith in that the developers will add several alternatives to it, including different classes of heroes, which they have already confirmed. The environments look great, the art is absolutely original, and there's a whole lot of objects to place, break, place some more, and keep on breaking. There are also several kinds of enemies, each with their own characteristics, including creatures that can't be stunned, and even bosses, one of them a summoner; and a solid waypoint system reminiscent of that found in Gameguru (which I am thankful for).The editor, well... it's just awesome. There are quite a lot of tools that allow to shape the terrain any way you want, making the ground possibilities almost infinite. A nice assortment of buildings, gates, adornments, and other neat stuff, in a collection of assets that will continue to grow, talking from experience here (Gameguru, remember?). There are some nice background picks out there, and here's hoping for a lot more. But I believe my favourite thing, one that I did not expect and made me spend countless minutes modifying things is... the paint tool. Yes indeed, you can paint your terrain any way you like. Green mountains with reddish stripes, colored with brown moats here and there? No problem! White ground, brown pathway and a surreal pink border crossing the town? Well, why not! A desertic landscape with violet and orange dunes? OF COURSE!!! I believe that is an amazing, incredibly versatile tool that will lead to a whole universe of creations from many different people. And boy, do I hope that they add it to Gameguru too... one can dream, right?To close up: if you want to make lighter darksoul-ish quick levels, chain them to a whole game, and play them with your friends, family, neighbours and whoever you want, then this is the software for you. TGC has been working in the game creation industry for quite a while now. They have experience, they deliver, and they keep their promises, always listening to what the community has to say. Speaking of which, if this community gets to be half as good as Gameguru's one, it will be just awesome. I absolutely recommend this game, and can't wait to spend my breaks building levels, testing them, and sharing them.Suggestions: 1- the quest editor needs two more things: conditions (needed to take this quest) and rewards. 2- a little more variety in friendly characters. We need a town marshall, a priest, a jailer... you know, the typical medieval types. 3- flying enemies would not be bad at all. 4- some sounds are a little stale, mainly the character's sword. Do you accept collaborations? 5- Modular buildings. Oh, yeah.And finally, a message for Ravey... WHERE'S MAH JINGLE PACK???Keep it up guys ;)"

,Recommended,492150,30638854,Posted: 20 March,all,shadeewolf,"So far I've really been enjoying this RPG builder. For an Early Access title, it already has plenty of features and assets for you to lose yourself in it for hours and hours, without even realizing it. The current selection of assets is also already varied enough for you to already be able to create lots of fun questing experiences.The controls are smooth when playing, and the UI for both playing and world building are very intuitive. I also love that the terrain slightly adapts to the placement of objects, which makes it a frustration free experience (which is something a lot of games don't seem to be able to get right). Being able to paint the terrain if you want to, adds an even deeper level of ""where has my weekend gone"".I'm really looking forward to seeing this project grow, and to exploring the many worlds people will create.  I definitely do recommend picking this one up. It's a fun one!"

This is a good game that looks shallow, but is OOZING with potential. There isn't a ton in the game (there is enough to build a basic rpg to satisfy you until the next update), but it makes up for its creative yet simple design. The dev team really does care about this game and they are very open with their community to the point where I was chatting with one of developers and he was kind enough to explain whats coming up. I don't think he'd mind, but In'd rather not say anything in the event that its a secret, but I will say that tommorow there will be a nice, little update with more on the way.TL;DR  Brand new game with potential and a good, dedicated dev team."

It's a  RPG style game with a world editor where you can create worlds from an 3D view. When i say RPG i do mean RPG, in some of the worlds you can pick up quests along the way and there is a class (they are going to add 2 more as far as i know) which is the Knight which has it's own set of skills which will be different from the other classes when they come. You can even play with friends! (I haven't tested this out yet)What makes this a really good game is the fact that the Devs are listening to the community, which i really like.So even though you can only play through these worlds, create worlds and play with friends there is alot of potential in this game and i would highly suggest picking it up if you think you might be interested!Thanks! -Kev"

76561198072158448,Not Recommended,492150,33556927,Posted: 15 July,all,Kev the Gamer,"This game. It is still in early access. I can clearly see that. I have some +es and -s to write, and explained too. Hopefully it would at least upgrade the gameplay.Gameplay and looks:+ Looks nice and fun on first glance.+ Great idea, making your own world, with quests, all sorts of mobs (mobile entities, both friendly and hostile) and shaping it the way you like it, and challenging other players to like ""beat their game"".+ The XP grinding is not for lazy bums, and I like that. (e.g. 4000 xp to level up from level 1 to level 2)- The default keybinds are a bit tricky. just the WASD and action bar keybinds are fine, as most common games use these as default controls. (e.g. pressing U for talking to quest givers, while E or F is most common in the games I played or used to play for the tricky keybinds.) Personally I use the most common keybinds so I don't have to memorize the controls over and over again.- Maybe a bit more armour slots will do, instead of just the full armour set, such as a helmet and a chestplate and such, but that is only my opinion.- And the most important one: It is laggy (the latency is real, and that is not so good when in combat. It also breaks down the fun and feel of the gameplay.)- You cannot jump. (If it's a puzzle game, I would not mind if the player is unable to jump. Not being able to jump just does not allow you to make a quick getaway when you accidentally pull (draw attention of) a bit too many mobs. In other words: you just have to walk around the whole obstacles.)- There is no quick menu keybind (Esc, Enter), including ""options"" and ""resume"" and ""exit world/area"" buttons. I was trying to lower some settings to increase the performance of the game, but with no quick options, there is like no way to do it.Combat and Combat Controls:+ The mob's damage output is balanced the way it should be. Good job!- When you attack a mob, you won't automatically lock-on target (facing your opponent so when you run backward or to the side you still face the mob and aim your attacks at it). That is fine, but if you attack a mob, your character does not turn around while attacking when you accidentally slash your way across one or more mobs since your character makes powerful swings, causing you to slash and step forward, causing you to end up slashing about like an idiot, literally exposing your butt to those mobs, so you literally have to stop attacking, walk up against them, and THEN attack them again. This causes you to have (a bit of) trouble with already one mob. The lock-on option does not work properly though (Been slamming that TAB button and still no lock-on target).- When you look at a mob, or attack it, you cannot see it's stats tooltip (e.g. health, mana/energy, level, buffs, etc. Just the target tooltip).- The regular attack costs a lot of energy. Maybe so you won't be able to swiftly kill a mob, some way of balance, but I don't know. For me personally it's kind of weird.Actually I don't know if I actually should recommend it or not, since it is still early access. I just wanted to leave the recommend field blank, because I just can't judge a game while it is still not finished. Feels like judging a book by it's cover, if you understand what I mean. But for now It's probably a no because the gameplay and combat has more -s than +es, though the +es are strong ones."

Quest creation is simple but very flexible.I would like to be able to reward the player with items directly from the quest giver as well as the key reward but I love the fact you can fill a building with a with treasure and then specify the key that unlocks it from the quest giver without having to create each individual door. Everything in that building is automatically grouped so you can move the building at will and everything inside moves with it.I would like the ability to lock the objects so you don't acidentally move the buildings around which happened to me a few times.Creating a quest is done completly from the NPC which I really appreciate. It's very easy to create challenging quests quickly.Creating the atmosphere or biome is similar to disney infinity you choose the skybox and that creates the mood for the world.The character creator allows you to create NPC's and opponents.you can shape the terrain and also create impressive landscapes by combining preset mountains and landmasses.Overall it's heading in the right direction as far as simplicity which is no suprise since this is from the same publisher of game guru and FPS Creator another excellent tool.RECOMMENDEDB1trider

The only thing this engine has going for it is the ease of use.  When I purchase an engine to make my own creations (as advertised on the website), I should be allowed to decide the balancing. Things like weapon strength and game balancing are all decided for you?  Wait though, isn't that up to me?  The creator?  Nope, not here. The engines developer does that for you.  Wait, what? =D""With a powerful yet easy to use editor, you can create worlds in exactly the way you want to play.""  Says the website.However, as new updates come out, you are stuck with the engine developers stats and balancing they chose to offer you.From a recent update we recieved:* Weapon damage balancing//  Shouldn't this be our choice, in our own game?* Blue weapons of the next difficulty level will be better than previous level epics// What if I want those weapons to be weak or even stronger?  Again, not my choice?* An epic weapon from one difficulty level is a good starting point for the next difficulty level// What if I want two per difficulty level?  Is this my game I'm creating, or yours?* Enemies in later difficulty levels no longer take seemingly endless hits to kill//  What in the heck?  Don't I decide in my game or creation what enemies take to kill?* Spelling mistakes fixed in loot//  Ok, great!* Healing over time and life on hit have been nerfed//  Again, why is this decided for me?* When you loot a weapon the info box showing what you received now comes up in the bottom left corner// Sounds good.* Elite boss now drops rare+ loot in line with the other bosses//  Omg, can I customize this in my own game please?* Increased the drop rate for legendary items//  How about I decide the drop rate for things such as this?  Do I even want legendarys in my game?The only three positives I can honestly give this engine is the cheap price and the fact it has many assets to populate your ""creations"" with.  It is updated regularly.  However, it's advertised as an action rpg maker.  So when I seen this, I thought I was going to be given the opportunity to decide it's questing, looting, stats, etc.  My first thought was, ""finally an rpg maker type engine, only in 3D!!""  I don't understand why these stats are chosen for me?  It's as if Unity3D was to come out and say ""here create a first person shooter, but weapon strength and character run speed and health will be decided by us, not you the creator.""It's advertised as an customizable game engine for action rpg makers.  This is why I gave this engine a negative review.  My review honestly when I initially wrote it was positive, and now I'm changing that.  If it wasn't for the cheap price I would of asked for my money back.  I know and yes I do realize it's early access and things can change daily.  However, a big selling point for me was the ability to kind of run free with an engine like this, and I feel as though it does way to much hand holding.  This could honestly be the thing that takes a 2D Rpg Maker off the map, because the potential and developer are passionate about this project.  As of right now though, my review has to change.  I feel as though we are going to get nothing but cookie cutter projects that all feel, look and loot the same, just like when First Person Shooter Creator was first introduced to us in early 2000's.  However, at least you could customize in that engine."

Its very easy and interesting to play the maps that other people make, and feels great when people play yours and comment positively. The community is friendly, helpful, and active.It still needs more content and tools before its a real game, but for early access its amazingly well polished and is on track to be something I can see easily spending hundreds of hours in.Note on DLC in Early Access: The devs work hard, I'm not against supporting them. If it ever feels like the producers are selling DLC out of greed and not putting that revenue back into the game, I will immediately change my review to negative. Currently, that is not the case and I do not regret buying it.Update: Since buying the game, the number of resources and tools available has improved vastly, and the addition of parrying has greatly improved combat and works nicely with dodge roll. The game continues to improve and I can't say enough good things about it."
,Recommended,492150,34728325,Posted: 3 September,all,OatHead (10r0),"I gave it a recommendation, but only barely. The game functions, it is fun for a brief time. The mechanics are simple. There is very little difference between classes. I beat all official content in 2.5 hrs. Even at 60% off, that is a small amount of content for the price. This would probably be better for parents with young children so they could make an adventure that they would play. I guess I overestimated the word ""Action"" in the title, as it was lacking."

You can essentially shape your own world and create NPC's to give quests and etc. The best part about this game is that your creativity can take you pretty far and the Devs are still updating it consistently unlike some other early access titles. It is still in the development stages, but I see this game having great potential."

But if this game, keep updating things like objects, bosses, or even maps. Maybe you can get this idea, to make this game even better.I don't know if I am the only one who would love to have a Tool that let you create your custom characters for add to your game. But I will even pay it like a DLC if this tool is on the FULL GAME. Just an Idea that will make this game (At least for me) A masterpiece! Keep the Good Work guys! I love this game :)"

,Not Recommended,492150,30780690,Posted: 27 March,all,Absolute Madman✨,"I have many gripes. This game smells like it was a magnum opus from the word go. A bit of constructive critism then.Needs Fixing:-Combat needs to be fluid and the gooie sticky feeling of the melee needs to be fixed.-Leveling up needs to have weight rather than just being token, I feel it could be used to gain the abilities rather than them being unlocked from the get go.-The hub world should be optional, if not removed. It puts a barrier between the player and the game. However, if you incorporated it into gameplay it wouldn't be a pain. Simply lessing the distances between things, removing some of the clutter, scaling things back. That sort of thing. I can see it working better on an island or inside a house, but right now if feels like a rip from Runescape.-A day night cycle perhaps?-Making friendly NPC's can't be that hard eh lads? Just change their enemy flag to another team and make it an enemy to the originals with a reskin? No?-Using the 'E' key as an action key and putting the potions anywhere else is desired. If popular culture dictates certain trends, it might be because they work well, such a thing is usually a good idea to follow.-List the keys in a long page instead of bit by bit, its hard to navigate.-The editing tools need a remake, more select and then click rather than click and boom there it is.-Make the rotation not a single key, roundabouting is outdated and bad. Use the 'E and Q' keys, or the arrows.-Enemy noises could be backed down a little, more boney, less gobliny, although I understand the artistic choice you took, so not too hard on it.-Damage feedback is a bit wanky, sometimes an enemy will connect, sometimes it will not. It just depends on how the stars are I guess.-Remove the videos from the hub world and add them in a tutorial section in a menu. (Escape is always menu, escape is always menu, escape is always menu, ect ect.)-Blocking is needed. Dark souls works in dark souls because it blends both. This has only dodge rolling, and to a weird key. Why not have it as block + Run? Wait, no block.-Health potions shouldn't be unlimited, every levelup I had I got new potions, which I used to kill enemies to get more potions. It takes alot of fun out of it.-Do the NPC's have bricks on their shoes? Move them around, reskin a chicken or something please.-""Alot of items, without need, is nothing."" 200+ Objects is alot, yes. Ask for community suggestions. Add as many as you can that apply to more than one situation. I can only fight skeletons for so long you see. Let me farm something, anything.-RPG Role playing game. This is actually more of an 3rd Person action game actually. It lacks alot of the critera to be classified as an RPG.-Mayhaps add grass, flowers, rocks that are created on terrain?

,Recommended,492150,34435402,Posted: 23 August,all,keldorian,So first i would like to address all the whiners in the room about the DLC in early access.First: They are the delvolpers of the game they can do what they want with it.Second: DLC is not required to play the game so if you don't want to buy it don'tThird: The risk you take with any early access game is paying out and getting little in return this does not seem to be the case here.Forth: It strikes me as funny that you can judge a game by only playing 30 mins of it. What a crock.Now that being said I will say the $25.00 is a little steep this early in the devlopment However no one is forcing anyone to pay it this is somthing that really intrest me so I paid it we get a fair amount of updates and the game is a lot of fun to create and play.DLC in early access if fine by me I like more stuff and 10.00 is not that bad hell I pickup No Mans Sky played that for 30 hrs just on the release content. This is perhaps one of my most goto games to play.I fully support these type of games. I would so buy more copies so the my kids and I could create together and I may at some point.
,Not Recommended,492150,30784014,Posted: 27 March,all,Beefyrulz,"It's a cool idea, and I want to like it, but it's really clunky, limited content and creation abilities. Suffice to say, it has potential to be good, but at the moment it's just meh."
,Not Recommended,492150,34329383,Posted: 18 August,all,Sir Spoony,"First of all I know this is an Early Access, but even in earyl access it still has to give what it claims it can already.  The game does not do everything it states it does.  For the record the only thing you can manipulate, color, and change is Monsters and NPC models...that's it!  The fighting mechanics are the worst out of every game I have ever played.  You are on railroad tracks when fighting and using skills.  You can't edit skills or gear either.  You can't adjust gold drops or experience on anything.  The size scaling of the monster models is horrible.  If you think you will be able to make a huge boss think again.  There are only 3 silly animals in the game and no insects or anything else.  It's just a bunch of basic monsters that are expected to be in all fantasy movies, books and other games.  Nothing stands out as unique in any way at all.I figured this was a bad idea when I watched their You Tube videos; which seems like it was some guy in his garage or basement at home recording audio on a tape deck.  All you can really do in this game is make a bunch of monsters with ""Sameness"" curse and change their colors, HP, very little gear, attacks speed and very very mild size adjustment to indicate different monsters.No Dragons, Ogres, Trolls or anything that really gives it some exciting gameplay.ABSOLUTELY 0 multiplayer....I found one game and it lagged like crazy and I have one of the very best computer setups you can buy currently with FIOS 1Gb/s internet speed.Very disappointed so requesting a refund...In it's current state it should be Free-to-PlayThere is too much to change, so I won't be returning.  Only hope here is they learn from their mistakes and I will try out MY WORLD 2....if they actually get that far...having my doubts, but nice try at making what could've been a great game engine."
,Not Recommended,492150,31982247,Posted: 26 May,all,DarkByte97,"Doesn't offer everything that it says.Very limited in terms of character creation, all characters have the same skills and only look different cosmetically. Also  very limited gear thats available for the claimed title of ""action RPG maker""...Armor also comes in entire sets and you can't mix and match - very odd and takes the feel away that you are hoping for in a true action RPG.Hope that they update it and it will maybe be better. Is it worth the cheap price of $11? Honestly right now I don't think so."
76561198032132936,Not Recommended,492150,32963926,Posted: 28 June,all,Butcher,"Not really good game. Seen other games where every single aspect was done better, like this one:http://store.steampowered.com/app/250560/Fight_The_Dragon/It could improve during early access, but I have huge doubts so I asked refund for now.GameplayRight now it's empty and shallow. Light attack, strong attack and 4 abilities that not really useful. That's it. No parry, no block, no backstab, no ranged weapon, no magic... All types of weapon have same moveset. Combat system is plain bad. Aall enemies could be killed by simple pattern: attack, roll back, repeat. No need to say it's extremely unsatisfying. Moreover AI sucks so much that Serious Sam headless kamikaze would look like nobel prize winner. They will try to pass through unpassable 0.3meter wall(very high, I know) for milleniums and will continue to do so until next big bang without any attempts to find other way. Have I said you can't jump? And also no fall damage, which adds to the atmosphere of room with soft walls.And all of this not even biggest problem with gameplay. Real problem that you can just run past all enemies including bosses. That's right, nothing gonna stop you. No closed doors, no misterious fog in boss room, no invisible force fields. That's not all. When you completed map you don't get anything, not even ""you are a winner!"". Oh, you completed map? Who cares.You have 4 slots to equip items: 1 for weapon, 1 for armor and 2 for rings. Each one of them adds some uninspired stats, which isn't something criminal since a lot of games doing that. But still, loot is boring by diablo-like loot stanards.You don't have gold to collect, you dont have shops to buy equipment, no forges to enhance equipment or craft something new. No stats, no rewards for completing mission. The only motivation for you is exp, which leads to level up and... Nothing, just automatic level up. No skill tree, no new abilities, no stats. Happy adventuring, you might like it if you lived under the rock.To conclude short gameplay summary I'd say that it combines boring gameplay with the lack of motivation.MusicNot too bad, not too got. It's just there.Map creatorOh, let's face it, that's why you looked at this game. It has some interesting ideas, like creating enemy SKINS from preset details, but mostly lacks in everything where it can lack. Small number of props, can't edit individual properties of specific props(jokes on you, can't edit them at all), no logic to link death of the enemy to the door opening, no logic at all, no spawners, you can't create vertical levels, no ability to create abyss, lava, water. Well, you got my point, I'd sent you to Fight The Dragon for better experience.GraphicIt su... has nice artstyle, pardon me.For me it's enough to give straight NOT RECOMMENDED. But feel free to try if your baby carriage had no bottom and you had wooden toys nailed to the floor."
