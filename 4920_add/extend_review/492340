,Recommended,492340,24720915,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,Paidian,"Even though it is in Early Access, the game is fun thats for sure. The art in general is quite cute and funny and the movement is simple (with only movement keys and two buttons to do everything).There are still a few problems that takes away considerable amount of fun out of the game though:1-) There is no off-side which can be exploited and weakens the experience of the game in general.2-) AI is weird and for both sides. The auto switching of the player chooses the sub-optimal targets, the enemy team freezes up and doesn't move (in friendly matches) etc.3-) Player movement. When I select a player, it keeps on moving on its own for a while and it makes you really angry when your player moves away from the ball because some AI code decided that its the best decision for the ""chosen"" player.4-) Pass button used for precise shooting. The game sometimes decides that there is a player right next to you so you should use pass option instead of shooting, even though you're literally face to face with the enemy goal keeper.There are a few other problems but all in all the game is a fun experience for those who don't want to deal with all the buttons and technicality of soccer while playing the game."

It's been a while since I'd played a fun, straight forward simple soccer game that isn't buried in complicated flick controls and buckets of meaningless stats and ultra realistic graphics that chug on any machine short of cutting edge. Looking forward to the advertised features like team creation."
76561198074000575,Not Recommended,492340,34926489,Posted: 13 September,all,thebaser87,"This game is missing a lot of things that make football fun in my opinion, like fouls, free kicks, cards, offside, player stats, and some basic tactics.Before starting a tournament or a match, it let's you choose a formation, which is then reverted to the previous one once the tournament starts. During a tournament there is no option to change formation, so you have to play with the default formation that is set for each team.The arcade look is nice, and the style could be nice too. However, the mechanics are very flawed and easy to work out. Perhaps unsurpisingly, in easy mode you can dribble, pass, shoot and do whatever you want without your opponent ever interfering. I won the european championship with the weakest team, Albania. A nice way to get into the game.Playing at a higher level of difficulty should be fun. Opponents should mark closer, pass better, shoot at your goal more often...bring it! It's just...it suddenly feels like there is nothing I can do to stop the opponent. This is because it's now impossible to choose which of my players I want to control: In normal or hard mode, the game will decide wether it wants to let me switch between players and if so, when. This means I can almost never select a player that is near the ball (or not in time) and the cpu team can just cruise towards my goal while my players are M.I.A.The game already has only two buttons to control your players kicks and tackles, but with one becoming completely useless on the higher difficulty settings, the game becomes even more predictable. Forget about switching between players and short passing, all I found myself doing was pounding the kick button, making my players belt it upfield all the time and challenge for aerial battles everywhere.This would actually stop an opposition attack every once in a while, but more importantly, allowed me to score at least a couple of highly unlikely goals where overhead kicks from outside the box flying over the daydreaming goalkeeper were no exception. While this don't-let-the-ball-touch-the-grass approach looked very spectaculair, I'd like to think that I'd have a little more control over what happens. I also believe that Panama should not be able to win a tournament playing like this.This is a work in progress. I know that. But the developers should seriously consider to postpone the release to december, 2018 to fix the controls, the gameplay and this time, really add everything that makes football fun. If they release it like this, I can only conclude they don't really like football."

Full price of 10.99 (CDN) is a bit pricy for a sports game with quite a few missing features but overall I'm still having fun with it.Achievment hunters will enjoy the game as I got about 80% of them in about 3 hours and they are mostly pretty easy. Many options for gameplay (speed/weather/time) to play around with and lots of Nations/Teams to choose from.Not having a stat or custom league/tourney is a bit disappointing but not enough to make me pass up on the game."

I'm a huge fan of the old Arcade Football games like Hattrick Hero so this game was an obvious purchase. The game is very young in it's development but it's already very fun to play. There's bugs and glitches in the game, but that's to be expected really. I'm looking forward to seeing this game develop. Also important is this is very much a proper game right now.

Reminds me of a soccer game from the NES years many moons ago, I forget the name but it came out around the world up 94 I think on the NES.Fun gameplay this game has, just needs multiplayer vs a friend!

,Recommended,492340,33921994,Posted: 31 July,all,Antagonist,"This may be a long review, so I will put it as simply as possible first, and if you choose to read the rest, that is up to you. Alright. Simply put, if you look at the videos and the screen shots for this game, and you think it looks good, you WILL enjoy it. What you see is EXACTLY what you get.Now for the longer review, and probably some rambling, to be honest.I freakin' love this game. I'm not a fan of soccer/football per se. I played as a kid, hated it. Love playing as an adult. I'm not a sports watcher at all, but I enjoy playing them in real life, and even more so in video games.You know what else I love? Charming retro graphics. I have an Nvidia GeForce GT 2GB GPU, 16 GB of RAM, i7 3.4ghz quad-core 3770 CPU. So I don't HAVE to play these retro games, I play them because they're fun. I play them because they remind me of my childhood.Okay, I know you're not reading this for my life story, I just wanted to make the point that I'm not playing this due to not being able to play something ""better"". The minute I saw this pop up in my queue I got excited. Stupidly, I bought WWE 2k17 because it was on sale. It wasn't good, you're better off getting Fire Pro World. God bless Steam and their refund policy.****THE PROS****Charming retro graphics.Easy controls.Local multiplayer, with online multiplayer either coming to this game, or as a separate game. If you get this early access, however, and they do release it as a separate game, you will get the online one for free. So if the screen shots look good to you, you're more than likely going to like this game.Absolute simplicity (in a good way). A 32 year old man like me can enjoy this game. And a 13 year old kid, like my son can enjoy this game.Different game modes. ""Friendly match"" which is exhibition in any other game. Practicing taking shots on the net. League play. And another one that's ""Coming Soon"".Charming sound and music.Some damn fun gameplay.Arcade gameplay. You can tackle someone, which in real soccer, would get you some yellow or red cards. (This is also a con)CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! I spent too many years as a PC exclusive gamer who didn't use a controller. Get a controller. They're cheap, it'll make your PC gaming experience a lot better in general.****THE CONS****Currently no online multiplayer.Not much difference between the players appearances. They all look virtually exactly the same, with the only differences being hair color, and skin color. As far as I saw, there wasn't even different hairstyles. For an early access game that originally planned (And still states as much on their Store Page) for this game to leave Early Access before the end of 2016, that's pretty unacceptable to me.Arcade gameplay. You can tackle someone, which in real soccer, would get you some yellow or red cards. (This may also be a pro)Virtually no customizing the gameplay rules. You can't turn on fouls, etc.Absolutely no customization of players. You can't make a player. You can't make a team. These sorts of things are not difficult to add to a game like this, especially when every single player looks the same.A feeling of concern. Like I said, this games store page said it would be out of early access by the end of 2016, and we're about 3/4ths done with 2017. I love this game, so I REALLY hope it wasn't another abandoned early access. That would be very disappointing. I am going to do my best to contact the devs before I reach the 2 hour limit I have before refund. If it was abandoned, you will not be reading this, because my entire review would be changed to the same review I leave for all abandoned early access game ""Another abandoned early access turd"".***********************************************Now, with all that said, I find the pros outweigh the cons. I have only done one game upon writing this review, but that one game was a butt load of fun, if a little bit too easy. This IS the kind of game where you can play one single match, and know whether or not you like it.  Also, the game is only 10 dollars, so you're not really losing a big investment, and again, Steam offers refunds if you do not exceed 2 hours and 2 weeks. But as I've said before, if this review has not changed, it's because my feelings on the game have not changed.And one more point, if you have a friend, a family member or a girlfriend/boyfriend that you can play this game with, it will only make it that much more fun.Buying games like this is positive reinforcement for devs like the ones that made this game. If more people buy it, they're much more likely to be able to invest more into developing which means we all win. If by the time you're reading this online play has been added, please feel free to add me to friends, because I can't wait to play some people.OVERALL SCORE: 7.8 out of 10. When online comes out, 8.5 out of 10."

Such a good start to a game in alpha.Fun, fast and easy to play, but with challenging opponents, and just crammed with charm. The stadiums are well envisioned, and I love the pixel parodies. Sorry for the spoilers, but loading up my first game to see, no less, than Freddy Mercury, Wheres Wally/Waldo, Stan Lee, Fred Durst, a Xenomorph, and many other caricatures of well-known personalites and fictional characters.Such a fantastic start to Pixel Cup Soccer 17, retro lovers rejoice!Suggestions} As much as I love the two button NES style, making it a four button SNES style would allow for a manual tackle jump/dodge button, and an alternative tackle (sholder, push etc).} Control over the goalies kicks, a choice between a long lob and a near pass would be great.} General improvement for Keeper AI, not that it is terrible, it needs a little tweaking.} A ref sprite. Seriously, a fat referee character dressed in all black would make my day. And maybe make him distracted or sleepy at times, so you can foul when he's not looking.} Cards for bad tackles, 2 strikes a player is out (yellow then red). No other penalties though, such as offside etc.} Maybe change the menu format? I don't mind but the Mobile Phone Port look may turn people off.} Injuries and substitutions, automatically handled. A low chance per tackle of a player getting too injured to play.} Option for random weather and time conditions.} More of the same! Really is a breath of fresh air to see such a football game out there. Great initial Steam release!"

,Not Recommended,492340,29296477,Posted: 16 January,all,metaM,"Was looking for a 'soccer fix' a decided to download this game, as there is no FIFA on Steam. I chose  Pixel Cup Soccer primialry because it reminded me of ""Sensible Soccer""Turns out, the 20 year old game (made in 1996?)  is far more better that this, 2017  game.Mechanic are very simplistic, which is ok. For game like this it should be. However, in order for simple mechnics to play well, it needs to work well .Good- Shooting at the goal is a bit cluncky, but ok, considering it is an early access game.  There si a ""precision shot"" that sort of manages direction you want to shoot at. But , you can do voley shots or anythgin similar.- Passing is ok too. You can to long passes, which are bit clunky to execute.  You can do ""lob passes"" but again, these feel just like they are  there for sake of it, as both long pass and lob passes are usless when you have no diea wher you player are.- Music is good. An old fashion 8bit- Sound Effectes are avarage, but again not badand thats  it.Bad- Overal Gameplay .There is no sense of tactic or depth  in a game. You can't atack from the left, for example,  do a center shot and have a striker  do the  header. I am not talkign abotu FIFA style action here. Just simple stuff with basic meahcnics.   Sensible Soccer in 1990s did this.- Game just feel dull after few tournamets . On second run I reached the semi final. Granted I played with best team (Argetina) but stilll..it feels easy once you figure out the flaw in meachnics.- It also feel difficult where it shouldn't be. Diffculty increases as your pogress not as per players/team profile. Scoring a goal in a final is a miricle, but not because of a gameplay. You can run across the field and reach a goal. but geting pass the golie is a mircale- Penaties.. I got into penatly mode after drawing in a game , mind you there was no ""Sudden death"". So after 45 in 2nd quarter i just got trasnfered to penatlies.  It was worst penatly shootout I ve seen implemeted in a game.- Oh yeah, In exact 45:00 the game will stop. I had a shot on a goal in last secodfs  and it bounced of a golie. iwas abotu to shoot at athe goal.  Peeep. End of a 1st half.- No fauls. No offsides. No extra times. No isdden death. No subs. No tactics. No players profile. Nothing.This all really make game to fall flat and with no depth. Replaybility is down to zero....as  there is no incentive  to play again. There is no league play  just tournament play (Euro and World Cup)  which is like  8 games. After few Tournamnets (an hour or so)  you will be bored.Overal,♥♥♥♥♥♥poor game. I undesrtand it is in Early Access but common. put a bit more effort. Not worth 10$, Not even 1$. 0.99 maybe."

76561198079307620,Not Recommended,492340,35263224,Posted: 28 September,all,SaintTodd,"First, I have to say, the game looks great. Art style is extremely well done.But gameplay is not quite up to snuff. They clearly were paying homage to classic arcade games, and they brought the issues those games suffered from along. The main two issues are defensive auto player switching and a complete lack of any kind of physics. Personally, I don't know anyone who actually likes auto player switching, and any game that gives the option, I think most of us would choose to turn it off. Even when the game does a good job of giving you the player you would want on defense (it does... Ok, here), it's the timing of switching that matters.On the other issue, don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for an actual physics engine. I'd simply like to see a few frames of animation when a player starts moving in the opposite direction. Just like in SWoS, defenders are able intercept passes made in front of them, while being behind the passer, then immediately start running the opposite direction with the ball. It's possibly worse here than in that game, as I'm consistently seeing the AI intercept my passes in this way, when I press the button while the defender is still several steps behind me.I think if they could marry this visual look with gameplay more similar to something like Stir Fried Games Soccer, they'd have real hit."
