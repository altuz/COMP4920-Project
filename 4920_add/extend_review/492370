,Not Recommended,492370,23883932,"Posted: 27 June, 2016",all,Native Faith,"A rather short game, pleasant and at moments tense and thoughtful... But with a number of glaring flaws that leaves me unable to recommend at full price. I've narrowed it down to two points.My largest complaint would probably be the illusion of choice presented in the first chapter. You simply cannot continue onto the remaining 2/3rds of the story without picking one specific romance option out of three romance options. The game presents each option as having their own merits and demerits but the moment you choose to deviate, the game will wrap up your story with a ""try better next time"" sort of ending and urge you to pick the correct choice.Assuming you proceed to the rest of the story, which is, as I said, a rather pleasant experience, my next complaint rears it's ugly head and strikes out of nowhere. You see, in the beginning of the game, you set up a character of a certain gender, interested in certain things in his or her romantic parter; this helps you build an image of the character who's fate is in your hands and helps to build the immersion. However, while you were given the illusion of choice in the first chapter, the second and later chapters strip even that! I could be playing a stoic, dour, and decidedly heterosexual courtier, interested only in a single and sole true love and... still be forced to read lines where my character's heart is a flutter, his emotions for his beautiful and loving partner swept aside by a single passionate glance from his friend, a character I had been treating something like an annoying uncle. What?! This man I haven't spoken a word of intimacy to nor care about in the slightest?! What happened to my romance and my children?! Did I just throw them out the window?!Moments like those can be jarring and even fatal to my enjoyement of a good story. For me, it spoils the character for no good reason and I can only think the events were scripted sloppily, ignoring the decisions the player has made beforehand. It's a shame, because the game would be worth at least a 5 dollar price tag otherwise. Not to mention those DLC options..."
76561198055593558,Recommended,492370,23777362,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Bardic Knowledge,"Much like the other Choice of Games stories I have, this one is decently written. But, only if you follow a specific path.My very first playthrough, I was Dona Yin de Castillo, a prodigy Death Mage of high intelligence who wasn't particularly charismatic. My goal on going to the capital city was to find love, and I found it in the form of Gabriela de Mendosa, an enchanting young woman of great intelligence. My aunt wanted me to marry into money, but her choice for my suitor was bland and uninteresting to me. My uncle wanted me to gain status by wooing the Queen, but I didn't care about status.So I eloped with de Mendosa. And the game ended immediately and told me that, while I lived happily ever after, if I wanted to experience the other two parts of the story, I would need to ""survive and marry the Queen.""I was a little annoyed by this, but I started up a second game as Don Orfeo de Pena, who was more studious than Yin de Castillo and only slightly worse at magic. I wooed the Queen, leaving de Mendosa alone completely, and entered the second part - but I didn't marry the Queen, I was just one of her affairs (though she apparently loved me enough to ignore her husband). And then, de Mendosa appeared. If she was going to show up in part two anyways, why did my first game end abruptly when I married her? Why not have Yin de Mendosa arrive with her wife to the castle, and carry on from there? (Incidentally, I made it to part three, but died because I was too busy info-gathering to stop myself from being assassinated.)So, while the story is fairly well-written, there's a huge railroad involved with becoming involved with the Queen (I haven't tried the third route, because nothing about that character appeals to me. I can't even remember her name!) that didn't have to be there.It's fairly enjoyable, but that one lack of choice really turns me away from the game. I'm not sure if I'll play it again. I might, but I don't know."

The game has many good points and an interesting idea if you are searching for a text-game based on romance but.... with three main paths to follow, two of them are infuriatingly short. You can only play parts 2 and 3 if you follow the third path.I finished the path I chosed first and started again to choose the third path and continue the other parts and that way a bit sad because it was a path I didn't like.Your choices doesn't seem to have a big consequence and neither the character creation. As you play, you start thinking that will be a game where people use magic on everyday life but there is only the mention of the existence of magic. You almost never see someone actually using magic or yourself.The end was very sudden in the short path and although cool things happens in both paths, both of them just go jumping loooooooots of things that I would like to read. Like... they just do a time skip of some years out of the blue!Although is a cool game, I expected more. I wouldn't recomend buy at full price though."

Being ruthlessness, cunning and deceitful are all rewarded while weakness is punishable by death. You can find love, but don't expect it to come without a price. When you play the game of thrones you win or you die. There is no middle ground.That said, I think this game is maybe meant to be played as a female character? Some scenes were a bit odd for my male one at least. That or noble men are simply effeminate. But maybe that is to be expected in a world of mages and not bloody medieval battles. Or perhaps it is the whole courting game that is topsy-turvy compared to modern society if you choose to play as a male. As in the game the wealthy chase the less wealthy and thus as a male character you are meant to play the role of a dainty little flower. Just a heads up for those who maybe don't want that. It amused me personally though.Dainty flower or not, you can leave a trail of corpses in your wake. It is wonderful. Would recommend doing that.10/10 dating game. I am going to play it again at one point."

My only complaint is that if you choose to marry/have relationship with anybody but the ruler game ends on act I. I would gladly pay for a DLC which allows you to play further and help your consort to build her/his position in the court etc. Other than that - Great Game :).
,Recommended,492370,24914678,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,Mammal,"Came for the romance, stayed for the court intrigue. The length is just right--not too short, not too long--and there's enough variety wrt building the character and dialogue options to provide a decent amount of replay value. Seven bucks is a good price for 5-10 hours of gameplay. I wish there had been a few more options to pursue multiple romances, but overall, it's a fun game."
76561198103953421,Recommended,492370,23908490,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Mr. ZAP,"Affairs of the Court: Choice of Romance, is one of Choice of Games' first games, and also one of their best. In it you play a young noble going to court to find love, money, and power. You can do this in a variety of ways, role-playing very different kinds of characters, which can result in widely varying outcomes.The world is interesting. It's a magical fantasy counterpart to medieval Spain, with another counterpart for Al-Andalus/Granada. There are different kinds of magic, Life Magic and Death Magic, which is primarily wielded by nobles like yourself. Life Mages can do things like healing and some forms of genetic engineering, and some forbidden arts like mind control. Death Mages mainly use offensive magic, like fireballs and death curses, and also lead the armed forces. Unfortunately one of the few choices you can't make is which one you want to be; you're a Death Mage no matter what. Still, magic jousting can be fun!Without spoiling much, the first chapter, Choice of Romance, is primarily based on finding someone to marry to secure your position. Once this is done, Choice of Intrigue is all about court politics and trying to navigate different factions and create an heir, and heavily features the conflict between Life and Death Mages at court. Till Death do us Part is about the monarch's later years and further political machinations, while also dealing with some new and extremely dangerous threats to their rule. There are many different paths and endings, and almost none of them are unambiguously happy; if you get the best ending, you've really earned it. Because of all of this, the game encourages several play-throughs.It should also be noted that you can only go on to Part II if you romance the monarch, which is the canonical path.If you're unsure if you'll like the game, the first Part has been available for free on the Choice of Games website for years. I highly encourage you to try it out. In any case this has always been one of my favorites in their line, so I'm very happy to see it finally come to Steam."

Very well written, planned out and gripping with plenty of chances to do exactly what YOU would like to do as a reaction to any/all events. Very good replayability especially if you pick different main paths for your character. Masterpiece."

Oh, and it didn't hurt that I ended up as the supreme ruler on my first playthrough :3That said, there *is* some railroading going on, as youcan apparently only make to the second act if you pursue a relationship with the king/queen.But I think, even within the constraints the game has, there is much to like, and the price is okay for what you get."

The final act of part III was an abrupt genre shift, though, and introduced an outside-context problem requiring a different playstyle than before."
,Recommended,492370,30865069,Posted: 31 March,all,SB_101,"If you're not into replaying (like myself) to get different achievements, it might be a bit short. But I'm very satisfied even with just one playthrough because it's such a well-written choose-your-own-adventure. Decisions feel realistically complex - no good v evil, but struggles between self-interest (from personal gain to mere self-preservation) and morality. I especially like the inclusive-style of plausible gender and sexuality equality in an otherwise feudal setting.The one massive flaw is one that I didn't experience because I selected the 'right' option. Namely that, apparently, you fail to proceed from the first 'Act' if you choose the wrong suitor. This is disappointing because surely a King/Queen's favorite consort could cuckold their partner, whilst still having land and riches bestowed on their family. Surely there could have been an option where lack of marriage raises the risk/reward stakes, whilst marrying for family/wealth or love, still allows for seducing the monarch but without being able to makes claim upon certain... endings. A disappointing design choice.Nevertheless, there is still a well-written, thoughtful choice trees that (minus the aforementioned hiccup) accomodate a broad range of roleplay- a sincere lover to the monarch; a ruthlessly self-interested Machiavilli; or an ambitious but pragmatic social climber (with or without moral convictions)."

The game itself is somewhat challenging, as you struggle to get a good outcome in your story. This isn't enough to offset the lack of pizazz, if you catch my drift. Choice of Romance lacks the pizzaz of other Choice of Games games. Other games from Choice of Games play with your emotions. They send a shiver up your spine with excitement, or make you feel despair at the death of a character. Choice of Romance just doesn't really have that in my experience.I would suggest you check out other Choice of Games games. They've got a slew of good games on steam."
