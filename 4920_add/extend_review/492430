,Not Recommended,492430,24759303,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,Dr. zzt,"As a person that has a friend trying to make a good platformer game, I was glad to have a discount coupon (which Steam gave me for crafting a badge) for this. However, I was disappointed quite quickly after getting into chapter 2, and chapter 3 was even more disappointing. I 100%ed the achievements anyway, but this isn't definitely the game I would recommend to platformer lovers. Here are some things which annoyed and frustrated me pretty much:The game does not show what is in the other world. This is pretty much annoying, especially when death traps would appear and disappear due to this (and would cause instant kills). In addition, there is no visual distinction between objects that are affected by this and ones that are not. Players are forced to memorize exact locations of various objects of both worlds. It's just annoying rather than challenging. Yes, the trailer already shows this, but it's really more annoying than expected. I argue that objects of the other world should have been partially transparent, not completely invisible.The controls were a bit awkard. The character 'slides' a bit when trying to stop or change directions. Due to this, the character falls off small platforms very often - especially in level 24, 'The Real Challenge' (The one shown in the second trailer video). I'm not sure if this is intended as part of the difficulty, but it was surely quite annoying.  It's really difficult to get used to this, and when I die due to this, I really don't feel like I died because the game is challenging.TORQUE. Seriously, why? I'm pretty sure this is included on purpose since there's a chapter named torque, but I really dislike this. When falling off a platform from edge (i. e. not by jumping), the player(box) spins. And this happens quite often even when unintended, due to the 'sliding' problem I mentioned earlier. This temporarily increases collision size of the box. Usually that's not a big deal, but in 'The Real Challenge', you'll know what's wrong with this. Furthermore, torque makes it very difficult to safely land on clones since when the player is tilted, a newly created clone is also tilted.Level 6: Chase. When the player makes the first move, a swarm of chasers (which kills the player when touched) follows the player. There are three spiked pendulums in the level. Each has different periods, and it's near impossible to avoid one when it's moving left ro right. The problem is, the chasers follow so closely that there isn't enough time to wait for the pendulums to change direction, and the level doesn't reset when the player dies. Thus, the most important thing for getting past those pendulums is luck. I tried this level quite a lot of times, and I strongly claim that there is no reliable, consistent way to beat this level - except one.There is a way to make the chasers start their move before I progress. This makes the chasers disappear off screen, and the player can have indefinite amount of time to wait for the right timing. I was really, really disappointed when the dev said 'Good job, you found the true way!' to a user who posted a screenshot of this. (Link) I do understand that there can be a secret way to beat a level easily, but if that's the case, the level seriously should have a reliable solution.There are some minor additional problems (like gravity change taking too much time before the player actually changes vertical direction) as well, but those problems are not very serious compared to the above ones.Overall, this could have been a fine platformer game. The maps themselves were not ridiculous or near impossible compared to other platformer games, although I guess there could have been more save points. The idea of switching between worlds and creating a small platform wasn't bad. However, those problems ruin gaming experience, and I would not be happy to play another game like this."

Definitely challenging, with the difficulty scaling nicely as you progress. Longer levels do have a checkpoint, but a majority of them are on the shorter side, and will have you starting from the beginning when you die. Each chapter is capped off with a boss fight that provides a nice change of pace from the usual platforming. The music is pretty great too."
,Not Recommended,492430,33999111,Posted: 3 August,all,Mykwon,"No problem for creating games that are challenging and hard. But give the player the means to beat the game fair and square.- Controls are slippery: there's some kind of inertia when stopping or changing directions which makes you fail at simplest jumps. Imagine if Super Meat Boy was slipping when trying to stop or switching direction. That's a deadly sin for precision platformers- Traps are usually unavoidable unless you die first to know where they are: that's the cheapest way of making a game hard, like jump scares are the cheapest way to make a horror game- Levels don't reset when you die, they just continue on the same timeline, which means you can respawn and get killed immediately, or be in a pattern where the elements won't synchronize properly for you to finish the level- But the worst part is setting death traps on locations where you have to stand and switch the dimension to find your way to continue the level: you just made it through a hard part of the level and ended up on a safe platform. You're looking for your next moves to continue the level and switch dimension to see where the platforms are in order to prepare your strategy. But BOOM, the platform you're on has a trap in the other dimension! ""HA HA HA, Pwned! Restart the level, sucker!"" Yeah, very funny. How about I get my money back instead?"

I would Rae the map layout and graphics [7/10] and the gameplay mechanics [8/10]. The maps are fun and enjoyable but there's no Secret Coins or replay ability so i will only play this game ones. The gameplay is great just that it's a little slower than i tought, i was hoping for the Geometry Dash feeling but this is a more relaxed game that gives you time to think. Alltought i rate the game [8/10] for making me to do something when i dont play CS:GO :p"

But, it's a shame, that this good idea was bombed down with unbelievably bad difficulty level differences of the levels. First couple levels were okay, but even those were perhaps a littlebit too challeging. However, then I came into a level, where the difficulty level was amped up to 11. It was unfair, constantly punishing the player and I simply couldn't finish the level, so I refunded the game. The trouble is that games have to have learning curve in them, so that you learn to master the controls and basic stuff, before they throw you into those difficult levels. Here, it was like a mixed bag with those levels."

This  a game has no story but still manages to explain it well with its other world feature, I feel like this game is a lot like portal. However an issue that is happening with me is that when im in world 1 ( The one with rain) my frame rates drop. like a twelve year olds balls this makes it very hard to play. But when I'm in the second world the FPS goes up like the Amarica to Canada immigration rates after Donald Trump. I do play this game on OSX if that helps fix this issue. Thank you."

The game is a difficult and minimalistic platformer with no storyline or impressive soundtrack. By far there were only two things that made me go mad: The jumping sound and several evil traps. The game is rather short, but it looks like it could recieve a potential sequel with more content due to a larger budget."
,Recommended,492430,24444313,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,fix3d,"This game is a good and hard platformer. Since I have only played it for ca. half an hour this review is based on my very first impression:Positive:- most songs of the soundtrack are actually pretty good- the controls are easy to understand since the concept of the game is pretty straight forward- it is actually not that easy which is pretty rare in todays gamesNeutral:- there is/seem to be no story but that doesnt really matterNegative/Need of improvement:- the jump sound is pretty annoying- the hitboxes seem a bit off/do not 100% match with the textures- you cant change the deadzone of the controller which is pretty small- you do not switch worlds instantly - laserbeams and spikes/blades might still kill you- there is only one difficulty - it would help for newbs like me if there were different difficulties which would just change the amount of checkpoints there are (like in boshy)In conclusion:Even though I am listing more negative points than positive, the game itself still is pretty good. The game would be perfect for me if the points I mentioned would be changed.Overall I would give this game a solid 5/7 with the chance to be a good 10/10. FeelsGoodMan"

Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game. It's basically unplayable on my macbook. It lags like♥♥♥♥♥♥ To be fair, I haven't tried it on my PC, but I bought this as a time killer while I'm out, so that would be a moot point if I have to play it at home. Besides that, I've only had a small taste of the frustrations that others have expressed re: switching between the two worlds and the fact that you can't see the other world's platforms. It's unnecessarily punishing."

,Not Recommended,492430,35410253,Posted: 2 October,all,|173rd|r00t b33r,"The only real ""challenge"" in this title is defined simply by the game mechanics itself. And I'm not talking about the dimension-changes in the background color/blocks/etc.Imagine you have your white cube. It has real sharp controls. But it's also eternally covered in butter. That you obviously cannot consume. Now imagine the cubenot reallybehaving like a cube at all but still retains the hit boxes as one since itreallyacts as if it is a sphere. Imagine hitting a button that changes gravity. Oh, but not justanybutton, no no no: it's surrounded by spikes so that if you didn't hit itjustright, you'll slide off the edge ever so slightly and restart the level. Now imagine that, if youdohappen to hit it just right and the gravity changes, you leave it to dumb luck to fit between two sawblades that will also put you back to start. A pixel to the left? Dead. A pixel to the right? Dead also.If youare a sadist weirdoenjoy frustrating rage games, get it. If that's not your cup of tea, avoid it. Don't get me wrong: I love challenging games but the challenge should not be in the controls themselves but rather in the content. Solid concept but lacks the execution follow-through imo.However, it does have a pretty solid soundtrack [yet somewhat limited]."
