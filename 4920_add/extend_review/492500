It's a play through once game and will give you about 8 to 10 hours depending on how obsessive you are with secrets.  I liked it.
76561198009897511,Recommended,492500,33017314,Posted: 29 June,all,chardogan,"Kind of a short and simplified version of Grimrock. Biggest difference is that you can't use creative movement in battle.Well, not true. There is a way. If you keep sidestepping a creature, while it is in movement you can land hits without taking the 'fleeing damage' that you receive if you strategically retreat. Few traps that can be easily disarmed. Still have a thief.Reccommend having a paladin, theif, berserker and a mage/elementalist for the party."
76561198011604006,Recommended,492500,28814820,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Saboth,"I'm going to recommend this game, but with caveats.Heroes of Monkey Tavern is a party-based first person view grid dungeon crawler.Graphically, it is decent. Music is good, gameplay is average. There is no discernable story. You select a party of four from various classes and venture into a dungeon. You'll level up, gain loot, figure out some simple puzzles here and there, look for secret doors, etc. It's a very simple game, and it's short. I finished in about 6 hours. When your party levels up, you do not choose stats or abilities for them, they are assigned for you. The loot is not random. You can only assign 1-2 spells at a time to your casters. Your spells are static, and you'll gain them at preset levels. Combat consists of simply clicking a weapon or spell icon over and over for each character as soon as its cooldown is over. Not much strategy at all. However, there is no square dancing in this game, which is a plus.All-in-all, I did have moderate fun with the game, but it's too short and too simple for a hearty recommendation. It feels like a game you might play on a tablet. But it is well done, and it was an enjoyable 6 hours.Graphics: 6Music: 6.5Fun: 6.7Value: 5.5 (I'd recommend it on a sale, $5-$10 range)"
76561197960809647,Recommended,492500,31265615,Posted: 20 April,all,Ralithorn,I pretty much own every dungeon crawler ever made. My addiction started with Dungeon Master on my Atari ST. This game is a lot of fun and a pretty much simplified version of Legend of Grimrock. (Basically you can't strafe in combat) I've played around with all the classes they all are fun. The weapons are varied and the monsters look great. If you like dungeon crawlers I think you should give this one a try.
76561198398234711,Recommended,492500,33148122,Posted: 2 July,all,Catarter,"Heroes of the Monkey Tavern is a good surprise, having played Might & Magic, Lands of Lore, Eye of the Beholder in their time it reminded me of this feeling.I read some people comparing it to Legend of Grimrock, but they should not, it is not the same game at all.Legend of Grimrock is kind of an ""Action dungeon crawler"", with some impossible riddles and very difficult moments.Where Monkey Tavern is nice and simple to play, no food management, no weight management, etc... just exploration and logic mechanics, listening fabulous music.If it is the work of one man as it looks in the forum, good job dude, I hope you'll offer us a HotMT 2 :-)"
76561197985072747,Recommended,492500,25710434,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,FantasyFreak_UK,"Genre - Grid based movement RPGI grew up on Dungeon Master, Ishar, Eye of the Beholder and Bloodwych and have fond memories of these games. I do appreciate the more open worlded RPGs of today but I will still occasionally go back to retro style games. I played through Legend of Grimrock 1,2 and Ruzar recently and enjoyed them all.Okay so this game plays a bit different to other games in the genre. You have a party of characters but can't position them. They all stand in a row of 4. Monster attacks will AOE attempt to hit all of them but damage is concentrated on your melee fighters. Also you can't dance around the monsters to avoid damage as you will take flee damage. Once you get used to the mechanics the combat is quite satisfying.You have bows, magic and the usual melee weapons to use. You can also find various armour pieces that will boost your stats sligtly. You may need to sleep after every fight though especially if lacking a priest class.I managed to solve most of the puzzles with no help. This means that none were too obtuse and the few I couldn't be bothered with were not required to complete the game on normal mode.I have spoken to the devloper and given him feedback and he has been very receptive and not defensive like some. Mainly I think there is an over reliance on the Priest class, although a common issue in most RPGs It hinders the party diversity. Also you get set skills per level up not allowing any customisation.The graphics look on a par with Grimrock and the monsters look cool whilst they attempt to kill you. You can get surrrounded in a few areas, and this should be avoided if possible as these fights rarely go in your favour.For the price I think this games satisfies and look forward to the developers promised updates and hopefully a sequel."
76561198347902713,Recommended,492500,31835134,Posted: 18 May,all,Abracadabarre,"I tested the demo before I bought the game, and I'm glad I did !When you get used to face your enemy without moving during a fight, just like the old school crawlers (forget Legend of Grimrock, it is not the only reference in this world) everything gets instinctive.Sometimes you stop moving to make sure you will listen to the music til the end, some of them are so epic, while others are quiet but still very adapted to your progression.Fights are basics, but entertaining and difficult.Hard to believe that while this game respects all the rules of a good dungeon crawler it still brings unique and epic moments, good job from the devs.Being a fan of the genre I should complain about the dev removing weight, food and craft, but for once it is true that it is relaxing.At the end I think I can only recommend this game, as an introduction to the genre it is a very good one. Though, to me, being a veteran, it was also a nice journey :-)"
,Not Recommended,492500,31142744,Posted: 14 April,all,Khogn,"As a long-time fan of the genre who grew up with games like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder, Captive and Lands of Lore, I was really excited for this game and tried my best to love it. But already half an hour in, I just can't go on playing this and asked for a refund. This is no Legend of Grimrock, sadly.On the bright side, the game's production is surprisingly good with gorgeous graphics, great music, alright lighting and fluid animations. The interface is also rather intuitive and easy on the newcomers, and the menus are clear and well constructed. Hat down to that, it is directly impressive for a budget game. But the good stops right here.Now on to the bad... First of all, the game hurts you really bad if you try to move while in combat. Yes, you read that right: you cannot really allow yourself to move while fighting, which is probably the core gameplay element in any dungeon crawlers. So you must stand there like an idiot, let the monsters strike you again and again while praying that you will have enough health and protection to survive the encounter. Forget strategic fighting, and you will have to look at the boring sleep/rest screen almost each time between two fights. Secondly, the character placement seems to be on a line. Which means that the two weaker guys also are on the front, taking damage as much as the warriors, but able to strike with melee weapons. It does not make sense either on a strategic plane. Moreover, their portraits are on the bottom, totally obscuring the ground right in front of you. The consequence is that both items and traps are really hard or even impossible to see if you are close to them. Worse even: I dropped a weapon on the floor and was not able to pick it up again. There is something about the game's mechanics which seems to be missing or broken. Last but probably least: there is no story except for the fact that you're broke and go dungeon adventuring to earn money.Overall, there is a cruel lack of depth in this game. Variables like lighting, weight, hunger/thirst, multiple spell handling and combination, tiredness etc. are just not present. It is a beautiful, shallow game with an unsatisfying gameplay system. There was a huge potential here, but it is wasted on very surprising and ill-advised design choices. Hopefully there will be a sequel addressing all its negative aspects."
76561197970586906,Recommended,492500,25671384,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Nyast,"Heroes of the Monkey Tavern is a grid-based dungeon crawler similar to Legend of Grimrock 1. It simplifies the formula to the minimum. Let's review it point by point:Technical: 3 out of 5Graphics are decent for a small indy game, but the tilesets feels very ""Grimrockey"". Different textures & stones would have helped to make the game feel more original. I counted 3 tilesets but they all feel like simple reskins. Monsters do look nice and are well animated with feedback when hit. Sounds are okay. The best part however are the musics, which are very fantasy and add a lot to the ambiance. Unfortunately the music gets interrupted each time you go to sleep, and you go to sleep a lot. I didn't notice any performance issues, which is the least I would expect from my rig ( 6700K + 32 GB RAM + Nvidia 1070 GTX ). Loading times and quick saving / reloading felt instant, so good work here.Dungeon Design: 2 out of 5Grid-based dungeon crawlers live or die by their dungeon design. Unfortunately I'd rateMonkeysslightly below than average in that area. The dungeon is completely linear with progression requiring you to find keys to unlock doors, with an occasional boss battle. Layouts are very labyrinthic with a mix of corridors and rooms, but everything is boring and repetitive. There aren't enough props ( like statues, furniture etc.. ) to give rooms their own uniqueness. There are no variations in room styles or dimensions, no rooms with high ceilings etc... For each floor there's a single entrance staircase and a single exit staircase. No exterior areas to visit.Traps & puzzles are also a disappointment and tend to be on the very simplistic style. Some levers, some statues throwing fireballs, pikes moving up & down and that's pretty much it. Forget pitholes making you fall on a level below, pressure plates, teleporters or other stuff you can usually find in other dungeon crawlers: there aren't any here. No navigationnal puzzles either other than finding keys and most traps are simple rooms with a door that locks behind you and a wall that opens to reveal a monster. Clearly the focus wasn't on making exploration of the dungeon a refreshing experience.Some secrets are hidden and loot is pretty gratifying.Combat: 2 out of 5Combat is pretty typical for this genre: you click on the weapon icons in your left & right hands, which can also hold a spell ( that's a maximum of 2 active spells per character ). Combat happens in real-time but to avoid the 2-step dancing fromGrimrock, the developer implemented a damage-on-flee mechanism which forces you to stand still. It kindda works. As an unfortunate consequence range-based weapons, other than bows, are inexistent and even the bows aren't very powerful. There's a nice variety of monsters but they're all unoriginal looking, and they all fight melee which is another disappointment. You won't find archers throwing arrows at you from the other side of a room, you won't ever have to dodge projectiles, none of the monsters are spellcasters; so in terms of tactics, the game is very poor. Most of the time you'll spam-click your weapons with the ocasionnal healing or fireball spell. Fights aren't too difficult for trash mobs, but a few boss fights will require a bit more thought and potions management.Interface and inventory: 3 out of 5Forget hotkeys for combat: those require you to cycle through your characters to attack, which makes it slower than manually clicking on icons with the mouse. Movement is fine though. There's no in-game menu to remap keys, but it can be done when the game is launching by keeping the shift key pressed. Inventory has more than enough space for what the game has to offer, and when taking an item a tooltip shows the stats and differences with the currently equipped item which is welcome. The interface sometimes doesn't feel entirely coherent, like it is impossible to drag & drop an item to the hands on the character portrait, you have to use the hands on the paperdoll in the invenstory instead. During combat, especially when a character has run out of mana, it becomes very easy to misclick and to open the inventory instead which has cost me a few fights.Automap is available but only maps the current tile, not the adjacent tiles, which tends to make rooms have holes especially in the corners. There's no way to write your own annotations on the map.Gameplay: 3 out of 5The game doesn't really feature a story other than pure dungeon crawling. No NPCs to talk to, no gold, no economy, no crafting. Worse, it doesn't feature much in terms of resource management, which is the other cornerstone of a good dungeon crawler. You won't have to find food, drink water, you can sleep for free anywhere ( as long as it's not during a fight ), no items weight or encumbrance.. so you'll only have to manage your hitpoints & mana pool as well as potions.RPG systems are also pretty simple. Your characters level up automatically, you don't get to manually assign skill points and pick new skills or spells. At each level a character, depending on his class, learns a new skill. Unfortunately those new skills are simple attack upgrades or a +1 in an attribute like strength / dexterity / constitution etc.. So you don't really have any class-based specific skills, other than healing spells for priests and attack spells for elementalists.Loot and progression was easily the best part of the game for me. I had fun finding better equipment and seeing my characters become stronger and stronger. Bonuses like +1 strength immediately make a lot of difference to your character's attacks, and a lot of the loot has to be earned by solving a trap or a hostile encounter.My experience was completely bug free. I finished the game in ~5 hours.Conclusion: 3 out of 5Monkeyisn't terribly ambitious, in fact you could say it does the bare minimum in terms of dungeon crawling. It reminds me ofFalls of the Dungeon Guardians, but with real-time combat that prevents 2-steps dancing instead, which I prefer to the MMO-combat style of FOTDG. The game doesn't have a lot of depth, however it is pretty cheap, which makes it a decent quality / price ratio. I wouldn't recommand it at 20-30$ but at 10$ if you are hungry for a new dungeon crawler, you can't really go wrong."
,Recommended,492500,33962021,Posted: 1 August,all,Verran,"I loved this game. I bought it on sale and, after finishing, feel like I should have paid full price. It is a lot like Grimrock, less like Fall of the Dungeon Guardians, but holds true more to the style of Eye of the Beholder (which I loved back in the day). I loved the simplicity of the melee, ranged and magic systems. I loved the traps and puzzles. More than anything, I loved all of the secrets niches, which I found Grimrock and FoDG somewhat lacking (wishing they had more). The equipment/inventory was also enjoyable in its simplicity. I only have two suggestions for a sequel: make resting shorter (or at least a gameplay option to be shorter), and provide a hotkey for resting. Other than that, I really look forward to a sequel if it stays true to this style. Please make another game. And/or, a DLC for this game (another campaign). Thank you!"

My advice, take your time and explore for gear, don't leave a level until you are sure it's cleared, look for hidden rooms and passages via crooked torches and loose brick switches, use the dungeon's evil devices against those chasing you... but these are are basic dungeon crawl rules, have fun!"
76561197983503833,Not Recommended,492500,25838823,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,Zelurs,"Played through the first four levels. It's alright, but nothing remarkable. It has some fundamental flaws that I don't like.First of all it basically forces you to fight at one place, you can't dance around enemies as you get fleeing damage if you do so. This might work coupled with an interesting fight mechanism, but this game doesn't have that. It's just your basic reaction test: push the attack button when your attack is ready.Your charactes are in a line opposed to a grid. This forces you to move your mouse further than in a traditional two by two grid placement and because of that, fast weapons are in disadvantage as you miss those important seconds what you save by using those weapons. Spellcasters can use only two spells at a time and they have to sacrifice their hand slots for them and they even share the cooldowns with each of their spells. This basically means that your utility spells are useless, you just use heals with your healer and your best damage option with other casters. All this combined makes the fights little bit boring. And on top of everything, as your characters don't need any food or water, you can rest after every fight without any disadvantage.Leveling is predefined. You don't get to make any choices as your characters level up. And you don't get to swap your characters in the line, it automatically assign your characters to the imaginary front and back row based on the class. It doesn't tell you which character are in those rows, only way you know that this happens is by reading a random tooltip during sleeping. So the only meaningful choises are made in the beginning by choosing a class and of course what equipment you use with your characters.Level design was a little bit boring. It's your standard labyrinth. It had some furniture in it to evoke some meaning to the design, but mostly it was just boring corridors and rooms. But I've seen worse. Puzzles in the first four levels were pretty basic.Music I liked and couple of the monsters were pretty nice looking.All in all,  I can't really recommend this game to anyone else than the most enthusiastic dungeon crawlers."

,Recommended,492500,29120166,Posted: 8 January,all,dark.planetar,"Interesting old school dungeon crawler with good graphics. I do not believe this to be a clone of  log but a game made by a passionate dungeon crawler fan.There is much atention to details: sound of map writing in real time when revealing close walls, short descriptions on artifacts, sound puzzles.Unique concept to Heroes of the Monkey Tavern is not allowing hit & run tactics on AI, (we all exploit weak AI) you take battle damage if you engage the enemy and leave, meaning that you stand and fight until you or the enemy drops. There are not many enemies so all battles are interesting or on the edge (also a surprise battle on lvl 6 if you like puzzles).The strategy here is to have the right artifacts on characters for maximum efficiency of the party, so you can stand and fight.The manual explains more about different classes and their progression (it should be included with the game?)https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uag6WVkarfQ24nNVR8Gra4NcRKc6DXJ1c3lSPbBi6rk/pubThe replay value it's high. Life and mana restores over time, you can sleep not worring about food.The puzzles and secrets are simple and interesting, not too hard, some you can avoid.The keyboard controls help not waste any time on long battles.It took me about 11 hours to finish this game (i tried to complete all puzzles and open all secret doors.I can play Heroes of the Monkey Tavern again, I do like the diverse character classes to combine and party trough the levels. Maybe I'll start a 4 Elementalists party.I do hope there will be a second game like this maybe Heroes of the Monkey Tavern 2?"
76561198048058172,Recommended,492500,30223055,Posted: 27 February,all,msj1117,"If you're looking for a great 5-7 hour dungeon-crawling romp, look no further. Straightforward questline: lead a band of 4 adventurers to the top of a monster-infested tower to get money so they can continue carousing at the tavern. There are traps, secret doors, and all kinds of treasure waiting for you to find. You can choose from a variety of character classes. Levelling up is automatic in that you don't get to manage skill and spell selection; the game does that for you. Skill/spell advancement is linear for each class so you'll always get the skill or spell corresponding with a character's level.Artwork is fine, but what really shines is the music, which is some of the best I've heard in recent gaming. A lot of the music seems inspired by Howard Shore / The Lord of the Rings soundtrack, which is fine by me. The music and artwork do a great job creating atmosphere.Combat is not turn-based but you can handle everything with your mouse pretty easily. Once a fight is over you can rest and save. Most fights are 1 monster at a time so it isn't like you have to manage several mobs coming at you at once.It's a great game. I highly recommend it and supporting this developer will hopefully encourage him to design more. He's very communicative and has been all over the discussions helping Steam members, so it feels good to purchase a game from a solid guy."

If you are new to dungeon crawlers, you could do far worse than starting with ""Heroes of the Monkey Tavern"". The game is very thin on roleplaying. You don't get to name your characters, portraits are limited, and the characters serve no function but to fight. There is little in the way of story...you enter the tower, work your way to the top , get the treasure, and it's over in approximately six hours. I think the $7.99 asking price is still fair, as it's content is solid and fun. I played on the normal mode, died a few times and had to reload saves. Nothing that was too difficult, the battle mechanics, traps, and puzzles are all adequate for younger players or newbies of the genre. The game is a good stepping stone to more difficult entries in the genre like Grimrock, Might and Magic, and Wizardry. Again, it's a worthy buy...just know you're not getting into a deep RPG experience here. Just a short, fun, basic adventure!"

The game overall is slated in the players favor and is very basic.  You're unable to quick weapon swap, unable to use the whole range of spells quickly, not dancing around the grid map, and many puzzles are straight forward.  The monsters are similarly scaled down to reflect these lack of options and tactics, so only when a boss monster requires a gimmick to defeat will you really face much chance of actually death.Overall I liked it, just don't be expecting too much going in, a few brain teasers and a fun day or two and you'll polish it off.  But if you're a fan of this style of game it's worth a few bucks and nice if you've got a day off."

,Not Recommended,492500,34119266,Posted: 8 August,all,projectmayhem702,"I was really in the mood to get into an oldschool Eye of the Beholder type RPG.  I own Grimlock 1 and 2, and they're great.  Saw this was recommended, and at $10, it seemed like a good deal.  I'll say this: it scratched an itch, but didn't really satisfy long-term.  The RPG elements are super shallow (almost non-existent), the puzzles are incredibly basic switches and hidden button finding, and the enemy design and combat gets boring pretty quick.  I hate to sound so negative, because I can tell it was a noble attempt at a nostalgic style (clearly one which I was looking for as well).  But it simply didn't hold my interest for long.  In combat I spent more time staring at the weapon icons for each character, just clicking on any whose cooldown had ended.  I barely looked up to see what sort of damage it was doing.  You likely won't survive any encounters that involve multiple enemies, If you survive combat, you just rest and heal fully with no risk at all.  I suppose for $10 bucks I can say I was able to sort of enjoy a 2.5 hour experience before getting bored, but I just longed for something more."
,Recommended,492500,29581744,Posted: 30 January,all,ManuTOO,"Ranting Review :Hum, this game feels really unfinished and unpolished. With its simple combat system and level design, it could have been a nice introduction to the square-based FPV dungeon-crawling genre, but unfortunately it lacks some user-friendliness. It has however some simple charm, which makes me regret even more the developer didn't build up more his game.So it could be a buy during a sale. Anyway, if you're not sure, there's a demo allowing to try out the 1st level, which should give you a decent idea of the whole game (ie: there's no important change in the gameplay and in the level design, and to estimate the size of the dungeon, know there's a total of 8 levels), so I'd recommend you to try it out.Pros :- Simple level design, coupled with an automap, so you'll never get lost => easy introduction to the genre- No square-dancing, which is replaced by some healing and a tiny bit of tanking (if you rest the game will show an hint explaining you that the front row is made of the fighters and they will protect the back row which is made of the spell casters, although there's no visual hint for that on screen)- Visually, it's decent, although it seriously lacks some variations in the wall design and a bit of unity overall- Puzzles are simple enough- Traps are usually well thoughts without being too painful nor dangerousCons (some might be Pros depending of your tastes, and vice-versa! ;-) ) :- Combat system is mostly a basic whack-a-mole without challenge, which means we spend the combat staring at the character toolbar to click as soon as possible on their weapons or spells when they're out of cooldown- In Hard mode, most combats will end with your mage and sometimes your Priest without mana anymore, which will force you to rest, which runs a little animation for 20 seconds where you cannot do anything => mood breaker, loss of real-life time- The mage gets its best spell very early and thus all the spells you get after feel nearly useless- The monk hand icons look almost same when they are ready and on cooldown ; for a whack-a-mole game, it's really penalizing ; other icons with weapons look too same as well, but a bit less, so it's almost ok- Enemies don't have an HP bar so it's a guesswork to decide to use potions or not when a combat lasts longer than usually- Can be beaten in 6 hours without speeding ; for a $10 game, that's just not enough- The stone opening most secret passages is really hard to notice because it doesn't have a special shape, but instead it's just a bit more protuberant than other stones, and thus when seeing it from the front it just gets a very faint outline (so it's actually easier to see it from the side)- Leveling brings 0 choice : you get extra abilities or your attributes raise in a predetermined sequence- You get abilities when leveling up, but there's no description about what they do, so you just have to guess their effect >_<- You can only affect 2 spells maximum to your priest and in such case you lose your weapon and thus can't attack- Level design is globally pretty basic and almost nothing is memorable- Can't manipulate the items in the 3D world, so there's no puzzle involving items- No teleporter nor pressure plate- There's no story except the short intro and the mega-mini-end :)  (it's not really penalizing in this genre, though)- Fountains resurrect your dead party members, but the game doesn't explain you that- Can't redefine the keys in-game ; it can be only done from the launcher"

,Recommended,492500,34008137,Posted: 3 August,all,GrD« Igni,"Pretty decent game for the price. It's legend of grimrock light and does it pretty damn well. It only takes about 4 hours to complete the game on normal and has a straightforward battle system. There are a lot of things hidden on walls so being aware of your surroundings helps a lot. A very basic and quick game which has a surprising amount of challenge outside of combat.Comparatively to other games at $5 on sale, it's below their quality. For a game that opens with a story, it's lacking after the initial opening."

I actually didn't like the 90's games of this type that much. Somehow this game breaks a bit loose of the things I disliked about those older games.For this price, the game is quite good. I miss a little bit more tactics in the fights, but you can get that in another game like this that costs 10 credits more.This game actually has something simplistic yet very fun in it. The graphics are VERY nice, even whilst being repetitive (typical of this genre). Here and there, there are some funny jokes, and there is one level (haven't finished yet) that really creeps you out."

However when you level-up those stats are predetermined/allocated as are the new skills/spells learnt.Story is non existant, the music is actually quite good/fitting with the game. The dungeon tilesets are also good as are the monster animations. Sound is also of decent quality and fits right in.I completed the game in all 3 difficulty modes to get 100% achievements as was easy to attain.So to summarise, I would give it a 7.5/10, get on sale where possible and ""Get bashing those heads""Regards,"

Not quite up to their level, but very enjoyable. They removed a lot of burdomsome detail that is really not a lot of fun, like food and arrow storing. You never need to eat, and if  you have a bow, you can shoot arrows. The levels were well made, all dungeon crawling and puzzlesA hint if you are just starting out: This is not like other games like this, you generally do not run around while fighting. Your group will take 15 HP damage every time you move away from an adjacent enemy, a coward penalty I guess. Took me a while to realize this, I thought it was incredibly hard to win a fight at first.For $10 it is a good deal if you like this type of game. About 10 hours to play through, do not think their is much replay value though.Really need a rogue on the team if you want to find hidden rooms, many of the hidden buttons would be nearly impossible to find otherwise."

Not to mention you should have the option to flee if necessary.First time I've ever played this type of game where none of that is viable and all you're ""supposed"" to do is spam from a single position.So for that reason alone I can't recommend this title for fans of the genre."
