So let's start withthe pros.- Simple Menu Layout- Different Language options- Different types of campaigns- 3 Types of Tutorials- Good Controls- Nice resource gathering mechanics- Good Audio (Sometimes)- Game may take a while to finish- Plenty of buildings to build- Tells me enough Info to do something succesfully- I Found myself always active and doing somethingAnd now the cons...- Audio gets repetitive over time- Graphics aren't great- Im game tab (Left Side) takes up quarter of my screen- Unable to remove dead trees or other debris, therefore Ihad some building limitations- The NPC's faces freak me out- Unable to move buildings- Unable to upgrade buildings- Anticlimactic fightingSo with the Pros and Cons said, these are the stats to summarize the game:- Story = 7/10- Graphics = 5/10- Cinematics = 5/10- Music/Audio = 6/10- Content = 7/10- Controls = 7/10- Gameplay = 7/10- Price = 9/10All out of 80 = 53/80. Summarize = 6.6/10So to anyone who intends on buying it, go ahead, The DarkLegions is a good game for $1.45, it could use quite a lotof changes and tweaks, but nevertheless this is still agame I would recommend playing, and so overall, The DarkLegions is a good game...Here is the Video Link =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-T7qsYAxwo"

This game is old, it takes up 230 mb (:O) and is maninly about speed. What I have noticed the AI depends on the color of said AI. I noticed 3 colors and how they play. Red is normal, you can beat them just by your own knowledge of this game (Campange Lvl. 4 completed). White is a tech focused, this means they reseach their techs a lot fast then any other color. The last color is Black who are maninly manpower and the hardest of the colors. This difference is easily seen on Easy and Normal settings.There are more colors but I can't remember what each do. For a bit of fun, use (ctrl, shift, m) to open the consle, type in eye of the beholder to remove fog of war (FOW). You can also use gimme fuel, gimme fire for 10,000 of each resource.I love this game but it doesn't hold up expect for the price, worth it!(Extra: I have spent $40 on this game do to rebuys and new computers and the game was NOT $2, consider you guys lucky :P)"
,Recommended,492530,28148921,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,TLOG,"BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I was looking at the medieval games on steam because that interests me.  I stumbled across this game.  I was surprised at the price.  Luckily i had $3.00 on my account.  I watched the trailer and immediately bought it.  If you like medieval games where you build and create and army, this game is perfect for you.  There is no cons (at least for me).  Best $2.00 I've ever spent.  I'm not exaggerating.  I highly recommend this game.  P.S If you see people saying ""the graphics suck.  They could definitely be better!""  Or  ""the fonts suck"" DO NOT listen to them.  This game was made in 2004.  DON'T listen to those reviews.  Base them off of mine or people that aren't idiots and don't say dumb things when not looking at the release date of the game.  Thank you for reading my review!"

(Played this game on a pirate disc.) The game crashes every 15 minutes, and I very much wanted to play. Now I have it finally decided to buy something, all there seems to be normal, in general, cool game, my favorite strategy game in the time of 2000-2011. I recommend the game!"
,Recommended,492530,25721789,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,Donald der Führer,"This game is the manchild of Age of Empires and Warcraft 3.It doesn't have the macro capability of a Blizzard game, but it does have all the quirks. Undead, giants, walls of fire. You could also go the route of heavy knights and mounted units. My personal favorite is the crossbow and catapults(fire, fire everywhere).The rp value is here in the diversity of it's tech tree.If you play on a river map you can use the buildings and their upgrades to control major mining grounds and use the money to fuel magic spells from dark priests.If you're in an island map you can all your wood on galleys and secure the wood of other players trying to create a balanced army AND TAKE THEIR GOLD TOO!There are so many possibilities it will leave you wondering how you die so fast on the ""easy"" setting from the computers random cheese.tl;dr This game is awesome and makes it easy to understand how bad you are at it. Worth my $1.50.Pro tip: I only every play in the Orange team as ""the Donald."""

,Recommended,492530,34263810,Posted: 15 August,all,Djo_madoto,"Probably the best medival Strategy game for it's time (2004). This newer version contains some bonus stuff in the Story Campaign which were hinted in the credits. Also a lot of game crashing bugs have been fixed, but there are still some left. Awesome 20+ hrs story (or mby even more if you take your time), a few challenging bonus missions (if you are a new player, it's advised to complete the Story mode first). If only this game gets all of it's bugs fixed and also gets multiplayer in the future it will be the best medival Strategy game ever in my opinion! :)"
76561198081540459,Recommended,492530,26194127,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Broly,"A AMAZING GAMEapoligies for any bolded words and long review but it is worth reading if you are unsure to get this game.THIS game is A MUST have DONT let the price deceive you it is amazing and better than most RTS games old and new modern ones. It delivers more replay value and content far more than 90% rts games especially since it is only 2$. A 2$ game that has more replay value and content than now a days exoensive rts games?! it is amazing!I am a new comer to old RTS games ive spent my years playing new ones like crusader, stronghold,total war series such as rome 2, total warhammer, etc. I have never tried out any of the old RTS games like this, a new experience and i was thinking it would just be a cheap not great game but i was BADLY MISTAKEN. In my opinion this has to be my favorite RTS game, i like it more than all the RTS ive listed above and played. I wasnt sure what to expect for a 2$ RTS game but i saw some good ratings and decided since it is cheap and good ratings why not play it. I am extremely glad i did, you have to remember this is a older game so it wont have amazing graphics or all the stuff you see in the new RTS games.It actually has pretty good graphics, sound, troops, hundreds of hours of fun replay value, amazing gameplay, mechanics, easy to learn, cool looking troops/buildings/walls, difficult to master especially facing AI on harder difficulties. It has in my opinion the best thing that makes a RTS good which is a SKIRMISH MODE AND ABLE TO BUILD CASTLES OF WHATEVER CREATIVE designs you can think of! Dark legions is similar to crusader but very different and better, it has small/medium/large maps and it can have battles up to 8 players! im not sure what the limit is to how many troops you can have but from what ive played you can have some huge massive armies.For me the value of this game is easily worth what now a days RTS games are sold for and even for 2$ it has SO much content/maps/options/campaigns and many other great things. I can name a ton of games that are far more expensive but dont have even a fraction of this games content and replay value. You can spend hundreds of hours and it will still be so much fun. The AI are unpredictable and when you think you have the advantage it can flip on you. In conclusion every fan of RTS needs to get this game, i can promise you for its price it is immensely better than you think and better than most now a days RTS games. Also there seems to be no lag at all and that is great since most big rts games have that issue so another bonus. Thank you for your time and i hope you get this wonderful game."

76561198057013133,Recommended,492530,24961940,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Semperfi0817,"Absolutely love this style of game. Nobody does anything like AOE, Banished, the original warcraft anymore. This is true RTS old school. For those who are looking at this game and whining about the grapics. Read up on the Dev and understand he created this game just for himself  way back in the day, so for that day and age these graphics hold up very well considering we have had how many OS upgrades? It plays on all windows versions from what I can tell. You can't even say that about half the games released by larger companies today. This game is perfect for those like me who want to take time and harvest resources, and plan where you want to place your buildings and has a single player campaign. I am so sick of all the multi-player games with time limits to complete this task or that. I deal with time limit projects and multi-people in my real job. Why the heck do game makers think I want more of that at home. This is the simple go at your own pace, produce, build, upgrade and kick some butt. To the developer, thank you for making your personal little project from yester-year available."

,Recommended,492530,24261758,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Izunundara,"This is basically Age of WarHold. Age of Empires sound effects and techs set on a Warcraft HUD with some very Stronghold-y sounds and feel. Yet I like it, strangely enough. This is what Warcraft 2 would have been if it had appeared a little later, this is Warcraft 2.5.To the Devs:-Please clean up the font, it's horrible.-Get someone who speaks native English to look over your text. Hell, I'll do the HUD stuff for you if you need it.-ADD A FORCE ATTACK BUTTON THAT DOUBLES AS ATTACK MOVE.-Monks should not be spammable to make your units immortal. Add a way to counteract this."

This game wants so bad to be Warcraft 3 it isn't funny. Well, it kind of is for a few minutes, but the bland colors and awful pathing and controls make this game just want you to play a better RTS. Don't let the 2$ price tag fool you, it isn't really worth it. The wonky animations and graphics work for Warcraft, but just make this game look ugly."
