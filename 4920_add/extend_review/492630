Bear With Me is an amazing title with slick writing, fun voice acting, and some of the best humor ever in a game. Playing the first chapter, I was imersed in the story, and actually caught up between the wacky comedy, and deep story coming too.  I love this game. This game is truly worth Adventure, Point and Click fans library!  A fun idea of stuffed animal and a young girl going on a dark mystery, with dark elements, and good laughs. I HIGHLY recommend this one, and it's worth your time!Get it! Download it!  You must play this one!10/10"
,Recommended,492630,25166640,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,angelwolfchild,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a clawsome game that is impawsible to furget. Having a charming yet grizzly atmosphere that you won’t find too polarizing, I just couldn’t bear to put it down.Sorry, I’ll stop the bear puns now.Promise.Ahem, so ‘Bear with Me’ is an episodic point and click game with a heavy noir detective theme. But you know that from reading the description, and really if you’re interested by that idea then you’re probably going to enjoy this game. Yet if you’re still a bit sceptical then let me assure you, it is worth the time to go through.Firstly, the thing that strikes me the most about this game is how it takes itself quite seriously yet doesn’t at the same time. If you take out a few of the jokes and references to toys and I would believe this could be a legit film-noir creation, and there’s some very dark and disturbing aspects to this game. The first cutscene you see (which turns out to be a nightmare) looks like something out of a horror game, not to mention the fact that this game deals with themes like crime, alcohol and death (all with a toy-based overtone but it’s still very serious) as well as a very creepy-looking antagonist. Yet amidst all this is a very large helping of puns, quirky little comments from our two main characters and the references… good lord the references are beautiful! Particularly that fantasy book in the bedroom, I think that was a very well placed joke. It is a funny game overall, at least one of these jokes is bound to get a laugh out of you.All of this works because there is a lot of personality to the game. I really need to give credit to the writers, between the typical tropes of noir detective fiction and the great self-referential comments they created some very endearing and funny characters that you want to spend more time with. Amber, the little girl, is a very loveable child with quite a sharp wit about her while Ted E Bear (I swear that’s not another pun that’s his actual name) pulls off the typical gruff private eye while still having a lot of heart in his actions. Some of the best moments of this game come from just clicking on stuff to hear what these two have to say. With this only being the first episode there aren’t many other characters we meet, yet each one feels natural to the story and are a pleasure to be around, all complemented by a lovely art style that seems to blend the adult nature of the noir style with the more innocent setting of this little girl’s house and her toys. There isn’t much music to speak of, though when it does appear it’s used effectively to build up atmosphere however it’s needed (also that title screen music… it’s really really creepy and I can’t get it out of my head).This game also surprised me with how emotionally attached I became to all of these people, it reminded me a bit of Fran Bow in that way although this game is certainly not as psychologically disturbing as that one. Yet. It also caused me a bit of heartache. I really don’t want to spoil anything as this game is not only quite short but it’s best experienced blind, so apologies for being really vague, but there’s a certain section of ‘Bear with Me’ that caught me off guard and genuinely shocked me when I first played the game. At first I was expecting it to be a cutscene due to the sudden shift away from our leads, but no this was something you can play through, resulting in a significant choice… a choice I didn’t realise was there until the second playthrough. Still feeling very guilty about it.So just to wrap things up, I would highly recommend this to any fans of Point and Click games, and just to anyone who loves games with personality and heart. Of course this is still just episode 1 and trust me, I am eagerly awaiting the next episode with bated breath so I can find out more about the story (if anyone has any theories so far please do let me know, I’m curious to see people’s ideas). Yet for what we have, I’m thoroughly impressed by what Exordium Games have produced, so everyone go and enjoy it!Now the wait for episode 2 begins, hopefully it won’t become too unbearable."
,Recommended,492630,32861382,Posted: 27 June,all,sparky_buzzsaw,"(Review is for the first two episodes)Bear With Me, a traditional point-and-click adventure game, stands out for its terrific, inventive world. Blending a noir-like atmosphere and dialogue with the interactions between a child and her anthropomorphic friends (who may or may not be part of her vivid imagination, an element I really liked) leads to some rich slices of a world.The game doesn't quite take full advantage of that in its first episode, keeping the focus narrowed to the child's house, but once the game has its legs under it in the second episode, the game starts to explore the much more intriguing Paper City, as well as introducing some teasers for what's to come.The humor can be hit and miss, but I largely like it. Even the referential humor is mostly cute and inoffensive, which isn't something I'd normally say about jokes like that.The machanics are solid - you pick stuff up, you combine said stuff with other stuff, and you progress a bit in the story. This is typical adventure fare, but it recognizes the strengths of the genre and doesn't try to stray from them, creating a smart, simple UI and keeping the focus squarely where it needs to be - the characters and the setting. I do wish the hint system - disguised as conversations you have with your teddy bear detective pal - wasn't quite so obtuse at times. Giving vague, unhelpful comments about where the characters need to eventually head to doesn't help me figure out that I've somehow missed a very tiny grate in an environment.Overall, Bear With Me is a phenomenal start to an adventure series, one I look forward to finishing once the future episodes are released. It should be checked out by any fans of the genre."

Quite cartoon like in appearance.The soundtrack was great, the voice acting was also very good & also quite amusing at times.The gameplay was your usual Point &Click gameplay, with inventory items to combine & puzzles to solve using the inventory items. As well as some dialogue with options to choose.It is quite short (there's an Achevo for finishing it in under 1hr), but considering i got it on sale for $2.50, i'm happy with the value for money."

The whole game seems to revolve around amber acting out fantasies that a young child like her would. Most of the characters in the game are stuffed animals or toys. and the story remains in the house. So it seems that the game is all in her head which gives it an interesting viewpoint.Music/Sound 8/10 - The music and sound were very good. The voices of the characters were clear and and easily understood.Overall - Overall i really enjoyed the game and look forward for the next episode.

It is kinda short on gameplay time, but it is still full of character, silly references and fourth-wall breaking humor. I really like its crisp black and white artstyle and its witty written dialogue and characters. Ted E. Bear is fantastically voiced and sounded indeed as if ripped right out of an old noir crime movie, while ten years old Amber sounds a bit...too old. Though this is just a minor nitpick and doesn't take away from the game's overall quality.Since this is an episodic game, the story isn't really that developed yet, though the groundwork and mystery is laid out just fine for further episodes. I'm looking forward for more, and hopefully soon."

It's fun, Had some giggles playing this game.The only thing I'm disappointed about : the episode is quite short (2 hours max, if you want to finish 100% of the episode), and I'm a little frustrated to have to wait for the next one (because I will wait for it to be on sale)After finishing episode 2 : kinda forgot the double-click to move faster... so just putting it here for people that missed it.

Tl;dr :This is a short, boring game.The trailer looked great. The gameplay trailer looked fun! Sadly Bear With Me turned out to be a boring pixel hunter. To make matters worse it’s really, really, short. Painfully short considering it’s price. $4.99 of point and click fun should feel like an experience, not a paid half demo.A half demo really?Yep, Bear With Me feels like the first half of a Kickstarter Demo for a game that could be. I get the feeling that this was supposed to be a free intro chapter and maybe devs decided at the last minute to charge for it. Long story short, nothing of interest happens in this first episode.Nothing.You meet some of the main characters, hear some plot, find some hidden objects and make it to the attic and then BAM its over and you watching the credits in disbelief.  How this game is getting so many good reviews on Steam is totally beyond me. I found myself stuck for a long while trying to open something with no clear direction at all. When I finally gave up and tried every random thing in my inventory to open it, a small nail did the job. It was such a stupid answer the game called itself out for lazy writing.Really?While the voice acting was alright, I found myself getting more and more annoyed at hearing the same lines over and over again. Especially Milly’s annoyance with me for not knowing what to do next. This leads to a huge problem with Bear With Me, no story/progress journal. If you take a break from this game and forget it’s forgettable tale and come back to it you are kinda screwed if you were in the middle of looking for something. You have no way to keep track of what your objectives are and what you accomplished. I cannot believe this is missing.Sigh.I want to love Bear With Me. Heck, I’d be OK with liking it and having honest hope for it. But the truth is Bear With Me feels like a short wasted opportunity. That said this is just the first chapter. Granted it’s a pitifully small chapter, but maybe, just maybe, it might get better from here. Then comes two important questions:Is this game worth your time and five dollars?I hate to sound like a jerk, but no. I was annoyed through most of it thanks to the unclear gathering puzzles and lack of objective tracking system. The promise of a good, engrossing introduction to this world story kept me on the hook, but ultimately let me down. That being said, I cannot recommend this game to you. I played through it twice while making different choices hoping for a better experience, but I didn’t get one.Will I buy the next episode?Kinda doubtful. Maybe, just maybe if I am lucky enough to be flush with money I might. But really for what I got out of this initial experience it doesn’t seem worth it. Also since most of the Steam reviews for this game are totally glowing, I get the feeling that it will end up as more of the disappointing same.I hate writing bad reviews for games I wanna love, but what you just read is it. I’ll follow this game on Steam and hope for updates that make me hopeful for the sequel. Lets see what happens.AVOID THIS."

You shouldn't expect this game to be serious.Bear With Me is a linear adventure game of classic style, that takes you on a voyage to the world of little Amber and her pet friends. You can play it casually, as this game lets you stop and save any time you wish. But I think most of you will play it through, as it unfolds a very unique charm. Each and every item has an extensive description, that is given either by Amber or by Ted E. Bear. While Amber comments rather naive, the bear's comments are always dark and sarcastic. Just like some snoop story by Dashiel Hammett or such.Most puzzles are well balanced; only at the end of this first episode you have to search for two or three items that are only a few pixels wide. I hope this will be better adjusted in the episodes to follow.I hope there will be a season pass soon; in the meantime I encourage you all to buy and play Episode 1 of this classic (and classy) adventure game."

The dialogue-to-puzzle ratio is way off, by the end of it I was just rapid fire clicking through the text to get it done with. Much of it does not contribute to the story. The problem is, when you click to skip the voice acting, the characters will still act out their movements, leading to a lot of moments where the game feels like it's breaking.I also noticed a lot of spelling and grammar errors. The voice acting is pretty flat as well.Overall, you get what you pay for, I guess. This game shows promise, but it's not there yet."

Comic-style but well-drawn graphics really stand out.We have yet to see the full plot in upcoming episodes, but so far it seems like we have a simple but good scenario.So overall, this is a brand new p&c adventure that will be welcomed by fans of the style as well as people who like detective stories and/or teddy bears.Pros:- Point & click game mechanics done well- Great humour- Cute 2d graphic style- Characters & voice actingCons:- Ted's ""diary"" felt a bit too long at times, even though I greatly enjoyed it overall- Single walking speed.

You play a ten year old girl having an imaginery adventure with your teddy bear completely in the style of film noir. But premise and execution are two different things. There is too much stuff to just look at. Most everything is irrelevant to the story which you quickly forget. Lots of humor using pop culture out of game references which quickly break both the story and the 4th wall and any semblence of actual humor. Talking to characters is long and tedious. Too much film noir dialogue we've heard a million times that doesn't really go anywhere. As a game itself it is servicable as a point and click adventure except for two things. It is SO clunky choosing things from your inventory and using them on something else in the room. Also when you want to use certain things or go to the next room it is SO SLOW in making the characters walk there. It has this annoying habit of having one character go there and complete the journey and THEN it lets the other one move so it takes twice as long. After not that long I would just click through every bit of dialogue and not listen to it (especially descriptions of things). I also just looked for the ONE thing in each room that would let me USE it instead of just looking at it. That is the thing I take to use in another room. Way too few puzzles. Way too little to do. And really the out of place stuff is not funny in this dreary tedious (and heard too many times ) story.Sad because as I said cute premise. Oh yeah...this is episode ONE???

However they do go all out with the noir, curse words and all (Nothing too intense, just some (Beaver walls) and other curse words. Nothing to stop anyone from getting the game though.There are points where I get sucked into the noir of the story. The heavy dialog, the black and white colors.

I'll be talking about what I think about the game after playing the episode and you may see an evolution in my opinion as longer the review gets.Episode 1: I didn't realise until way later that this game was going to be divided in episodes, if I knew this earlier I would probably buy the full game once it was released, but I couldn't resist buying episode 1 because of a sale. The first episode has given me loads of good impressions. I knew from before that the game was going to be in black and white but it didn't bother me at all. It gave a special sort of scenery that fit with the story very well. The graphics look hand-drawn and it gives an extra sort of feeling to it, not negatively of course. The story is very confusing at first but at the end of the episode it was slowly evolving into the full story, not as catchy as some stories are but I kept playing anyway. Maybe it was because of the good execution of the game. It has good interactions, they really considered that you should be able to interact with every object. The voice of the bear is amazing, I do not know how to describe it but I hope he gets a lot of  lines next episodes. His voice is not the typical cutie bear voice but a very deep voice, reminded me of the stereotypical voice of a war veteran of some sort. The cutscenes are a nice addition, it gives you a sort of visual what you have accomplished the past 'chapter', but not a necessary one. The game category is not really clear to me, it has good humour but it tries to be as scary as possible. Honestly both of these think worked out. The humour is rare to find in this game but with effort you'll get a good laugh. The scary part is also well executed, when you play this for the first time you really don't expect these random scary moments."

Beyond that, it’s not a particularly deep story, but that’s hard to judge considering how short the episode is.I'll start with the weakest point in Bear with Me, the game play. It's pretty lacking, not much in the way of puzzles. More like go there, get that, combine these 2 things and done. It's just very simple, to the point where if you’re looking for a challenge, you might want to wait for the rest of the series.However, there's certainly some cleverness to the game, tone and setting deserves a good bit of credit.  It appears to be a child game within a game, but it also composes a psychological edge to it.   Bear with Me shares a good bit of similarity with Anna’s Quest (bear partner in a “Play” like setting) with just a dash of Fran Bow(and I mean just a dash). It’s an interesting concept so far. The developers seemed to have enough room to maintain the games levity or take a darker path.The humor is okay, the slow pace of the game means jokes aren’t overwhelming, but when some fall flat it is really noticeably. The issue is, since this is a noir, the characters are hard boiled, but when they crack a joke, it comes off as breaking the 4th wall every time. That said, there is a lot of care placed in the game to make the humor hit home for gamers.I still recommend this game for point and click enthusiast, it has its issues, but I think it’s shown enough potential to give a thumbs up.  It would be a much easier sell if the whole game was completed first. If you’re not sold on the game thus far, maybe you should wait for more episodes to be released."

There is nothing new or groundbreaking as far as gameplay goes, it's your typical point and click adventure game where you collect everything you find and use/combine them to advance the story. But it's the way the story is told and perceived from the player that make the experience so much fun. You play as a 10 year old girl looking for her little brother (because little brothers are always getting themself into trouble :P ) and the story plays on this. Subtle hints throughout the game alude to what the overall plot and setting may actually be, including Amber seeking the aid of her former partner Ted.E.Bear, a retired private detective who helps Amber with her quest to find her lost brother. There are several in game jokes poking fun at itself as well as other video games and films, and is constantly breaking the fourth wall with the player.

However, I feel I must voice it.The game has a lot of good going for it. The Noir/Fantasy/Horror is actually pretty exciting and so is the characterisation. This said, game falls short in two areas.Firstly, it has all of the problems that point and click adventures usually have. With counter-intuitive puzzles and the poor pacing that comes with that. This is magnified when the protagonist whinges, ""Are you are you even trying?"" Over and over, when the only way to find the answer to some of the 'puzzles' is to place everything you have in your inventory on everything in the environment, until it solves itself.This leads to the worst crime of the game.... The protagonist is an absolute prat... Some of the nonsense that comes out of her mouth could only be rational if she had just returned from her monthly meeting at the Wear a Running Blender as a Hat Club.This saddens me... The scenes where she isn't in the game are good; properly good. I'd happily play 5 episodes of the game as Ted, without her. But her voice and actions make me grind my teeth.So to conclude: Cool idea... What the hell happened with the execution?"

The amount of Stuff to do was miniscule and either very obvious or very unintuitive.Although the Artstyle is alright the assets and animation are just not very good. Worst example was the antagonist who just looked goofy and out of place instead of terrifying.The Dialogue is just ok. Mostly I was a bit disappointed about Mr bear because he is very monotone (I know it´s somewhat intended but he sounds like he doesn´t give a crap about anything which makes it hard to relate). Also no hat.I do not recommend this game. It either needs better quality or a much longer runtime.I hope with the second episode something about that changes but before I consider buying it I will have a look at the reviews.

It follows the story of 10-year old Amber Ashfield, as she attempts to find her missing brother Flint who has seemingly disappeared. Or has he been kidnapped? It's not completely ceratin, but with a case this complicated, she must enlist the help of the veteran, supposedly retired private detective Ted E. Bear (her...um...teddy bear).The first episode proved a highly promising start to this new series. Filled with self-aware humour and plentiful fourth wall breaking, it has a very humourous and not-at-all serious tone to the narrative. Somtimes self-aware comedy can be over-bearing and obnoxious, but the writers use it sparingly - it only surfaces in relevant situations. The film-noir style was also a very fitting touch, reminisant of The Maltese Falcon or Chinatown, with the flawed (often drunkard) private detective near retirement, pulled back into work for one last case that proves the trickiest yet. Oh, and Amber's the femme fatale. Maybe in a future episode they could get in a Blade Runner reference? Gameplay is the usual point-and-click style; moving around the environment, picking up clues and objects which can be crafted to produce tools to progress through the area. It's nothing particulalry innovative, but the writing is so sharp, and the black-and-white 2-D environments so atmospheric, that it didn't really bother me. The original music was excellent as well in solidifying that film-noir aura.Overall, the first episode was very fun, and the series as a whole offers a lot of promise. For the price, I'd say it's more than worth a look-in. I am definitely awaiting the future episodes to see how the mystery develops!"

We find out that such objects are irrelevant because for every object there's between 1 to 4 lines of voice-acted descriptions telling the player in 4th-wall-breaking puns that these objects are irrelevant and we can't use them in any way.If only all that effort would have gone towards story progression instead of story-irrelevant immersion-breaking punnery, I would by now maybe have known enough story to care about the undercooled protagonist and her house without any family in the middle of the night that doesn't seem to worry her at all.The only save for a story where so little happens would be that it turns out to be a big social critique piece against medicating kids with Ritalin.

Ever since Westwood Studios 1997 Blade Runner on PC, I was hooked on games that allowed for more of a thinker to figure out solutions rather than button mashing.Bear with me is silly, well animated, fluid running, & a long adventure that will definitely be money well spent. It was a little on the chatty side for me at times, where LONG dialogue coversations & sometimes a lack of direction towards goals made it 10% frustrating. Other than that, I highly recommend the game & think it is a very well done adventure game."

My favorite genre for many years now is the genre of 3rd person point and click adventure. I just love the different settings and ideas you come across over the years and when I thought I've seen everything, the genre always is good for a nice surprise.This one isn't a (nice) surprise. Why not? The grafics feel really good. There are lot of details, there are lots of objects you can look at or use. The story sounds interesting and builds up some tension; at least it tries to... But! The game began to loose me with the dialogues that were too long (and mainly boring) in the beginning. Then: the puzzles, they aren't too hard; but they are not really intuitive. And I find it quite annoying that you have to hold the mouse button, when you select something from the inventory until you bring it to the object you want to use it on. The characters move very, very slow. You can't leave a room fast with double-click. So you have to watch your main character walking a lot (walking in slow motion that is). And that's where my fun endend. I want to play a game fluently. I don't want to try different solutions, when the character has to walk around in the room a lot and moves that slow; and most of the time - after having clicked and holding the mouse button to use something from the inventory with something on the screen - you have to read or hear: ""I don't think so"" or something similiar. That killed my fun. I played it for some time. Then I took a break; today I wanted to try again. But after a few minutes I decided that the experience doesn't feel good in any way and so I deleted the local content. And I probably won't ever play it again.One other reason is, this ""game"" is only Episode I. So you have a lot of story packed into this first chapter, you get to know a lot about the background. And, then this Episode ends. And now of course you should want to buy the other chapters, because all the things you heard about, that kept you playing, you didn't see in Episode 1.After all, mainly the Daedalic Games have raised a very high standard; and because of that some OK games just can't hold up with that.Some years ago, I often played AGS-games; in a time when nearly all were freeware. Then it started that more and more of them costed money. But the ones that costed money really were very good; at least the price was related to the product. Bear with me in my opinion would have been an OK game for 1-3 Euros if the story ended with it. Like it is, it is a try to suck money out of your pocket with upcoming Episodes. But, I think this doesn't work well because Episode I isn't very enjoyable to play.What I forgot to mention: The main character is a horrible person. It comments everything in such a arrogant and ill-tempered manner, you are happy if you don't have to listen to this girl ever again!"

Occasionally you'll come across an obstacle, but they're often solved the same way you'd solve them in the real world. Room too dark? Get a torch. Torch not working? Find batteries. Even when the solution isn't quite the same as it would be in the real world, it rarely has you scratching your head. The first 'puzzle' involves having to fix a broken magnifying glass and you only have to walk a couple of metres and click a few times before you find a pair of glasses, a knife, and some glue.For me, none of this is a problem as I don't mind a game that lets my brain have a rest while it tells me a story - provided the story is good - and while the plot of this game doesn't advance particularly quickly, and we don't know quite as much by the end as I'd hoped, it was certainly compelling enough to keep me playing until the end (and enough that I now wanna know when the story's gonna continue). So if you're a hardcore point & click purist you'll probably find this game offensive. But if not, it's worth a try, especially for its reasonably low price."

While the premise might sound childish, this game is in no way a children's game.  There's some mild swearing, as well as (without giving a full spoiler) the potential for something unpleasant to happen to one of the characters.  I also think there may be some more serious themes brought in later that are hinted at in this game.  (Again, trying to avoid spoilers.)The controls were easy to figure out-- the standard ""point, click, drag"" format used in other games of this type.The dialogue made me laugh out loud several times, and the overall idea of a teddy bear as a hardboiled detective is a pretty interesting one.  There are also a lot of great geek references and shoutouts.I liked the noir look to the game and definitely got a kick out of being rewarded for thoroughly examining every item.My one issue with the game is that it was on the short side; I was able to complete a full playthrough of the first installment in one sitting (92 minutes), and that was with backtracking and watching cutscenes.  Episode two, likewise, was a bit on the short side; it did have more choices involved, as well as more exploration.Despite the brevity of the installments so far, I would definitely like to see more chapters/episodes released for this game."

This review touches upon the first part which had been released at the time of writing.In the game of which the gameplay is very traditional to its genre, you play as Amber, a 10-year-old girl, whose brother has suddenly gone missing. To find his brother, Amber needs to recruit a retired investigator and her old buddy, Ted. E. Bear. The game features cartoony graphics mixed in with noir elements and is almost entirely portrayed in black and white, with the exception of red in relation to the villain of the story. It's description-heavy with the characters having a lot to say about almost any object on screen.The first part clocks in at a little under two hours, and the puzzles themselves thankfully aren't obscure like they can get in some of the games of this genre. In fact, they're mostly on the easy side, with the player most likely already figuring out what to do only as the problem is presenting itself. For me, there was only little pixel-hunting involved, a problem also often expected with this style of gameplay.The voice acting is generally pretty good. In a way, it's one of the highlights of this game. When it doesn't quite work, it's more of a writing problem than that of acting itself. We'll get back on that.As for what needs work in my opinion, well... Let's start with the music. Or the fact that there is almost none.In Bear's room, there's a pleasant jazz tune playing on a gramophone (or a record player, as I seem to recall the game calling it). In every other area of the game, there is no music at all. I see no reason to not have music like that playing throughout the game, especially to reinforce the noir atmosphere the developers seemed to want to go for.Music does so much to the atmosphere in any game, and once you make key stylistic choices for your game, you should hold on to them with each element to reinforce the integrity. Have some more smoky jazz playing in the background and there you go! As it stands however, you mostly get noises of the storm raging outside, which isn't too bad - it's a bit of a writing trope, but isn't that the point?Which brings us to the final point of my review, as well as my biggest gripe with this game - the writing.The writer seems to think that jokes breaking the fourth wall are always funny. Even if they are told all the time. As in nearly ten times in the span of two rooms. You're wired to look at everything in games like these, and the game ""rewards"" you with another bad joke that breaks the fourth wall.Here's an example: after inspecting an object, Bear starts reading a bracketed text about the characters moving away from said object, out loud. The joke is that the voice actor would accidentally read this text without actually being supposed to. Amber then tells him he shouldn't read the text inside brackets out loud, and then the voice of the 'director' tells the 'crew' to keep rolling despite this obviously staged error.That's not good.Then we have some direct references to other games and whatnot in forms of ""this is not Resident Evil"" and the really cringeworthy CSI: Miami 'yeahhhh' joke. Not terribly impressive and only really yank the player out of the world in the game. Granted, this kind of humor can be found from many games of this genre, but it's really easy to have too much and it shouldn't be shoved down your throat like this.Then we have some jokes that are outright broken. At one point there's an acoustic guitar on top of a cabinet. Bear comments it by saying something along the lines of: ""It makes me want to get up on the stage and smash up the drumkit."" See, it would kind of work if it was an ELECTRIC guitar, but it's not. Why would an acoustic guitar evoke any sort of rock 'n roll spirit? It makes no sense.Next, we have many, many jokes about the development of this game and games in general. About how the writing is lazy and how the graphic artists are lazy and so on and so on. Again, poor fourth wall. But are these really even funny to anyone apart from the development team past maybe the first one? If you have to use that joke, don't write like ten of them in a two-hour game.In conclusion, I have to say you can tell love went into making this game. As I understand, the writer of the game was also the director, and possibly also the person who originally came up with the whole idea to make this game in the first place. The writing as a whole isn't terrible, in fact, I thought the more serious parts were pretty well written. If you don't mind humor that constantly breaks the fourth wall with plenty of references to things other than the story itself, you will probably enjoy this game - it's a solid game on other respects, gameplay, atmosphere (apart from the absence of music) and the voice acting are all good.I did enjoy the game and will be eager to see how the rest of the game will turn out. Here's hoping the writing matures a little bit on the episodes that follow, though."

On the second go around, I'm pretty sure I finished it in about 20-30 minutes, since I knew what I was doing. If you replay it (or are impatient the first go around), never fear! Cause you can speed through dialogue, skip the comic scenes, and double click locations instead of waiting for her to walk to them. The bear is cute, the graphics are cute.
