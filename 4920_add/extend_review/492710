I play a lot of real life ping pong and was excited to be able to play at home. This isn't anything like the real game. I had to dramatically change my style. The spins don't register as well.Summary: If you are a real life ping pong player, you won't enjoy this.UPDATE: It looks like this review garnered a lot of attention and maybe criticism due to its short amount of words.Let me be clear of my expectations: I bought this game because I love ping pong. This game isn't being advertised as some futuristic pong like game like Holoball. The picture literally says ""table tennis simulator,"" so the game should simulate playing ping pong. Did it correctly simulate table tennis? NO. It's nowhere close to being the real thing and doesn't deserve to be called a ""table tennis simulator."""

I'm no expert ping pong player but have played a bit of table tennis in college. This game is fun and essentially, captures the 'ebb and flow' of a real match. The environment is good, the crowd's applause and boos help with the immersion and the modes so far (a full tournament, broken table mode where parts of the table where the ball bounces disappears, practice mode etc.) are well realised.The physics could do with little tweaks though, the serving mechanics take some time to get used to (I don't have a problem with it though I can see why people would want other options) and a multiplayer mode would be awesome (devs are aware of this request!). The devs appear dedicated and the update today (7/11/2016) seems to have implemented a few community requests already (logo on ball, serve using any button).

It's definitely not 1:1 with real ping pong, just like pool nation is not 1:1 with real pool; but it feels DAMN good. Sometimes I feel like I'm being cheesed on the harder level or in the later stages of the tournament with the rabid corner shots (that deflect directly off the side of the table but give the AI a point). I found myself laughing hysterically standing about 5 feet behind the virtual table in the last round of the TT Tournament, Forrest Gumping my way to a narrow defeat.

,Recommended,492710,24306510,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,Bones,"So, in my opinion, this is the first killer app for VR. Ping pong is a game where you dont get tired of the mechanics right away. A lot of games are fun, but this one is the first one that really encompasses the whole sport per say. If you like ping pong, this is the game for you. It has a tournament so you feel like you are progressing, somethign a lot of games dont have. Dificullty is nice, I have played a little bit of ping pong in real life and am pretty average at it. The average opponents on here I can defeat about half the time so far. Close to real life as I have seen.Things to work on- Air resistance, I felt like a lot of my shots went long when they  probably shouldnt have- English, I see the ball spinning in the game which is really cool, but it doesnt seem to curve- Side\corner bounces, Also another cool feature, but they should probably be limited somehow, because a few times I was tempted to jump into the wall to go after a ball that hit the exact edge of the table. Perfectly viable in real life, but maybe tone it down for headset wearers.- Better graphics, I like the current ones, but could probable be upgraded- Last, maybe a coach of some sort, or a girlfriend\friend that cheers just for you, gives you tips, jeers the other team with funny one liners.Overall, really great start, and something I could play 'as is' for hours. I will try to update once I get more game time in."

The tournament mode really is enjoyable and challenging.A few suggestions:1) Please improve the BALL SOUNDS. They are quite bad (clackity clack)2) Please lessen the AI doing edge shots on later levels of the Tournament as this has made me lose my finals all the time.
76561197963648283,Recommended,492710,24180609,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,CharlesFBI,"Feels very much like real table tennis once you get used to the slightly different feel of it, which is that you can't hit the ball quite as aggressively as you can in real life, but it's not a huge adjustment to make. After about 3 hours of gameplay it feels natural and reminds me a lot of the real thing. The only frustrating things are the sudden bursts of power, i.e. you're going for a normal shot and the ball just flies too far with full power, seemingly for no reason. Not a huge problem in the first matches but when the AI gets tougher these 'glitch shots' kinda ruin the feel of an evenly matched game. Serves are often problematic too since they tend to go full power very easily. Other than that the serve mechanic is very nice in my opinion and feels natural despite it being one-handed. That and the AI hits the ball onto the sides/corners of the table a bit too often. I know this happens in real life too all the time but not this often :).All in all a very enjoyable experience. I don't really play a lot of games for hours on end anymore, but this feels like it could be one of those games. With VR games like this it's actually starting to feel like it's bridging the gap between games and real sports, this game (when the kinks are ironed out) isn't about who presses the keyboard or controller quicker, it's only about you and the racket. As such it's immensely more rewarding than games that only require you to press skill buttons consecutively."

Please use the second controller to throw instead, and discard use of grip button - it's not easy to use. (resolved in update 12/07/16)- Sound of the ball makes it feel like a golf ball.- Yellow line at eye level in the background is a distraction and is a similar color to the ball. Please change the line color. (resolved in update 12/07/16)- Pressing grip button to receive every serve is uncomfortable.  Either automatically serve with a visual clue or use another button that is easier to use like the trigger. (resolved in update 12/07/16)- Feels like i'm playing in an empty swimming pool (intended?). (addressed in update 12/07/16)Recommended as-is after update on 12/07/16 addressed most of my gripes."

It does take a little time to get used to the weight of the Vive controller and the ball may feel a bit lighter than a real one but after 10-15 mins of adjustment you will be hitting corners left and right. I would advice to play with the paddle rotation in the setting since thid made a great differece to me.As it is an early access game, it does not have many options. You can play a game or a tournament (difficulty increases by round rather than by opponent), practice vs an AI opponent, and play some minigames (at the moment there are three with a couple more to come soon).There are a couple of things that can -and probably will- improve:-More variety in the opponents. Right now they always look the same despite having different names. There could be some with black/blonde/no hair, different skin tones, eye colors or clothes, etc... This would give more variety to the matches (left handed opponents?).-It would be great if the Tournament could be expanded with a ""World Tour"" option in which particular tournament results could be tracked through a season (think Mario Kart).-Right now you can choose between four default positions for the table. However, an option to reposition it manually would be very welcome (Pool Nation VR does this brilliantly).-I know this is probably overkill for a $4.99 game, but it would greatly improve the longevity of the game if different opponents would have different play styles. Some could be very agreesive, others play always defensively, some would have a great service, while others would smash any ball that goes higher than it should.In any case, don't let these points prevent you from buying the game. For $4.99 it is a really well done Ping Pong game. Playability, graphics and music are already pretty good and the developer keeps working on it and updating it (the last update went live today)."

The feedback feels so real, helped by the fact that ping pong balls by nature are light anyway, but still the controller vibration on impact and physics just makes you feel like you're interacting with a real environment. It's exciting and fun and I can't wait to try all the other modes available.Though IRL I had been more into tennis, with the lack of anything for that I looked across all the table tennis/ping pong games and this stood out based on other reviews, and with my limited experience in it I sincerely this feels like a well crafted experience by someone who cares for it, and the updates that have been made already are encouraging.Though not bad either, I can't see myself even returning to holoball after this which is the closest VR comparison I've played myself.

PLEASE consider adding the option to rotate the paddle by 90 degrees.I found it really awkward to hold at the angle that felt right to me (maybe I've got bad ""technique"") ;)It would also help with the weighting which feels off when I rotate the physical controller to be right for my ""style"".Also. A way of skipping over the long drawn out menus that you have to go through to either start a new match or if you fail on an arcade challenge.

In wii you just need to reach the ball then hitting back is basically automatic with a flick of hand but in this game you will need to do the full real-life movements. In the game I preserved most of my play style and weaknesses from reallife table tennis so in terms simulation I would say it is the most realistic simulation game I have played.The top and back spin are pretty decent but there is no side spin in the game.What I would complain about in the game is that for a serve the tossing and hitting are done with the same hand. It is really hard to get used to.I think the Following can be improved:Serve : a serve should be done using both hands, one to toss the ball and the other to hit it.Spin :  side spin should be added to the game, it is a major part of pingpong."

One of those games where you lie to yourself, saying ""just one more game"".There are a couple of issues I've experienced which I hope will be addressed:1. Occasionally when you hit the ball it decides you've hit it 2-3 times harder than you were expecting. Not a big issue, as didn't happen often. If it happens a lot for anyone it may be more a tracking issue with the Vive setup than the game.2. Sometimes when the ball misses the edge of the table, it is registered as having hit the table, giving the AI a point. NOTE this is different to when the ball hits the edge and goes off at an angle. That's just true to real life ping pong, but still annoying :P.Only a couple of things I can think to add to this game:1. Some less voxel-based graphics, because it's a repetitive and tiring style now.2. A control to increase intensity of haptic feedback when hitting the ball.For £4, this is a really fun little game."

This DOES not have to be realistic at all!Don't bother too much with setting the ball location with the trackpad, just place the ball in the center of the paddle.If you want to let players move it anyway:The math for moving the ball seems to be a bit wrong aswell. Since you're on UE4: You might use Set Relative Location from the ball's parent and clamp it to the paddle radius and you basically use the same math as moving a character around with the trackpad.

If this game had the physics of Ping Pong Waves mixed with the content it already has, this game would be great."

Especially for thisaffordable price."

You end up not even thinking about your hands or lining up a return because it's accurate and responsive enough to immerse you in the game.Really good players (and pretty decent players like myself) can fuss a bit about the feel but like I said it will surprise you how good it really is and the potential for maybe another PP simulator to get it just right.  You likely won't be as good right away as you are IRL but how close this little sim gets is kind of off-the-hook good.A big help would be for the devs to implement a simple buzz from your Touch controller when hitting the ball for extra realism.  Would be simple to do and add even more realistic feel.Seriously, it's only a couple bucks you just can't go wrong.  Just have a bit of swing space handy or you'll get too involved not to backhand your desk or something that's out of your guardian zone.  Glad they make these controllers pretty hardy...9/10 would break finger again!"
