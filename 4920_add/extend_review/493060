Great controls, great graphics and effects, and fun for solo or local play, either way. It would be great if you could save the upgrades, but then again, it would not make any sense since you could easily get coins for upgrading your tanks.Hoping this game gets more updates in the future, like missions, challenges, more levels, etc."

Tried all the various guises, like Tankr, Tank Brawl, Tank Blast but this one, Ballistic Tanks, is the KING.  A game now firmly established on my Favourites playlist, which in itself is quite a feat!Amazing fun with friends (apart from the Planes mode).Buy it!"
,Recommended,493060,25607119,"Posted: 20 September, 2016",all,ZOMG_Py,"I'll be honest, this style of game was one of those which I really enjoyed back in my childhood, but that's not to say this game doesn't do it well. It offers four tanks (the normal), as well as four surprise unlockables. While it doesn't offer too much in terms of the campaign, the versus mode is actually pretty good. There's the good ol' deathmatch which lasts until you get blown up three times, there's the juggernaut mode where you have to attempt to destroy the big freaking tank, and there's a special powerup mode for really frantic gameplay.For the kind of game that it is, the power-ups, the weapons, the graphics, and the background music are each absolutely godlike. The main menu music with its techno, the versus mode with its jazz-esque techno. Let's be fair, of course it'll be techno, it's advertised in the trailer.For £3.99 (well, -20% for me for launch discount!), this game is actually really fun. Sadly I don't have anyone to play it with though...Let's just cover a bit on what to expect when you open the game:*Open the game.*Play the campaign.*Understand literally everything you do.*Die 3 times.*Game over.*Play Vs. Mode.*Realise that the bots are too easy and up their difficulty.*Get absolutely curbstomped by the opponent CPUs.*Play Juggernaut.*10/10 would explode again.Oh, and for those of you collectors, there are STEAM TRADING CARDS!"

For some reason, the game can't decide whether it wants a mouse or controller, even though I have my controller connected. Another problem, pausing the game sends the pause menu off screen to the top left corner where I can barely see ""Exit"". The game also needs some proper calibration as the turret controls are a little stiff when using a controller. One last thing, there's A LOT of slow down for a game that doesn't require much in power. My PC far exceeds the requirements. I hope these are fixed soon."

'Seriously, there is nothing in this game that justifies anything close to 1920x1080, 800x600 would be decadent, this is just silly'...Etc etc. BUT! This is getting fixed! and resolution based running problems aside, it's a truly awesome game.It's a close likeness to/an evolution of a game I played as a tiny kid in the 80's called Battle Tanks on the Mattel Intellivision. I've been looking for something to scratch the itch that game gave me for about 29 years, if you're casually hunting for the same thing, this scratches that itch and throws in a free metaphorical handjob for good measure.To those of you who have no idea what game I'm going on about; I've been a gamer all my life, and the kind of gamer that would try a lot of games but only really put the time in on very few, I'm incredibly picky... Ultimately this game has gnawed on my mind since I was 4-ish, I've found it after nearly 30 years of anticipation, romanticism and warped nostalgia and it's genuinely more satisfying to play than I remembered or expected. No idea why games like this havent been a staple like space invaders, pac man, bomber man etc. It's a must try."

,Recommended,493060,34526383,Posted: 27 August,all,maxnormal,Great visceral arcade action.  Fast and brutal. The randomised screens keep the gameplay interesting - you never have any certainty about what is coming next.Shots have a great punchy feel - powerups even more so. and the music gets the adrenaline going. Looking forward to trying co-op sometime soon.

Well buy this, its cheap, you learn the controls in no time and you'll need a break after an hour. Clean and simple fun. Bonus: Developer is active and added stuff like dogfight for free. Works great with xbox360 and xbone gamepads."

,Not Recommended,493060,31099122,Posted: 12 April,all,JetStream,"Graphics is very good, it is smooth, and the AI is pretty well balanced, but there are 3 major issues.1) The accuracy count literally ""forgets"" all except your current round for kills, but keeps ALL of the shots fired.  By the time the player gets past round 5 or so, the ""accuracy"" count drops below 20% because you've shot ~70 times overall, but the kills for the current round only is about 10. Big oversight in the stat counters.  EDIT: Also, just thought of another reason the ""accuracy"" count is broken. ""Accuracy"" in any other game means ""average chance a shot fired HIT an enemy,"" but here it means enemies Killed. Enemies with armor can take 2 ""hits"" if hit from the wrong side.All in all, this game counts accuracy as: ""number of enemies killed (last round only) divided by the number of shots fired (for the entire match).""2) This is the main reason for not recommending, there is no way to save upgrades between matches AND you can't upgrade between rounds either. I.E. Any coins spent on upgrades are forgotten the next time the player loses.  If you can collect coins at all and spend them before a match, WHY forget the upgrades after the match is done?3) I know this is a very simple game, but the planes mode makes me cringe."
,Recommended,493060,28211903,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,Slinky & Snudis,"What I liked;It's a tank game, can't go wrong since I love COMBAT on Atari 2600.The developer is responsive and fixes bugs when alerted.What I didn't like;Game PlayMajor gripe: you shoot a tank it explodes, for a moment you enjoy the beauty of that explosion (which overtaxes your CPU) and then a shot comes out from the dead tank you destroyed wiping you out.Minor gripe: the game field is small relevant to the tanks, so there's not much place to hide or be strategic, you just have to run around really fast either in circles or scrolling off the screen to the other side. Also, you get majorly out-numbered too fast into the game. I like the tanks AI, but when there are so many it's too easy for them to surround you making escape impossible sometimes, especially if you get spawned into a bad spot.I don't like how your weapons run out so fast, I would prefer to be able to upgrade the tank and constantly level up to meet the new challenges.It's a good tank game for a fast hit, but it gets too hard too fast.I find the rolling tracks that make you go fast in one direction or slow in another kinda annoying, but the moving walls are the most annoying, not sure how that even fits into the tank theme, it's more like Breakout in that respect.It will be interesting to see where this game goes, right now it's definitely not the last tank game in need in my collection."

The controls are smooth and easy, and the music fits in perfectly as well. Like everybody else, I would suggest an online multiplayer. It would be one of the best things you could add in the game. ;) Nevertheless, I would certainly recommend getting this game."

,Recommended,493060,32965066,Posted: 28 June,all,mgb360,"A nice little game. Simple, and good fun. The planes mode is a chaotic mess where you will die more to crashing into things that actual missles, but it's fun anyway. Got 257% accuracy in versus mode, not sure how that happened. I haven't had any problems with bugs, so it appears that the complaints in some of the negative reviews have been fixed."
,Recommended,493060,34522146,Posted: 26 August,all,The Ninjaneer,"Now, I'm going to preface this by saying that I have unlocked all 8 tanks in about 1.5 hours of playtime.However, I really do like this game. When your shots connect, it feels right. I've never said ""wow jeez that didn't hit me"" unlike some other games I play. The different types of modes and ways to play keep the game interesting, as the juggernaut is a strong tank but can be taken down if it isn't careful.The survival mode is a great way to practice alone, as it will teach you how to engage multiple enemies at once.The music is fitting to the game and its style.However, this IS a party-sort of game with local multiplayer. If you want to play with friends you're going to need to bring the game to them somehow. This is understandable to me, as any sort of lag would make the game feel inaccurate, and you would be saying things like ""why does my tank shoot through the enemy"" and ""that shot was eight miles away"" which would be a little problematic for obvious reasons. Maybe LAN play would be fast enough to keep up.The planes feel very much like they belong. It is elegant and smooth to fly, and is quick to pick up but challenging to master. Personally, I would enjoy seeing planes expanded into more gamemodes and (wishful thinking) boats. Of course, this would defeat the purpose of the name of the game. I just really like how well planes was done. Neato.Anyway, it's only $5 right now. I paid less for it on sale. The devs are actively fighting bugs and asking for the few people who own this game to find them and report them. If you like tanks and you don't have any friends who live close to you, this may be a good game for you to pick up. Maybe even wait for a major sale when it'll cost even less.I really like tanks."

Sad, such a fun game to play with friends. :(-Not so much about control customization, but not so much of a problem either, but the inclusion would be nice.-Price should be a little bit lower, but get in on a sale and problem solved.Personaly I do recommend this game if you don't mind the lack of Online MP, still a very fun game if you invite some friends to your house or to pass the time by yourself."

There's a known issue since xmas 2016 that the game won't download for Windows 7 32 bit (and possibly other versions too).   Sometimes my controller will work on a menu, sometimes it doesn't and I'm using the standard MS xb360 wired controller.  Whenever I see the game over/continue screen, I can't actually select continue as no controller or keyboard key works.  There's slowdown when the game has to draw 3-4 tanks on a screen with a couple of them shooting.  Which, you know, is like 90% of the game.Assassin's Creed Unity was more polished on launch than this title.  It's a shame too because I think I'd really enjoy the game if it was finished."
