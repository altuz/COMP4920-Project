,Recommended,493100,24734461,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,Vulcan,"*EDIT: It does look like the developers have abandoned this game.  I'm not going to thumbs down it however becuase it's still a blast to play and it still works. My review below still stands, just be aware that it's starting to look like the game that you buy now is all you will get.Honestly I was expecting something like Space Pirate Trainer.   Compared to this game SPT is downright boring!  The soundtrack is old-school 80's style.  The commentary reminds me of the old ""HEADSHOT!"" days of Unreal Tourney.  And holy cow is it a workout.  Honestly if you are trying to choose between SPT or this game, go for Belly Bots.  You won't regret it.Pros:Soundtrack.Rapid action that doesn't stop till you are worn out.Different levels offer some interesting variations.You have a top hat and moustache on your space helmet. (Look at your shadow)Your helmet actually cracks when you take damage.Cons:No menu or way to pause/escape the action that I could find.Edit. They added pause ability.No level select.Overall 9/10"

Silly aestetics, catchy song and very polished gameplay all make it one of the most enjoyable games I've played. It takes everything that made SPT great and improves upon it in almost every way.Pros:- You have a tophat.- Every gameplay aspect feels polished and thought through.- Great use of spatial audio. You always know precisely where enemies are and when they shoot.- Awesome level design with nice difficulty curve.- Catchy music and amazing sound design. Shooting feels so satisfying!Cons:- No way to pause.- Graphics have a little bit of aliasing.Despite having some minor issues, BellyBots is hands down the best VR arcade shooter."

,Recommended,493100,29857242,Posted: 11 February,all,Bassem,"One of the earliest wave shooters and one of the most funI just finished a full playthrough of the twenty levels... it felt like I played triple that! This game is woefully underrated.If I described it as ""wave shooter with one weapon and three enemy types"" that would be an accurate description, but it would do nothing to convey how insanely fun and *relentless* this game is. I had to take a break (thankfully supports pause with Menu button) to wipe down my headset and controllers, wash my face, and strip down to my underwear (in the middle of winter). It's such a workout. It's simple in the best of ways, as an arcade game should be.The appeal of it is in the carefully laid out waves of enemies that come in all kinds of patterns and layouts. Twenty levels feels more like sixty... I was loudly exclaiming ""NO MORE"" and ""♥♥♥♥"" as I bent backwards like Neo to avoid enemy fire while shooting my dual pistols each to one side. I kept wondering if the levels were generated on the fly because it honestly felt like I was at level 50 or something.At $7.99, it's reasonably priced for what it has. Please give it a go, it keeps escalating until it leaves you breathless. Don't be turned off by the waveshootiness of it. This is good stuff."

They consider putting in 1 (one!!!) additional week for further developing this game and that was it.Don't do the same mistake I did: don't buy abandonded EA shovelware"

A must buy if your into work out type of room scale vr games. I appreciated that when you die, you don't start over from the beginning."

,Recommended,493100,28935172,Posted: 2 January,all,G-Dub,"This is one of the underated gems of early VR. Simple and sweet, you get two big guns with unlimted ammo and blast your way through waves of robots that shoot slow-motion energy blasts at you. Destroying all bots while making use of the room-scale to dodge the slow motion bullets makes you feel pretty badass and also makes for a great work out. If you want to be good at this game, be prepared to work up a sweat moving around the playspace.This game is great for short spurts of tense epic gunplay. If this were an arcade cabinet I would gladly play way more than $7.99 to own it. Pick this one up, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"

76561197983030739,Recommended,493100,24544287,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,JoOngle,"Simple but kind of addictive shoot-em-up arcade game.Since this is an early access game, please treat this review the same way - it was reviewed on the basis of the game I purchased on the 26th of July 2016.The game is a straight forward shoot-em-up game, you get two guns you can pick up at the start of the game, and then the game lets you shoot robots that during the game looks exactly the same all the time. They all stand still on platforms. Eventually you get some shields you can ""hide and dive"" behind, but you can accidentally blow those up yourself as well.At the time of writing this review, this is all there is to the game, there's this voice that will tell you how fantastic you are while hitting those robots, and each ""level"" consist of new pods to stand on, sometimes higher, sometimes closer and sometimes lower - but essentially the same design each level. The game doesn't seem to have any leaderboards or scoreboards at the moment, except for one long continous score that keeps increasing, even after you lost your 4 hearts.Pros:- Simple, entertaining shooter that even your smallest kids can be in on.- Low priced, arcade style game.- Lag free, no glitches, all real time. I'm GUESSING this one would even work with low end graphics cards.- Potential to become a great shooter, it's an EARLY access game after all.Cons:- Seems like an early Beta.- Repetitive with little new added to each level.- No scoreboards, not even local.- Increasing score, you don't get a chance to start from scratch.- There's no menus (at least I can't find them) so it's basically just shoot-and-go-and-repeat."

It looked boring in screenshots, just another wave shooter. boooring was what i thought. But i decided to buy it anyway and man am I glad I did. The music is amazing and about as 80is as it gets, and the levels are really fun. Instead of just letting more and harder enemies attack u like SPT this waveshooter actually has designed levels. Played about 7 waves and every level was different with a great difficulty curve. Cant say if the game will keep adding new levels after that but so far its really fun"

I wanted to ""Die"" so I could start over, but each time I died, it replayed the same stage.  Would love a menu with a stage select, or at least the option to continue vs start over without quiting the game.  Other than that the game was a lot of fun....going to play it again right now."
,Recommended,493100,24587363,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,NFreak,"Honestly almost passed on this because of the name alone, but I'm so glad I gave it a chance. Starts off easy, but quickly picks up. The later levels will have you moving almost as much as Holopoint.Cheap, really fun game with a great aesthetic. Definitely worth picking up."

,Recommended,493100,24962637,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,StylixDS,"In the game's current state it is really fun to play. Initially it comes off seeming too easy, all enemies die in one hit. Then you get a few levels in, if you aren't a quick shot you'll be overwhelmed fast. Bullets coming from you at all directions and the only thing you can do is duck and dodge while still plucking them off until the onslaught stops.The only gripe I have is that while you can continue if you stay in the game, it doesn't seem to give you the option when you come back to the game later. Since this game requires a lot of movement, you'll feel like taking breaks. It is in early access though so I don't fault them for not having something like this implimented yet. It's such a standard option I'd think it will eventually be added.Also the song that plays in the background, along with the semi-cutesy robot theme, and the fact your shadow is a top hat complete with handlebar mustache and monocle, makes you feel like you're the star of some 90's saturday morning cartoon. This is by far my favorite reason to play."

I won't say it's better than SPT because the skill ceiling is so much higher in that game, but in pure fun factor this probably has it beat. First game in a while to just have me full on giggling.update - my last review was made with the assumption that we'd actually be getting some more levels, ever. don't buy for now until they actually do something more with the game."
