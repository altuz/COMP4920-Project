The visuals might set some people off, but personally I found the bare aesthetic pretty nice. The background and story of the game are both interesting. It is pretty simple once you get down to it and can be a little hard to pierce the diluge of information the game presents you with at the start. Otherwise, well worth your time and money if you enjoy space strategy games."

Would be fantastic with mp but I dig the weekly competitions making sp a lot of fun. A nice indie game proving design trumps graphics. I recommend this game to my friends and especially any serious strategy gamers.
76561198034508661,Recommended,493220,30936585,Posted: 3 April,all,molotov21forever,"EDIT: Developers have stopped responding in the forums and there are bugs that haven't been fixed. The game is still fun and playable for me, but it is disappointing to imagine how much further this game could go with a few small updates.Pretty great little strategy game. Watching the colored fleets surround each territory and battle for victory is soothingly satisfying. I have yet to beat the hardest difficulty, which shows how the AI is pretty smart (and as the game states, they do NOT cheat with resources)."

I have enjoyed what little time I have put into, it, and using the help mode and tutorial is a must. Also, try playing in 720p if the font bothers you. Really like this game. price is more than fair."

If you can stick with it for an hour, you'll learn the basics, but I have a feeling its going to take a long time to master it. Seems to be a very deep and complex game with a very interesting story."
76561197985308723,Recommended,493220,32099894,Posted: 31 May,all,devotion,"Pros: this is a neat little game.  For a game that only takes a couple hours to beat (after I learned it), it is effective at giving the feel of a very-high-level empire ruler scenario. The lore and names are quite compelling for something that only represents AIs/religions/cultures with little icons. The game presents interesting tactical problems, and outside of the strategic realm choosing where to attack, emphasize attacking, defend, etc. is quite fun.The cons below are pretty specific but don't take them to be a lack of a recommendation. This costs half what a movie does and I got more entertainment out of it than most movies.---Cons: The gameplay seems...built to be deep, but doesn't present choices as effective as I'd like.1. The styles of military conquest aren't different enough that I play them differently: there are three types of warfare (glory/fleet/crypto), and always a sort of cultural and religious ranking about which is most preferred, not so preferred, and hated. Call it good war/ok war/bad war, regardless of how fleet, crypto, or glory is ranked. There's nothing intrinsically different about playing a military empire regardless of which you choose.2. I don't see any penalty or reason not to economically blockade all 3 types of trade routes (guilds/routes/pilgrimages) if you're going to do any one of them. It's not like wars where one kind of war makes more rebellion. Why would I keep goods flowing through one type of trade route if I'm blocking another? I don't get it.3. Maybe I'm not playing right, but the economic presets seem not to matter too much either. Just go with the tutorial recommended auto allocation and you can win at least up to hard (which is the middle difficulty). I felt like I miiiiight get some benefit by reallocating rearguard territories for economic or civic...but not really. Considering this is a game I want the feel of big strategy from without the endless time sink of a big 4x space game, I felt like the time to figure out a new preset for territories that might get threatened or attacked at a moment's notice and then switch them back wasn't worth it. But then again some territories are effectively at peace because their bordering factions don't care to war with you. If you could assign and deassign territories to custom groups and *then* allocate presets (instead of to the automatic border/near border/interior groups) this might be more worth it. Either way, I beat the game without fussing with it."
,Recommended,493220,31142624,Posted: 14 April,all,Alexander Steele,"Having played this game for almost 4 hours I can now write a review.Initially the game looks very complex but if you persevere with the tutorial and take your time reading all the text the game can be more easily grasped.It does have a steep learning curve but I assure you once you get the basics it can be quite compelling.You start off by choosing a territory amongst a list on the top right of the screen. This is in order with the strongest territory at the top so you can guage which territory will have the easiest start.Then you choose one of six archetypes which, as far as I can tell are a kind of philosophy which provides various bonuses to different things.As there are 3 types of attack (Military, Crypto and Glory) these choices affect the bonuses for each of these attacks.So if you prefer to win with military force you choose an archetype geared towards military bonuses. This helps with the production of fleets etc...I found the easy level of play quite comfortable to learn the game but not really that challenging. On the normal level it was more challenging and fun.Graphically the game is not really great,although I personally find the graphics ok for this kind of game. Actually I quite like the graphics. You can tilt the galaxy map for aesthetics if you wish.When a war is declare on a territory you see your little fleets surrounding the enemy territory and you see a percentage going up towards 100, The more past 100% the faster the civilization loss in the territory. When the civilizations are reduced to zero the territory is taken over by the attacker, or whoever contributed the most attack power.You can also research and build buildings in each territory which help your faction.I know that I have merely skimmed the surface with this basic review but there is so much depth to this game that I cant possibly explain everything.In summary I love this game and I found it very addicting and I am looking forward to playing more.Also the price is very low compared to other similar games. Excellent value for money.I think I will purchase the Viceroy also from the same developer.Thanks for reading this."

I am confused about the amount of detail there is and what you can't see (at least I can't). I have a lot to learn before I can beat this game. And this is in a good way. I'm interested not bored.

76561198064043270,Recommended,493220,30863769,Posted: 31 March,all,Gray Knight,I would like a better help or guide because the one in game is lack luster in the amount of infomation it gives you and in how organized that infomation is.
76561198092999363,Recommended,493220,31595547,Posted: 6 May,all,Geno1664,"I ended up refunding this game, but not because it is bad. It is because the game was designed for a market I am not in, as well as most people who see this title pop up on steam. Distant Worlds: Universe or Stellaris, re games which can take over 20 hours to play one game, with gameplay that is an interlocking system of values that is big and complex. This game is not that. Although I did not finish a full game, I imagine one can take under 5 hours, if that. It is also quite simple in its mechanics, though it still has a lot of depth in said mechanics. I can imagine this being a great game for those who want a grand strategy that can thouroughly learned quickly, and does not take long to beat a match. However, those looking for an epic game that takes days or even weeks to beat, with tons of values, units, and other s**t, will not find it here."

Kind of reminds me of a Risk game put digital and then X 100,000 instead of winning the world your winning a galaxy. The guy building it is dedicated to supporting it and making it work. The price is super affordable.Definately worth a buy!"
76561198070742314,Recommended,493220,33237214,Posted: 4 July,all,ruppert29,"High learning curve  as it seems you are juggling 21+ settings, 6 archetypes (class), 18 religions, 18 cultures, 3 paths, technology, 3 ways to attack (fleet, crypto (hacking) or glory), etc. You are at war with territories without even starting the conflict because your archetype, culture or religion say you are. All in all a lot to grasp but by playing or watching some youtubes you slowly mesh the concepts into a strategy (win fast) or fail (die fast) on a small map.  Still a victory is satisfying as you increase the difficulty or map size."

76561197985573260,Not Recommended,493220,34720759,Posted: 3 September,all,Hade,"No option to change resolution. Text and the gazillion icons are too small.EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATED in the game, only thing you're allowed to do is declare war and then wait to see if your dots capture it, then repeat that over and over.Tutorial is garbage. You can't get anywhere in the tutorial (which is difficult to follow). Restarted the game several times, however the AI just conquers everything around you so you can't get anywhere.The turotial doesn't explain anything. There are too many obscure meanings to be able to understand your choices at the beginning. What is a civilazation build, what does it do? What is a crypto building, what does it do? What's the differnce between the 3 differnt types of war options? What the hell does anything do? It took me a while just to figure out how to declar war because the tutorial really doesn't tell you. It's just mostly trial and error, click this, see what it does.The first task in the tutorial is to conquer 1-2 territories around you. Unfortunately all the AI's around you do that. Cheating AI, it gets priority over you, so if you and another AI go for the same territory, the AI will get it everytime. My 10th tutorial restart, I tried to atleast capture one territory (I let it run for 15 minutes), again, I watched as the AI captured territory after territory, while I got nothing, and I was even attacking a small AI with hardly any ships (dots) and it was capturing territory after territory with no problem. After a while, I was attacked and wiped out, and this was on EASY level, WTF!Every other game tutorial I've ever played, the player was actually given the opportunity to get somewhere so they can learn the game.After an hour I had enough. But if you're into games that give the AI a huge advantage, then this game is for you.Utter waste of money."

Offers excellent replayability with faction customization options enabling the player to pursue differing paths to ultimate victory.

People like to write wishy-washy reviews where they say, ""I wish there was a kinda-sorta rating...""  That's not what this review is about.  This is an unequivacal ""no!""  No way!  No how!  By no means should you get this game!The critical fail here is that the font size is so incredibly small as to make the game unplayable.  I don't remember what the game costs, but it is not worth your eyesight.  Silly me, I thought when the developer came out recognizing the issue that we'd see a fix for it.  I waited too long though, and when I gave up and tried to return it Steam said I was past the return window and my return request was rejected.  Ugh!  That burns!  Please let my disappointment be mitigated by serving as a warning to others."
