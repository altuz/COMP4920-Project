,Recommended,493280,33667662,Posted: 20 July,all,Amphh,"WallslideThis game is a 3D platformer that's fun, fast-paced, and easy to pickup. Unfortunately as of this review, the game has not been updated for nearly a year. However, I would still recommend it based on the fact that it is only$1.99, and is an enjoyable game, especially if you enjoy the ""Vaporwave"" aesthetic. I did manage to beat all of the developer's 16 levels in 10 minutes, however. Be wary of that.Graphics are decentInteresting gameplaySoundtrack is tastefulOverall I rate this game:8/10"

,Recommended,493280,24390406,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,[IG] Dargon Dargon,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5fLVkrg2ZsWhen I first sawWallslide, I immediately thought this was a half-baked ripoff ofClusterTruck. After playing it, it takes the runner concept and puts its own interesting spin on it.Graphically, it succeeds in its low-poly feel. I hate constantly bringing upClusterTruckandSuperhot, but this game is another one in a long line of low-poly graphical games. It's nothing aesthetically groundbreaking by any means, but it pulls the style off solidly.The soundtrack fits with the parkour gameplay, but can throw someone off during the parts where you need precision rather than speed. I'd love additional tracks to be added the farther along this game's development goes.Playing this game on the keyboard and mouse can be a bit awkward. Well, the keyboard controls are easy and intuitive, but the mouse is where it gets iffy, considering you have to hold up the mouse to keep your upward momentum (or, at least, that's how I've found it).Overall, it's an interesting game. Damn fun, but interesting on all fronts. It'll be cool to see how this game evolves the further it's developed."

Game is still in development so Im sure they will add more levels soon, anyway I recommend getting this game."

,Not Recommended,493280,34733013,Posted: 4 September,all,[S4Y] 🎃✞scaneloPT✞🎃,"Really beatiful game, nice mechanics, and cool concept making it.Unfortunatly the game is very small, I literally finished it in my first time playing it in less than 5min.It has a workshop, and an editor in the game, so you can easily make your own levels and download other levels made by players, but that was all of the game, this is more about other players levels than the game himself.- 16 Levels that can easily be beaten with a couple of tries, in less than 10 minutes;- Workshop and editor to play and create other levels;- Little, but nice soundtrack that fuses with the gameplay;- Mechanics are good, not fantastic, but playable and the gameplay with them is really fun;- Really good Concept.I rate it 5/10I would go with no problems for a rate like 8/10 or something like that, but although the mechanics sometimes are tricky but still good, the real problem is the 16 levels, you can easily beat this game within 10 minutes or less, and repeating the same levels all over again just doesn't feel the same, and the first 10 levels are really easy sooo. . . yeah. . .They could have done with no problem more levels for the game I don't know why they didn't do it, maybe they was a budget problem, or no time, I really don't know but I feel that they could have done more levels, even if they uploaded them like: month to month, something like an update, but they didn't and for the sake of that the game is real small.I would with NO DOUBT pay 1,99$ for this game I would even pay 9,99$, but for THIS VERSION WITH 16 LEVELS? No thanks.There is been almost an year since the release of the game, so I'm not looking so forward to this game, I hope they release they release the full version of the game, if they release it. . . there is been almost a year since the release of this ""demo"" that's why I don't recommend this game, I have seen a lot of game Producers saying that ""it's coming more!"" but they never actually make more. I'm not looking forward for this game, but I would like to be. I hope the creators understand, and make finally their full release."

However I'm not sure this is possible. I have also had some crashing problems lately with this game, and would like to see that fixed.I think this game has a lot of potential and I am excited to see where it will head."

76561198072680595,Not Recommended,493280,29831869,Posted: 10 February,all,benvlieg,"When I first played this game in January 2017 I gave it a thumbs down. The controls were inconsistent (For me) to the point that the game became unplayable. I decided to try in again in August 2017 ad to my relief the controls were much more consistant.There are other problems with the game that was so frustrating I uninstalled in. Half the time when trying to jump off walls, the game didn`t pick up the press of space bar. This bug was tolerable since levels only take a few seconds.What ruined the game for me was the hit detection on the pink block. Most of the time I should have missed the pink stuff but the game detected that I touch it. If the pink object was in the middel third of the screen thats fine, but when the object is on the right 1/4th of the screen thats a problem.I really wanted to like this game but it became unplayble and as such I cannot reccomend it. I will take a look at it in a few months to see how it is then and update my review."

76561198066105605,Recommended,493280,33845794,Posted: 27 July,all,Alphanumiral,"This is an interesting game and I have no idea how I found it but I'm glad I didThere are 16 levels so far in the game which took me all of 9 minutes to beat, but with the workshop this could lead to a lot of fun and in that short time period I was seriously focused on itIt's a cool experience where you can jump as much as you want provided you are next to a wall and it's fast, fun, and simple. I would say get it because for 2.19 CAD it's worth the price especially with more content coming soonThe only problem is that I didn't realise that you could jump on the walls so maybe if the dev sees this add that in the first level text so it is more blatant but overall i would say 6/10 right now, with expansion in length it could be 8 or 9 i would saybtw level 13 is kind of out of place"
