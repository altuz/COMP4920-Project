,Recommended,493490,26410773,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,HeroHarmony,"Played 5 hours in my first sitting and love it. I'm going to have my usual nightmares about difficulty driving each night I play this. I can feel it coming. A bit of background: I don't drive in real life. At least not at the time of this writing. I'm a normal human being, but I don't feel confident about my driving skill. This game really puts me to the test. Though it's not 100% matching the types of roads that I'm familiar with in Canada, its the closest compared to all the other games I've tried. I'm glad City Car Driving has finally made its way to Steam.If you thought you could be a good driver with Project Cars or Euro Truck Sim 2, this game will prove you wrong if you weren't already a driver. Be mindful that some rules or road systems may slightly differ from your local roads.This game is very strict on everything and is totally on the ball with telling you your mistakes or giving you a warnings to keep safety in mind. I sometimes complain about games that give you alerts too late, or leave old alerts on the screen that confuse you, but this game only tells you the now and happening. The only thing it's probably missing is a replay function for you to review what you did wrong. Otherwise this game is very much a learning tool. Most driving games don't punish you and take you off the road to restart like this does. The last time I played anything this strict on driving was from a Dreamcast game called ""Tokyo Bus Guide"" - which I played with a wheel as well.My experience with the game is by steering with the Logitech G27 and using TrackIR for headtracking. The G27 required keybinding, but its quite straight forward. TrackIR works flawlessly without having to do any setup. I've only borrowed an Oculus Rift before, but being able to see persepective with this game though a Head Mounted Display would definately be a huge plus as well.Even though the game is from 2007, you'll quickly forget about its graphics and keep your eyes on the road. I think the graphics are quite satisfactory for a car simulator though. The car interior is well done and the world outside blends together just fine. The traffic experience is terrific and weather effects, though not HDR ultra realistic, really do their job well.I'll be sinking a lot of hours into this. Hopefully it will encourage me to try taking my driving test in real life again."

While there are several other notable driving simulators such as BeamNG.drive, American Truck Simulator, and ETS2, no other simulator quite simulates driving a car in a city with realistically unpredictable traffic.Pros-Fun driving sim-Realistic traffic flow.-You can change the agressiveness and density of traffic in Free Drive (Agressiveness 100% + Density 100% = California metropolitan driving simulator)-There are no licensed cars but they are easily recognized (but debadged) cars.-Engine startup, seatbelt, parking brake, and shifting simulation-Career mode with driving school type campaign-Almost-constant feedback on your driving in Career or Free Drive mode if you are not a perfect driver (such as ""You are driving more than 5 mph over the speed limit"" or ""You did not use your left turn signal when changing lanes"")-Different sounds outside and inside vehiclesCons-The graphics are so-so-Police cars just drive around like civilan cars and do nothing else-You can hit other cars as many times as you want with ONLY visual damage (although you cannot do this in Career mode)-Cars handle like... crap. Obviously ecoboxes won't handle well but the car handling in general here is bad for a sim.-Audio can get very scratchy.-Very poorly optimized; in the time it takes to load up a Free Drive you can get your homework done or eat your lunch. This game will punish you if you try to exit while it is loading. Other games will crash if you close them while loading, but this one will turn the screen black indefinitely until you force your PC off by means of cutting the power. Also at times it can lag badly (causing you to crash the car) and the sound can be heard looping. In fact, the loading times are so horrific that I noticed little improvement when I moved CCD to a solid-state drive.The Pros outweigh the Cons somewhat, and this simulator is well worth the $24.99. It's great for driving enthusiasts and also great for those starting to drive in real life soon."

I mean it has everything going for it in terms of realism, but I struggle to get control of the car sometimes. That never happened irl when I was taking my lessons.

,Not Recommended,493490,31431239,Posted: 28 April,all,Dazz,"Ok, purchased as soon as I saw that Vive VR had been added.... But there are a lot of issues that I'm running into. VR feels like it is just tacked on and poorly done.  There are no ingame menus shown in VR.First, I use a Thrustmaster T80 wheel. Works great in Project Cars and other racing games. In City Car Driving the game will not recognize my pedals as an axis. Only button presses. PC sees pedals as axis.Second, no Automatic vehicles? Automatic Clutch and Automatic Transmission are 2 different things. With Automatic Transmission you do not have to change gears manually, only Reverse, Neutral, Drive. Here in the US it is pretty rare to come across standard/manual vehicles. As much as I'd love my son to drive a standard/manual that's not going to happen.Third, when in VR there is no indication of what gear you are in. Cant see if seat belt is on/off. Unable to see in game messages. There is also no indication of when the game needs attention like messages stating you ran off the course/excercise area, etc.As of right now, if you want to play in VR, I can't recommend this game at all... VR is very poorly added, doesn't really work mechanically, visually the game looks good when viewed in HMD.  If other aspects that are needed perhaps this could be better, but until then I've requested a refund. :("

[LET],"The game is meant to teach you how to drive, but there are too many rules of the road that are not implemented or are implemented incorrectly such as: U-turns (says you went into opposing traffic and penalizes you, but thats what you have to do in order to make a U-turn), right of way (gives trams and trolleys right of way over everything else, but they must stop at traffic lights), AI doesn't even make a rolling stop at red lights when they are turning right (you are supposed to stop before the limit line to check for pedestrians and then turn right after yielding to all other traffic), says you ran a red light when you entered the intersection when the light was still yellow (you are allowed to be in an intersection when your light is red as long as you entered the intersection on a green or yellow light, but you are not allowed to be sitting in an intersection when the light is green, yellow, or red, that is blocking the intersection which is illegal), there are giant 5 lane roundabouts (The US usually only has small 1-2 lane roundabouts in only residential districts), and many other things. The game is extremely unrealistic and almost unplayable. The only good part of the game is the career mode, but only the lessons that are not driving on actual roads (the courses with cones in the back of the DMV)"

This is clearly not a game.In that role, it is very good and complete. You have a career campaign, to train you with objectives like park your car, drive by night, with rain, etc... You have also a free and open driving mode, in which you can configure the map, the conditions, car, etc... Conditions are very complete, with weather, people behavior, presence of road works, policemen, etc...I wish one day, people can develop maps for different towns. But you can choose between European or American road system.I strongly recommend it if you need to have some training of car driving at home, with at least a wheel."

But, after about an hour i started to manage using the turnsignals, shifting gears, holding the speedlimits and following the trafficrules. even though i don*t have an steering wheel the game is now pretty entertaining. I am going to get a wheel, gearbox and pedals soon and i believe this is going to change the experience alot and make it even more joyful to play this good game. The menu is not to exciting, but it is very well made and systemised.Things i do not like about this game:Over all it is a pretty grat game, but there are some negatives. sometimes, other cars stop in the middle of a waycrossing and force you to slow down to like 3 mph/ stop yourself. Than you get a notification that you cant stop in a waycrossing. I have had some problems with the game not wanting to launch. several. times. This is very annoying cause i had to delete and download the game like 4 times. I believe this is caused by the cars i downloaded from the workshop. DO NOT DOWNLOAD CARS! If you already have messed up your game you can fix it by deleting the mods, deleting the game, deleting the folder called ""forward development"" on your computer and reinstalling your game. This worked for me and everyone else i've read about on the internet so far.What can be done better:Well over all, the traffic rules are good and the graphics are ok. Maybe you could have made it more real life-like by adding stuff like taxes and that you actually have to pay when you crash. Maybe the police could stop you if you drive too fast or something. I would also like more and bigger maps. Maby a bigger highway where you can drive alot faster.

,Recommended,493490,28959991,Posted: 2 January,all,[GTP] Dean,"The game is great although it doesn't have the latest in graphics - but for me that's not a big issue. The game excels in the realistic gameplay, and does so pretty well. Add the modding community and -possibilities gives one hours of endless fun. When driving with keyboard and mouse, it does get boring after a while, even with the mods in my opinion, however when using a steering wheel it's good fun for many hours. If you're about to take your driving license, this might even be a good learning tool, especially if you have a racing wheel and H-shifter available.Setting up my wheel (Thrustmaster's T500 RS) wasn't too difficult, however the different sliders are kind of hard to get just perfect. Setting up my H-shifter (the TH8 RS) was very easy though, just button mapping. The game supports TrackIR (also using FaceTrackNoIR) which is a very nice feature for those having the ability to use it, it makes it ten times easier to pan the camera compared to using the mouse.I've seen multiple people have issues with the downloaded mods from the Steam Workshop, I've had issues too, as the mods do not (at least for me) auto-install. It takes a bit of unzipping, folder moving and file editing to get the mods to work properly, it could've been much easier, yes, but there is a how-to guide on the CCD forums and once you know how to, it's not such a big pain. I've had only one issue with the mod cars once installed, and that was the ""ABS bug"", where the ABS tick box was greyed out, this however is solvable by following instructions also available on the CCD forums, and it doesn't appear again once all cars are installed as per those instructions.For the right person, this is a 10/10 game, but that will not be everybody. I recommend this game to those into simulation games, ETS2/ATS, OMSI and the like, who also has a racing wheel. If you do not have a racing wheel, I sadly doubt you'll find as much fun in this game."

,Recommended,493490,29183916,Posted: 11 January,all,marcelbreuning,"With the Oculus Rift, I like this a lot. Though it isn't really a 'game', it's more of a simulator. The driving lessons aren't always very clear about what exactly you need to be doing and for some reason I can't get into the parallel parking excersize without it telling me I stopped. Vocal instructions would have been a lot more useful.The sounds of the engines could be a little better, but the driving is cool and work well with my steering wheel and pedals. The cars on the workshop look great and you can really feel a difference between one car or another. It's  a little weird that there isn't any one command that let's you recenter the driving position so that you don't have to adjust your position everytime you get into a different car.All in all, this is nice as a sim, not great as a challenging game but cool in VR"

The engine sound must have been copied from an Atari gamebox. The graphics are just OK. Everything is clear and easy to read, but not a lot of detail. That's probabely OK, as it's not going to overwork your GPU. I'd like to see a module to calibrate the controls. My G27 is a little touchy when making turns. No where near the precision that can be had in iRacing. Overall, it's rather intertaining, and for the price I'd recommend it. It's a really good game for people to show off what the Rift can do.Update:I discovered after using this several hours, that this version is not really fully ready for VR.  On screen messages and instructions are not displayed in the Rift, and the speedometer is only shown in kilometers per hour. The developer says a fix is coming, but the way it stands now, it's not really ready for the Rift.I am backing off my comment about the graphics. The graphics are actually very good.

Initially I purchased the old version long time ago via their page. I did not know what to expect after years from last version I played but I gave it a chance. What I remembered about the game was that it quickly got boring due to lack of goal. Unfortunately - not much changed in this area.Game has its pros. It is a nice city driving experience. Newly implemented random events spice up the stuff and variety of nice add on cars is just great. Different weather types are nice although I miss dynamic weather. Physics are not so good but  if you drive slowly/accordingly to rules you won't notice that. Graphics, especially in new city improved a lot.So what is  my main problem? There are two:1. No purpose. As much as I understand it's a sandbox there is not enough things or situations to interact with. I miss a really simple feature like e.g. ability to transport people from one place to the other. (Taxi service) There is an option to dynamically get a route assigned but you do literally nothing on that route and that doesn't make sense to me.2. No map editor. I mean really? Considering size of current cities lack of map editor is a big sin from devs end as there is nothing dragging me back to CCD after I familiarised myself with map.Ultimately - i refunded it but I'm ready to rebuy as soon as there is some taxi element introduced and map editor is available. Also another minor request would be to improve force feedback as currently it's lacking in all areas."

With or without VR the game's movement is quickly nauseating inducing. I could only last a few minutes before I started sweating and getting sick. The head movement is badly done. The VR is nice but again find another game if you are susceptible to motion sickness.Another thing about this game. If you don't have a wheel the control setup on this game is esoteric and confusing. I never saw a bunch of more confusing setup commands for a game in my life. I tried to set up my Xbox controller and spent far to long playing around with what worked and didn't work. Get a damn clue in making this thing easier to set up simple driving controls.

Some penalties are a little too strict and will become annoying taking up your left side of the screen-But really someone please fix the breaks, they are not realistic!In all I do understand this has waaaayy more cons than pros, but it's the best car sim out there. I do want the developers to read my review and please fix all this. Mostly the brakes, adding stop signs, and more cars.But  hey, I still like the game aside from that. Also maybe add in a new map?Maybe it could also add in a sort of uber/taxi system. When it gives you waypoints to complete without any penalties, you don't get anything in the end.
