,Recommended,493580,26365096,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,SixthBlackWing,"OverviewThese are mostly older style HOG games that usually sport outdated graphics where you'll be straining your eyes to spot a certain object. I'm not exactly a fan of HOGs that only allow you look for 1-4 items at a time, but the price is hard to beat at $.5/game. No replayability so far except for that annoying competitive one.No option to skip text. FBI 2 crashed once. Not a fan of the faint white symbols everywhere determining what you can do when you can just barely see them - would've gone w/ something more visible such as a white interior & black/red outline. FBI 2 fixes this problem with the green-square symbols, but it's too visible/blocky now, so it gets in the way of surveying the area not that you do anymore inFBI 2 since it's just HOS/Puzzle one after the other.The extra info system should've been made more visible for more casual players that don't want to spend time trawling through pixel by pixel in order to find them.It seems like these may have been in a different language/translated wrong. There are a bunch of objects not being called correctly, or directly named causing confusion. If you're going to include sequels in the pack then why aren't they lined up properly? FBI 1 w/ FBI 2.#1 - FBI Paranormal Investigations - 2 Hrs longFBI Agent investigates aliens & bubblegum, lol.Revisit each scene 1-2 times with a few standalone rooms#2 - JFK - Hrs longNewer graphics, unfortunate mouse speed enforced, so it's a little annoying to get around, and faint white symbols to guide your gameplay which blend in with the background ,-,.#3 - Deadly Association - 1.5 Hrs longPolice Det. investigates a suspicious murder of a woman - one HOG scene to another, older style.#4 - FBI Petro$ - 1.5 Hrs longFBI investigates a murder connected to the oil company - One HOG scene to another, older style#5 - Statue of Liberty - Hrs longNewer graphics,#6 - Paranomal Asylum - Hrs longNewer graphs, Quirky extras info system found in invisible symbols on each location.#7 - Haunted House - Hrs longNewer graphical, glad that this one does not have the ridiculous time limit attached. Quirky extras info system found in invisible symbols#8 - FBI Paranormal 2 - 1.4 Hrs longOnly ~7 locations with each one revisited twice.One of their newer games with improved graphics, but it's worst one on this list. They try to add a competitive edge to a NON-COMPETITIVE gaming genre by timing/scoring you also once you reach the limit they make you restart, or continue through. Absolutely disrespectful of players given that no option to remove such stupidity was added. The enforced mouse speed is back with this game - not cool. Game crashed weirdly with one profile but the next did not. I don't know why you play HOGs, but it certainly isn't for a competitive edge...I play FPS for that.#9 - Jekyl & Hyde - 50minutes longSimple, but there are alot of find x10-20 scenes.#10 - Jack The Ripper - 1 Hr longPretty simple game throughout except for those annoying jail-sending questions, find differences in letters puzzles, and 1 very hard to find paper.#11 - Bonnie & Clyde - 2 Hrs longThere are a bunch of objects in this one where even if you strain your eyes you won't be able to see them. Annoying Map Puzzle that doesn't make much sense eventually figured out by trial & error.#12 - Frankenstein - 1.5 Hrs longFrankenstein has mutilated[& quite possibly had intercourse w/] your girlfriend, but you can put her back together assembling the machine Frankenstein has created.Quirky little story that's interesting, but too short to matter much. You revisit each scene[about 15 rooms] atleast 2-3 times. I did enjoy how emotions were conveyed and how a you could somehow communicate with a brain. Would've been more interesting if the GF turned out to be Frankenstein as a small twist."

,Recommended,493580,32892422,Posted: 27 June,all,txernest,"I love HOGs, and I play a lot of them, so I bought this pack when I was running low on new adventures in this genre and wanted some more. Each of the games in this collection takes about an hour and a half, although they range in quality. Some of the games have far better interface than others and there are certainly some 'duds' in the writing department.If you find this pack on-sale and love HOGs, it can certainly be worth the money. Most of games aren't as interesting as many of the other HOGs around Steam, but for the most part they were rather enjoyable."

Some of the items you have to find are so small that, even when zoomed in, they're difficult to see. Item descriptions are inconsistent too. A drum could be an instrument, a petrol can or a barrel depending on who wrote that scene! I've also had to quit a couple of the games because they're broken and don't let you go past a certain point.It's a shame because they could be such good games, but trying to search for items the size of a full stop were giving me a migraine!"

Might be different on other systems (I'm running XP SP3 32-bit, and XP is listed in the system requirements on the store page), but I have no clues on what's causing the issue. Trying to search for a fix elsewhere online just led me to various other forum threads of the developers ignoring customers' requests for technical support."

Not the highest in quality, but they all keep the same level of elements, so if you like one, you like em all. I've enjoyed plugging away slowly at these games. I liked the ease of the hint system and found it overall challeneging enough for me that i had fun and only got annoyed once."

I enjoy not having to wait for your energy to refill or having to spend money to use hints. I have really enjoyed playing these hidden object games. I have only had to skip 2 puzzples."

For the price this isn't a bad buy and the games are pretty decent. If you're looking for something cheap and want to relax from tedious gameplay this is worth buying."
