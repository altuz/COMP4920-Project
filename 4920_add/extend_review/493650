It sounds great on paper, but the problems are.Too much screenshake, you touch one thing you are basically dead. Even if you turn screenshake off, it comes back after you are sent back to the main menu.Colour, the colour is so bad and you move too fast you don't even know what you are looking at or going to.Slow-mo, Slow-mo in a fast paced game sounds great. This ""slowmo"" however, slows you down so much, and lasts too little time, you can't do anything with it.I give this game a 1/10, I bought this game for 25 cents because I had a coupon. It is NOT worth it.My only regret is playing this game more than 10 seconds to write this **** review."

Achievements that never popped when I was playing it.TL;DR - ABSOULTE WANK"
,Not Recommended,493650,24666179,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,HotDoge,"The Deep Space Dash resembles games like F-Zero and Wipeout, but it's limited life per run, tremendous amount of death items, DirectX 9 like graphics (too dark and full of blooming lights) and ridiculous amount of camera shake makes it mostly irritating.The gameplay is fine to a point: it's simple. Use the A and D keys to move around, while the craft goes in a constant speed towards an endless tunnel with 3 lifes. Take little glowing orbs to score and one of the 3 power-ups spread in the scenario to assist you. But keep in mind that the points and power-ups are randomly distributed, so you can't memorize your way. Keep in mind also that the speed-up power-up makes the camera wobble; the more speed-ups you take, the more the camera shake. This also happen when you either hit a black barrel with red lights coming out of it, or pass over a death item, but in a not so smooth way, making the game impossible to see for a whole second, leading the player to another death item. Remember that I told the orbs and items are randomly distributed? Since this happen, sometimes the game put too much itens in your way (read too much death items), making it impossible to dodge those items. The tunnel mentionated earlier is narrow, dark and full of blooming lights. There are times that these lights match the color of the itens, leading the player to take it without knowing, or to see it with too little time to react and dodge.There are some minor problems also, like when you run out of lifes, you are presented with the main menu, instead to go back to the start line or be presented a restart prompt.The graphics are much like early DirectX 9 games (not the c version of the API), nothing special.This game has a great idea behind it, and could be a great time killer, but it is badly executed. I would not recommend something like this to my friends, even though it's cheap.TL;DR: The game has potential, but at the current state it's annoying. I don't recommend it.UPDATE: It seems the devs have realeased an updated with the possibility to remove the camera shake. It can greatly increase the ""enjoyability"" of the game, but I would still consider the shake with a reduced time, since it can help indicate when you hit something. I'd still not recommend the game, since it has more things to improve, but at least now it worth to try it."

It needs some optimization and the effects are a bit too much most of the time. I've also fallen out of the corridor my first run and I got stuck outisde of the map. When you lower the resolution there is no option for windowed mode as far as I could tell either. Other than that, the product is pretty good, just needs some work. I'm pretty sure I'm the first review so be sure to look for everyone else's reviews as well."

The game wants to shake the screen every time you pick stuff up in a game where sharp precision actions are vital, virtually breaking its own gameplay. This is just ONE of my complaints. ONLY unless you want this game because you won't EVER play it, like me, then get it at 50% off or even less than that."

This game really, really grows on you, it's hella addictive and the ardor of playing beats everything else tenfold. It might seem overly difficult at first, but as I kept trying, it got more and more interesting - give it some time, and you will come to realize that it's way more exciting than it seemed at first, and if you keep on dying every five seconds, you haven't got used to it yet. Practice makes perfect; I say it as someone who totally sucks at these kinds of games and yet managed to beat this one :DAnd the absolutely best thing for me, it's a game you can come to when you have some time to kill, but not nearly enough to engage in something more profound. You will have died five times already and started again in time that it might take some other games to reach the loading screen; it's fun, it's fast, it's a perfect choice if you're tired of everything else and want to switch your mind onto something different.One of the most unexpected finds on steam for me, and I'm ever so happy that I stumbled upon it.P.S.: Special thanks to the developers for being very friendly and helpful! Seeing your feedback really made the game look even more appealing and sweet, at least for me :) Can't wait for the achievements now!"

I did not enjoy this game."
,Not Recommended,493650,24443757,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,Fenrakk101,"This game is not ready for sale. The graphical comparisons to games like Race the Sun are absolutely undeserved, it's just a bunch of neon-smeared models on neon-smeared levels with tiny neon icons littered around that you need to collect, except for the indistinctly different neon icons that kill you on contact. And if you get motion sickness, avoid entirely; the camera spins around like it's mounted on a bobblehead, which gave me a headache in five minutes flat. The menus are also neon blue, and as you can see in the screenshots, there's no adjustment for the neon-blue level. Also notice how all of the important information like lives, score and timer are littered all across the screen, as far away as possible from each other and from the level itself.Even if the game's visuals were handled adequately, the controls are ridiculously sensitive; your ship zooms from side to side at the tap of a button. The ""maze"" mode is just linear corridors where you have to press a different set of left/right buttons to turn, and hope that there's not a deadly neon icon right where you end up; assuming the game registers your button press (which it often doesn't). And again, if you have motion sickness, I doubt you'll enjoy the camera teleporting to a new position at every turn. It's also completely unclear how big your ship's hitbox is, so you'll phase through some pickups and hit others with no discernable consistency. The achievements also seeem to be completely broken.I try to ""finish"" games before I review them, but this was unplayable. I never thought I'd regret a 10-cent purchase, though honestly, my time spent on it was the real loss."

I would be more open-minded if it was being developed but the devs seem to have dropped this game from any further updates having made one patch right after release. I only own this because I had a 90% off voucher.- The UI is bad- Steam achievements don't work- Menu looks like it was made in MS Paint- The screen shake renders it unplayable (Can be turned off in settings but...)- Settings don't save between plays- In Maze Mode you can't turn (You can only strafe)- You can barely see if you've gotten a powerup (Good or bad)- The slo-mo powerup grinds the game to a near halt- Asks me to connect VR despite the fact this game would probably cause a seizure in VR- Horribly optimised+ Trading cardsWould not recommend to anyone who can't get this game for £0.08 or less
