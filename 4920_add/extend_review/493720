(I played MYST, Riven, Exile, and the others.) I bought this game right away. I finished it in one sitting. But it falls short in crucial ways. I cannot recommend this game -- at least not at full price.The GoodLooks like MYSTSounds like MYSTFeels like MYSTSome puzzles are elegant and enjoyableThere are hints of an interesting storyThe BadDoesnotplay like MYSTSome puzzles are profoundly inelegantWithout the walkthrough on the forums, I would never have finishedNumerous objects with which the player interacts have no clear connection to the goal (switches with no on/off indicator, levers pointing to unclear targets)The written notes are choppy and unsatisfying (the choppiness may be a translation problem, but the extreme brevity and shallow story are not)The locations in MYST have cupboards and drawers and books, all of which can be explored. This game has cupboards and drawers and books too -- butnoneof them can be exploredTravel seems like it will be speedy, once certain steps are taken. This never happens -- going from one place to another is tedious until the very endThe intentions behind several objectives are unclear; as a result, the ending is very unsatisfyingI don't wish to be overly negative, because I have tremendous respect for the developer -- again, his love for MYST is clear. He's done a fine job with the visuals and the audio, but the deeper problems of puzzle creation and world interaction leave me annoyed and unhappy.If you think I'm just dumb (which is, of course, possible), and/or you love the MYST series enough to try this, please wait for a sale."
,Recommended,493720,24190146,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,b1uecat,"TO GET WASD MOVEMENT: the keybind menu is in the Unity launch window.  The Unity launch window is that first window that opens after you launch the game from steam, where you then hit the ""Play"" button to start the actual game.  To add WASD movement, just click the ""Input"" tab, and then double click the appropriate cell in the ""secondary"" column for the direction you want to move, and type the key you want to  use to move in that direction.  There is no keybind section of the ESC menu while in game.  WASD has been around for decades, it's a little frustrating to me when a game does not enable this by default.Hold down the SHIFT key to sprint.The game defaulted to 1024x768 screen resolution for me, which was pretty blocky, so if you start the game and it doesn't look like the store page video did, you can increase the screen resolution in the Unity launch window, before the game starts. The game looks pretty good at high resolution, although the framerate is a little choppy when spinning the view.  I don't have framerate problems in other games.  Maybe this will be improved in a patch.  It's not bad enough to bother me so far, just enough that it looked slightly jittery when I turn the view around quickly.The game appears to have four ""islands"" total, so it does not seem to be only the one island you see in the promo video--there appears to be more content.  The puzzles (that I've seen so far) do seem like the old myst puzzles.  The music is nice, and the game has a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere.  The default control is to move forward with left mouse button, and backwards with right mouse button, however you interact with things in the world with left mouse button too, which I find a little irritating, because it causes you to move around while you are trying to click on things, but this is a minor beef.This game is apparently the work of a single dev, so as with Banished, Beseige and numerous other single-dev games, this effort deserves some props on that score alone.The ESC menu has a ""Readme"" button that contains credits and a short message from the dev, a ""Restart"" button to restart the game, and a ""Quit"" button to quit to desktop.  There is no save game, load game or options in the ESC menu.  There is some quick reference info on the default controls.Thumbs up from me at this point, however if I come across serious issues with the game, I'll come back here and revise this review."

I've visited three of the four islands in my hour with the game so far, and they are very tiny with very few interactive elements. That's not to say the game isn't worth it. It's quite cheap and clearly a passion project, and a lot of love and care has gone into this game.However, my own personal experience has been marred somewhat by several bugs. I've fallen through the floor numerous times, which reset you at the starting island. Additionally, I have also accidentally glitched through doors while examining them, which cause very confusing sequence breaks.I'll check it out again in a while after some patches, but for now I will give it a pass."

You can definately tell the developer was inspired by those two games.  You arrive on an island very much like in Myst, not knowing how you got there.  You must move around the island and discover its history.  I don't want to spoil any more of the game but it definately will scratch the itch of anyone that grew up with Myst and Riven.Also has pretty good graphics for a Unity game."

Yes it is.This is doubtless the most impressive One-Man-Project I have seen for a very long time. If you are a fan of the ""Myst"" you will like Haven Moon very much. Another point which should be not taken for granted is the graphic design&quality, which is on quite a high niveau, especially if you consider that it is a single mans work. Even if you are unimpressed by the graphics and the well tought-out leveldesign, the OST/Sound is something that immediatley draws attention. Not only the musical pieces, but also the ambient sounds are easily able to compete with more popular games. Last but not least: The Gameplay itself. The puzzles are enjoyable and doable, the overall course of action is also quite elaborated. I do not want to spoil the story to much so I'll just leave it at that.I really enjoy playing this game and hope that we will hear more from the games developer. I hope this review helped you.Sincerly,Aspen_"

I'm always on the lookout for a good Myst-like game, unfortunately, Haven Moon falls well short of being a great game.  All of the elements are there but they're not utilized to their full potential.Pros:-Graphics are very well done-Several puzzles to solve-Like Myst, you must pay attention to detail-The description says “point and click” but I would classify it as a 3D adventure-The controls are as simple as it getsCons:-The environment (islands) are much too small-Not enough clues to solve some of the puzzles-Needs more puzzles-Some of the key holes are hidden (Oh joy, pixel hunting)-The game is much MUCH to shortAt the time of this review, Haven Moon was selling for $14.99... is it worth it?  Not by a long shot.  Even without the cons I just listed, it's not worth it because of how short this game is.  I would say $4.99 is closer to the mark, so if you really want to play this game, I'd wait for a sale.With all of that said, I'll have to give Haven Moon a Thumbs up since I did enjoy this game more than not."

For a game that is born from a love for myst, it completely misses the point. In stead of trying to puzzle together what happened, who you are and what you are trying to do, everything gets presented on a platter in the form of notes, clearly steering you through the game. The puzzles can be fun, but some of them were difficult for the wrong reasons, like pixelhunty/partial solutions accepted, which made it hard to really enjoy this game. It is very pretty, but I ended up more frustrated with it than having fun."
,Recommended,493720,24223565,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,ArizonaTea,"As mentioned in other reviews, it has pretty clear traits of Myst, which is good. The game's progression is steady and the puzzles aren't too hard overall, but as another reviewer stated some are confusing simply because a lever or button in one place will impact somewhere you would least expect to look. While it's fun to find these places, it becomes a little difficult when traveling back and forth requires a loading screen each time. Overall this isn't too big an issue.The storyline is interesting if not a little short. More closure at the end would definitely be nice or some more notes delivering some more aspects of the story. For the duration of the game (3-4~ hours) it's good enough though, and if you like story-driven puzzle games I'm sure you'd like Haven Moon."

The world was beautiful, the story interesting (still hoping for a DLC or a sequel to find out what happened to the mystery man who built the place) and most of all the puzzles were great. In several places they baffled me, but upon figuring them out I not only felt satisfied but also impressed at how cleverly they fitted together. I would highly reccommed this to anoyone (Myst player or not) who has the patience to sit it out, I can tell you its well worth is (and for less than 20 NZD, a bargin).Do not expect Myst, it is not Myst and only Myst will ever be what it is, but of all the games I've looked for to play after Mysts conclusion this comes closest. And for one guy, developing by himself for 20 years, I'm floored at how well it came out. My hat is off to the developer, and I hope any prospective player enjoys :)"

Anyway, up to this point I've played 4 hours 56 minutes, all in one sitting.Dear developer, thank you very much for making this game. I really missed this kind of a games, where you are alone in peaceful place, and scenery in this game is breathtaking.Also, I really wanted to fix my big mistake in childhood - completing Myst and Lighthouse with walkthroughts. And this game is a perfect opportunity for this :).Anyway, here comes a bit of review in my review. As I mentioned, this game has a peaceful and calm atmosphere, and almost in all locations you can just stop and watch the scenery. I think I'm close to completing this game, and I didn't experience any slow-downs or bugs.If I'm correct about nearly reaching the end of the game, then I have only two complaints. The first one is that this game is a bit short. But maybe I was just tranquiled by the game and didn't notice the time passing.The second one is a mistake in Russian translation in one of the papers, when it tells you about beacons. It says ""fragments"" instead of ""flashes"".I was lucky and managed to accidently solve one or two of puzzles that I could spend a lot of time solving. For example,The place where you find the key to the house. I was curious if I could fall there, and panicked a bit because I had no idea how to climb back :D"
76561197981762471,Recommended,493720,24531020,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Cyion,"I just finished playing Haven Moon and I was very pleased with it.  It is heavily inspired by the classic games Myst and Riven.  It has its own story and does not borrow from the Myst storyline.  The game is designed with the outmost attention to detail.  For example, every swinging door has a hinge on it, the steps of a staircase are bolted to the frame, the size of the environment is scaled right, etc..  The soundtrack and sounds are high quality and the puzzles were fun to figure out.  If you are new to adventure/puzzle games, I would recommend that you pay attention to every detail while looking around each island.  Do not cheat yourself by looking up an answer in a walkthrough video, use your thinking cap and bring your magnifying glass (metaphorically speaking) and observe and think your way through each puzzle or area.  It is very rewarding to figure out the puzzles without help.  Also note that the game has a good and a bad ending so make sure you try both, it will let you try both endings without having to restart the game from scratch.  I am a huge fan of the Myst series so I enjoyed this game immensely.  One caution:  the game gave me headaches at times if I played too long, I have to close my eyes when using the teleporter as this accelerated me getting a headache.  Now you might not have that issue at all however, just a heads up.  I also set movement to the WASD keys and this made playing the game easier.  For myself I rate this game a 9.5/10."

,Recommended,493720,24640430,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,RoninOtter,"The short of it:  Haven Moon is a relaxing diversion into a visually pleasing world.  It's almost criminally short, however, and at times its puzzles can be a little obtuse and arbitrary.  I give it a thumbs-up because it matches the description in the store, kept me entertained for a time, and is quite an impressive game when you take into account that it was the product of a sole contributor.The long of it:The environment and buildings have obvious nods to Myst and Jules Verne.  In particular, the influence of Myst is incredibly strong.  Gameplay elements such as powering things up before you can solve their puzzles, traveling between small, isolated environments using fanciful means, and deciding on an ending once you've collected everything all make appearances.  For those who enjoy a world that itself is a puzzle, rather than a world that happens to have puzzles in it, by and large this fits the bill.  The locations have matching music that subtly adds to the mood of each space, and I believe a lot of people would want their interior decorator to take inspiration from the places you visit while playing.There are some minor technical hang-ups which can take away from the experience somewhat.   For instance, the Unity graphics engine isn't terribly efficient, causing some areas to lag in framerate despite simplistic environments regardless of how impressive your gaming hardware.  There are also numerous spelling errors in the written pages and even signage in the game, which may be due to translation issues, but when ""Canon"" and ""Cannon"" are used interchangeably more than once, there clearly needed to be some extra proofreading done.Outside of more nit-picky things like the above, the story itself is very minimalstic and not particularly well laid-out.  You only gain understanding of what's going on in the larger world through the written pages you find, which unfortunately have signficiant plot holes which leave much to be desired in terms of working out what your role is as the player.  The game's moral lesson is simplistic, and and clearly designed for kids. This on its own isn't bad, and the fact that the game has no violence or visible death means it's a safe one for the kiddies to enjoy.  (Granted, there is reference to the island creator's world being destroyed, but we never find out how or why, nor is there any real gravity to this knowledge since it is literally only mentioned once in a single sentence.)My only other gripe is with some of the puzzles.  Some are incredibly easy to the point of being almost a joke, while others are frustratingly difficult because of arbitrary and inconsistent ""rules"" of the universe which the game's creator has written but decided not to tell us about.  The most frustrating of these is at the very end of the game, where a previously consistent coordinate system was suddenly in total violation of all laws of geometry.  In addition, the maps of where the islands are located are disappointly meaningless, since their relative positions have no bearing on where they're pictured cartographically.This is a fun one for younger audiences and can keep an adult busy for a few hours.  It's not mind-blowing, nor is it perfect, but if you're in the mood for something casual, relaxing, and ultimately not very challenging that can distract you for a short while, Haven Moon is precisely that."

As it promises, it's very relaxing and serene while also being challenging but not to the point of being frustrating. The game is very visually pleasing and heavily stylized, something I'm sure any Myst fan will appreciate.If I have to pick a few critisizms it would be the controls, which are really bizzare at first but in the game's defence I did get used to it after a while and if you really don't like it you can just change it through Unity.The other thing would be the length of the game, I finished it in just under 3 hours and got stumped many times along that journey. However this really isn't uch of a critisizm since the game doesn't have much of a price tag and was made by one guy.Speaking of which, the effort and attention to detail and the labor of love that went into making this game very clearly shines through. François Roussel, if you're reading this, thanks for the awesome game and thanks for bringing back such fond memories of Myst."

Everything has been balanced to provide a relaxing experience and pleasant time spent in an imaginary world.""The fact is that the hardest part of the game is pixel hunting for interactable objects.  Beyond that, puzzles consist mostly of guess and check.  Very few of the puzzles are well designed.  The game took me just under three hours to complete...just long enough to not be able to get a refund.  Also, since the only saving is autosave, I would have to replay the entire game to see the alternate ending...or I could just youtube it.

The graphics are beyond stunning, and capture Myst's apmosphere perfectly while also having a little personality of their own.  Though the game is relatively small and short, it doesn't overstay its welcome.The one criticism I have of this game is that some of the puzzles are unintuitive.  If you're the sort that enjoys solving puzzles on your own, be aware that you're going to have to break out a guide once or twice.  There's no shame in this, and once you see the answer, you'll likely think ""oh, yeah, I wouldn't have gotten that.""If you think you'll like the game, I encourage you to try it... you're in for a real visual treat!"

If it was priced more to its playtime and story and not to its beauty, I would give it a serious thumbs up. I feel like it is a stunningly beautiful person (in my case a woman) who lacks any personality worth mentioning. Great to look at but will not keep your attention beyond a few hours. It is very Mystesque but lacks Myst’s depth, story immersion, and length. Actual casual, non-rushed, and lazy play time is 5 hours (possibly less for others). My time played says 14 hours, however I spent more than half of my time on projects in the house or watching Netflix, but did not exit the game, I just left it on the ESC menu. While the story concept is fairly good, but it lacks any real depth. The story part of this game is in written notes, and there are not very many to read.  As with all Adventure/Puzzle games replay ability is minimal at best so such a short playtime is very disappointing. When I read the Dev’s comment “It is neither too long nor too short”, I thought to myself “well then I should be able to get at least a good couple of days out of it. Not just a few hours. To sum up, the game itself is good but I cannot recommend at its current price due to lack of content. I would rather pay more for something more developed and not just a beautiful painting.Pros•	Very beautiful graphics and well-designed areas•	Decent puzzles overall•	Good story concept•	Thank god the option to change input for movement is available in the Input tab where you chose resolution•	I highly recommend the game itselfCons•	the left-click to move forward was horrid•	A few of the elements and puzzles like the teleport key could use better wording or a little more description•	A few elements need animations added because it made it impossible to know if they were functioning•	Story lacks depth and is too short to develop any connection to your counterpart•	Way too short•	Price too high for what you get (even on sale at U.S.$13.49 (-10%))"

The satisfaction you feel when you solve it on your own is huge.I've played and enjoyed Myst-like games for decades. I only recently heard about Haven Moon so I had no expectations going in except that it was supposed to be a Myst-like game. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a nicely designed and cohesive game taking me right at 16 hours to complete. Is it perfect? No. I'd definitely recommend some improvements if I were beta testing it, but I feel it's a good game overall.I almost always need a walkthrough for at least one puzzle in adventure games. This is the first adventure game in years that I was able to complete without any help from a walkthrough. The puzzles do require some patience, but patience is essential for Myst-like games just like fast reflexes are necessary for FPS games.I did have to take two breaks from the game when I got stuck on puzzles. One puzzle solution came to me as soon as I returned to the game after an overnight break. I had simply made an incorrect assumption instead of just following the evidence presented to me. The other solution occurred to me while I was doing something else away from my computer. I suddenly remembered something I had read in one of the game documents. I immediately returned to the game and solved the puzzle.Good things:The game definitely reminds me of Myst-like games with a touch of Jules Verne.The world created looks great and I loved all the working mechanical parts. Attention to detail is amazing.Puzzles aren't arbitrary. They actually make sense and are solvable without too much brain strain. Some just require patience and/or observation before the proverbial light bulb turns on.Documents/drawings contain all the knowledge necessary to solve the puzzles.Could use improvement:While informative, the documents are bare minimum and could use substantial expansion. On the other hand, because they're so short, you can be sure that the information provided is likely necessary to solve a puzzle somewhere so read them all carefully.Some puzzles could use a visual indication that the player has accomplished something (i.e. solved the puzzle).The English translation could use some polish."

In 20 years time I wouldhave expected a game that blows away Myst. The desire to create and the execution of that desire are two seperate challenges. I will give the developer credit for mimicking Myst from a visual aspect  but not from a story or puzzle solving aspect.There are just too  many puzzles that are left  to random solving  rather than logical conclusions based upon clues. That type of game structure justs wastes your time not your brain. It is also a very short game compared to Myst.

Myst and Riven are two of my favorite games so I was excited to explore another fantastic world.  François Roussel has done a great job creating a world that captures some of the look and feel that made Myst so appealing.  The visuals feel like something right out of a Jules Verne novel and look quite stunning.Like Myst, gameplay revolves around solving a series of puzzles and piecing together a narrative.  This is where I felt the game a bit lacking.  I really enjoy puzzles that I can think through and use observation to figure out.  The best ones (in my opinion) are seamlessly integrated into the story or environment.  While some of the puzzles in Haven Moon are wonderful, there are a few that are rather inelegant.  One puzzle in particular required me to enter a code.  I tried a few combinations before figuring I needed more information and continued to explore.  After a while quite a while with no progress, I broke down and consulted a walkthrough.  From the guide, I learned that the only way to progress would be to bypass the code through the brute force method.  For me, I enjoy puzzles that are difficult because they require acute observation, non-lateral thinking, problem solving, and resourcefulness, and not simply due the number of tumblers within the lock.  Another critique of the gameplay was how linear it seemed.While it has its faults, Haven Moon also gets quite a few things spot on.  One is its graphics.  The environment is stunning.  Everything has so much attention to detail, and are wonderfully animated.  I can’t tell you how many times I entered random coordinates into the telescope just to watch the dome turn.  (Seriously, the shadows, the reflections, the viewer, it’s that good.)  That said, I noticed a few areas where perforance was a little choppy.  I have a decent system, and since the islands are so small, my guess is a few objects have a bit too many polygons for their own good.  Its not horrible, but may impact players with lower end systems.  The sounds and music are also well executed.  The sounds are natural and the music, when present, definitely sets the mood for each location.  The story was interesting if short.  It left a lot of unanswered questions, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Who knows, maybe someday there will be a sequel (or prequel).  While not perfect, Haven Moon is certainly a fun game.  If you are a fan of Myst-type games, keep this one in mind."

If you liked the Myst series, you'll probably like this one as well, as it's quite faithful to the original.The Good:The visuals are downright excellent, considering the whole game was developed by one person. What an achievement!Both mouse and keyboard controls are easy and straightforward.The puzzles are challenging, but mostly fair.Captures the mood of Myst pretty well, being stuck in a strange place and having to figure out what has happened, how things work and what you're supposed to do.The Bad:The story is kind of bland, and there are no other characters at all.There's not much variety, both in the environments and puzzles.Some hotspots only become interactive once you have the right item. If you discover something too early, the game makes you believe that you can't interact with it.There's some pixel hunting involved, though usually there are enough clues if you pay attention.As mentioned, this game is inspired by Myst and Riven. So even though it may be unfair, I have to compare it with these games. And then it becomes obvious that Haven Moon lacks the imagination and variety of these games. Similar to Riven, it takes place on a couple of connected islands. But unlike Riven, these islands are pretty generic. History, culture, flora and fauna, all the things that made Riven and its puzzles so special, are missing. So in this regard, the islands feel more like Myst - more constructed than natural. But then Myst had a lot more variety in its worlds and puzzles. So while Haven Moon implements the Myst formula well enough, exploring the world is not as satisfying and rewarding.Having said that, I still enjoyed Haven Moon. It's a nice and challenging first person puzzle game with great visuals, and if you like this kind of game, then it's well worth its price."

76561198062483780,Recommended,493720,24276429,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,TheSixofClubs,"This is a puzzle game. That much is pretty obvious. I give credit where credit is due because it's an obvious homage to Myst, which is exactly what we were all expecting, right? The puzzles are right in the middle somewhere between too obvious and too subtle- most falling right in between and a few on each end of the spectrum. (Infact, if I didn't see on the forums how to power on the teleporters, I may have just quit playing the game altogether.)  For this reason, the challenge alone is why I recommend that you play it.BELOW ARE QUASI-SPOILERS!Here is my critique, however. This game reminds me of something akin to DLC for Myst. He created 4 more islands worth of puzzles that would have fit perfectly in with the island of Myst. I feel as if it wasn't until the end of his supposed ""20 years in the making"" that he realized he needed to create his own story.I am a huge Riven fan, and part of that reason is that even if you couldn't solve a puzzle, even if you couldn't figure much of anything out, you still wanted to play and explore the game because it had -character.-  Riven was a living, breathing world. It had ancient symbolism, inhabitents both human and nonhuman, it's locations looked lived in. It was organic.This game, for all it's success on the puzzle side, lacks any sort of personality. The clues and story all come from the same source- perfectly penned papers that are neatly displayed on a desk in each of the locations. It's bland, and if I have to be harsh to be honest- it's boring. Why lay the clues out so obviously on each desk? Why not hide the combination to the first door in the margin of a notebook, as you're reading the diary and sketches of this particular lone genius, who has a storyline perfectly tailored to make him a bit of an odd duck. With personality. Anything. Give the game some sort of memorable flavor.Now I understand that videogame creation is more work than I could ever imagine, but I feel like the content creation between a few pages of sketches and notes with the clues hidden within is about the same amount of man-hours as a perfectly placed piece of paper on the desk just spelling out the answers. If you're just going to leave the answer to the combination out on the desk, why even bother hinting at it? Why not just write the combination? WHY EVEN LOCK THE DOOR?!Ontop of the bad clue mechanics, the storyline itself is full of dissapointing holes and out-of-nowhere conclusions. For one, the scientist himself is a mystery- and not in the ""oh he's so mysteriously awesome"" kind of way. He completely lacks context. How did he get to the moon? Why was he the first? How did he build all of these buildings? Did he have a team? A lover? How did myself, The Player, come to be on this moon? The first note suggests that his teleporter scans the universe and brought me here, but you later find out that the teleporters only work if there are two identical pairs, right? So how did I get here? Where did the Scientist go? To a pulsating light and loud sound on the moon somewhere? Why not SHOW us that same anomoly at a certain point of the island and just not write about it?Also, and this is my last critique, the double ending. You can leave the moon in the Lab, or leave the moon with the gold. But... leaving the moon with the gold gets you a one way ticket to a lonely death?Where on Menra did this theme of ""right vs. wrong"" even come from? Was I supposed to be under the impression the whole game that my morality was being tested? Why did the multiple endings have such polarized consequences when there was absolutely no indication that my sense of worth was being questioned.So I use the teleporter in the room with gold, and you sentence me to a life of solitary confinement on an empty planet where I will slowly die from thirst and starvation?  Because I teleported from the room with the treasure YOU OFFERED ME?!  Look buddy- you teleported ME here... mostly likely against my will, and OFFERED me your treasure! Then you expect me to ""make the right choice""??   Nah. It feels empty to me.All of these questions and out-of-leftfield morality could have easily been addressed by giving more flavor to the notes. Make the pages of notes not laid out neatly. Make the player delve into the mind of this mad-scientist Tesla figure. Make the player AWARE that this scientist has a duality driven, unapologetic evil streak. Then I might actually be aware that there are consequences for taking his gold? Idk.Overall, it's worth the $14 for the puzzles alone. The graphics are wonderful, the music is serene, the sound effects are visceral. It was almost a good game and if you treat is as Myst DLC and aren't expecting a captivating story or theme, then by all means, enjoy the heck out of it."

With that said, I cannot recommend Haven Moon.  Yes, the graphics and rendering are excellent, and the music is atmospheric, if limited.   However, there is not much to hold this game together.  There is no culture or back story.  It's just a series of tasks to achieve a promised ending that I found to be anti-climatic.  I won't go into it because I don't want to issue any spoilers, but really, the end was an extreme letdown for me as was the alternate ending.  The games just stops in the same manner that it just starts.  It's more a segment of a larger game than a freestanding game of its own.    I found the islands to be far too similar with the exception of Cannon where the storm is raging, but even here, the interiors were very much the same.  Also, I guess I'm too much a fan of MYST, but I expect to be able to interact with objects in a setting where here, they're just decorations.  I also found that the controls were problematic, and although the movement didn't make me sick as it did others, I found it bizarre that using the arrow keys would not allow me to turn, only go sideways and backwards through a scene.  I love the puzzles of MYST and Obduction because you can ascertain what you have to do.  Here, there are things that have to be done that are totally cryptic and must be found by sheer luck as I did once or twice or by tedious repetition.  Where sounds must be used as clues when combined in games withing the MYST series, here, it's just find the sound and look for a few pixels with which to interact.   On the whole, it took me 4 hours to complete, and I really didn't feel as though it was worth the $15.  I wish I'd done what others said to do and waited for a sale, but I needed something to take my mind off of life for a little, and Haven Moon certainly didn't do that.
