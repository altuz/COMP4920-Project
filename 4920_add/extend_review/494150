76561198015748505,Recommended,494150,23988094,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,gessekai332,"As a person who did boxing as a hobby in college, I am very happy with this game and defintiely recommend it (especially because it is not a wave shooter like the rest of the VR games out there). I can block, bob and weave, counter punch when the computer throws punches (uppercuts, cross, hooks), so it's a great alternative to shadowboxing because you can practice defense at the same time. The blocking stamina mechanic is a good compromise so people dont cheese the system.However, since it is an early access game it is low on content (only one practice opponent and one real opponent), but I am sure the developer will add more soon since he has been very receptive to feedback and quick with his updates since his demo. The core mechanics are very solid and it is definitely worth the current price.EDIT: Adding a gameplay video of myself to give people an idea of what to expect.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1SnHwwtSrE"
,Recommended,494150,32740578,Posted: 24 June,all,Stal2k,"I've had about 5 years of combat sport experience. Full disclosure, it was MMA so that experience is more aligned with Muay Thai / American Kickboxing styles than classic boxing. While there are certainly differences between the styles, the 'feeling' of hitting someone in the face and emotions range felt during a match are probably pretty close. That being said I couldn't be happier to have something like this available.VR really opened the door to this level of immersion for sure, but all credit should go to the developer behind this. It's truly remarkable what he's accomplished. Getting the pacing and feeling of some of the nuances of the sport and actual act of fighting someone without actually having boxed himself is worth the price of admission alone.For perspective, I tried Knockout League and had to shut it off after the first fight for one simple reason; It committed the same sin virtually every other VR or motion controlled fighting game has before it.It did'nt take the user seriously, watered down physics that have more to do with a rhythm game or timing game on guardrails than a fight.Is ToTF perfect, the only thing missing is the concussion and black eyes? Of course not, but IMO it's leaps beyond anything else mechanically and ""experience"" wise. I know that is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but it's well earned for this title. For  example, even the 1st opponent takes me back to exactly what it was like to lightly spar with a training partner. Not too hard, not too slow, focusing on technique and movement.Pairing the current experience with a super responsive Dev, frequent updates that are almost always a love letter to the (active) community on the forums and you have a winner worth 3x the asking price. Personally, I can't wait to see where this game goes as we are treated to frequent and meaningful updates.Additional context, or to address some potential purchaser preconceptions:If you are looking into this as something to TEACH you to fight, I'll say this. It's not an instructional. HOWEVER. If you use some common sense, watch some instructional videos or books on the subject, you can ABSOLUTELY drill and refine technique and precision. This is valuable in a way that goes beyond pad or bag work as you can gauge actual distance and get used to 'picking apart' a defense. With the addition of the round system, it can also teach you good pacing. Just like real life, conserving your energy is a huge part of fight strategy.When I was actively training, I was unfortunate enough to be one of those people that felt bad for hitting someone too hard that I trained with. It's more common than you think, and with a game like this it allows you to get the 'feel' of things like (distance) timing and even evasion down without taking or doing any actual damage - except maybe to furniture or TVs if you don't strap in.The big exceptions to what isn't going to build good real world habits are some intermediate level footwork stuff like cut and gate steps based on AI tracking and/or play area limitations. You can still make these movements of course, but you don't get the same angles you would IRL if you really make someone miss. The only other thing this game doesn't do is actually hit you back."

In other words, as advertised, this game is presently low on options with only 1 full opponent (not counting the training partner and the practice dummy manager).   There is a lot of work ahead for the dev.... However, let's also look at it from the POV of what we have.- A serious fun arcadish boxing game?  check- A way decent level of presence?  Check (I swear when he gets right in my face, I HAVE to back off!)- A workout and a half in trying to down the opponent? Check!- A dev that has already shown an ability to listen and quickly apply some upgrades to key areas?  Check!- Ugly Joe ugly enough?  With the update, checkmate!Serious fun, superior to the initial demo in every way and well worth purchasing.  Some tweaks still needed to the sound department (I want to hear the opponent grunt when I land some decent shots!) and the aformentioned need for other opponents but superior boxing game is attainable here when we look at the initial effort.Highly recommended!"

I tried it when it first released and maybe there just wasn't content released yet, because I only remember fighting the trainer. At the time, I thought meh. Glad I came back to it, especially the day after a big content patch.I used to compete at a very high level in wrestling, and this game inspired the same feeling of dread where your arms are burning with lactic acid and all you want is a second to rest, but your opponent keeps coming at you and you have no choice but to fight. Between rounds I would return to my corner and gasp for air, praying that the minute timer would slow down.As I write this I am pouring with sweat. The first fighter got me huffing and puffing, but the second fighter made dig deep into my soul and muster every ounce of grit I had to win. Took me several attempts, too.Not only did it require a tremendous amount of physicality, but you quickly learn that it's not just about throwing punches fast and hard. You will figure this out right away when you find yourself unconscious.Soon I was bobbing and weaving, throwing combos, body body head, head body uppercut, and soon it was my opponent that was hitting the mat.I'm on the third opponent now and have realized that it's going to take a serious amount of skill and endurance to beat. I have my punch force on the highest setting, so I might be challenging myself more than necessary, but I love a trial, and boy does this game bring it.10/10 my new favorite VR game. So glad I gave it a second chance.  Especially with pool party season coming up."

It is by far the most nuanced boxing simulator in the world (not that there are that many).I've been playing this game for the past few months and it just keeps getting better and better.  It's so rare to have a developer consistently exceed expectations with every update.I wish there were a way to support the developer beyond the one time purchase of the game, but I think it wouldn't matter much to him anyway.

My second match however againts some Australian dude i think...i could hardly breath at end of first round, threw too many punches and ran out of energy.

Although the game is the most accurate ""boxing sim"" out there, I do not recommend this game to people who train boxing / kickboxing and want to use this as an alternative to home shadowboxing.Why? simply because you will hit your damn VR Headset everytime you cover your face with your guard up, since your ""virtual face"" starts where the front surface of the Vive is, so you have to cover your ""virtual face"" instead of your actual face, and that is not good for your technique. Otherwise, I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys fighting games and is reday to break a sweat.TL;DR: if you really are strict about your technique and want to use this as an alternative to shadowboxing, DON'T buy it. Otherwise, enjoy the game!"

I have a lot of experience fighting, as I am a mixed martial artist that has about 10 years experience.  This game is the most realistic fist fighting game I have ever played by a large margin.  free form fighting that relies on real fight timing and not some prescripted fight timing that was dreamed up for an arcade.  I watched some videos of some people playing this on youtube and if this is accurate, they should get their asses handed to them in the upper levels....flailing and no blocking.  dropping blocks, etc.  we shall see.  Good job devs in plowing new ground that the big studios would not have the Cojones to touch."

,Recommended,494150,29230652,Posted: 13 January,all,Anton - Viversion,"It's easily my favourite VR game at the moment. If you enjoy boxing or you want a great workout this game is definitely worth it.At the time of this review i'm on the beta branch for update #14 and it just lifts the game to a whole new level.Pros:+ Blocking and dodging feel great+ Countering after a block works very well+ The game runs flawlessly - no performance problems at all+ The face of the opponent deforms from hitsCons:- The hit speed is cappedThe developer has stated that he will add a ""fitness level"" option that will increase the force cap and enemy health. My opinion is that the force cap should be fully unlocked, but that may or may not fit the game.- The opponents are too easyI lost only once to the ""Blue Bomber"" and otherwise i breezed through them all in a single session. I understand that the game is balanced towards the average user that may not have trained boxing, so this is a minor issue. The (hopefully) upcoming feature that allows the fitness level to be adjusted would help with this of course.Great work developer! From all the VR games i've played (which is A LOT) - this is my favourite."
76561198042381435,Recommended,494150,34568390,Posted: 28 August,all,Robbin,"So this game starts you throwing punches at a bag and you can actually see the force. Really cool to see that you actually have a reason to throw real punches. Then I seen my trainer in the corner and I went ham on him. Tried real hard to knock him down. Gave him everything I got and had him wobbling.Anyway, did the practice fight then moved onto the first fight, already sweating. Bell rang and I went in throwing combos until I laid out my opponent. Knowing that punches register the force you throw them, I threw mine hard and fast.. When he got up I kept on him until the round ended and already felt my arms burning. Getting through a whole fight was easier said than done at this point. By the final round I couldn't keep my arms up. Now that is a shadowboxing workout.Final thought, don't waste all your punching energy on your trainers face before starting a fight."
76561197978759417,Recommended,494150,25281062,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,CupcakeValkyrie,"Pros: Provides a good workout and genuinely gives you a little insight into the concept of combinations, albeit in a somewhat glitchy way. Body blows can make your opponent drop their guard, and you can throw hooks around your opponent's guard.Cons: Defense is iffy at best. I've had opposing boxers repeatedly punch right through my guard, while their guard seems flawless. Also, the mechanics are a bit weak, as you can literally step up to your opponent and just start pounding on the top of their head with both hands, eventually knocking them out even if they're guarding.Overall: Not a bad game. Definitely a good workout, and I'm sure that all of its flaws are due simply to being an early access title. For what it is, it's worth the $10 price tag."

76561197992173446,Not Recommended,494150,29133256,Posted: 8 January,all,tbcivx,"I struggle to give it a bad review. I see where it is going, and it is the only game that I have seen in VR that is trying this, but anything that makes me rage quit I can't recommend.Too Easy: I plowed through everyone up to the blue bomber without ever being knocked down. The difficulty does not scale. The first opponents just turtle behind their gloves, and let you pound them, until they are unconscious.Too Hard: The blue bomber is a ♥♥♥♥ing beast. Even if I hit him twice as many times as I get hit, I can't hurt him. I have only managed to knock him down one time. The difficulty curve on this one goes from boring to unbeatable in one opponent.Blocking is Broken: Are you supposed to be able to block with the gloves? I do it out of instinct, but every time, old blue goes right through the block. I would test it with the other fighters, but they don't throw punches. This means the only thing I have left for defense is to dodge. So now I'm flailing my head around like crazy, feeling like an idiot, trying to not get hit.Fighter placement: This is probably my biggest complaint. I play on oculus, and I only have 180 sensors, so I have to be facing front in order for it to read my glove placement. It works on the startup when I step on the scale...it works when I spawn at the fight board... and then in the match, it spawns the fighter on my right, instead of right in front of me. so, I have to turn to my right to fight, but now my right sensor is blocked by my body. This causes my right hand to either not respond, or to just fly off into space at random periods.Crowding: If you watch actual boxers, they move in to attack, throw a few punches, and back out so they don't get hit. Old blue, and a few of the other guys move in, but they never move out. they just stay in the pocket, and either hit, or be hit. The problem is, I don't want to stay in there with them. I move back, and they follow. eventually I hit the wall, in reality. I have no way to circle around them to escape, so I'm just stuck there getting pounded on."

,Recommended,494150,34987744,Posted: 15 September,all,AlienHuntinYeti,"I feel the need to post a review on this game, mostly for anyone who has ""too high"" of expectations. Is this game perfect? No. Is it impressive? Yes. Is it worth $10? Duh. Hell, I'd happily pay $15, and reluctantly pay $20 for this. And I'm so freaking cheap it isn't funny.Come into this game knowing there's only like 5 fighters (I think. There may be more, I haven't even beat everyone yet). Don't expect there to be more. I'm not the developer, so who knows, there may be. What does matter is the fact that every fighter actually has a different feel. There could have just as easily been dozens of fighters with very slight differences, which is much lazier than what was done here and would appease anyone complaining about lack of content, but this developer decided on a quality product.The punch force? Not perfect, but damn if it isn't still impressive that you can punch air and the game calculates something plausible, and it works pretty well. Improvements here would be awesome, but unreasonable to expect.There are flaws of course. For starters, one of the first things I noticed is the fact that you don't really have a ""stance"". That said, these flaws are less ""the developer doesn't care"" and more ""these are the limitations with our current VR tech/dev budget/man hours"", and they are absolutely within reason and do not kill the experience.Don't go into this game thinking it's going to be a fun punching thing (like Punch-Out!!). Don't go in and expect this game to deliver the perfect fighting experience, THE definitive fighting experience for years to come (though it probably actually fits that description as of now). Go in expecting a fight simulation and a GREAT workout (seriously, my first time with this game beat my arms harder than actually punching a 100 lb bag repeatedly. This will EASILY not only replace, but kick the everloving s**t of of shadow boxing in your routine. At least, until you can honestly do 3x3 minutes rounds going all out with a minute break in between by yourself). This is a small game made by one dude or a small indie team or something, and it is impressive. Anyone who buys this game for $10 and decides that they haven't got their money's worth either came in with the wrong expectations or is just dumb. On top of that, the dev is very active still. I posted a suggestion on the forums at around midnight around here and got a reply within 5 minutes.tl;dr, Worth it. I'm excited to see where this game goes in it's early access state, but would still be happy if the dev came out tomorrow like ""Ok, it's done!"" and released it as is."

I hope the game continues to evolve and somehow the developer manages to capture the force with which you throw the punch so i dont feel cheated for attempting to box with good technique as opposed to some videos you see of people able to beat the oponents but with less than optimal technique.  Be prepared to get drenched in sweat if you go for a more proactive/aggressive approach. Love it.

,Recommended,494150,29918400,Posted: 14 February,all,Radiation,"Disclaimer: The only boxing experience I have was the one time I punched my friends boxing bag and sprained my wrist.Purchased my vive last week, set it up and decided to grab a variety of games to put it through its paces over the weekend. Thrill of the fight was something of a yolo purchase; I normally steer clear of anything sport related. However I figured the reviews were promising and I was interested to see how convincing a simulated face punch can be without concussions and stuff.Turns out simulated face punches are more than sufficient motivation to make me move my body to avoid the annihilation of my digital cartilage. As far as realism goes, i cannot speak from any kind of experience, however the domsthat i am experiencing right now is most certainly real.Further the facial disfigurement is a really awesome, the graphics are not exactly photorealistic, however the damage your oponent sustains from good clean hits really makes it feel far more realistic than the graphics alone would appear to convey. Its kinda quite confronting when your opponent gets up off the mat with a massive Jean Claude Van Damme forehead egg right where the hit that floored them connected.I rate it four and a half JCVD forehead eggs out of five."

You can do jabs, uppercuts, hooks and straight punches (also body shots) and there actually is quite a nice amount strategy involved in using different attacks as well between different opponents.I like the dodging and defending mechanisms. Blocking straights, hooks and body shots really require you to actively switch the hand positions and even though the headset is kind of ""heavy"", using head movement to dodge really works nicely as well. I can't comment much on the movement and leg work since I have limited space so that is important part of real boxing strategy which I can't test really well. This game does require quite a big space fully enjoy it, but even almost stationary boxing still works ok.There is a nice amount of variance between the opponent styles and their strategies also have been getting better with updates. Although maybe they are bit oo repetetive as after a while you might find some strategy which works kind of too well against them. But you can still add some challenge by just mixing your own game up a bit and not exploit the ""sure"" strategy.I didn't like having unblockable punches with one of the opponents. In the latest beta update his punches are now blockable and I find it much more enjoyable while still challenging. Although maybe unblockable punches would make for a nice mini game on top of the zombies and headless opponent. I did find that trying to use only dodging required a hefty amount of energy and it was a really nice workout!Overall, I feel this game captures the feel of boxing really well even at this stage while it seems that updates are still frequent.

Captures what it's like to actually spar quite well -- that said if you've never sparred or taken a boxing/MMA class of some kind I could see it being more frustrating if you're not familiar with the basics (e.g. keep your guard up).I did find I could cheese the fights by throwing left jab into right hook repeatedly.When you finally knock down your opponent it could feel more rewarding, currently they just sort of get back up right away and stare at you while the ref counts. That said it does feel good when you're almost gassed out and they do finally fall.You will want to get some replacement foam and/or the water proof cover for this game as it does a very good job of working up a sweat.When VR and full body tracking evolves more I would love to see this support muay-thai/kickboxing.

The added arms gives you advantage to block attacks, I like the new damage system being reduced when you partially block an attack, even using your arms. I was amazed how close to accurate your arms are at, though it needs some work according to the developer but I trust him based from my experience, it looks like it is heading to the right direction. Always remember to let the game calibrate your body to get proper proportions, also calibrate each time you switch the vive to another friend. Heavy punching opponents (There is a new guy who is like a heavy weight with heavy punches) are tougher to block, sometimes it requires 2 hands to block heavy shots and blocking using 1 arm/glove sometimes is not enough. Your arms and the opponents arms react like that of the game Fight Night series where it can tangle at some point but not to an extent and sill feels like arcade. The damage you can give now is based off the speed of your punch, it gets challenging and pushes your strength specially when you are already tired at some point.Early releases feels more arcade, this one still is but with a bit of realism, punches do not fully go through their heads depending on the strength of punch, it can still go through their bodies but sometimes it stops at some point, your arms/gloves might not be where they are but they are just only inches off and I like the feel and most of the time it is on point. Some might not like it, but I guess because it feels different, for those who haven't tried the game yet and go straight to beta, you will still enjoy even with the new changes, they have their equal ups and downs, it is still the same game, you will sweat a lot and have lots of fun doing exercise, this is the best exercise you can get whether you have boxing skills or not. I have some boxing skills taught from my grandpa and if you have, you will enjoy this game more because there are many areas in this game that applies to the boxing discipline, this is the best VR boxing you get, of course you can always exploit the game and beat the guys easy, as they have their technical limitations, part of the fun in the game is somewhat up to you, how you react and move yourself in the playing field, boxers will try this game and apply like they shadow box on real opponent, casual players will just barage the opponent as many hits as they can, if you are a fan of Fight Night series then this game is the closes VR game to that and of real life boxing.Recommendations- Option to adjust the starting point of your arms (shoulder) It looks closer to my head. Or overall manual calibration.- Improve opponents reaction when doing sidestep, they look dumb when I keep on circling them.- Apply illegal blow warnings (referee warning, kinda) when hitting at the back of the multiple times when playes go behind them.- I don't think the body works well unless we have sensors to detect, leaning forward does not work in this game as your body just moves forward like a hanging slab attached to your neck.- Maybe tweak the damage system to add more damage when countering their punches and less when opponents expect to be attacked or when they are in defensive mode. In real boxing you tend to get hurt more on punches you don't expect.- Maybe try to play with special punches, a charge punch by holding a button to charge it.- Add movement to characters to dodge your attacks, duck, lean way and moving back to lure you to an attack or sidestep and move away when hurt.- Add player knocked down on floor, not following the downed players body because this can cause nausea, maybe just put a downed players body on the floor and add Taunt animation on the characters taunting the downed players body, this will be more challenging and will provoke the players. It would be funny to have the player (John Doe) wearing a VR headset and holding the vive controllers with gloves getting knocked down on the floor."

It's early access and still needs some work to be truly great, but it's already fun. It is steadily getting updates and getting improved gameplay.This game will give you a good workout, especially if you aproach it like real boxing and move around and throw some decent punches. While not a simulation you will be doing all the same movements as you would in real life (assuming you put effort into it) so it's like an intense shadow boxing session. You don't need to be fit to play the game though and you can also play more casually.If you're interested in VR boxing I'd recomend this game, and you'll be getting a decent  workout while playing. Also while not exactly promised the dev is interested in adding multiplayer, so if that interests you it will probably be added at some point. There are some complaints I but I think the dev is working on most of them. Things also mentioned by others, like the punch force cap, which dev has said will be raised.Extended: Using new Beta.The game is getting better and better, it's now a much more authentic boxing experience, for the experienced boxers, let's not call it a sim, but it is a true boxing game now in my opinion. Power cap has been removed, opponents move more naturally and fight more dynamically. You can get flash KOs and one punch knockdowns. You can also be taken out very quickly yourself, so you have to think about what you're doing.The game mechanics have been tightened up so it feel a lot more real now, and it's more challenging, although it might still be easy for some (very few) people. You now get blurry vision when damaged which convey the damage really well, and is a good reprentation of being wobbled. Still no rounds but that is coming, and then it will be even better.

But before going in to detail about what I don't like, there is one feature that I love.I love the fact that the game measures your height to make sure that your opponents are scaled appropriately.  My favorite thing to do is to get on my knees during the ""weigh in"" process causing my opponents to be much shorter and easier to beat.What I don't like about this game.  For starters, for some reason all of the characters tend to stand too close to you often pushng me towards the edge of my playing area.  They need to learn to back off far enough to allow you to throw punches.  I hate that the characters are mute, making the VR experience very uncomfortable.  The physics and game dynamics feel very wrong.  I almost never feel like my punches make contact even when I've thrown a good right hook.  Since the game is so awkwardly silent, there should be added music in the background.  Anyway, I basically believe I'm getting my money's worth and seriously, get down as low as you can when you weigh in to make your opponents tiny.

The difficulty is varying a lot with different patches currently, but the dev has recently added a skill slider, so even novices should be able to enjoy it. The dev is also pretty responsive to users requests, so if you think something should be added, let him know.I use it for a fun workout, fighting 3-4 guys in a row.

With that said, what there is seems to be pretty good. Full disclosure: I used to do full contact fighting, sorta like MMA but before that became a specific thing, and used at different times boxing gloves and juijitsu gloves. Overall things feel pretty good. You hold the controllers in a way that makes sense for this context. The opponents are really easy, but it gives you a little workout since they block just about everything unless they're hitting or about to hit.There isn't that much of a sense of actually making contact though, outside the sound. I dunno if it's the shading/lighting or what but it's hard to tell if I landed something (the lack of animation on impact has this effect as well). Body shots don't get any response unless they KO the guy, but the guys KO with the same animation as if you clocked him on the jaw. The characters aren't the most realistic looking, their physiques are kinda weirdly shapes, but it's good enough. I think the dev should look into the NVidia funhouse demo where you punch the little wackamole kind of things. They felt much more real to hit due to their physics and reactions.I would like to see things like hit counts, %'s, some kind of indication of whether I'm hitting hard or soft (just base this off velocity I guess?), and better detection of whether the guy is actually blocking my strikes. Basically I'd like that as the player becomes a better boxer all around he's rewarded. If I can throw 200+ fast jabs/round, and target them through his guard, that'd be nice to get rewarded for. The motivation would be there to become genuinely stronger/faster, so you can overcome the tougher opponents. That'd be truly unique."

I should be able to throw as many shots as I want if there are openings. Having to dodge first then attack gets old and predictable.When you hold the guy, the controllers should vibrate to let you know the hold is locked in.Make it more organic and not so cut and dry with the movements.All in all this can be one of the best VR games to hit!"

Now at update 4 I'm in a position where I am comfortable to recommend this as a early release ""game"", not because it is the only boxing game, but because its actually fun to play.As of update 4 everything has much more weight, like I'm connecting to something and that something is reacting to me, that been a forceful haymaker to the gob.Of course its far from perfect yet, still a little stiff, but its at a point where its satifsying enough to make it my go to high intensity boxing workout, I'm ducking and weaving and occassionally doing my best Kenshiros Hokutō Hyakuretsu Ken (North Star Hundred Crack Fist) attack.

There is some level of telegraphing as you'd hoped which is great.The play format at the moment is just choose a opponent (who has a particular style) and then engaging in robust gentlemanly discussion until someone kisses the mat 3 times. There is no campaign or real progression system currently besides unlocking a new fighter as you beat the previous (up to 4 as at writing)The sole developer also appears to be active and engages with users.

It has transformed an initial ""Wi-Flail"" till you or the opponent drops, to a much more nuanced game. One with satisfying risk (physical exhaustion) and reward (the bruised raisin of a plum headed opponent) trade-offs.The beta updates have provided an amazing glimpse into the inner-workings and future mind-map of the developer.

It was also a great workout, which is one of the things I am looking for in a boxing game.

,Recommended,494150,33397401,Posted: 9 July,all,Oxegen,"This game a lot of potential, but not quite there yet.The harder/quicker you punch, the more damage you do. Hit them in certain areas of the face, will make them flinch & lose balance, audio and/or vision. The same goes to you!My only critisism of the game is when sparring with an opponent, you can beat them bloody, i'm talking eyes swolen shut, teeth hanging through their nose, you barely get a scratch and at the end, it's a draw! wut?*UPDATE*Figured out why to the above. If you don't calibrate the gloves correctly, exactly to your hands, you think you've landed a full punch, when infact you've just lightly jabbed. Recalibraiting fixed these issues and the game is once again very well made/done.9/10"
,Recommended,494150,31872848,Posted: 20 May,all,Captain N,"UPDATE:This game has changed A LOT. If you haven't played it in a while you need to try it again. It's much more realistic and very difficuly. This is shaping up to be a series boxing sim.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This game is great for cardio. It's like shadowboxing with a robot. The graphics are good. The mechanics are satisfying. Super easy and quick game to jump in to.I hope to see more characters and a better flow of difficulty. I would like to see a progression like the old NES ""Punch-out""."

I am sweating balls, my upper chest is more wet than the panties at the juntin bieber concert. And i must have torn a muscle because holy bejesus, my arms were killing me for 3!!! days. It was insane. My girl asks to pick water packs from the trunk of the car. Sorry babe, i reply, i am a boxer know, can barely hold a glass of water.Ye the game is good."
76561197970970969,Recommended,494150,34712074,Posted: 3 September,all,Battlestar,So far so good. It is a fun workout.What the game is missing yet is some feedback. Right now for those of us that are not boxers it's more of a brawl. And if you don't win by knockout it's hard to say weather you did anything right. A training mode that might actually teach you some technique would be nice.

(But in a good Way)It took a while to set up room scale to get the view correct. I was waaay too close to the other boxers at first and had to take 2 steps back to be comfortable. That is honestly my only complaint. I figured out how to change views in steam VR setup, but it would be nice to have that adjusted in the game settings. The hit tracking is very good, ducking weaving a blocking is right on track. I fought the first 4 opponents in an hour and they are all challenging. They each have different strengths and some suprises in the randomness of the AI which is great. This game is worth 20 to 30 dollars to me at the moment!!! With further improvements I could see this being worth 50 bucks in the enjoyment and excersize it offers."

Early impressions, but this game feels like a lot of fun and serves as a good, intense workout as well. Immensely satisfying and physical."

However, if you want to use VR as a means to get in better shape then this is a must buy.  6 rounds a day will definitely get you a solid workout."
,Recommended,494150,34811558,Posted: 8 September,all,LionHeart,"Don't anyone take this THE definitive review or anything, but after having this game for just a couple of hours I feel like I've already got my money's worth. I am EXHAUSTED. So far I've only fought the first guy, and I couldn't believe how much punishment he can take. I must have knocked him down half-a-dozen times before finally getting him on a TKO in the third round. In real life I'm a very hard hitter, but I'm also not a boxer so for all I know, that's to be expected.This game has massive potentional, and exciting possibilities in the realm of virtual fitness, not to mention training for real boxing, which I hope to be doing in the near future. I wish the developer all the luck in the world and I'm glad be supporting his project on the ground floor, so to speak"

,Recommended,494150,34864655,Posted: 10 September,all,Mazer Reck'em,"This is an absolutely fantastic game. It is the best at making you feel present in the virtual world of any of the VR games I have tried. Additonally, from both my own experience and conversations with others (who have much more real world fighting experience than I do) who have tried the game it is very close to the real thing- probably as close as VR can get. Would highly reccomend."
,Recommended,494150,35046449,Posted: 18 September,all,Rocket Redfern,"this game feels like im putting on the gloves and squaring up for real -the hit box detection and motion control is unbelievable. thrill of the fight is bloody hard, but makes you feel like a bruiser if you can last 3 rounds.i just had a shower after being knocked out in the 2nd round vs ugly joe, and i actually gave him a shiner this time imagine the blood rush if they made this multiplayer, and you could hear the other guy/girl trash talking you 5/5 (im not sure if getting what i wish for is psychologically healthy)"

,Recommended,494150,35071883,Posted: 19 September,all,TinyPeenPeen,"Initial thoughts: Awesome job, this game is dope. 9/10 score.Thoughts: The only thing I'd like to see in future updates is more response from the opponent. I can literally stand there with my face out and hands down and they don't do anything for a long time, sometimes long enough to where I get bored trying to get them to swing and I just hit an opening. If you could have an opponent with a ton of stamina and the ability to be a stinger and throw tons and tons of punches that would be awesome. Also, they don't utilize combos too well, like a simple 112 or a 123. It'd be cool to have an opponent throw out a 1234 or a 5634 every once in a while.Conclusion: Awesome game and incredibly fun. Could use fine tuning though, as a novice boxer could easily plow through all opponents. That's fine since most people who play this probably will know little to nothing of boxing but at least have one or two guys in the game that are really ♥♥♥♥ing hard and would require experience and knowledge."

76561198057055742,Recommended,494150,35068036,Posted: 19 September,all,AlexZ-_-Z,"It's not a big polished AAA game but it's still entertaining.As expected from early access, there are some bugs and weird things going on with your gloves and enemy position during the fight, but nothing that breaks the game so nothing major.Something i did not like was the fact that hitting the enemy doesn't feel satisfying enough.It feels like I can throw the slowest punch or hit the hardest I can, either way the animations and sounds will feel about the same.a bit like like punching a wall, but even the wall will make a louder sound if i hit it harder.The effect of being hit is also not good enough in my opinion, the screen simply blinks white.Maybe there should be a little dizziness or a little movement against the side where i've been hit or a little black markon the screen at the area where I've been hit. I don't really know, but the white screen feels like a quicksolution but not good enoughOther than that, compared to what other VR games have to offer, this game offers a great experience.My entire family tried it and everybody liked it and were really excited.This game is an example of what VR has to offer and shows the potential of what we'll be seeing in the future.What really makes it so great is the fact that it's a super fun exceirces.If you're not in shapre, You'll be sweating and hurting after a couple of rounds."
