,Not Recommended,494230,25818491,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Aeternull,"I just completed the game, collecting all the achievments.The game was good and it had its memorible moments. It made me laugh here and there. Felt sad on couple of scenes. Loved some of the characters. And I had fun playing it.... for a bit.I really wanted to recommend the game but I couldn't. Even with all the great, there are two bad things in this game that, for me, completely overshadows the good ;(The game is very very repetitive and very long... and the mixture of long and repetitive is thr worst! It has 90 stages. 60 being Story related and the remaining 30 are meanigless extra stages that serve absolutely nothing and adds nothing more than 'game time'. After completing about 20 stages, you will start to realize the game is the same as how you started. Doing the same thing except with different colors and different rooms. It turned into a chore game and became very tedious to play.It took me 13 hours to finish it. 13 hours of doing the same thing over and over again, it was annoying but I went through it just for the sake of finishing the game, seeing the end, and getting 100%. But you might be wondering, what was it that I did over and over again. I'll tell you. It's like this:-Patient comes in-You click on patient and then click on here he/she needs to go-Onece the patient reachs the place. You give them an item or do a small mini gameThose 3 lines ares exactly the entire gameplay. The entire 13 hours of gameplay I had :<Everything else was fine. Story was okay. Music was normal. Character are good. Some twist in the story but nothing special. It just was too boring, and felt like a total chore game. And that's why I don't recommend it ;_;Hope this small review helps someone ^_^ Thank you for reading"
,Recommended,494230,32199108,Posted: 5 June,all,RipWitch,"At least things can’t get any worseIt is becoming common to see PC ports of console and handheld games. It is not surprising seeing to see mobile games joining in as well. However, there is a vast distinction between how they are treated initially. While console and handheld ports are only called out if the port was obviously not well done, mobile ports are almost instantly called out as being the worst. This can be the case, but not always. There are some great mobile games that made their way onto Steam, and Blue Giraffe’s games are one of them.Heart’s Medicine - Time to Heal, being the second installment in the series, brings us straight to a tense situation as you open up to a rushing ambulance. Joe at the wheel trying to drive in the rain while Allison tries to stitch up Daniel as Jenny tries to help. As Allison progresses in treating Daniel’s injuries enough so he can survive the trip to the hospital, the ambulance quickly loses control and plummets off a cliff. You are than left on a cliffhanger as it goes three months earlier to this scene.This opening easily sets up the type on tone you should expect and a literal cliffhanger that teases you to find out more. Before you do, be ready to learn what has happened that made it escalate, and it does not disappoint. We learn that Allison, whom the series follows, is starting as an intern in Surgery department. But the head of Surgery will not take more than one intern and the other intern happened to be there before you. Sadly, Allison has to wait longer to be in the Surgery department by starting at the bottom of the internship. Luckily this hospital does contain friends, so those who are teaching you already know you and bond even more. And well, all the drama would not be in your forefront as it builds up.With the first game not available on Steam, it does not seem like you need to play it to get what is happening in this one. As far as I could tell, the first game may of had why Allison decided to get into the internship and establishing the relationships between the characters.This is where the gameplay starts to help drive the story. The best comparison someone can make is to Diner Dash, as they both focus on your speed. As patients walk in, you need to see where they need to go, correctly assign them, and wait till they tell you what they need. Allison brings in her part as she needs to pick up items you queue up and walk to the patient to administer it. The items come in three categories: some are infinite no matter what, others you need to restock, and ones you need to combine items. As bonuses are included to how quick you are (quick assign, quick treatment, and treatment chain), this can easily throw you off. Especially first getting them and if it takes a while for Allison to pick them up, it can cause some quick treatments to be sacrificed. These treatments can also cause either a touch input, like sliding down a slider, or a minigame to be activated depending on the color of the quick treatment timer. Not to mention the treatments that do not need any input from you cost different amounts of time. There is a lot of learning you do without knowing so you can gauge Allison’s actions to get every quick treatment.Not to mention there are challenges in each level. One is to just find a guinea pig named Oliver whenever you hear the queue. The other is displayed on the top right of the screen. It can be story based or just something random that I can only imagine Allison doing as either a dare or to make her day interesting. A lot are time based, such as having to clean something up or to use an item within seven seconds of grabbing it, while others are numbers based, like get 15 hearts in this minigame. You do not need to do these challenges, as the story will still turn out the same, but they will give points that may put you over the three star mark. Once the treatment is done, they will be in line to get checked out where you can get a max of five people waiting to get a combo.I absolutely love the minigames. It gives another level of interactivity as you learn how to do it and try and find out how to do a shortcut. With only 10 shifts per department, not including the extras, you do learn fast as they spread out giving them to you. As you move departments, these minigames change to reflect what that department does. So the Pharmacy will have you find the correct medicine box while the Emergency Room will have you stitch up a wound. And man the sound design in these minigames makes it better.The point system is not for nothing as well, as with each star, maximum of three, you get 300 coins to spend on upgrades for the department. You do need to know that you will not get enough to buy everything before you leave. It is easy to spend it on upgrades immediately, but replaying it will make you more stingy. Trust me, you need to upgrade the last department.What stops someone from just sitting there the whole level? It so happens that they thought about this. It is hard to not get a single point. Even if you forgot that a patient wanted something or need to be checked out constantly, you will get points. Try and sit it out, and just get Oliver and maybe the challenge, it will know and make you retry it.Want more challenges? You’re in luck as there are specific challenge levels spread around! Most are just a harder challenge to do while some brings in Emily, from another series named Delicious Emily, so you can serve food in the hospital canteen. This lets you gain diamonds so you can bring in items to decorate an area of the renovated hospital and so you can get an achievement. Doing everything initially took me 11 hours to do, with the main gameplay taking around 7-9 hours, so the challenges can bring more replayability.What will happen in the next installment in the Heart’s Medicine story? How is Allison doing after her internship? What drama is going to follow? Answers reside in the next installment, Hospital Heat, which is out now.Overall+ Good storytelling, certainly went into the hospital drama well+ Solid gameplay that easily takes in casuals+ Great audio and music used+ Pleasing art style- Can be too repetitiveHeart’s Medicine - Time to Heal is a great casual game. The story providing the drama it promised while also bringing in those heartbreaking moments that always hit you even if you seen it before. The visuals certainly catches the eye as well, and became an easy way to pinpoint other games the same team has made. I certainly would not of found Heart’s Medicine on the app store and I’m glad it made its way to the Steam store."

See the thing is those ""free"" casual mobile games are not actually free rather then freemium. If you dont know what a freemium is feel free to check out myClover Tale Reviewon Steam as I described it in there.The Game itself is a mix between Greys Anatomy, Scrubs, Dr.House & Diner Dash Games. I personally fell immediatly in love with the Story and due to me liking casual Managing games I also loved the Gameplay.Thanks to Challenges and changing rooms this game will not get boring in any way. The Graphics are very simple so I am sure low end pc's or laptops should have no problems running it.There is no Voice Acting in this Game which personally didnt bother me, the atmosphere thanks to great music was regardless amazing.I probably must of cried a million times already because of how beautiful the story has been told.To my suprise the game also took me 10 Hours to complete (with a few challenges) and yet still it felt way to short and I would like to binge play it all over again.This Game is one of the few Gems on Steam especially Story Wise.I do recommend this Game to all Greys Anatomy, Dr.House & Scrubs Fans. I also do recommend this Game to all Achievment Hunters & I do recommend this Game to anybody that loves casual managing games or an amazing Story."

You can buy new furniture for the hospital, upgrade items in the area you are in and develop the story.The gameplay mechanics are fun albeit they do get tedious after awhile however the story progresses to another section of the hospital which will switch up the game a bit. If you enjoy story games with intermittant gameplay than this is definately for you.I was able to find enjoyment at it and I think the story is fun and interesting, which is perfect for what the game is asking for. The game also has a ton of levels which means that it isnt just a short quick story it is going to take awhile to get to the end, and I will definately be looking forward to playing more.Check out some gameplay if you are still looking for more information on how this game works!https://youtu.be/_S5_EELev-s"
,Recommended,494230,31949901,Posted: 25 May,all,Emzzibub,"Heart's Medicine - Time to Heal is an amazing game that i absolutely adore. As part of the Delicious Emily franchise, again you are brought back to the town of Snuggford where you will get to enjoy another piece of the series where most of the games are set, allowing you to fall in love with the town that little bit more.You star as Allison Heart, a new intern at the hospital who's eager to start her first day in surgery. The grumpy surgeon doesn’t want her around, however, so she has to work her way through other areas of the hospital before landing her dream gig. While she tries to repair her career, Allison meets and befriends several other doctors, interns, and patients, all of whom play key roles in the story as it unfolds.With minigames to play, upgrades to unlock, 90 levels and a few hidden secrets to boot, Time to Heal is great opportunity to flex those Time Management skills in a fun and enjoyable way.Heart’s Medicine - Time to Heal hits all the right marks for casual gaming perfection. The presentation is top-notch. Everything from the visuals to the music lends itself perfectly to a high budget release. The storytelling is handled remarkably well, building suspense with each short cutscene just like a television show builds suspense with episodes. You'll laugh, you'll cry and more importantly you should BUY this game and help the developers to continue making such wonderful, well created games."

As soon as I did, I bought it straight away. I was in love with the game, the music but mostly with the storyline. That's the reason I nominated this game for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award (november 2016).Basically you play as Allison Heart, an aspiring surgeon, while working on different departments of Little Creek Hospital. Starting at the Ward and ending up in the Surgery, you'll have 90 levels to play (60 + 30 bonus levels), helping patients by playing different mini-games (applying cream, stitching up wounds, setting bones and more). And don't forget about Oliver the Guinea Pig, the hospital's very own four legged escape artist. During this there is plenty of drama... a love triangle, an accident, death and much more.It could easily be an episode  from E.R., Grey's Anatomy or any other succesful hospital tv show.So join Allison, Daniel, Connor, Ruth, Sophia and everyone else in this second game of Heart's Medicine (and personally I hope that many more may follow)."

But really it's the story telling that makes this game so aluring. The subtleties in the character animations, the music, and even the plot all come together in a really well made package.The game is simple and well-executed, it knows what it is and performs beautifully in that scope.

XD The storyline is beautiful, and the soundtracks are breathtaking. I am not kind of player who pays attention to the music in the background in games and usually, I do play without the headphones on my ears but with Heart's Medicine, I took care to have the headphones on my ears nearly all the time so I can enjoy the beautiful sounds. ^^The storyline is very touching as well. I kept playing for hours straight just to find out how events unfold. Allison, the main character, is quite likable and nearly all the characters are lovable. Each of them had a special trait and was funny in their own way. There isn't a single one that you could have a grudge against, hmm well, maybe except for Daniel, whom I just couldn't like. lolBut yup, this one is definitely recommended. If you're into time management games, will enjoy a good storyline and lovely music, this one is for you. XD"

Definitely more challenging than Diner Dash series but less than that of Trauma Center. I picked up the game for it's promised original story that is well-written, and I wasn't disappointed. Sure, it's not as awesmazing as those story-rich games. But for a casual time management game? This is way above its peers as of now. So yes, I'm telling you, I love it.Easy to pick up mechanics and literally the same as all the other time management dash games if you've played before with the quicktime mini games add on, great audio and art, but I hated the fact the UI words don't appear properly on my screen. It's like looking at a vector image with outline but no fill colour and the outline is too thick to read. They don't have the same problem in the screenshots, so I would assume it's just me. Either way, I kind of guessed whatever was on screen. The story dialogue came out just fine so I'm alright.Anyway there's enough variety of stuff to do in each level so it's gonna keep you on your toes and eyes wide open. Not a gripping story, but strong enough to keep you intrigued, playing, and wanting to know the ending too. Just buy it, you review creeping-toms.P.S. I still miss Joe."

Between work and real life commitments I haven't had time to really dig into some of the bigger games I've wanted to play lately, but I still wanted a distraction and something I could play without really having to invest a ton of time and/or a learning curve. Heart's Medicine - Time to Heal filled that niche perfectly.The gameplay interface is nice and uncluttered, and the graphics suit the theme/mood of the game well. I really enjoyed the story too, even if it's more than a little soap opera-y at times. Ok, most of the time, but still.It's not all that challenging but there were more than a handful of levels that I had to attempt a few times to get everything done, just challenging enough for me - not enough to make me rage!quit or break my keyboard. The deeds/trophies really got me hooked, because I'm a completist at heart, I suppose.An apt comparison would be comparing this to a well designed Facebook game that doesn't actually require you to either wait for an energy meter of some sort to refresh, to bug your friends for more energy, or to buy energy etc. in order to keep playing.I really dug it and am looking forward to what comes next in this series, or any other games from the developer for that matter. While I'm sure it won't appeal to everyone, if you're looking for a nice distraction in the form of a time management game then this comes highly recommended."

Personally I found it a little easier than both those games, especially Diner Dash, but it's the same general idea.Additionally there is a story involved in this game which gives it a little something extra.  This might annoy some people who don't want to click through dialogue, but it breaks up the motony of just plowing through timed challenge levels in my opinion.Overall the game succeeds for me because it changes things up by offering different activities, settings, and challenges for each chapter of the game.  There are also challenge levels and a bonus goal per level that gives you something to strive for.  Another thing I appreciate is that you earn money that you can use to upgrade the items in the level to give you advantages when playing.If you crave another Diner Dash, I highly recommend this game."

It reminded me of the Diner Dash games (and the likes) I enjoyed as a teenager in middle/high school.  Intrigued, I saw that the first game was on sale as part of the Summer Sale.  It was a quick buy and what a great buy it was!The story is great and despite the dark turn some aspects take, there's a pleasant light-hearted feel you take away throughout.  Some might find it overly positive despite some subject matter, but to me personally, it never felt cheesy or over the top.  The characters are great, the dialogue is great and it gives the game a great flow.  The gameplay is great; addictive, fun and there's a decent amount of replayability, especially with regard to getting all those achievements.My qualms with the game are small, but they involve control on the mac.  Since I wasn't using a controller, the mousepad had some buggy moments.  I am resigned to the fact I'll never get some achievements because pulling out glass shards with a mac mousepad doesn't work.Verdict:  A game I wholeheartedly recommend and have no shame admitting to playing over 30 hours on :)"

Sometimes it's a real tear-jerker.Gameplay: +The mini-games mixed into the time management style gives a nice break from the normal ""Chain events and do everything as fast as possible"". I found it a little more difficult to chain events in Heart's than other similar titles. There are still a few click-and-drag actions that I haven't been able to get the gold hearts on, and not for lack of trying! The Gold Hearts are a nice new feature, giving a little help with bonus ratings. There are the usual challenges and bonus stages, similar to other Delicious titles.I'm about half way through at this point (don't let my play time fool you - had to leave game idling on menu for a while), and have nothing negative to say."

You follow the tale of a young intern, Allison Heart and it plays in a way that feels like the unfolding of a medical drama as if you're playing through a season of Grey's Anatomy - although a little more light hearted! The gameplay is very simple, time management with a few mini games thrown in. The whole story finishes in about 10 hours including all the extra little challenges so it's a very light game. However I found it fun and a relaxing play through and the story really is quite excellent. Recommend for casual gamers or people that enjoy a good yarn."

The game play is fast pace and the challenge ramps up pretty quickly within the first five or six stages.  The sound track compliments both game play and story moments perfectly.  Definitely worth the price!

I was intrigued with what would I find and at first I thought it was some silly and easy game... how wrong I was...It's a hearthbreaking game... It made me want to cry in every single chapter. They all have their problems.I find their expressions pretty funny, how they are designed, how they blush, how they worry. I really like this game, I can say that it's a pretty easy game to play but really funny too. The story... god, what a story, I didn't think the story would be this good.Now I know that I didn't waste my money, this is a game that is worth its price.10/10 Would buy again.//cries//"

,Not Recommended,494230,33398419,Posted: 9 July,all,Xander77,"I liked Delicious Emily: Message in a Bottle well enough to buy the gamehouse bundle. I was looking forward to more of the DE addictive gameplay and ludicrous storylines. This game disappointed me.Instead of the insane sitcom plot of Delicious Emily, we get a semi-sane hospital-drama plot. A plus or a minus depending on how much you like helping your boyfriend / hospital director ditch his opioid habit via cutesy casual gameplay. Find all the pill bottles in time for a bonus!More importantly - the gameplay is heavily loaded with minigames. Run the patient through the x-ray machine in under 5 seconds for a minor bonus! Set all the dislocated bones in 3 seconds, or the patient starts losing hearts!So, if the Delicious Emily gameplay had a minor emphasis on reflexes, and a heavy emphasis on planning things out so that you take the optimal route and serve as many customers at once before they start losing patience, Heart's Medicine is the opposite of that. Most of the time, the optimal strategy is to serve each patient as quickly as possible when they come in, and pray you don't mess up the minigames. Do that, and the ""serve several patients in a row"" bonuses are mostly irrelevant (except for checkouts).Since my reflexes aren't exactly great, I found the gameplay to be pure torture.(Edit - you can pass each level and go on with the plot regardless of how well or poorly you've done. Getting three stars + bonus challenge + captured guinea pig [yes, really] per level is just a matter of earning trophies, which I usually don't care about. But... there's really no point in making any sort of effort to play the game if you're not going to ace every level, since that's the only challenge you'll find)"

I thought this game was going to be way more narrative and involved than it was. Most of what I've played is a Simon-says type game. I was hoping for some sort of explor-y hospital adventure, which is what I thought the game was advertising, and it seemed a bit different as an idea. Guess that's one me for not investigating the media release materials further."

76561198329593074,Recommended,494230,32032692,Posted: 28 May,all,Weird A,"Time challenging games has always been a favourite of mine - Diner Dash being the first of many (so if anyone knows of any other game similar, hit me up!) - and this was just amazing.It was a quick game - took me two days to finish, but could have taken me just a day - because it was soooo addicting. The story was amazing and I even cried once, maybe three times. And I really didn't expect the story to be that great, but it really was. I am so glad I gave this game a try and I do not regret buying it - it was worth every penny.The controls are easy - it's a simple point and click system. Faster you are at tasks the better, and I managed to complete the game, buy the upgrades, and even complete the challenges.It you are a bit iffy with sound effects as I am on the matter of bone breakage and/or cracking, then when you get to a certain level you may want to turn the sound off, down, or listen to music while you play the stage.But as squeamish as I am I found this easy to play.And if anyone is wondering; I totally ship Allison and Daniel..."

76561197970887820,Recommended,494230,35142342,Posted: 22 September,all,Mandrake42,"Quite a fun little casual time management game.You play a nurse at hospital who is going to work through her training by spending a bit of time in each of the hosptal departments. There are 10 levels per department and each level adds new twists and new things to manage. Gameplay is typical time mangement stuff:  Patients will enter the department and be seated in the waiting area and a little icon will appear above their head showing what sort of treatment they need. A little timer will begin to count down and if it runs out they will lose a heart, lose all their hearts and they will leave in a huff. Basically the quicker you get each person to where they want to go the better and you will need to pay attention to whose timer is the lowest so that you treat them first so as not to lose any hearts. Complete all of a patient's treatments and they will go to the counter and you will score points for every remaining heart.Each level has a certain amount of points you have to score to earn the level bonus of one to three stars. Each star you get also earns you a little bit of money which you can use to upgrade things in the department you are working, for example more comforatable chairs in the waiting room so that patients lose hearts slower. Each level also has a special bonus challenge that requires you to meat some special requirement, such as never running out of medication or getting so many patients to the counter with full hearts.The game also has a story that links things together with tragic patient stories, inter hospital romances and other drama. It's can be a bit melodramatic but it's still kind of fun and engaging and helps give you an extra incentive to push on through the levels.The graphics area about what you would expect from this kind of title and if you have ever played a Gamehouse game before, you will instantly recognise their style. It's all pretty good and helps bring the aformentioned story to life as each character is distinct and emots well. The music is also quite catchy and the main theme is very hummable and it also has some more tense pieces to match the more dramatic beats of the story.All in all if you like casual time management style games, this is one of the better ones out there. Gamehouse tend to produce good quality stuff in this genre so if you have played other titles from them, this is more of the same. Emily from the Delicious series even makes a cameo in some of the levels.A solid well rounded time casual time management game with a likeable story and cast.7.5 out of 10"
