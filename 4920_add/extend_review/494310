Plus, if you`re looking for a game that brings up some serious workout and you have enough room to play, then get this! It might even be faster than Holoball, be prepared!"

So you never now what comes next.- After some games you learn how the different objects behave and know how to move to avoid them. It makes the  game feel like a dance (pro and con)Cons-Edit: Performance is fine now!- You should better have 2m x 2,5m space (i don´t know how it could work well with 2mx1,5m)- After some games you learn how the different objects behave and know how to move to avoid them (pro and con)"

I wasn't sure what to expect seeing as how the only vr runners that I have played were very very bad about making me motion sick.The only thing in this game that made me motion sick at all was one of the pill effects that twists and destorts everything. But that's what you get for taking those drugs!!!!Other then that absolutely incredible. Probably one of my favorite games out at the moment. There are a lot of good games coming out this month but I bet this will make it to my top five list of games released this month.This game will make you move, duck, dodge, reach, grab, fall, laugh, sweat.This game could very well give holopoint a run for it's money on how much this game makes me work and sweat.Hands down if you like games that will make you test your endurance while playing and double as a workout then this game is worth every bit of the asking price.The premise is simple, you dodge the obstacles and grab the coins, but it's so uppaced and addicting that I don't want to put it down!(Below is a video of the gameplay in this game, it is not a review but merely here as an example to show you the gameplay full with webcam recording.)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=717672319"

Very challenging. Scenes change everytime you start again ( which is often ). There is now a practice mode before you start normal mode if you want to use it. Dev is very active and a great price too IMO.
,Recommended,494310,29402309,Posted: 21 January,all,Joshyy,"Bought this game during the Steam Winter sale and have played it many times since. It's turned into a family favourite amongst our household. It's mechanism is simple, you are on a treadmill esque path and you have to duck and dive out of the way of all manner of weird and wondeful contraptions as you slowly(or quickly if you choose a difficult difficulty) move towards it. It gets the sweat flowing on higher difficulties and the halloween version of a nice change of pace and is apparently very scary to the younger sisters and grandparents..My only major criticism will be the solid wall obstacle, which requires a use of a shield in the game. However two can and often do appear one after another. Resulting in an unavoidable death, this should be removed or adjusted.Good game and a must buy on the vive."

It reminds me of the Japanese game show Hole in the Wall!  Make sure you back off the lenses from your face to keep any sweat/salt off of them.  Other than that, my only complaint is (and maybe I missed it) is a little more explanation on how to get past some of the obstacles.  What's with the giant brick wall?  Am I just supposed to eat up a shield plowing through it?"
76561198020445786,Recommended,494310,32374732,Posted: 12 June,all,M1ng0J1ng0,"9 out of 10I bought this game as soon as it came out. Loved the idea but felt the game was trying to kill me. Haven't really played it too many times since. Thought I give it another shot this very day and the improvements are measurable. New levels and refined gameplay, I was actually able to run for a few minutes without fear of planting my face in the wall (which I had done previously). Props to the developer you've done a great job man.Admittedly I'd still consider this game a little dangerous, you're constantly moving in different directions at a fair pace while blindfolded in reallife. The comfort box does a good job to help you know your location in the real world, plus the warning message when you stray too far off centre. I've also placed a mat in the middle of my VR space so it's easy to feel my position.Fun combined with light exercise, a great combination to get warm, get the heart rate up but not overexerted. Do I recommend Unbreakable VR Runner, yes , yes, yes! Do make sure you have the required play area it's rendered unplayable otherwise."

If you're looking for a game that keeps you active, it's this; Holopoint has nothing on this.  It's also more of a full-body exercise, whereas Holopoint can get tiring in just your arms quite quickly."

Put weights in a backpack and wear it while playing this and watch the pounds melt away from your body, lol.  Without weights my quads start to burn , I can only imagine what my legs would feel like if I added weight.  Maybe someday. :DBe very careful of your surroundings and the in-game warning system, as I have walked into my wall a couple of times , fell over a couple of times from slipping on floor ,and  knocked over cups on my desk by bumping into it .9/10 Best exercise game for the Vive. The only thing that could be improved is more level variety :)"
76561197966636457,Recommended,494310,33867776,Posted: 28 July,all,Viking_Quest,This company needs to stop doing the main game and move on to this youtube based one they have. The main game is super fun but man bumping to your own music while getting a work out in is amazing. It needs more work on it to make it more fresh but it is a treat for the cost. I can barely make it through two songs without dying. This game actually makes you do squats and move around unlike a lot of other games you just hit things in. It is really amazing!

76561198099824170,Recommended,494310,24229383,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,clawholm,"Great game - exhausting and challenging in a pleasurable way. It's a very physical game that most people wont be able to have long sessions with, but don't let that scare you! You have to avoid obstacles that comes towards you and try to collect coins with your controllers. The controllers goes dead for a few seconds if they hit any obstacles, making you unable to collect coins/shields, if your headset hits anything it's game over.I like the hard mode the most, but there is also easy (somewhat slower) and practice were you can set your own speed.The order of the traps/obstacles are randomized which makes it highly replayable, and you keep trying again, hoping for better luck (coinbanks.. double coinbanks!) in the next round, even when you're sweating like a pig and the vive-facefoam-thingy is like a salty wet sponge. And that will happen after only a handful of minutes.Soundtrack is great and always have me do a little dance in the beginning of the level.I feel it's worth the money (compared to a lot of the other vr-stuff), and it's probably a good party-game, if you don't mind sharing sweat with your friends.This talanted young dev has my support and I look forward to future updates. Thanks."
