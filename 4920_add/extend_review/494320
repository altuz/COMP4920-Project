76561198002124849,Recommended,494320,30155242,Posted: 24 February,all,Fou-Lu,"=What is it?=Firstly, this is not a Wizardry game of old, or even similar to one of the new installments. This is a *mobage*, a Japanese-style mobile game that has been ported to Steam without the microtransaction nonsense. As long as you know what you should expect, you will enjoy yourself.Wizrogue is in a subgenre of mobile games which I like to call a 'monster battler', a game that derives its mechanics from similar games like Puzzle and Dragons, DBZ Dokkan Battle, Summoner's War, or even Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Note that this game *does* require an online connection to play at time of writing this review.=How do I play?=The way it works is thus: You're given a starter party of some low-ranking  (read: low max-level) heroes, you select a dungeon from a list, and you progress in rogue-lite fashion towards the exit, stabbing monsties and collecting treasure along the way. You will often find coffins which contain other heroes, or are rewarded on a per-dungeon basis with Adventurer Tickets which allow you to roll for new heroes. All heroes have a ranking associated with them, and naturally uncommon or rare have higher stats, higher max levels, and better beginning equipment than common ones.Your characters will level up based on enemies defeated after completing dungeons, which consist of a randomization of 3-6 floors of half a dozen rooms per floor, maybe, which include treasure and traps and the like, and whose objective is usually either get to the bottom or kill the boss on the last floor. You'll notice that you'll accrue a small army, however, with a large batch of useless characters. These characters are 'fed' to other characters (through training) which will give them experience and help them level up faster.The core gameplay is essentially similar to the Japanese console-style roguelikes like the Fushigi Dungeon series. You'll recognize many similar mechanics, like attacking mid-air in order to reveal a trap tile on the space in front of you, or zooming through hallways to get to the next room. There is one caveat: your party has a collective HW (Holy Water) guage which depletes with every action you take. Luckily, HW recovery items are plentiful, and while it does act as a time limit, it doesn't necessarily force you to find the exit before clearing a room of monsters or search the floor for treasure.Despite this, the gameplay has a distinctive Wizardry flavor. The base classes and races are all there, the class change system is present, as is the trapped treasure chest mechanic and the massive amount of pain dished out by certain enemies. The first few dungeons will leave you wishing it was more difficult, but the challenge ramps up fairly quickly. You'll find yourself digging around in the town screen for quite a while in between dungeons training your team, reorganizing, and micro-managing equipment, trying to find the right balance.=Should I bother?=Depends. Do you want a wholly immersive, first-person RPG with obtuse puzzles and a high challenge factor where you custom-make a party of six? In this case, no. In contrast, do you want a somewhat casual social dungeon crawler that rewards you for coming back day by day with a distinct Wizardry vibe? Or maybe you just want a Puzzle & Dragons-like game without the freemium nonsense and a bit more depth to the gameplay? In these cases, yes.Pros:+Solid mechanics+Fast-paced, turn-based gameplay remniscent (but not identical to) the old Wizardries+Board game graphical style+Fun, easy to pick up and put down for quick play sessions+Sweet title theme musicCons:-Obvious mobile port-Getting used to this alternative model of gameplay may cause old-school Wizardry fans discomfort-No overarching plot to speak of (though one faintly exists)I give it a hard Yes to recommend, but be sure you know what you're buying first!(Thanks for reading this lengthy review!

Microtransactions have been removed but from what i was able to see in 2h you have to excessivly grind for WJ (the premium currency in this one) instead. You are also being punished heavily for failing so you end up grinding low level dungeons over and over without a challenge to levelup your extremely generic roster of heroes. To top it off the UI is typical mobile and in ""town"" you play menu manager sim while also fighting the fremium model type limitations on bag size, roster size etc.Not recommended unless 90% discounted. (and even then very questionable)P.S: This has nothing to do with classic Wizardry titles like 6-8 which i have played for hundreds of hours."
76561197986121725,Not Recommended,494320,30198077,Posted: 26 February,all,Braux,"I have played this game on the PC for about 5 hours now, and I really want to like this game. I like Rogue style games and was addicted to Wizardry in the day. It is a compelling premise to combine these worlds.Likes: I like th character development, and the ability to spec out your characters with different gear and classes. I do not even mind that you have to ""eat"" lower level characters to level up your more powerful ones. The use of animated miniatures is pretty cool as well.Dislikes: I am always WJ currency poor in the game, and the ability to unluck the most powerful characters is highly dependent upon the WJ currency. It feels like they ported the game from an in-game purchase model where the intentional shortage is intended to motivate players to purchase more currency with real money, except there are no in-game purchases anymore (which I love) and they did not change the trickle with which you make more WJ.The game is buggy as hell. Somewhat randomly certain characters when you Fortify them (level them up) or change their class get stuck on the animation screeen in which the game either gives you no way off the screen or the botton you are intended to push does nothing. I have had to CTRL-ALT-DEL many, many times to get out of the screeen and thus, had to restart the game each time. Interestingly, the game itself is apparently still running fine, you just cannot get out of that screen.Finally, I do not like that the backrow characters seemingly do nothing unless you specifically get one of them to use a particular ability (like case a spell or shoot a bow). They do not seem to involve themselves in any obvious way in the head-to-head encoutners. The front rowers all swing, do apparent damage and take damage, the backrowers do nothing even when you have ranged or far-reaching weapons equiped. Additionally, you cannot intentionally target particular characters in the opponent party, particularly the characters int he backrow. Thus, you regularly clean out the front row, only to have their backrow get an automatic attack on you every time. Why can't my archers or mages attack their backrow characters while my fighters attack their front?Thus, as much as like the compelling idea, the execution of the game seems like they missed some really obvious features that would seem to be obvious in a party-based game of this nature. Perhaps with a patch they can fix these things, but at the moment the game quickly becomes so frustrating it makes me want to stop even though it is a game I would easily play a lot with these minor fixes."
76561198281568815,Not Recommended,494320,31604577,Posted: 7 May,all,Lonewolf Enoch,"*2017-07-10*It's been 2 months and the bugs still persists.When they fix something, something else goes wrong.Seems to me that the original programmer(s) is not doing the fixes.My hope for this game is gone.Good luck on your choice.*2017-05-07*I really like this game. But I cannot recommend it to you as of the above date. A little ironic?Long story short, it is because of the bugs.Short story long...Bug 1. After 100+ hours of game play. I have yet to find ONE single piece of equipment from monster/chest drops. Yup, you heard me right, absolutely no drops at all from all the dungeon crawling I've done so far (including dungeons with ""possible boss drop of equipment"" explanation on them). So I am still stuck with the equipment that the shop sells (and some equipment that the Rare and Super Rare adventurers start with).Bug 2. After you class change, you will lose your already learned spells of the previous class. The best thing about the classic Wizardry was that you keep your old spells, so you can make a magic-using-fighter, a healer-thief, etc. But not until this is fixed.Bug 3. All other class seems to be leveling up fine, but the Ninja class is gaining 1 HP (Hit Points) per level! My Mage could take more damage than my Ninja... not good.The above bugs are my main concerns for those who want to play this game.As mentioned, if the bugs were fixed, I would highly recommend this game to people who enjoy dungeon crawling RPGs.=== Personal likes/dislikes ===I recently bought this game WITH the above bugs and played it thus far. This is how enjoyable it is.The below is a personal preference!Likes1. Very simple input. No difficult key memorization. Mouse only command.2. The old Wizardry classesFighter, Lord, Samurai, Mage, Priest, Bishop, Thief, Ninja3. Beautiful icon/figurine gives you the pen and paper, table top RPG, name it what you want, old school feeling.Each class has 4 tier upgrade system and each tier has a better looking figurineTier 1: max level ~15 (common)Tier 2: max level ~30 (uncommon)Tier 3: max level ~45 (rare)Tier 4: max level ~99 (super rare)Dislikes1. Too simple input. Mouse only command. Doing absolutely everything with a single mouse click will strain your finger.2. Only weapon equipment slot. Armor is pre-determined and upgrades when you 'tier up'. No trinket, rings, helmets, gloves, boots, pants, etc.3. You cannot create your own adventurers. They are random, although you may change the name, the race/class/alignment/portrait are all fixed. So if you want a certain race, a certain class, a certain alignment, with a certain protrait.... get ready to farm A LOT like I have. I still have yet the exact combination of party members I would like to have. ;)4. No C (common), UC (uncommon) female adventurers.From my experience so far, only Rare and Super Rare female adventurers are available.And they are very rarely available through Elite Currency (the very slow but farmable WizJewels) and further on in the scenario. And still there seems to be only a few, and all seems to have a fixed class at the time of this writing.5. The portrayal of some racesHuman, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, PorkluThe three races I play are Human, Dwarves, and some Elves. I sell the Gnomes and Porklu Adventurers on sight. More explanation later.6. The back-row of 3 adventurers have very limited actions.You take a turn, enemy takes a turn, etc.On your turn, you can chose to attack with the 3 front row adventurers (if in melee range) or use a single spell or let loose an arrow (melee or ranged). Almost all the time, it is difficult to over-damage your front row with a single spell.7. A lot of the spell names and description does not match each other. For example, in the classic Wizardry, a locate person spell would be useful to find your lost adventurers because if your party wiped out, you would need another party to look for them!, but Wizrogue is much more forgiving and don't need such a spell, but it exists and what it does is even more intriguing.... it 'Reveals enemies, chests, items, and stairs on the current floor.'. Some spell names need fixing.Again, these are my personal thought...A picture is worth a thousand words.Now go and look at the screen shot #7 on this page.It should be the last screenshot with the 10 adventurers on it.1st adventurer named Lythgoe. He is a Porklu male.4th adventurer named Lucraft is an Elven male.6th adventurer named Dunbar is an Elven male.10th adventurer named Condren is Lucrafts twin brother.The 5th adventurer named Sandy is a Dwarven male.I had a Viviane(?), an Elf, who I used for quite some time until I realized it was a He.So, if you like this kind of adventurers in your party, that's fine. But this is definetly not for me.=== conclusion ===Although there are more dislikes than likes, I really like this game.This is just to show you what kind of game to expect as I didn't know most of the things I wrote here until I actually bought and played a few hours. You will know what to expect. =)If the bugs are fixed, I highly recommend this game for the dungeon crawlers like me, who likes farming and grinding, building their adventurers, class changing to increase their HP, then again for Priest spells, perhaps again for Mage spells, then finally changing to their desired final class."
76561198070925419,Recommended,494320,30213066,Posted: 26 February,all,Corpselocker,"***Final Update 5/22/2017***The issues with the update were resolved.  I still plink around, but have not yet finished.  I do suspect I will make it through eventually.***Update 4/24/2017***I still visit the game for a few rounds daily.  This new patch, though, has somehow messed up my ability to sell adventurer items.  I do hope they fix it; it would be horrific if after all this time it ruined my ability to play.***Update 3/6/2017***Once I leveled up enough to get into the master dungeons, there was more variation to the basic formula of the game.  It is now more exciting because some of these are cripplingly tough, but give you something outside of the tiered dungeons to do.  While it may not be for everyone, I think this is likely a title I will continue to come back to.**************************This is a tough one for me to rate.  How many times have you asked yourself:  This game would be great if they made it one-time pay versus pay to play.  This is obviously a p2p game, but it has been converted to a single pay game.  The problem, though, lies in that if you random roll junk characters for awhile, you are left to regrinding a single dungeon over and over without progress (not to mention if your toons get killed).  It is a slot machine, but it doesn't have a reason to be.  Your time versus payout efforts are similar to playing a p2p game with harsh f2p mechanisms.Now, I am a Wizardry fan through and through.  It was my first game I owned on an Apple IIe almost fourty years ago.  I've replayed all of the Wizardy titles over and over (this type of gameplay is often referred to as a 'blobber') because it has such a challenging curve.  Does this game provide the same curve?  Maybe, but I am not deep enough yet.  I still want to love and buy all things Wizardy; this may be a turning point.This Wizardy does have all of the elements that the Japanese have expanded upon.  It does have the odd Porkul race.  It appears to have some of the same NPC story tellers as other games.  The same store/city dynamic outside of the dungeon.The dungeons, which usually consist of three levels, are put on a counter called wizardy points so you must not daudle towards your advance.  Each move burns some of these points.  There seems to be enough potions to replenish this in the early game, but I started saving these potions in my limited inventory space.  So, you really only need to hit a three ladder spaces to escape.  But it is always, so far, the same ""possible"" nine by nine grid of rooms.  Early on, you might have a floor of 3-4 rooms used on this nine by nine room grid.  But even getting to the second real dungeon past the newb dungeon, it feels repeatative.While the tutorial is semi-sufficent enough, it doesn't go into how all of the higher leveling and evolving works efficently.  I've played enough f2p/p2w games that I know what to do, but I was still kinda fuzzy.  As a grasped a new UC (no rares), I jammed them into my common slots regardless.  Leveling commons is a waste.I will try again one more time.  A good, long burst.  Until then, I struggle to show the worth of $10 except that it might show that the Wizardry franchise is a worthwhile investment in english speaking countries (The Japanese have loads of non-ported expansions)."
,Recommended,494320,30177659,Posted: 25 February,all,Edrondol,"Do not be fooled into thinking this is a Wizardry game in any sense of the word. It is only tangentially related to the classic game, with only the spell names and classes being the same. Everything else is different.This is not to say that it's a BAD game, just that it's not a WIZARDRY game. This has almost 0 RPG to it other than your characters get HP & stats as they level. It's more like a very light strategy game than anything.If you are looking for an old-style RPG, keep looking. If you are looking for a cheap and interesting little game to help pass some time, then by all means give it a shot. Again, it's not a bad game, but I think it is falsly advertised."
,Recommended,494320,30150504,Posted: 24 February,all,johndraugr,"Ok.... so I just played the tutorial and I gotta say... ""I LOVE it so far!"" What makes me like it is two-fold...1. The game mimics table top pen and paper gaming in that your heroes and the monsters are like typical fantasy miniatures square based and all. The dungeons resemble those expensive dungeon tiles like those from Dwarvenforge, etc... You really feel like your playing on your kitchen table with excellently painted miniatures and awesome dungeon/labyritnhian tiles. I also love the way the gameplay operates and so far, it’s very easy to grasp.Now on to #2 and this is a BIG one for me....2. I have been a fan of Wizardry since the early days of home computing when I first laid eyes on ""Wizardry I - Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord"" on my uncle's Apple III computer. The graphics in all its magnificent monochrome (single color green for you younger gamers who may have never experienced monochrome green, amber, and sometimes even red, it depended on the actual monitor you had. Back then color monitors were very expensive.) Anyhow, I've played the original games many times over the last 30+ years and I was happy to see familiar names and spells in Wizrogue. Halito = Little Fire, Dios heals wounds. I remember these from way back when I first braved the realms of Wizardry and yet they are here in Wizrogue and have the same effects. Also, Gilgamesh's Tavern seems to still be around! I wonder if an older Gilgamesh still runs the establishment? ;)In short there appears to be a lot of nostalgia from the original series, just how much I don't know yet, but just the idea of familiar spells, locales, and maybe even monsters have me anxious to get back to the game. Saying that... that is what I'm going to do. I will definitely update this review once I have a few hours under my belt. I hope the experience continues to be great."

My only gripe, however, is that this game's mobile free to play origins do shine through (lots of options to pay to revive, get elite new party members, etc.) and the UI's streamlined nature makes it clear it was originally played on a much smaller screen)."
76561198025051194,Recommended,494320,30234265,Posted: 27 February,all,emirfassad,"This game is sort of, kind of okayl  It does pay a bit of homage to Wizardry, at least the spells have similar names.Besides the obvious, what most differentiats this from Wizardry is the lack individualization of the charcters within a  party.  In combat the entire party has a single action.  There is no interaction within the party.  If, for instance,  the priest must heal a wounded fighter then healing is  the only action the group performs.  The player cannot choose to attack melee with the front line, aid with healers and launch ranged attacks with mages and archers.  This lack of individual identies for the characters  dulls the role-playing experience.Likewise, the fixed point of view, no zoom, no pan,  inhibits player involvement with the game.  Why would the create such clever replications of miniatures and not allow us to look at them.  On that same line, there is no way to identify an opponent until it attacks.These are core issues with the game's design that I doubt that the Devs will, or can,  address.Nonetheless,  the game is worth a couple hours playtime at a price comparable to watching a movie in a theater.Steam really needs a _Meh_ rating."
76561198006312014,Recommended,494320,30228080,Posted: 27 February,all,Sertis,"A great clicker for Wizardry fans.  First up, this is not like classic wizardry, but it keeps some of the best aspects of it such as the character system with the traditional classes (from 1-3) including class hopping.  Strategy is a bit different this time since you can only cast or melee once a round so those front line casters now have a lot more use than camp healers and can be used repeatedly at standoff ranges.  It's also easier than either a roguelike or classic wizardry since there's no permadeath, and no need for secondary parties for corpse retrieval, you simply pop back in town dead minus any unequipped loot.  You can also pay for youth so it's like the temple of cant got a major upgrade.  Have fun!"
76561198009088508,Recommended,494320,31508750,Posted: 2 May,all,Micothecat,"So far a really fun little dungeon crawler with a nice D&D tabletop feel.  Your party and monsters ""hop"" around the board as neat little miniatures and attacks are carried out like a familiar rogue like/lite game.  Back row members can cast spells or shoot missile weapons.  The dungeons are procedural and vary in difficulty.  Your party has a limited time to spend in each dungeon as each turn the protection granted from holy water deteriorates due to the dungeon ""miasma"".  Monsters also start to respawn when your party leaves a room, so backtracking can be risky.As others have mentioned this was a Free to Play game with all the crappy FTP mechanics (I freaking despise free to play).  Many of those mechanics have been adjusted, though, and the premium currency is just gained via completing dungeons and from what I can tell fighting monsters."
,Recommended,494320,30639471,Posted: 20 March,all,FUXOFT,"It's a pity you cannot play this game on your mobile (it was originally mobile ""pay per play"" game). It's a great little RPG with VERY simple rules, almost like a puzzle game. I especially like that there is absolutely no story / cutscenes etc (If I wanted those, I'd watch a movie). You just enter dungeon, kill everyone, loot everything, upgrade equipment, train heroes, rinse, repeat (the dungeons are randomly generated). It's simple but it's very polished (sound is very satisfying). I'd really like to have similar professional product on my Android (without the ""pay for play"" crap). P.S: I did NOT play any of the old Wizardry games."
,Recommended,494320,30155485,Posted: 24 February,all,Zyloch,"When I first started, I really thought I bought a F2P mobile game. After reading the forums it seems like it was ported from a mobile version, but they replaced all the premium currency packs with ingame currency. It's good if you don't want Premium Content to ruin the game, but bad, since it means you have to grind for Premium Currency now. So far, I'm not sure what the grind will be like.Another gripe I have with this is, rather then customizing the character you want. You now get random characters with random stats. So you basically have to keep rolling until you get the character you want. However you do have the option the change classes later, if you decide to increase its age. The combat is also simplified because it was previously a mobile, so it's mostly point and click, with an occasional skill or two thrown in. So to summarize.Pros--------------------*The game is an interesting twist on rogue games with a hint of wizardry IP.*No $99 premium currency packs, so no P2W mechanics.*Overall worth it for the price, since I've thrown more money then this on mobile games.*Great achievement system to keep you hooked.Cons--------------------*Characters are randomly generated with preset class/stats. (However class can be changed)*Combat is simplified, eventually makes the game seem monotonous.*Difficulty is nowhere wizardry level to far, for previous wizardry players. Your first R unit you get after tutorial just steamrolls the first couple of dungeons.I'll update more, as soon as I put more time into it. Overall it's still an entertaining game and does scratch a rogue/rpg itch."

If Steam had a middle option, instead of just thumbs up or down, I'd give it that.  I've played it for 9 hours so far, and I'm not ready to quit yet, which is a lot more than I can say for more expensive games I've purchased lately.It definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like gacha type games, pick it up on sale sometime."

Next arrange them in the formation you'd like. 3 in the front and 3 in the back.From there you enter the labyrinth and slay monsters while picking up loot. It's fairly easy and straight forward for a while. As the game progresses there comes a need for better weapons and better tactics. Cool little dungeon crawler and virtually bug free.

I continued to play, even though I prefer something deeper.It does play well, fairly fast gameplay, easy to pick up, and kinda fun. Shows signs of actual party fighting, and not just clicking. random potion and scroll drops aid in the crawl and thoughtfull prestocking before entering dungeon is something you should do.Picking from an available area that has a number of subdungeons with star ratings for difficulty. Your party moves freely in the random made tile dungeons with movement in 8 directions, your entire party occupies one tile and can do one move at a time, such as frontline melee attack or rear line ranged attack, use item, or move, all are moves that take up time from the protection you have initially from the dungeons lethal miasma, your protection can be lengthened with items and drops. You will also find coffins of fallen heros whose souls can be returned upon finishing dungeon, than you can keep them if you like the stats, or feed them to your party members for experience. you can switch in and out all hero's owned into party or make 3 different parties and store 2. You may also switch their job, such as warrior to rogue. You have no choice in stats, they lvl on their own. (dang)Fun so far, so I give it thumbs up.I add that the game to me, is more like a chess party dungeon crawler where your party makeup and its different builds by type and rarity of adventures is what gives your choices of actions, which, when you move into a shocking blitz of monsters and your next choice of action will be left to prethinking of bag stock and adventure type and position."

I can't tell if there is any depth or complexity or just the illusion of it.I want to like it.  But...I dunno....Anyways, for 10$....I dunno...really wish there was a maybe?  I got my money's worth out of it for the 8 hours at least.  I would say that this is worthwhile if you've already scraped the bottom of the barrel of roguelikes."
76561198025542947,Recommended,494320,30169202,Posted: 25 February,all,fumanchi,"Wizrogue is exactly what the title says: Wizardry meets roguelike game. I was impressed how well this blend works. Gameplay is very solid and balanced, underlying mechanics of Wizardry is a good background for roguelike game. As the additional bonus, the game is kept in the convention of the tabletop game, with mini figures representing your party and cards representing spells. The graphics are really good, I think that if that game would be considered as a pure roguelike, I'd say it has the best graphics from all other installments so far. Music and sound effects are also very good.There is only one aspect of the game which can be a bit irritating: the mobile game roots of the game somehow got through to the surface. There are revive options, paid elite members and other reminiscent of In-App-Purchases which shouldn't be in paid version. My guess is that if those elements were fully eradicated, even with the certain death of the characters, the game would only improve."
76561198047888565,Not Recommended,494320,30212962,Posted: 26 February,all,Rifleman762,"I purchased this game on sale for around $9.  The game cetainly feels like a ported mobile game, but fans of Wizardry might enjoy the distinct ""Wizardry feeling"" the game has.  The game itself feels like a board game, with adventures into dungeons being handled with the movement of character pieces or miniatures.  Different caliber of heroes are either rolled up with earned tickets, or found while dungeon crawling.Unfortunately, I didn't get much futher in the game than that.  The game constantly crashes no more than 5 minutes into the game.  My system meets the posted requirments, so I assume this is a bug they will hopefully fix soon.  Until then, I'd stay away from this game."

,Recommended,494320,30169040,Posted: 25 February,all,Tutorials $6,"Preliminary thoughts:Pros:-It's a unique spin on Wizardry. I never would have thought anyone came up with the idea of splicing it with a roguelike, but here we are.-The translation is very well done (at least so far). Games like this typically have lackluster translations, but I haven't seen any of that.-The tutorial clearly explains the mechanics of the game and how they work so there's very little guesswork to be done.Cons:-It's hard to really call this a con for everyone, but this game is a port of a mobile game that's been (I hope!) stripped of its cash shop mechanics (though the things you would typically purchase in such a game are still there) and it shows. The interface is very much what you'd see in a mobile game, and this may understandably turn people away from it.-Following the previous point, some people may not want to pay $12 for something they don't have to pay for on mobile. IMO, it's not a terrible asking price given that there doesn't appear to be any IAP.In all, it's not a terrible game at all, but a rather niche one. I would personally recommend it to anyone who is both a fan of Wiz and a fan of roguelikes, but anyone else should do some research first and see what they're getting into before pulling the trigger."

I would highly recomend if your looking for a rpg that doesn't require three days of reading or a crafting system that requires a college degree. Also a great sound track and I would have never known this was an asian game. Great Job!"

An interested take on an old game, kind of like Ogre Battle meets Wizardry.  The one thing i really dont like is how characters are created.  It is completely random.  You should be able to pick a class.  I still cant complete my team with the classes i want, and have to use a couple of stand ins until i can get a real mage (still using the starter mage) while the rest of the team is rares and 1 uncommon priest.  The game play is streamlined for quick play, which is nice for new playerss getting into this kind of game but advance players will find if rather boring and repetitive.  I still find the game fun though, Dungeons are short (3 level currently) making it easy to do while at work."

76561198038553441,Recommended,494320,35035175,Posted: 17 September,all,YouDaRealMVP,"Alrighty Time to make my review more bulky, because I think this game doesnt deserve to be mixed but rather positive.A lot of the negative reviews are complaining about the genre this game is, and that it is not infact a wizardry game (hence why the title is wizrogue). This is a collectable minature game, with a bunch of customization set in the wizardry universe using there system.I have also seen some complaints of the game being too simple.This game is pretty complex as far as these kinds of games go, more complex than a lot of rogue likes, you are not just mindlessly moving around, you have nicely animated spells to use, equipment with special abillities, attacks per round, damage types, ect ect.The game also has a nice difficulty curve, and because death is punished (but not too harshly)you will find yourself going back to previous laberinth to power up your guys for fear of dying.But to summarise this poorly written mess of a review:Pros-Nice collectable game, where you get new characters at a pretty quick rateLoads of party customizationmany character classes to choose fromnice musicreally high production value for this type of gamevaried enemieschallenging gameplayMixed-Character progression is weighted RNG. What I mean by that is that a character will have a chance of gaining stats based on class and race, this is random and some poeple may find that frustrating while others find it exiting and enjoy the replayability that it brings.Cons-Despite working well on PC, its obvious this game was designed for mobile devices, and you use the mouse for everything. you can hold the mouse to quickly more trough dungeons, but these kind of controls do require geting used to.All in all me and my buddies found this game super enjoyable to watch/ play so pick it up. its only cheap."
