,Not Recommended,494470,30913007,Posted: 2 April,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"The name of this game should be “My Psycho” or “My A-hole”. Because that’s what those guys really are, just maniacs trying to abuse a stupid MC that can’t do anything on her own. The guys are “butlers”, yet they treat the MC like garbage and she’s totally okay with that because that’s “just how they show their love”. The story is boring, the characters are annoying, and the art style is a bit weird, the guys have huge hands that look like bird claws. How sexy.0/10, I only recommend this trash if a) you want to play it to laugh at how horrible this whole VN is or b) you enjoy being treated like crap by mutant bird men. Otherwise, avoid this like the plague. There’s plenty of otome games that are a lot better than this one."

Then this is the game for you!All three dudes are ridiculously possessive to the point that two out of three call you their possession. The third? He wont let you talk to other men without him there to ""translate"" for you. The heroine is meek to the point where she actually tells the dude she likes the borderline abusive behaviour. ""That's just how he shows his love"".If you can deal with that then maybe you'll enjoy the game. But be warned."

,Recommended,494470,24943627,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,Sajiri,"Alright, Im gonna post this with the admittance I'm not really a *fan* of visual novels (though I do play them time to time just to kill a few hours if I dont want to focus on an action game/MMO) and I've so far only been through Kira's routeI picked this up because steam suggested it and it was cheap. At first I found it incredibly forced and cringey. You're a college aged naive and purehearted woman who's been sent to live in your wealthy relative's mansion and be waited on by a bunch of hot young guys. Because this is Japan and of course you do. I found the premise of it, as well as how sudden and over the top the flirting and touching was, pretty over the top, but as I continued to play, things started to tone down a bit and by the end of it, I found it pretty sweet. The art is fantastic, and while I didn't like Kira so much at first (I cant comment on the other guys yet), I was pretty fond of him by the end of his path.Things I was less fond of- the music is incredibly repeatitive, and loops at a rather jarring spot. The character you play as is just a little *too* 'cute' and 'purehearted'. But this is Japan where Im living with an actor, a model, and an idol waiting on me, so what do I know. There's several grammar mistakes, making some lines really hard to understand.For the price though, it was fun and I'll have to get to the other paths soon. The cringeyness of the beginning may just have been specific to Kira."

It seems like the main characters in a lot of this dev's games are all that way too. Kinda submissive and awkward and...well...idk, stereotypical Japanese female? @___@;; Wish there were more guys to choose from and possibly a female maid but then it wouldn't be a butler-centric game, I suppose. Still need moarrr."
,Recommended,494470,29156448,Posted: 9 January,all,Nat,"This game is trash in the same way a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chickflick, bad smutty one shot manga, craptastic soap opera or gratuitous anime is. The main character is barely a character, the men are all dumb pretty jerks and it's pretty misogynistic. That being said, I love this in the same way I love a bad B-movie. It's a beautiful train wreck that makes me giggle and cackle as I play. There are so many forced, stupid, implausible scenes and the characters are unbelievably awful, to the point that I'm sure this game is somewhat self aware. If you are someone like me who likes this sort of trash, get this game on sale like I did. Like, for sure not full price, but this game has its place for people with a bizarre love of terrible things like this."

I constantly found myself thinking I was reading a teenage fanfiction as some of the romantic scenes arose. Not only that but the personalities that were the main focus of this game for the boys are poorly written and cliche however they can be sweet but are horrible possesive if you arent into that sort of thing.Honestly this game is great if you aren't in it for some form of plot/ character development because while the boys supposedly fix themselves they really dont and just keep their originial personality. The whole thing is quite irritating and while I was not originally looking for lewd content the way the game is written makes you think you know sure DO IT JUST GO FOR IT BE LEWD it just never gets there which slightly is irritating considering how much it constantly builds to it.This game by far is not the worst thing in the way of otome games but you can definitely find better if you are looking for story and solid personality characters."

,Not Recommended,494470,33198998,Posted: 3 July,all,~Fujoshi-chan~,"I'm well aware this company doesn't have very in-depth or... well, GOOD games...But as someone who loves maids and butlers, I sorta pick these kinds of things up to try them anyway.It's not very good, unsurprisingly, and once again the CGs are bland and the characters look pretty horrendous.When you have mysogynistic love interests who are sociopathic in some way, with a blatantly stupid and standard MC, I'm not gonna relate to anything the story or characters have to offer, and I'm essentially going to get ticked off. I feel like the men in this barely act like butlers at all, like, don't just slap 'butlers' on there when all you're giving me is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fanservice and no ACTUAL SERVICE. Butlers shouldn't be disgraced like this.Also, if you're actually looking for smut, don't bother here.You're significantly better off going and reading ___ x Reader fanfiction on AO3, to be honest."

76561198131340987,Recommended,494470,25502014,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,Ambnesia,"There are only 3 route options, but quality/fleshed out characters wins out over choosing from a group of clones.  The BGM is a really relaxing bonus; moreover, of all the games I've played from this publisher, the art in My Butler is a cut above the rest.  Waiting until a sale levels your purchase off at 8$, can make it easier to justify.The characters are celebs, you will not receive the true butler experience, this game's clearly designed to play into fantasy.  How the MC even falls into this situation is ""out there"" but who's playing these games for a flawless plot alone?  If you're able to roll with the initial quirks, the rest of their stories have satisfying depth.Though the game's more sultry than average, its content isn't exceptionally graphic - the sensuality is just a more often occurring theme.  Heck, the sado labeled character was really harmless; where as the ""pretty"" boy's boldness surprised me more.  If you're approaching this with the right expectations that comes with casual gaming, such as desiring to be escorted into the fun world of Otome reverie at its strongest, this product delivers."

I found this game annoying 2 chapters into each route, so I had to fastforward everything until the endings to see if anything changed. Nope. What pisses me off is how passive the player character is. The fact that there's next to no reason for the player to show affection to any of these romantic interests is what makes this visual novel bad. There's no character development for any of the characters present. The same annoying cons from other Dogenzaka Lab games are also present (looping music and garbage translations that need to be fixed). Maybe I'm just critical because of my expectations from their other games that I enjoyed."

Honestly this one surprised me with how much I enjoyed Kira's route. He genuinely surprised me in a good way as opposed to Kamizaki, who surprised me by turning out to be way more creepy then I had hoped he'd be. Yonekura was pretty much standard fair.If you've ever read a romance novel from the 70s or early 80s (the ones where the guy's a bit of a sadist or bully, the heroine is meek and there's almost always a teary misunderstanding in the final few pages) then that's pretty much Dogenzaka Lab VN's in a nutshell. There's a certain level of silly disbelief that's needed to enjoy them, but overall they're fine.Playtime inflated by forgetting to turn it off a couple of nights. I'd say running through a happy and normal ending takes roughly two to three hours per guy depending on how fast you read and whether or not you're into their archetype.Forever holding out hope for Kirishima and Kagurazaka routes in the future."

,Not Recommended,494470,28906260,Posted: 1 January,all,Cat Alex,"3/10This game makes me cringe a lot. All of the dateable characters are jerks. One in particular is quite possessive and creepy, which I did not find enjoyable. I ended up wanting to choose the two undateable professional butlers instead and be done with it! There are far better Dogenzaka Lab games out there. I would recommend 'Men of Yoshiwara - Kikuya' instead."
,Recommended,494470,25285059,"Posted: 1 September, 2016",all,Naruchin ☆,"The premise of this game is nuts. Celebrities turned butlers to learn how to treat women right? Yeah. Spoiler alert: they don't treat MC-chan right.While sprites and CGs are gorgeous, the backgrounds are blurry and pixelated (some have been fixed in an update, but many are still pretty wonky lookingg). The music playing in the background is okay, few forgettable tracks that don't get in the way. I like that.Now, about the guys.I brute forced Yonekura's achievements by skipping, since the very first scene of his route made me kinkshame his foot fetish pretty hard and then I couldn't take him seriously anymore. I can't say much about him, despite the fact that I kind of thought he was cool in the other two routes.Kira was a pleasant surprise. I often whine that in these games, the S-type characters throw terms like 'punishment', 'naughty girl' and other 50 Shades-lite stuff. His route was like that, but with the added bonus of him being actually pretty clumsily in love and his conflict being explored quite well. He was surprisingly cute with MC-chan in the second half of the route.Kamisaki... I feel like his description isn't actually telling anythin about his personality. I thought he would be the cute fluffy romance option, but he's a super annoying tsundere going for yandere. I thought his route was actually pretty creepy, given that everybody around MC-chan was warning her that he wasn't behaving in a healthy way, but the choices to reach the happy ending were those in which MC-chan was oblivious and forgiving of his toxicity. Eventually in the end he realizes he crossed the line and apologized, but man...Despite the name 'My Butler', the only real butlers are the two guys in the background (me wants a Kagurazaka route!). Also, the focus is literally on the budding relationship, as MC does nothing for 3 months (which means she has no goals, little motivation, no friends... super generic, overly pure & clumsy & oblivious MC).I did enjoy to a degree the two routes that I read, but I would have preferred getting Kira's route on mobile instead of the bundle. On the positive side, the bundle has all routes, sequels and date scenarios, so if all the guys sound appealing to you, it's a better deal."

It can be a good idea.To resume the story : you are ask by your (very rich) auntto choose a butler for 1 month among some very popular guys that have some problems with girls. It's like some training for them, and you will have the help of 2 seniors butler to teach him some manners... The line is quite common, but it can do the trick... The scene is ready for the game. And that's when I started to be disappointedWhen I buy a game with butlers, I think of smooth talks, impeccable manners, grooming standards, of dignity, grace and discretion... And, in that point, this game just miss the goal...As an example, do you even imagine that one of the senior butlers can dress himself correctly ? He has a skirt opened from the neck to middle chest and untied tie, even at work... Seriously, the day I see such a butler, I'll worry about the rest of his attitude... Is it this guy that have to teach proper manners to others ? Well, let's say that he can go himself to a formation as student... Luckily, the other one is a more classical butler.The story lines isn't bright as well, and with to many sexual content. Smut isn't the thing I like, but I tolerate it in a interesting story. That not quite the case here.I  remove the game of my PC after just one caracter... It's quite sad, because they have a quite intersting idea, good design, and the music isn't bad... To bad the sex take such a place, removing all the potential of this game and any interesting story line (yeah, you you're busy writing thoses things, you're not writing more interesting events...)."

Both Kira and Yonekura's routes started off with them physically harassing the MC and forcing her to undress in their first encounter and I was unable to play passed the first chapter of both their routes. Makoto's route was the lesser evil and I was able to play it but I found him too clingy and childish. He was forceful at times but not as much as the other two. I was expecting more but I must say that I was disappointed.
