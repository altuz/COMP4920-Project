What you see in the trailer is what you get.To fully beat the game, you need to clear every level in two ways (separately or at the same time if you're a speed god): by collecting all gems and by going faster than a set time, which is usually very tight.There's several semi-hidden mechanics that will help you go faster, but also make the levels more tricky to clear due to fast speeds.Overall a much more solid game from the dev of Barrier X, I got what I expected and it was a very sweet experience :^)"
76561198044487151,Recommended,494580,29094181,Posted: 7 January,all,Ryuze,"Standby is a tough-as-nails platformer made for speedrunners and platforming masochists. The game centers around speed, timing, and precision, with minimalist visuals, and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. I got through all 54 levels in roughly 3 hours, but this game is meant to be played to perfection, with leaderboards and collectibles for completionists.TLDR: I recommend this for speedrunners and platformer enthusiats looking for a fast-paced challenge.my playthrough:https://www.twitch.tv/ryuze/v/112716606"

And when after endless attempts you'll finally beat the level, you would like to do it again - faster, better, stronger, with collecting all these rombs in your way! Speedrun mode increasy challenge mood. There are no something incredible or special features in this game, no metagame or customisation, but platforming part is very good. SO, if you like such platformers - you should like this thing, it really gives you strong emotions!P.S. Electronic soundtrack is really charming!"

I loved Dustforce, but it was a little bit too difficult for me, and I couldn't finish some of the levels and wasn't able to beat the game. STANDBY is a perfect stand-in since I don't have much time for gaming, and always wanted a bite-sized game to master and get good at speed running."

,Not Recommended,494580,30404071,Posted: 8 March,all,flutterravie,"Tried my best to enjoy the game, but its controls are not responsive enough. I've got that frustrating feeling of ""I'm sure I hit that jump button!"" when my character doesn't actually jump - which is not present in the likes of Super Meat Boy. It's just annoying."

,Recommended,494580,29141116,Posted: 9 January,all,noxtherox,"Great game, really fast paced and fun overall.It's a bit hard to coordinate all your mechanics at start but you will improve. Seems like an ideal game for speedrunning.I liked I wanna be the boshy, Super Meat Boy, etc, where you need to memorize stuff and be very coordinated, and this ticks the same boxes in this regard"

,Recommended,494580,29445069,Posted: 23 January,all,ToweringManiac,Stanby is a very fast-paced and stylish precision platformer. If you like a challenge then this game will satisfy your itch for hard as nails platforming. You will die many times trying to beat a level but will be filled with satisfation when you fianlly pull off the right combination of moves to finally put that level away.Check out my video for more in depth thoughts.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVrKf8dUaj4

,Not Recommended,494580,29106805,Posted: 7 January,all,Mekkx,"When I bought this, I thought it would be similar to other platforming games. While that is true to some extent, this is a much worse version of your stereotypical platformer. You have to be very precise, like in most platformers, but most of the game mechanics make this very frustrating. One of my main issues with this game is jumping. While jumping, you have no control of the character other than making him dash to the ground. In addition, there are only 3 directions of jumping: straight up, diagonal left, and diagonal right. This means that if you jump right, and see you are jumping too far, there is nothing you can do about it. Another one of my compaints is how the dash mechanic works. If you are running, you can hit a button to dash. The problem is, if you hit a direction at the same time as the dash button, sometimes you will not dash, because it does not register you as running. lost of times I am on a small platform, and without thinking, I hit run and dash at the same time, but dash does not work, so I die. In addition, there is no way to buffer a dash in the air, so you have to time it perfectly when you land. The final thing I am going to say is the lasers. After a few levels, lasers start showing up that blink on and off. This is a problem because it takes away from the speedrunning aspect of the game. When I am trying to finish a level with record time, the lazers seem very random, and I am doing the same thing over and over hoping the lazer with be off when I am there, because that is how to get the fastest time. Other than these things, It is a great game, but these issues make it very frustrating, and in my oppinion, not worth playing."
,Recommended,494580,31143778,Posted: 14 April,all,Synchro,"Not sure if I can recommend this game if you plan on playing with a controller. Yes it's fast paced, yes I think it's more tatgeted to speedrunners/ completionists, but I cannot for the life of me, fathom the controls. Using a controller, the A button doesn't confirm options (proceed to the next menu etc), the X button does that, which I find very odd, and while in-game it doesn't show the controller equivalent. Something like this (for example) would be very welcomed - Jump = A (Controller)/ Space (Keyboard).So if you're using a controller, it doesn't automatically detect it. It doesn't show you what the controller equivalent of each control is. I tried playing with a keyboard, but this game works best with a controller, even though the controls aren't completely apparent at first.I will recommend this game, but just a small warning if you're using a controller - It's not what you might expect at first, and it'll take a bit of time to get used to. I wish Steam had a 3rd option for recommending a game (Yes/ No/ Maybe) but sadly, it doesn't."

Really cool.This game garenteed WILL make you rage.At first you have to get used to the z keys and stuff. and what i think i know is that you (currently) cannot change the keybindings.Difficult would be an understatment if you would be talking about this gameI DO RECCOMEND

,Recommended,494580,29150406,Posted: 9 January,all,COV,"Satisfying fast-paced gameplay with amazing music. Most of the time i play my games with a video/stream on my second monitor or I listen to a podcast, but in this game the music is such a part of the satisfying gameplay that I just played the game with some good headphones.The Gameplay is fun as hell, i already loved the demo but the full game brings so much more..."

,Recommended,494580,35504226,Posted: 5 October,all,Linkblade,"Very good and challenging platformer for players who strive for perfection!Every level is about 5 to 15 seconds long. It is in fact a bit like ""10 Second Ninja"", but then a bit more different.You have to hit them buttons timed and fast to beat the pro time of the level and to collect all squares meanwhile.What I don't like here is that you can seperately beat the time and in another run collect all squares without the pro time to get the full progression achievement. There is NO reward for beating the pro time AND collecting all squares in the same run.What I also don't like is that you can complete the level with a very bad time and without collecting any squares, in short: being awful at the game and still progress to all levels in the game. Players who're not up to this hard difficulty can play through all levels with caution. But in my opinion they won't have much fun. This game is all about getting the best time out of a level by 40% skill (concentration, reaction), 10% wits (creativity and intelligence how to get the best time) and 50% endurance (repetition and memorising).What I could critisize here is that you literally imprint the level into your fingers for muscle memory and after several tries finally succeed. There is no possibility as in other games that, once you have the game skill you have all you need for what is coming, no, you won't be able to beat the pro time at the first try. Firstly you cannot look that far to plan your way and secondly you have to analyse the level to find out how to save time.Another aspect of this is the speedrun mode which activates after beating the 10 (or 9?) levels of a set. In the speedrun mode you run through all levels of a set in a row and try to hit the best time. Here the effect of memorising gets an additional big impact on your result. Just imprint these levels into your mind and fingers by repetition and finally succeed. This aspect never appealed to me as I find this to be more work than fun. For me this a waste of time, but for others maybe the real challenge.I'm not saying that these reasons/arguments make the game bad. I'm just saying, that this game is not for everyone.But if you like difficult challenges in a platformer like me then this game is for you!"
