,Recommended,494720,32221654,Posted: 6 June,all,MrFlufferTootle,"This is aGREATgame... to pass the time. The concept is interesting, and it is implemented in a fun and easy to understand way. Gameplay feels very diverse, yet it still maintains balance. All in all it feels very well thought out.That being said there are still a few areas I think this game lacks in. The main thing being replayability. There is only one game mode. In this game mode, you start off with a map/grid of sorts, and you complete waves. After completing a wave you unlock ""tiles"" from the map. There are different types of tiles, each of which do different things and interact with other tiles in different ways. When unlocked you have somewhat of a choice of which tiles go where.Having such a range of different tiles that interact and do different things, and having the ability to choose which tile goes where is what gives this game such a diverse feeling. But after a certain wave, all the tiles are chosen, and that diversity slowly becomes a mundane and methodical ""survival"" game (albeit there are enemies that can destroy tiles which adds another level of depth to the game).But there could be other game modes that add a level of replayability. A timed mode where you have a certain amount of time to get to the furthest wave possible. Or you have to reach a certain wave as fast as you can. And your scores are put up against other players. Or a gamemode where the tiles and enemies for each wave is predetermined and you have to find a way to survive, bringning out more of a puzzle-esque feel. Or some form of multiplayer gamemode. Even achievements or playercards would give it some sort of replayability.But as it stands now, there is nothing about this games that shouts for me to come back and play it again, unless I have nothing else to do and am just biding my time with something else. Don't get me wrong, I do feel as though I got my money's worth so I will recommend it, but that doesn't mean this game couldn't be better.tl;drProsFunDiverse GameplayEasy to learn Game MechanicsConsLimited to one game modeLittle to no replayability"

Everything about this is fantastic - every piece of it is intentional and well thought out. I would have paid $15 easily for this. Just dig in and figure it out for yourself, there are absolutely no 'cons' for this title."
,Recommended,494720,30340022,Posted: 5 March,all,Misery,"Well this game came as a surprise.  I love strategy games, and upon reading about this, and also seeing that it was inspired by Imbroglio, I knew I had to give it a try.  Glad I did, as strategy games like this are few and far between.As you can gather from the game's description, the core mechanic of the game is that when you move onto a hex, your shape is changed into the shape shown on that hex.  And with these different shapes, comes different abilities.  So your attacks and powers are dependant on the hex you are standing on at the time... your actual ""ship"" has zero inherant powers of it's own.  None.  You are completely dependant on the grid itself to fight back against the unending bugs.The true depth though, is where it then goes with that mechanic.  Each hex can gain experience.  For the three offensive hexes, they gain experience each time you make a kill when you started the turn on their position.  For the three special hexes, they gain experience whenever an enemy bug dies on top of them.  Hexes get one experience point at a time, and each time a hex gains 6, it can gain new abilities, however the abilities that you can add to that hex are entirely determined by which hex types are next to it.  For example, if a smasher hex (lets you attack an adjacent enemy without moving) is levelled up, and there is a healing hex next to it, one of the options available will be to give it the ability to heal you whenever you destroy an enemy with it.  However, these upgrades arent universal:  Upgrading a smasher hex only upgrades that one specific smasher... the others on the board are unaffected.  So each smasher hex could end up with different powers depending on what is next to it when it levels up.   This means that the board's structure is EVERYTHING.  All of the strategy is determined by it.  What's more, the strategy is deepened by the position of each individual hex in relation to other hexes, as the different powers each can gain really do make a huge difference.  And lastly, after each enemy ""wave"", a variety of possible new hexes appear on the edges of the board, and you can go and choose one, expanding the board further.  The bigger it gets, the more possibilities there are, but the complications multiply as the board keeps growing.That of course isnt enough though:  the other half of the game is the different enemies.  At the start of each wave, enemies spawn in a group onto the board.  They take two turns to spawn:  for the first turn you'll see tiny versions of them on the space they are about to appear on (and they are invincible during this) and on the next, they fully spawn.  After that, they can act.  This means that you have a bit of time to look at the positioning of new monsters and can use that free turn to react to the situation.  This is good, because these enemies get pretty nasty.  Basic bugs are simple, just coming directly at you and dying in one hit, but things get really wonky when other abilities are added to them, such as armor, the ability to snipe, or explosiveness, which outright destroys the hex it's on when the enemy dies (losing a strong, upgraded hex to an explosive foe really sucks).  The good thing is, there are ways to counter everything in the game.  THose explosive jerks for instance.  Normally, they'll ALWAYS explode when killed.  But if you have an acid hex next to another acid hex, and level one of those up, selecting the acid-based power available to it, that acid hex will not only strip enemies that land on it of their armor (which is the acid hex's default ability), but it gains the additional ability to defuse explosive enemies.  There isnt really any all-powerful combination though; the enemy selection is designed as such that they can counter you as well.  Paying attention to enemy positions in relation to absolutely every other freaking thing is important.The best thing though is that the game is very well balanced.  Of the 6 hexes, there arent any that are going to be rarely-used, all 6 are equally important.  The same goes for all the different abilities that can be gained by each type.  And there really isnt any single strategy that will always work.  One way or another, you absolutely will have to think your way through things anew every single time, and the situation just keeps changing througout each run.The interface is nice too.  Everything is easy to read, easy to spot, easy to use... it's all very intuitive, clean, and efficient.  And you can right click on anything for more info.The one disadvantage the game has:  There is NO other content than this basic mode.  None.  There's no unlockables, no ""campaign"", no other modes.... this even lacks a title screen, which I find moderately baffling.  This is effectively a game in it's absolute most purified form, and for some players, that could be an issue.  The game really is ENTIRELY about the core experience.  It reminds me of alot of older arcade games in that way:  those also had no seperate modes, no unlockables... it was just the absolute pure single experience and not a single thing else, with the goal being to score as high as you can (which is the goal here too).  So, this is something you need to keep in mind when deciding wether to buy this or not.For me though, that's not even remotely an issue.  I play alot of games that have that aspect.  And one way or another, this is just a blast to play.  And with each run being not all that long yet still very deep, it has that ""one more go"" aspect to it, and I expect this one will keep me coming back over and over again.   It's fun, it's deep, it's challenging, it's the sort of strategy game I really like.I do wish/hope that this can get released on mobile, too.  I'd absolutely love to have this on my iPad.  It would work just as well there as it does here.   But for now, this absolutely will do.   Highly recommended."

76561198076621310,Recommended,494720,30341463,Posted: 5 March,all,James,"Feels a bit like a browser game but the simple interface and controls hide a deep, tactical experience. Fulfils the following cleches:""Just one more game""Learn something new every gameSomething to fill an idle 10 minutesEvery defeat is your own faultA major aspect is choosing a new tile at the end of each round. You quickly move from ""What I could use now"" to ""What I'll need in the future"" to ""What and where I'll need to survivewhen things getreallyrough"". It's extremely satisfying to be saved by a strategy you put in place a dozen rounds ago.Aside from improving the AI, and maybe adding difficulties (and acheivements!) additional complexity would only spoil the elegant simplicity.It's not world changing or expansive but what it does, it does very well."
76561198201779962,Recommended,494720,30327284,Posted: 4 March,all,SabreKnight,"I've found this game incredibly addicting. This is a puzzle game, but it feels much more... tactical. Maybe it's because most puzzle games aren't out to kill your character. On the surface, it's simple as heck. But it gets complicated as time goes on. One mistake leads to your ultimate downfall after a certain point.There's so many ways this game could go, as goes for all randomized games. If you don't like sitting there repeatedly doing the same thing over and over, this probably isn't for you. If you like variance, then this would probably bore about as fast as rolling a ball back and forth. (But that's still amusing to me as well!)Like breaking your own records? Testing your tactical mind? Reptitive gameplay, simple yet so deep?Okay, I think I'm going over-the-top with this...I hope this review helps you check out this little 5$ Indie. It's a cool little game that I'm real glad I bought."
,Recommended,494720,30451348,Posted: 11 March,all,TooNu,"Decent puzzle game that has you thinking a couple of moves ahead as you plan out where best to move across the board. Set up combos of various tile types, that play off each other. It's a simple game to learn, but difficult to get really good at as a bit of luck is required for a really good run at it. It's certainly worth your time. (best so far: level 47)."

Similar to Chess, Checkers, and other similar strategy games, the mechanics are incredibly barebones yet the game still ends up putting you in complex situations where you'll die if you mess up. It's also incredibly addicting; I'd definitely recommend this for $5."

76561198086217970,Recommended,494720,33632681,Posted: 18 July,all,Dorkables,"Morphblade is one of those games that straddles the line between ""casual"" and ""strategy"": you can play through a quick game when you have five minutes of free time and you're not feeling particularly thoughtful; or you can set aside a few hours and try to best your high score as you try to set up the perfect combination of tiles to keep one step ahead of your enemies. It plays like some sort of calvinball-chess, each tile having its uses and drawbacks, and you need to use all of them as the insectoid enemies swarm the board and overwhelm you. I enjoy the strategic aspect as much as I enjoy its throwaway nature - if I'm not feeling particularly motivated I'll throw this on for a few minutes and play around, but when I really focus on it I'm pushing to try and get the highest score I can, working out the best combination of tiles and upgrades to keep the swarm at bay. Each new game is a learning experience."

,Recommended,494720,30303079,Posted: 3 March,all,FlamingYeti,"At the time of writing I have a mere 5 minutes in Morphblade. This is because it just released on Steam. However, I have put many, many hours into the various pre-release builds, and keenly followed it through development.To keep it brief, this game is a small, side-project made by Tom Francis, who brought you Gunpoint, is bringing you Heat Signature, and Floating Point is in the mix too. Plus other smaller projects. This is certainly a smaller project, a tiny game similar to the likes of Terry Cavanaugh, who made VVVVV and Super Hexagon. It follows the same principle, a concept, with a layer or two of depth and complexity.You could pick this up and play it for a few minutes, or play it for five hours, either is great fun. Is it worth it for the price? Just. As a polished toy, this is just about worth the couple of quid/bucks/unit of currency that it costs.In conclusion, I'd say this is simple, keeps you going with random elements, with many, many hours of fun to be had. Good job, Tom!"

Ends up playing out like a very complicated boardgame, think the End Game of Monopoly (placing all those hotels and houses) and Checkers with Tower Defense/RPG-like upgrade structure.  Quick rounds, 5-20 minutes, but it's an endless wave type game that gets more and more complicated, so rounds don't have a cap as far as I can tell with how long they go.2d graphics are clean, simple but appropriate sound effects, smooth performance.  Good price, it's casual, but a great way to kill a quick 5-20 minutes a few times a day.  Put this alongside minesweeper, etc."

Simple rules and the way these combine give it a lot more complexity than may first be apparent too.  Each game you learn a little more how to combine the tiles better to build the board to your advantage and maneuvre the enemies more effectively too as you strive to beat your high score.  There's only one game mode and I'd like to see the developer experiment a bit with more but at its budget price point I don't have any real complaints here."
