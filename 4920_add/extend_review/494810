If there is anyone who could develop an ETR foundation to be released on steam where people could make their own escape maps and upload to the workshop, you can actually contact me and I would help to fund it or even fund it 100% myself. No joke, I´ll stand by my word if this chance would appear for me. Think about it!This is what tempted me to buy my HTC vive, the opportunity to play escape the room games in VR. The problem is, this is the only VR ETR game. I like it, or maybe even, I love it. I finished it in about 10 minutes, but it was a good 10 minutes. For the price of half a pizza, you get the same amount of time to enjoy it. If there was a compilation with like a hundred different escape the room games for VR, I would be glad to pay 100 bucks for it.There´s all the old amazing escape the room games out there to play free online, like escape the telephone booth, the car, crimson room and so on, and if someone would just make the effort to contact the creators of the classic ETR games to be allowed to make VR versions, I would have the feeling of a happy kid which would compensate a crappy childhood."

Roomscale, no-locomotion, room escape is now officially my new favorite kind of computer/video game entertainment. The genre has really stepped it up since then, but this one still holds its own. I like the echo and the ambient sound. It has achievements, and some kind of alternate ending or mode I keep missing. Nothing about the puzzling is hard, but they pace it very well, and you will enjoy your first play-through.The price is a bit high these days, considering the competition.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=896713123"

Room scale exploration was invented for these types of games. This is the game I enjoyed most to be honest. I think ""quests"" and room escapes are much more suitable for VR than timer based, you are in the middle, teleport style FPS games. I really forgot I was not in the room, this was fenomenal.

Remember to turn them back to normal bounds afterwards!Otherwise I'm not going to say much about this - just mentioning what I really liked about it would provide too much of a hint."
,Recommended,494810,24473516,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Vacate the Room is pretty much exactly what it looks like. You get a single escape room to escape from, and also a second bonus mode that's more difficult. The room only takes 20 to 30 minutes or so to escape from (maybe more for the second mode), so $5 might seem like a little much, but actual real-world escape rooms usually cost a lot more than that and typically last about an hour so I didn't mind the price since I'm a sucker for this genre. It'd be nice if we could get more rooms in some way, but as-is it's pretty fun if you like escape rooms. If you've ever done an escape room in real life you probably know how different it feels compared to a video game escape room, and while the VR doesn't 100% replicate the feeling it elevates it to a point that I consider pretty close."

,Recommended,494810,25134416,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,V2David,"For those of you who are interested in room escape experiences, I recommend VR: Vacate the Room.  While the initial experience may seem a bit easy or short for the experienced player, it is very well done.  Overall physics of the game are very cool & certainly add to the overall game play. There are a few minor flaws.  Objects are sometimes difficult to pick-up off the floor.  While there is an in-game work around, it sometimes can get frustrating and decreases the overall immersion. Also while the room has a cool atmosphere, the fact it is so dark makes it a bit difficult in VR if you can't figure out what to do next.  You can ""replay"" the room with different and considerably more difficult puzzles once you escape the initial room.  This adds some replay value to a game which is relatively inexpensive.  I hope to see some more Vacate Rooms from this developer as the experience translates very well on VR."

For those not familiar with the trope, you wake up in some room unaware of how you got there and have to explore every little nook and cranny to find clues to solve puzzles and eventually find a way out of the room. VTR does this quite well and has a decent amount of interactivity between clutter and useful items. There’s also an EX mode for those who complete the game and want a bigger challenge (albeit in the same room). All in all, a pretty good VR experience for a $5 game."

Don't push --> touch it) After this initial frustration I had another problem: Beware that you need a correct tracking height which seems to be tricky to set up correctly with the rift anf steamVR. If you have problems just set it a tad bit low so you can abrely reach throught the ground with your rift controllers when barely touching the floor of your room.The experience was short but I liked the ending.

Make us reach the cane up there to grip the ladder or something then havethe camera fade out, When it fades back in show a rewarding view from the top (some dark alien landscape with eerie buildings off in the background would be pretty badass) with some slow eerie atmospheric music playing.. Let us look at this for 30 seconds to a minute and mind just wander. Not necessarily scary music, just cool and eerie.. like we have just opened our minds and have a stange world to explore. Make us feel like it may have been better if we stayed in the room at the same time though..I think this simple addition would take this experience to the next level.If you want some errie music suggestions I can send something over, just add me on Steam.Edit: One more thing, I would fix the moon as you can tell it is a lot closer than the skybox."

The puzzles are simple enough to be enjoyable.  There's no leap of logic here.   The in-game clues are spot on.

While it's kinda fun at first, you soon realize that there are no puzzles except a single one that requires you to think a tiny bit. Everything else is just a game of finding things hidden behind some objects, which is indeed kind of enjoyable tho.Personally, while it's not that expensive, I think the price is still too high for the 10-15 minutes of gameplay it provides. Because of that and the missing replay value, I'm going to give it a negative review. I wish there were a ""neutral"" review option.EDIT: After some good points brought up by the dev (read comments on this review) I changed my rating to positive. My points still stand and given I strongly tend to a ""neutral"" review option for this, it wasn't bad enough to justify a definitive ""no"" rating."

Your ""hands"" are just the Vive wands transplanted into the virtual world, and using them is awkward and frustrating, especially when you need an object to be in a certain orientation (a hand system as in The Gallery would work much better for this type of game).There is clearly the core of a good game underneath the flawed presentation; I enjoyed it, to a degree.

I'd say it's a pretty good demo for others to try VR as well. I had fun for the half hour I played. However, i'd prefer if the experience was longer or priced a bit cheaper. Even 5 bucks to enjoy something only once, for only 30 minutes, may not be worth it to a lot of folk. With that being said, it's far better than the lot of the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥content available for VR that is priced a lot higher than their worth. I think it has potential if the devs were to release more rooms to escape as DLC, and price it  just a tad bit cheaper than the actual game.EDIT: I left the review above and my only gripe was the fact of no replay value. For a $5 game, so perhaps I was being critical, but be that as it may, the dev actually commented and let me know there is, in fact, a second playthrough.TLDR; It's worth the money and is a fun VR experience.

It is essentially the same as normal mode, however the order of the puzzles is different and there’s an extra final set of puzzles that are significantly more challenging. EX mode also comes with an alternate ending which is better than the original, but it's still not great and doesn’t really justify the second playthrough on its own.Fortunately, the additional set of puzzles in EX mode is pretty cool, and it’s enough to tip the balance and earn a thumbs up from me…."
