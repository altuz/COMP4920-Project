I freaking loved it! I ended up Spray painting a pretty cool piece! Check out the Vive Spray video I made:https://youtu.be/_lf4Nfb5ez8Thanks again to the creators of this game for such an amazing experience it was super cool, and it has definitely became one of my favorite games on here! Thanks! I'm happy with the game as it is to be honest! Though I gotta say I wasn't a huge fan of the Color selection tool, it was still super cool! but I think it could be better! would like to see where this game is headed being an early access game and all! it has alot of potential!"
,Not Recommended,494830,34465572,Posted: 24 August,all,byteframe,"When King Spray turned out to be an Oculus exclusive, everybody got really butt hurt and stuff on reddit. This game appeared out of nowhere to save the day and everybody said he was going to be good enough and nobody was butt hurt anymore. I don't know about KingSpray nor how it compares to this, but ViveSpray is very, very simple, and too expensive for the amount of work they put in, and the butt hurt now resumes.If it only existed on its own, I could see giving it a positive review, but instead of improving on this title, the developer is now selling the updates you would normally be entitled to as a separate title 'ViveSpray 2' at nine dollars. You suck. There are countless art/drawing/modeling apps for the Vive, many of them free, don't pay for this tech demo, nor the 'sequal'. If you must draw graffiti in VR, there is a very nice free app on viveport.https://www.viveport.com/apps/902ce28d-c780-4d83-8dfe-6c6f9ef11780http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=904395307"

Scaling up (or down) the resolution clears the painting.  So you can imagine the frustration when you try to undo the last stroke, and the entire painting clears.. no way back. happened atleast 3 times in less than an hour for me, gave up after that.Max resolution (which you'll want to use) has very bad performance, if you move your head while spraying FPS instantly goes to puke-level..Further, there is only *one* level of undo, which tbh is not adequate for a painting app. Menus and colorpicker also lack visual feedback, main menu feels very rushed.Pick this up at a discount, or wait for Kingspray."

,Not Recommended,494830,28141472,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,elbatmanisimo,"In general, it's good fun.  But, interface-wise, it still needs consideration.Too many features are grouped into touches and hard clicks on the same controller, and it's easy to do the wrong thing.  This seems like it's done for programming ease rather than going the correct route of creating more menus (like Kingspray), or making better use of the fact that it uses both controllers and one only uses the trigger (for spraying).I always like to know what's wrong first, so ""Cons"" then ""Pros"":Cons1) It's too easy to accidentally change the resolution of the image when you go to click ""Undo"", which loses your work.2) Changing resolution starts you from scratch rather than scaling your work to match.3) You only have 6 save slots (2 per map)4) You have a huge wall to paint on, but there's no way of ever painting the top part, so why have it?  Are you going to put ladders in your living room to reach the top of the virtual wall?  Maybe allow teleporting up?5) Too easy to accidentally lose your current colour settings by touching the ink dropper with your thumb6) You use both controllers, but the touchpad on the spray hand does nothing, yet the off-hand is over crowded with options causing the above accidental clicks/touches7) Black paint won't spray on the subway car's windows - even though it's a different lustre (paint is matte, the windows are slightly shiny) so you can't see your layout unless you first paint in a different colour, or go over when doing your outline/highlight in another colour8) Could do with a paintbrush option to paint large single colour backgrounds, rather than spend ages colouring in the wall when you want a single colour base to work on - which is made more frustrating when you accidentally lose it by clicking the rescale button instead of undo.9) Remember to teleport away from the wall before you snapshot, otherwise the camera captures you opening the menu as part of the snap10) Snapshots would be better if you could take them from the angle you're standing at, or somehow position the secondary camera11) No open/save dialogs.  I realise that Unity is pretty pants for standard VR dialogs, so you have to make these from scratch (as I am with my apps), but I like to choose where to put my saves (usually on my external drive so they're technically already backed up).12) Would be good to have a help option if you forget the keys.  The explanation is in the map selection area and felt like a lot to remember on my first go.13) Setting it to the highest resolution (snaps just don't look as good as they do in VR if you export in lower resolutions...I found out the hard way...:( ) has very poor performance.  The screen rotated, stuttered when I started to spray, frame rate went through the floor.  If I had an old spec I would understand.14) Just noticed that it keeps changing one of my active colour to brown/red randomly (perhaps sampling the wall colour).  Luckily, one level of undo was enough to correct the problem15) A single level of undo...  I can't think of an app that has only 1 level of undo?  I imagine it's something to do with storing a previous copy of the entire image and replacing when you undo, rather than transparent layers/each spray being an overlayed object or similar/other method.Pros1) I feel like I'm spraying a wall.  You can spray up close and pull away.2) Quick learning curve3) Can rattle is a nice touch4) Cheap-ish (£2.99 feels more the correct price point)5) The developer is fairly involved with the community and takes comments on board (comments on Steam, YouTube, etc.)6) Not immediately obvious, to me, but you can see the colour you've picked by looking at the top of the spray can7) No paint fumes.  :DIt's nowhere near as complex or as polished as Kingspray already is (and it's not even on general release yet), but it has been a (mostly) fun introduction to VR spray painting.In general, it feels like it didn't take long to put it together, something done in someone's spare time.  Accidentally losing work has been a frustrating experience, but I'm glad this exists.I will be buying Kingspray when it's released on Steam, though.  It even has dripping paint.  :)"

A key for the new game to EA supported would have been more appropriate and acheived the same objective of letting people know that was some meaningful rework in the title.If ever, A clear violation of the EA social contract. very unethical!The developer seems to think that effort refactoring from his early learnings justified sticking it to the people who supported his Early Release Effort.  very clearly the title shouldn't have been split, given the modicum of new functionality.He also deleted multiple messages from the community from other EA supports who made fair and polite criticisms of his behavior.He could learn a lot from Anton Hand, the developer of H3VR on how to iteratively deliver a product, and how to treat your community.Cannot possibly recommend buying this or any other title from this developer.

,Not Recommended,494830,24462754,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,TonY,"I repurchased this game since the Dev is responsive and I want to support him. He is realy aming at making the game better. Currently I feel realy torn between thumbs up and down but at the end there is still a lot to work to do on this game/simulation and I feel like the progress is still slow. The Dev is realy going into the right direction with the changes he made in the last months but the game is out of the early access phase now, for me that coud mean no more frequent updates because he is satisfied with this as a final product.Things that are much better since I tested this 5 (!) month ago:1. Teleporting allowes positioning in playarea!2. There are now 3 environments, this time they are bright and fully 3D modeled so now you won't feel claustrophobic! (For comparison at my first review there was 1 paperthin textur wall in a dark non realy 3D environment)3. You can use barrels to reach high places on the wall, good idea :D4. Spray Paint Can rattles. Very immersive!5. Pressure-senstive spray controll! Yiiis!6. Aiming at colours is no longer a problem.But there are still several things I dislike:1.The feeling of spraing the paint is bad: When I go too far away from the wall there simply is no paint showing up on the wall even thought you can see the mist reaching the wall. At the max distance you can go (a distance that feels realy close like 30cm away from the wall) it will always make a perfectly round circle when you spray, spraying often feels like a round photoshop brush (not a paint brush made out of many particles) with a low repeat frequency (Google ""brush spacing"" to know what I mean). The worst part for me however is that the paint dosen't drip, no matter how long you spray on one place.2. The menu is still a mess:a) You STILL don't get a dialog if you realy want to clear the wall, I changed the resolution of the wall and whoops my whole art is gone?! No warning dialog or info about that, nothing. And you know what? That ""one click resolution change"" option that clears you wall is right next to the ""save"" button.b) Main menu: there are 6 Environments as a selection but 3 of them are 100% a copy of the other ones? I don't get it is there a difference, are this spaces for the next 3 environments? How about naming them?c) When you touch right on the left controllers trackpad you can pick up a color from the wall by aiming at a color with your spraycan with the right hand. This is nice but an explanation for this is missing on the new very basic ""text tutorial"" of the main menu! BUT here come the real downside of this colorpickler: it often happend to me that I accidentally slightly touch the pad while I spray with the other hand: result --> I have to pick my old color again and undo the last step I did. Solution: Hide the color picker behind a long press while you point at the wall with the LEFT hand (the hand where you have the color picker button not the hand with that you are holding the can)! Maybe the whole left controller menus shoud be disabled when you don't look at that controller? Guess the save menu and the color pick menu were not a problem because they are only showing up as long as you hold down the trackpad.3. You maybe already read it in #2 what do I mean with resolution of the wall? When I saw the 3 new environments I was happy to teleport around and spray wherever I want on that walls but NOPE. There is one given square area on the wall of each environment that allows you to paint on it. Thats it. No freedom, you are forced to spray on that given space even thought you can teleport around it and there was no hint for this anywhere: the first 2 minutes I was trying to find out what was wrong that I coud not spray on that walls?! Maybe its to make it work as a 2D pic later? Still I don't realy get this.4. Most of the Environments have high resolution texturs but are very low polygon and have bad shadows and no reflections what makes them look plain and unreal. Especialy the new underground train station disappointed me because you can't look into the trains windows (they are painted black) what makes you feel like you just spray on another plain non 3D wall that only shows a life size picture of a train.I hope @ciwolsey has a use of this up to date critical review and forgives me again for giving a thumbs down :-/Old review:http://i.imgur.com/V6KLfgH.png"

It is dirt cheap stop reading and just buy it. If you want to be convinced read more.Solid tool in development here.  As an artist and avid user of Aerosol this is probably invaluable to a new painter as you can switch up colors fast and flip the saturation and so on with just a few movements. Once you've been in it for about an hour the controls are super fast. Finding your color or matching a current one is pretty easy as well. I cannot wait to see what the dev does with this.ProsOnly Graff sim right now that is available.Fast intuitive color selection and alteration.Fades work reasonably well with practice.One cap makes for great practice for beginners teaches you to get closer and farther. As well as being able to practice hand motions. If you're a writer you know what I mean by this. Your flares and so on can be done nicely with this also.Teleport and a decent size wall make for hours and hours of paint time. Hopefully by the time you are over the one wall he will have added more.ConsNo pressure control yetLighting is very dark at the momentThere is only one wallNo UNDO is a huge problem and to me the only one I see at all actually. It needs to be implemented immediately as anytime the program bugs or the can doesn't work exactly how it is supposed to; you will end up with an error that cannot be fixed without redoing an entire area... This is not a huge issue for me as I can replicate what I did fairly easy. However someone starting out would lose their mind over that lol. And I admit even I personally hate having to fix my mistakes by redoing the whole area. Realistic yes needed no.That's my quick review and pro con list. Honestly there are NO CONS it is dirt cheap and if you take one look at the reddit or his comments in the forums it is a good developer and is open to ideas and sounds optimistic and hopeful for the project.

Twice already today I spent an hour working on something only to undo by mistake and then eventually clear my whole piece by mistake. Undo and clear buttons need to be moved where you do noy hit them by mistake. I gave up playing but will keep it anyhow it is awesome minus these two things. SAVE OFTEN althogh one of my two times was when I tried to save it. I hit clear instead SOMEHOW and I lost an hours worth of work,"

Still deserves a thumbs up, despite my experience, as I can see improvements in the future.Pros- Very fluid painting, Spraying at a distance has a wider and softer edge and feels like real flares. Gabencan. Longrange teleport(not 5m at a time)Cons-Crashed on me twice before I could even finish a peice, Rebooted and same happened again.(SteamVR issue) - 1 wall & 2 spotlights makes it feel bland(spotlights have an effect when trying to choose a colour if your in a darker spot). No way to re-use colours you've previously sprayed.Feedback for future:A more efficent way to choose colours would be great, its a little bit fiddly and hard to get back to a colour you used earlier. ( Once sprayed that colour, That can has a copy on the floor you can pick up and use again)Different caps for differnt spray effects.Undo function.Different enviroments and things to spray on(back alleys, trains, powerboxes)Drip effect"

What more could you want? Well, to be fair, some more options would be nice. Pretty much everything that has been added into tilt brush would complete Vive spray perfectly. However for now, it does what it does really well.If you want to graffiti on a wall without getting in trouble or spending a ton of cash on spray tins, then this is game for you!I just wish I was a better graffiti artist to actually get the most out of it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejQrVeWApVs"

But it's a cheap spray paint art program.. It's not kingspray but it's a good holdover.. Can developer improve yes... Undo feature, drips,  background choices, online multiplayer features etc.. Also top of wall is too dark... Thank you VIVE spray!!"

But more feels like a demo than a finished product. If you accidently press the up of down touchpad you loose all your work. NOT GOOD. The undo is only 1 move back, you can't redo if you i.e. delete the whole work. If you are going to wipe the work when changing resolution, then ask for confirmation first. I lost an hours work. Needs better paint colout selection like paint vr when the colours are on the can and you can chose that way from hundreds. Dont get me wrong awesome but needs more work. Palet interface for clours etc too simple.  The train windows are black and cant be painted black? what the ?. Not in real life they aren't. you can only paint certain sections of the wall or train should be the whole room."

,Not Recommended,494830,24311236,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,SevereCircle,I appreciate that the user base for the Vive is small and the developers need support but this does not mean its open season for expecting payment for a two week part-time rushed project with concepts directly stolen from another dev.  To charge for this is an insult.  Its no more than a five minute technical demo that wuickly loses its charm.  I lasted all of six minutes.  Steer clear of this until its a finished product.
