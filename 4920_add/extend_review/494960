,Recommended,494960,30812536,Posted: 29 March,all,IronPanda,"This is NOT a wave shooter, it's closer to Bullet Sorrow but with a distinctive art style . Much bigger play area too as you move through a city, sometimes atop cranes or battling it out on top of a skyscraper with armed drones and choppers dropping troops in front of you. There's multiple 'travel points' to choose from and cover like cars and storage containers (lots of destructible scenery) and i thought the movement model suits the game. It's well enough done that you can stake out an area without being 'dropped into it' without any cover. Unlike say Metal Assault, if you have a large play area you can use plenty of space for cover.This is a bow game and thankfully the bow feels really good. Plus there are bow options on the settings menu so you can customise angle etc.  Different arrows can make things easier and there are scattered health and energy pickups.I really enjoyed this and it's a delight to play a VR title that's so polished, you can tell these guys have made games before! Best i've played in a while and definitely worth $15.Cons:not much really. Die fighting the boss and you have to restart that level - at least i couldn't see any other option.Normally run a 6700k/1080@ SS 1.5 which i had to dial back to 1.2 as there was some reprojection.9/10"

Unlike most other bow & arrow games that are either tower defense or wave shooters, Twisted Arrow is a bow & arrow game where you're moving through several very different levels, using different arrows (explosive/freeze/trap/split/regular) to get rid of a variety of enemies.The level of polish is quite high as this comes from the same devs that made Final Approach so it's not a lone dev working in his spare time and it shows. Graphics are quite good and the feel of the bow is nailed perfectly, to me it feels very much like QuiVR but moving through the levels is where it's at.I had concerns about the movement system but after playing for about half hour I understood the design choices and they really built the game around them very well. If you enjoy bow & arrow games, definitely try this one."

Time Crisis meets Bullet Sorrow with an advanced ultra high tech Bow/Arrow. This is NOT a wave shooter, you actually have missions that require to teleport up/dowon structure, alley ways, corridors and court yards. Worth the price, the audio is pretty good, adding to the intensity. They put some quality work into this project. On sale as of this posting, don't hesitate.The only negative is not due to the game itself, but rather the visual constraints of the technology as it relates to the HMD, particularly when it comes to the enemies at a distance appearing slightly pixelated. This is the same dev team that created Final Approach, which is fun a unique vr experience in and of itself."
,Recommended,494960,30814994,Posted: 29 March,all,DanteFaust,"Great game.  Lot of fun.  Graphics look good.  Bow mechanics work well.  Nice choice of arrow types.  Would love to see them add more arrow types in the future that could be chosen on the trackpad from your bow hand.Turning the bow at a 90 degree angle to use the shield takes some getting used to but adds to the challenge.  You can't shoot and use the shield at the same time.I only played the first level so far but am looking forward to playing more. Well worth the price especially while it's discounted at $15 right now.  Feels very polished and is definitely one of the better bow and arrow games out there.For those thinking this is a wave shooter,  it's not.  It's kind of like Bullet Sorrow or Robo recall where you can point and teleport to different spots.  Not that linear though.  There are a number of places to teleport to on any given map.  Some people will not like it if they are completely expecting free locomotion but it works well with this kind of game.  If you could move anywhere it would take away some of the challenge of hitting targets."

The bow mechanics are solid, and the fixed-teleportation areas actually work really well with the game. The 6 different arrow types (that you always have access to via energy levels) all add a great feel to combat, and this was one of the games I actually got into ducking and dodging for. Even at medium difficulty, this game has had a few challenging stages, and it's been satisfying to continue retrying levels to increase accuracy and score. At the sale price of $5, this was one of my best valued purchases this summer sale for sure."

I've played the majority of VR archery games out there but this gives you some much needed variety. Your futuristic bow enables you to swap quickly between various arrow types, likes explosive heads, freeze, split arrows and mine arrows. Learning to use these at the right times is paramount to making progress. Shooting enemies is really satisfying. I plan to come back to this game again and again. Recommended!"

Fairly short, I beat the game in about 4 hours but this is one of the more polished experiences I've had on my Vive.  The teleporting is done by allowing you to go to a few marked areas and not just all over which I think works well for this style of game.  Shooting the bow feels amazing and the variety of arrows feel great and are all useful in various situations.  I would definitely pick this up even though it's short as the replay is very high.  Great job to the devs, we need more games like this on VR."

This game absolutely ticked that box for me.I love that instead of just being a wave shooter, the game has proper missions. It's a little bit short, but I enjoyed what it had to offer.

Its rather satisfying to take down the enemies. That's not all to it. In this game, you get various types of arrows too, which inflict various types of damages, such as a freeze arrow, an explosive arrow, a mine arrow etc. Another neat thing is that you can conjure an energy shield to protect yourself. As for movement, it make use of node-based fast dash teleportation.as the others has said, this is not a wave shooter. You will be make your way around the open environment, as you take down the enemies, drones and others along the way.

,Recommended,494960,31543373,Posted: 4 May,all,VooDooAddict,"TL;DR - Solid single player game if you don't mind fixed location teleport.----------------One of those VR games that's debatibly a Must Have purchase. Inexpensive well polished single player game that stands out from other wave defense archery titles. This is not another Longbow clone this is a full game.You actually move (teleport) to different positions and progress through a level. Don't just stay in one place. Inclusing some decent story/reasons why you are completing various objectives. (Teleport, not free movement.)Nice variety of arrows and limited energy giving some tactical choices regarding when to use the more expensive toys like explosive arrows.It's not perfect, as sometimes the enemies get unreasonably confused by your teleporting, and the lack of a checkpoint system means you are better off playing on easy if replaying a nearly finished level bothers you. Compared to other more expensive must have VR games like Raw Data, Arizona Sunshine, and Serious Sam, this offers a solid value. And a deal that shouldn't be passed up is it goes on sale.All that said, there are a few people who should avoid it; those who only want multiplayer, those who demand free movement locomotion, and those who almost exclusivly demo thier Vive to groups. Getting a new player familiar with the controls and then through the first level takes a bit longer then you typically give someone in a group/demo situation."

Gameplay was exciting and fun and the voiceovers were well-done.  I got stuck a few times not knowing what to do next, but soon realized that I needed to explore every available area... so the game pushes you to move around the whole board. This is a perfect addition to the bow and arrow games on the Vive. Very well done!"

It's story driven and you progress through new areas. I really like the visuals, a bit cartoony but it fits the arcade-style well.You get different types of arrows to use in different situations. Freeze arrow, mine arrow, split arrow and a few others. This helps the game feel fresh and not just an arrow spam-fest. I really likes the intro as well, the helicopter was awesome! There are other things you need to take out too, not just human enemies. Such as spotlights and mechs and stuff.I think the price is about right though some may fuss about it. I actually don't know how many missions there are so I won't judge based on that. Good game though!"

This would be okay if dying was a 30 sec setback, in stead of a 5-10 minute one.Then there is the lack of one-handed-aiming option (holopoint style aiming). For a bow and arrow centric game to not support that is silly. Personally this is what I hated the most, as I'm a seasoned holopoint player, and very fast and acurate with one handed aiming style. Forcing me to use two handed aiming feels like trying to play a fammiliar game with all my keybindings reshuffled."

However, two factors made me purchase it, one the speed with the developer answered my question on the discussions board regarding locomotion and second a couple of other reviews exclaiming how polished it looks.I have finished the first two levels and can say that this is a very polished product.  I just finished my first session and the graphics are amazingly good and more importantly for a bow game, the bow mechanics awesome, perhaps even better than those in The Lab.  I was immersed and felt like Green Arrow, kicking♥♥♥♥♥with trick shots, explosive arrows and just awesome aim! I felt like a badass.  This is very easy to get into, simple to play, and lots of fun.

,Not Recommended,494960,31608323,Posted: 7 May,all,Rafport,"It is cleary stated than is not a wave shooter, it's true but is not also close to a real first person shooter in my opinion. The teleport metod has some polishing, but reduces hugely your freedom in exploration (just a couple of points for area) and the level design discourage you to follow any secondary path. Many teleports are also badly positioned, where some appropriate locations (behind walls for spying and coverage) are rarely avaliable without to walk a lot in your chaperone.For his structure and the gameplay, Twisted Arrow looks closer to a shooter like Bullet Sorrow. The campaign seems longer here, but the overall gameplay is in my opinion worst and less interesting, and from the detail side the difference is huge, the low poly cartoon style in Twisted Arrow is not very effective.That said, if you love bow games, you should consider this one because this part (bow fighting is 95% of the game) is well done. But if you're buying this one hoping in a real FPS, something like Lockdown Stand Alone for example than share with Twisted Arrow a very close environment and a surprisingly similiar introduction, you could be disappointed. Even a game like Nock: Hidden Arrow (a dungeon crowler with bow fighting) is closer to what I hoped to find here, and a better overall game in my opinion. Maybe I am disappointed because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews avaliable just now, but it's hard for me to suggest the game at this price.Final mention, the game had subtitles in many languages, this is very good as most of VR apps are english only, and rarely subtitled."

Although the story isn't anything amazing I really do like the narrative and that you feel like you are actually working towards something instead of just mindless wave after wave. It feels like a normal FPS game where you advance, some new enemies and areas and you fight past it, which I personally like.The bosses are also pretty fun to battle against! They weren't super hard or revolutionary, but I definitely was sweating and really enjoyed the scale of it. As well as they have some strategy of quickness, correct arrow, and teleporting. My favorite is by far (mini spoiler alert?) big zombie golem guy thing. The scale of it was awesome and shooting down from on top of cars killing poisoned people aka zombies and fighting him with explosive arrows was just a fun experience! It was really immersive and made me feel like a total BA.Pros:Your arrows are pretty sweet. Bomb, mine, frozen, normal, and auto-homing.You can shoot barrels, explosives, crates, lights, etc. So a decent amount of stuff to shoot.You really feel like a BA dodging bullets since on some enemies it is hard since time isn't slowed.It isn't a walk in the park, even on Medium I have failed missions a few times at the end!Cons:It's short.Sometimes trying to change arrows takes pretty long while getting shot.Sometimes you will get lost in the level, but usually there are prompts trying to explain your next objective.TLDR - If you like ""The Lab"" longshot challenge then buy this game. The bow mechanics are solid and overall it's pretty enjoyable. Nice art style, good sound FX, and satisfying to kill enemies. I would expect someone to finish it in about 1.5-2 hours, perhaps more, on harder difficulties."

Teleport keeps the game honest from avoiding exploits so you have to get good shots off and avoid enemies with out just out smarting the game. Super powers are fun and they are offered at a regular pace. I'm glad I bought this game and many of my non VR friends enjoy the experience. "" I feel just like...

One of the things I've been craving in VR are some large scale bosses to really let me feel a sense of scale in the world. This game delivers on that very well.Traversing the enviroment was something that I was skeptical about at first. In general free movement is really nice in the majority of games, however I found myself enjoying the node based teleport system in Twisted Arrow. The levels that you travel through are fairly large and I found the teleproting rarely detracted from the game, in fact the I found the system to be a a solid way to direct player movements throughout the level and it never felt overly restrictive.There were a few very large bosses, if I had to guess around 2-3 stories tall. Most of them have some sort of weak spot that you need to go for and while you whittle its health down those weak spots can change to switch up gameplay.The worst part of Twisted Arrow is the game length, I beat the entire game in under 2 hours. While I think that it's likely that I will play this game again, I am glad that I bought it on sale. For the content that is included I think 9.99 would be a much more fair price.Worth the buy if you can get it on sale."
