,Not Recommended,495050,34118487,Posted: 8 August,all,Maple,"Very lazy port compilation slapped together with changes that make no sense.If you only care about Mega Man 9 and 10, and you're only interested in this because you want to play them on PC without resorting to emulation on Dolphin, then you should ignore the rest of my review and buy LC2 because you will be happy with it. Legacy Collection 2 is a great monetary value for acquiring these games. However if you're looking for the definitive play experience for classic Mega Man games, continue reading this because I have a lot of issues with LC2, especially regarding the very mediocre ports of 7 and 8 this contains.If you already own these games and don't particularly care about having an official way to play these on Steam, don't bother with it, the challenges LC2 adds are very lazy and pale in comparison to the original challenges Mega Man 10 or even Legacy Collection 1 offered. If you're primarily interested in this for Mega Man 7 and 8, you should also skip this because 7 and 8 are riddled with bugs and dumb changes. 7 and 8 really got the back seat treatment for this collection and are here only for the sake of filling up the game roster. It's probably the same reason Rockman & Forte was excluded, because this package really just exists to give you 9 and 10 with the DLC on PC.In Mega Man 7, Anniversary Collection sound effects are used, which seems odd but when you look at the port of Mega Man 8 you'll get in this bundle it makes a lot more sense. In Mega Man 8 a lot of the assets make me feel like this is based off the Anniversary Collection version of 8 which is notoriously shoddy. The bright blue background during the jet board autoscrollers is the design that was used in AC, not PS1 or Saturn 8. That being said screen transitions used are from PS1/Saturn and not AC, AC features different screen transitions. It's weird, it's some kind of almalgamation of PS1 and AC. There's some really esoteric stuff altered too that makes very little sense. Another example being the Gutsman G fight in 7. His charge grab attack should never be followed up by another grab, but on LC2 it's very common to see him chain 2-3 grabs in a row. I have no idea how this could've happened, but here we are.Other changes include the removal of the ability to instantly advance and skip text boxes, now you can only speed up the scroll speed of the text and advance a text box once all of the text is visible. That being said the option to turn on JP voices in the main LC2 menu is appreciated. Or at least it would be if the boss intro dialogue after stage select wasn't sped up for some reason. In the Anniversary Collection version of Mega Man 8 the dialogue for the second set of four robot masters is sped up giving them all a very high pitched voice. Legacy Collection 2 partially has this issue, except it affects every robot master. Although it's less of an issue because it only affects their dialouge from the stage select splash screen. One of the most odd changes to me was that they play the Wily Tower stage advancement screen jingle twice before the final battle with Wily, this does not happen on any other version of Mega Man 8.That being said all I've really covered so far is MM7 and MM8, because 8 is my personal favorite game in the franchise, so that was the main motivation for why I picked this compilation up. 7 and 8 are definitely not what Capcom or Digital Eclipse wants you to buy this for and that's extremely obvious with how many issues plague both of them on Legacy Collection 2.There was also some incredibly poor challenge design choices in my opinion. The goal of challenge mode is to time attack, right? Well they don't actually give you the hyper slider item or even access to rush bike, which doesn't make any sense. Playing Mega Man 8 without hyper slider past Duo's stage feels so slow, and even then not at least being able to /time attack/ and have access to an extremely useful item like rush bike doesn't make sense. Rush Bike was designed for time attacking, being one of the very few ways in all of classic mega to maintain a high speed while in the air. Some of the other challenges are abysmal though. The buster only challenges for both 7 and 8 suck. In MM7 a charged buster shot only does 2 damage, so bosses are very tedious in buster only. And the Tedium increase in MM8 buster only. Mega Man 8 gives all bosses 40 hit points, and this is a big issue for buster only. A half charged buster shot in MM8 does 2 damage to the first set of four robot masters, so the optimal way to fight the first set of four robos is to spam half charged out of their iframes. However the second set of four robot masters only takes 1 damage from a half charge shot, and they don't give you high speed charge in the buster only challenges so this makes them very boring and tedious to fight. It's even worse in the midboss buster only challenge because you recieve no healing, and the only real way to quickly plow through midbosses with buster is to constantly damage boost off them to maintain constant half charges. This is especially notable on Ururuun, Gearna Eye, and Gorone, and to a lesser extent Sisi Roll. Another issue with challenges is a few of the midboss/boss time attacks. These entirely come down to just grinding them for optimal luck it's very unfun, especially considering some of them are scripted to always start off with giving you a suboptimal pattern. The Bliking Time Attack is extremely guilty of this, he'll always start the fight with a tail opening, so it's impossible to two cycle him which is optimal. Also bosses like Bliking, Green Devil, and all of the midbosses just die too fast for these to be a real fun time attack. Most of the midbosses die in 2 astro crush uses, bliking keels over to it as well, and two cycling green devil isn't fun or skill intensive.Basically what I'm getting at with all of that is these challenges are extremely lazy and poorly thought out. I highly doubt they were playtested very much if at all. Although we're coming back full circle to when I said that 9 and 10 are the stars of the package. MM7 and MM8 both only have 10 challenges, while MM9 has 20 challenges, and MM10 has 35 challenges. Character redundancy aside, this still offers much more content to MM9 and MM10, regardless of how shallow that content may be.On the subject of 9 and 10 though they run quite well with no noticable differences or bugs compared to the original releases, unlike 7 and 8. 9 and 10 also include the DLC which is nice, and quite frankly it's a bargain to get 9 and 10 with all the DLC for 20 bucks. So if you just want 9 and 10 (which is probably most of you since 7 and 8 are generally disliked), you will be very happy with this package. However if you're like me and you love Mega Man 8 and to a lesser extent 7, you will be sorely disappointed. So I can't recommend this product personally because it doesn't have what /I/ want out of it, and overall I feel like it's quite a lazy barebones package. But you should know that if you're primarily interested in this just to acquire 9 and 10 with all their DLC then this is a great value and you won't be disappointed.EDIT: There is one extremely important change worth noting for 9 and 10. Both of these games run at 60 FPS on Legacy Collection 2. On console these games run at 59.94 FPS, this minor discrepency causes the LC2 versions of 9 and 10 to run very slightly faster, although if you're not speedrunning this change is irrelevant and makes a lot of sense.Also don't buy this for the leaderboards if time attacking interests you in any capacity. There's already an abundancy of cheated times. As somebody who has played several thousand hours worth of Mega Man 8 to master speedrunning the game, it's annoying not being able to actually compete with other top runners or interested MM8 fans who wanna try their hand at time attacking because so many fake times clutter the leaderboards already and it's only day one."

When are we supposed to recieve it now? It was essentially Megaman 8.5, and now we need to wait another 20 years for another Megaman collection to even bother? If ""Rockman & Forte"" was in this collection, it would more then justify the $20 price of admission and make this an easy purchase for everyone.Otherwise, this is a great collection of Megaman 7-10. I personally have been waiting ages for Megaman 9 and Megaman 10 to appear on Steam, so I am still stoked for owning this."
76561198019134697,Recommended,495050,34172083,Posted: 11 August,all,Ness,"This review won't deal about the games themselves and only talk about the Collection itself, its technical aspects and the new things it offers.Pros:-All 4 games play accurately without any noticeable input lag, except maybe a little bit in MM8.- I honestly can't tell if 9 and 10 are emulated or actual ports.-The aspect ratio is respected and the games aren't stretched to TV format like it was the case in the first Legacy Collection. Beatiful 1:1 sharp pixels are available. If your screen's native res isn't 1920*1080, things might be different though, as it seems it's the native res of the game and anything below is downscaling.Stretching to widescreen and scanlines filter are also available if that's your thing.- While I didn't like the challenges in MMLC1, the ""new"" challenges in this one are actually fun, especially if you want to train against a particular boss. In MM9 they allow you to battle Fake Man as Protoman, and in 10, you can battle all 3 MM Killers as Protoman and Bass, neither of which were originally possible in 9/10 so it's nice. Sadly, that summarizes anything ""new"" about those challenges, everything else is simply replaying parts of the games.The previously existing challenges of MM9 and 10 are still there, including yes, Mr Perfect, though none of them are linked to actual Steam achievements.- The only savestates available are checkpoints savestates, meaning you can only use them at a checkpoint or after you kill a boss. It's useful for MM7 if you don't wanna deal with the password system.- The museum has a few new art pieces. Most of them could already be seen in the 25th Anniversary artbook, but a few of them are new.Cons:- ""Full controller support"" on the store page is a lie. The only controllers this game natively supports are the Steam controller and the XBOX360/ONE controllers. Anything else, you'll have to either go through Steam's Big Picture controller support or install a 360 pad emulator. I went for the later and it didn't add any input lag.- MM9 has some sound issues. The music volume is too low, and some sounds get cancelled by others when they shouldn't (and didn't originally). Quite a few people in the forum also claim they have no music playing at all, but I didn't have this issue myself. Also a couple of sounds didn't play properly in 7, and in 8 the wrong music plays during the cutscene when meeting Wily before the final bossfight.Hopefully these will be fixed in the future."
76561198221520828,Recommended,495050,34109548,Posted: 8 August,all,Ωmega Zer0,"You already know these games are good, so I'll just comment on what extras the collection offers. From the very first launch of the game you get access to the entire soundtrack of all 4 games (9 and 10 have some really good tracks) and a gallery showcasing every character from each title along with concept art. Not only that, but you can challenge bosses from the gallery! Yes, I was surprised as well. Just hit X (Or whatever button/key you have binded) while viewing boss artwork and the game will launch you straight into a battle with that boss! It goes without saying that this is extremely useful for fighting your favorite bosses without traversing through the game, or practicing for boss rushes. For n00bs the game includes a Legacy mode that halves all damage received. The game also allows you to load an infinite amount of times from the latest checkpoint. I think this is an excellent alternative to save states. Save states are heavily abused and are undeniably a form of cheating.Now, allow me to entertain you with an IGN review. Samuel Claiborn complains that the collection only includes 4 games and was too difficult for modern gamers. I kid you not, this man thinks that $5 is too much for a Mega Man game, along with all those features I mentioned. Oh, and I didn't even mention that it includes all DLC as well. He takes a good two paragraphs whining about the lack of save states, (read my last few sentences from the first paragraph) saying that the game can't be played by ""modern audiences"". He doesn't even address the fact that you can infinitely spawn from checkpoints without worrying about lives. I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't even know the feature existed, considering this review was posted an hour or so after the game launched.Ranting out of the way, here's the link.EDIT: I originally had a link to the IGN site here, but mewt from the comments posted the review from an archive site. This allows you to view the review without having IGN generating any revenue.Here it is:https://archive.fo/bBJ0T"

As some other reviews have stated, this collection feels like it was lazily put together. I'm also disappointed at the fact that Capcom didn't include games such as Battle and Chase, Power Fighters, or even Megaman and Bass. The only reason I would recommend buying this is if you don't have access to any of the four games. If you do have access though, this collection is not worth buying as it doesn't really add much outside of the 4 games."

76561198001900781,Recommended,495050,34213455,Posted: 13 August,all,yagamikun,"Bottom Line:If you like Mega Man or enjoy classic 2D run and gun gameplay with excellent controlls (with a controller - Keyboard NOT reccomended), Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 provides a look at 4 of the more experimental games in the Mega Man franchise that should not be missed.What I'm not going to talk about:The overall contents or quality of each game - you can find that out in the product description, critic reviews, or dozens of other reviews on Steam.What I am going to talk bout - Version Differences:There were a bevy of questionable cuts between the Japanese and American versions of both Mega Man 7 (SNES 16-bit) and Mega Man 8 (Playstation/Saturn 32-bit). Thankfully you have the ability to play both versions in this collection regardless of region - and I've yet to read any review that shares why you should check out the Japanese versions of these two games. For the record, Mega Man 9 and 10 are largely the same between regions and I will not be covering those.To enable the Japanese versions, simply switch the language option in the Options menu to Japanese. While it puts the entire game in Japanese language mode - just notice what the options are or take a quick screen shot with your phone. The organization of options and menu text is the same across versions.Also, these games are largely playable in Japanese as much of the main text you'll need is already in english. For the item purchase section or story sections, the auto-save feature works on both region versions so you can hop back and forth between the two at any time if you need a refresher on the english text. Overall though, this isn't much of an issue as the story is largely unimportant and you can play through the games easily without any knowledge of Japanese. Okay, that out of the way...Mega Man/Rock Man 7:While the changes in region in this game are far less than Mega Man 8, there are some notable differences.-Boss Select: After selecting your stage from the select screen you are greeted with the classic boss introduction sequence. In the English version only the boss' name is displayed along with their signature sprite animation. In the Japanese version you also get a fun little quip about the stage. For example: When you select Cloud Man, his intro sequence includes the text ""Watch your step!"" Why these fun little quips were removed are beyond be. They were already in English.-Item Get Screen: After beating a boss you are taken to Dr. Light's lab where, in the English version, he tells you about the weapon's abilities. In the Japanese version you speak to either Roll or Auto instead of Dr. Light. Auto has some funny animation sequences durring these scenes that add some more personality to the game. Again, I'm unsure why this was cut from the english version, but interacting with the other characters is a fun addition.-Secrets in both versions: [Shade Man's Music] As long as you have not yet defeated Shade Man, hold down the A button (XB One or 360 controller) on the controller after selecting him and you will hear the map screen music from Ghosts and Goblins (another classic Capcom platfomer) play instead of boss intro fanfare. When you enter the stage the music changes to the iconic first level music from Ghosts and Goblins. This is a great remix that should not be missed. [Fighting Game Code]: I won't post it here, but look up online the password to access this mode. You can choose Mega Man or Bass in a 1v1 mini fighting game. [Cloud Man Stage] If you shoot the second floating weather bot with the Ice Cracker the rain will turn into Snow - which makes a later section of this stage much easier as the snow accumulates on otherwise invisible platforms. [Junk Man Stage] You can freeze all flowing lava with Ice Cracker to reveal hidden paths. [Thunder Bolt Weapon] You can use Thunder Bolt to light dark paths as it will apply a - rather impressive for the time  - light source that follows the ball of electricity across the level. There is a section of Shade Man's stage where this is particularly useful.Mega Man/Rock Man 8:To preface, Mega Man 8 had two different editions: Playstation and Saturn. The PS version was released first so the developers had extra development time on the Saturn version which led to a few additions and changes - Sadly, only the PS version of the game is the one used in this collection. Before I get into region differences, here is what you are missing from the Saturn version:-Cut Man and Wood Man Boss Battles: In the Robot Museum stage after you beat the first 4 Robot Masters you can find a secret room not far from the entrance where you encounter Cut Man - a Robot Master from Mega Man 1. This battle works much like his original from MM1 complete with a brand new, beautifully animated sprite and remixed stage music from his original level. In Search Man's level, Wood Man is an added mini-boss missing from the PS release. Like Cut Man, Wood Man has a beautifuly redrawn sprite and remixed stage music from MM2.-Different Music: In Tengu Man's stage the PS version music does not fit well with the rest of the score. The Saturn version has a much more fleshed out redition of this song which is rather awesome if you've never heard it. Look it up on Youtube if you want to hear the differences without playing in-game. Some other music tracks are basically the same, but given hardware differences some of the music sounds richer overall on the Saturn version.Region Differences:Voice Acting: Mega Man 8 is known for it's notriously bad voice overs. While everyone should experience how bad these are for themselves, the Japanese version uses high quality voice overs that really add some pop to the bland English version. Much like anime dub's from the 90's, this game is no exception. Also, Mega Man still has a high voice - but it actually fits the character nicely instead of being jaring, high pitched mess.Missing Voices: The English version also cut many of the voices from the boss encounters. In the Japanese version every boss has 2-3 different lines they use to introduce themselves when you enter their chamber - these are all but gone in the English release. There are also more voice samples overall durring the battle with the bosses. There are some other in-game quips that were cut from the English edition as well here and there. If you want the full voiced experieince, the Japanese edition is the way to go.Wrap-Up:There are some other subitle differences between versions like all Japanese versions of Mega Man (Rock Man) have a subtitle - Mega Man 8 is actually Rock Man 8: The Metal Heroes in Japan. Mega Man 7 is missing a screen when you boot it up that lists the first 6 games in the series and their release year - etc. There is one sad omission here: The Japanese version of MM8's animated intro was replaced with the English version due to an expired copywrite licence of the J-Pop song Electric Communication used in the original versions of the game. I highly reccomend looking up ""Playstation Rock Man 8 OP"" on Youtube to check out this awesome track. It is sorely missed from this collection and fit the action of the OP (opening) much better).Overall, this is a more complete package than I was expecting, and the emulation is spot on. Sadly, there is no good way to play the definitive Saturn version of MM8 without having an actual Saturn and copy of the game. No Saturn emulator works 100%, and the most popular, SSF, is met with input latency that kills twitch heavy games like Mega Man.Anyway, hope this breakdown of differences in versions was helpful!"

If you're a fan of Mega Man or even the old school games in general, then this is the one for you.One of my two gripes is on how the options are handled as it can be cluttered and confusing at times, but once you get the hang of it you'll thoroughly enjoy the adventures of the Blue Bomber.  The other one is on why in the blue bomber heck Mega Man & Bass was left out in this collection.  Is it because it's not a numbered title???Now when's Mega Man X Legacy Collection?

This should have been one release, not two. It couldn't have been that hard to put all 10 games into a single bundle. Instead, they released the first Legacy Collection as an inferior product to the Anniversary Collection that came out over 10 years ago, then put this out two years later to make more money.2. This has two fewer games than the first Legacy Collection but costs $5 more.3. We got the PS1 version of Mega Man 8 rather than the complete version released for the Sega Saturn. This was also a problem with the Anniversary Collection. The Saturn version was released outside of Japan, so what's the excuse here?4. Just like the first Legacy Collection, these are one-to-one ports with nothing fixed or added aside from the challenge modes which exist outside of the games. I'm running an i7-5820k and two GTX 970s, and the load times are no better on Mega Man 8 here than they were on the PlayStation. I suspect either these are emulated ROMs or the loading screens are there for the same of authenticity. Yes, they are very short, but the latter is still a waste of time and effort.5. Where is Mega Man & Bass? It may not be a numbered game, but it is basically part of the main series.6. All games dump straight to the title screen upon selection and skip openings.7. Proto Man DLC is missing from Mega Man 9. Bass DLC is missing from Mega Man 10. Maybe these are unlocks. I have only played through most of Mega Man 8 thus far and checked the others for the sake of this review. If that's the case, there was no reason for it.8. Honestly, I can't help but feel ripped off a little seeing as both collections together are cheaper than just buying this one at the time of this posting.Do I recommend this?-If you own these games already, NO! This is a waste of your money!-If you own the Anniversary Collection, I would get this if and only if you have not played 9 or 10 yet.-If anything I said above is a deal-breaker for you, then it goes without saying, but stay away from this!-Everyone else, absolutely!Out of these games, I've only played Mega Man 8 and 9 before, so I'm happy to have picked this up. Will continue playing and hoping they release a COMPLETE collection of the X series."

I assume Capcom is mearly using the same engine and porting technology that DE made for the first game.This collection is great especially being able to play 9 and 10 on PC, I suppose my only gripe with this collection is that you can't play the Sega Saturn version of MM8 which has a bit more content than the PSX version and the huge noticable change of Tengu Man's song, which brings me to another gripe of this collection.

All 4 games run smoothly with little to no blemishes but it's kind of a shame they skipped on Mega Man & Bass. Oh well, they probably just wanted to focus on the numbered titles anyway.Only thing I found a tad weird is that you always get sent right to the ""Press Start"" Screen when you choose a game. It's nothing bad (except in MM8's case where I think they outright cut the Intro Cinematic entirely) but it is a weird change. Some little nuances from the originals were also either altered or cut too, but it's mostly incredibly minor stuff so if you're just expecting the same solid gameplay experience then none of that has been sacrificed thankfully.$20 is a bit much for only 4 games (compared to the $15 original with 6 games) so, unless you REALLY want to play these games now you might want to wait for a sale."

,Recommended,495050,34137190,Posted: 9 August,all,DR.CEREAL,"This is a complete port that is enhanced from the original releases.Controls: Other than the Game Menu being on the left trigger(select button on Legacy 1), everything else is the same.Resolution: You can't explect a resolution of 1980x1080 on sprites  from the 90'sAdditional Content: The Museum has been consolidated into one menu eliminating hints and bios. Images are at great quality and resolution.Gameplay: If you have played other indie/retro platformers you will feel right at home with this collection. For those that have played the game(s) before you will feel right at home with some enhancements. Same retro guides you used in the past will still work in this collection.Sound/Music: AMAZING!!!! THIS IS WHERE THIS COLLECTION SHINES!!!! I can tell that the massive 3.6GB was mostly dedicated to the sound effects and tracks, they sound geourgoeus. I can't believe how good they sound. It's so beautiful! It even includes a Music Player in the Menu for you to let it rock while doing something else. Mega Man and Mega Man X is known making the best soundtrack/music on a platform game.Cons: No Mega Man & Bass. No Save State, there is only Save/Load Checkpoint(it will save at the start, mid or before entering the boss stage).Note*: This new saving method has an automatic feature which will save for you automatically just in case you forget so I think it's pretty darn good for those of us whom forget to save or run out of battery on our laptops.- Summary: This game is very well polished and is a great port of the classic Mega Man games 7-10 with DLC's on 9 and 10. If you want a game that will run on your computer regardless of specifications, look no further.I'm more of a Mega Man X fan and I hope to see a collection of the X series along with Legends and probably some of the Mega Man Zero series here as well."
,Not Recommended,495050,34650540,Posted: 31 August,all,Retrophilippe_QC,"I'm torn on this one.On one side, I'm glad that this collection exists. These games need more love and time under the spotlight, because classic Mega Man games are godly. MM9 and MM10 needed to be playable on modern platforms. I don't like ""mostly""downloadable-only games disappearing with the passage of time. MM7 and MM8 are interesting experimentations and great games on their own too and they cost and arm and a leg for real physical copies.On the other side, I can't help myself and not compare it to the first collection. The 2nd iteration is lazy compares to the first. Check other reviews for details about what Capcom did wrong compare to Digital Eclipse. The point is, it is decent but it could have been so much better! Also, not including Mega Man & Bass is criminal.Finally, this is a more personal negative point, but I find the requirements for playing this baffling. I have an old computer (still on Vista) but usually, I can play most games decently... but I can't play this game at all. It refuses to launch. Capcom stance on this (we will never try to patch this for people that do not have the minimal requirements) is the final nail in the coffin for me.So, maybe next year, when I will buy a new computer with my tax returns (I live in Canada, it's a fine country but we are taxed through the roof), maybe then I will update my review, but for now, buyers beware: this game requirements are ridiculously high. Don't make the same mistake that I did and presume that old games could run on a toaster. It does not!"

Now this is really a downer, I was on a trip without any data or interenet connection and I was really looking forward to play Legacy 2 on my laptop to no avail because I was offline.

Unfortunately the Checkpoint system is inferior to the first game's and this game is a skimpy offering compared to even the first collection, the gallery and challenge modes are pretty weak too and do not add meaningful content on top of the game"

,Recommended,495050,35071427,Posted: 19 September,all,Chdata,"Megaman 8 was great when I played it in my childhood over a decade ago and it's still a great game now.It got bad rep when it was first released because it was released in sequence after all of the 8 bit games, and was compared to those by people who are used to the 8 bit games.But as a player's ""first game"" in the megaman series, it's great to get into it. Comparing the sprite art and game feel/juice to today's indie titles, it's actually a very satisfying game to play.As a kid playing it on the Playstation with no savestates, it was actually a rather difficult and challenging game, probably because of the usual death traps seen in Megaman games.After mastering it as a kid and getting a lot better at gaming in general, playing it again in 2017 makes many enemies, especially bosses, seem so much easier than before.That is, if you're just trying to get through. It's still a lot of fun to try to do no damage boss rushes.Of course, I already know most of the game's secrets. And holdling a charged shot was a lot harder on a controller as a kid, so I always went with the auto powerup instead of the arrow shot.If you're not used to Megaman games or this one seems difficult, luckily for you the legacy collection basically gives you infinite lives with the autocheckpoint feature that saves your game at the start of every new area, so you no longer have to beat stages and the boss ""all in one go"". This is especially nice for stages like Frost Man's, with the rocket snowboard sequence. Definitely a lot more playable this way.Of course, you can also turn the feature off.----Megaman 8 is one of my favorites in the series. The sprite art is really nice and the gameplay is good.Over a decade later, it's still a very fun game.I also just love the voice acting for the MM8 bosses. And Dr. Light.Wily stage 1 of MM8 is still a ♥♥♥♥ing trainwreck though. Good thing this version has checkpoint saves.----If you actually have a Playstation disc for Megaman 8, there are some small differences, like having to always re-fight the sub-bosses, and the availability of the boss rush mode.----I've also played a little Megaman 7, and it's worth giving a shot too."

But here you get discounts so each game will be even cheaper.That said, would it be worth buying this colelction if you can emulate most of these games, with exceptions in some cases to MM9 and 10.If you never played MM9, in short its pretty difficult but just like Megaman 1-6, and if you never played MM10 its about as difficult but scaled back a bit with options for easier game modes.Really it depends on if you like the core Megaman Gameplay mechanics or not, because all of these games follow that formula.The odds of you disliking one and liking another are pretty low, most people dislike certain elements of the games, like Megman 6 being one of the weaker entires and Megaman 1 missing alot of what people enjoy from the series, but that doesn't mean they are much different.If you liked Megaman 2 you'll like 9 and 10 for sure, and this collection contains Megaman Games similar to that of 1-6 as well.Enjoy"

I never played the Saturn version of 8, and it's kind of sad that the PSX version of Megaman 8 can be obtained very easily (even the original psx disc) such as PS online store and Megaman anniversary editions.

Still more of the same over priced garbage with a face lift..You can technically emulate all of these games and could have for years but you know, give Crapcom more money so they can fund blockbuster failures like Resident Evil 7.I'm not even going to do a proper review on this one...It's basically Mega Man 7, 8, 9 & 10 wrapped up in a neat little package. They didn't just use an emulator with a front end to run the games this time around like in the original MMC1, they did a properly coded .exe file... The game feels a lot more polished and seemless than the original.People say the only reason to buy this is for MM 9 & 10 but there IS a Wii Emulator that exists so I'm not quite sure what the hell these plebs are even prattling on about... probably their autism kicking in again? Who knows.Either way, not worth the price tag, get it on sale. They're all classic games and they haven't changed gameplay wise... the only thing that's changed is the resolution scaling... which is a welcome addition.There's an added challenge mode that's a lot more managable this time around, unlike the ridiculous time requirements they had in the original MMC.... it's an easier game all around. The original MM9 & 10 challenges are still in the game as well so if you want to do those, you're more than welcome but there's no achievements tied to completing them all... only the new challenges.The only game that you can't save progress on is MM7 because it was still using an archaic password system on the original SNES cartridge. All the passwords still work and are identical from when you jotted them down as a kid. So using that one code to start right at the final Wily fight still works and will net you an easy achievement.The save structures of MM 8, 9 & 10 are still intact and allow you to hard save your progress. The game still has a save state feature but it's a bit more balanced. You can't just save a snapshot of the game any time you want and reload it, but you can infinitely respawn at check points in the game, so long as you choose ""replay from checkpoint"" . If you're about to run out of lives, just keep reloading your checkpoint for an infinite amount of tries.TL;DR: Same crap, different package, buy it on sale, it's coded better than MMC1."

Also, and this may sound a bit petty, but I wish they used the Sega Saturn version of Megaman 8 instead of the PS1 version.Despite the slight issues I have, this is a pretty good collection regardless and I would recommend this collection."

So I just decided to get this instead, that came with 2 extra games. I really didn't used to like the 8-bit graphics, and sometimes much prefer the 16-bit since I grew up in the 90s with the SNES, but this really isn't too bad. It even comes with the DLC included. Just beat the game once, or enter a code and you can play as Protoman, or Bass.My only gripe is that it has the PS1 version of MM8. The Sega Saturn version is far superior, you can fight Woodman and Cutman in that version of the game. Yes, I would have also liked to see the Megaman & Bass game included that was for SNES, but whatever it came with four games and was only $19.99. I want to support Capcom and hope they make more great Megaman games in the future!"

MM7 was a game I owned in my SNES so it was a piece of cake.Then it came MM8...MAN, it was so annoying at the very begining all that voices and dialogues... those ""jump-jump""-""slice-slice"" in Frostman stage...BUT, after playing for the last days, I cannot complain at all for this game, the graphics are awesome; the gameplay quite frustating sometimes but hey!, is a MM game so what can I spect but improve; and, why not, the voices are the personality of this game and quite funny as well (Astroman, wth man).They say MM8 is (leveled with MM7) the worst game of MM saga... I am still starting Wily's stages, and MM9 and 10 are calling... but I can say that MM8 is already a part of my favourite library (leveled with MM7 as well).Thaks for reading."

Being able to play Mega Man 7, 8, 9, and 10 all in the same package for what would be the price for just one of those games is great, and practically getting all DLC for 9 and 10 (once you unlock it, of course) was a blessing.Not including Mega Man & Bass was really odd though, it would have fit in perfectly and it's another title in the franchise that would have made more popular if it were in this collection, so it looks like we will have to wait for another rerelease (if one even comes out). Having the Anniversary Collection sounds for 7 and 8 is also a bit distracting at times, but nothing game breaking.That aside, having four Mega Man games with new challenges, gallery, and controls you can set to your liking makes this a really fun collection, even if the addition of Mega Man & Bass would have made it even better, and better suited for its price."
