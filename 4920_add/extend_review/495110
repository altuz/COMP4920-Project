76561198141404871,Recommended,495110,24944988,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,joan4003,"The galvanizing action packed conclusion of the Enigmatis series begins only a few weeks after the last clash with the Reapers, the Raven and the Preacher.  Though this concluding chapter is stand alone due the private investigator's narrative recap of previous events and the retelling of Reaper history, if one has played the first two installments there is an innate impatient enthusiatic eagerness to track the Preacher down and finish this battle of wit, perseverence, and destiny - decisively.  In the end there can be only one - the Preacher, is the last Reaper alive, and ultimately either evil, destruction and mass death will be released back into the world in the form of the demon Asmosdai or the tenacious private investigators will stop it.Storyline: A few weeks after the events in the American redwood forest tourist park Ravenwood where the Preacher defeated the Raven to become the last Reaper alive, our private investigator is back on his trail.  She knows now that there is only one Reaper left alive, and that the final Reaper's last and only duty is to sacrifice his life to resurrect his master, the demon Asmodai, bringer of destruction and death.  Now teamed up with another private investigator, Rick Hamilton, who for 20+ years has been tracking the Preacher and wants revenge, she begins at Maple Creek where her harrowing destiny began approximately two years before.  She must find where the last Reaper, the Preacher, has gone and stop him at all costs.  She and Rick journey to the highlands of the Himalayas after deducing the Preacher's destination, Karkhala Mountain, to stop his nefarious evil plan of ressurecting the demon Asmodai.  Along the way they encounter a scientistic team investigating an ancient monastery and discover an equally ancient group of Chosen guardians just as dedicated to stopping the rise of the demon Asmodai as they are.  Mystery, adventure, intrigue, betrayal, and murder are all part of this legendary battle between the arch-angel Raphael and the three-headed demon Asmodai.Gameplay: Smooth combination of point and click, hidden object puzzles (HOPs), mini-games and interactive game play.  Stunning artwork with a vivid pastel pallette, 3D elements (title screen, snow and blowing wind), and a fast travel map. A prequel bonus chapter about Brittany and an extra menu with replayable HOPs, mini-games, cutscene videos, wallpapers, music, etc. 3 sets of extra hidden objects: 21 morphing Tainted spirits (look like evil skeleton ghosts or balls of mist), 15 Feathers and 8 Flowers. As usual with Artifex Mundi there is an alternative matching game if one does not want to play the HOPs.  For achievement hunters: all achievements can be earned in a single playthrough. Yeah!Return of the evidence board:  This unique and exclusive feature of the Enigmatis series would have been missed had it been eliminated.  Part of the fun of this game (and the series) is finding the evidence and piecing it together much like a real investigator would.  The evidence board, now located in her cellphone, uses the pictures she takes and places them on this internal evidence board and is used for deducing answers to the relative and important questions of the investigation.  For those new to this series the evidence board will be an interesting mini-game puzzle whose clues will piece together the mystery.  For those who have played this series before the evidence board seems a bit weak since most of the mystery is known or can be guessed/ deduced very quickly.  There is a twist or two so do not count it out.Hidden Object puzzles:  3 different kinds.  Finding a item within a picture, Find assembly pieces, and the majority are very interactive list finds.  The interactive list finds require the player not only to open drawers, jars, cabinets, etc. but in many cases to assembly the find clue such as putting wings on a statue or assemblying something that requires more than one piece.  Adds to the difficulty a little bit but the interaction is fun since the player needs to figure out what needs to be done to create the list find.  It is almost a mini-game Hidden Object puzzle.  Quite fun and unique.Plus I swear the difficulty level slowly rises throughout the game since the last couple of list finds were tough.  Either that or someone spiked the difficulty level at the end.  Either way the last couple of HOPs are quite the challenge. My head scratcher was when the camera equipment fell all over the floor.  I am sure my difficulty came from the fact I had no clue what half the word finds actually were.  I know now since I had to look them up to figure out what the things were I was looking for.  Not often I run into such a head scratcher, and I am by no means putting that down.  I enjoy a good challenge and learning something new while doing it is always a bonus.Mini-games and puzzles: Mazes, logical, matching, recipe and a balancing act while crossing a downed tree.  Mostly standard types of puzzles but fun and well intergrated into the story line.This leads us to what I call interactive game play.  The puzzle mini-games in most cases are so well intergrated in the storyline the mini-game is no longer separated from the point and click elements.  The best example of this is crossing a tree log like a tight rope walker.  It is a mini-game but it is also direct storyline as well.  There are other interactive puzzles like moving a chest about to use as a climbing surface (not a mini-game or even point and click).  The line between actual mini-game and the point and click ""puzzles"" has been blurred in such a fashion that gameplay has become interactive. Very nice and quite inventive since the player for the most part really does not stop and think ""oh this is a puzzle"".  It is that smooth.I think I covered everthing.  Highly recommend even if one has not played this series before.  It is stand alone and everything is explained.  For those who have been following the series this is a MUST OWN game.  The INTERACTIVE boss battle at the end is epic.  Worth full price."

But I don't regret delaying my pleasure.Enigmatis 3 is concluding the hunt for the evil Priest initiated in Maple Creek and pursued in Ravenwood. Rick and you are nearing to stop the madman, however, you don't know his next destination. Returning at Maple Creek, you find that the Priest is interested in a mountain village, in the Himalaya...The story is full of twists and I liked it. There is no major plotholes and why I wish that some stuff turned differently, it was satisfying enough. As Artifex Mundi is rarely ending their games on a tragic note, Enigmatis is also ending positively. However, that being said isn't revealing who survives and who does not.The gameplay is quite standard: find items, use them, combine them, solve puzzles and clear hidden objects scenes. However, you have some actions moments (like firing your revolver, avoid falling from the plane, climbing up a mountain, etc..) and that's very refreshing. Everything is quite easy and I must say that I was happy to avoid puzzles frying my brains. The Evidence Deduction is also back: you find evidence and then it's up to you to place them in the right circle which is a question. That gameplay was used in Maple Creek to help you remember your investigation there following the memory loss and in Ravenwood to help you find why a beast was interested in a little girl.I also liked the fact that you can interact with some objects, like the radio in the car, to choose your own music. It's perhaps not something often in the game but I find these little interactions very nice.The graphics are quite good, I loved them. The fact that you're in an Eastern setting is also nice, even if you're not really confronted to it all along (as you have also the portion in Maple Creek and in the archaeological crew camp). But what I liked the most is the soundtrack, very fitting. I loved the menu track, played directly by the little girl with her flute.Enigmatis 3 is wonderfully concluding the trilogy. It's a must-have for anyone that liked Enigmatis or Artifex Mundi's work. The whole trilogy is marvelous and I'm sad to see that there will no more (though the gameplay will probably end in another game). It's like Nightmares from the Deep or Time Enigma: you're very sad to leave behind you a wonderful universe."

These are small additions to the traditional hidden objects puzzle but it does make them a bit more varied and interesting.If you don't like hidden objects puzzles, there's an option to replace them with 'pair-matching minigames'. You know, the memory game that requires you to remember what picture is on the bottom side of some cards, in order to eventually click on two identical cards and remove these from the board. The goal is to remove all the cards from the board. Contrary to the second game, there are no Steam Achievements for the pair-matching minigames this time.Enigmatis 3: The Shadow of Karkhalaonly has 11 hidden objects puzzles. That's a lot less than the second installment had, which already had considerably less than the first game in the series.So this time, you'll be solving a larger variety of puzzles. Of course, there is also the classic exploration and collecting items to use on other items to further the story, like in other point & click adventure games.The storyThe story is a direct continuation of the story from the previous Enigmatis games, so I recommend you do...http://store.steampowered.com/app/284750/http://store.steampowered.com/app/284770...and play them in order. In this third and final chapter, our detective is still chasing the mysterious preacher with the help of Richard Hamilton, a private investigator she met in the first installment.The story of the third chapter is only great as a conclusion to the story of the trilogy as a whole. But by itself, the story ofEnigmatis 3: The Shadow of Karkhalaisn't that good, really, and it's certainly the weakest of the three games. New players thinking of picking up this third Enigmatis game without playing the prequels shouldn't bother because they will be utterly disappointed. The storyline set up in the previous installments is summarized inThe Shadow of Karkhalabut it isn't explained well, so you'll be more confused than anything else. Also, you won't understand the motivation of the two protagonists and the antagonist at all, so you won't feel involved with the story.The difficulty and length of the gameThe way to advance in the game, be it through adventuring or through solving puzzles, is always logical so it's never frustratingly hard. Should you find yourself stumped, there's a hint button that you can press. It will point you to the next point where action is required, or allow you to skip a puzzle altogether.Most of the puzzles inEnigmatis 3: The Shadow of Karkhalaare fun but a bit easy, which takes away the satisfying feeling of being challenged that the previous two games offered.It takes about 7 hours to complete the game. After that, there is a bonus chapter you can play through, which will take you less than an hour.On Steam's extra featuresEnigmatis 3: The Shadow of Karkhalahas 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.There are 34 Steam Achievements. The practical and technical problems with the achievements from the second installement are gone (seemy review ofEnigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwoodfor more on that), so much like in the first game we're left with achievements that motivate the player to not use the hint button, to not just click around like crazy until something happens, and so on. The 'collections' achievements are back, too, but they are a lot more difficult this time around. They are optional, of course, but they add a bit more challenge to the game for those who want the achievements, which is what I think Steam Achievements are supposed to be like."

I m just sad that this series is over.P.S:- Why can't Artifex Mundi put so much details storywise, locationwise,graphics wise in all their games.Engimatis and Grim legends Series are best and my most fav games of Artifex & Everytime after playing this game when i play other games of artifex  i felt let down with their work.I hope Artifex soon create another awesome series."

,Recommended,495110,28626588,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Mifititi,"Recommended.As the last chapter in the Enigmatis trilogy, this wraps up all the loose ends. That in itself makes this game satisfying as you finally find out what happens to our protagonist and her friends and enemies alike. This installment still manages to twist and turn the story to keep you interested. Some scenes do seem a bit similar to the previous games but not enough to bother too much.I must say that I actually enjoyed the characters and their interactions. The characters have CHARACTER, they aren't there to just help you along. Especially after three games, I've grown quite fond of some characters. I doubt that the personalities leave you completely disinterested - at least, not all of them.The snowy backgrounds still bring out a lot of colorful locations. Actually, the colors stand out even more because of it. The scenery of the game isn't as dark as in the previous ones, which may put off some people. I personally liked it, not just because I like colorful backgrounds but because it symbols the end of this journey. As for the animation, I have mixed feelings about it. I liked how the art seemed even more realistic, especially when it came to the humans. They still didn't change their expressions that much to show how they felt.Gameplay was a bit frustrating. If you play to get all the achievements in one go, you must be extra careful or you might miss something. I had to restart the game many times because I kept forgetting to pick white feathers or morphing objects that I didn't have any access to once I realized my mistake. Luckily, if you miss few feathers at the beginning of the game and you restart it, you can get the achievement quite easily.In the end, I enjoyed this game and the journey from the first to the last installment. Especially since I managed to get all to achievements after such difficulty and was left satisfied. This series is a great add to the collection of any hidden object gamers, new and old. Whether you buy it on sale or not, it's worth it."
,Recommended,495110,30063537,Posted: 20 February,all,Xander77,"This is a genuinely amazing HOG. The story, with all its accouterments, takes a proper leap forward in this one.Fair warning -videoand paragraph both will have spoilers. So, if Enigmatis 1 had a terrible (typical) HOG excuse plot, while Enigmatis 2 had a fairly engaging story and scenes, occasionally marred by stilted acting and action scenes involving two poser figures being ineptly puppeteered.  Enigmatis 3, meanwhile, has a really solid story, backed by good voice acting and gorgeous scenery. A bit of an Uncharted ripoff, complete with a Tibetan setting, but still. It even had a plot twist I didn't see coming.Good puzzles, both in the ""proper puzzle"" and adventure game sense. The game has enough content that itnever reuses HOS'which I have literally never seen an HOG game do before. The sole (though repeating) adventure game logic issue was with the game insistence that a lighters flame can easily melt metal and ice.The deduction board is kinda underused - I think it might not even be mandatory this time around. The detective work you had to do via deductions was fairly neat - poorly implemented in the first game, but just about perfect in the second. Having it as a diversion rather than a core element kinda detracts from the uniqueness.The game allows you to fine-tune exactly how quickly you want your hints to recharge, and other common HOG elements - something I advocate including in pretty much every game, yet is very rarely actually done.Heavily recommended. If you feel as though you need to catch up to the series, start with Enigmatis 2 - it tells you everything you need to know about 1 without being forced to play it."

As the final game in the Enigmatis trilogy it delivered and I find it hard to pick something for the CONS section. The devs polished this one really nicely and it shows. It is just right for people who do not usually play point&click games to get into this genre, though I really recommend playing the first two games first. The story is okay, although a bit cheesy at times, and this time with a proper ending. I recommend getting this if you want a relaxing game full of little mini-games that make you think.

The main game is a point & click adventure, but combined with 3 types of sub-games. First there are puzzles, which are usually not too difficult to solve. Second there are the hidden object games, where you need to find a list of objects in a single scene. And third, a simple pairing game if you don't like to find the hidden objects. I always plays these games on the most difficult level to at least have some challenges.This is one of the most beautiful HOPA (hidden object puzzle adventure) out there on Steam! If you're new to this game genre, give this a try. Not a must-play game, but quite entertaining. The voice acting can be cheesy at times, but hey, this is casual gaming!Admittedly, I found this game feeling alot shorter than the first two games in the Enigmatis trilogy.Score: 8/10Pro:+ nice graphics+ steady game progress+ thrilling story+ additional bonus storyContra:- feels shorter than previous 2 games...- HOPA = no replayability"

To say I was disappointed would be understating it. First off the game quality is crap. It has problems loading and then glitchs. I can honstly say the problem isn't my laptop as it can handle skyrim at full specs. Plus I've seen reviews with other people mentioning this problem.The plot of the game pretty much rehases the previous 2 games for a good 3/4 of the game. There is barely anything new. The characters get a big downgrade espeically preacher who had been such a great villain. When the climax of the game came I wanted to scream because this game didn't even last half as long as the previous two entries into the series. So I was more then shocked when it ended so quickly. After 2 entries into this universe this honestly had me dispapointed that i had played the series at all. It just felt so rushed and a lot of important things weren't explained.The puzzles weren't challenging either. If you have to get this to know how the series ends I'd really reccomend waiting until it is on sale. Otherwise I say this is a skip.I give it 4/10

You get a clue for this showing half the runes and you have to go print a photo to get the other half.   The thing is, the first clue gives you all you need to know and I had the box perfectly aligned at that point.  Yet wouldn't open.  I go get the photo for the other clue, box still won't open, even though everything is in perfect position.  So I have to toggle one of the pieces around to first make it wrong again, and then make it right again and finally the box opens.

The other ones she got were late in the game.Cool Stuff:* It was obvious that the budget for animation went through the roof, by far the prettiest game in the trilogy.* You get a buddy to help you move and lift things and interact with puzzles.* Have a cell phone to take pictures with so you don't leave evidence and conclusions where anyone can just get at it and muck it up (is this woman actually a detective tho? Like, how with the international juristiction??) so that's an upgrade all around.* There were a variety of puzzles.* Detective had a lot less head injuries this game than others, so she made deductions a lot faster.Problems:* The Asmodai v. Raphael story was told so many times in so many ways this game that I was ready to burn the monastary down.* there were some bugs. At once point I used the hint button and it kept redirecting me to look at this broken lighter I had already checked, three puzzles before I had anything to fix it with. Also the back/direction arrows weren't as clear this game.* The ending. The first two games ended spectacularly, a cliffhanger that felt conclusive - like there wouldn't be other games. But there were more games. And the ending on this one? For both the main game AND the side story were just downers.* The continuity between the side story and the main game was broken by a few scenes which were unnecessarily different* Those pictures of Brittany in CG glory next to real-life children.If you're dying to know what happens in the end of this trilogy, then I'd say play this game. The story isn't that amazing, but the puzzles are pretty good and the graphics fun to look at."

The first 2 games were incredible! This one? Boring, dule, voice acting is awful, and the scenes just aren't visually appealing. I really believe EVERYONE should play the first 2 games, unfortunatly this one should be skipped!"

The storyline is on point, the voice acting is good, and the hidden object scenes contain items that actually make sense to be there.The only drawback is that the cinematic scenes are very slow to load, which really detracts from the story."

You then proceed to solve the usual kinds of puzzles while chasing down the bad guy. I really like the style of puzzles in this series. In this game they tend to be on the easier side except for finding the special feathers and flowers, and especially the morphing objects, which I had a lot of trouble noticing. Overall the series is quite enjoyable. I recommend playing these games one after another for continuity."

76561198025609388,Recommended,495110,33737205,Posted: 22 July,all,sfriedberg,"The Enigmatis series is definitely more than basic HOG material, and Shadow of Karkhala actually plays more like an adventure game, with a real story, than a basic HOG.  If it weren't for one problem, I'd recommend it without reservation.  As it is, I have to caution you about the problem and let you judge how much an issue it will be for you.I'm afraid fellow reviewer Mugros is right.  8 to 12 second black screen load times, often for just 1 or 2 seconds of video.  It's hard to think of a better destroyer of mood, whether it's tension, excitement or fear, when you have to just twiddle your thumbs waiting for the game to continue.  The climatic boss battle is interrupted by about six of these loading delays, including a back-to-back pair where you get one line of dialog with no visuals before the 2nd delay kicks in.  This just drains the thrill right out of it.  He's also right about the frame rate issues in the bonus story.  I also noticed that this particular game is very slow to shut down, taking about 15 seconds.  This delay is consistent when playing online or offline.My system has 24 cores, 64GB, and comparably fast and large hard drives.  Murgros was using a solid-state drive.  It's hard to see how our systems could be considered under-powered for a 2D adventure game with occasional video overlays!"

My system is HP p6130f, running Linux Mint 18.2 and steamOS.  The first two games (Enigmatis 1&2) ran flawlessly on this same system.UPDATE:  I finally was able to finish the game, although it required scores of hard computer resets and reboots.  Saving the game was very challenging at most locations throughout the game, especially at the Cabin and the Base Camp scenes.  Almost totally unplayable.  It was difficult to enjoy the game when the real puzzle was just trying to keep it from dying.The root problem here is probably my video memory, which is specified at 256 MBytes (shared), the same as the game requirements.  Given that I'm running Linux, not Windows, it probably isn't quite enough and I should reduce my display resolution, but that ruins the experience.   I've been wanting to upgrade my computer anyway, so this is probably the motivation that causes me to do it.FINAL UPDATE:  I reduced my screen resolution and that did the trick.  The game is playing flawlessly now.  I've also ordered another CPU/Motherboard/memory/video to upgrade my 8 year-old computer to a more modern configuration (8 cores and 16 GByte memory).  I want to be able to use the full resolution of my very fine monitor.I'm changing my recommendation for this game from NO to YES.  Just don't play it on older hardware."

The intro and start of the game is pretty exciting, because so much happen in so little time. Just perfect!As usually the graphics and music are good, and the story is how it usually is, a bit predictable, but not boring. To make this review a bit shorter I am just gonna say that I feel that all though it's a well made game, with unique locations and an interesting story, I think some of the elements in the game are too easy. Not playwise, but plotwise, I feel the solution often is solved easier than it realisticly would have been, and to be honest, my character should have died around 4-5 times already before the game ends. The game was pretty entertaining though, and I'll guess this is just how the games are made."
