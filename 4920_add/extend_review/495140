If you played the game recently it should be available on “Recent Applications”.  Change the graphics settings to “High Performance”.If your hardware is incapable of delivering 60 fps constantly, then it is recommended to turn off MSAA, FXAA, and reduce the graphics settings. If you are still experiencing slow motion, then you should play the game in 30 fps. To do this simply navigate to the game directory, open “config.ini” and change the fps=1 to fps= 0.*This is applicable to all games including the other Storm series.If this solved your issue, please like it so others can see it."
,Recommended,495140,34847340,Posted: 9 September,all,Remeii,"Before I start the review I just want to say that this game was RARE. I have played NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 FULL BURST, I played Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, and lastly NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. I never played Storm 2 neither Storm 1, I didn't have a PS3 at that time, I had a XBOX 360. I always heard people say that this is ''THE BEST STORM GAME'' I kept seeing that over and over the more I would look up Storm 1 stuff. Finally, from the power of Naruto Storm Legacy, I am able to finally test out ''The best Storm game''Did it suprised me? or did it dissapoint me? This game suprised me... This game is a really god damn good Storm game.The game has a few things the future storm games removed: Jutsu Clashes, Wall Running, Longer Ultimate Jutsus, Button inputs for Ultimate Jutsus, and The super punch. In terms of the game port. It's amazing, It's an improved version from the PS3 version. Not only does it give the game 60FPS but some more graphics settings. Lets talk about the gameplay.I've seen alot of people in the Naruto Storm 1 and 2 Discussion forums say the games are ''slow'' The game doesn't have to be fast to have good gameplay mechanics, whenever I play this game, I get a feeling of thinking before acting. Which I mean.. that's essential for EVERY fighting game. The players that complain about Storm 1 being slow are probably players that just straight spam Chakra Dash in Storm 4. Just because the gameplay is slower than Storm 4 doesn't make the game bad. Character movesets are unique in this one, some of the characters don't have the same movesets in the future games. Not only that, but in this game, everyone has a side combo which the future games removed. The Ultimate Jutsus are amazing, they're cinematic, long, and really cool looking. I also love the way the Ultimate Jutsus work in this game, from my knowledge Storm 3, Generations, and Storm 4 whenever you would press Y Y B to do an ultimate jutsu it would make it so god damn obvious. What I mean by that is, for example if you do an Ultimate Jutsu in the newer Storm games, you see that the screen turns dark and freezes MAKING IT WAY TO OBVIOUS THAT AN ULTIMATE JUTSU IS COMING.In Storm 1 however that's not the case all that happens is your character will get a blue flashing aura around them.I also love the way you use your ultimate jutsus, In the future storm games it's most either Spamming the Ultimate Jutsu and praying that it hits while your opponent's substitution is all used up, or combo cancel into an Ultimate Jutsu, However in Storm 1 landing them is pretty unique, I think a great example is Sasuke's Ultimate Jutsu, He appears behind you and kicks you, Ofc spamming it will make it obvious, However If someone is charging their chakra, casting a ninjutsu, trying to awaken, that opens a great oppurtunity to use it and deal some damage. Speaking of damage, the Ultimate Jutsus in this game do a♥♥♥♥♥♥TON of damage, I think it takes 2 or 3 Ultimate Jutsus to take your opponent out or get their health extremly low. Anothor thing with the Ultimate Jutsus is that there are button inputs, Theres a type of clash once your opponent gets you into a Ultimate Jutsu. Depending on how fast  you and your opponent are inputing the buttons correctly you will be able to dodge an Ultimate Jutsu. However, there is a catch. The person who catches you in the Ultimate Jutsu can mess up 2 or 3 buttons and still get you into a the Ultimate Jutsu, The person who got CAUGHT into the Ultimate Jutsu mess up even ONE button they won't be able to dodge it. So don't try rushing and mashing buttons randomly. In this game, you can still combo cancel, you can cancel into a jump dash for an air combo or a ninjutsu. Now for the big thing that bugs alot of players, the subsitution mechanic, oh boy... I'm saying this now the substitution mechanic is not broken, neither is it hard to do.The way you do substitution in this game is once you get hit press the guard button. Alot of players always say to spam the guard button until you get out of a combo. That is SO NOT HOW IT WORKS. You learn the rhythm of a character's combo, the timing is pretty crucial but practice makes perfect. I found myself substituting way more often if i followed the characters combo rhythm rather than spamming the damn guard button. I know beginners will feel like it's crap and pretty much say the game is trash just because of this but it just requires some timing and practice, don't expect to master this mechanic in a simple day or two, it takes time and practice but trust me, you will get a feel for it. As for game content, there is a fair amount, the one thing people love to bring up about this game is the free roam.My goodness is it amazing. Yeah sure, you can only move around in the village. But the stuff you can do is pretty coolI always do find myself going back into Ultimate Mission Mode just to mess around in the village.Overall, this game is definetly worth 20 dollars, atm I seriously can't put this game down, I'm playing it everyday at this point, I have Storm 4 in my library as well, but I sure am not having much fun with it as I am with Storm 1."

The adventure mode was locked to 40-45fps on Storm 4, but why? Also, I can only turn on either FXAA or SMAA, I can't have both on at the same time. MSAA is fine though."

The added 60 fps definitely makes a difference. The map looks beautiful and makes me crave a real solid Naruto mmo. Also, if your not getting mission xp it's because you got to run around the map to find out those that give D-rank missions first to complete. Just an fyi from a person who made the rookie mistake of trying S and A rank missions on insane mode to get xp and coming up dry."

Each missions has bonus objectives for a bit of challenge if you're looking for that. some of them get a little annoying but for the most part those are finished within 2 or 3 tries. Each missions goes from D-S D being easy and S being very hard. those are balanced for there respective rankings. fun boss fights with fun scaling in terms of size which proves to make you feel like you're really fighting a big boss. these have been the first tailed beast to one of jiraiya's frog summons.  all and all i'd say thet improved over the games however the first one is worth playing if you're a real naruto fan.

,Recommended,495140,34520507,Posted: 26 August,all,Aprisothy,"It's fair to give this game mixed reviews. All in all it's meant to appeal to naruto fans and people that can enjoy older games.  As a fighting game it'll feel dated regardless of whether or not you've kept up with the scene for any amount of time, and the story mode feels like a complete drag.  However, if you're a fan of the series you'll be able to take a bite of it, and if you can get down with the older game progession system and mechanics you'll be able to take on most of it in a few sittings.  It's worth noting that while this game has been remastered graphically (and it looks great for the most part) the menus are just AID's and hella confusing, and the tutorials don't really teach you much that actually matters,  There are optimization issues as well but nothing that feels gamebreaking or impairing.  7/10 - would recommend highly to a fan of the series  11/10 - would get destroyed by the AI again and again and again"
,Recommended,495140,34512720,Posted: 26 August,all,OneMoreShepard,"Okay, I've taken an oath not to buy anything ever again from Bandai or CC2 after the complete ♥♥♥♥up with launching NUNS4 and ♥♥♥♥ing ppl over by not including Road to Boruto into Season Pass, but they pulled an ultimate nostalgia trump card.I wasn't expecting a good port or even HD textures or whatever. I also was pretty sure that the game is actually way worse than I remember (that's how nostalgy works). But I was actually surprised. The games are good. It does not require some fan-made patches, launchers, fixes to just get started and be able to choose correct resolution. It looks good, textures are actually HD. IT IS ACTUALLY IN 60 FPS! RIGHT FROM THE START! THATS RIGHT, YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT A YEAR AND A HALF FOR THEM TO IMPLEMENT IT. It will run like♥♥♥♥♥♥(sub 60 fps causing slow motion) if you turn on MSAA, like all other games in NUNS series. You still need to set your sound output device to potato quality of 44100HZ or you will get really disturbing sounds.The game itself feels good, even better than I remember. It really feels like Naruto game, not supersayan godlike brawler the last game is. I think that NUNS2 is the best in the series overall, but fighting in STORM 1 is just so good, substitution requires attention, not just button mash. Awakenings are true to the show, not just vague chakra aura around a character. Ultimates are closer to the anime.About the price. I wasn't sure that 9-year-old game is worth 12 bucks. It is, surprisingly. Go get it, it's worth it."

It has a lot of side-missions to do which accomany the main story missions. As of yet I have only played through the first story arc and have really enjoyed myself. The only complaints I have is the lack of characters in the free-battle at the start of the game (I'm sure I will eventually unlock more) and the fact that I feel i need to run around the hiddenlef villiage to collect scrolls after EVERY mission, after about 5 missions I decided to stop collecting these. Of course i will go back to collect them if i feel it is necessary.Overall I have really enjoyed playing this game thus far and look forward to eventually completing the game! :)If you have any questions feel free to ask in the comments below."

Only a few bad things about this game. No Zabuza arc, main mode doesn't focus arround the anime story as much as the other storm games, and on this port, you NEED to have a good graphics card and change your settings (which  I'm not going to explain here how) to always use your better graphics card.

,Recommended,495140,34980459,Posted: 15 September,all,Verdantil,Tags: Tournament CombatTLDR: Good game which can really be a must have for fans of the show. Finally we get to experience the story from where it begins which was lacking for this franchise on Steam. Felt nicely ported over to PC on my system.Xbox360 pad and resolutions working nicely. Very authentic to the TV show. You get a Mortal Kombat style mode and an adventure mode in which you have a main city hub and then you can go on instance based missions for either grind or to advance plot. The animations are fluid and slick. Voice acting was well done. The user interface makes sense and provides a nice variety of pertinent information. Nice minimap. Combat itself felt pretty awesome although it seems to have some twists to how it functions. Multiple difficulty modes for the combat.Game could had used a dedicated section to teach the ropes on how to implement combos and use the tag team mechanics. The camera was stubborn in wanting to default back to a behind the shoulder position which meant I was often re-adjusting it.

It's just a series of battles and minigames with short quips.So the cutscene thing that you see before buying may give off the COMPLETELY wrong impression.That aside the game looks great visually, but the english lip syncing is horrible. Don't look at their face when they talk or it will either bother/amuse you.Mechanically the game is fun, BUT there is a staggering issue with the AI.-Long story short, it's a bit fiddly and broken, but not in the sense of making the game easy. It's either a bit wussy, or beyond extreme with no gradient in between. With the Extreme AI being able to simultaneously use abilities, such as a block, a special power, and throwing shuriken, while dodging to the side. They can also use consumables while knocked down, and can simply ignore being struck by near any attack (Seemingly at random, even while recoiling from being struck) without any block animation. Even defense increasing items do not seem to mitigate losing nearly (80%-100%) an entire bar of health (1/3 of your total) from a single combo without being juggled. You can see it quickly getting frustrating and that retry button wearing out very quickly... Luckily so far the AI only seems to break on Side Missions with the exception of Orochimaru.Progression wise, there is an isn't much.-Progression feels... pretty weak, everything unlocked is more or less external to the main story or main mission mode. There is no way to make your character better or change their item loadout. Freeplay or at least the side missions allow you to select other unlocked characters, BUT they suffer from horribly from broken AI later one (About C rank or so) and you can't chance their loadouts either. So everything feels a little... dull. Especially if things are to change, you really aren't told much as to if you can or can't do something unless you pause the game and scroll through the list of your characters available powers and abilities. Some character on their time of use do not even have an ultimate ability, and your left to figure that out yourself.If you are looking for a good anime fighter, this isn't reccomended. The AI is far to sketchy to make any gameplay better than obnoxious. It could be a quirk of my pc that raises difficulty subtly to maximum silliness, but I'm not willing to bet on it.Also I saw there could be a whole host of bugs with the game that can cause it to no longer save, crash, run at weird frames... yeah you see where I'm going?

Compared to the later titles, it has some nice mechanics that were lost, but the game lacks content. Mainly, there isn't a story mode, only a free roaming mode with missions to complete. And some of them are the battles that happened in the anime. There's a few battles that have cutscenes, but the entire game should have them, because they were good. The minigames are OK, they aren't special but a nice bonus and they aren't overused. Free roaming is cool but the controls are clunky. Also, there's characters missing from the roster. But the core fighting mechanics are good, and that's the most important part. I was just disappointed with the lack of content, including an online mode. Lastly, i didn't had major issues with the PC port. But if you don't like Naruto, don't bother with this game."

I always wanted to play the first storm game but never did (even though I own a ps3, I could never find brand new copy anywhere). If you are a fan, I recommend trying this game out."
,Recommended,495140,34713261,Posted: 3 September,all,EdoNinjaStormHD,"In-Game Description: Highly recommend this game if you are into Hub world and do not mind doing certain missions to experience the story mode. Personally, the mini missions do not feel like a chore to me. The battle system is very nice and spectacular to perform jutsu clashes, punches, and Ultimate jutsus. You can feel the game was packed with a lot of love and care.Port Description: The port was nicely well done. The FPS is locked on stable and the quality is excellent. Overall mechanics feel faster and more fluid. Some items go out of place like paper bombs to where to supposed to be a direct hit to the opponent when that usually does not happen unless you are at a certain distance. It's not bad though but it is little things like that that makes it feel a little off."

Bought the game just for that...nah not really.Combat is actually...more the way the anime is. I mean it.. Substitution is harder to pull of, making combos more deadly and the use of items is more appropriate looking for openings.This is also the only Storm that has unblockables (with subsequent animation)I also like the way  Ultimates are executed. Both you and your opponent get a list of button commands. Whoever executes the most accurately wins.. This means Ultimates can be avoided!Just buy it..it wont disappoint you. Especially if you are a fan of the series"

If I'll rate this I'll give an 7.5/10       A pretty good game, you will like it more if you are a naruto fan."

,Recommended,495140,34895726,Posted: 11 September,all,GuyDing22,Edit: I figured out the issue I had before. For some reason the resolution settings don't work on my laptop and I had to manually enter them into the config.Now the game runs flawlessly. Aside from that minor bug the game is definitely worth a buy!
,Recommended,495140,35125449,Posted: 22 September,all,KenkoShaw,"They took out alot of the amazing features from this game in later games, the storymode isnt as good in this game as it is in later games however. The longer ninjutsu and Ultimate animations are really nice to watch and look alot better than the later  shortened versions. In this game you dont have the OP characters like madara and 10 different sasukes so i really like the more balanced feeling. There is however a game mechanic im glad they got rid of because it was really hard to pull off and seemed redundant, this was the ultimate impact which i didnt really like. This game has the best free roam out of all NUNS games and also it has achievable achievements which dont require you to S rank everything."
