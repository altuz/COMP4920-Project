76561198057142927,Recommended,495280,32704934,Posted: 23 June,all,ElectroVeeDub,"* Wanna play a game full of super sexy anime girls with tig ol' bitties?* Do you like stoned out penguins that obviously hit tha bong too much, and always call you ""Dood""?* How'd you like listening to abnoxiously hot snobby princesses b1t(hing at the main character, just like your wife does to you?* How'd you like to ENDLESSLY grind your chacters to level 1000 and beyond?* Are you tired of Bungies Destiny and trying to get the same damned legendary everybody else has too? Like Borderlands, no 2 legendaries are the same here...* Did you love Fire Emblem, Tactic's Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics/Advance?* Are you at least 30 years old and you know what the hell I'm talking about?Then welcome to Disgaea. It's a treasured console series from the PS2, PSP, PS3, and Vita days. The ""Master Race"" is indeed a very deprived race... this games over 10 years old and it just came out in 2017 on PC. WTF?Disgaea 2 PC is a strategy RPG, with countless hours of fun, grinding, hundreds of items, armor, weapons, and about ""200"" unit classes... supposedly. It's kinda like chess... after a few grams of mushrooms... for geeks.The combo's, spells, and basic attacks are all amazingly BRUTAL looking. When you see an anime girl throw a penguin up in the air and kick him in the sack, then she squeels in ecstasty... it's at that moment you'll realize this was the best money you ever spent.It runs on any potato, smart-phone, or laptop smooth as butter... and put away that keyboard and mouse Dood!! This game requires a controller to operate it at full speed and nostalgia. Although if the controller still baffles you after it's invention in the 1970's, you can use a KB/M. NIS did an upstanding job of giving Disgaea the HD treatment. It looks as good as can be expected in 1080p considering the games age.Don't expect top of the line graphics though! Those boobies are pixelated and you know you love it! The sprite animations are in a league of their own. The music sounds like it came from a PSP (and it did), but it's catchy and well done. The menu system is quick and inuitive. The RPG elements and statisics analyzing will melt your brain. The story is... who cares about the story? It's just a stupid fun game. You'll skip past the story anyways. But if you don't the story is a light hearted, humor based story of demons, overlords, criminals, and freeing the human race. Typical Japanese style weirdness. And the game is suitable for your kids too with no seriously objectionable content... provided your kids can handle the graphics. But hey... they play MineCraft, right?Long story short... if you're looking for your SRPG fix, and you missed Disgaea back on PS2 because you were tea-bagging bad kids in Halo 2, or dungeon crawling in Diablo 2... now's your chance. Strategy RPG's are a dying genre with only Disagea and Fire Emblem still active as franchises.That's the beautiful thing about Steam. It has a library of all the old games you wanted many years ago, but were too young and broke to afford. Console or PC games, doesn't matter, Steam has many of the gems. Now you're an adult and the games are mere dollars...Quit ripping yourself off and buy it. It's cheap. It's never too late. You got some catching up to do :)"

GOOGLE it and find out why, and learn about all the benefits you get to carry over to ADELL MODE< ( YES THERE ARE TWO MODES). You continue into ADELL MODE AFTER AXEL MODE.. Do not screw this Up and start Adell Mode First, or you will not have Magic Change,  Throw and Receive, and Many of the DLC /New Characters, NEW MONSTERS nor the AWESOME LEVEL GRINDING Spots IN AXEL MODE, until You beat ADELL MODE, thats like 20 Chapters and the Whole main Story with none of those options, Until you get into New Game + and then AXEL MODE will be much harder as well, I warned you. START IN AXEL MODE.First I suppose I should let you know I have every single Disgaea game available for consoles... Yes even the Original Disgaea 2 hour of Darkness. As in the original Released discs PS2 Discs.Second, this version is better than the PS2 version in every way. Heres WHY>Better Graphics (Character Filters, User Interface, Resolution that plays perfectly on a 4k TV, improved Character Portraits, and again Sharper Resolution for the cutscenes etc. )This is not simply a port. They have gone out of their way to make sure this is the best version of the game available. No Joke.It includes All the Extras from Dark Hero Days for the PSP, this changes everything. (More Characters, More Story, More Grinding, and leveling up areas, more Fights, More Cutscenes, and more AXEL..( He's really stupid but he grows on ya), MOAR Monsters, more Mechanics Like Stack Attacks, Throw and Recieve, and Magic Change 1 and 2. PLUS ALL THE DLC CHARACTERS FROM BOTH VERSIONS OF THE GAME, FREE.....:)In 2 weeks I have played 140 Hours... Does that tell you anything?Is it better Than Disagea 3, 4 , D2, or 5?  It has a way better story than 3 and D2 and 5, ( 4 is the best story of all of them) and it adds the Play mechanics from 3 which greatly increase it Play value and Fun factor.All I am going to say is if you have nerver played a Japanese SRPG (Strategy) then this one is a great starting point, it makes Disgaea 1 even the PC version almost unbearable to play... OMG Grinding in Disgea 1 was way way WAY slower.If you know what you are doing you can easily have a team of level 200+ Units and top end Gear in 25-35 hours.If you dont know what you are doing > GOOGLE, and save your self many mnay hours of wasted time... This is a researchers dream come true, read about strategies, tactics that other people used, Best methods for obtaining the Best Gear and massive Damage numbers, Secrets GALORE, and Character Leveling/Best Grinding techniques.Finally this is just an epic game, and you will never know the satisfaction of it unless you play it.. THE PC VERSION is FLAWLESS, and plays better smoother and faster than the PS2 in every way."
,Recommended,495280,30383946,Posted: 7 March,all,Fen,"People say Disgaea is grindy, but what does that actually mean?First off, I would say it's not grindy at all... if all you care about is beating the story (which is a good 30-40 hours of gameplay). The campaign is fun and well worth anyone's time. If you choose, you can overlevel your characters to have an easier time (it is really not necessary), but that can also suck the tension and fun out of the gameplay.If, however, you want to play the post game content (which is upwards of 100 hours of gameplay time), this is where you have to grind your♥♥♥♥♥off. Let me give you an example.The true final boss of the game essentially requires you to have several perfect items equipped. To get a perfect item, you need to collect bonus levels while leveling up an item. The ""mystery"" (aka RNG) portal that gives bonus levels CAN (but doesn't always) spawn every 3 floors. Even if the portal does spawn, it  LIKELY DOES NOT contain the bonus levels you need.What does this mean?It means that every 3 floors, you RESET THE GAME if you don't find your portal. If you find a portal, YOU RESET your game if it isn't one that gives bonus levels. To get a perfect item, you'll end up quitting and reloading the game upwards of 200 times. By the time you've beaten the true final boss of the game, you've reset thousands of times and there is simply *no way around that.*If you want to beat the post-game, you'll get really acquainted with this series of events: Menu, down down down down, quit game, yes, continue game, yes, talk to item worlder, enter item world, yes, check for portal, see that there in no portal, menu, down down down down, quit game, and repeat. You'll be doing that for hours. After a while your fingers hurt solely from resetting so much.Does that sound like fun?The true final boss of the game also requires you to have maxed out stats through leveling. Which means you'll be playing one map (Cave of Ordeals 4) over and over and over and over and over to level up, store somewhere between 6000-9999 levels, reincarnate to level 1, and do it again.Does that sound like fun?Just know what you're getting into. Personally, I don't mind leveling in the manner I just described. It's definitely not ideal, but you do get to watch your numbers go up, and in true ""role-play"" fashion, it does feel like your character is actually training.  I *DO*, however, mind being forced to reset the game so often in order to actually complete it. It's poor design. What happened is that people basically broke the ps2 version of the game by forcing perfect items through resets, and to compensate they released a boss that requires perfect items in the PSP version of the game. This version.Disgaea 1 did not require resets very often (just fringe cases of rarity matching and removing specialists). Having 100%'d both D1 and D2 here on steam, I can say that I enjoyed the post game a lot more in the first installment.I'm giving this game a lukewarm positive review because the story was fun the whole way through, and the post game has some decent content until you need to start perfecting stuff. I've read Disgaea 3 and upwards contain less of this ""reset hell,"" so here's hoping.7/10."

,Recommended,495280,29662087,Posted: 2 February,all,Cuhbrewin,"Remember, ""Your Mileage May Vary"" in regards to this port, but I believe that this time around performance is way better on launch than Disgaea PC was. Great job NISA!TL;DR: I wholeheartedly recommend Disgaea 2 PC for $20, especially if you've played Disgaea PC. (Buy it so we can get future Disgaea games on PC :D)------------------------Let's get introductions out of the way first, dood:Disgaea 2 PC is a port of the PSP remake of Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories, called Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days. (Lots of confusing names thrown around, I apologize! Basically: PS2 - Cursed Memories > PSP - Dark Hero Days > PC - Disgaea 2 PC) Disgaea 2 PC is much more of the gameplay from Disgaea PC, but improved.From my previous Disgaea PC review: (https://steamcommunity.com/id/cuhbrewin/recommended/405900/)#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorDisgaea (the series) is a tactical RPG (grid-based, turn-based, action points, the usual deal) with its key selling point being the ability to grind out your stats and level to absurd highs. The caps for stats and level are insanely high (~20 million for each stat in Disgaea PC and 9999 for level). There's a lot of bonus maps, content, and endings to access that the game acknowledges how many New Game Pluses you've done.... ...Another highlight of the Disgaea franchise is the Item World, a completely randomized dungeon crawl generated from items you collect in the game. By exploring the Item World, you can grab more items, grind out EXP, and improve that item's stats. Each item contains an expansive dungeon of 30, 60, or 100 floors, depending on the item's rarity.I'd like to add that Disgaea is perhaps a fully-aware series (in that it KNOWS it's a series of grinding SRPGs, and that the characters are well aware they are part of an entertainment medium), and I personally enjoy fourth-wall leaning/breaking in games. I'm a sucker for being super over-leveled for a stage so this series scratches my ""power fantasy itch"" well. Also, this series has some crazy over-the-top attack animations that just has to be experienced.Disgaea 2 remains mostly similar to Disgaea 1. So, instead of just analyzing this title on its own, I'm going to compare and contrast Disgaea 1 (PC) and Disgaea 2 (PC).CriteriaD1 ""Normal Review"" ScoreD1 ""Average = 5/10"" ScoreD2 ""Normal Review"" ScoreD2 ""Average = 5/10"" ScoreStory/Plot9/108/107/105/10Characters7/106/108/107/10Music8/106/1010/109/10Graphics/Art Style5/104/105/104/10Mechanics8/107/109/108/10Value10/1010/1010/1010/10Performance8/107/109/109/10Going off this table, you can see I slightly lean towards Disgaea 2 for music and characters, but Disgaea 1 for a story. On their own, I like most of the D2 characters -- heck even Taro and Hanako I don't mind too much -- except for maybe Yukimaru, zam. ...GOD THAT ""ZAM"" IS ANNO-- *clears throat* I'm joking about not liking Yukimaru :). Anyway... the plot of Disgaea 2 that the characters are placed in is... well, I can't really express it other than ""it's just a pretty good story"". Whereas D1 has an excellent story(in that Laharl finds and accepts love; trust me, play D1 it's better than it sounds), but most of the characters are all bonkers, if not a little annoying (whether on purpose or otherwise idk; in Disgaea D2 they're much more enjoyable imo). Basically what I'm getting at is D1 has genre-savvy characters in an overall excellent RPG plot and D2 has cliche characters in a rather mediocre RPG plot. Take your pick.I should probably also say that there's a lot more to do in Disgaea 2, but the added mechanics of Magichange (monster polymorphing into a weapon), ""Toss & Pass"" (monster ""tossing""), Innocent Towns, Mystery Rooms, and the Land of Carnage just adds on to the amount of things to learn (which is already quite mind-numbing for a newbie before these additions). Overall, the game feels slightly faster and smoother, but not as fast or smooth as I would want it to be. Take that statement however you will.I don't use one, butI think that a gamepad is preferable for Disgaea. If you don't own one you'll have to fiddle with key binds, like I did. Or, you can try using the Mouse (I don't use Mouse but I hear it's a bit fiddly, just like Disgaea PC) EDIT: I used an Xbox 360 Controller and I can confirm the gamepad support is solid, if maybe a little unstable (the game crashed when my controller lost connection to the wireless receiver).With regards to Graphics, neither port/re-make has improved much on/moved beyond the PS2-era graphics (you can only do so much to them). So if you're in the market for a graphically-pleasant SRPG, don't try this one. In terms of music, I didn't think Disgaea 1's soundtrack was bad, but Disgaea 2 has a better OST than D1 in my opinion.Overall, a better buy than Disgaea PC if you already own that one. Plus, you get an ownership discount for buying Disgaea 2 PC if you own Disgaea PC! Otherwise, if you don't own D1 PC, I'd say try the demo first before getting D1 or D2."

,Recommended,495280,29600514,Posted: 30 January,all,hockeyhacker97,"A fairly well done port of a 13 year old PS2 game that was great at the time and still holds up today. If you don't know what the Disgaea series is, think of it like a pun on the Fire Emblem/Final Fantasy Tatics genre where it takes the genre and intensionally over emphisizes everything about the genre, and while its story is much weaker then Fire Emblem, mechanicly its a lot better then FE.  The series had a lot of advanced mechanics in the game specially for the time that are still enjoyable today, they haven't aged at all.Only reason I would not recomend this game would have been if the port was shody, but it's not, it runs smooth, controls well, only real flaw I have with the game is that some (not all but some) cutsceens are unskipable, which isn't an issue for a first playthrough, but still there shouldn't be unskipable cutscenes in games unless they are purely to be used to mask load times."

,Recommended,495280,29714060,Posted: 5 February,all,Yal,"To summarize, Disgaea 2 PC does everything the PC port of the first game did, but much better. Apart from including DLCs from all the previous versions of the game - for free, nonetheless - all systems are refined, giving you more combat options and less grinding.- Every character has a passive ability that gives them something unique, giving you a reason to not just roll with the characters with the best base stats.-There's special equipment that raises weapon aptitude to S and stat aptitudes to over 100% for each weapon type, making your dreams about gun-toting healers and swordfighting witches a lot more viable! (if you can spare an equipment slot)-There's a lot more cute monsters this time around! 0w0- The item world has random Mystery Rooms every few floors and you can cause Dark Courts to appear at certain floors, breaking up the monotony of levelling up items with some bonus rewards, shopping, or minibosses. You even sometimes get a chance to buy Rare and Legendary items, which means you don't need to spend ages looking for a Legendary Cosmic Blade!-The story is made out of several parallel narratives, which leads to an overall smoother pacing.- There is no damage from ending a turn lifting an ally, and a stack of characters can do special combo attacks, making the lift/throw system more useful than just quickly moving around.- There are magical monster weapons now making caster monsters more viable in combat.-The Demon Rank system is removed, anyone can apply for any Dark Assembly bill... no more need to grind Promotion Exams whenever you want to do something!And to all of the above, add more secret bosses than ever before and no less than TWO alternate overworlds to unlock (the Dark World and the Land of Carnage) that each adds new challenge to the basic story missions, and you easily have enough content to spend hundreds of hours playing."

Second Verse, even better than the First!TL;DR at the end.Disgaea 1 was a fantastic game, truly unique and original, with an okay storyline, great humor and fantastic, if grind-heavy, SRPG gameplay. Disgaea 2, in my opinion, is everything great about D1, only even better. D2 streamlines the gameplay, adds to the character roster, and has an upbeat, halloween/carnival-esque atmosphere.Where D2 truly shines, however, is in the story and characters. In D1, while I loved Laharl, Etna, Flonne and the gang, the story was moving and poignant only up until the Red Moon Arc... then I felt the writers stopped trying. D1 took the silliness too far, and in the later third the story descended into flat jokes, monotony and bad characters (The entire Gordon and Earth arcs are garbage, and the final act is meh). The game was a parody of sorts, but it was rarely laugh out loud funny, so when the plot lapsed and the humor continued, it all collapsed. D2 however, places the humor where it belongs; peppered throughout, but not the main point (with the exception of Axel Mode, but I barely consider that part of the game). With plenty of humor and funny moments, the main story is compelling and the characters are moving and well written, and that puts this game in the upper echelon of RPGs in my book.TL;DR: Recommended for its great use of humor and characters, superior story to the first game, and polished gameplay. Worth it even at full price."

The time you spend in this game is always rewarded, and you will never feel like you are ""wasting"" time. Each challenge in the game (normal + post game) requires you to farm just a little bit more to achieve your next objective. Other than grinding itself, the general mechanics of the game are very well done, starting from the character creation to the combat system. I loved every aspect of this game, most likely my favorite game of all time.Absolutely a mustbuy for RPG lovers.Virtually infinite, you could just spam item world forever and you will always have something new to do.Don't buy it if you want a super deep story, as you will find a retard flying frog, a evil principal getting turned on by your super strenght, a retard overlord kid, and Axel the dark Hero, the most retard character i have ever seen (and his little Brother, axident).Buy it if you want to get turned on by your super strenght after 6 hours of farming.Jokes aside, the only real negative thing about the game is (except ambling pirates) that you must follow lots of guides to fully understand the game in all its mechanics, as some of them are really complex when you face them for the first time.Well negative for some, at least. I even made excel files to study all that♥♥♥♥♥♥and it had been great.Waiting ansiamente for Disgaea 3, because the guy who gets turned on is probably my favorite character.Axident is the best name for a kid, i know i know."

I'll keep adding to this review as I progress in the game.40-hour update: I've had a blast with Disgaea 2. I've binged the crap out of this game and enjoyed every single minute. The turn-based combat is tons of fun, and it's very satisfying to level up your characters, learn new skills, explore the random dungeons, etc. Hands down one of my favorite turn-based tactics games so far (and that's saying something because that's my favorite genre). Amazing depth."
,Recommended,495280,33156303,Posted: 2 July,all,Rayko,"Well there, after I saw all the endings I guess it's time to write a review. I recommend this game to people who enjoyed the first Disgaea, Final Fantasy Tactics or any kind of grindy turn-based RPG. The game is a little bit too grindy for my taste, but later games in series make the process more enjoyable (they are yet to be ported though...).In comparison with the first part of Disgaea series, it looks pretty solid.Gameplay contains much more features than the first one, which, however, are yet to be polished (in the next games that slowly make their way to PC users). Usage of monsters in your squad is more interesting than before (a pity that the brand-new mechanic starts working only after your first playthrough...)and special abilities make classes truly unique. New specialists are good and amount of skills is great.However, the gameplay contains some annoying features like (completely luck-based) farming for Treasure Maps to unlock an area with better stuff and, well, basically endgame content. Another one is 'Felony' system, which represent an interesting mechanic and has some entertaining cutscenes, but requires a little but too much effort to provide valuable results (also required to be used to have bad endings).Plot-wise the game seems slightly inferior to the first game. The plot still contains a nice range of emotions (upbeat/cute/sad), but the scale is more shallow. In my opinion, it references (okay, simply uses) Etna and Laharl, a little bit too agressivly. The main rival, Axel, is rediculed way more than Mid-Boss/Vyers was in the first game and he fails to provide a nice impression, unlike Vyers, even though being mentioned for longer periods time - they needed 'Dark Hero Days' expansion, which allows us to play a story of Axel, to truly show us what a person he is. Endings are abundant, but only the main ending feels complete, while others leave an impression of being cut just after the culmination. The worst ending cuts back and provides some nightmare fuel, something that children of sin deserve <3Music is still great. That's it, I highly recommend to listen to some heartwarming, cool, encouraging tracks: Cyber Dance, White Tiger, Sparkling (main ending ost), ETONA Rock, some others.To be honest, I am not a perfectionist/completionist, I don't have enough love for grinding. It slightly spoils the endgame content for me since you just have to earn these sweet 9999 levels, Yosh*tsunas and so on, but I will probably try to complete this one."

,Recommended,495280,29749442,Posted: 6 February,all,Dekonega,Hell must have frozen over because we have a Nippon Ichi Software title from their probably best known game series Disgaea on GNU/Linux (Tested on Fedora Workstation 25). It runs well and has no obvious technical issues (or at least I haven't encountered any).It has a good mouse and keyboard support with UI that shows keyboard keys. Not all keyboard keys are in logical places but this set-up is functional. You can also play keyboard only if that is your thing.I've not experienced any sound issues yet. The game has Japanese audio which you can enable from the settings. Music in this game is pretty good.I'm giving this game a bit of slack on graphics front since it's so old and runs in-general so well. You can turn off the 2D sprite filters that make the game's fine pixel art look bad. The new higher resolution fonts and other UI improvements look nice even if they don't perfectly sit into place.I'll update the review if I'll see something worth mentioning.
,Recommended,495280,30595813,Posted: 18 March,all,Bearsuo Sr.,"I am so very, very glad that Disgaea was ported to the PC.Super short - if you miss a good SRPG like Final Fantasy Tactics, this is in the same neighborhood. It's a slighlty different game, but nothing has scratched that itch like this, since - to include FFT-A (!).This game is amazing, if you're at all a fan of gearing up, tweaking, and grinding in an RPG. It doesn't have the perpetual ""oh no, didn't get lucky for that 1 in 1,000,000 roll"" of the ARPG Diablo style games, and it doesn't have a ""you must grind 1,000 levels over years"" of a KRPG. With any RPG sensibilities, you most likely can clear the main game without ever grinding - natural leveling should cover things. If you *want* to keep going, you can - there are layers upon layers of additional challenges you can further advance your characters through, with commeasurate ""hidden"", ""side"" or ""post-game"" bosses/challenges to match up your advancement with.Some don't like the story, and it isn't exactly going to win any awards, but I thought it was fine enough - and better than most JRPG stories (no fate of the world hanging in the balance, but still serious movers and shakers).Love, love, love. And, the best part is... it looks like I can keep playing until I feel done. Awesome. Definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and if you're a completionist... better set aside the next year of your life.And how many RPGs dare you to break ""the rules"" of the game? ""Ah, I'm going to lift my characters and throw them over here and extend their movement and get bonus points on this or that..."""

For some reason or another this franchise has completely eluded me so far, and I'm glad I found it.When I first heard ""tactical RPG"", I was a bit confused what that even means. It's an RPG based on turn-based combat, kinda in the vein of Advance Wars and similar. It's really engaging and fun on the game mechanics side.Also, the presentation side is immensely cute and humorous. The English voices are, well, not quite up to par... this game was localized back when voice acting for video games in the West was considered a novelty at best. But switching over to the Japanese voice fixes that, they did put in the needed talent.I do wish they spent more energy on bugfixing the port though, particularly on OSX. Both the controller and the keyboard has issues."

A lot of fun stats that can literally be upgraded infinitely. Check. Grinding that is fun and is always accomplishing upgrades. Check. Hidden side quests. Check. Multiple endings. Check. Making the ultimate hero that can cause 9 trillion damage in one hit. Check.This game gets addicting if you are into RPGs that offer a lot of stat customization. Grinding may get a little repetitive but theres always something new to do to make your heroes stronger. The story is good, not great but good enough to keep you engaged and can be pretty funny.I consider this one of the best grinding games ever and even go as far to say that it is on par with Diablo. This isnt a game for everyone, especially if your looking for a Elder Scrolls or Fallout type of RPG but if you like turn based RPGs like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger you might enjoy this game.I hightly recommend this game to anyone intrested in grinding away to level 9999 and then use reincarnate to drop back to level 1 (by doing this gains permanent stat boosters) just to grind back to level 9999 just to reincarnate again.

Luckily (or as it should have been expected) I haven't found any so far, even though there's still lots of attacks and maps to play. Just so you know, I have a 960.So, for those who have played the previous game, this one has obviously a different story but the gameplays share lots of features, it's Disgaea after all. For example, pistols still have a huge range of attack, but you can't attack enemies that are in diagonal. Still, easy to get used to. Funny, sometimes absurd just like Disgaea.Only bad thing I've found: with the new UI, the pictures in high definition are just... Meh, I don't really like them, the lines look weird. It looks like it hasn't been made by a person. Personal opinion. Fortunately, you can use the old UI and they look as they were in the original game (I suppose).Overall, a great game as I expected, with tons of content.

Get any RPG made by Nippon Ichi you will not be disapointed.Do you need to play the first game to understand this one...well no technicly you don't have to, but you should play the first one before this 1, not because you need to know the plot of the first game as this game while in the same universe and taking place after, you don't need to know what happened in the previous game to understand whats going on, the reason you want to play the first game is that this one takes the first's mechanics and just improves them in every way, so going back to the first one is a lot harder then going forward.The plot is great, the characters are memorable (I LOVE YOU DARK HERO AXEL!) and the music, oh god the music, my favorite is Sinful Rose, which you can see in the awesome anime opening.For 20 dollars you get a game that will last you a long time with its multiple endings and new game plus mode, all the DLC fights from the previous versions here, Axel mode, see the Former Dark Hero and how he got into this game, and of course the insane power levels, I kid you not the level cap is 9999, no I did not add another 9 by mistake, Nippon Ichi is infamous for the high power level, and given you can reincarnate a character at anytime to reset them to 1 with a huge buff, the skies the limits in this one.You won't be disapointed in this game ,I know I don't regret buying this and I'm hoping for more of the Nippon Ichi library put up here on SteamThis game gets a rating of 5 Exploding Prinies out of 5, Totally Awesome."

,Recommended,495280,29620900,Posted: 31 January,all,Ktroys,"So, After the port of the first game, NISA has gone on to port the 2nd game. While this port does not have the performance issues the first did (so far), there aren't that many visual enhancements to the game. The game looks mostly the same as it did on the PS2/PSP, save for higher render resolution and the UI.So a bit of some history: the PSP version was a mess. the DLC characters in that game had messed up sound effects, a few of their skills healed when they looked like they should damage, they were level 100 characters that you could get right at the begining, and 3 didn't even make it outside of Japan. All those issues are fixed, though only Almaz and Sapphire have english VOs. Also, they start at level 2,Buuut, they forgot to change their map bonuses, so you'll still be getting a few mid rank items early.That's about it for the major differences. This game is a LOT easier to play than the 1st due to the ability to skip cutscenes, speed up dialoge, actions, and movement, and even skip attack animations on you or your enemies' turn. The usual Disgaea extras are there in full force: Alternate Endings, a side story, LOTS of cameo bosses, Item world, Dark World,  Land of Carnage, Cave ofgrindingOrdeals, and of course, everyone's favorite NISverse Extra Boss, Baal.If you want a time sink, then Christmas has come early, on the back of a Prinny God with 3 Accelerators."
,Recommended,495280,29623369,Posted: 1 February,all,DigitalBasic,"This is my favorite Disgaea title. It takes the core mechanics of the first Disgaea and improves them in many ways, as well as contains the content from the PSP version (which includes Axel's story, Disgaea 3 characters, the Magichange system from 3, recuitable side characters that weren't in the PS2 version, and all the PSP DLC characters actually working right). If you want to experience it for the first time I'd pass on unlocking the DLC characters until you complete the story one time, as the Map Bonuses for the DLC characters contain mid-game items that completely trivialize the entire first playthough. However, if you want to start your grinding early, the map bonuses are good for getting started right away.It is a smooth port. NIS learned their lesson with the initial release of Disgaea PC and has had betas for their games before launch, and it shows. Haven't had any issues with framerate or bugs of any kind. There aren't many PC-exclusive options but at the same time there really isn't much that needs to be changed. The character filter is alright if you fancy that sort of thing, and the two UI options are very good. Plus, Disgaea 2 had the option to change movement speeds in battle, something that definitely turned me away from the first Disgaea.If you liked the first game, pick this up. If you are a fan of strategy RPGs like Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics, still pick this up. I recommend this one over the first just for the quality of life changes. You don't need to know the story of Disgaea 1 to enjoy this outside of a few returning characters."

Fortunatelly this version has some improvements since Dark Hero Days in some ways.The story is nothing new but is pretty decent; difficulty wise the main story is very easy if you go offtrack and go to the Item World, which can happen a lot if you like to be overlevel. The postgame is very grindy, but fortunately less tedious in some ways from most of the usual RPGs since the levels are randomly generated.Pros:+ Improved UI. The item's icons and menus looks pretty good.+ No need to buy the DLCs since the game automaticaly gives you the events to unlock the DLC characters. This is the only reason why I won't say the game is overpriced (even more I got it in a sale).+It's a strategy RPG. If you love to grind, craft you perfect items and characters this game is for you.+ The grinding is less tedious since Item World generates all the levels. You can get some pretty and nasty surprises from enemies holding that item that you want and Pirates ambushing you!+The OST is awesome AND you can change it for Item World anytime. Even the DLC's characters got their songs added to the PC version.+Aside from the real final superboss, you can beat most of the endgame stuff with almost every character. It's good  since you're not forced to abuse Magic Knight / Lahalh / etc to beat most of postgame bosses. But the same can't be said from the final superboss (if they kept his difficulty as the PSP version)Cons- The grinding has a LOT of resets in the Item World for you to pray for RNG to give you Good/Great Luck on the Mistery Gate (only applies for perfecting Items for the fina superboss). I had Mao showing up 4 times without an Old Man appearing on the Mistery Gate one afternoon! Also grinding Lovers and Felonies can consume a long time.- The game is 99% a port. I would love to see the same game with HD characters.- Dark Eclair's portrait looks awful AND I didn't unlock her OST in the Item World even after obtaining her and buying songs from the Item World's Succubus. Maybe you need to get all the DLC characters and the devs screwed up on the unlocking musics for the IW?If you like SRPGs and grinding, this game is for you. If you don't like to grind, stay away from this game unless you only want to do the main game.

There is no need to play the first game to really enjoy this one, but it would be better if you did play the first game(some characters from the first game make reappearance), which is also great.Tl;dr It's great, If you liked the first Disgaea or JRPG/SRPG/TRPG, it's well worth it.Bring the other Disgaea to PC too please!EDIT: Commas and stuffs."

,Recommended,495280,29608094,Posted: 31 January,all,Admiral McBoat,"A great game, as always. The lettering, interface, character portraits, and backgrounds have all been redone to look nice and crisp on modern displays. The same can't be said for the textures and various sprites, however, which really date the game. It would have been trivial, in many cases, to lift character sprites from the newer Disgaea games. Maybe someone will put out a patch (official or otherwise) that will address that.For those who are going backward to experience an older title in the series for the first time, fair warning: Many of the quality-of-life features from, say, Disgaea 5 aren't present. It's mostly little things, like immediate access to certain information and visual cues, or the ability to reposition your characters without having to completely reset their movement. Other features, like hot-swapping weapons on the fly, were never part of the original game and shouldn't be expected in the PC version. On the other hand, all this is generally improved over the original Disgaea, so there's that.Mouse control is a little wonky, but functional. You're probably still going to want to play this with a controller, or at least with a combination of keyboard and mouse.Even without the benefit of nostalgia, I'd recommend this to SRPG fans as a solid title with plenty of tactical variation and innovation."

You'll probably spend most of your time on item world than the main map.NoteIf you've never played Disgaea series before, I suggest you to play D1 (Disgaea 1) first instead. Yes you can skip the first one but playing the second one and then the first one is not the pleasant experience (gameplay wise) since D2 has a lot more added mechanic than D1.Either way, I recommend D2 more than D1 since it's better honestly."

The item world is expansive, the dark sun missions are brutal, and to top it off post-game is enormous, including Axel's side story which allows you to use magi-change that changes your monster based demons into weapons.The game comes with a New-game+ feature as well.Get it, get it, get it you won't find a better game for 20$"

The ""heroes"" of the first game make cameos within, though only one of them sticks around for long. You play as Adell. The story itself starts with your cursed mother deciding to try and summon the Overlord of this Netherworld to your location so you can defeat him... As plans goes this is rather stupid, as summoning anything titled ""Overlord"" is likely to be beyond most people's ability to fight...Luckilly (or not), the summon goes awry and his daughter is the one who is summoned. And by terms of the summoning, bound to you... you know this sounds like a potential trope unfolding... I wonder if you'll fall in love (not sure if demons understand love... but the Seduce Me otomes follow that concept, too, so...).Anyway, there is a lot of funny moments. The snark level is high. Gameplay is as easy as before, and the plot engaging. Many of the mechanics of the previous volume return, slightly tweaked for more optimal usage."

Vastly improved upon disgaea series and adds a bunch of content to the game. the remake follows some nice additions from Disgaea 3 like the magicchange for monsters. the remakes of each game so far has fix and basically improved the game across the board in terms of features.I've spent 2000 hours on the original game alone and spent many hours on the psp version. of course I've never fully finished post game as there is so much that can be done in this game.So far I have not ran into any sort of problems with the pc port and it seems from what I've heard from how bad the disgaea 1 pc port was, disgaea 2 pc makes it pretty pc friendly. while it will be easy to tell if you like the game in the first few hours either you'll love it or hate it this series knows what it is doing.if you want to get into the disgaea series I'd say start with the first one but the first one did not age well while i enjoyed it I knew what i was getting into with disgaea 1, but disgaea 2 is probably the best start into the Disgaea series as a lot of disgaea 2 freatures like pirates and LoC and most post game content makes returns in later games of the series.this game runs pretty well in the background as well so for those who like to mutigame then this is a must, as you can go thru the item world while Raiding in ffxiv or any other game with a que while you wait."

I have never played Final Fantasy or any of it's titles; just Tactics.  I love the way the combat works.  I've always wanted a game that incorporated that type of combat on a non-console; and haven't really been able to do one myself.Hadn't found one, and this looked similar enough - and now that I've played it -Ok let's just get the part out of the way where the Prinny characters say 'DOOD' (pronounced dude) all the time.  Yes, like I do.  Moreso, but well - just like when I speak ""dude"" (a dialect of US English.)  That alone makes me love the game.There's a part of the tactics where you can 'lift' (pick up) a character adjascent to you and _throw_ them.  That means you can move further in one turn.  Which is great for extending your attack range.  And you can toss to another character, who can then toss... so you can move very quickly across the battle.  And then you can pick up someone picking someone else up, which... yeah there's a great deal you can do with that tactic.  (Also the prinnies explode when you toss them.  Which is somewhat a problem as they are then dead, but... it's a tactic.)I haven't quite mastered the combo attack yet (where a character next to another character will combine for a bigger attack) or figured out some of the special attacks, but - yeah.  This is as good, if not better, than Final Fantasy Tactics.Yes, it's a PSP port (thanks Shiki Ryougi), but I don't care - the game is great and I hadn't been familiar with it before.  I am hoping the first in the series, and eventually everything up to and including the 5th version (coming for the Nintendo switch) is available, because this is excellent.I understand it is very grindy, and I'm likely to be playing this for the rest of my life, as I haven't finished the GBA FFT yet and I've been playing that on/off for 10+ or so years.So - if you like Final Fantasy Tactics - you'll likely love this game; very similar, but with it's own extensions to the combat."

,Not Recommended,495280,34204320,Posted: 12 August,all,Asmo6035,"I've been a gamer for a long time, having gotten my start playing all of the snes classic RPGs, so when I saw this game and its particular style, I brought it immediately. Being the type of player that enjoyed Lufia 2's ancient dungeon, and Star Ocean 2's Bonus dungeon's, I thought that I would really enjoy some of Disgaea's game mechanics -- in particular randomly generated item worlds, and the ability to level your characters well beyond the typical 99 cap (the cap in this game is literally 199000 levels....yes, you read that right).Unfortunately, This is the most unnecessarily complicated game I have ever played in my life. There is simply too much going on to make it enjoyable. The game plays more like a single player MMO in terms of sheer grindiness, none of which is remotely necessary to complete the storyline.Pros:Fun storyline and reasonable plotGreat voice acting (main character sounds like Goku)Good music and graphics for the genreCons:This game has everything and the kitchen sink thrown into it, and yet there isn't even that much variety.You can create as many characters as you want over a broad range of your typical RPG classes (thieves, knights, mages, etc). Each of those classes has multiple tiers that are unlockable through leveling. Each of those characters can be leveled to 199000, by repeatedly going to level 9999 and reincarnating back to level 1 again. Additionally, all characters can train in any of the 5 types of equipment (swords, bows etc), and gain skill levels (up to 255) that unlock new abilities. Those abilities can then be leveled up to 99 each.If all of the above wasn't enough, you will also level every single item in the game, from your lowly potions to your high level gear. In order to do that, you have to enter into the ""item world"" which is basically a RNG created world for that specific item. Items come in common (30 floors), rare (60 floors), and legendary (100 floors) qualities. Every 10 floors you have the chance to leave the dungeon. Every 30 floors there is a boss character. Each floor you complete adds a level to the item...though the max level for a legendary is actually 200, which you can get to by burning even more time in item world by going into ""mystery gates"" which are random encounters.And if all that wasn't bad enough, items also have ""specialists"", which are 20 different types of souls that can by slotted into an item to provide additional benefits like raising stats. Sound easy? Nope. You have to level those too....up to level 20000 for a stat related soul. Oh and those souls have to be ""subdued"" so they can be transferred to other items....a process that consists of killing them in the item world.But wait! That's not all! In addition to the normal slog of killing things and leveling, most maps have what's known as ""Geo Panels"", which come with their own sets of effects. For instance, you could stand on a 20% damage panel and lose 20% of your health per turn. Now that doesn't sound so bad, except that you're going to be completing thousands of these floors, and you can't even autopilot. Even when your character is 1000x more powerful than the enemies you're encountering, you still have to pay attention, or else you might find yourself dead regardless.This whole game is a tireless, neverending slog which is almost entirely devoid of purpose. It's almost as if it was created solely to laugh at completionists/perfectionist players that want to maximise their gaming experience. Anyone who actually does it, after the thousands of hours it would take to achieve, has absolutely no life."

The graphics with the high res menus and low res world really freak me out, it's like your eyes don't work properly cause the world is so blurry (played it on a 60"" screen though, maybe it's okay on a small screen).Also got stuck at the border of the first map immediately and had to reload.In the end I got a refund... It looks like it might be fun though, if the graphics wouldn't be so crappy."

It takes the gameplay elements and formula that made the first entry so engaging to play and improved upon them by adding new units and mechanics making the already intricate gameplay of the first even more engaging.The cast this time around focuses on a duo of characters rather than the lovable trio of the first (though they do make cameo appearances) and while the narrative isn't as good as the first, it still retains the same amount of charm and humor that the series has become renowned for."

The story for me is very funny, it has a certain humor to it, like the characters know they're in a game. The grinding is really fun when you can learn to clear a map in under a minute, that for me is something I'd like to improve to getting 1 hit clears. This is basically my first disgaea, I played Disgaea 1 for an hour a while ago and found out that Disgaea 2 would probably be a better option.After watching loads of videos on YouTube about the game, I bit the bullet and bought it. Probably one of my best gaming purchases of all time, as it's got me into the franchise now I think.You should buy this game even if it's at full price, it really isn't that expensive for the hours and hours of gameplay you'll get out of it."

Everything seems to have been fixed in the transition phase, the images are sharper, the original DLC from the PSP port is automatically included, and game seems to run even better than the original, rather than annoying screen tearing that won't go away no matter how much you tinker with it getting in the way.Also, this was actually my favorite Disgaea entry in the entire series, with my favorite characters, Adell and Rozalin. Just playing this game again is such a treat, as I get to experience their romance bloom all over again after not being able to play this game for almost 10 years now. I really like this series, but I REALLY like this game in particular. I would actually recommend playing this port over Disgaea 1 for the PC if you want to find an entry into the series."

If you like games like Fire Emblem, where it's square-by-square, you'd probably really like Disgaea. Honestly, I think it's an underrated series, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Hoping they put the rest of them up, too. I'll definitely buy them. This, actually, is my favorite game of the whole series, though I really enjoyed D2 as well. The only complaint I really have is that you can't change the jump button. Really wish I could make it space, but 'L' works, too, I guess. Anyways, yeah. Square-by-square anime JRPG with cute pixel graphics, quirky characters, and a pretty neat story with a heck of a twist. Nice."

I would love to see more PS2 ports hit steam, and can't wait for awesome games like Disgaea 4: APR (great damn game) to hit steam. Disgaea 1 PC had a few issues at lauch, but it looks as if they've learned their lesson and optimized this game well. Get it.Also, a message to Nippon Ichi. Do NOT rush your ports. Take as long as you want. As proven with D1PC and D2PC, these are the definitive versions of both games. I'm sure all PC gamers would rather wait and have the best versions of the entire franchise."

Expansive class selection. Fully customizable characters, which there are a boatload of. Ton of replay value with new game plus and item world, which is an almost never ending series of randomly generated dungeons. Love this game.HOWEVER, the end game is a bit ridiculous. Perfecting items is a mind-numbing affair taking anywhere from 10-20 hours to perfect just ONE item. You need at least four perfected items to beat the last boss of the post game, so its basically required for you to spend 50 hours resetting your game so you can have ultimate gear. Not a great design choice and seriously limits my willingness to play this game at times. While this does add playtime, it is mind-numbing and repetitive; so unless you just want to beat the story modes, prepare for a LONG grind.Great game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gear perfection keeps this from getting a 10/10.

But if the gameplay is interesting, you will want to play over and over.When you finish the (main) campaign, thats barelly the start of really playing a Disgaea game. Each game on the series is build from the ground up for multiple New Game + replays using the same save file. This is thanks to a large roster of characters, varied weapons and multiple complex subsystems.Now if you do know about Disgaea and SRPGs, all i have to say is that 2 is maybe the best of the Disgaea series."
