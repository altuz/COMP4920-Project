76561198006413390,Recommended,495350,25775902,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,woosk,"This second title from the Woodle Tree series feature an identical Woodle Tree and Woodle Beaver again with additional new companions Woodle Fox and Woodle Bush. Game is now open world rather than a set of defined levels and Woodle Tree is tasked with exploring all 8 different regions around his home, collecting berries to buy and unlock additional items, finding all the water of life drops needed to restore life to Woodle Father and the grove of trees surrounding him and to bring an end to the Dark Sage Tree's corruption and drying up of the land. Game remains very colourful and cute, Woodle Tree now has the ability to perform double jumps, hang glide, activate door and elevator panels and collect water from waterfalls to give to small plant shoots to make it grow instantly and provide elevation for Woodle Tree and his companions to reach higher areas. There are also some new unfriendly creatures that are large and immune to Woodle Tree's leaf swing attack, although Woodle Tree and his companions remain nimble enough to be able to easily run and jump past and outrun any pursuing creature.Among the cons, the camera sometimes panning for no reason which can confuse the player and cause Woodle Tree to fall off a ledge sometimes, slightly long loading time when entering any different region for the first time and Woodle Tree being skied just for riding a wooden elevator occasionally also for no reason (I didn't know mechanical wooden elevators have turbolift capabilities, its usually not a major problem although I have had a few instances where Woodle Tree was being skied infinitely up above the clouds with no way to get back down. xD) Currently, there is also no obvious reward for playing the game with local co-op or in MMO mode. It would be nice if the online MMO mode would allow character selection as a different character and further unlockable characters if that is possible.The game remains forgiving, with decent save checkpoints at each major section along all regions with most platform jumps or enemy areas easy to navigate across. Collecting 10000 berries needed to unlock an achievement and purchase the most expensive item will take considerably longer than in the first Woodle Tree. At the time of this review, it will take approximately 10-20 hours to find all the water of life drops, win over the Dark Sage Tree and collect all 10000 berries needed for all achievements in this game."

It was divided into worlds that were easy enough to access and explore. I finished the game in hopes there would be more.Come to today, we have Woodle Tree 2 : Worlds.Woodle Tree 2 is everything Woodle Tree isn't and more.  This game is not only incomplete, it's not even stable.  There is a vast world out there with lots to explore, but it's a cluttered mess of colors and designs, that you really don't know where you are a lot of the time. Something like this could of used a mini map, but instead it leaves you trying to find 3 Water Drops per world in what I saw to be quite an empty design.  I see so much area just empty, and you're able to explore it too.Controls took a downgrade in this edition, as at times they don't work with jumping, or double jumping. Sometimes attacks won't respond, and sometimes for no reason at all, the game will freak out and put me into a turbo speed walk that I would need to jump in the air just to stop.Sounds are pretty bleak, but the last game kind of suffered that issue too, so nothing changed there.Music is....sadly feeling missing at times. The first game had an enjoyable soundtrack that was peaceful to listen to. This game, seems to either be no music, or the music is so low that you don't even know it's playing unless you really try to listen.Story is painful. You are tossed in this vast world, and you need to stop whatever evil came into town and you're own your  own from there. I can't talk to anything or anyone, but they see me and like to watch me walk around, so it's pointless to bother figuring it out. The game just wants you to go out and figure it out I guess.Game is colorful, and retains that feeling, but it's sadly so mixed up in colors and designs that it's not even pretty or enjoyable to look at.Overall, Woodle Tree 2 : Worlds is rushed mess. A series that I would of hoped to be something more, seems to of taken a road to rushing to get something on the market fast. This game could of been something so much more had it had the time, and was developed more.   Unlike the first title which I recommended and enjoyed, I can't recommend this one. It's empty, it's depressing to play, and it's missing all potential in a good action platformer. I should also add, the load times are very painful to get through.  Areas load and it could take up to a minute. The game loading alone to just start is almost 2 minutes.Try again Chubby Pixel5/10"

I enjoyed this game and will probably watch for the devs next game, because mechanically it feels like a better version of those old ps2 games i liked. I like the sprint button, the colorful art style, the open world nature, but the game has issues. The story is told through pictures and i had no idea what was happening, i can't tell enemies apart from friends, i don't have camera options for inverted controls, and i dislike running long stretches of land with nothing in them.Mechanically theres something to be had, but I spent my entire playtime running around a giant empty world with nothing to do. The game needs to be more interactive, and if that means a smaller world all the better. Maybe next game will have some dialog and more fleshed out levels, rather than the giant land of dullness."

It's quite accomplished in it's world and character design but does fall a little short on game mechanics, having a basic charged attack that's very tricky to aim and a jump that sometimes struggles to avoid the overly critical hit detection of the side of ledges and walls. Despite it's niggles though, Woodle Tree 2 has allot of character and is often fun beyond it's promise. The price point allows you to try without buyers remorse and it appeals to all ages, so get it for the kids and try it yourself. Also, the world is quite large and has some variations in biomes allowing a slightly different play feel each time. Just don't expect allot of polish in the movement and combat mechanics at this stage of the game.Pros:* Cute Characters and world design* Big world to explore* Fun level design and puzzle elements* PriceCons:* Jumping mechanics can be clumsy* Combat is difficult / uninvolving* Open world elements are sparse, can get lost or find nothing for a long time"

,Recommended,495350,24764222,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,y33t,"So if I'm correct the point of the game is to roam this big world where there are multiple levels such as the beach, desert, moutain, and some others and find 3 droplets that are hidden throughout that specific level. Each level takes about a little over 30 minutes to complete and there are enemies you have to avoid. The enemies aren't really hard, but they do make going through the levels a bit more difficult. You can hit the enemies with your leaf but you won't need to do that the majority of the time. Throughout the world there are hidden things you can find, but I haven't seen what they do yet. This game is sort of a collectathon. You collect these polka dot balls and use them to unlock new colors for your leaf, masks, and other things for your available hand. This game plays fairly well aside from the fact that using the leaf to attack enemies is awkward and you can not change any settings because the game lacks an options menu. Overall the game is pretty fun and cutesie. Definitely worth the price."

76561198066552592,Recommended,495350,25508995,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Yoshi Saur,"Generally, I suggest this game even if some problems still have to be fixed. The idea, the characters and the style of game match very well and I think that Woodle Tree 2 is a remarkable example of a nice indi game.Here some specific critics:PRO- Character. Woodle is a very funny character and his moves are now sensibly improved by new movementswho make the game easy to explore.- Style. Graphic is basic and sometimes maybe too simply, but it is really enjoyable specially for N64nostalgic fans (like me xD). Indeed, the models are expressive and make me think about the great gamesof the past like Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie or DK 64.- Levels. Woodle Tree2 is an open world game, anyway it has a structure based on many levels which arevery various and different. The atmosphere is always relaxing (the difficult level is not too hard)and levels have nice puzzles even if sometimes just too repetitive.CONS- Controls. I don’t know if it depends on my computer, but controls have a strong delay and theframerate is frequently low.- Loading. The same is for the downloading times. They are often too long and cut the game in theaction.- Repetitive. Personally, I’m not a fan of open world games so it is an extremely subjective critic. AsI told, levels are very various, instead, external world is often boring. Spaces are just too wide andempty (even if you can meet some characters in the map) and often you lose a lot of time finding yourway."

I played the first one and loved it. Of course part 1 wasn't perfect, but it was a lovely and easy to finish jump'n'run, where you could relax. But time has changed. This time you have a freakin' huge open world, where you follow a small line of fruits and can ignore like 90% of the world, because nothing to find there. Then the NPC's doesn't even react to your character, you can beat them, try to talk to them, but nothing of that will ever happen. They're only there to let this freakin' huge world look like there was something on it. Next of the super terrible camera, that doesn't show plattforms the right way, so you jump down to the beginning of the level. Why, you might ask? Because you can't die because of height or jumping to death, you always do the whole parcour again from the beginning. If that wouldn't be bad enough already, there are some jumps you need to glitch upwards to actually get to the goal. For god sake, just ignore this peace of crap and play part 1 of the game, because it's better. Maybe not that huge, but it was way more fun to play. (\ô/)"

,Not Recommended,495350,24699242,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Kyle,"I know this is early access and that's exactly why I'm giving it a thumbs down right now. The game has a lot of potential to be great, but it is far from it. It is better than the first, but there is a lot more work needed to be done than the one month that the dev states in the early access description.The game doesn't feel good to control. The animations of the character lag, making movement awkward. The leaf attack is difficult to use because of how long the delay is between the button press and the animation/attack. This is especially true of the shot, I often fire in the wrong direction because I turn after the animation ends but the water droplet fires even later. Those issues combined with the way you get stunned make combat extremely painful.Right Trigger is implied to warp you back to the start according to an in game sign but it does nothing. I had to hold E on my keyboard to warp.I might be missing it but I'm not seeing a HUD anywhere.There are a lot of areas that seemed like side paths that I could explore that were just simply dead ends. Filling the world with more collectables would be nice so you have a reason to venture off the trail of berries that lead to your goal.The game needs better optimization. I jump from 60 fps all the way down to sub 25 frequently.The camera feels like it's on ice."

I am very happy to inform you that this playtime is actually why I've written this review. Let me paint you a picture, for starters.A great friewnd of mine had purchased this game for me as a gift, and we both thought that it had some potential to be fun. Upon loading into the game, I was immediately confused because the camera is inverted by default. This, however, is not the reason for my hatred of this game. That part comes is only a little bit.The story of the game is delivered in a most confusing fashion, but that is mostly forgiven because of the story's simplicity. Why go to extreme lengths to explain a simple ""go find the thing"" plot anyway?I had only gotten to the first steps of the first area for the second time (because of an unfortunate and unexplained death) when my character was removed from the game world entirely. I was not ""glitched into a wall"", or ""set out of bounds"". My game did not even crash. I was simply gone. Removed. Unable to find any trace of myself or my influence upon the game world. My camera was forced to bear witness to the side of a wall for all of eternity. I did nothing out of the ordinary to warrent such a bug or glitch, all I know is that I shall refund this game immediately.I don't know whether this game is actually good; I only ever saw a fraction of the first level. If I were you, dear reader, I'd not take the risk of paying money for this game, even with the promise of a refund in mind. You may be able to get your money back, but your time is forever lost should you encounter an experience similar to my own.SOMEWHAT INTERESTING NOTE: After posting this review initially, one of the developers of the game responded to it and asked for more information regarding this glitch. This act shows that the devs are working hard to fix such problems in the game as what I have experienced. I am very happy to say that I have some more faith in the integrity of game developers now, and the creators of this game have my respect for showing initiative in finding the cause of this srange glitch. Thank you, developers, for listening to your fans and audience in a time where other game-makers would simply ignore them.P.S. The dev's comment can be found in the replies to this review, unless the comment is deleted for some reason."

Even on the lowest graphics setting you can still hit patches of lag, frame rate dives, and random loading screens. The game also has lots of sections that seem incomplete, and a few areas you can get stuck in. I would love it if there were more  information available for what's actually happening with the game. There is a very noticeable lack of instructions or even GUI. I wouldn't mind some text once in awhile, as well as some sort of recognition within the game as far as progress goes. It's also not super clear where you're supposed to go after the tutorial area.As far as I can tell, Online Multiplayer/MMO doesn't actually do anything. You go to the statue, touch the globe, and get a laggy loading screen, then nothing really happens.I honestly think this game has a lot of potential, I really appreciate the changes that were made from the first game to this one. I think that it will take some more work before it can really be considered a proper game, though."

One only other ""wrong"" thing is that the terrain is obviously made off blocks that aren't always stuck together fully, and that can ruin the feel of a real world. Oh, and the world can be a bit desserted.Now, unto the good things.The art style is like for a baby cartoon, but like, actual babies. I enjoy a relaxing game like that after Shadow Warrior and Metal Gear and the likes. I enjoy the simplistic design, and the scenery can be still beautiful with such simple polygons and textures. The gameplay is simple and entertaining, especially when you whack your enemies with leaves and they poof out of existence. Again, baby game.

You fall through the ground, enemies do not react to you, objects turn randombly invisible sometimes, and it will just plain crash sometimes. Even the error log is buggy as it seems to not be able to figure out even how much memory my machie has. Optimization is also apparently some pseudo science the developer doesn't believe in as I managed to turn the game into a slideshow less than 10min in the game in a certain spot. I really can not grasp what the game could be doing to make my machine not be able to handle running it smoothly 100% of the time.If you go to any other direction than the ""tutorial path"" from the beginning, the whole world is ""open"" which in reality means bland and empty. If the first game was bit lacking in level design, this one hasn't been exposed to that consept at all. Sometimes water streams push you if you jump in them, other times they do nothing. A lot of the ""platorming puzzles"" can be skipped by jumping on some other nearby easily climbable block that you can just jump of from and glide over whatever was the ""puzzle"". The only part of the game that seemed to have some sort of level design going for it was the tiny short tutorial section, and that wouldn't have lasted more than 2min (already generous estimate) if I hadn't stopped so often to wonder about everything being so... bad.I also can not understand what possessed the developers to add an ""MMO Mode"" when the base game is still so lacking and buggy.This is going to be the first game on Steam I have ever refunded and will likely stay the only one for a long time. I assumed based on the first one that I could at least have a laugh at an unfinished demo game with a friend, but honestly this isn't even that. This is alpha version of a game that I very much doubt will ever become playable. I've dealt with bad games before, and that's fine, but this one truly is not a full release version worth any money or anyones time.I do NOT recommend this game to ANYONE. If you want a crappy platformer that looks kinda cute, just buy the first one, stay away from this. Even the first one feels like demo version or proof of concept, but at least it somewhat works."

(No information about what to do and how to do it)Then we see some info of how we should walk on yellow tile road...(Oz ref much?)We got three tear drops and had no idea what ""RT"" or ""E"" should do...(?)We run around finding our way back to the place, where tear drops go.No idea how to get to the next area, so we run around a little more and find some beach place where music is like someone gave one year old kid a xylophone to use and they made soundtrack out of it. (I could hear my braincells commit a suicide while listening to that torment)We find a place with some elevator what takes us to a place where we have no idea what to do, we see block what dropped lower level and a high place we cannot reach.Camera spinning around and around, not to even mention what it does when co-op partner fox dies...Then I've had enough...If you enjoy having mental torture and you are willing to pay for it, go ahead and buy this game!"

I went into it expecting something mildly similar to the ""Super Adventure Box"" in Guild Wars 2 and I wasn't disappointed in that affair.The game has seen considerable improvement as time goes on and the developer is both open to player feedback and quick in resolving bugs and glitches.From what I've seen of the game so far there is definitely room for improvement, but it appears to be on the right track."

And finally, it does. I actually feel bad for posting a negative review. These guys have been so kind and fixed the error that simply for that, these guys deserve a reccomended.As for the game:Simplistic and fun. Its a very kid-friendly but sometimes challenging game that has potential to occupy you for hours. my only complaint is the controlls which are a little weird, with no easy way of changing them. But yeah, give the game a try! So cheap, why not?"
,Recommended,495350,29223850,Posted: 13 January,all,emoji movie july 28,This game is a MASSIVE improvment on the original Woodle Tree game. I think that everyone should at least play it for an hour to really get into the game! This is a must buy! :woodle:
