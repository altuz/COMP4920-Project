Thats pretty much the #1 cheese strat. Throw a grenade knock them down go shoot them. It's boring. Even by the end of the game you still have plenty of grenades left. Theres very little tactical gunplay, more tactical grenade play.As for tactical gunplay... well the RNG is in your favor as far as not getting shot. If you're behind cover it's 0.0%-0.6% thats .6 percent chance of getting shot. So maybe in 20 minutes you might kill someone. Best yet, you are pretty much in cover if you go prone... which is pretty much instantanious btw. Which basically forces permanent relocation and grenade cheese strats like above. Theres no differentiating the type of cover, be it a car, a wall, a window, prone. They all work pretty much the same. If someone has a corner on a wall 0 percent chance of shooting them, even from the side. It's not fun...So no private servers, no passwords, no ability to play with a couple people if you want.Matches take forever to start, forever to launch, forever to get in a game, then when you're all dead, it takes forever watching them tap the points wandering around the map for awhile....The ranking system is a blessing/curse. You're at the will of higher ranked players to start the matches, hand out weapons.Graphics 3/5Gameplay 2/5Fun      1/5Fix some of the issues and it'd be better, but I sort of doubt it considering the community that like it how it is. If you haven't followed this game, I'd recommend against buying it.Apparently the grenade tactics have been here since inception... Refunded. I'll check back later."

You move them around with the mouse or keyboard (in this game, learning hotkeys is a must or there's no way you can respond in time to changes in the field of battle). The objective of the game is to either capture victory points (VPs) or to eliminate the other team.You move your units between cover and you try to minimize the percentage hit chance the enemy has on you. The game has mechanics of suppression, including for grenades, and also fog of war (though, it's not indicated as fog on the map, your units have a limited field of view in a cone in front of them).The game moves very quickly, and falling behind can quickly lead to being flanked. However, with good team work and communication you and  your team can also move individual soldiers so optimal positions to snipe, suppress, or kill the enemy and win the game.I reccomend this for anyone who wants a tactical game based on soldier positioning and teamwork.Disadvantagesthe game has a limited player base which leads to many empty lobbies. I'm hoping that will hange with timeIt's hard to manage all the soldiers individually and even with hotkeys I find myself unable to properly command soldiers as I want to.There's a few bugs but for a first steam release I think it's pretty goodA lot of people complain about grenade spam, but personally I think it's ok because of the suppression mechanic."

,Recommended,495580,25412842,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,MedievalHamster,"TL;DR: Great potential, rough around the edges because early access.It's a tactical realtime strategy where you control a squad of four soldiers. Each side has multiple players in charge of a squad each. The goal of each round is either to eliminate all enemy soldiers or to capture and hold victory points long enough to achieve victory.The game reminded me of Close Combat series. There is no base building. Each round your commanding officer makes extra equipment available to you for a bit of customization, but beyond that there is not much you can do to customize your squad. The game is fairly tactical where the winner is determined by who is better at flanking the enemy and by grenades. Seriously, the grenades have played a very decisive role in every battle I've fought so far.There is definitely great potential here, but the game is an early access game, no doubt about that. There is a lot polish missing, there are bugs with the camera system, matches not ending when they should, crashes, etc.As of today there are also not many concurrent users. I've been able to find a game every time I played, but there seems to be just enough people to populate one North America server at any given time. One little gripe I have is the time it takes to play again after your squad gets wiped out (and this will happen a lot when you first start). You go into spectator mode when that happens and wait until the round is resolved. Maybe if you could join another game while waiting, it would feel better but 1) there usually is not another populated game room as mentioned above, and 2) the game crashed every single time on me when trying to leave the game room.So all in all it's good fun when you're on a good run. Patience is advised at other times."

,Not Recommended,495580,27119036,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Tajin,"Challenging, yes.Promising, yes.However, in its current state however there are very few people playing and the gameplay mostly is rather repetitive.1. Keep throwing grenades to stunlock (or sometimes kill) your enemy (every soldier has at least 5!!! of them)2. move closer (dont forget to keep throwing grenades)3. shoot them4. repeatAside from that, it is very limited. You cant lob grenades over walls or bounce them. Your soldiers only move at a set speed, they cant sprint or go slow. They can't climb over low obstacles. There is no supressive fire (big letdown for a WW2 game).The controls are ok but the way the soldiers react to them is somewhat clumsy and often unexpected.For example: If a soldier is aiming at an enemy and you order him again to shoot that person. He will restart the aiming process and usually ends up getting shot for beeing an idiot.Don't get me wrong, the basic gameplay is interesting and it could certainly be fun with larger numbers of players but at the moment there is just too much missing.I might try it again when they've developed it further..."
,Not Recommended,495580,32622290,Posted: 21 June,all,Rogue Joe,They need to reduce the number of grenades per soldier. Even watching the trailer you can tell the game is entirely focused around grenades. The playerbase is extremely low right now. I played the original CoC and I just wished it captured the same feeling. IMO the devs need to reduce nades and increase player base. If they do this the game has a lot of potential but as of right now its just an empty game with a massively broken concept.

I am refunding this game as a community that starts this sorta approach with new people due to experience of having dealt with the bull from another game ( not by same devs but similar no approach on ""improving"" their community) , perhaps AFTER they improve the overall communities way of how to engage the new players to have fun with the game, maybe then I can say I recommend the game..........until then I dont recommend.IT IS EARLY ACCESS, yes we support developers for the FUTURE of the project we have signed (bought) for, but if I knew the community is like this, I wouldnt have even bothered, ""but there are far more worse cases of games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ communities then this one?"" tbh yes, yes there are. but when you make a game that is practically community driven in terms of getting ANY GAMES GOING ( there is no bots, it is an pvp only game, AT THIS POINT SO FAR ). then you might understand my argument?Goodluck to the developers perhaps in the future when you improve the game I will buy it, what you have going is looking great, but I cannot recommend.It is December 12/22/2016 the steam winter sale is going on, and you would think a community would want to have more people enjoy the game then to basically tell them to wait and deal with it."

Your strategy will change as your skill develop and this game strikes a good balance between skill and tactics. You cannot win by only mastering one aspect.This game has a very unique grenade system, which have been called by many names in steam reviews. I must say, it is not one trying to simulate realism. Grenades only kill occasionally. For the most part they stun you, and when players clash they are all over the place. This may look weird and unbalanced to new players expecting a more strictly “tactical” game. However, this grenade system is what, in my opinion, makes the game. It makes the game intense, where skills matter as well.They included AI bots in the release. However, I think the PvP part is where this game shine, and I would say bots are only for practicing controls (Have only tried a couple of games against the AI). Because of the high skill cap, out-multitasking is a valid strategy (albeit a risky one, as mistakes occur more frequently when you (I) try to), and this gets lost when playing the AI.A must buy if you like fast played multiplayer teamwork (PvP) and can handle a game that requires some skills besides your thinking."

As for the grenade spam there new patch adds farther ranges and cooking further encouraging grenade spam, I am surprised the patch didn't add 15 grenades per solider and still at only 5???The graphics are terrible and performance is choppy. The weapons are plain, only one variation of rifle, smg, marksman, autorifleman but doesn't matter cause weapons can't hit broad side of a barn past 10 meters and main focus is grenades.Long story short only buy this game if you like old school bomberman game throwing grenades with a ww2 theme."

Sadly, the servers have been dead for a while now and it doesn't look to be getting any more popular. Typically I see one idle player and 3 empty servers.This does cause a self sustaining problem, no one wants to get the game because multiplayer is dead, but multiplayer is dead because no one will buy the game.The game play was quite fun, though I have only played 2 full games a few months ago, but with the player base in its current condition I cannot recommend the game as it as it is almost impossible to play."

,Not Recommended,495580,33240123,Posted: 4 July,all,Nibutani x Dekomori,Its a great concept but no one plays it anymore. It also feels overpriced above the pricetag of 5 euro since the game is so simple. I would refund it if I could but ive had it for too long trying to find a server to join.

Don't believe me?  Watch gameplay video.Overall rating 2/10Just a cash grab for a game that isn't worth the support anymore.  We've had 20 years of major developments in gaming since this freebie got released via internet explorer."

I was so hyped to play it when i bought it. however, when i got in to the game, i have noticed that the whole server was dead, like there was no one other than 1 guy. can you guess who was that guy?? well he was a developer!! i sended him a message but he just ignored me (maybe he wasnt on pc, lets be fair, I do leave a game on all day when i am not even at home). After 10 min waited for a reply, i closed the game, uninstalled it, asked for refund, and guess what!!! i got my money back.I really do hope with the new Release there would be people and i hope there would be a single player."

Nothing can compare to my baby, Call of Combat, but I can see that this has the potential to come close. Especially since they have re-created the SWAT map!Just an update:Although they wanted to re-create the game with better graphics and physics, it just doesn't capture the magic that was Call of Combat. Due to an unintentional bug in CoC, it allowed for combat via skill. However, this wasn't replicated and as such, the game is dead.Save your money."

Maps are great. one negativ aspect is that this is just a small game and there is just a small amount of playersEDIT: I changed my rating to thumbs down because there are no players ingame ..."
