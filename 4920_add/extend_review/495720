,Recommended,495720,28523542,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,ThatDarnOwl,"Intrude is a simple enough first person shooter running on the Gamemaker engine. It is stylized after 2.5D games from the 1990s like Wolfenstein 3D. Complete with billboard sprite enemies and only being able to view left and right while aiming.The game has a nice retro aesthetic with good action and a reasonably challenging difficulty. Surprisingly enough it also comes with a level editor. However a Steam Workshop has yet to be created for the game and it doesn't appear to be very easy to distribute completed levels as of yet. I will amend this review later if this changes.There are a few minor gripes here and there. The biggest is you cannot rebind your keys, aside from which buttons you use to select weapons. This has caused some minor gripes with players that use different keyboard layouts. The others are more down to personal preference like the lack of a difficulty selection option and the lack of an automap.I do see a lot of potential in this game though. Due to the ease of use of the level editor and the possibilities of further custom content I am eager to see more from it. But as it stands right now if you're only interested in playing the game, it has 15 levels and 5 weapons. Good for a coffee break but not much else."

,Not Recommended,495720,31242131,Posted: 19 April,all,supernaut,"Intrude is very similar to Wolfenstein 3D, a game that hasn't aged well, so I picked this up with the hopes of enjoying a very old experience that's freshened up a bit. On the surface it's lovely, but once you die you start that level again. Your health, armor and ammo carry over from the previous level. So far so good? Not for me. Right now I'm in a level with not much ammo to start with and there are lots of robots in the only corridor I can take. I welcome a challenge, but I'm not having fun anymore. How many times are you willing to play the same level in order to progress? 10? 20? 30 times?Wolfenstein 3D, released in 1992, had a quick save option and 10 slots to save your game. Intrude, released 24 years later, doesn't have anything of the sort and no level select either. If you're fine with all of that, then have fun, cos it's a very cheap game that can only get cheaper during sales."

The game is well polished, has a great visual style, and is decently challenging as well. One thing that personally frustrates me with this game is that if you die it's right back to the beginning of the level. There's no real way to save your progress whilst your in the middle of a level like in the old wolfenstein/Doom games, which isn't the end of the world or a deal breaker, more so just an annoyance. The levels are also a bit repettetive in terms of the same floor and wall textures, however this is slightly eleviated via each levels design. The weapons feel punchy and satisfying to use. But one major thing to not is that this game in no way reinvents the wheel, that is to say It's very similar to the original wolfenstein, though I personally prefer this to that. I'm having alot of fun thus far with the game, and would happily suggest it to anyone wondering if they should get it."
,Recommended,495720,31686500,Posted: 11 May,all,Proxykon,"Intrude is a first-person shooter game developed by Michal Kruba. Reminiscent of old ego-shooter titles like Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM, this game tries to recreate an experience that shares many similarities with legendary milestones of videogame history.PoorBadAverageGoodSuperbExplanationDesign & VisualsXClean low-res visuals, complex layout, visually monotoneGameplayXOld-school gunning, weapon variety, collectiblesSound & MusicXGood soundtrack, fitting sounds, too little varietyAppeal & InnovationXNo changes to old-school formula, less new player appeal, good presentationBonus/Penalty-Ratio (5:3)XBoni outweigh penalties, some missed opportunitiesFinal Score:GoodConclusionIntrude did nothing really new, profits off of nostalgia (which is not a bad thing) and because of the lack of its kind (this is a bad thing for videogames). I looked for new installments of real old-school first person shooters in this day and age and did not find many up to this date. The game may be short, but is in no way disrespectful towards its source material.On the other hand, a little innovation would have made Intrude even better, in my opinion. New ways of structuring levels, a music track for each level for more individuality and more visual variety would not have hurt.Yet as is, the game is still definitely worth its price and praise. I am surprised that so many other people agree with me and that well done recreation is sometimes better than destructive over-revolutionization of older concepts. Reinventing the wheel is not always the best solution and nostalgia should not be shunned.Design & ArtIn style of old first-person shooter titles, Intrude recreates the same looks with animated, low resolution 2D pixel sprites and backgrounds. A double-edged sword in my opinion, since it both revives feelings of nostalgia but also lacks on inherent creativity. I am not saying that the game is copying the visuals per se, but it does very little with the preset of it. One can only see so much grey-in-grey visuals, even if it fits the theme of a secret underground base. Still a noteworthy effort, especially because of the usage of the gamemaker engine, one that is often misused to create crappy horror and 3D shooter titles.Levels (five times three subsets equals 15 levels total) are wide and complex, yet I cannot shake the feeling that more could have been done. While I played through the first levels, only one at the end of the first third surprised me in its structure. I feel that more of these innovations could have given Intrude an even better level structure and made the game more compelling in the end. A missed opportunity regarding the fact that older, nostalgic players and newer, inexperienced players could have been adressed at the same time.Sound & MusicPart of what made me buy the game was its trailer music. I was not disappointed.Intrude uses fitting gritty metal background tracks accompanying its gameplay. Unfortunately, those tracks only change every subset of levels, i.e. only three times plus at the end boss. Probably due to high effort in creating soundtrack for each individual level, yet it would have given every single one a special theme and personality. As is, each level within the same subset feels like the next one. Again, a missed opportunity.Nevertheless, the music and sounds are good and fitting, even with said lack in variety.GameplayThe name IS the game. You are the hired gun to infiltrate a secret underground military base and destroy the accumulated research. What could not be a more generic mission objective in current videogames never seemed so fun in Intrude.Reminiscent to older titles, there is no aiming in y-axis direction, i.e. no aiming up or down. You start off with your pistol and knife, pick up new weapons along the way, search for the exit, uncover secret areas and find collectibles. Sadly, the secrets you uncover are not affecting your gameplay in any way, meaning they are collectibles for the sake of being collected. I wished for secret weapons or other surprises along the way, but nothing like that occured.Two more difficulty modes are available once you beat the game, but these are not simply damage amplified copies of your first playthrough. I am not gonna spoil it for you though.Dying means restarting the complete level from the beginning, which was a real buzzkill at certain points in the game, yet manageable regarding the old hardcore mindset of ""get good or die trying"". Dependant on how much frustration you can tolerate, you can complete the game in less than two hours without the second and third difficulties. Intrude is fittingly priced in regard to the possibly low total playtime. Completionists can expect up to 10 hours.Personal Bonus vs. Penalty (10 points max)BonusThe ""Nostalgia train"" has no brakes.Good soundtrack that kept the gameplay entertaining.Additional playthroughs with changed game behaviour.No checkpoints. No Autoheal. Live or die by your hand!Cheap, considering amount of content that is offered.PenaltiesVisually monotone environment.Missed opportunies in regard to enhanced level structure, soundtrack and collectibles.Possibly frustrating experience when dying too often."
,Recommended,495720,29284631,Posted: 15 January,all,cigarettes,"Intrude is a bite sized old school FPS styled game in the vein of Wolfenstein 3D, with single plane levels, no vertical aiming, maze-like level design, and a Sci-Fi theme. The story is as thread bare as its inspiration: you've entered some sort of facility, and must make your way through it. The graphics are cute and easy to read, and a modern resolution keeps everything crisp. Mechanically the game is solid, with weapons feeling as if they have appropriate weight, and movement being swift. Enemies can be stunned into pain states, and deciding which weapons are most effective against which enemy types is relatively important. Health, ammunition, and armor are sprinkled around stages enough to ensure you have a chance of reaching the end without going completely empty (however mismanage your resources and it's possible to run dry). With three ""worlds"" to conquer, each containing a handful of levels, depending on your pace the game can be completed from under an hour to a couple hours. While short, the well paced heightening of the difficulty makes sure the game doesn't become a cake walk. As with the games its inspired by, you can roam levels to locate secrets, defeat all the enemies, and explode every barrel (doing so in every level corresponds to an achievement). Locating/collecting every secret in the game will also reveal further story elements at the end of the game so it's important to keep an eye out if you're interested. The game also features a level editor, allowing players to create their own stages, however I've yet to personally find anywhere to download these stages. The game also very replayable, with the aforementioned achievements/secrets, as well as three different modes to play the campaign through with (""Normal"" mode, ""Melting"" mode which replaces the bullets of your weapons with energy orbs, and ""Explosive"" mode which replaces the bullets of your weapons with rockets). Overall, for six dollars, you're receiving a surprisingly full package, and I would certainly recommend it at full price (however on sale, I'd say it's a must buy for fans of these kinds of shooters)."
,Recommended,495720,29704480,Posted: 4 February,all,Yaridovich,"7/10Intrude is a short but fun oldschool-like shooter game. The premise is simple: kill enemies on your way, collect ammo/health/weapons/keycards and progress to the end of each level, optionally finding secrets as well to collect extra pickups and data cores. (also, apparently, finding all data cores changes the game's ending)The game also presents a decent challenge level, as enemies deal decent damage and attack quite often. The earlier levels aren't too difficult, but the later levels in the game can be quite hard.While it's a fun game that works as intended, it has a few issues, like enemies that will sometimes hit you even when they're behind a wall (if there is even a single pixel from the enemy showing up from behind a wall, it's possible he'll hit you).But the biggest problem with the game is the lack of content. The game has 2 extra modes, but they just change how your guns work. It also has a level editor, but no workshop to download created levels. There is no difficulty selection, only 5 weapons to use and a small variety of enemies to fight. Once the game is over, there's little reason to replay it except for achievements.Also, the game has no pause. You can press Esc to bring up the menu, but it doesn't pause the game...Also, not an issue, but the noise enemies make when they spot you is weird. Most enemies are humanoid, but the noise they make sounds more like an animal or overall non-humanoid creature...Regardless, for the price the game has, it's definitely a fun and well made game."

Rather simple, yes, but still fun.Mix of melee and range enemies making you switch weapons; levels not too big to make you lost but big enough to make you memorize some sections for navigation purpose, satisfying shooting, minimalistic enemy sprites that look good even on big screen (1080p), smooth movement and framerate. No technical difficulties. I recommend it for all retro fans.tl:dr - small game, but FUN."

,Recommended,495720,29592710,Posted: 30 January,all,Duski: Unboxer Ultra,"(I have not yet completed the game, I am about half-way though but wanted to give feedback and share my thoughts on this game, I will likely tweak and update this once I'm finished)This is really simple, clean fun; Its the pure essence of an FPS and a love letter to the original Doom games.Its not too long, but its priced well and is still alot of fun which I'd much rather have then just more and more rooms and more bad guys to streach out gameplay, its certianly not mind-blowing but its pretty creative with each enemy having their own tactics which you can learn and adapt to. The ""Bosses"" are also great fun and a good challange, I loved how creative the first was and really showed you how fast paced the game can be, really encoraginging you to get into the sprit of coverless shooters.The music is also pretty awesome and really sets the tone and atmosphere, However I wish it changed more often as it can ever so slightly outstay its welcome due to the sames songs used over a span of levels and the musics repetitive nature, I'm really happy I got the soundtrack with this game.The game has no tutorial but I've never found myself frustrated or feeling like I'm missing something, with a few basic controls and FPS player will be familiar with, in that sences its perfect and a nice breath of fresh air from having the first level as an easy learning tool and actively encoraging the player to independantly learn as they go, once again theres nothing you likely have not seen before. However I would really like a sprint button, pacing around areas and mazes you've been to can be a little bit of a bore, also a map would be handy but I've seemingly done well without one so far.In conculusion, the game is like...well a fan game of the original Dooms, its really fun and puts a nice modern touch on the oldies while not having too much or too little, however I would love an expansion or workshop support. If you like Doom, you'll love this, and if you want a nice basic shooter without any forced mechanics, this is definately a game for you.4/5 :3"
,Recommended,495720,33653512,Posted: 19 July,all,3RDplayer,"It's a first person shooter, yes. But don't be fooled by it's retro looks. It's not a wolf3d clone at all. If you die, you have to restart from the beginning of a level. No midlevel saving. Pistol starts are a common thing due to that, because if you die you lose all your weapons too. You are in a constant need for ammo as well. Furthermore, the game includes moving lasertraps and other shenanigans that make your survival a hell. Weapons fire extremely slow too, projectiles are freaking fast and almost impossible to avoid. Hitboxes of enemies are also very questionable at times: You think you hit, but you didn't which can cost you your life.I think the game is a nice time saver for people with very good reflexes or a high endurance for constantly dying and trying again."
,Recommended,495720,33494716,Posted: 12 July,all,Marco Antonio II.,"Over the last years there has been quite an influx of FPS games attempting to imitate the success of the classic games of the 90's era and failing miserably to keep their promises. However this game it's a big exception; it's not another over hyped, buggy early access tittle but a perfectly playable -albeit- simplistic shooter. As it’s been stated multiple times before it takes inspiration from classics games like DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D so if you’re not a fan of 2.5D First Person Shooters I don’t see why would you purchase this in the first place. However if you are into this type of games you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was.While simplistic in nature it remains challenging and it doesn’t take too long to get into. It’s not very long and it will take one to two hours to finish depending how much of an explorer or scavenger you are so it doesn’t overstay its welcome. The levels while somewhat mazy they are actually well designed and vary from corridors to more open areas; and no, the levels are not randomly generated this time around. The game is self-aware of its limitations and while it lacks a map feature (Which might understandably frustrate some) I didn’t get lost that much and I was able to memorize the levels quite well after a while.Something to keep in mind is that this game lacks a conventional save feature (Instead there is a checkpoint save system that will instantly save when you finish a level) meaning that if you die or quit halfway through on a level you’re forced to start the level from scratch. While this is not a necessarily a bad thing (And it makes the game more challenging) the checkpoint system can be annoying especially if you miss a secret or an item meaning that the only way to recover them is to re-start the gameall over againmaking it frustrating if you’re achievement hunting or you’re going for a 100% run for there is no way to check the stats for a level until you’ve finished said level. Something else worth pointing out is that the control customization while present is quite limited; by default the game uses WASD which on itself isn’t a problem but at the time it only allows to change the buttons for the weapons and nothing else which is a bit of a left down (Especially if you use another type of controls). While the defaults suit me perfectly I wasn’t fond of the mouse wheel cycle order and many times while playing I wished I could change it. Hopefully they’ll improve this in the future.The weapon variety while not big or creative gets the job done and each weapon handles differently making them appropriate for different scenarios but are also well balanced and remain useful from start to finish. I never ran out of ammo and I found myself using all weapons often. That combined with how the weapons allow for fast or slow paced gameplay made them quite a joy to use. My only gripe is the lack of gibs for using the rocket launcher but at the very least it remains quite satisfying to use despite that. While there are only 4 weapons (5 total with the knife) I prefer a small but perfectly usable arsenal over a big arsenal where I only end up using a few weapons anyway.There is some decent replay value thanks to the achievements, 2 game modes you unlock after beating the game for the first time (Both which really change the gameplay drastically) and the included level editor which is really easy to use (However with the lack of a steam workshop feature sharing any level you create is a little tricky but not impossible). I really appreciate what they were going for and that the final result is a non-pretentious game that is fun to play and get into that you can get for a reasonable price."
,Recommended,495720,33490611,Posted: 12 July,all,OZKABOT,"The best way I can sum up Intrude is the gameplay of Wolfenstein with the attitude of Doom... and its great!I loved pretty much every second of this gem of a game, and the soundtrack definitely added to that. No joke, this is probably my favourite OST this year so far. The gameplay is simple and well defined, being a good example of less is more, and has the rare sense that when I die, it feels like it was my fault and not the fault of the game. The only part of this game I wasn't a fan of is the final boss, however while I was enraged by my 10th death, all the while it still felt like I was the one messing up and it wasn't flawed game design.I saw many complaints regarding the lack of a map, and while it could have helped, I really didn't feel like I needed one. I got seriously lost and had no idea what to do twice, and even then it was often just me missing a door. Admittedly a map would have helped me find that, but the exploration just added to the game in my opinion. Weapons feel great too, shotty especially, and the enemies give nice feedback. You wouldn't expect such satisying gunplay from this sort of game, but Intrude pulls it off, and then some.I can not recommend this game enough. For £2.99 it's an absolute steal, and is well worth your money. Buy it right now."

The map maker is albeit a smidge clunky as it is just a beta build of it, but it is super easy to learn and start making maps within the first 10 minutes. It will take you some getting used to for testing and continuing working on maps. To load your map you need to enter the file name to load, so just remember what you title it. There is no launch from editor feature which I would love to see, so I have to close the editor and relaunch Intrude to test my map.HOWEVER this still does not change the fact that this game is a real rockstar in my book. It takes the classic touches of wolfenstein, adds some doom flair and synthy metal, and presents you with a highly replayable game. Seriously, I cant talk about the ending with out spoiling anything so just go play it!I am 100% glad I paid for this game, I am just digging so hard core on it.

Let's see here:-Same number of weapons as Woflenstien 3D. I bet you can guess all of them before you play.-Less enemy variation than DOOM. They seem like recolors too.-Similar level design to Wolf. You know:♥♥♥♥♥♥-Narrower color palliate than both. I hope you like grey and brown. At least Wolf was teal and navy.-Easy as hell. You'll only die to insta-death lasers.-Secrets too easy to find. You'll find most of them on accident. This is from a guy who can barely find a secret after E1M1.-Slow as hell; no run button.-Sounds on par as DOOM/Wolf. You know:♥♥♥♥♥♥-Music is generic. I'm not even sure if there's more than 1 song.-Non-existant AI. Normally this wouldn't matter because enemies don't last long in these games, but rocket enemies will kill themselves 100% of the time if you bait them to shoot at a wall when you're in cover. This is just broken.-No autoaim. What? Autoaim a good thing? Yes, in these old school shooters it's very important. Aiming is more of a suggestion than a precision effort. Case in point: the rocket launcher is useless because it fires projectiles that don't have any tracking. Shooting long distances is a chore. The game will force you to do this occasionally.-CHECKPOINT SAVES. In the current year that it is? This is intentionally obtuse.-NO MAP. 100% unforgiveable. Especially if you're not going to put the effort into designing levels.-BUGS. Every corner in the game is bugged. Both you and enemies can shoot through them. Enemies can spot you before you can see them.I was hoping to get like an hour of fun out of Intrude, but I wanted to quit after a half hour. Why does this game even exist? Is it trading cards? It has to be trading cards."

The levels are extremely monotonous, each of them having the same similar, boring, gray aesthetic, some of the game levels are absurdly difficult even on the easiest setting which it's ""normal"" the only difficulty that you have available at the start, apparently the other two are locked, and besides that if you pause the game you can still get shot, almost as if you were pausing in a multiplayer game, instead of a single player fps, the game doesn't allow you to rebind your keys, nor does it allow you to check on a map, that would've been something not only useful, but necessary considering the type of game that this game it's trying to be, When have you ever heard of a game like say Doom, Quake, or Wolfenstein, not having a map.Besides that there really isn't that much to say, the game also doesn't support joysticks, nor does it have vertical aiming, altho this doesn't bother me that much i feel as if i need to mention it.The game however does feel satisfying when it comes to it's gunplay, as well as when actually getting the hang around some of the most difficult levels, but for the price, i really don't know if i should recommend this game, there are just way too many things missing, or flawed, in order for me to not complain about them, but whatever, if you're in need for a throwback of some kind, and just don't want to buy say... Doom (the classic, or the newer one) then this is something to keep you busy from time to time.But that's for a very short, very specific type of time, to time..."
76561197970538611,Recommended,495720,31525976,Posted: 3 May,all,Westenra,"FPS in it's purest form. No z-axis. Find the keys. Kill the bad guys. Hump the walls.The easiest game to compare this to is the original Wolfenstein. Like that game, the difficulty is deceptively rough: Just a few shots kill the bad guys, but just a few shots kill you. However, INTRUDE sprinkles in some modern flourishes, like moving laser walls, AI that goes beyond ""walk toward you shooting"", and enemies that spawn when you activate certain triggers. There are only three looping tunes for the three ""worlds"" you visit (about five levels each), but they are catchy, so you won't mind listening to them over and over and over.My only complant, though more of a caution to potential buyers: There is no manual save. The game automatically saves your progress between each level. If you die, you have to start over from the beginning of the level. If you quit in the middle of a level, you have to start over from the beginning of the level. This wouldn't be so bad on its own, however if you are a trophy hunter like me, you're going to want the achievement for finding all the secrets. If you complete a level without finding each one, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck, because there is no way to restart the level once you've hit that exit switch; your only option is to start over the entire game. Beware!All in all, a quality minimalist throwback to shooter history. Recommended."

Generic maps look the same (same grey textures).Level 5 was very fun, different and entertaining compared to the others. Watch the clip:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COMyUI-si7wOne problem i found was the mouse movement/smoothing to be on the heavy side whether i increase sensitivity or not. Something was not right. Still playable but not the best. You  can always use arrows.Enemies dont drop ammo youll have to find it laying around and ration ammo.Seem to run out of ammo pretty quickly at the beginning.Sound effects and music is pretty good.AI is acceptable sometimes they shoot through walls and seem to move in walls.Overall for 5$ i give it a 7/10."

,Not Recommended,495720,34577022,Posted: 29 August,all,KrudlerTheHorse,"Not related to Wolf or DOOMMini-rant skip down 1 paragraph if you don't want to read:First off how dare the devs compare this to iconic games of the past?!  I'm not going to sit here and break down game design for an hour but you can't just do stuff like that. It is basically a lie to prospective customers.  Could I compare this very review to the masterworks of Shakespeare because, say, they both use English and have punctuation?  Absolutely not!  And that's why I have beef with this game aligning itself with Wolf and DOOM in their marketing.  IT DOESN'T BEAR ANY RESEMBLANCE beyond the most cursory examination.Rant overIt is an extremely basic 3D run-n-shoot with a little bit of ""puzzle"" thrown in.  When I say ""puzzle"" I mean it in the bad game design sense where you run aimlessly from one identical-looking room to the next shooting generic enemies all with the same ""alert!"" sound.  Then track down keycards.  Nothing fun about it, nothing classic about it, just pure monotony.I could have lived with the basic nature and weak game design but the level design is also quite poor.  It is not uncommon to grind an entire map for 5 minutes then die to a moving Laser Gate (placed right at the level's exit) causing a Level Reset.  Basic stuff really.Noting that Laser Gate is the only enemy that will threaten you, the rest of combat is completely boring and easy.  The AI is basically set to run willy-nilly and if they have sight on you they point, wait 1 second and fire.  If you get hit it is because you have reached the point where you are so bored you stop caring.I like the music, the sound, the graphics. I was ready to go easy on this game because I did not expect much past the Store previews, however underlying game design is very amateur."

Doesnt have multi monitor support obviously.- Every enemy has the same look and sound, only the colour changes. The cheapest way to create new enemies since Mortal Kombat. Basicly not a real oldschool fps with the lack of enemies and weaponry...5 guns? Seriously?- Maps have the same texture all over, which means you will have to backtrack a lot. Wolf3D had the same concept, but at least you get a map overlay if you use a proper sourceport.- ""Look at me im an indie dev and i have no idea what vsync is"" - dev probably. Yes kids, another game, where you get 60 frames per sec if you enable vsync, or you disable it. Let me just throw my 144hz monitor out.Music is great, has this classic feel to it. You can also download it for free after purchase. I also liked the hud. It's kind of a shame i have to refund this cause the dev had no proper playtesters, and got no proper feedback. The game itself is not bad to the bone, just needs work. I would call it early access."
