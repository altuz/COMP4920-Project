Herp derp derpity derp. *Drools*I bought this for 89 cents this morning, intending to play a puzzle or two and quit. Now it's 4 hours later, I'm 20 or so puzzles in, and I. Am. Addicted.Hexoscope is a tile puzzle game with the goal being to build a red tiled path between two or more specific tiles. All tiles in between have different directional lines etched into them, allowing you to create one, continuous path. This is a design trope going back all the way to Pipe Mania (and can be seen in games as current as Loop and klocki), but Hexoscope throws in a couple of creative twists.First, you cannot use a ""black"" tile unless you turn it blue...but you cannot turn a tile blue unless you successfully create a path into it with at least 1 red tile (or more in later levels). This results in some apparent roadblocks that might lead one to think that a board is unsolvable: Don't fall for it, because that isexactlywhat this evil little puzzle gamewantsyou to think!! You'll have to backtrack, figure out how to change color on single tiles that can't seemingly be changed, open multiple paths to give yourself the most tiles to choose from, create circuitous paths, or even swap out tiles you've already placed in order to open up new areas to grab the one tile youdoneed andthenrebuild what you've destroyed...whew!...but,manwhen you've solved that board, it will have been properly good and spanked, and you will be its master. Until the next !$*#& board.There are some really thoughtful touches, too: It autosaves on exit. It also allows you to undo your moves all the way back to the beginning of the board. I've asked for a similar ""redo"" button, as the developer seems pretty active on the discussion board (one player has asked for a fullscreen mode, which he has already confirmed will be in the next update). I'll update this review if that feature is added.The one minor flaw is the game's web-translation of its tutorial, but I honestly had no trouble figuring it out and I'm pretty thick. And although it may seem near-impossible, I've not had to restart once. I've had to undo moves many times (once, all the way back to the beginning), but I've never had to re-roll a board  (and the developer hasconfirmed that all boards should be solvable).With the exception of the poor translation though, I'm impressed with how polished it is, especially for a dollar game. I have encountered zero bugs, and the developer seems committed to producing a good experience. Hexoscope is simple in concept, but it will make your brain hurt in the best possible way, and completing a puzzle feels good because of that pain. The music is ethereal and not distracting, the design is crisp, there are timed and untimed modes, and more than one puzzle is unlocked from the start. Although there are 72 boards listed in the menu, elements are randomized, so you could probably play this for averylong time before getting bored (if ever). The amount of strategy in this little game really surprises me.Hexoscope is my new addiction. It's at least a $5 game in a $1 package, and it really deserves a look from puzzle fans. Highly Recommended.

,Recommended,495780,26438508,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,talgaby,"Short version:Hexoscope combines hex-grid pattern-matching/swapping with pipeline type puzzles to create a really soothing, comfortable little game with an astonishing electronic soundtrack.Long version:It is difficult to come up with new basic concepts for a puzzle game, but sometimes combining two already existing ones results in something great. Hexoscope is like that; it mixes tile swapping with pipeline/plumbing puzzles, and glues them together with a nice little trick as a base rule: you need to build the pipeline in order to activate more tiles to swap.The game offers 6×12 stages of increasing difficulty, where each stage only determines the shape of the board and the puzzles themselves are randomly generated. Sometimes the result is almost obvious, sometimes you need to build your pipeline in a certain direction to acquire a tile you need to progress towards your real goal.This means the replay value is quite high, and thanks to the great electronic soundtrack it can be difficult to put this game down. Considering its super low price tag, Hexoscope is a steal, even at full price."
,Not Recommended,495780,24839721,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,D. W.,"Hexoscope has some nice simple mechanics that certainly has some depth, but it's reliance on randomly generated boards often makes the individual puzzles feel dull and lifeless. I found that if I got stuck I could just reset the level until a board came up that was easy to solve. I would also be given boards that were unsolvable from the start. The random generation also really impacts the difficulty curve as you might get a real tough layout for one level then get a real easy one for the following one. It would have been a better game if the puzzles were premade entirely with the random generated boards being their own mode.Still, if you're looking for a puzzle game that has some real nice music/sound design, a great presentation, and is inexpensive then you should consider picking this up. Just be aware that it is very possible to get lay outs that are either impossible to solve or beyond your current understanding of the mechanics."
,Recommended,495780,26117589,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Sweep,In Hexoscope your goal is to build a path from the power generators to the power receivers. In each level you start at the power generator and start placing connectors next to each other to make a path towards the receiver. You move connectors by swapping the position of two connectors. The catch is that you can only move connectors that are either connected to the power generator or are next to a connector that is connected to the power generator. This means that you will have to create paths to different parts of the level to retrieve a connector piece that you need to complete your path to the receiver.Despite being only $0.99 Hexoscope is a very good puzzle game.10/10 From MeSweep

HOWEVER, there are some serious flaws that must be considered:1. Perhaps it is just me, but my mouse just can't move the 'caos pieces' (the bubbles that must be moved to solve the levels). I've checked the settings for the mouse and game and still nothing. Luckily I have a touch screan on my laptop through I manage to play this but still, it's my #1 problem with the game.2. The random layout of each level is too random sometimes, and while I tried to solve the very first level for 5-10 mins the second one took me a minute or two.3. This one is a minor problem but still is there - The is a pts. system in the game that I find nearly usefull, there's nothing you can do with the points you get from each level other but watching them climb up. So you solved a level in a minute faster that your previews attempt, you got 150+ points and then what? It doesn't reward you or something like that, just adds to your total and that's it.As for 1 and 3, if i'm mistaken you could leave a comment corecting me, i'll be thankful but if not, I would love to see these things get fixed/changed/solved. Other than that great game:)8/10EDIT: It turns out I didn't do my research deep enough, you need to disable the touch screen to enable mouse movement. If anyone has this problem too just search the web how to do that, it's rather simple."

The art is simple but good looking, the background track is mellow, and the controls are responsive and smooth.The boards are randomly generated and can lead to some really difficult solutions or really easy ones, so it is not a smooth progression.  Still, you will breeze through the easy levels, and put some thought into the harder ones.I felt I got my money's worth."

I feel like they're trying to set the stage for a mysterious ambiance, but they end up sounding a little strange. Still, once you're through the tutorial you won't need to read any more descriptions so it really is a negligible niggle."
,Recommended,495780,31785069,Posted: 16 May,all,Datatron,Let´s talk about this nice little riddle game. Hexoscope is a hard tile swichting and connection riddle game with an variating interasting gameplay mechanic. The Game itself contain a few worlds with a few riddles. Each riddle has a different layout and different rules to solve it. But here comes there first problem. The tiles you need to moved a randomly generated everytime you start a level or it has been restart. This lead us to the problem that everytime it is to hard you can recreate the so called Chaos to hope for an easier one until you solved it. This makes the level design somehow useless. The next useless thing on the list are the points you earn for completing a level. The amount of points you earn is exactly the same in each worlds and there is no use for them.I recommend this game not because of the hard behaviour more because the mechanics are quite cool to play with and i had my fun with it. But it should not be the best game out there of this genre. So stoppong on this page looking for a really good riddle game you may haven´t found the right one over here.

Also, to clear up any confusion, some reviewers say they had to reset continously to beat a puzzle (levels are randomized each time) but that's not true, all puzzles are solvable. It is possible to make a move that will result in it no longer being solvable but that's why the undo button exists. But from the very start of the level, there is always a way to complete it."

,Recommended,495780,24833879,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,EnioHabev,"First Impressions ReviewGameplayA straightforward puzzle game if you are into those kind of games. From what I was able to go through in a hour of playing it obviously gets more difficult as you progress throughout the game. You can complete the levels in either Normal or Turbo mode. In Normal mode there is no time limit while Turbo has a time limit and you get more points if you complete it. The game doesn't look entirely gorgeous to stand out but the look of the game is there just to be there as it looks to be like from the iOS days two years ago. A solid game from what I saw when I judge it fairly regardless how it took me a while to solve the puzzles.SoundtrackThe soundtrack to this game is interesting but there's only a few music tracks so it does tend to get a bit repetitive. It's electronic music if you like that particular genre. Because of the prize of the game and its soundtrack that you can buy it is a good prize for what its worth.ConclusionI consider this game to be a good timewaster for a puzzle game especially how much the game costs. If you like puzzle games this game will entertain you without a doubt. The game isn't heavy on system requirements as it is a port from iOS it seems. The prize that you get from getting this game is definitely worth your time and good value too. Here is my first impressions when playing some of the first levels in the game from my livestream, you be the judge if you want to give the game a try or not.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrJcYfQFtPU7/10"

The music is very relaxing, the puzzles can be challenging, and a turbo mode is available once you get a grasp of the basics for additional challenge.A feature I would like to see implemented is perhaps a save option for the current puzzle you are on. I personally use this game as a quick brain tease and sometimes don't have the time to finish a puzzle or get stumped and would like to come back to it later. Sure having the option to reset the board can make the puzzles easier, but I like being able to finish a puzzle that seems to have no solution, especially if I can come back to it later.Overall, Hexoscope is a fun unique puzzle game that is well worth the price."
