,Recommended,495890,28561393,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,orpe11,"TL;DR: A fairly simple endless runner game, just enough complexity to show the effort that went into it and make it worth the super-cheap price.Not going to be a super long review, but also likely far more serious than the other meme-based reviews on this game's page.In essence, Montaro is an endless runner game where you are auto-scrolling along the screen from left to right. Your goal is to collect Doge coins, which usually are on the upper level of the screen. After you collect enough, you can purchase new costumes for the dog you are playing as. Ostensibly, the game is based around getting high scores, but notably to 100% complete it, you don't need to be anywhere near good at it, which is a positive if you worry about games ruining your completion percentage.The strategy (and there is a bit of one) of the game revolves around getting to the upper level of the screen, usually by bouncing off of certain objects. Banana peels are the most common and allow you to keep on the upper levels by bouncing between platforms, but each one you bounce on takes a half-panty off your lifebar. If you lose all health, you lose control of the dog for a while, usually leading to death. So the best strategy is to stay up top as long as possible, drop down to refill by flipping up skirts (yes), and then get back up. It is usually safer up top as well, but not always.The hazards in the game come in two forms, instant death and delayed hazard. Instant death is pretty normal for these sorts of games, and in this game comes in the form of sewer holes, flying crows (which you can knock out if you hit them from the bottom while spinning), and angry cats. The delayed hazards come in two forms, chickens and birds. If you hit a chicken, it won't kill you, but instead a certain amount of time later, it will spawn a horde of them along the bottom, which runs left to right, pauses, then comes back. The birds are perched up top, and if you hit them, they'll fly behind the screen, then come at you from the right, adjusting to try and hit your level. Both of these are avoidable initially (just don't touch them), and when they come back, but you are easily screwed by them.The levels do change after a good bit of distance, adding more height, more ways to get up and down the levels, but in essence the game stays the same, with more complexity as you go. Other than costumes and the achievements, there really is nothing more to the game.In summation, Montaro is a exceptionally cheap endless runner game, not a lot of investment in it, but not a lot of substance. Enough effort was put into the game that it doesn't feel purely like a joke though, and that is appreciated."

The chickens throw several emotions in you, all at once, it's outstanding.Dear developers, perhaps fix those errors and add Portuguese language, then Montaro will become and solidify itself as a masterpiece.I'll leave a question in the air: there's reason in things done by the heart?They say it's impossible to find love without losing reason, but for those who have strong thinking, the impossible is just matter of opinion.."

You remember The Last of Us ?, Half life ?, Bioshock? nanananana pathetic, just pathetic. Unreal Engine ?, Cry Engine?, Unity? VR? put dat sh*t down boi. Montaro uses revolutionary 2D Engine never seen before and the animations are almost lifelike. It uses procedural generation and unique gameplay mechanics to achieve combos, collect money and make strategic descisions which have a great impact on the beautifully written story. The music is better than Beethovens ""Für Elise"", Bachs ""Perlude in C major,BWV 846"" or Vivaldis ""Four Seasons"". You steal Panties from school girls, dodge ravens, running chicken hordes or obstacles. You can change your outfit with the money you collected and obtain achievments. In conclusion: This game is a Masterpiece/10 deserves serval Oscars, and a no-bell prize.Buy the game and find true happiness.Again you can steal panties. From school girls. Panties. Just buy the game already"

The colours are warm and friendly, there are a variety of different characters (though we can all agree that the chickens are the best) and the costumes are adorable. I will probably play this game for the next 10 years and still enjoy it. There are no microtransactions, it's play to win, which I love. With that in mind, I would have paid £5 at the most for this game without any complaints, so the price is a pleasant surprise too. While the replay value is great because it's a simple and enjoyable concept, I would like to have seen some more game modes added. Maybe a cliché fantasy platform mode with parody, floor-is-lava-esque gameplay, or maybe a Super Montaro Brothers title in the future? I need more of this beauty.9/10 will play again. Such wow.

The environment is randomised so sometimes you face a full set of obstacles at the same time that makes it impossible to get past which kinda annoyed me because it makes the game less about skill and more about chance that you'll get an easy to play on environment. Other than that the game is really fun and cute ^-^, totally worth the $1.20. Achievents were decently easy to achieve and its a great game to pass the time on.

There is no punishment for failing and you can't lose your progress.This is the most simple and lovable game, I've spent all afternoon playing and it was only one dollar.If you can't think of what to do for a day, buy and play this game.The only negative about this game is you can't choose the soundtrack playing, it selects a loop of a few to continue playing.I'm going to stop typing this review to play more and get my last achievement."

With the Dogecoins you collect while playing the game, you can unlock new costumes for your Dodge, what’s a nice motivation beside the hunt for the Highscore.What I really like about the game is that the Developers made allusions to others Memes. For Example you can unlock a costume that make you look like MoonMoon matching with an Achievement named “Not again MoonMoon”But there are two things that they should have added to the game.First: You can’t choose your jump button, it’s left mouse button. Would’ve been nice if you would be able to change it.Second: There is no Highscore list on Steam for the Game. Would have also been another motivation to hunt for the Highscore. So you’re just running for yourself.tl;drMonatro is a little, but fun and motivating endless runner with a funny touch to it. For the little price of just 0.99€ you can’t make anything wrong here."

(especially for the price)However the obstacle generation is whack.The thing about flappy bird, crossy road, google's infinite runner that pops up when you don't have a connection... their obstacle generator ensures that no matter how difficult things may get: It is your own fault if you fail.That is not the case here. Often you will encounter jumps that are simply impossible (two bannana peels right before a sewer hole)An infinite runner is fundamentally a skill game, yes there's only one button, but you have to press that button with perfect timing as things speed up. Unfortunately skill won't help you with this one, which is sad because otherwise it's a great little $1 title.Most of the positive reviews here are based solely on the meme... which is fine. The meme was worth $1 to me too. However you won't get a lot of milage out of this game when you are overcome with frustration and helplessness thanks to the obstacle generator. (which is sad because this is a relatively easy fix)TL;DR: Good meme, bad game. Infinite runner... untill the generator decides it's time for you to die."

The only control is left click, which isn't that big of a deal I understand. However, you cannot control the height of your jump, so tapping or holding click makes no difference in your distance. This lack of control, in recurring situations, makes some obstacles unavoidable.The artwork in this game is lovely, but the obstacles and platforms blend in with the background, making gameplay more disorienting, especially when you're new to playing. Oh, a poster is on that wall -it must be a decoration. No it's a platform. And because you accidentally jumped on top of it, you missed a pantsu, you lowlife. Cute! There are bicycles in the background. I'm sure it's just artwork to add to the charm-- wat de frak now I'm ded.A majority of your achievements come from unlocking costumes with coins or messing around in the menu. Though the achievement I had my eye on was the ""802 pantsu"" achievement, naturally. I really wanted that achievement... And I got it! But unfortunately, the dull gameplay and the frustrating jump-situation mentioned above prevents achievement hunting in this game from being enjoyable. It felt like a chore. And once you have all the costumes and achievements, there's really no reason to keep playing. I feel that this game was only a frustrating time vampire.I think if Montaro had a shop where you can buy powerups, you would have a reason to keep collecting coins, and a way to make the game more fun.While I personally disliked Montaro, it seems like this game still gets really good feedback. So if you are reading this and are still unsure about whether to try out this game, I say go for it! You might really like it. And it's cheap, so why not?Hope this helped. Happy Gaming!~Xeno"

I got it because it looked like just a cute, simple little game. One that I could play when I felt like playing something but didn't have the time to play very much for very long. Well after a few minutes I knew I was getting a refund, even if it was just 69 cents. Why? Because the game tells you nothing. I died a few times before I figured out that you needed to use the mouse to make montaro jump. Before that I had done wasd, arrow keys, and space bar. Once I figured out how to control the little guy I just got irritated. There is a life system that is symbolized, for what ever reason, by panties. I'm not sure why there is one considering that almost everything that killed me...killed me in one shot. Falling in a manhole, running into something, hitting a crow in any sort of fashion. The first time touching a crow killed me I figured I just needed to jump on it, nope. It kills you every time. There are coins all over the place, but  unless there is something on the ground for you to jump on to get up there you just can't get to them. The dog can't even jump from platform to platform. Maybe there are other controls to get him to jump further or better. Maybe there is a way to kill the things that can kill you. I don't know though, because it doesn't tell you."

It has the cute dog called the ""doge"" and it scrolls. You have absolutely no control of the forward back scroll. That is the first annoying thing. It gives you no instruction at all nor controls. Takes you a little bit to figure out that left click is the only thing to do. I keyboardmashed and didn't find anything else that did anything. So you click to jump and that's it. You jump over things and try to jump to higher levels and try to avoid things that hurt you. Thing is there seems to be a dabate about what can hurt you and when. You can't mariostomp anything. Like the crow. If you death from above landon the crow you die. But other times you can just walk right into it and it dies. Or if you randomly fly into one, it dies, unless you meant to jump on it then you die. There is also amanhole which you can fall down and die. That makes sense. BUt then there is a small fridge with a cat on it that looks like it could be backbground like some of the other things. You touch it and it makes a noise and you die. The death...yeah so when you die you just die. YOu fall off the screen. No extra quarters, no checkpoints...you just die. And have to start over. And figure out what you did wrong. But some things happen kinda randomly. Remember how mad you got in the Centipede arcade game when a quick spider came out of nowhere and killed you? Well there are chickens that can do that. Also there are bananas. It seems they damage you, but you need to land on them to boostjump up to the second level where you can collect coins. You can't buy things, they're just coins. Mario coincs I guess. He didn't need em, he's rich. Once up on the second level you seem indestructible walking through chickens, crows, birds and then bouncing on a banana up again. You can also jump up a girls skirt and get her panties. This must be the almighty selling point of this game. Silly as it is, this heals you a little. The death/damage thing is the big problem. THe starting over EVERY time is the thing that makes me not want to do it anymore. Because it gets old doing the same section over and over without hitting a checkpoint. It needed savepoints or something. I suppose this will appeal to the ""I Wanna Be The Guy"" lovers of the world. But unless you melt over internetmemes there really isn't a ton to like."

I said, ""I stole panties as a meme from 4 years ago."" She asks in confusion, ""You what? I didn't raise you like that! What the hell is a meme?"" I just sit there and cry on my bed realizing that my mother is the only person I talk to and the thing I tell her is ""I stole panties.""Its a nice simple game with a simple concept.

Doge dreams for big things, yet Doge is a little doggo. Doge realizes that to do things, doge must gain money, power, and looks. So doge decides that he will earn money that is scattered throughout the streets of Japan, and buy costumes, so doge can look nice. It took Doge a while to figure out what he needed for power, but in the end, he realized that pantsu is the ultimate form of power among the doggo. Doge then realized he couldn't do this alone. So he has employed your help to help him run through the streets of Japan, take the pantsu, take the money, and become the greatest Doggo who has ever lived."

,Recommended,495890,29452872,Posted: 23 January,all,feloniusm0nk,"Short Review:All in all, the game is nice fun in short spurts, which is in my humble opinion an important aspect of an endless runner. Montaro fulfills that, and by requiring the costumes to be unlocked in order, also satisfies what I believe to be the most important goal, an addictive element. Here, it’s presented as the next thing a person can purchase, and all the player has to do is play the game. Like it or not, the player will earn doge coins and be able to purchase more costumes. But the player will likely like it, and be the next thing he or she looks forwards to. It was for my girlfriend, at least, who is definitively better at Montaro than me.Long Review:I don’t know if this game is available on mobile, but it should be. Purchased on steam, the only button to press is clicking the mouse, which makes the main character, a doge, jump. Despite the ostensibly boring controls, the game presents a number of simple challenges that might better be thought of as a series of short neverending challenges, includes cats that must be dodged as well as those that don't. The further along the doge runs, the more complicated these challenges become as they vary in frequency and placement.The main character excels in cuteness, as he is a doge. The overall potential cuteness of the game is probably lost on some of its potential audience, however, in that one of the resources for the dog to collect in order to complete his challenges are panties. Simply put, the doge must get panties to be able to bounce off of bananas to defeat the challenges and continue his endless running.Earning doge coins is not the actual objective of the endless runner, as the objective is to keep running, but they are earned along the way. These coins let you purchase costumes for doge that increase in price. My only complaint about the game rests here, stemming from the requirement that a player must unlock one costume to get the one after one. The requirement is not my complaint, but the last costume is. Namely, I feel it inferior to at least the six costumes preceding it."

That messages says ""So-and-so is playing a game where you play as a shibu inu stealing panties from school girls...""The only part I saw ""you play as a shibu inu"" and I was sold.The game to heal your heart... awwww.This game is in a similar vein to the mobile game 'Flappy Bird', but I find it more enjoyable. It's simplistic, but the point of the game doesn't really require much. I like that I feel like I don't have to think about it, and then I've fallen in a pot hole or been run over by an angry gaggle of chickens, and I can't seem to hit the start button fast enough. The costumes are adorable, the achievements make me laugh, and the beginning of the game made me giggle with absolute joy.I think this game is worth more than the full price, I feel like we payed way more for similar games in the 90's and the dev should be rewarded more for the fun I'm definitely going to have in the future. I may lose my job, but man, I'll have some Doge at home for me.I definitely recommend this game, (But where is my cursor?)"

Click. I jumped. I started to cry and could not stop. How could such beauty be put into words?

My apologies, no TL:DR either.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a strategic, and competitive game, with an insane marketplace, and in-game economy that builds from it's players. It requires the team to work together in-order to get the win, and of course, knowledge of the maps, and properly developed strategies in order to go against the enemy team and secure the win.You'd think it's just that, right? Wrong. This game requires insane amounts of research, and memory, precision, and skill. To be able to control recoil to perfection, to knowing smokes, and grenade spots for each of its types. Making manouvers in order to outsmart enemies, or maybe just trick them, and decieve them. Of course - you can get help for all of this online, YouTube and such, or learn it yourself as you gain hours progressively.A huge issue with CS:GO, is the cheaters and smurfs that overrule the game, in large quantites. The cheaters, of which claim smurf, or the smurfs, or so claimed to be, which are cheating. Let's discuss.Smurfs:Commonly, ranked above DMG, wishing to purchase a secondary account, to play in lower ranked games. Usually unable to play their own ranks, so they play the lower ranks to feel like they're better at the game than they actually are. Whilst in those lower ranks, accused of cheating a lot due to hours, and rank. ""I'm a smurf"" doesn't cut it anymore, I suppose. These people, when played against make it even harder to rank up after ValvE updated the lovely ranking system, making it a hell to understand, and/or rank up at a decent rate, despite if you're good or bad at the game. Playing against an actual smurf, whom of which is above DMG, whilst you're in Gold Nova, or Silver, is going to be one hell of a time for you, as they will likely have a better understanding than you would at Silver / Gold Nova.Cheaters:Many people mock, and curse the VAC system we currently all know and love. It doesn't work as well as it should, and everybody can admit that, with the amount of people cheating. The only issue is, that people now legit hack. This means, they do cheat, put have configurations/settings of which make it look like they're playing as if without cheats. Maybe, using walls, but playing as if they weren't. This can easily bypass VAC, and leave it to Overwatch to predict their fate, but the majority are very good at hiding such a thing, making Overwatch, a joke like VAC. The thing being, with these cheats, is that they're so well known, and easy to gain access to for a small sum of cash. Commonly cheap, as well. This is an issue ValvE is doing nothing about.The race against cheaters will never end, as programmers and modders will always be out there finding ways to gain the advantage in online games. Cheating, is something that can never end, as it will always be possible, even if it were to be completely illegal to use said cheats. ValvE is implementing a system of which their 'bots' will have a further-developed cheat detecting AI, which learns from cheaters how they operate, and move, and detect inhuman moves, that could not be done. They've currentely got Version 1 of these bots released in CS, of which only detect spinbotters, which is good progress as the processing power required for such a thing, is a large demand. The thing that can go wrong with this; are the shots some people hit, mainly deemed as 'lucky' could be detected as 'inhuman' and therefore, that player being banned. I think the bots submit the player to Overwatch though, which invalidates my point.ValvE are doing something against the issues with CS, but not as much as they could be doing.Don't get me wrong though, this game is a wonderful game, if I'm quite honest, as it truly offers actual thinking as you progress through the ranks, and offers a sense of achievement within the ranking system when you rank up - the community on the other hand, being no better. I do believe the EU servers are insanely screwed, due to such a mixture of different countries, and languages to be dealt with, and it being an issue, on a team, creating strategies, with 4 randoms, of which are usually from Turkey, or Russia, and mic spam the entire time, offering no support just an entire game giving you a headache.This once was a great game, and in sense, it still is. It was only ever ruined by the community, in my opinion."

To protect the young girls many animals in the neighborhood have teamed up to stop Montaro on his quest. Even his own father had long since disowned him, but that did nto stop Montaro, he continued every morning to attempt to steal pantsu. Every time Montaro was knocked down he would just get back up. His determination was so amazing that it even impressed his own father.By getting the most expensive skin for Montaro in the game you can unlock the skin of Montaro's father, who seems to have been inspired by Montaro's never-give-up attitude to not only accept Montaro as his son again, but to join him in stealing the girl's pantsu. Thus Montaro reconnected with his dad and they all lived happily ever after."

It is difficult to tell what is a hazard, and what is not. A box that appears to be a background prop instantly kills the player, but another block that has similar markings (a cat) poses no danger to the player. The scrolling backgrounds could use some more variety. This game would benefit from Steam Friend Leaderboard integration, or simply global leaderboards.However, Montaro is an enjoyable game. Featuring fine music with multiple tracks, enough challange to reward good players and encourage poor players to get better, and an infinite amount of difficulty (as with all scrolling runner style games), Montaro is a recommended mobile-style game, with it's miniscule price point, and easy to understand gameplay."

I wanna believe that devs won't miss the chance to improve it very soon!For the moment, what I can say is fair value for money, with only 1€ you will have several hours of fun! :)"
,Recommended,495890,34078402,Posted: 7 August,all,NanamiOtaku,"Other than the fact that you play as a Shiba-Inu, this game is about collectibles. Collect as many coins to unlock different costumes of the dog.What I didn't expect when I bought this was the fact that the dog has 3 health, despicted as girl's underwear and to gain the health back is to flip the female schoolgirl's in the game.The banana's take half a life and everything else you get in contact with gives you instant game over. It's hard to avoid anything and stay in the game longer.The only controls you have is the left-click mouse button to jump, this game is also a little about timing and strategy which makes it hard because almost everything you touch( except for the girls and the money, as weird as it sounds) basically means you have to start over.I would say this game is good for boredom and laughs. Also, if youu really want to get all the collectibles.Was it worth $1? in my opinion it's okay, it seems like it would work better as a free game but it is quite fun."

For such a simple game, it has a few interesting interactions/mechanics that are not apparent until you read community guides on Steam. The game might not be much, but I can see the developer had fun and dedication while coding it.PS: There is a way to get achievements faster. Hint: Check Steam Guides under the Secret category.

It would be better if there are more controls, such as the ability to crouch (for quickly diving back down from jumping).-A lot of sections of the level are unreasonable and impossible to get by without getting hurt.-It's very hard to tell which objects in the world collides with you, and which objects won't hurt you.The only things keeping my review positive at the moment is the catchy music and cute doge.

,Not Recommended,495890,34425972,Posted: 22 August,all,Gao Li,"4/10 Cute, but that's about thatThis review has been reuploaded toGao Li Occasionally ReviewsMontaro(柴日常：もんたろう) (2016) is a sidescrolling endless runner by JCKSLAP (J西卡被巴) and, sadly, a very boringly designed one at that. There's hardly any gameplay and about five minutes worth of content, which some might suspect is an inherent fault of the genre, but that certainly isn't the case.Autorunners or endless runner games can be quite enjoyable, if a developer puts enough effort into their execution. For example, there are titles like CHILLINGO'sDead Ahead(2013), where players ride a motorbike and can run over, jump on top of, or shoot at all kinds of zombies. Then there's Robot Invader'sWind-Up Knight(2013), in which players have to think quickly as this runner turns into a fast-paced puzzle platformer with the protagonist having to block or execute attacks, jump from wall to wall, or roll beneath obstacles; and finally there's games likeSuper Bunny World(2014) by Lucky Kat Studios, a title that is actually not an autorunner, but an endless auto-scroller. The character controls like one would expect from regular  2D platformers, but the camera keeps on moving right, so players have to keep up to not get crushed by enemies or fall into bottomless pits. Sadly, none of this kind of ingenuity made its way inMontaro.Options Menu and GameplayUpon opening the game for the first time, players will realize that the options menu is comparatively barren and only lets them lower or raise the volume of the music and that of the special effects. There are no graphical options and no means to individualize the control scheme. This means that players can only control the game with their mouse: their left mouse button to be more precise. Upon pressing it, Montaro, the shiba inu, jumps. He has to jump in order to get out of the way of antagonistic poultry, avoid bulky refuse, or collect school girl panties that also happen to replenish his health. However, if he happens to run over a banana peel, he also jumps, which means that players can often simply let go off the mouse without being faced with a game over.As for the life bar, it consists out of three panties with half a panty being deducted every time Montaro slips on a banana peel. Not having any life doesn't kill him though, but merely prevents the player from pressing the jump button for a couple of frames. In fact, the life meter might as well not even exist in the first place as all obstacles and enemies kill the dog in one hit (save for the banana peel), leaving the panty meter to simply be a rather functionless shōnen (少年, aimed at prepubescent boys) trope.ConclusionUnlike other casual titles – e.g.Tetris(1984), orAngry Birds(2009 onwards) –Montaronever truly raises the difficulty as the game progresses, and contrary toFlappy Bird(2013), doesn't incentivize players to improve their reaction times to get ahead. This leaves this adorable little game to be oh so dull and looking like a student project. The building blocks for a great game are there, but not well executed. Lastly, as indicated above, after about 5 minutes, players will have seen everything there is to see and after approximately 2 hours and 18 minutes, they will have unlocked all achievements and collected all trading card drops, independent of their own skill level."

It leads me to believe that this is either a cash-grab, or the devs are relying on its memes and ability to make youtubers rage, to garner publicity for the game.The game is fun for a bit, but it's badly made."

76561198035351615,Recommended,495890,24536413,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Beanus,"Montaro is a cute endless runner that is basically Japan with skirt-flipping dogs and killer birds.PROS* The spritework is endearing and there aren't too many confusing elements in your environment. Dangerous objects are (usually) highlighted in one way or another so you know which ones to put some interest in.*Surprisingly challenging, given that DOGE interacts with obstacles in his environment in ways that aren't very elaborated clearly.*I can dress my dog up as a western gaijin's hound. Ohheckyeah, my dude.CONS* The whole 'nothing is explained to you' aspect, which is more of a negative than a positive. I get it, this game was designed around just picking it up and quickly getting into the action, but I can't get into the action if I don't know how the mechanics work. There's a health system, but it usually doesn't matter because there are a lot of things that can instakill you. You can hit the banana peel after jumping for good air, but hit too many in a row and you instantly die? Collide with a crow midjump (or land on the platform and have the crow fly under and into you) and you also instantly die? Justdon't jumpwhen you come up to a blue basket and you die for it? Maybe it's just me, but arbitrarily finding ways to die just ruins the flow and prematurely ends a run, just for the sake of 'remembering it for next time!'*How come it was revealed so early into the game that DOGE was actually a Russian insurgency droid (later abbreviated as RID) sent to plant a bioweapon in the heart of Japan? Do you have any class, JCKSLAP? Does the term 'natural progression' mean dust upon thine wind? Step your game up dev, the industry isn't going to be revolutionized here.I'm handing Montaro a 7/10, because for all it's faults it still retains the basic elements that an endless runner needs; repetitive yet satisfying gameplay, nice visuals, and a storyline that delves into the depths of dog emotion and how far one shibe is willing to go to serve the motherland."

You can tell its downtown because there is alot of trash everywhere and tons of waifus. Anyway, you left click to jump on the bananas and the objects to get to the doge coins. You gotta collect the doge coins to get more outfits like SUPERMAN DOGE and banana costume doge. Be careful not to run out of panties or the next time you hit a banana you will get banana sickness and not be able to jump. Don't run into the refrigerator cat hes a jerk. Also don't fall in the sewer and don't touch the chickens or the birds. ESPECIALLY NOT THE CROWS! Crows don't care about panties they just kill you. But you can fall on a banana to get super flip doge powers and then you can take out the crows, but not the birbs remember that. So anyway if you run out of panties you can collect some from the long haired waifus walking on the street. The short haired waifus arent lewd enough and their panties won't work. Don't worry about panties too much though as only thinking about panties will make you a pervert and you will lose focus of the true purpose of the game: Collect the doge coins. Meme away!"

It's an infinite runner that would probably work better as a free flash game than a game that you have to spend money on. The running (the only thing you do in the game) is fun the first couple times but gets tedious, espessially as the only reward is costumes, which don't impact gameplay in any way. Again you could probably get more from a free game online, but if you're really interested i'm not going to stop you from buying it.(Side note: i've heared the trading cards are worth alot, so if you're into that this game could be worth a buy.)"

Do you feel you would be happier playing your memes instead?[/h]Well, now you can.Montaro is a fun time-waster, but little more than that. It sees you playing as a doge, stealing girls' pantsu..... Yeah.... It's a wierd game. The graphics are simple but cute, the music is good but forgettable, the gameplay is utterly simplistic, and it's about the only infinite-running one-button game I've ever enjoyed. The variety is actually pretty big, with a multitude of enemy and background types. It is fun for a while, but if you play it for than about 20 minutes straight you start to get a bit bored.I keep it on my computer mainly just for when my wi-fi performs seppuku, just to pass the time as it restarts. And it serves that purpose well."

Montaro has you playing a very simple runner/platformer. Collect coins and replenish your health via panties from the school girls you see traveling alongside you. Sounds easy enough.Except the entire world wants to kill you. I guess we learned from Zelda that chickens (I'm sorry CUCKOOS) aren't to me trusted. Anything avian in this game hates you and wants to peck your little puppy eyes out. At least cats seem friendly. I guess in Asia cats and dogs need to put their rivalry aside for - RACIST COMMENTARY DELETED - so that makes for some adorable sound effects in this game.Other than it's just a simple game, and I certainly mean simple, there's nothing I can really criticize. All you do is click your mouse and amass coins to unlock little outfits. Not much else here than just blow off steam and bust some boredom when other games give you some burnout. Pixelated adorable. Like did you really want this to look like Fallout or something because um...okay. Sit with that group over there.Pretty swell for almost a dollar. Wow doge, much quality, such game!"

Controls/Obstacles are not made clear. It's easy enough - literally just left click to jump. The rest - figuring out what you can/can't touch, and how to get back health is basically trial and error and is learned by playing. But the casual, short nature of the game made that basically a nonissue.I'd love to have some achievements so I can feel accomplished and pretend I'm not wasting my time playing this, lmao.

For .99 cents wouldn't be a bad price if the game wasn't so broken. It's a shame too because I think it could have been a fun game if it weren't for a few things. Now the graphics are really nice, the soundtrack is not bad and the objective of the game is simple. However there are a few things that really bog this game down. You have almost no control over your character other than jump. It is not clear on what will kill you and want won't. For example there are some cats in the background, they don't hurt you except one type. How was I suppose to know? It blends in with the background. The hit detective is off. Sometimes you can kill the crows but most of the time you can't? Why? The worst thing is they cause permanent death. Hordes of chickens also cause permanent death. You trigger them by hitting the one chicken on the fence but most of the time you will hit it because it's unavoidable like most things in the game. If you were to move your character left and right this wouldn't be a problem. I only bought this because it's a game about the doge meme and I wanted to get the achievements because of it but you can't get the achievements. Either they are broken or very cryptic to get. It doesn't explain how to get them. This game needs a lot of work. As of right now it's a 1/10.UPDATE:I revisited the game. The dev has put in the achievements. After a few gameplays you start to notice what kills you and what doesn't. There is still a problem with lack of controls. It'd be great if you can move doge but you can't other than jumping. A lot of objects are very unavoidable and you have to time it right. This game still feels like it's lacking. This game feels like one of those generic app games you find free on your phone. It's just a time waster for easy achievements and cards. 4/10 is my new score."

I will list the things that annoy me the most:- Terribly repetitive, almost zero replay value, you will get all of the costmetic character unlocks pretty fast and that's it.- Settings don't save, every time you open the game whatever character you selected will be reset to default montaro, and SFX/Music volume will reset itself to maxium.- Jump is bound to mouse1, it can't be remaped and there is no keyboard option to jump. Extremely annoying.- Game is windowed at a fixed resolution, there is no changing resolution, no fullscreen option.- Random obstacles often force you into a ""no-win situation"". You avoid one obstacle and land on another one that kills you.Pros:- Cute- Has achievements- Memes- CheapAll in all, I think if the developer cares the overall experience could be improved a lot with a little effort to patch the listed shortcoming, in it's current state I feel it lacking."

,Not Recommended,495890,31780085,Posted: 15 May,all,mumble raps about anime,"An endless runner needs tight controls and accurate hit-boxes to be a quality game. This has neither of those. The jump arc is sluggish on start up and forces you to get use to jumping after you click. When you land from a jump arc, you are forced into several frames of the walk cycle, making it difficult to maneuver around some obstacles. Also the hit-boxes aren't accurate and extend further than the sprites they belong to. The only way you can obtain a high-score is by learning these muddied mechanics, which voids the point of a runner. Anyone should be able to pick it up and play it instantly, not be able to play it after they have died from a faulty hit-box. Options are also limited, you can only adjust the SFX, or adjust the music, which is just more rehashed bit music. Wanted to use something other than click, too bad. Another example of a game being showered in praise and positive reviews for including forced, overused, old, and unfunny memes, with shallow, uninspired, nostalgia pandering noise. But hey, the arts good, not /f/lash loop good, but good."

,Not Recommended,495890,28999133,Posted: 3 January,all,dont boop on snoot,"A cute little game, where you control a 'doge/shibe/meme creature', and jump around a japanese street fighting kittens, avoiding holes, collecting coins, and stealing underwear from schoolgirls. That is about as far as it goes.The game lacks quite a lot in depth and skill requirements. Controls are literally one button. Just jump. This creates a serious flaw, wherein you have no means to avoid obstacles that you have no way of predicting will appear. A simple 'cancel jump' button would work. Google's 'no internet dinosaur jump' game is honestly better controlled.Visually, the game is quite nice to look at. It shows how much the developer worked on this factor, and apart from the whole 'doge' meme, I feel is the main reason people purchase the game. Art style is nice, and nothing feels out of place. Which isn't exactly a good thing in a platformer like this. Objects that you need to avoid or collect become one with the background. Discerning them from everything else is quite a task.The game also has some servere balance issues. Almost everything one hits you. You have a life counter which is in the form of underpants, which you can collect regularly, but the only thing that takes away your life really is banas, which are all over the ground. Every other obstacle instantly one shots you. The placement of hazards also feels quite random, which it actually indeed is. Its an endless runner game. But randomly generated doesnt need to /feel/ randomly generated. The objects are spaced very close together, and you don't get much time to react to the following hazard. There is no feel of combination between the objects, as in you just have to instantly react, but at times due to the placing, you really dont have time. This is a major flaw. This paired with the difficulty in actually seeing hazards as mentioned in the previous paragraph, can lead to you feeling that you died to nothing quite regularly. It's saddening to see the quality of the visuals brought down by this factor.For the price, its a fun little time waster. You got a couple minutes waiting for a friend to come online or finish doing something, load this up. It can feel frustrating and unfair at times, but for less than $1 USD, it's not too bad.If you're looking for a more engaging experience, look elsewhere. I still like tetris more than this."

You collect Doge coins to buy new costumes and steel panties for life energy. Dont land on birds from above or they will knock doge out of the sky! Watch out for the lazy cate, jump over it or it will kill you.Pretty much everything that happens has a delightfully silly sound effect to go along with it.There is no level system just make it as far as you can on a randomly generated board every time. It's rather addictive if you like cute things and 100%ing games. Can be a bit annoying at times since it IS random. There will ocasionally be some combination of obstacles that is actually impossible to overcome but it's been pretty rare in my case.Each costume costs somewhere between 400 and 1000 Doge so the grind can be a bit long to listen to the same 2 songs the whole time, regardless of how enjoyable each of the songs are things still get old. It would be cool if you could unlock different background music too, in various genres. Imagine borking down the street to some super-epic anime style music or death metal, or even classical. I'm imagine a moderate variety of 3-5 extra songs (even if they are other simplistic/silly ones) is manageable?The only serious problem I have with it is the weirdly large hitbox around the ""lazy cate"" that sits on a box and kills you. Sometimes I'm certain I should be clear of it but my foot basically brushes the corner of the box and I'm instantly dead even though I'm stil well away from the cat itself.8.5/10 it's fun and silly and cute and worth your 99 cents"

It's a simple endless runner where you play as a Shiba Inu (more commonly known as a ""doge""). Playing as the doge, you run through the streets of Japan avoiding obstacles including a distressing amount of manholes, angry chickens, black birds that I believe are supposed to be crows, and boxes. You can steal panties by flipping the skirts of girls you pass by, collect coins to buy costumes including a cardboard box (""I'm Solid Doge"".), a banana, and a pair of sunglasses (DEAL WITH IT).Honestly, I haven't seen such an awesome premise for a video game since ""Join a squad of British Special Forces spearheaded by a very British werewolf commando on a mission to assassinate Nazi Archmage Adolf Hitler, who summoned vampires and dragons in an attempt to win WWII"".In all seriousness though, this game costs a dollar and is a good time killer. I'd definitely recommend this purchase.This has been a Robot Maid Review. Thank you for reading."

If you hit a banana from the side, you'll ""slip"" with a bounce.  If it's jumped or fallen upon your following rebounding bounce will depend on the height you hit it from.  Colliding with bananas reduces your panty health by one half a panty.  You cannot contact a lone flying crow.  Bothering a chicken will induce a cackle of hens to scurry back and forth along street level.  Bothering a flock of blackbirds sitting on a fence with induce a flock to fly across the screen at your general location.  Jumping while alongside a girl will restore some of your panty health.Music is nice.Cute costumes.The ordering of obstacles doesn't seem random, but seems to go beyond challenging to presenting many no-win situations.

But it doesn't have anything fun.The randomly generated levels just don't work. Sometimes you can't do anything to doge obstacles, you can decide between falling into a sewer and jumping into a crow. Or you can decide between walking into a banana which catapults you into a flock of chicken or jumping over the banana and landing in the flock yourself. Every obstacle except for the bananas which can be used as catapults instantly kill you even though you have 3 lives.Sometimes you're lucky and survive for 2 minutes, sometimes you already die at the first obstacle after 10 seconds.The game also has lots of tearing.The only thing worth playing for is collecting coins which are scattered on the roofs you sometimes can't even reach. But what for? So you can enjoy not having fun with new costumes.Seriously, this game could be really good, but it needs a LOT more polishing. Sure, it costs less than a dollar, but in the era of indie games you can get way more for that amount of money.Don't get fooled by the positive reviews, the game only gets thumbed up because of the doge meme.

,Recommended,495890,25282819,"Posted: 1 September, 2016",all,CritBit,"TL;DR:Okay, cheap game, Doge references, achievement hunters beware, sort of.So I saw this game on Steam as I was browsing for games one day and, knowing how doge is much wow, very cute(sorry), I bought it, and just for a cheap price of somewhere under $1(my country doesn't use dollars and Steam converted the prices to local currency). At first I enjoyed it, just jumping on cats, stealing panties, accidentally knocking chickens off, the basic gist of the game. The game even ended up as a therapy for me whenever I get too salty playing multiplayer games(not tested by doctors). Then an update came out for the game which featured its achievements actually ""achievable""(it was previously up there purely for display). Having a semi-achievement-hunter mindset, I tried to do these quests and, in the end of the few spare minutes that I had, managed to complete 2/3 of the achievements. Flash forward to 2 days later, I reopened the game after a salty encounter of Counter Strike with bots(I'm a noob and lonely, don't judge me). At first everything seemed normal until I tried to change costumes and realized that the costumes that I bought were relocked and, what's worse, all of my coins are gone. To normal players it may not be as large of an impact but to other achievement hunters and high score beaters this might get frustrating if you accidentally restart the computer because it may reslut in a data reset for the game. Whatever the case, it's not really a big deal in a short run but hopefully they'll be able to fix this in the future, but the present is nice too."

In all honesty, I just setup a autoclicker with my space bar as the trigger and went ham.I give this game a 8/10 doges."

Where you avoid obstacles, steal panties, and see how far you can go.Usually games like this will make you lose interest after a bit of time playing it. But Montaro is so charming and actually has a bit of tact involved gameplay wise that you will play the game then will be hankering for more later on. It's the perfect little time waster. The music can get repetitive though, with only two tracks, so maybe find some cutesy J-Pop or something to play in the background and you're good to go. Stealing panties replenish your ""health"" which is kind of redundant since most of the obstacles kill you instantly. A panty counter would be a nice addition to the game to add another level of interaction and collectable items which would lower the chance of the gameplay getting boring too quickly. Quirky and cute I totally recommend Montaro at the price tag of 99 cents."

Your score goes up buy collecting doge coins throughout the level, collecting school girls pantsu as you walk by, or simply traveling farther in your run. Though the high score doesn't really matter at all. What DOES matter however is the collecting doge coins and pantsu part. Doge coins are used to purchase different skins for your doge to wear on his adventures, while the pantsu are used to recover your health.....which is only used to prevent you from getting stunned as everything besides banana peels kills you in one hit.Overall, Doge...errr Montaro was a very fun relaxing game to play.

I played very seriously, and I was thoroughly enjoying the art and mechanics of this game, UNTIL I unlocked the final costume. I bought each costume in chronological order , and I was VERY disgruntled with the outcome. The very last costume, which I expected to be a solid gold doge, or something cool, to that effect, was very disappointing when I saw a plain white Doge with a red collar as opposed to some sort of sweet terminator/dinosar/magic doge. Look, I think the game is alright, there just needs to be some minor adjustments.3/5"

The music is awesome for the mood and the memes are solid. The bugs in this game are that the levels are procedeuraly generated and sometimes it can be easy to get stuck on the upper level. Also, if your cursor comes off the window the game is in, you won't jump and this led to many deaths where I thought the game simply wasn't responding. Montaro is a super upbeat game that is absolutely worth the $.99 asking price, in my opinion. I hope this gets ported to mobile, since I think it would excel there with its simplicity. The only negative thing I have to say about this game after beating it 100% is that I wish some things were explained better, so I will do that myself.-Very forgiving gameplay. You don't lose your coins upon game over, and there's no lives or continues.-This game has a ton of secrets and easter eggs that are fun to find on your own! Honestly, I was surprised when I started finding them.-The banana peels are not going to kill you! They look like obstacles, but in reality they are tools to access the upper level for coins and the only way you can knock out the crows. There is a bit of a momentum system, so if you fall on one from high up, you'll bounce up pretty high as opposed to just walking into them. Even if you lose your last pantsu, you don't get a game over, you just lose the ability to jump for a moment, so don't worry! I found this to be a good thing since sometimes when you get to an upper level it can be nigh impossible to come back down in time to steal more pantsu before getting dizzy.-Bonus tip! If you click while bouncing through a girl, you can still grab the pantsu! This can be infinitely useful when you are grinding for the ""Never Enough"" achievement. Also, I wish there was a counter for this achievement because I had no idea how long it would take to collect all 802. (It's about 2 hours)"

The game can be challenging. It was more challenging than I had expected from a simple runners game, so I didn't last very long. Maybe I'm just bad?It has no tutorial. Although this game wouldn't need one and would take longer to add into the game, I was confused on whether it was wasd, arrow keys, or mouse at first. I believe the game would be more open with arrow keys.Fun and cute, sure, but doge has died.Other than this the game is really fun. It's great to pass time or just cure up some boredom. As much as I love the game, I will be returning it for a refund. It's not the kind of game I would enjoy on a daily basis, but that's just me. Might as well get my money back if I won't play it."

Doge buys new costumes with said dogecoins and the pantsu fuels his life. (Literally, pantsu = life bar)Montaro is a lot more fun than I had expected. I got this game on sale for $0.89, sorta expected it to be something I play for 10 minutes and get bored of. Well, here I am a few hours later still playing, and trying to get 100% of the achievements. I'll admit, they should add more costumes that are more expensive. You can unlock all the costumes fairly quickly, in maybe an hour or hour and a half. Other than that, this game is great and definitely worth 89 cents, It does exactly what its supposed to do, no glitches or anything. It can get aggravating when you get really far and die though.9.9/10"

The game is a timewaster, you wont get any fantastic visuals or immersive and inovateing gameplay, what you do get is an arcade styled platformer. There is only one control (jump) and the point of the game is to collect as many coins as possible and go the longest without failing. Coins can be spent on the limited customization options and achivements are quite easy aside one which requires hours of grinding. The game also has some depth, every time you click restart or play you get a randomly generated 2-D level which keeps it from being too repitive. The game excels in its category and it believe it would do great as a mobile game. 6/10 not much gameplay but will you keep enertained when needed!"

,Recommended,495890,29051396,Posted: 5 January,all,Yewkaliptus,"Montaro is exactly what you see. It's a cute endless runner/platformer game filled with memes. You play as Montaro, a doge, walking down the street collecting dogecoins and pantsu. The dogecoins are the currency you collect in game which you can use to purchase costumes for Montaro, and the panties are collecting by jumping while walking under school girls. The game is really dividied into two levels. The lower level contains school girls, obstacles like open man holes, dumpsters, and bicycles, and things that will allow you to jump to the higher level, like vending machines, dumpsters, or stairs. The higher level contains the coins, but also its own set of obstacles like crows, and the ever so fearsome chickens and pigeons.  The game provides points the longer your walk lasts, the more panties you collect, and the more dogecoins you collect. However, you'll find yourself less concerned about your score and more worried about your coins until you unlock every costume. The game also features several fairly easy achievements. Most you unlock just by playing the game, but some are secret, although easily unlocked if you're curious enough to navigate the game in its entirety. For such a low price, I'd say this is a must have. It's a simple and relaxing game that you can always return to for some fun.Pros:+ Memes+ Trading Cards+ Genuinely fun achievements+ Cute music+ Cute visuals+ Simply funCons:- Not much to strive for after unlocking all the costumes- The randomly generated levels sometimes create unavoidable death scenariosVERDICT: Good Game, Worth Your Dollar, Would Reccommend."

Whatever the Temple Run currency is with Doge coins, and make the artwork way more cartoony: now you have Montaro. It's addictively fun and a good timewaster in case you got nothing else better to do, or an hour to spare with a laptop/computer in your view. The game also has several delightfully memeful costumes you can unlock by collecting a certain amount of Doge coins and spending them on the costumes.There's not really much else to say about this game other than it's a 2D cartoon rendition of Temple Run, and it's very fun to lose time at. One of my friends also has this game and I remember once that she got addictively frustrated at this game one time, and I couldn't help but chuckle a bit. With that being said, I definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone who has 0.99$ to spare and doesn't know what to spend it on! For what it's worth, you won't regret the purchase.Music- 8/10Storyline- Undefined.Gameplay- 7/10How is the Price??- Very reasonable/fair. I would definitely buy the game at this price.

They would probably be confused. Then again, nobody ever asked me to describe Aesthetic.Montaro is a simple, yet joyful piece of art. Our fearless titular main character weaves his way through streets populated by waves of malicious chickens, pantied young woman, and the occasional ruthless cat. Questions may arise once beginning Montaro, questions such as How do I make this dog jump?, Why does the cat kill me instantly?, or the ever popular How in God's Name are there so many manholes in this town? With the exception of one, none of these questions can be truly answered, much like the perplexing nature of life. Sometimes life puts a banana peel in your way that instantly catapults you into a manhole. Sometimes that's just how life do. That is how Montaro do.In the unlikely event that you, the reader, have stayed until this long in this most definitely terrible review, I strongly recommened that you purchase and play Montaro. Not only is the game charming in audio and visuals, it is entertaining in the purest sense. There are no controls to bog it down, simply one faithful doge standing strong in the face of an unforgiving world, jumping into new possibilties with no hesitance. Let life's complexity fade away as you enter a world of underwear theivery and banana costumes for a shiba inu. Let Montaro's world become your own. Jump with Montaro into a new adventure."

I don't regret the purchase, even if the game is a simple, side-scrolling runner. So far, I like it. The art style is cute. The best part is unlocking achievements, which is surprisingly easy; I'm often playing mindlessly, and then I see a 'doge meme' pop-up. It makes me smile every time.My only issue with Montaro is that I have to rely on the left button of my mouse. I wish it were possible to assign another button, e.g. the spacebar. It would make the gameplay a little easier for me since there seems to be a slight lag between my clicks and the jumping animation. I'd love to use my Logitech controller with this game, too. But it's just not possible. You're stuck with the default left click."

Other than that I kinda expected this to be a side scroller of some sort, but then learned it's one of those auto scroll flash games that randomly generates things as you go on. It IS a side scroller but it's the kind that's designed for the plebian mobile platform.The game is like any other one of these auto scroll games, go one direction until you die. That's it, it kinda gets boring after awhile. Do note the game will decide to kill you without question. In other words this is entirely based on luck, you either will get far in, or you'll die in probably a minute or 30 seconds. Just take that warning into consideration, but then again >Playing for a high scoreI wont slam this game for using a dead joke, but I will say as dead as the joke is, it's at least not godawful looking as some other titles that do. I suggest only getting this when it's on sale, it may be a dollar but for what it is even I think it's more worth it's .50 cent mark."

You know how you can see for example your progression of Team Fortress 2 achievements. This game doesn't have it. I don't know how many pantsu i have to collect until I get the achievement."

It has a nice, standard platform design that works fairly well, and once you unlock a couple of different costumes, you'll want to collect them all, so you keep playing, even though you keep crashing into things and having to start over.

,Recommended,495890,34338693,Posted: 18 August,all,XaivierX,"I. Love. This. Game.It is a simple endless runner, but it has charm!  Guide your dodge through the city streets collecting Dodge coins and keeping healthy stealin' panties!  What's not to like?  Heck, it's even got cats for those cat lovers out there (me included!).So Dodge + Pantsu = So Wow, such Dodge.It does have a couple 'flaws', such as not running full-screen (window streches full-screen by double-clicking the window bar), or having wide-screen support, but really, I enjoy playing this.The achivements are a blast (some are costume unlocks, others are random things).One tip to make your play time more fun:  Hitting the chickens or small birds will cause them to retaliate, avoid them! (You don't put that association together until a couple hours in).Tip #2 for good pantsu:  You can click your mouse button as long as you are near the girls, you don't have to initiate a jump - you can be mid fall, or even summersaulting.  Get those pantsu!"

Take it from a non-weeb like me: This is a masterpiece up there with the likes of Studio Ghibli.Everyone must experience this at least once in their life, it's breathtakingly stunning Japanese Animation at it's finest, and an instant classic.(Montaro's also the first game on Steam I've gotten every achievement for, for good reason.)"

It's pretty fun can get a bit boring after a while I tend to play in short bursts as a time waster, there's nothing really wrong with the actual game itsself it can just get a bit stale after a while. Personally my only issue is that it's stuck in 4:3 ratio and that you can't go into fullscreen but it's only 79p I can't complain.Some of the outfits you can buy with the ingame currency is cute and varied with some popular cultural refrences such as peanut butter jelly time but some are quite high priced without any use a multiplier which means longer grinding.ProsCute soundtrackCute Pixel ArtSurpiringly AddictivePantsu uwuConsGets a tad boring after a whileStuck in 4:3 ratio and windowedPrices for cosmetic items are somewhat steep without a multiplierFinal ThoughtsI say if you enjoy the doge meme and you like shiba's then go a head and get it, it's a fun time waster and pretty damn cheap."
