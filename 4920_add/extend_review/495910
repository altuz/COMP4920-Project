76561198084981362,Recommended,495910,30000223,Posted: 17 February,all,Nytrix,"Played this way back when Nexon NA was still the publisher and quit due to poor handling of the game. Flash Forward into the future and now the game is being published under its actual developers Neople who clearly know how to take care of this game.Gameplay is simple. Its a arcade side-scrolling beat 'em up type game with gameplay mechanics similar to that of a fighting game like Street Fighter. Skills in this game can be activated on input such that as a fighting game or traditionally like MMOs where you do skills on a set skill slot that is activated on the hotkey you set for it. The classes in this game are all unique in that some of them advance to do completely different roles. For example, the female mage advancing to become a Battle Mage which changes her whole playstyle into melee focused dps as opposed to one of her other class advancements such as Elementalist which is focused on bursting down enemies with ranged magic. The level progression is imo pretty fast. The game has a heavy focus on its endgame progression so leveling up from 1-90 per character should take you about 2 weeks or more depending on how invested you are in playing. Since this game uses a fatigue system. If you wanted to keep playing for longer periods of time. You would most likely need to make a new character as each character has their own  separate fp bar. You will be able to learn more about the other classes by doing this which may  help you decide on who you want to main.To follow up from the level progression. You do scenarios which are basically the story quests of the game. DFO's lore is actually pretty interesting if you want to take time to read it when playing. Though its not as good comparing it to the likes of Warcraft or Final Fantasy. The Questing is pretty much scenario after scenario which involves a lot of talking and doing the next part of a dungeon. It can be boring to some (because its so damn easy), but the fp bar basically encourages you to completely exhaust it for the day and I honestly think its better than the original system Nexon had where you didn't have a limit on your character, but would probably get bored quickly because there was nothing motivating you to keep grinding.2D graphics and still has some nice looking visuals for a game originally released in 2005.PVP is something I can't really say much about mainly because I don't pvp at all. I prefer the pve aspect of this game and from what I'm aware of. Its hard to get into with the servers being not as good as other games and is dependent on your ping obviously.The community is very good. Theres barely anyone that would honestly be considered a troll. Most people are willing to help you if you ever need a question answered in the megaphone chat. Joining a guild helps and also benefits you a lot for special buffs, guild dungeons and just a bunch of new friends to play with.As you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've played. I love this game and this playtime doesn't even amount that much from before DFO was put onto the steam store. The one thing I found most enjoyable doing in this game is playing all the classes as you may be one of those players who wants to level up many alts for fun or focus on one character, but still make several other characters as alts benefit you with explorer level, extra dailies, support skill, etc.The game has a pretty decent f2p model currently for a game developed in Korea as most progression is done during endgame for gear. The game patches every two weeks with new events that will help you progress the game with ease. You'll likely not need to spend any money on this game unless you feel like supporting the developer/publishers. I've only spent around 20 dollars on this game for avatars as I like customization. You can customize your characters looks by buying avatars and can also use purchase different colours of dye to make your char look somewhat unique from others. The avatars can change the appearance of the clothing, eyes and the hair of your character. The avatars do cost real money and give stat benefits (clone avatars), but can also be obtained in game from events or purchased from other players at the auction with in game gold.To conclude, I recommend this game to anyone who's into eastern games as its one of the few f2p Korean games that are far from pay2win, fun both solo and with friends. Has flashy looking skills for every class and is just an aesthetically appealing game that you may come to enjoy."

76561198026537281,Recommended,495910,29577904,Posted: 29 January,all,Zylo the Wolfbane,"Take a side-scrolling Beat 'Em Up like Final Fight, Golden Axe, or Shadows over Mystara. Add in MMO elements, 4 player co-op, and some amazingly high-quality sprite art and you get DFO. It's still an MMO, so be warned that a lot of the content when you hit level cap is going to be grinding for gear and doing raids. If you like that, awesome, if not then you can ignore it and do what I do, make a ton of Alts to play through the normal game with new styles, classes, and weaponry. The game has 40+ total classes to choose from, with each base class splitting off into multiple sub-classes, each of which play vastly different from one another. A ton of fun, amazing to play with friends, and completely free. There's no downsides at all!"

76561198014989199,Recommended,495910,29717686,Posted: 5 February,all,brasteir,"I'll be honest, this is a tedious waste of my time. Hell modes are tedious, getting invites outside of events is tedious (so I don't do that anymore) this is my 2nd account. Sometimes raiding is tedious. I have two accounts, only one character on my older account has a BiS weapon.Otherverse on the other hand was improved drastically. Not only is it soloable with the appropriate amount of exorcism but the rooms can only drop equipment for your class. I look forward to running otherverse every day now.Alts are a trap. If you play alts, don't get carried away. Figure out what you really want to play and make sure the appropriate gear goes to that character. Otherwise you'll end up with like 20 characters that have 2 legendaries each and 3 epics between them.All that said it is a fun game, gameplay varies a lot between classes, subclasses, class genders, and even equipment set ups. The frequent events and updates also keep it fresh and it's one of the very few mmorpgs that I actually bothered to reach and do end game.  But believe me it is grindy as all get out."

,Recommended,495910,29906941,Posted: 13 February,all,Nova,"(Long review below. tl;dr: Great game, try it.)IntroDFO is definitely one of the best 'free to play' games I have come across, and for those who don't know, it's basically a Beat 'em-up/MMORPG hybrid, a combination that works really well. There are some annoying 'free to play' aspects, like the ""fatigue"" system and the cash shop, which I cover more in-depth later on.GameplayThe core gameplay (in dungeons) is basically like most beat 'em-ups. You go from room to room, killing everything until you can enter the next one. There are a lot of RPG elements though, like managing your various gear, leveling up, learning skills, crafting, etc.The dungeons are instance-based, so you won't run into random players there, it's only you and any party members you may have with you. Outside of dungeons (in towns) you will see a lot of other players though, and like some other games the players are split up in different channels, which you can freely change between.You will mostly be going through scenario (story) dungeons and do some side-quests here and there until later on when you unlock things like the otherverse, and ancient dungeons. After finishing the scenarios you will begin the real grind, which mostly consists of a lot of farming and/or luck (depending on what you're after).There's 14 different classes and 44 subclasses (with more on the way), all with their own play style. This is one of the things I like the most about DFO. Fortunately you have a lot of character slots as well, though you can only create two characters per day, and if you delete a character, the name will be unusable for 30 days.Graphics & SoundJust looking at the screenshots should give you a good idea what the game looks like. It's mostly good old fashioned pixel art, and it shows that a lot of effort has gone into it. The same goes for the music, which is really nice and varied enough, though if you run the same dungeon over and over you will hear the same song every time (with some exceptions).The fatigue systemYou basically have a limited number of dungeon entries per day. To be more precise, each room you enter in a dungeon costs 1 fatigue point (fp), which you have a limited number of. With this system in place, you can run roughly 25~50 dungeons per day, per character, depending on things like dungeon length and number of fp potions used.This system may seem very limiting at first, but that's mostly because of how fast you burn your fatigue by going through the quick & easy scenario dungeons. Later on it's not as noticeable, especially if you play more than one character. You can also buy potions to restore some of your fatigue points, which should let you run 50+ dungeons per day in average (on one character).The cash shopThere is an in-game cash shop where you can buy things like storage/inventory upgrades, avatars (which change your appearance), and creatures (pets). It's worth mentioning that you can sell some cash shop items to other players for in-game gold, which is in my opinion both good and bad (but mostly bad).On one hand, you can buy some cash shop items without spending any real money, or if you have a lot of cash to burn, you can make some quick in-game gold. On the other, players who spend real money can get an advantage over those who don't, but that's not really uncommon in free to play games, and you can still do very well without spending a ton of cash.ProsAwesome graphics, it shows that they've put a lot of effort into it.Lots of (veryflashy) skills that are interesting and satisfying to use.Really nice and varied soundtrack, it's definitely worth leaving the music on.Lots of classes/subclasses to choose from, all with their own unique play style.Very tight, responsive controls. Works very well with controllers/gamepads.You can reset your skill setup and reallocate all skill points for free.Lots of events coming and going, which helps keep the game fresh (and gives nice rewards).ConsThere isa lotof luck involved in order to get the best end-game gear.The game is too easy when you start out, and doesn't get challenging until much later.Cash shop with items you can buy and then sell to other players for in-game gold.Lack of tutorials/explanations. It's easy enough to find on the internet, though.The fatigue system can sometimes be a bit limiting, but for me it's not a big deal.Entrances and exits (in towns and dungeons) can feel a bit unresponsive at times. Not a huge deal, but most other things feel very responsive.SummaryIf you like beat 'em-ups and RPG elements, you should really try this game. Don't be discouraged by the fatigue system, and remember that you can buy potions that restore some fp. I don't like giving a score, so I'll just end by saying that I really like DFO, and strongly recommend trying it if you think it looks interesting."

,Recommended,495910,29756437,Posted: 6 February,all,Namaste,"What can I say about dungeon fighter... hmm...Graphics: On a scale from Indie game to Witcher 3, well it is rated at..just think of [Don't Starve Together] or [Town of Salem]. TO be fair.. this is an old game. We cannotreally expect an old game to be looking all flashy. Luckily, playing the game with the highest graphic/detail settings will make the graphics look moreHD.Gameplay: Fortunately for me, I had a friend who played alongside me the entire time until I reached level 86. If I was playing this game alone, I amconfident I would have dropped it instantly. Unless you read multiple guides, how are you supposed to know what to do? This game's tutorial is practically NON-EXISTANT!! Without my friend, I would not haveknown which class to pick, which skills I should take, what quests to do,etc. There really should be a tutorial revision because new players will definitely get lost. QueThere are so many events and dungeons that ""drop"" valuable items. But it is all a lie, seriously. When you are a low level player, doing those events are great, wonderful, because good items will droplike crazy for you. Yes you may not be capable of equipping them yet, but it is ok. The secret is to keep it somewhere safe until you can use it. If you try farmingfor these good items once you get to a higher level (70ish-max) your chances of getting the items drop dramatically! I have tested this. I am talking from experience here.Community: VERY LOVING COMMUNITY. Everybody minds their own business but will be glad to help you out.Customization: You cannot customize the facial features but everything else can be customized. Hair clothes etcPvP: One sided. Unfair. Stupid. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Can go ♥♥♥♥ itself.Questing/Story: As a level  86 player I am not ashamed that I have no idea what is going on, I literally have skipped every single piece of dialogue I came across. Why? Because it is not interesting. Maybe thedialogue can be reduced in length, I am here to play a game, not read a bookThe questing is....... pretty much the same thing,repetitive. There are honestly no variations in what must be done. It is always talk to this person, then go fight these monsters, talk to this person.. and repeat x900.That is literally all you do. It feels Soooo grindy. At times this game had me questioning myself about the way I was spending my time.All that aside, I do love this game. It is an amazing game that managed to combine mediocre graphics with a fun style of game play. My favorite part of this game is doing combos and seeinglarge numbers pop up. I love this game. I wish I had found out about it earlier so that by now I would have spent more time on this game.Play this game!!!! You will have a lot of fun!Feel free to send me a message if you want some help getting into the game :)**Just kidding-this is a terrible game my friend forced me to write positive words**"

If youre looking for a classical combo beat-em-up dungeon crawler then this game is definately what you want. Hell, if you just want to play a really fun and diverse game made by a company that actually cares about its playerbase then this game is for you. Each class is unique in its own was and many of them offer more than one playstyle or build. Hitting cap also doesnt take long, in fact Lv 86 is just the beginning of your journey. Go out find a guild and make friendships and kill bosses together or die trying, thats what DFO is all about."

I was really glad when the developers Neople decided to host the game on their own. This amazing game is often overlooked due to it's 'bad graphics' which I acturally find alluring. DFO is a classic beat em up style arcade game combined with RPG elements. The arcade combat makes grinding feel fun especially on hard maps. I love the amazing varieties different classes get, the player is able to 'advance' into a subclass whos play style that suits them."

You could enjoy it since it is basicaly 8/16 bit Beat'm'up like but you're warned.For example you need to launch your Steam under Administrator rights to allow the game install itself (while other games only need Administrator rights for their installer).Another one is that... Launcher doesn't show any info since all info is picture-based and you NEED ADMINISTRATOR rights for IE (in other words you'll need to actualy be under Administrator profile to read the news from Launcher).The funniest thing that I found out by readind Discussion threads is that you can't buy premium cash because of some kind of restriction which is not written anywhere on STORE PAGE.

There should be a time system or something instead its a 24hr wait for the fatigue to come back.On top of it I feel like the game is given it's bases to being where you now have to pay for a lot of things if you are someone that doesn't want to make multiplie characters in my opinion. It was good playing it after a long wait but not worth it.
