The greatest strength is the artwork which looks amazing but I barely got to look at it since I was always in a rush to leave the area as soon as possible before time was up. The only other complaint would be the puzzles were a bit bland (nothing new, typical puzzler obstacles)."

I gave up trying. Yes its supposed to be hard but I progressed about 80% of the way through the game and just decided the continued frustration was not worth my time anymore.

There is barely a story here with little to no emotional attachment to Selma. The controls feel sluggish and not at all what one expects when controlling a wisp. Selma also seems slow to respond in relation to the wisp. You will die many times, which is, I think, what they intended? A mouse seems to work better than a controller. There is potential here and with some work this could be a fun little game rather than a frustrating disappointment."

The fact that you can save oftenly doesn't take away the timed game play. A huge disappointment. I wish Steam lets you know that you're buying timed, quick response games. I wish I had my money back for this game."

Nicely balanced gameplay, after just 2 levels ( which is when I got a handle on mechanics) it has become a pure joy to play. Beautiful graphics, creepy but fitting music makes this a decent Indie game title I would recommend to everyone who enjoyes platform games but would like to try something a bit different than usual run-jump-collect type of game. Overall a definite thumbs-up!"

Pretty graphics and non-invasive music make up a nice atmosphere. Puzzles are intuitive and sometimes moderately challenging. Would love to see an extended version!

Nevertheless an entertaining faily short little platform puzzler."

The overall game mechanics connected with the wisp are refreshing and fun to use.If you are looking for casual gameplay but with great atmosphere of creepyness this is your game."

Really cool way of controlling your main character through this little light thingy. Having loads of fun already. Puzzles aren't too complicated just enough but I assume It's only because I'm on 3rd chapter right now. I like it so far and I'm counting it will stay that way!

Great atmosphere, and some of the puzzle solutions made me grin with pleasure.  Very nice, reccommended.Now the prospect of ""nightmare mode"" beckons - the chance to speedrun the game without dying more than 3 times?  That'll keep me busy for a while."

The music and graphics creates great atmosphere.The puzzles are not too dificult and the end was quite surprising. Unfortunately, the game it's too short, so I'm looking forward to more ;)"

Id recommend it for art desgin itself, even if it wasn't so fun to play as well. Game mechanics are quite tricky, which is fine - giving you extra time to enjoy all the boards, the music and variety of creepy ideas to knock you out of the game.The game logic being challenging, and the overall atmosphere make it worth coming back to. Superhappy with Selma being my first purchase here."

Especially towards the end of the game, what became clear to me was that what you guys really needed on your team was a Game Designer. I feel bad giving this kind of negative review, because very clearly a lot of effort was put into this game. Unfortunately, it wasn't challenging. It was just difficult. And that left me feeling like I wasted my time. Also, LEAST SATISFYING ENDING EVER."
