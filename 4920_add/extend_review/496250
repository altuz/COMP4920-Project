They show a glimpse of what's to come!Here's what i mean:I just played a multiplayer game with a random dude. I spawned in, looked up and saw him looking at me. He waved at me. I waved back.I didn't know what to do to start the match. So i made a shrug gesture towards him. He pointed to the table where it clearly stated what button i had to press. I pressed it and the game begun.We played for a long time. Both of us trying different serves and screws. During the match we did all kinds of gestures towards eachother. Gestures of sadness when you lost an important point while the other celebrates with his hands in the air. Gestures of frustration when you lost a lot of points in a row etc... Body language in VR is really easy to understand. At least to me...It was getting late and i had to go to sleep. I waved, he waved back and i disconnected. Never to see that player again...What's so cool about all this is that you can express yourself without any pre-programmed gestures like /wave, /dance, /whatever. Now you can make your own little dance when you win. You do your own gestures. You do you! It's magical!I can't wait for similar games like this one!I don't mention much about the actual game here except for the VR multiplayer experience.. But the game is actually really good. It feels pretty realistic. Sure it's not perfect... But it is pretty damn close i'd say."

I had the pleassure of helping him test some items. Do you know why he was up late testing and developing? Because ONE PERSON was unhappy with something about his game, so he re-wrote a major part of the game to be better for us all.I got the chance to speak with him one on one and I can tell you without a doubt, he cares about this community and he wants nothing more than for us to just have fun.Game is a 10/10 for meDeveloper is a 10/10 for me as well."

Yep paddle up has captivated me and I'm a terrible ping pong player, but I just put the Vive on and I can't help but load this amazing game up and then proceed to not put it down. I just had an awesome moment with a random guy I met in the UK we ended up going through the roof into the cosmic background map and went all the way to the universe above where we proceeded to hang out among the nebula, stars and planets and talked life and philosophy for a good 30 minutes, which preceded by some really funny role playing.The physics of the ball and the spin are just amazing and I can feel myself improving from game to game.I can't say enough about this game which I'm close to saying has been the most enjoyable gaming experience  I've ever had and I'm totally addicted. I can't wait to see what comes in the future, hopefully some sort of win loss record, rankings, leaderboard or tournaments.

My standard for a great game is than need to be fun, easy to get in but hard to grow, give hours of entertainment and offer an almost flawless gaming experience. More, when is a multiplayer game I expect to find opponents anytime without care too much about where they are or ping, and had fun with them.Paddle Up offer all those things togheter in a very polished package. Run flawless with a good and polished graphics with an humble 970, is satysfing and playable even with modest latency with people on the other side of the earth, you can find opponents in seconds in any hour. I leave to professional players all comparisions about real world phisics. I'm not a pro in billiard too (and played more this one than table tennis), I don't think than Pool Nation simulate 100% of the real life experience, but it's a damn good game and an outstanding muliplayer experience.

It's extremely accurate for the most part - there are some sublte differences you won't notice unless you are a very avid player.  Some of the moves I do in real life don't quite translate, but it's easy to try different moves.This is well worth the $10.00.As a suggestion, the only thing I'd like to be added would be some sort of narrative structure... kind of similar to punchout! It'd be great to play against different AI characters that were a little more varied and maybe some personality.  That bit of flair might really elevate the game beyond just ping pong."

The graphics are pleasant and the physics and sound effects feel right. I've played a few online matches, there was some slight lag but it was playable. My opponents seemed to be from other regions so I assume the latency would be much better under more ideal conditions.I would recommend trying the challenges and having patience when it comes to the difficulty curve of the AI. Some have complained that the AI is too hard but I think those people might just be too impatient. I am now having competitive matches with the ""Skilled"" AI (the third difficulty level out of 6) after only a few hours of play. I've found it to be very rewarding as I had trouble beating even the easiest AI when I first started.Overall I am extremely satisfied for my $10."

As soon as I rotated my head slightly the volume went up- Even though the delay is smaller than in other ping pong games, it's still jarring and should be the number 1 priority to eliminate"
,Recommended,496250,25138302,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,kotsumu,"Let me start this by saying that table tennis has to be my favorite sport all time. I love the sport and I play for fun but I am by no means an expert, or even experienced table tennis player. When I first heard about VR table tennis, my thought process was went a little something like ""I own a VR Headset, I have some money to spare, I love table tennis, hell yeah I'm picking this game up!""I own Ping Pong Waves VR and just downloaded Paddle Up. I was very excited to try Paddle Up based on my experience with Ping Pong Waves VR.GAME MODESHand's down Paddle Up wins in this category, there's so many game modes to choose from. From AI to target practice. I would say the most valuable game mode is the mode that you practice against a trainer machine. You can customize the speed and setup that balls flies in to practice your forehard, backhand, smashes and anything else you can think of. I haven't played Ping Pong Waves VR in awhile but I don't remember as much game modes in that game.PHYSICSThere's two ways that I see physics in these games (simple and complex). Simple physics points to the direction and speed your ball bounces based on the angle and speed your paddle moves. Complex physics points to the changes in behavior of a spinning ball when it hits a surface. Right now, I feel that both games has relatively similar simple physics. The way the ball bounces off your paddle when you don't do any crazy maneuvers feels tight on both games.Complex physics is another story, in this scenario, I feel that both games can use some work with the ball and surface interaction. One thing that I felt that these game lacks is that, even though you can spin the ball with your paddle, the way a spinning ball interacts with the paddle is not reflected accurately. For example, a ball that has a top spin coming towards your paddle will naturally bounce up if the face of your paddle is vertical. If a ball has a down spin, the ball tends to bounce downwards on a vertical paddle. If you have a ball with a top spin, it usually travels faster (travels faster in air, descends faster in air and increases speed more once it hits the table a second time), if you have a ball with a down spin, it travels slower (travels slower in air, descends slower in air, decreases speed more once it hits the table a second time). All these ball to surface/environment (table and paddle) interactions seem to be missing which brings me to the tackiness of the paddle and ball lifting. It seems to be impossible to do the forehand and backhand shots that lifts the ball slightly using the tackiness of the paddle. I also did not see an option to customize your paddle's tackiness which led my to believe that the physics was not implemented in both games. I am by no means criticizing the game's physics, I think they are already super impressive and I understand there are technical limitations. I just wanted to point these out and hopefully these types of comments would help the developer (if they see this).MULTIPLAYERAgain, Paddle Up wins this category. Multiplayer mode was seamless. I clicked to find a match and immediately a player popped up and we played 5 rounds. Even if the player was a horse, it felt like the player was in the same room as me. We said ""Hi"" by waving our paddles. He instructed me with his paddle to press the start button on my menu controller to exit warm up and start the game (I didn't know that we had to at first). We clapped and congratulated each other when a person scores. We shrugged when we missed a shot. We pointed and passed the ball to each other when it was each other's turn. We waved ""Good-bye"" before we left. It's amazing how far technology has come! There was a slight bit of geographical latency between the other player and I, based on the player's movements (the ball moved just fine), but that was to be expected since I really didn't expect the developers to defy physics and break the speed of light. The game was still totally playable however.My multiplayer experience with Ping Pong Waves VR was not as solid however. I queued up for a game which seemed to me like 10 mins, when a player finally joined, we had trouble connecting and the game never started. I gave up and so I never really did have a multiplayer experience in that game to talk about.OVERALLI'm really excited to see where VR will take this genre! I honestly think that the games deserves to be priced more than $4.99 and $9.99. My hope is that they continue to polish their games and eventually we will not be able to tell the difference between real and virtual table tennis! The developers have my 100% support and I proud to have paid for their games. I think that by honing my self in this game, I would be able to surprise my coworkers soon by wrecking their faces in table tennis one day."

Nothing else even comes remotely close to how amazing this already is.- Beautiful graphics and environment (especially when you apply 2.0+ Super-Sampling)- Multiplayer actually works! It's fantastic and even shows you ping - latency to your opponent.- AI is great and the robot/full body animations are a welcome change from just paddles.- Physics are by far the most realistic, especially with the different available paddles.* Needs work on NET code; combatting latency. Right now, if someone has 100+ ping; you will often not see the ball until it's coming barelling towards you, by then it's too late."

Get it if you have room and like TT.Story portion:I try to play an online game and when I get matched and ready up all I hear is the other guy giggling into the mic and just messing around hitting the ball back and forth.

But, I literally taught him the proper (decent) form of how to cut a slow backspin serve just over the net! All this with someone miles away (200 ping type distance). That's incredible to me!As for improvements, the spin is incredible but the things needed are the reactions by the rubber to different spins. Backspin into the net and such.  Also there is no catch from the rubber when trying to loop a forehand shot, it just hits according to the paddle angle and speed.  I'm sure it's coming in a patch."

Firstly the gameplay is fun. Even though there's just the one robot avatar for the AI, it moves convincingly and especially after this first patch seems to make regular people errors. I'm no pro but the ball action seems pretty good. Sound effects and graphics are nice, too. Most of all, as with any game, it's fun.What sets it apart right now from the other early access Pongs is that there's a more complete set of options for customization and practice, and the Multiplayer works well. I've only played with a handful of people and had a blast. There've been a couple of lag induced glitches but rarely have I felt cheated out of a point.The absolute best thing is that you can queue up for a multiplayer match and keep playing single player. That ROCKS. You don't just have to stand there looking at the ""wait"" sign. Pick up the paddle and go, and when your virtual buddy shows up, it switches over. Even better, the game doesn't start right away. You can still hit the ball back and forth for practice volleys and chit chat, but just like a real game it doesn't start until you're both ready. I had fun with another player just doing trick shots and kibitzing before we played. Replay options are also clearly laid out. Super-well thought out!Definitely worth the buy if you like pong."

I was a table tennis captain of Ursinus College, and I would agree that this game is as close as you can be to playing ping pong in real life. The only flaws that this game has is the following:1.) half a second lag after each of the opponent's hit (this is basically just lag because we're online, we can deal with it)2.) Your custom made paddle in real life will not exactly match the exact texture and detail of your virtual paddle.3.) When you hit the ball, you won't feel the exact sensation of hitting the ball in real life, but it's very close because the vibrations of the controllers are trying to make you think you are.These flaws are just something that you have to work with and get used to, but this can definitely help amateurs become better players in real life no doubt, I can feel it especially when you practice constantly with the robopong.If every sports game was as great as this game in regards to accuracy, I would definitely buy all of them.Out of 30 VR games I have so far, I think that this is the 2nd best game I played so far.
