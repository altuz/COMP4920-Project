76561198006413390,Recommended,496260,31808892,Posted: 17 May,all,woosk,"This kinetic visual novel from Frontwing is the first volume of the Corona Blossom series as a comedy with fanservice featuring a male protagonist Keiji Osaki who help out at his grandfather's mech repair and maintainence workshop Osaki Ironworks in a remote Japanese town of Hanma with his female assistant Kumiko Kirishima. One day, a falling meteor happen to crash into an abandoned factory nearby. With his childhood friend Shino Akune, Keiji and Kumiko decide to investigate the crash site which would lead to their discovery of a young catgirl R-ne. As R-ne settles in Hanma town with the inhabitants of Hanma town which include Kanade Hioki, Shino's father, Keiji's grandfather and several minor supporting characters, R-ne's arrival at Hanma town has also attracted the attention of a space pirate ship with the captain Lily Lucalusa Shamony, engineer Yunie Mariette Panini and multiple robot underlings among her crew.Reading through the entire kinetic visual novel will take less than 10 hours. Soundtracks, CGs and overall game presentation are great after factoring in appropriate background music, the use of CGs and animated sprites as well as a great opening and ending movie with theme songs. Theme song DLC is highly recommended for those who like two fast catchy opening and ending theme songs with vocals. Recommended when game is at discount and at bundle offer with subsequent volumes 2 and 3as the game has a cliffhanger ending and the soundtrack DLC is only available at volume 3."

There’s a lot of fan service, the art style is beautiful (very “anime cliche” but it’s ok, it’s still really good), BGM is cute, and the VA is amazing. The story is cool too, but there’s still a lot to explain; I hope that the second game will tell at least a bit more about R-ne’s past.If you enjoy kinetic novels and anime, give this one a chance. It’s a nice experience!8/10."
,Recommended,496260,24624921,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,ＨＥＹ　ＷＡＳＳＨＩ,"I wish there was a neutral button.So I needed a dumb light-hearted VN to wash away some heavy VN (Island, also from Frontwing) I've read the past month. Corona Blossom JP version's to be released at August but the English version got available first and it seemed cheaper so I've grabbed this instead.Story- Nothing to write home about, just the premise of an unknown being lands on Earth and then she's being chased by someone. It's already obvious but the first volume just sets up the plot (I assume) before the second volume comes out.Sound- StandarderogeVN BGMs that aren't really memorable as it's just there to accompany the game. Voice acting is good but cringey but I know what I signed up for.GRAFIX- Seen games (like that train vn) that used E-mote system better so I hope they could add more fluidness to the characters in the next volume. And I'm biased for the art (by ななかまい) as I do love the character design for the game so if you like his art, you might as well as go for it.Characters- Well yeah, you're playing a VN that has no choices so you might as well as focus on the characters and the story. You already have the cookie-cutted characters so you know what their personalities will be. There's not much to talk about. Since volume one is basically an introduction to everyone, I'll be expecting some key points of the character's problem be resolved in the later volumes.Others- 18+ content. While I do somewhat understand the way VN games cost and add that want to make a profit overseas and even the cost to make it even be available overseas, I don't think the price is worth it for just three (good! had fun with these) scenes. Said content can only be accessed in the main menu so you won't get a sudden sex scene while playing the main story.- I do appreciate having both English and Japanese text in the same textbox.- Translation's spot on. If you don't mind the liberties where some text that wouldn't even make sense when translated to English.- It's short, like 4-5 hours long if you skip voices.tldr, it's okay, buy 18+ patch only if you want to, and volume 2 ♥♥♥♥ing when"

From my perspective the character development and story gets a solid 10/10 for sure the animation a 8/10(what was with the too small mouths) and the only rating that everyone cares about my personal enjoyment 10/10 would buy the game 10 times again!!!

76561198025189170,Recommended,496260,25154870,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Will,This is a kinetic novel that will beat you silly with its charm.  Watch as the characters come to life thanks to the E-mote system (like NEKOPARA!).  The story has interesting characters with some real depth to them and also features great artwork and voicing.  I would guess not everyone would think much of the plot but I definitely enjoy it.  There's a lot to like here and I'm really looking forward to volume 2!

Do i need to go on? oh okBasically its a lower rent Nekopara with a bit more story involved, huge breasted females, breast jokes and well the usual mammary related events (yet to find the jiggle key though)+It doesnt try too hard to be what it isnt (no pretensions)funnyCat girl Space Pirates with big guns-Shortpop pulp novel level writing (but hey its a giggle)Its a competently written, funny and light story for the slightly more mature audience, there is partial nudity but nothing you cant see with even a basic look on the net. The graphics aren’t as smooth as Nekopara’s but are perfectly acceptable. There are occasional sound issues with the default settings (some of the characters get drowned out by the music) but these can be tweaked.On a side note the patch isn’t worth the money and only introduces 3 rather creepy H scenes that are nothing to do with the story and only detract from the product"
