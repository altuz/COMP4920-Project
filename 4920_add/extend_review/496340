76561197962207750,Recommended,496340,33837642,Posted: 27 July,all,-CF- Boris_Johnson,"This is a card game version of three gamebooks with a top down 3D environment simply for illustration.There are many FF games on Steam, from book ports, to game versions like this. FF Legends is based on the books City of Thieves, The Warlock of Firetop Mountain and Citadel of Chaos. Firetop already has a game version on Steam, the game mechanic here is different, you're not making any movement choices in combat, it's your card vs. the opponent card and you roll against each other for the outcome.Originally these are dice and choice books, FF Legends keeps these elements, so when you decide to go one path, that's it, you might be able to circle back the other way later, particularly if you die, but it's still a version of turn to page X for this or to page Y for that. And the cards are the enemies you fight and items and spells you pick up.Unlike the four part version of Sorcery on Steam, you don't get constant access to the world map, or any rewinds to undo poor decisions (you can avoid perma-death though through game options here). On the other hand, here you build up your dice the whole time to increase your chances when it comes to fights and tests of luck. So once you become more powerful, you're less likely to be dying at the hands of common criminals in the port, for example.If you are happy with that mechanic, then this is a fun way to open out the text. My only personal preference would have been to retain the original book art for the relevant cards, as many of the other game adaptations on Steam have in one way or another - but if you're not attached to those, then you won't miss them.BOTTOM LINE: as others have said, it's fun to play and attractively priced - you will only be let down if you don't know what to expect and think this is something other than a card based version of gamebooks played with dice."

After a couple of hours (and beers) of wandering, he found no hags.  However, he had become a rather wealthy, rather lucky killing machine that could cut through a couple of city guards with a single swing of his rat-blood encrusted axe.He soon became the terror of Port Blacksand, cutting down the citizenry without remorse.  The merchants (the ones he hadn't killed), however, loved him for buying up every single thing they had to sell.The future looks bright indeed for Baldar!"
,Recommended,496340,33926691,Posted: 31 July,all,Goddard,"If you like me loved playing the FF game books then you will most definetely love this game. Full of references from the novels and with gameplay that is slightly less random and luck oriented and somewhat more forgiving than the book series. Still manages to recreate the brutal and cruel worlds full of traps and monsters that were originally weaved by ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson.Other than that the game looks good and sounds good, but sadly is missing any kind of dialogue which leaves the game feeling slightly empty and soulless. Nothing beats losing yourself in one of the books but this game comes pretty close.7.5/10 Easily worth $10"

This is an amazing game it brought flooding back teen days working my way through Warlock of Firetop Mountain and Citadel of Chaos sheer bliss.In itself the game does what it says on the tin a journey round a part of Titan meeting the bad guys from the books simple to play but lots of choices to make which can affect the outcome of play. The achivements also fit well with the game.For modern gamers used to multiple save points this will be a challenge but that was the joy of the books slowly unwrap what the adventure had to hold by trying failing amd learning to do better.Brilliant Adaption this should go far and with a huge range of Books to base more content this would never get old."
,Recommended,496340,33843806,Posted: 27 July,all,GanjahRebel,"9 out of 10. Great ""classic RPG"" of sorts, feels a lot of what some old tabletop games were like. My only complain would be the motive of the story. Our hero just gets into his/her quest out of nowhere.""Hey my town is in danger, I need your help hero!""""Take this sword, this bag of money, and go kill the Evil Lord""And then you must go on this quest that has probably nothing to do with you anyway. Aside from that, I'm loving it."
,Recommended,496340,33935183,Posted: 31 July,all,Sir Razorback,"Ok, I've never heard of 'Fighting Fantasy' before I picked up this game, but watching some pre-release video of the game made it look interesting. It's a fun time-burner at a $10 price point, but after about 20 hours or so sunk into the game there's nothing left to do.Basically I'd describe it by calling it a Choose-your-own-adventure book meets an RPG. The combat system is dice-based, but encounters are card drawn. As you progress in the game, you earn more faces for your die, improving your odds of overcoming combat or luck resolutions.Once you complete all three level of difficulty there's not much replay left, aside from hunting down achievements. The developer, Nomad Games, is good about listening to player feedback and bug reports, and so far has been fast on the hot fixes.If you have a household where more than one person will be playing, I'd definately reccomend it. A couple of kids who want to play it when you're done makes the purchase more than worthwhile.If the game has any other major downside though, it's that you can't have multiple save games at a given time. You only have one save slot available to you."

How much replayability it will have is open for debate since I assume you will just have the same basic adventures over and over again. I would suggest this is a good little 5 buck game rather than 10 bucks unless you are a fan of the source materials.The graphics were failry nice and I liked the music. I just think they need a bigger soundtrack and more boss battle songs. I think they should get whoever wrote the music to create some more tunes for the game."
76561198085910297,Recommended,496340,34147538,Posted: 10 August,all,zmithy,"Can't recommend this enough, it is a fantastic adaptation of three classic Fighting Fantasy books into a single game. It remains very faithful to the original content, encounters and monsters while allowing more freedom to explore through different options in the manner of a classic top-down exploration RPG popular in the 90's. There are around 20 hours of good quality, really enjoyable content in the main quest lines, and even more if you go for all the achievements and secrets, well worth the modest price tag.I've enjoyed reading Fighting Fantasy books since I was 6, and this game definitely does them justice. I really hope it gets expanded with the content of other books set in the same world since this is the best video game adaption of the classic books I've played."
,Recommended,496340,34871881,Posted: 10 September,all,Darviathar,"As a 40-something that remembers these gamebooks fondly, this game is a real treat, even more so than the Tin Man gaming reproductions of the books that have been available here on steam for a while.  This book ties in 3 of the first 4 fantasy game books from the early 1980's into one long quest quite well.  It is an amazing buy for 10$ and I am left hoping that they will quickly add other books to the existing system."
76561198131037229,Not Recommended,496340,33872033,Posted: 28 July,all,mattwbooth,"Firstly, there is relatively little text in this game, so in that sense it is not like a Fighting Fantasy book.It does faithfully recreate the events of City of Thieves in the  Port Blacksand section, but the way it works seems very much a grind. There is no way to save game or retrace steps, which means if you wish to try turning left rather than right at a given intersection you must return to the start of the city and complete the earlier section again.There seems to be no way of scrolling around to look at the city and check where you have been before. This makes it tempting to get out a pen and paper to make sure you don't take a wrong turn, and have to start the city yet again. It seems like a time wasting mechanism, rather than good game design.If you happen to die you receive penalties to two of your dice. To cut a long story short, this makes your slim chances almost impossible, unless you spend 20 gold to remove these penalties. 20 gold is a lot, so to get it you will have to grind random encounters. The other alternative is to fight random monsters until you increase experience and become unbeatable, aslo by grinding random encounters.In short, the game felt too random and repetitive to be fun."
76561198323169174,Recommended,496340,33933443,Posted: 31 July,all,banneradders,"Fighting Fantasy has seen something of a rebirth over the past three years in the form of comics, new book releases and a video game. Each have been very hit and miss among the old school fans of this brand but NomadGames have sailed through creating not one but three adventure games with an ariel view of the world of Titan reminiscent of the good old 80s computer games such as Gauntlet or Druid. Not only have they padded areas such as Port Blacksand and Firetop Mountain out with multiple nods to the original books, they have added a whole lot more of their own stuff without breaking the consistancy of the Allansian feel.At less that £7 for all three games, this bundle of fun is great value for money and I would call this entry into the world of Fighting Fantasy a resounding success and recommend it to fans and strangers to the world of Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone alike,"
,Recommended,496340,34126945,Posted: 9 August,all,Don Alsafi,"GREAT adaptation of three Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, all in one game.  Very different from Tin Man Games' recent adaptation of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain (which is also one of the three books adapted here), but very very fun.Also, Legend difficulty is hard as HECK.  Just not dying enough to get your hero off the ground is incredibly challenging!"

,Recommended,496340,34120711,Posted: 9 August,all,BlackDog_9,"A challenging, faithful adaptation to three classic Fighting Fantasy Adventure gamebooks. I've seen it referred to as a ""card game"", but the main combat and luck mechanics are dice based. Knowledge and items gained from exploring the many different options presented to you will provide the most efficient and safest paths to success, but it will take you a few goes to learn them!Fantastic journey back to my formative years while I wait for the relaunched paperback versions to arrive :)Absolutely looking forward to some DLC!"

Still, I cannot recommend it.Why? Because it is frustratingly random. The mechanics, the story - everything is bizarre. I walk into a tavern and approach the barkeeper. He draws his dagger shouting he doesn't serve strangers. I attack. He opens a trapdoor behind the bar and a troll jumps out. I kill the troll. The barkeeper apologizes and offers me a free drink.Seriously?Very few options, some with absolutely bizarre outcomes. ""Do you want to be pleasant or demand answers forcefully?"" - Be pleasant. - ""He is enraged by your pleasantries!""Most annoying is the fact that most of the time you cannot go back. E.g. there are multiple, always linear ways to cross a city. You have to do this multiple times, leaving and entering the city again, to get to all the points of interest. With no map to help you! Very frustrating. Oh - and do not hesitate to attack and kill every shopkeeper you come across and break into every house that sparks your interest. Sometimes it's an easy and cheap way to get the items you need. And no worries, you will be forgiven all atrocities and become the cheered hero nonetheless.In the end I kept at it just to see what kind of bizarre ideas I would come across. Like the golden flower that turns into gold coins when it touches dog blood."

I like that fact they could at some stage add a few more adventurers in the Dark Forest (use Yaztromo more) or Fang (Deathtrap Dungeon) for example. The dungeons are easy enough to remember and all up you ll spend about 10-11 hours completing everything on adventure difficulty - it will take alot longer on harder difficulties.

,Not Recommended,496340,33905033,Posted: 30 July,all,Stay_Frosty75,"Refunded.  Not what I expected at all.  I thought as a card game, I would be able to hold some cards in my hand, choose actions, etc.  Nothing like that at all. You roll dice, more dice, be amazed at the constant crappy results, and choose a new path to roll more dice.  It felt very lifeless and random.  I didn't feel connected to the character in any way, or the game world.Game wasn't for me. Maybe I was expecting too much for a pc game.  Looks like a good enough time waster for mobile though."
,Not Recommended,496340,33919824,Posted: 30 July,all,Gentleman Dingo,An incredibly frustrating game. Not sure if I am the most unlucky person ever but I couldn't get a success on any roll to save my life. Literally. Where as my NPC opponents continually roll like 5 of the 6 sides of their dice are successes. From what little I've seen of the story I'm probably better off sitting in my basement and rolling weighted (to fail) dice in my basement and yell at those dice.
