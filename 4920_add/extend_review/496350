,Recommended,496350,24691061,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,LAMBDA,"Likes:OExcellent graphic and cinematography; tons of CGs for a 10-hour long visual novel.OEccentric but very memorable casts. Basically, everyone apart from the protaganist has a few screws loose... in a good way.OGreat voice acting. Unfortunately, the protaganist is not voiced.OGood variety of BGMs and very catchy opening theme song.OInteresting overarching theme about memory and magic.OAbsolutely gorgeous opening movie.Dislikes:XChapter 1 is somewhat simple and pretty basic slice of life story by itself. I guess we will probably get a bigger picture and more depth in the overall plot once other chapters are available.XThe protaganist is quite bland.Remarks:-This is a kinetic novel, i.e. a visual novel with no branching plot, with approximately 10 hours reading time. Thus, gameplay and replayability are nonexistence here.-Avoid this if you are not into slice of life story.-Though the story in Chapter 1 is pretty much self-contained, it definitely end up foreshadowing a potential plot point in Chapter 2.-The entire series can become a hit or miss depending on the upcoming chapters.Conclusion:One of the best looking and soothing visual novel. It certainly have high potential to be a memorable series if the succeeding chapters can add something more interesting to the overarching theme. With that said.... how much longer do I have to wait for the next chapter, damn it! -*-"

It feels like watching an anime.I normally play games in short sessions, but this is the first game, I started to play and haven't stopped after 3.5 hours, it's got me hooked.The BGM is awesome, it really sets the mood and it's different for each place and girl which really makes it different from other VN's.Really looking forward to the next chapaters.If you deciding between this game and a other, buy this one! Jesus christ, just watch the OP which is mind blowing."
,Recommended,496350,24668191,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,Lysis,"(Review by a reasonably long time fan of visual novels with some understanding of Japanese language)Let me first start by saying that minori, the developers for this game, have previously created my all-time favourite looking visual novel eden*. I can safely affirm, after the 9-ish hour playtime on a reasonably fast auto-mode setting, that this superceeds that game to become my all time favourite art in a visual novel. I'll save any spoilers for the story section so feel free to ignore that section if you're interested in getting the story first-hand. I have completed this (English Chapter 1) story and can confirm that at a reasonably fast auto-read speed, it takes just over 9 hours, which is well worth it for the (mind you 10% off first week) asking price, as the shorter visual novels are priced at around £1/hour reading. I would have happily paid about £15/$20/2000￥ for this game, just on its quality.GRAPHICS/ART:As previously mentioned, this is my all-time (as of writing this) favourite art in a visual novel. The game is presented in widescreen 1280x720 (720p) which is a huge step up from the 800x600 visual novels of yore. There is multi-frame lipsyncing for all voiced lines, which increases immersion, and in some walking scenes there is animation of characters bobbing up and down. However, what really makes this game shine is the fact that it is absolutely packed with CGs. Lovely drawn CGs which blend perfectly with the standard portraits. There is a huge amount of depth to the art, and the real draw is how detailled the lighting is, as is what drew me initially toward eden*; there are multiple sets of portraits depending on which direction and colour the light is coming from in the scene, and this really affects the shading on the characters and objects, and this is consistently shown across the whole image. The attention to detail on the art is impeccable. If nothing else, you should get this visual novel just for how nice it looks. Another point I found is that Amano, one of the heroines, is foreign, and this is represented not just by the colour of her eyes and hair as you would expect in any visual novel, but her entire facial structure is designed to be foreign, lacking the large forehead you see in the other characters, and having a longer face in general, something that is reasonably true to life!LOCALISATION:I hate rubbish localisations. I really really do, and I will destroy a review of a visual novel if it's done really badly. I can say that this one is actually ok as they go- there was only one (pretty annoying) problem with this localisation, and one small one. Big problem is that for some reason they've localised the ん (n) in 先輩 (senpai) as an ""m"", and this annoys me. There is no lone m consonant sound in Japanese, shy of perhaps if you have a っ (glottal stop/repeated consonant) before ま(ma)、み(mi)、め(me)、も(mo)、む(mu); even then it's not really treated as a m consonant as it is being treated here. I could understand it if the voice acting was accented enough for it to actually sound like an m but it wasn't so it was a bit of dissonance hearing n but reading m. Small problem is that they rarely swapped surnames and forenames from the voice acting around when writing names.VOICE ACTING:Every character bar the protaganist character is voiced (this is not new to the visual novel scene, but kinda a letdown after the main protaganist in eden* was fully voiced), and the voice acting is filled with a lot of emotion and skill. It definitely is at least medium-tier voice acting staff they've gotten. There aren't many names on the list that you would recognise so I'll spare you the details.STORY/CHARACTERS:Ah, ok here kinda the spoilers begin. I have not exactly seen this story done before. It isn't a full nakige as you would expect from minori, but I have a hunch that it is leading to it (more on this later). It is truly a novel story, and the characters are nice and varied, each with their own schticks and nuances. I can feel the potential for the story to go in multiple directions just by how much extra detail is given about the heroines. The story in this ""chapter"" appears to basically be a slice-of-life story, just to get you in tune with the characters and their circumstances. The game appears to be pointing towards a future nakige type development, but this will probably be in the next ""chapter"". (can I also say that I drew up a genetic similarity diagram and can confirm that second cousins have a reasonably present 3.125% genetic similarity- take from that what you will.)I use the word ""chapter"" because this English Chapter 1 appears to be just about half of the Japanese Chapter 1. Unfortunately in Japan, there is only Chapter 1, as the development of this series was apparently put on hold. MangaGamer is trying to get the second half of Japanese Chapter 1 localised, but as always, this requires money. Purchasing this game will go towards first the English localisation of the rest of Japanese Chapter 1, and then will go towards actually completing this series. minori have not made a Japanese Chapter 2, probably for money reasons, and so your purchase of this game and eden* will go towards funding minori to continue this series!"

Its absolute gem and i love it!Visuals are just amazing, every scene has so mutch movement in it. Characters change direction they are looking depending on who is speaking. Sprites are so well done it almost looks they were drawn with background ... until they start moving :)Story is pretty good, voiceacting is amazing, music is great.Its 10/10 from me.Buy it!Enjoy it!"

Also, effects could've done with a bit more polish as I found the falling petals looked about jerky in the way they moved.Other than that small issue, I loved this story and can't wait to spend more money on chapter 2"

,Recommended,496350,29456865,Posted: 23 January,all,Kiseki,"Charming story, tenmon and minori delivering as always. As the end of Chapter 1 (actually the prologue) foreshadows a ton of content, I would love to see the rest of the project funded.Opening - The introduction movie is just gorgeous. I'll always miss Makoto Shinkai's directing in minori's past OPs but Supipara did an amazing job.Characters - The characters were pretty likeable after a while - Sakura and started off super clingy at first, but you really grow to love her character as she shows new aspects of her personality without the game forcing it in your face. The only character I never really liked was Amano (aka Ange). She was funny for comical relief but her character didn't really make any sense. Part of this may be foreshadowing for her chapter (which will probably never come out).Story - The story of the prologue is very feel-good - there's little conflict as the player is introduced to all the characters. I'm quite fond of visual novels that establish various relationships between the characters - it makes for a more lively story and more believable story. Lots of loose ends however, simply because once again - Supipara is meant to be episodic, and the lack of readers (aka money) is preventing additional chapters to be released.Art - No complaints here, pretty standard Naru Nanao character designs.I vaguely recall buying the Japanese copy when it came out, I'll probably have to go play through Chapter 2 (chapter 1 in Japan) because I need more! You guys should buy the game to get Chapters 3-5 funded!"

Despite being 1 chapter of a series, the story is complete and does not end on any kind of cliffhanger. Even still, it does make you want to read the rest of the series (which no doubt focus on a different character each)."
76561198217936399,Recommended,496350,29117537,Posted: 8 January,all,Expear,"The art style and animations for this is great and the story is excellent. It is not just 4 hours long so you can't watch this through to the end in one day unless you have absolutely nothing to do for the whole day. Not too sure about the ending, it does want the reader to see what chapter 2 may be but for me it kind of seems to make the whole of chapter 1 pointless as it just seems to go through different paths the protagonist takes to which, as the protagonist is telling the story through his eyes seems very strange. Although this may just me since I like to put myself in the protagonist's shoes and the ending makes it hard for me to do so. Definitely not as good as Eden* but still decent enough to read through. Would give around 6.5 / 10. Although this is only my opinion and I know it hard to please everyone so some will hate this and some will love this. If you like VNs then I would say to give this a go before judging this by the reviews."

But I ended up giving up halfway due to boredom. After hours of gameplay, there's little to no progress in the story. The character development in this game is really poor. I think minori is trying something different from their usual drama plotlines but I guess it's just not working for me."
