Experience all-new clunky controls and bad Unity optimizations while fragging NO ONE thanks to the ""multiplayer-only"" system, a videogame trend that gives your games an extremely short lifespan!The ending of the game made me scream with pleasure and my pc scream with an in-your-face system freeze! WORTH IT!Thanks to the fame the Youtuber has got, the game has been greenlit by the Steam community and released instantly as an Early Access product, with apparently no updates on the way. But hey, it is made usingAsset Packs. Steam users loooove Unity Asset Packs. High-quality greenlight products are so mainstream, the videogame market is over-saturated with them.The presentation is clear as crystal, and a very professional one on the Steam page. A Youtuber kid speaking Italian about his ambition to create polished videogames and showing Matthew Mr. Renzie's bad english speeches. Italians have never been so Italian!A well deserved Internet fame, thanks to another Youtuber who likes to brown-nose, even though, ironically, he hates popular stuff for being too much advertised regardless of the quality.Totally recommended to the generic Steam user who likes Steam Trading Cards and overrated youtubers."

I have issues with this game and they are: No servers, Bad controls witch you can not change, 2 Different guns and unbalanced classes. I also have things that I like about the game such as: it is only 0.99$ CAN, It is fun to play with friends, one of the most affordable (TF2 being the exeption) shooters on steam, great game to play if you are bored, almost anything can run it and IT IS NOOB SQUAD!!!!Overall it is ok game. Not the best game on steam by far  but for 0.99$ CAN you have to take what you get. If you could rate this game 'mixed' i would."

Ok lets see what are the problems: the menu is very glithcy- it takes some clicks to join a game- the pause menu is completly fckd (it sometimes flips around, you cant click anything, it wont close...) and the sensitivity button is also very weird...it works but if u set it to 30 it will be rly slow and if u put it to 40 it will cause epilepsyother than that this game looks awesome!and to all you squeekers saying ''eeeewhhh this game has no servers...no players...'' ITS THE FIRST DAY OF THE GAME YOU CANT GET 10000000 PLAYERS IN ONE DAY ON A GAME THAT IS NOT FAMOUS!"

THE MAPS. HOLY GUACAMOLY THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE. You are given thousands of maps and different gamemodes.As far as graphics goes this is a great game, the photorealism of the game is so sick it gave me kreygasm"

This game is bland and terrible for the most part- You could play the Phantom Forces game on ROBLOX and it would be better than this. You can still try it, it's only a dollar. For good reason. It lags terribly,  Has no variety, and has quite an ""Ugly"" feel to it. I really don't reccomend this."

I paid 9 cents for this game, got the trading cards and sold these for 30 cents.Finding a lobby is difficult as there are no people playing it. I found two other players during the 90 minutes I played this game.The game is clunky, the guns feel weird, you can move at the speed of sound if you press ""Forward"" and ""Left"" or ""Right"" whilst Jetpack Jumping, the game has a problem with the UI as you can't see which team holds the objectives.On the plus side: There are some funny english phrases to discover. The developer(s?) probably used the Google translator."
