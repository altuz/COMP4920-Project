,Not Recommended,496600,31738442,Posted: 13 May,all,JDubz,"I figured I would give this game a shot, but I feel like it was a swing and a miss.There's just too many GTA and Minecraft clones altogether. Reminds me of a half *** mobile game withGTA:Minecraft.Anything related with Minecraft should be avoided, it's not likely going to leave you a positive feedback."
,Not Recommended,496600,25923297,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,Alexander26,"This little game tries to be a child of Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto at the same time but fails in so many aspects it gives me headaches.Pros:Nothing / Nada / Rien / Zero.Cons:* Made with Unity Engine; considerable ammount of computer resources wasted for a small game that doesn't really have much to offer;* Sound issues - you only hear sound in the menu, not when you're actually playing;* The game does a poor job at explaining you what do to / where to go; apparently there are 10 missions but you dom't get a clue where to start at least one from.* Ocasional glitches, moments when you can get stuck in cars, environment, NPCs and vice-versa.There's nothing much to do in this game unless you really struggle (due to the relatively slow travel speed, even by car) to find and reach the missions, other than shooting NPCs and policemen until you're wasted (and then repeat).I don't really recommend you buying this game unless you have nothing else do to with your 0.5 $ (like me)."
,Not Recommended,496600,26612203,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,XthemeCore,I can't recommend this game. The light system is wonderful with power of global illumination that already provided by Unity 5. The whole world is empty and too much space. There is a cutscene at the beginning of the game but it doesn't mean anything. I don't know what to do and where to go. Character walk like snail even run still slowly. You called that  jump? seriously!? I try to love this game but sorry. Go away!!!

I had hope.Unoptimized pile of sh*t, lame and it's just empty...Connect to not-existing official server?...If is this meant to be the GTA of Minecraft: nope, just forget it.The really bad thing is that the dev made a similar game before, and didn't learnt anything.Same sh*t, just with other theme."

76561198046196145,Not Recommended,496600,25194326,"Posted: 27 August, 2016",all,Funny name,"Grand theft auto 5 is the newest installment in the GTA Franchise, in this game you play as three characters. Michael: The retired bank robber who is just trying his hardest to be a dad. Trevor: The deranged psycho drug dealer/addict who is one of Michael's old friends. And Franklin: The Gangbanger from the streets who's trying to clean up his act through even more crime. The game has a wonderful singleplayer campaign with alot of wacky characters to meet, and alot of stuff to do. I wish they would add more to the multiplayer though, the lack of heists and cars to collect is really disheartening. All around a really solid addition i give it a 9/10."
