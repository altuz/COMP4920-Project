76561197972151823,Not Recommended,496620,31621623,Posted: 8 May,all,Balinor,"It's a fun game and I've certainly enjoyed my 20+ hours with it on the whole but the deck strategy does not satisfy.You would expect different optimal setups for each of the 12 different classes but no, it always boils down to reduce your deck size to a minimum of cards that draw another and maximise damage.  You don't get to build interesting decks that are based around a theme or anything like that.  It is just cycle cards, cycle cards, cycle cards constantly and it gets dry fast.If you enjoy something that's not terribly well balanced and running small tight hands over varied strategies then sure go for it, but if you are into tabletop games like Legendary then I would skip this."

Peter Whalens masterpiece is an incredible achievement and I've been playing it on my iPad for years.I can definitely see the comparisons. I've been looking for something similar and I'm very pleased to say that Monster Slayers is that game and I'm having a blast with it.The only thing I would moan about is the inventory is too small, if you've got all the characters unlocked there is just no storage space and I seem to lose any equipment I picked up on a run if there's no space left :(Also, I think I should be able to equip any items I pick up on a run. If I get a cool new bow from a monster drop, why can't I swap it out with my current bow? Or any other piece of equipment for that matter?I also think the ui could do with bit of a tidy up with text over other text and often repeating the same information on different parts of the screen.Apart from those two gripes I love this game and hope the dev continues to add new cards with new mechanics to the game.Well done!"

Fun little game, lots of unlockables to make even bad runs feel like they're giving some progress, appealing voices/animations, surprising variety of enemies.Three fairly minor suggestions:--define terms better -- I wasn't sure at first if ""Banish"" meant cards get deleted from the battle or deleted from the game.  Maybe make it so you can mouseover a term to get a definition?--let me improve the skills of a class even if I'm not playing it -- why are all Rogue skills locked if I haven't played a Rogue? I might be more inclined TO play a rogue if I could see the skills!--similarly -- let me see locked skills in general so I know if I want to build toward them"
,Recommended,496620,31609472,Posted: 7 May,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"I avoidedMonster Slayerswhen it was released because I went withDream Questinstead (they released on Steam at about the same time, if I recall correctly). Both titles are almost identical in terms of core mechanic. I feltMonster Slayershad a mobile look and I didn't care for the DLC; it looked shady in a pay-to-play kind of way (at first glance, more on that below).I gotta say,Monster Slayersis superior.The artwork ismuchnicer, and it just plays so buttery smooth. The flow is fantastic. I'm definitely addicted.At this point,Monster Slayersis the best 'roguelike' deck builder I've played.All you need is a mouse, and the one-more-run factor is very high. The one thing that you should know, though, is that it is very grindy. I enjoy the grind, but it needs to be understood before purchase.Unlike other roguelikes/lites, this is in that category of heavy meta-progression. So, for example, no matter how good you are - you will never 'win' the game on the first run.Pros:+Amazingly addictive+Super smooth, and fast, gameplay+Only need a mouse, and the UI is clean and functional+Easy to learn, impossible to master kind of thang+While the DLC looks pay-to-playish, I think its well worth it after I understood the core game is solid+Many many character classes to enjoy+The meta-game progression is beefy and changes the game with timeCons:-Yeah, this title is grindy; just understand this before you go in (no matter how 'good' you may be, you will not win without meta-progression - it's built that way)Totally worth full price."

But looking closely at the store page, I saw this: ""Inspired by the much-loved deck-building RPG, Dream Quest, created by Peter Whalen (Hearthstone)"".Lambasting avoided, I bought this game day 1 because I love me some Dream Quest and a prettier, newer version of DQ is okay by me.  A couple of playthroughs and I'm feeling right at home."
76561198154355650,Recommended,496620,32521563,Posted: 17 June,all,Cujo,"This is what I call a progressive rogue.  As a rogue, you die alot so do not become attached to that one character.  But there is progression, that you earn fame which enables you to unlock special abilities to carry over to your new character and companions for the next run.  In addition, any loot you gain or buy from merchants carry over to your next character.  There are about 8 character types to pick from such as mage, cleric, theif, barbarian, etc.  Plus you get an additional two companions which you meet up at the first and second map.So in this game, you level up by defeating bad guys which earns you a choice between new cards, action points (for attack cards), mana points (for mana), more hit points, etc.  As you open the map in a level, you will encounter monsters to defeat with your deck, captains that grant the chance to upgrade a card or gain more action points, healers to heal, campfires to heal and get bonus, monoliths that grant positve and negative perks, special npc that grant rewards, merchants to buy new cards and equipment, etc.Each card cost action points and mana points so leveling these up are important.  You have hitpoints.  Equipment grants bonuses to hitpoints, attack strength, gives new cards, percentages to get more potion drops, etc.  During combat, you can be weakend, poisoned, ignited, etc, but you can do the same to your opponents, with each card you play.  There are lots of cards with different effects, from special attacks, buffs, debuffs, magic spells, etc.You win the card match and open another part of the map.  Once you defeat the main boss in that map you progress to the next map.  After three maps, you meet the main boss, who has  lots of hit points, great cards, and a beeotch to defeat.  I still have not defeated him and I am not giving up either.I'm rambling.  My advice, if this seems interesting watch a youtube review to get more info as it is better to watch  a video then listen to me rambleHaving lots of fun.  My advice is buy it and add it to your steam library."

A great card rogue like game, which needs brawn as well as brains, and you will come back for more and more.  It will annoy the hell out of you, but you will enjoy every second of it doing so.  If it was a drug, it should be banned, as once you start, you wont want to stop.  Superb stuff!  Cant rate it highly enough, and wish there was more games like this today."
,Recommended,496620,30966536,Posted: 5 April,all,Cap10I,"In Monster slayers you pick a hero class, each with a unique set of cards, which you can use to destroy enemies in a turn based fashion.You will die a lot but with each run you will get some new gear and some fame to buy some perks to help you along a little further on your next run in true rogue like fashion.And despite the fact that the game is well executed, stable and fun to look at it simply falls short of what it could have been or at the very least hopefully will be.The companion system is flat giving you a limited set of abilities that you don't really get to utilize a lot due to the fact that you can only use them every few battles. This means that the companions are really not participating and just sit there watching you get hit in the face.Hero characters are really dependant on available starting cards which quickly settles you on one or two characters to play until you build up a decent set of gear and abilities to make other characters playable.Some of the enemies can literally clear your hand leaving you with a single card to play the next turn which occasionally can repeat for several turns (spiders are especially guilty of this) where others really depend on whether you got lucky with the cards you found along the way if you can even crack them.And whilst those are relatively small drawbacks the biggest downfall for me is the lacking depth of the deck building aspects. There is no real way to pre-build decks before getting started which only allows to modify your starting cards a little through fame-bought abilities. Rather than collecting cards and being able to use them in your deck on the next run you have what you have to start with meaning you get forced down specific card selection paths to be efficient.The amount of combo's is limited resulting in a lot of playstyles focussed either around the far superior draw decks (play cards that draw more cards) or the 'a lot' more challenging sustain decks (block and whittle the enemy down). This really puts the whole game in favor of the rogue class which is fun for a while but gets old quick. Just the ability to play with the decks a little more, maybe have an off-hand deck so you can work towards a certain combo set without having the cards 'pollute' your current hand and drawing out the game a little more could work wonders here.All in all most people won't make it past the 20 hour game time mark simply because the game has little more content to offer beyond the base mechanic. Most characters will simply fare so much worse than the rogue really forcing you to either dig in for achievements sake or just move on.I'll give this a thumbs up because I don't really mind the game's simplicity and I see hope in the eagerness of the developer but in truth this game strikes me as a great game to play while you are waiting for a bus or a casual round here and there rather than sitting down for any serious stretch of time to play.7/10 Great if you love rogue's, will bring you closer to committing suicide if you love rangers. Lacks the depth and content to truy be great."

If you have played dreamquest - this is excellent if you want more. I would characterize this game as being twice the complexity for 10% more depth. That sounds like a backhanded compliment, but that is a really good deal for some people and not for others.Some players are miffed at how close it is in many places to dreamquest, but for me - you shouldn't redesign the wheel, and Peter Whalen created an excellent wheel - and you should credit your inspirations, which they have in many places."
76561198009823849,Recommended,496620,31559265,Posted: 5 May,all,Celtia,"EDIT: Literally 12 hours after I posted this review, an expansion came out for the game, quickly supporting the hope for future content updates and more to experience.For now, the game is a little limited in content. The normal mode I managed to finish in roughly 3 hours (albeit with only 1 of the rather distinct 8 starting classes, which further unlocks one of the additional 8 unlockable classes), but the core gameplay loop is phenomenal.For the aesthetic; solid animation quality. For the Rogue-Lite; plenty of cross-run progression. For the card game; sufficient depth to enable a series of strategies, from burning through your deck rapidly to exploit ""X cards played this turn"" effects, to building mana for devastating spells, to defensive 'wear your opponent down over time' strategies, and more.If you've ever played Cards of Cthulu - this is just that game, only dozens of times better. More to do, more strategy, more card game, more rogue-lite.My only real complaints are as follows:-Forgettable Soundtrack-Classes don't seem perfectly balanced. At least, the Assassin class I unlocked feels pretty mediocre, whereas the Rogue felt awe-inspiringly powerful with the right cards.-Could use a little more content. More enemies, more areas to fight, more classes, alternative or extended progression.I'd love to see this game get more content updates, even an expansion. Great concept, well executed!"
,Recommended,496620,30743006,Posted: 25 March,all,Leeabe,"Very fun addicting game, which I find myself playing every time I have some gaming time. Thanks to the steady stream of new unlocks, there is a nice sense of progression in the game. As each time you lose, the skills you unlock, along with improved equipment, ensures that you make it a little farther the next time. Still, you do have to be careful with your deckbuilding, there are tons of hard decisions (do I improve a card or take a new powerful card?) and it does takes a little bit of luck at times.Graphics are acceptable and the voice work is very good (although it can get old at times). The games play out fast, but a full game will probably take around an 45 minutes to one hour once you get a bit more powerful. I haven’t found any bugs in the game myself.If you like roguelike deck building type games, this is a great buy, especially for the money."
76561198142311722,Recommended,496620,30988623,Posted: 6 April,all,sush1monster,"Really fun game with great style, concept and pace. Definitely recommended, although it has rough edges.The game allows you to play very quickly, which can feel quite satisfying once you get the hang of it.It's a procedural rogue-like so some runs give you the dream sequence, others a quick death - but the fame system creates overall progression through a choice of unlocks that affect all future playthroughs. Also items gained in a run are stored in a persistent chest that you can access with each new character before and between dungeon selections.So about the rough edges...A lot of things aren't explained well/at all, which is generally fine but still creates a few annoyances. For example, the first time you recruit a new support character you get to name them but the game doesn't tell you this name becomes permanant for all future runs.If there is a way to pause an enemy turn to examine cards, etc. I haven't found it, which has definitely handicapped my learning process as cards are played quickly and dicarded out of sight after the turn with no way to play back or review what happened. The most confusing situation is having your turn inexplicably interrupted and the enemy turn immediately starting (I leared eventually this was from a card held by the opponent called ""Enough!"").A lot of information is just generally unavailable:You can't see your character's total HP/AP/MP, summary of equipment effects, or current companions on the map screen as far as I know.You can't see what fame upgrades are currently affecting your character either on the upgrade screen or the map screen.You can't see what temporary cards may be in your deck due to equipment (maybe give these a special border orsomething?).You can't easily see what additional affects from upgrades or equipment may result from playing a card (i.e. a helmet giving card draw from playing a specific card).There is no card glossary or beastiary which would be very nice features for the cards and creatures you've encountred so far."

You have a choice of six characters from minute one and many paths on the skill trees. As for the gameplay, it's a card game with slowly changing decks that always reset back to their original form at the beginning of every run (unless changed on the skill tree). I can see it getting boring after awhile to play the same deck over and over, but that's why there are classes. I managed to beat the first boss, and I'll be playing quite a bit longer. Not much holds my attention for very long, but I feel this will."

76561197987014920,Recommended,496620,33365581,Posted: 7 July,all,Manxome,"Weak recommendation.  This essentially copies Dream Quest--not just concepts, but many specific abilities and cards--but Dream Quest is a good game to copy.  I feel Monster Slayers does some stuff better but other stuff worse.UI: Prettier but less functional.Monster Slayers employed an actual artist! But Dream Quest does a great job of making info on keywords, stats, cooldowns, etc. all available when you want it, while Monster Slayers does a pretty poor job of this.More emphasis on grind.Both games require you to spend several runs unlocking advantages before you have a serious shot at winning, but Dream Quest's are achievement-based, whereas Monster Hunter focuses more on just playing a long time.  Monster Hunter also seems to have more vertical power growth, which made the first dungeon of future runs start to feel trivial after only a few runs.  And when you beat Monster Hunter, you lose the items you used to do it, so it requires ongoing grinding to replace them (whereas in Dream Quest, once everything is unlocked, it's unlocked).Earlier diversity.Dream Quest classes grow differently but start pretty similar.  Monster Hunters classes seem to start with more differences and acquire unique cards faster.  Also, Monster Hunters has several cards that can be used in multiple ways.Easier.Some days, I felt like I had to make 5 runs on Dream Quest before one of them got good enough card options to make a viable deck.  Monster Hunters seems more consistent and overall easier.  (Note:  This may not be apples-to-apples, since I started playing Dream Quest before they added easier difficulty settings, and I have not unlocked Monster Slayer's ""legendary mode"".)Balance seems more erratic.Just a gut feel, but Dream Quest strikes me as more finely-tuned, whereas Monster Slayers feels like it lets you get into degenerate cases (such as playing your whole deck every turn, or killing the final boss in one round) more easily and with greater impact.(Note:  I played Dream Quest on iOS, and most of my play with it was a long time ago.)"

Infact the less deck you have the better.  You just want the same good cards over and over.  No real interactions going on.  And most deaths you can't do anything about.  I'm fine with dying alot but I kinda wanna feel like I deserved it by making a wrong play, being greedy, lack of knowledge, missing something, poor tactics, or something like that.  With monster slayers you'll find yourself saying ""I couldn't have done anything different and lived""  They should just give you a kill yourself option so atleast it feels like you got a choice."

From the other reviews I am sure you have a good idea of what game this is, but I am here to talk about the depth of the gameplay.  I know for a lot of card game fans and rogue-like gamers out there this is important.The game can seem to get boring after you find yourself discovering everything.  After you seen the cards, beat the boss, played the rogue class, farmed some items, maxed out talents, etc.  But, you haven't tried legendary mode.  This is where the real game begins.Legendary mode is much much harder than normal.  It is still relatively easy if you are playing rogue or wizard with card draw on mana charge (those two are just very fine tuned class).  But if you try to beat legendary on any other class I would say it takes some commitment and stratgizing.  You will have to maxmize the full heal you get on every level up.  You will have to pick a choose fights carefully.  It becomes a game of efficiency.  You will start to remember which enemies have which cards.  A nice part of the game is that you have one deck.  The enemies have tons of different deck.  Means are pitched against a dozens of different playstyles with one playstyle that you tune and adjust.  This leads to optimization and dealing with counters.  Any realisitc deck that you can obtain there is ALWAYS a counter deck to it (a little rng factor too to spice thigns up).  You will likely to run into one of those counters, and if you are caught off guard without planning for it you are likely to lose and it's game over.Just for some examples you have enemy decks that excells as the game goes long.  Enemy priests that cloggs your decks with curses and puts perma-dots on you.  Or decks that excells as the game goes long but also if your deck is thin, like medusa which turns your cards to stone and you find your self rapidly running out of cards.  Undead knights have anti magic and combo breaking abilities, as any enemy with the ""Enough"" card (end the turn if six or more card is played) shuts out combo decks and decks that cycles through.  Enemy mages and rogues are deadly if you don't have the means to handle the bursts.  Enemy rangers that are guarenteeed to go first meaning you will take a good chunk of damage.  Enemies that just cancles your cards and tickle you down slowly.  Enemies that utilizies poision that if enough will kill cycling decks.  Enemies that doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ how much defense you have and just blow you away with damages and are backed up with their own high health and stats.  Merceanaries (mirror deck of yours) that may forces a stalled match if your deck outheals the damage it can potentially do.  And the harbinger that you have to plan your whole end game around.You have to deal with all these things with the gears you equip, the gold you find, and the deck you build.  It is a changllenging task, but a fun one.  I currently have only 6/12 classes to have beated the legendary mode.  I am placed currently 4th in the world in terms of total fame and I think my hours reflect as well as legimitizes my assesment of the gameplay on the difficulty it is IMO meant to played at.  So if you are worried that this game wanes out or gets too easy, I assure you that will not be an issue."

Strategies start to become clear the more a specific character is played, allowing you to efficiently build a winning deck.Speaking of strategy, there are a variety of enemy types with their own play style, some are fast chain hitters, counter-attackers, life leechers, and some mimic your exact deck! Monster Slayers keeps you on your toes and constantly tests your deck, but don't worry, the game gives you plenty of opportunities to tweak it.Collecting cards to build a winning deck each run is fun, addictive, and super-rewarding.

First and last game ill probably ever do a review for.The different playstyles and classes is absolutly glorious and caters to any playstyle if you know the class well enough. The fact that i can make numerous different kinds of Knights/Rogues/Clerics is astounding, choosing to be defensive, use more AP or toss in Mana cards and regen to make a Battlemage type character. The only issue i have is that as of now, to me, the classes are not balanced.I have easily completed the game with rogue and ranger but im having such a hard time doing it with anyone else. The monsters get hard too quickly for cleric to tank and keep up with and to a point, the barbarian just can't burst down anymore before you get slaughtered on The last dungeon. It may be just me not being so good at these decks but i think things like this will dissipate in time. For now i can just play rogue and play 30 cards in one turn or play Ranger and get constant 80% dodge and crit shots.I have high hopes that this game will develop into something that is one of a kind and a great example of what a passionate team can do especially with 6 free classes coming out is just the cherry on top.P.S. Please do multiplayer at some point."

At the time of this writing I've gotten about half the achievements and I'm not that great or terrible so I'd say a full achievement run would take between 8 - 12 hours.The game has six classes to choose from and eight companions (you can have up to two companions per run). The permadeath perk system is well thought out and rewarding. Will you spend fame points (you get them for finishing battles, zones, a run or at death) towards improving general abilities, companions or a specific class? That's totally up to you.The only gripes I have is - No exit button so once you finish a run you'll need to hit escape at the class selection screen to quit and you access gear before you entire a zone so you have to remember to gear out a newly created character with the loot from your last run or else you're basically running in naked and dang if I didn't constantly forget that because it was weird to not access inventory wherever. It's not a bad thing, makes you choose your load out, just was hard for me to get used to personally. Also inventory is limited so if nothing else make sure to sort and sell to leave space for a new shiny or two.Overall, I do recommend the game.

This game here?- a close to perfect difficulty (of course there is RNG to get good/the right cards, but if you build your deck with an idea in your mind, you should have a good chance of beating the legend bosses)- 12 mostly unique classes- good looking interface- ultimate wombo combo deck builds are possibleOne thing i dislike: if you complete a run with a class, you lose your equipped items (the hero takes it as payment). this would be ok IF there wouldn't be the legendary difficulty where you lose your items everytime you die. that's a bit too much of a grind, because the items are randomly generated (kinda based on your based class, at least that's what it looks like). I stopped using good items in the normal runs and only use them on legendary, but that's not optimal.TL;DR: Buy it if you like card games and/or rogue likes. Even if you're not a card game player - the game is worth a try. Thanks, Nerdookpeople!"

,Recommended,496620,30784297,Posted: 27 March,all,Buck Naked,"This is an excellent game. In its simplest form, it is an improvement on the roguelike/deckbuilder Dream Quest. The two games' similarity, however, is only confined to the premise and basic gameplay elements. Monster Slayers is a coherent and stylish rouge-like/lite (whatever) that is a legitimate treat to play. The gameplay is refreshing, simple, and has an excellent skill ceiling - which is driven by the player's selection of class. Rogue = OP at first (the dev nerfed it in like two days!), warrior = average, mage = hard mode. Each class receives a deck containing various starting cards (as well as future cards) and then battles their way through one of the levels. After level 3, you win!Other reviews have already gone into deeper into the mechanics, so I'll stop there. If you enjoy video games - buy this game.I've had a steam account for over 13 years, and this is the only review that I've felt compelled to write (or, that I can remember feeling the need to review - I'm pretty baked)"

The Rogue, for example, has cards that deal a bit of damage and draw another card, and their late-game cards synergise with this strategy. The Cleric, on the other hand, has spells that gain armour, health, and deal damage-over-time.The game is a bit short overall but it definitely has replay value, which is what you want from a roguelike."

Now that I have qualified myself to write a review let's get into it.I have never really enjoyed rogue-like games that much but this is an exception that has stolen my heart once I got the hang of things. If you like stragegy turn based card games with some saucy rng mixed in with rpg qualities then buy this game. buy it now.At first I was upset when I died right away, but quickly figured out I had to gain a little traction by getting some skill points assigned to the right spots (I don't want to talk about how many heros i've buried. haha). Little by little I was able to get further and further until I finally beat The Harbinger for the first time.

Pick one of 6 classes, navigate from room to room via map Darkest Dungeon style, fight baddies, win new cards, upgrade others or remove them from your deck, find loot, etc.And just when you think you are unstoppable, get annihilated and start again. Brutally challenging, quick to play, hard to put down.Each run will earn you fame, which unlocks upgrades and passives that affect starting hit points, change out cards in starter decks for each class, give companion NPCs new abilities and passives, add new cards to loot tables, and more. You also get to keep gear you find and use it on your next character, which also helps to make you more powerful over time.It's delightfully fun, even when getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you.I can't wait to play more, but my play sessions are usually fairly short for various reasons. But you can get in and run a dungeon pretty quickly once you get the hang of it. And the developer even added mid-dungeon saves if real life calls you away."

If you think that it is an indie game and the price is so low... a must buy for me. Amazing work!At first you will die a lot. But when you unlock all the generic things that buff all the classes, all it takes is a couple of runs to unlock all cards and abilities for each class. Probably getting the final boss kill even before that, with some luck. At the moment I have finished the game with all the basic classes. And it was really fun. Some of them rely on equipment abilities a lot some don't. RNG is there, but you feel like you have the control. Never getting too lucky/unlucky.The classes, after you unlock everything they feel really different, and each has a theme. But so far there is not much variation inside the scope of a class. Some cards are a must, and there is small variety on the deck choices. And some people may think that the classes feel the same. This is beacause the action/draw mechanics on these games tend to overshadow the deck flavor. Especially at the beggining, when you don't have every card unlocked for the class. The best decks are the ones that can cycle the whole deck list in a single turn. And to do that you have to cut cards out, add some others, upgrade the ones you keep... this is the essence of the deckbuilding games!! Refine while you play. (and to do it in a rogue like environment, wow!)Being a veteran on deckbuilding games like this, on board games mostly, Monster Slayers was quite easy so far, but fun. Really fun! I can't wait to try the legend mode... But I felt like I had to post this review even if it is too soon. I'm perfectly satisfied even as is. I could build decks again and again, couple of cards in, couple out. They look the same, but they are not... and the whole process is fun! Did I say that before?A great game! That really shines after a few hours of gameplay. So give it a try! And if you strugle at first, don't give up. I have watched so many youtubers already strugling with Monster Slayers because of their inexperience with deckbuilding games.Have fun! And sorry for the long review :)"

Rangers can be built into Sword fiends or into the classic first strike ko archers.Simiularly Rogues can chain entire decks and Barbarians are as powerful as their ablitiy to shrug.The voice acting to great expecting the standard to be equal with Hearthstone's own, though it does grow tiresome with the same voice so I advise clicking random with the hero creation so that you don't stick with a favorite from the beginning, eitherway they'll be dead soon, as there are sure to be a few lovely Darkest Dungeon moments when luck favors your foes.Three hours in v1.03"

This game is no different, it's their on take on Dream Quest, a really great IOS rpg with art that looked like it was made by a  yr old.Pros:-Dirt Cheap Price-Low system requirements (potato PCs can run this)-Nice art and presentation (lots of special effects, your character visually wears whatever weapon or armor you equip which is GREAT)-Good soundtrack and SFX (attacks have a real nice ""oomph"" sound effects)-Character progression, multiple classes and companions which add buffs-Very Addicting! When you die you immediately make a new one and it leads to the ""one more turn"" playing experience loop. I only expected to take a 5 min look at this game to see if it runs properly (have to do something else) I ended up playing for almost 2 hours straight.Cons:-Somewhat little content, I mean you will get your money's worth but you can complete a run in maybe 6 hours, 6 classes is like 36 hours total. That's well worth the pittance you spent on this game, but it's not like other roguelikes like TOME or Dungeons of Dredmore or other similar games where you can spend 100s of hours.-Name of title is really bad. ""Monster Slayers""? Sounds more like an action game like monster hunter rather than Dream Quest 2.0. It's also a really generic name, years later people might remember they once played this game but they probably won't remember the title.All in all I highly recommend this title esp. if you haven't played Dream Quest before.

As long as you have the mana and AP you will be able to spam all of your skills and spells and kill the monster without him ever having to do anything.The game was released too early and there are a lot of balance issues such as the one described above.  We're not even talking about how unfinished this game is!I understand that this is supposed to be a roguelike where there are spikes of difficulties but there's things in here that cannot be avoided and you just die.  One such example is the regeneration that Trolls get.  Regeneration just keeps stacking and stacking and the fight can literally go on for 30 or more minutes!!!  I haven't had a fight go on for 30 minutes since I had casted the summon spell ""Knights of the Round""  in Final Fantasy!!At the beginning, you're supposed to get a history of stats with each playthrough.

,Recommended,496620,30752325,Posted: 26 March,all,Aalnius,"Simple, Short, Easy but Fun roguelike, initially you'll not get very far but the extra abilities and carry over equipment ramp you up very quickly.The actual game flows pretty well.The class gameplay styles are fun and most different although a couple i feel could of been done better such as the barbarian, ranger and knight feel like they need some tweaks or different cards to make their classes flow better.There is a lot of carry over between cards so knights can pickup mage cards and vice versa.I feel like this is a good base but many of the mechanics could likely be fleshed out more.modding would be nice.There isnt an overall great amount of cards so you'll generally see the same cards repeatedly no matter what class you pick.The ui can be a bit clunky in some parts but works fine overall.The runs are really short even when you win them.Its probably worth it for the money for most people but dont come into this hoping for a fleshed out roguelike and long amount of content.its a good base and i fell like the game could benefit from flushing out the mechanics more.For context i've beaten the game with all classes and nearly got all the abilities my game time is currently 23hours but about 7-8 hours of that was whilst i was tabbed out playing dnd so real gametime is actually about 15 hours."

It's a deck building game rogue like, but what I really appreciate about it is that each run helps the next run. Your overall fame you accumualte allows you to unlock other abilities that make you stronger in your next runs and the items you collect carry over from run ro run. It is compulsively playable and easy to get into. Highly recommended!"

76561198165346532,Recommended,496620,30850289,Posted: 31 March,all,Omegron007,Honestly I can't stop playing this game....  I'm actually surprised more people aren't playing/talking about this game.I collect and play alot of board games and deck builders are among my favorites.  In this game it marries a dungeon crawl to a very competent deck building game and rogue like elements.This game is addicting and a joy to play.  I recommend it highly.
76561198003584410,Recommended,496620,30944131,Posted: 4 April,all,ezerferrefin,"The game is pretty good, it's a pretty addictive time sink that requires a bit of thinking at times.One improvement I would recommand is the monster ""mercenary"" It can almost lead to a stalemate if you are running a knight or Cleric when you go up against it. This is because the Merc uses the same deck as you. And if you build a very strong defensive/reflect damage deck, you will both be invulnerable for most of the game. Unless a good run of RNG comes up and you have the correct follower, you will be stuck there with no option but suicide to him and restart the game."

I have to say this little game has really caught my attention.The game seems like another stale card battle type game on the surface but after about 30 minutes of play you start to understand that you can start manipulating the decks by upgrading, deleting, and adding cards.  While some of this is beyond your complete control you do get some good options to change it how you want while still leaving you to think and strategize the ahead plan.To the developer, the game definitely is a great fun little game that i hope does well but a few things to help polish the game off.Improve the audios, such as if im the ranger i dont want him to attack and his audio for his attack to be taste my blade.  Should be some sort of bow reference.  Just little audio queues like that would really give the game a morewell rounded feel."
