I really enjoyed this title, and I wasn’t expecting that kind of ending at all. At first the MC annoyed me, but after a while I started to like her.It’s worth paying the full price on this one! 8/10, I highly recommend if you want to read something a bit different."

Almost nothing happens. There's one vaguely interesting twist near the end... and it takes hours of boring dialogue about nothing to get to it. Not worth it.This VN forces you to get through the whole darn story as a kinetic novel--that's right, no choices--before it unlocks the one and only choice you can make in the game. Each subsequent choice unlocks new ""plot"", so you have to suffer through more boring story again and again.I mean, you don't HAVE to. I'd paid for this VN so I felt like I should go through all the choices. I kept hoping that maybe something interesting or cool was hidden in there somewhere.It wasn't."

76561198203337561,Recommended,496630,28108693,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,vroomvroom,"I'm going to start this review off by going as far as to claim that I enjoyed this title even more than I have Key's critically acclaimed titles (CLANNAD and Planetarian). I'm not claiming this is the best story I've ever read or the greatest VN of all time, but for me it is up there.Empty Horizons is a rather short Visual Novel in the sense that you might finish it within a few hours (it took me a little bit over two to finish the first route, but I am a rather quick reader). I'd say the term kinetic novel is more fitting than visual novel, honestly, as there are two choices that you get access to after completing the game once. What I have stated may be a bit of a deterrent to those that want a choice laden or lengthy game, so I counter by saying that the game has a story that I found to be masterfully crafted and despite reading everything in nearly four hours - I skipped repeat text – I've spent far longer with the story because my brain keeps cycling through it three days later; the story has had a lasting effect on me and is one that I will likely remember for the rest of my (hopefully) long life.In addition to the story, the VN comes with the following extras: a CG Gallery, Bonus Art, a Music Box, and Notes from the author (notes that I found really insightful and enjoyable). On the subject of what the game contains, it does not contain voice acting, but I regard that as a plus because it would have cut over the game's excellent soundtrack. I wasn't a fan of the artwork in the beginning, but it quickly grew on me, so if you aren't wild about the look, maybe it'll grow on you over time?I want to leave a longer review, but I am unsure how to do so without spoiling anything and the author's description of the game says all that can really be said on it without spoiling. As an individual that loves to read nearly everything I can get my hands on, I cannot recommend Empty Horizons enough.If you are still unsure then maybe wait until the Ebi-Hime Bundle or Empty Horizons goes on sale and pick this game up either alone or with some of Ebi-Hime's other Visual Novels."
,Recommended,496630,31204257,Posted: 17 April,all,niX,"Nice VN. This is a really nice piece of work by ebi-hime, who once again delivers.The plot features a young woman, Mireille, who is faced with a difficult decision after her father dies. She's been mostly isolated her whole life, and doesn't have many friends. She has only one living relative left, her Uncle, who she is now expected to live with. The family chauffeur, Lyon, is expected to deliver Mireille to her Uncle's house.Although Lyon has known Mireille since she was young, they don't know each other that well outside of a working relationship, and Mireille claims that she despises him. Although deep down, she has mixed feelings for him -- not knowing whether this is hatred or a crush she does not want to admit. The story focuses mostly around these two, and takes off from there.ProsNice artwork including characters and backgrounds.Soothing music.The interactions between the two main characters is very enjoyable.Good choice in font color and text, making this easy to read regardless of the background.Three different endings.Full gallery, music box and a ""notes"" section where the developer talks about her personal feelings and thoughts while writing the story and the characters. I think this is a really nice additional touch to understand exactly what the writer wanted to convey.Nice card set and easy achievements.Everything is functional. Doesn't crash, start/load works well, skip button, sound features, window resolution, etc.Other ConsiderationsI really have no cons about the game. But here are some other things I thought I would mention:The first ending is shocking and sad. This isn't necessairly a con. It's actually great story telling, but I'm including it on here for people who like happy endings. Or for those who won't want to play again after a first time to get the happier endings.Sometimes scenes drag on a little bit. As with my review of ebi-hime's ""Asphyxia,"" I feel as if she goes on and on a little bit TOO much sometimes. When it's starting to feel long winded, I often want to skip or put the game down and not read it for another little while.The first time you play the game is strictly kinetic. There are no choices until your second and third playthrough. And even then, you are only offered ONE choice. This might bother some people, so I thought I'd mention it.The game is short, no matter what ending you play for. This makes it difficult to get a really fulfilling character development between the MC and the other characters. I definitely think the development is there personally, even though it's relatively short lived. I can see, however, how some people might have been expecting a bit more than just banter that goes back and forth (most of the time)."
76561198013683638,Recommended,496630,32755934,Posted: 24 June,all,FantasyKT,"I'm conflicted on whether I should recommend this or not. During my first playthrough, I was a bit bored and almost gave up. Although their banter was cute, the scenes dragged on a bit without anything really happening. The ending was interesting enough that I wanted to replay it to see the alternate endings (with the skip button). It was emotional. Overall, I think the game is worth it if you play through all of the endings, especially at its low cost."

A few, assorted thoughts in no particular order:- awesome art (I dig this style)- AMAZINGLY lovely music (if you want the music, google the names of the songs and artists b/c it's creative commons, so you can DL it for free on various Soundclouds)- interesting story. I will leave it at that at risk of ruining it or spoilers- really though, game gave me srs feelz. It has been ages since a game did that to me.- there is literally only 1 choice branch in this entire 'game' .... it is more of a kinetic novel than a choose your own adventure novel, though you really are choosing a path to some extent, but once you make the selection, you don't get to choose again. just sit back and enjoy it.- the story seemed really unbelievable in general, but I get that is the point of novels, games, etc. but maybe it was part of me going ""no way!! this can't happen!"" because the story is so cute and I had strong feelz about how it branched off.- replayability in the sense that you will want to start a new 'game' each time to see the different outcomes (or to collect the achievements) which brings me to:- yay steam achievements- yay screen shot capabilityI was sad when it ended yet it felt right at the same time. Which is good, in my book.Overall 10/10 worth the cashdollaz - on sale or not."

The character development is great and the CGs are often and beautiful. I couldn't believe the finale, it hit me hard, and the characters speak with humour and about relatable topics. I 100% recommend this.(Btw it's a kinetic vn so you don't make any choices, it's like reading a picture book - until the second and third play throughs, where you make one choice at the start. There are 2 different endings but one contains an extra after the credits and has more dialogue than previously throughout.)"

Not bad as in the writing, but... be prepared to be slightly angry. The second playthrough you get a choice. There is literally no sex between the heroine and the protagonist. Now, in order to get all the achievements, you need to play through the first time, then go through each of the choices afterwards.I'm not sure if this will be a good VN for everyone, but it is an interesting experiment, if nothing else."

The second and third endings are based on a single A or B choice.  I will readily admit the first ending caught me by surprise, I was not expecting that at all.  Also, be advised that the actual ""ending"" of the second and third endings is after the credits run.I really like the artwork.  It's very different from most of the visual novels on Steam.  The backgounds like the lakes are very nicely done.Based on this VN, I'll most likely buy other Ebi-Hime titles."

After you beat them game if you replay it there is a new choice at the beginning of the narrative that lets you pick from two alternate branches of how things could have happened.If you enjoyed Asphyxia or The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns you’ll enjoy this.If you’re looking for a VN with lots choices, heavy romance, and a happy ending, then you should look elsewhere.Sillyselly’s art is stunning as always."

No actual gameplay elements at all, no puzzles, no choices.. just a story you'll need to read because there also is no voice acting.Worth the money if you like interesting (but not great) stories.

Beautiful music, wonderful characters, amazing plot twist that took even me for a loop. As much as I wish I could say one bad thing about this visual novel, I can't. If you don't mind a bit of cursing and some adult humor along with a touching story, this is for you. Now buy this game! But I will elaborate a bit more on it, so bear with me for another paragraph if you will?I do want to warn you that this game isn't like a regular otome or visual novel. You don't get any choices until your second playthrough, so bare that in mind. Considering you do have to play it multiple times, it is easy to get all steam achievments. Along with this though, I was highly disappointed at the lack of romance, but what was I expecting from a relationship that was over a decade apart.PS. I thought the ""love interest"" was the uncle so I bought the game to check it out. It isn't the uncle, but still glad i bought the game."

This is not a VN with a fairytale ending on any of the playthroughs, though one does somewhat approach a happy place.The art borders between beautiful and lazy. The backgrounds and Mairono are both well done and nice to look at. I'm not trying to be rude to the artist when I say this but Lyon looks like he came straight ouf of a 'how to draw Manga' book.The music is varied, fits every scene, and is almost good enough that I'd want to search it up just to put it on for background noise.Would I suggest buying this? Yes. For three dollars it's a complete steal and I can't wait to try more titles from Ebi-Hime."

I read the great reviews, was attracted to the description and beautiful artwork, yet I still wasn't expecting to be so captivated. This is now, hands down, my new favorite read.- The artwork is stunning, especially the female characters--I just couldn't stop staring in awe. The CGs and backgrounds are gorgeous; granted, the interior backgrounds aren't as appealing as the outdoor backgrounds but it hardly matters. There also isn't an extensive variety of backgrounds (or other artwork for that matter), but the story carries itself enough that it still manages to mesh together masterfully with what few assets are presented.- The music is beautiful. I don't really know what else to say about that, ya get the feels and atmosphere from it and it makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.- And last but defintely not least, the writing is spot on. I'm a writer myself and I'm really impressed and inspired. This modern romance story is up to par with the classics, in my opinion. I love stories that focus heavily on dialogue, interactions, and relationship development and that's exactly what this is. And stories like that can be hard to keep people amused but I was enticed by every line. Watching their relationship unfold in a very natural and human way was beautiful and emotional. The characters and the backstory were very well fleshed out. Even those who didn't have much screentime, if any at all, I feel like I knew them well, especially Miri's feelings about them. I'm impressed by that since it's just a few hours of reading give or take.Definitely worth it. 10/10.Thank you for making this masterpiece!"

I love a good bantering between couples but they.never.stop.The heroine is a tsundere: I don't have anything against tsundere characters but if you hate them you are warned.Anyway I found her to be annoying because it's like she is searching for a fight. I appreciate when a character can give a good reply to people picking on him/her but in this case, she is often the one searching for discussions.The male character is a womanizer who jokes almost all the time. He could be nice if he didn't have so many sexist lines. Sure, it probably were made to having him jokingly picking on the heroine but I got tired very soon of this.In short, his jokes are very often about how the heroine should be more feminine in the hope of finding a rich man who would marry her. That's... boring and not stimulating in the interaction between characters.It's a pity I couldn't find the game more entertaining because the art is good: nice style and beautiful colors, especially in the backgrounds. It just needs to work a little more on expressions and it would be great!"
