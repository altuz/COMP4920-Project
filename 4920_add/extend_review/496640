76561198268222814,Not Recommended,496640,24550969,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,JegDie,Below average horror game with really annoying sound fx and weird uncomfortable controls.  The animations and graphics are incredibly low quality.I got scared a couple times but if all you're looking for is jump scares with no atmosphere I think you can do better than this.

How it hasn't been taken off the store or at least lowered price-wise, is oblivious to me.Put your money to better use on soemthing else. This game takes place in a building that would be barely big enough for one person to live, yet you're a hired security guard. There are a couple rooms and three hallways to explore. Most of the game is spent looking at a computerscreen inside of your own, much like Five Nights at Freddy's. Except this doesn't even try. At random (I believe) intervals, alarms will sound which you then have to go and turn off in order to advance. You are given no story, at all. The developers attempt to sell the game further to you by allowing you to leave messages for other players, but that ends on August 20. Ironically, I myself haven't seen any messages. So either no one has bothered to leave a message in teh developes way, or they are totally BSing the palyer base hoping to get more money.If you're looking for something to spend 8.99 USD on, find something else. This ""game"" isn't worth it."

The game has a weird little gimmick where it will only run after 11 pm local time and will stop working again and crash on startup after 7 am local time.This is clearly a PT clone (literally) with some FNAF gameplay thrown over top. It's not bad... I mean, the audio is terrible when it's terrible (footsteps suck, loud beeping alarms suck), but pretty decent once the spoops start happening. The gameplay is horrible (the player sways like a drunk while walking, and the control scheme is...weird...), but actually works in favor of generating atmosphere once the weird stuff starts happening.I was genuinely tense as the ghostie began ramping up its attack... or whatever it was doing, and when the first jumpscare happened (also, really poor quality with no animation and some screech noise), I was genuinely startled, surprised and a little spooped out. I shut the game down.I'll try it again some other night when work isn't happening early the next morning and I have time to figure it all out.So is it good? No. But did it generate atmosphere and spoops? Yes.If you're like me and ravenously devour anything remotely resembling PT, I'd recommend it when it goes on sale, for like 2-3 bucks. Everybody else, steer clear.P.S. (To the Dev): You've got a cool concept here. Maybe some different sounds and smooth out the controls, plus some animations for the death moments and ghost and this could be really cool! I enjoyed it either way, but wish it wasn't so expensive. With the lack of polish, this feels like a 2.99 game right now..."

76561198106023045,Not Recommended,496640,30458328,Posted: 11 March,all,Nemesis311,This game was at most OK:* It was too short* The arc of suspense was disputable* The shocking scenes were almost always the same* The concept is interesting thoughIt felt a bit like a haunted house in an amusement park. Sometimes you just have to wait until the wagon moves on and takes you to the next event...
,Not Recommended,496640,29679521,Posted: 3 February,all,Chris Winters,"Seems broken from the main menu onwards.Only a few phrases actually translated into english, the rest is spanish only.Very weird controls. Half of them do not work at all. No sprinting. No help.Has nothing to do with reality or being a security guard either, so it is extremely hard to imagine yourself into it.All the wine bottles in the game must have been a leading method in creating this.Not even worth a dollar."
,Not Recommended,496640,24596523,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Strange Night is the first game to be placed onto Steam by indie publisher/developer Labory, or LB for short. The game just launched on July 26, 2016, and so far it hasn't garnered much attention; on neither the review front, nor in the way of YouTube videos. It has been a while since I've dived in to a horror game, and given the current state of ""mostly positive"" reviews, I decided to indulge myself.I knew something was wrong first off when I began installing the game and the total file size showed less than 800MB. My hunch was correct, and all of the reviews stating that Strange Night is a ""Silent Hills PT clone"" are so far out into left field that they might as well keep going until they run out into traffic. The only thing that even vaguely resembles the would've-been smash hit is the fact that you're in one of three hallways for most of the duration of Strange Night; absolutely nothing else. Glad we got that out of the way, now let us move on to the meat and potatoes of the game.You're an unnamed security guard who has shown up for his 11pm - 7am shift. There's no rhyme or reason as to why you are patrolling and securing this tiny... house? building? apartment? There's not even a story. Originally, the game would just crash if you tried to open it up outside of the real world timeframe, not even so much as a splash screen that stated the game was locked until that point. The developer listened to the community, and added in the ability to proceed with playing no matter what time it is; which is a smart move, not everyone is able to stay up as late as 11pm just to play a game. For me, it's no big deal since I work overnights anyway, but it is quite an off-putting feature.There are literally only three hallways and three rooms that you will be able to adventure in to. Needless to say, the exploration space isn't very big. Now, I'm going to start describing the gameplay, stop me when you hear something that's completely familiar and unoriginal. You do your job by flicking through five monitor channels... while looking out for something spooky... you have to turn alarms off... there's a spinning chair... and a well... and a creepy girl... who kinda looks like a ghoulish version of Sinead O'Connor. If you've clued in at all by now, you'll realize that Strange Night is a semi-advanced Five Nights at Freddy's clone with some hints of The Ring. Much time is spent in front of these monitors, which in turn trigger events around the work area. Sometimes you have to go investigate them in order to make further events happen.Let's get something else straight; jumpscares are child's play, and an absolute cop-out in the horror genre. It takes no skill to make someone jump when they're least expecting something to happen, true horror... now that's an art form. Strange Night has no art form, it has no skill, it has no ambiance, it has nothing but its three or four petty little jumpscares. What's more, this game only lasts 40 minutes; even less if you know how to trigger events faster. I made it through two playthroughs in 1.4 hours. And the developer wants $9.99 CAD for this? Instantly refunded, no hesitation or question about it. Oh, and by the way, the developer is also trying to buy reviews by promising to put your ""horror phrase"" on a wall in the game if you review Strange Night.So in other words, Strange Night is a short, overpriced Five Nights at Freddy's clone with hints of The Ring and Sinead O'Conner's ghoulish twin. The game is made in Unity (the dreaded free edition), but it runs surprisingly well and I was able to get 144FPS consistently; although I do have an i7 6700k and GTX 1080, so take that with a grain of salt. I have a feeling that most of the positive reviews (aside from the one other legitimate English review) are from friends of the developer, and as time progresses this game will get a lower rating overall. Unless Strange Night sells for less than $4.99 CAD, avoid it completely and spend your money elsewhere. Refunded, I'll put this money toward something more unique.Rating:1.0/5.0- It's Bad.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

Who are we? Who is the ghost? Who hired(?) us to watch the house? What happened to create the rest of the victims?In all, the game is a good, short, horror game. But it lacks a lot of other basic things a game should have. It was, at its core, a FNAF clone that basically expected you to know what FNaF was and the basic idea of how it worked. The only PT element was... The hallway?In all, the game got me good, won't lie! And I enjoyed it. But it isn't worth the cuurret price ($9) and it's a bit less than what it sold itself to be. I'd recommend watching this one, rather than playing it yourself, and that's not something I like to say often."

Im playing for security guard and in the house where he is working that night happens a lot of scary sh*t.I could not get through to the end, because i cant play in these psychedelic games and I have no patience, when something boring with little exciting things happens. The falls in the cave and things with repeating once again from current point is quickly getting bored.I have a hunch about all these bloody things - that man is took some drugs, he has drank all alcohol in the room and we are here!If you like crazy horrors, this game is right for you, my friend!
