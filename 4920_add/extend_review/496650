,Not Recommended,496650,24566935,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,CrazyCanuck,"OverviewIt’s Russian. It’s “horror”. It’s made in Unity Personal. This is generally a hat trick of crap for a LOT of horror games. I’ll give you a minute. (Skip to after the overview if you want a video)UPDATE: After running the game for about nine hours, not a single trading card dropped. Surprising absolutely nobody, it's safe to assume even that is broken with this garbage. Strike that from the pros list.Welcome to intermission. Do do do do do do do do do do do.Yeahhhh intermission.Do do do do do do do do do. Do do do do do do do do do.Do do do do do do do do do do do. Ahhhhhh.Do do do do do do do. (Ahhhhhh) Do do do do do do do.Do do do do do do do do do do do.Still here? Alright.Antihorroris a terrible game. It seems to be humorous that pokes fun at itself, and possibly horror game tropes, but is just terrible in how it goes about that.You begin the game on a poorly animated bus as a passenger, when suddenly a picture of a bladder appears on the screen and says URINE! Turns out you need to pee. So you ask the bus driver to pull over so you can go pee in the bushes, yet there happens to be a toilet right where he drops you off. Because that’s video game logic.Anyway, something happens, the bus pops a wheelie and takes off, while rocks that appear from nowhere come crashing down, forcing you to turn around and head to the town. Because of course.It seems to be a type of Slenderman game. I found a musical score, picked it up, and it told me I collected one of seven. I then turned around and some random shadowy figure started playing the piano. My character, in obvious fashion, tells the “ragamuffin” to get out. I then found four more notes, each one also accompanied with a jump scare that wasn’t really scary. All the time, it sounds like I was being followed by a mosquito? There’s a really annoying buzz that seems to close in then back off. I found what appeared to be a motel, walked into the only lit room, my footsteps suddenly disappeared, then the game crashed.Speaking of lit rooms, the game is exceptionally dark. I understand that horror games are best played in the dark, and I love playing them in the dark, but this is just extreme. The video and screenshots on the store page are what it actually looks like. I had to crank up the brightness on my monitor. I would’ve changed the gamma in-game, but there’s no option. In fact, you can only Play and Exit. Can’t do anything else.Controls are atrocious. Often times you’ll go to enter a door, but can’t for whatever reason, so you need to jump to get through it. Same goes for stairs.I…can’t really go on much more, as I’m struggling to find anything worthwhile aboutAntihorror.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SDzreL0RQQProsCheapTrading cards(these are broken and not dropping)ConsExtremely dark, and not in an immersive wayVague gameplaySubpar graphics and sound effectsJump scares that are neither scary nor shockingMundane environmentSummaryIf this is some sort of statement, or art project that I don’t understand, then I will fully admit that I am far too stupid to “understand” it. For those more “cultural” than I, please enlighten me if so.Otherwise, no. Just don’t. This is an all around horrible game."

This game caught my interest when I saw that it had mostly positive reviews on it. Going to see what they had said out of interest I've come to the realization that they were all fact positive reviews The ""developer"" of this trash is putting in positive reviews for this♥♥♥♥♥of a game to make more money. Games like this are littered throughtout steam, game ""developer"" going out of their way to make a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game to make some easy money from by selling it for $1.99 but giving you a 15% off sale adding to a wopping $1.69 on sale. This game is worth the equivalent of playing with razor blades.  In fact I think you can have more fun with razor blades then this game. So instead of buying this game, buy razor blades."

That's the game. You can see most of the stuff I just described in the screenshots for the game if you're skeptical, but this is a joke. A distinctly unfunny one."

,Not Recommended,496650,24585395,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,Step Vibes,"Without a doubt the dumbest game I've ever played. I tried to give it some promise and chance by keeping up with whatever the hell was going on, but it was just too damn lame for me to continue. I mean, I understand that the developer(s) was going for a ""spoof"" styled game if you will, but jeez man, this ♥♥♥♥ could've had a bit more effort put into it. The buzzing sound made more sense to me than anything in the game, and even that was just pointless. I'm no video game critiquer, but I had to let whoever reads this know how bad this is. Also, it most def isn't worth the price tag. It should've been free.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s4M-jini9s"

,Not Recommended,496650,24566506,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,MAriskaDeville,"https://youtu.be/Ipvz-9FOVrULets start with the pro's - the game certainly lives up to its title of Antihorror.  In fact this game is a joke. And  no, I'm not being nasty here - its an attempt at a 'humerous paradoy' of the horror game genre.Sadly between the ugly unity assets, the lack of english audio, and the fact the game is dark as night, the joke wears thin very fast. The game just lacks the self awarness needed to pull this sort of parady off, and the 'jokes' are very much toilet humour level.So anyway, these two unity developers walk into a building - you think one of them would have seen it..."

,Not Recommended,496650,24764047,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,Cthulhu Redux,"From the trailer this game looked pretty promising, it's not. This game is another slapped together unity cash grab. The game revolves around finding 7 notes, after some of which you are treated to a low-rent jokey""pop-scare"". It's not a serious game, it's aware that it is a joke, but unfotunately that is also what the ""developer"" thinks of you the consumer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPHciJeTjOk"
,Not Recommended,496650,24892092,"Posted: 13 August, 2016",all,Sekuhara sama,I wasted 1.99 on this game. This is why they need demos for games to be released on steam. This game goes from♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in a random toliet to needing to find notes. Is there a refund option because this game is horrible and I try to find the good side of any game. 10 minutes of playing and I'm done with this pile of garbage.

At the end you can find a gameplay video about the first minutes. In the guide section is a full walkthrough from me.AntiHorror is a short little indie-comedy-horrorgame. If you like wierd humor, it is fun.Pros:- Price- It is funny- EnjoyableCons:- Lots of Unity-Assets- Game feels cheap- Game is too darkNun gehts in deutsch weiter.AntiHorror ist ein kleines Indie-Horrorspiel. Obwohl, eigentlich ist es kein Horror Spiel sondern eher Comedy. Sinn ergibt das ganze gar nicht, aber es hat doch einige wirklich gute Lacher drin. Alles ist sehr skuril und absurd. Insgesamt ist es recht kurz, man kann es unter einer Stunde durchspielen. Grafisch sieht es akzeptabel aus, ist aber sehr dunkel. Leider benutzt es viele Unity Assets, die aus anderen Games bekannt sind.. Das Spiel hat nur eine russische Sprachausgabe, aber die Texte sind englisch. Der Sound ist okay. Die Steuerung ist auch gut. Im ersten Teil des Spiels muss man 7 Notizen finden, danach gibt es auch einige kleine Rätsel zu lösen. Alles eher unkompliziert. Mir hat es Spaß gemacht, aber man muss schon den spezellen Humor mögen. Für den kleinen Preis empfehle ich es.Pro:- Witzig- Preisniveau- Macht SpaßContra:- Besteht nur aus Unity Assets- Insgesamt wirkt es sehr billig- Spiel ist sehr dunkelHier ist ein Video der ersten Minuten, einen kompletten Walkthough von mir findet ihr in den Guides:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPdiaPk8IAA"
