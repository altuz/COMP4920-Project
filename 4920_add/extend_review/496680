,Not Recommended,496680,24467192,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,Coriiander,"An extremely buggy piece of work. In fact it is so buggy, the game cannot be played as should and it's impossible to obtain more than half of the achievements. After the first game reset, which should upgrade the Hall, the Hall isn't upgraded. Sure, you can make 5 additional Walkers but when scrolling up there's no squares and options to build additional tables, workers, etc. After the reset you're still stuck as is, with a useless income multiplier. Once you have enough funds to initiate the second reset, the game does not allow you to. It just tells you ""Error"". Restarting the game, whether saved/loaded or not, just results in all Walkers losing all their upgrades, this while they are still running at the upgraded speed.The UI is geared towards touchscreen, not keyboard and mouse as is most common for desktop systems. The mouse scrollwheel doesn't work half of the time. The game does not remember any settings whatsoever. If you relaunch the game, you'll have to manually set the video and audio options once again yourself. Over and over again. Plus, as mentioned before, restarting the game just removes the Walker upgrades, whether saved/loaded or not.And what's worst: during the first hour of gameplay, the game managed to hang my PC 3 times. I have no such issue with any other game, ranging from other simple unlicensed Unity-games to AAA-blockbusters. My system is decent and up-to-date. The game's process also does have sufficient security rights.Highscores, not even an hour after release, the leaderboards were being topped with players having scores in the range of trillions. This is simply not possible and most likely the result of cheating with things provided like CheatEngine (memory/code editing, increased tickspeed, etc). In this day and age there's no excuse anymore for games being subject to such things, especially considering online syncing. Regardless, such scores shouldn't even be accepted to the leaderboards, but no attention is given to that whatsoever making the leaderboards fully useless and meaningless.All in all, a terrible piece of work. My advise to the programmer: If you have no clue what you're doing, go do something else. It's sad to know Steam has even accepted this release; so much for quality assurance."

Particularly when creating an idle clicker game (because they are fundamentallysooosimple), it is imperative to do something novel that the others don't have. You have to stand out in a saturated market. I suppose the only novel thing aboutSweatShopis the actual theme, or skin, of the game. Otherwise it's just any other idle clicker.I'm not going to refund in hopes that the iron out some bugs andmaybethings will get better, but I certainly don't recommend the game to friends."

I wasn't totally disappointed. I don't know why, but I'm embarrassed...I played at least 7 active hours all yesterday. I completed the game the first time in 6 hours, at this time you can 'reset' or ascend to the next factory; which is the exact same except you earn coins faster. I was disappointed in this for sure!You are responsible for the effective management of a small upstart business. (Sweat shop). You will have to purchase desks, platforms, sewing machines, cloth and workers; this stuff doesn't come cheap either! Aside from adding new equipment and workers your only job is to collect the clothes once the worker is ready. If you wait too long your worker will fall asleep and wait until you collect the clothes.This game really had some potential for a monotonous clicker but let me down in a couple of areas:1) When I ascended there wasn't anything new or different; just a coin bonus. I worked extremely hard for 6 hours waiting on a payout that didn't come.2) Some of the achievements don't work. I maxed out everything in the first ascension so I should have received at least a few more achievements. This immediately made me want to quit playing.3) The ""collectors"" bug out and vanish without a trace. These units are so important because they collect cloth automatically. Unfortunately, they start to disappear once you hire more collectors than you have rows of workers. This really sucks when you are trying to auto and take a break from actively clicking.Overall, I would give thumbs up if these 3 issues were fixed. At this current state I don't recommend, but I did have some fun with it!Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

I feel like there should be another message before executing that command.  Something to the effect of, ""Are you sure you want to start a new game?  All current progress will be lost.""  I'm not sure what going on with this game, but not only did it crash, Steam crashed too.  I haven't had this before.  After launching and loading an existing game, I had two of the walkers end up in the same aisle, and no matter how many other walkers I purchased, an empty aisle remained.  So I had to manually click all of those shirts to collect them.  I had spent all my money before the successful reset, so it was a long road back to $75,000 (the amount required for a 2nd reset.)  I was never able to reset a second time.  The message on the screen kept saying Error1.  There were instances when I had to click other places on the screen before I was permitted to make my purchase.  I tried that.  I tried reloading the game, and I still counld not get the reset to work.  I had the proper amount of money.  The button was lit up. This game needs some work.  It's definitely not worth a dollar.  Like other reviewers mentioned, there are much better free games out there."

It seemed to be a more dark toned theme for such type of game.You are to run a sweatshop, make some shirts, control the work environment of your measly peasants as they slave away for your personal profit.On the other hand, the game is currently broken.  Like.  All of it.I don't mean one or two particular things, I really mean all of it.  You will be lucky if your save game file survives the night (Hint: It will be devoured.)  The most prominent issue with the game, is that when it crashes, it will very likely take the Steam client with it.Yeah.  That is one serious bug there.  No other game I have played has ever managed to take Steam out with it when it crashed.There are also many, many...many minor bugs, as well as serious game breaking bugs, all documented on the forums and other reviews.  And not much news on progress of any fixing, which the devs say they are working on.  So there may still be hope.If you like clickers, and are interested in the theme, keep an eye on it, but until these major bugs are dealt with, you may want to pass for now."

,Not Recommended,496680,24991136,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,HotcakeNinja,"I thought to myself ""It's a clicker game for only a dollar."" but I was wrong.It starts you out with a minimalistic UI that is not only unintuitive, but open to interpretation, as there is nothing to say what is and what isn't a button or what said buttons do other than a cryptic one word description like 'material' and pricetag--much like being thrown into a job that you know nothing about, but have accepted out of desperation.Once you grasp the basic concept through trial and error and discover that half of the screen scrolls with your mouse wheel, while the other you have to click and drag, still confused by 'max 5/10' which means seemingly nothing, you ever so slowly inch your way up to 20 workers and begin furiously clicking away. With the imitation of success, you look at your funds, but find that your income doesn't seem to actually increase any faster than when you had one worker. In fact, it might be increasing slower. This accurately reflects the hourly job model where more work does not equal more pay.""This game makes snails look turbocharged,"" I joked to my wife who had aged 20 years in the time it took me to purchase sewing machines for 10 of my workers. I wanted to see this game through to the end so I could write a fuller, more complete review, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I may have encompassed the entirety of it though. Tell me if I'm wrong.I was wrong, this isn't a game, it's an ironic satire on the idea of running a sweatshop wherein you slowly realize that *you're* the underpaid sweatshop worker, and that you are now minus one dollar, and 8 hours. Just like when you spend more on food in a day than you make at your job."

,Not Recommended,496680,24747893,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,dubesor,"this game is terrible even as a 1 dollar clicker game. First of all the game is buggy as hell. I barely played an hour, if that and already encountered 2 gamebreaking bugs (after the patch where dev claimed he -quote: 'fixed all bugs'-. Secondly, nothing in this game has tooltips. You are buying and upgrading things without knowing what they do. Some upgrades are actually downgrades. I bought expensive sewing machines for some of my guys thinking it would improve their output (again: no tooltips anywhere) but to my surprise they performed WORSE after 'upgrading' them (my non 'upgraded' guy would produce 5 shirts in the time my 'upgraded' guys produce 3). The music is a monotonous short obnoxious loop. Trying to buy new stuff I constantly only get a big [ERROR] message on the screen. Not actually a message that tells my WHY I can't do certain things. There are leaderboards in the game which obviously consists of only hackers (people with 99999999999 scores etc). Overall this game seems like a first project from an amateur scriptkiddie. It seems like a very first early alpha build of something someone put together in 3 days to test their newly learned coding. There are plenty of incremental/clicker games out there which are polished, and free to boot! Refunding now despite it only being a buck out of principle. Avoid this garbage."

I expected some humor about (mostly) asian sweatshops combined with a simple click manager. The result was far from it. There are so many different bugs:-Reset not actually upgrading the hall-walkers suddenly speeding of screen when loading up a game, being lost in the process-the price of upgrades resetting because the game doesn't recognise them anymore. This also locks out any full upgrades achievements in there.-the game closing down for no apparent reason.and the list goes on.Besides the bugs there are a couple of other problems it has.there is almost no information at all. the upgrades tell you nothing about what they actually do. and if you get an error you have no idea what the problem is.Even the dark humor that I would have enjoyed is no where to be found.even with the discount it's definitely not worth it.I recommend everybody to stay away from it.

I like to have something going on the side if I am watching a familiar movie. Anyway....after all the negative reviews lately I decided to write my own. Yes this game lacks any kind of instruction, it is trial and error until you get the hang of it at the beginning. I found that frustrating and almost said screw it and closed out the game. However I am now glad I didn't. I have discovered it is actually just what I expected out of a ""casual clicker"" game. Once you build up your desks and employees the upgrades are important to sucess. Then the walkers are a must and no these are not the walking dead, but handly little guys that collect product for you. The upgrade max, upgrades your finished prodoct stack size, which can become important the more 2nd workers you have at each table because it gives the walkers more time to get there. If your table is full of product your workers just sleep until it is emptied again. I have seen comments about the music, it is 1930s era with no option to turn just the music down so if it bugs you just turn down the in game volume. I usually have a video going when I play casual games like this so I never really hear the sound, but I did listen all the way through the loop a few times. How often do you really hear music styled from so long ago. If you are looking for fast action paced fun look elsewhere, but if you want a casual clicker this one is well worth the small .99 cents if you play longer than 5 minutes."

Overall, show how upgrades actually affect gameplay. Right now there's no information on upgrades.Music is still within the Sound slider. Music should have a separate slider.Loading saved games is still bugged. Workers you placed down are no longer there (along with money) but the timer saves (ha?). To top it off it might not even load your save game at all (white loading screen). It appears as if everything resets except the timer.Steam is still not integrated within the game. It should require that you need Steam running (and not have another SweatShop process running), but you can start as many processes of SweatShop as you want. You can even take SweatShop from the Steam folder and distribute the game to anyone without them paying for it OR need Steam.What I've seen so far that has been fixed or updated - I didn't go through everythingSaving now works,  barely.I cannot recommend this game until some of these major bugs are addressed.No updates in two months. Last time they updated, it took two months to only do a couple things to the game and that isn't acceptable. I feel like they aren't going to do much to this game at this point.StartOnce inside a new game it will prompt you with ""Tutorial"" and objectives (""goals""). There's nothing tutorial-like related to it showing ""Tutorial"" and giving you quest-like objectives to do. So overall there's no real tutorial that explains what to do, what specific upgrades do or how to do anything - you have to learn on your own. Nowadays it won't work like that because the average player is pretty lazy and spoon-fed, but on the other hand a game without a tutorial is not acceptable honestly - but it doesn't make the game unplayable at all.You will then click a square and on the right side ""Desk"" will light up (if enough money). Once ""Desk"" is clicked it will spawn a desk and if you click on the square with a desk on it ""Worker"" will highlight (if enough money). Worker will then start to make sweaters. From there it is a life long journey to the end.ProsSteam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. Makes this an ideal game to farm achievements on for those avid achievement farmers, and you can make a few cents in the market selling SweatShop trading cards or craft badges.Great Clicker concept: SweatShop - Who would've known to do that? I guess these people.Not hard to get in to, but it needs an actual tutorial.ConsGame is very playable, but what can potentially make it unplayable is loading not working properly.No ""Main Menu"" button during gameplay. You have to exit the entire game to go back to the main menu.No multiple save slots so you don't overwrite existing savesLoading saved games is still bugged. Workers you placed down are no longer there (along with money) but the timer saves (ha?). To top it off it might not even load your save game at all (white loading screen). It appears as if everything resets except the timer.No real tutorial. You are prompt with ""Tutorial"" and then a few objectives on what you do but there's no real tutorial. A tutorial I'm referring to is a system that tells the player how to start, for example: ""Click on a square"" now an arrow will point to the top right at ""Desk"" and it will say ""Click Desk"", ""Desks will allow you to place workers on"". Lastly, click on your Desk and then click ""Worker"" on the right, ""Workers earn you money."" - That's one example of a tutorial that this game should have. A game like this needs an elaborate tutorial in my opinion. That part should've been thought through instead of rushed to release.You can't achieve some achievementsMusic volume is integrated with sound volume so when you turn the music down you'll also turn the sound down. Music should ALWAYS have a different volume slider from game sounds.No tooltip that shows what upgrades do or any of the right side scroll options do.Clicking the bonus animal (what is it? A rat?) sometimes works in one click or you have to constantly click to get the bonus or work hard to get it. How does that work exactly? Do you have to click it in a certain spot? Does it have health and you have to click it multiple times to finally get the bonus? Not a big deal but it is confusing.Issues that I see(These are my self issues that I see within the game - I'm not at all saying this game is unplayable because it is playable.)The game doesn't have Steam integrated. For example when you try to run two instances of the same game it will tell you, ""This app is already running"". In this case you can run as many SweatShop processes you want. I just tested without having Steam on and launched the game outside of the Steam directory, it worked. Normally it will error and tell you, you need Steam running, but that's not the case. Since Steam isn't integrated within SweatShop it makes the sale price for this game really pointless. It might as well be free. 1 person can buy the game and distribute it to anybody they want for no cost. You cannot put steam_api.dll in the game folder and expect to have Steam integrated. You have to actually code it.Your ""MONEY"" value appears to be an integer and not a double or float like Items you purchase on the right, for example ""Desk"" price is a double/float value. Not a big issue but it is noticable if you are a programmer.TIME really seems pointless. Is it really for how long you've had the game running for to brag about it if it is a big value? I don't see a point in it and it is a waste of space. If you do keep it use Timespan or some type of real clock value instead of printing out total seconds. The timer doesn't even start when you start playing a new game or saved game either, it starts/ticks once you open the game and have it running.As a game developer myself I might see more than your usual player, and I did. Truely the only thing you could Not Recommend SweatShop for is the save not currently working. Other than that it is not a bad game. A tutorial, game tooltips and more information in the game to help the player is all that's heavily needed.Rating: 4/10Not Recommended. I will update this review accordingly."

However, the bugs in this game are preventing me from completing it so you get a review early.The developers did fix the issue after your first reset that just gave you a big empty add-on space (not usuable at all).  They are paying attention, but havent gotten around to everything.  Currently, I have 40/40 maxed with everything and can not reset (ERROR).  Ok, I will knock out the money achievements while I wait for this to be fixed.  I even have 30 walkers (not that I can see 30?...or should need 30), but they start to drift towards the upper rows everytime I reopen the game (another bug, yay!)  So, lets knock out the pro/con:+No sound track, runs quietly in the background while you work on something else+Simple to pick up+No excess dialogue, because there is none!+Child friendly (I have 3 and don't have to pause, turn the volume down, or cover the screen for any reasons)+Easy on the eyes, literally.

Yes the game is simple, yes the graphics aren't that great (I don't care really), yes the game isn't worth the money. I'm just waiting for them to take this game off of steam just like starforge devs did for their game.If you have to push a few buttons to get all achievements besides fixing the game...I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be considered a viable game to purchase on steam. For me I haven't gotten any horrid bugs out of the game as it works just fine. The devs themselves even said they aren't able to fix any bugs they have in the game. I am rather unimpressed at the shoddy craftsmanship that is this game.Call me rude or overly-offended, but this is just my own opinion and you don't have to like it, be that as it may, I'm sticking to this opinion of mine. This game is neither worth the time or money.I'm unable to get a refund, but at least I took this game out of my steam game list for good. I doubt the devs will fix anything at this point or ever if we're even worth it."

I sincerely hope this game keeps getting bad reviews until the developer takes notice and fixes these glaring issues, because the positive rating it currently holds is wildly misleading and this game COULD be great...First off, and most importantly,  the save feature is broken, so after you dump 2-4 hrs or more of your time into playing this and decide to take a break, you're screwed, but don't worry because the time counter works fine, so it will let you know exactly how much of your precious life you've wasted with this. It either doesnt save and starts you over from the begining, or when you reload your saved game, it breaks the game and just loads a blank white screen. Unnacceptable. In additon to that deal breaking bug, i noticed, in my experience at least, The platform and material ""upgrades"" are purely cosmetic, meaning you are wasting huge tracks of time to save up for these way overpriced, in game upgrades that do nothing to help further your progress as they should. Theres no kind of leveling system. once you max out your workers, you just keep making the same amount of money, while the upgrades get more and more expensive effectively making you wast even MORE time. The only thing these upgrades do is unlock more upgrades, which i have to assume are just as useless. 2/10 will not play again until it gets fixed."

Now at start that sounds decent, and like it could be abused. The problem is, it uses the pricing of the items to give acheivments, not the number of said items you have.Another save and load glitch i encountered was when i loaded back into my game, one of my walkers walked in a diagonal line off the screen, never to return. And buying a ""6th"" walker to try and replace him did absolutely nothing.Something else that makes this game not recommended for me is that, every time i get a trading card for the game, it crashes my game, which isnt the first time ive had a problem with a game doing that. the real problem is that it crashes my steam client.

It is a simple farming game, but instead of farming fruit from trees you are farming t-shirts from underpaid and overworked shop laborers.The look and animation is dark minimalist voxel aesthetics -- like a claustrophobic Crossy Road or a depressed Minecraft.SweatShop is a game about grind itself, so if thinking about how grind works in gaming is interesting to you, you might ""enjoy"" this game.It is not a self-reflexive piece about game grind *in* gaming, however -- unlike for example Sophie Houlden's The Linear RPG. Instead, it is about how gaming grind reflects on and is part of grind in the world. This recalls parodies like Ian Bogost's Cow Clicker, or perhaps even moreso Disaffected! (the Kinkos copy center game). The best comparison of all is probably to the works of Molleindustria that are focused on labor exploitation and economic injustice, and often cast the player in the role of management: games like Tuboflex, Tamatipico, and especially To Build A Better Mousetrap and Phone Story.-----NB: Some people experience crashing problems with this game that the developer is unable to resolve -- it may not run for you!"
