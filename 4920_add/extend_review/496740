Lots of kudos to the developer for producing a remarkable 'tour de force' of our solar system.The graphics are first class and, combined with the work that has gone into producing the tours, it truly provides an astoundingly immersive and beautiful experience.  The addition of procedurally generated planetary topography, some modelled actual features and atmospheric transitions really adds to the experience along with the 'fly it yourself' option!  The dialog for the tours is nicely done too and informative.  The comet tour was astonishing, thank you so much!The optimization is good too, I am able to run it at 2.0x super sampled resolution whilst still retaining the full 90fps on my 1080 card.  Using a base  Steam VR super sampled setting of 2.0x  I'm able to up it to 2.2x in the app with a good 80+ fps and amazing detail and clarity, any higher and I run into memory issues.  I run with just asynchronous reprojection enabled.I have experienced some issues with the settings menu where selecting the desired settings can be difficult at times but I'm sure this will be improved given time.All in all highly recommended to anyone with an interest in space and its virtual exploration."

No one could dislike this if you even like the thought of touring the solar system. The canopy, freezes up in planet shadow, you see your breath in the cabin, it's exhilarating!This is what VR is for for me, being inside the documentary. I actually feel like I am flying and feel Gs at times.To the devs: YOU MAKE CONTENT, I BUY CONTENT!I want more mach schnell. 10/10 I love science!!Last thing this is without a doubt the best $10 I've spent on VR. Haven't even explored freeflight much yet."

76561198034908334,Recommended,496740,30472637,Posted: 12 March,all,Phonetix,Wow. This is quite an experience. It's a subject I love anyway but the whole thing has been put together very well indeed.I'd recommend pulling up a cosy chair and enjoying each of the tours one after the other. It's surprisingly relaxing.Now that I've finished the tours I'm free-flying through space and visiting the sites again without the guide. I'm trying to figure out how to switch the green overlay off from the planet/satellite surfaces which is interfering with the surface landscapes....

It is visually gorgeous, informative, and really thoughtfully implemented. When I was a kid I imagined touring the solar system, and this fulfills that dream. As another reviewer said, this game obviously is a labor of love. Well worth the investment in my view."

,Recommended,496740,31569365,Posted: 5 May,all,VikingWolf,"WOW.if you have a VR and even have a fleeting interest in space. this is a must, being able to check out the solar system is incredible,  i have yet to feel a sense of wonder from a VR game that this has given me from the first 30 seconds of launching a tour. free flight is even better, just dropping into the atmosphere of a planet and skimming over the surface. this is about as close as i will ever get to being an astronaut and it is so worth it. oh, comets are terryifying up close."

76561198351487105,Recommended,496740,32998944,Posted: 29 June,all,sicklikecaptainkirk,I landed on Europa last night and watched a Jupiter-rise. Isn't this the very heart of space travel? This experience rises above the arcade or RPG. The devs fugured out an aspect that is missing from all of the Star Trek games out there. To explore. A true VR experience.Please expand this experience to other worlds within the realm of  science and education.Well done.

,Recommended,496740,33216040,Posted: 3 July,all,Control,"Very enjoyable game that really captures what VR is capable of. The tours are a great way to engage people who want to experience the wonder of VR without having to perform controller gameplay, while conversely, the free flight is very fun for those who want to be more interactive."

76561198092659634,Recommended,496740,32756847,Posted: 24 June,all,Doomsday Clock,This VR experience is the good stuff. Nicely polished and has some pretty immersive effects like seeing your breath when it gets cold. My only complaint is that i didn't buy this sooner.
76561198017105236,Recommended,496740,30458471,Posted: 11 March,all,motofox,"very nice for the money, if you like space then you want this, i found a few bugs like after a tour, the free flight option and options menu disapears."
,Recommended,496740,30500952,Posted: 13 March,all,IronPanda,"well done guide to the solar system. The obvious comparison is to the slightly cheaper Titans of Space 2.0 which does a better job of conveying the awesome scale of stars and planets but is pretty much a guided tour. This gives you the option to either go along for the ride or take control.Pros:- Good gfx, particularly the internals of the 2 ships you can pilot. Nice touches like being able to see your breath (like in Onward) and the moments when the light of the sun catches your canopy are magic.- being able to enter the atmosphere of planets. the terrain i checked looked the same but I haven't seem every planet and vids indicate there's variety.  The control system is responsive enough to fly through canyons.- Controls are great. Never used the controller as a virtual joystick like that and after a while didn't miss not having a HOTAS.Cons:- Menus look amateurish and are a mix of gaze and pointer selection. The tiny visual that explains the ship controls is just about illegible. This is the sort of thing i'd want to demo to new users so the lack of any sort of tutorial is frustrating.8.5 / 10    Different enough to Titans to warrant owning both if you love space. Cruise the solar system in your own spaceship for the cost of a cheap lunch."

I particularly liked the comet visit. Well worth the money. Haven't tried the free flight yet, but am already very  happy I bought this. The kind of experience you couldn't get outside of VR"
,Recommended,496740,30750400,Posted: 26 March,all,CyCanic,Superior quality based on real materials. Absolutely the best VR for astronomy.
76561198051626381,Recommended,496740,30455451,Posted: 11 March,all,cybermynd,"Ok, gotta say that this is pretty awesome. Just a no pressure space exploration experience. Love the narration and the tours as well. Very educational with some interesting facts about the planets and other objects. It uses a text to speech engine that also allows you to play with the script files if you want to. I doubt if the devs would appreciate it but it adds to the fun and as long as you can restore the original files, why not?I modified one of the tour narrations to include little known 'facts' about the cheesy origins of the moon...😜"

,Not Recommended,496740,30481187,Posted: 12 March,all,▽￣￣￣SILVERS￣￣￣▽,"I have a nice HOTAS set up.This game doesn't care about my HOTAS set up.This game has no control options to assign controls for my HOTAS.The pilot is left handed. There are no options to switch to right to maximize immersion. (This is more important if there was HOTAS support to be honest)With a look and click interface this game was designed for phones.Im sure it's a nice experience for those who bought expensive VR sets that want that ""Cell Phone VR experience""There is no reset veiw button. If there is I can't find it because there are no control options to find which button resets your view. Probably because they assumed you are using a phone.It would have been a good flying experience when demoing the Vive for my guests. But when they see the HOTAS set up and I hand them an xBox controller the response is ""meh"" in comparison to the other VR FLYING games on Steam that support HOTAS.I know you think I'm being harsh for a game that is $10. But I would have paid $15 for HOTAS support. VR begs for full immersion. I'm no dev so mabey adding options and support for popular HOTAS peripherals costs Thousands of dollars to implement."

76561198400044338,Recommended,496740,34239423,Posted: 14 August,all,ravivottery,Very informative. Astronomically accurate. Proportions and sizes of planets and moons  are well maintained. A must have VR experience. A dream come true for amateur astronomers.Very good orbiting tours of even the moons of the planets. You can stand on top of the spaceship for a real scary lonely tour of the outer space.
,Recommended,496740,35044668,Posted: 18 September,all,5Andysalive,"It's amazing but there isn't too much content yet. In other words it's a typical ""VR Experience"". But because this for once has a lower price and the content it does have is great, its  still very good and worth the buy."
,Recommended,496740,35433363,Posted: 2 October,all,Exyborg,"This is the title that will give you the understanding on how vast space is. You literally pilot a space ship around the solar system. You are able to visit many planets, dwarf planets, moons and asteroids. When visiting a celestial body you can enable a narrative that will give you facts and known information about it. I'm a huge fan of space and this is the type of media that will undeniably provide the coming generations with a concrete concept of what our solar system is really like."
