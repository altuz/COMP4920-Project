This really just needed to be Sunset but a serious look at changing dynamics in spousal abuse relationships over time instead of love requited/unrequited relationship amidst political revolution."

Only way to fix that is to re-start the game.The game feels like an early alpha, it feels like a concept of what the final game will be.No story.Game claims to focus on abuse on women(because men totally never ever don't get abused by women) but the ending shows a psychopathic torturer.Gameplay is nothing but a cleaning simulator.Game claims to be diving into the psyche of an abused woman, there's literally nothing like that in the game. All you do is clean a house for ~30 minutes.As pointed out by others, the game is a cleaning simulator, a bad one, with a controversial subject tacked on to sell copies.Do not buy it.Not only because the game is terrible but you shouldn't support developers like this."
,Not Recommended,496750,29691110,Posted: 4 February,all,Faudraline,"What I fear most is power with impunity. I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse. - Isabel AllendeMade in Unity,The Housewifeis an indie art project which aims to be thought-provoking about the subject of domestic abuse rather than being an actual game. I wholeheartedly congratulate the developer to pick this burdensome issue to work with, in which any kind of awareness would make a step forward towards a society with both empathy and understanding. Sadly, this is a sentiment completely separate from my outlook to the project as a game. Even though its objective is noble and praiseworthy, the project itself fails to deliver its intended effect and weight with its given medium here.The topic isn't anything groundbreaking, but quite real for thousands of women throughout the world. We are a housewife and a mother of two children who is supposedly also a victim of abuse. At the start, everything seems tediously normal, if not a bit frugal. Yet, as the game progresses, we keep facing ridiculously basic yet incredulously consuming chores as a simulation and by the end, it just becomes disturbing, fitting to its context. The game consists of 4 chapters, and in each chapter, we are given a list of tedious tasks to complete before our husband comes back home. It seems easy enough, with its mediocre goals and quite basic environment, yet such is not the issue. The game dynamics are carefully arranged for these chores to become unnecessarily hard, starting with physics and unrealistically limited deadlines. The abuse part of the game doesn't reveal itself, or present any hint to its presence rather than a persistent time limit and a sense of dread bounded to that time limit until the 4th and final chapter of the game.Now, this description that I have presented in the prior paragraph is the intended effect. What it actually ended up being so is something a bit different. We have WASD for movement, 1-2-3 for different cleaning actions and some cleaning items we must drag everywhere, like the bucket, the trash can etc. Yet, considering the game dynamic lets us carry one single item at a time, we are gonna have a meaninglessly bad time while trying to run against our time limit. What we do for 3 chapters is cleaning the house as going through monstrously long cleaning animations, watering plants - though we can water one single plant at a time - and pick up clothing, trash etc. - AGAIN, ONE FRIGGIN ITEM AT A TIME. Seriously? Who carries one sock at a time to the washing machine while doing the laundry? It is ridiculous. For each chapter we are given 3 minutes or so to go through a complete list of chores and the physics dynamic is such a catastrophe that there really should be no realistic expectancy that you'd manage to go through all this while your bucket gets stuck in doorways. The dusting animation takes forever too. Oh, and by the end of the 3rd chapter, there comes a cinematic animation and a disturbing in context final 4th chapter. Now, the animation used for all these are so bad, it becomes funny rather than disturbing. Thus, it completely fails to deliver the message, which is the main issue here.Oh, as we were speaking of animations, display isn't the strongest quality of the game either. The whole design of the environment is pretty weird, as if you have cut out 4 sections from completely different houses, and just laid them next to each other, making a patchwork of one big, empty and pretty surreal house. The house contains no personal items, no clues to observe about the relations within the family, no actual relatable living space. There is no logic to any kind of item occurrence, or even an explanation for the kind of filth that we have to deal within the house. ""We have 2 kids"", sure we do but I see no reason that kids would basically spray mud all over the place! What happened there? Who did what? Why? No back story, no dialogue, no character depth, nothing. Also physics, textures and animations are all so horrible and sad, it really basically ends up being funny. And that ""funny"" label in presentation kills the gravity of the subject, directly degrading the value of a good idea.There are some additional play sequences - called as dreams - which you can try any time you want too. I actually liked them better than the original ""story"" part of the game. Their presentation is basic, yet somewhat successful in being symbolic. Again, their gameplay is similarly tedious though, this time without the time limit.The last verdict? I do salute the developer for the idea, yet I sincerely suggest for him to adorn his game with some more context and an actual story next time, alongside a bit more relatable gameplay dynamic. It doesn't have to be easy, but the dynamic itself shouldn't be unrealistic to make it intentionally harder. The games focusing on artistic presentations or contemplative, social ideas should present a relatable enough story, rather than being an empty simulation. Grab it if you feel like giving a good idea, really badly executed a try - on heavy sale, of course.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"
,Not Recommended,496750,25201352,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,RipWitch,"In The Housewife, you play an abused housewife cleaning the house before the husband comes home. However, the biggest downfall of the game is how it is presented. The ideas are there, but how it is given falls short.The game is just doing chores, with the story just skin deep. The Housewife would of benefited from a story. How does the family get the house so dirty in one day? How did the dynamic of the husband shift to abuser? Was the husband always an abuser (how long has this been going on)? What are the 'rules' the housewife has (there's only one that is given, never leave the property, or two if you add keep the house clean)? Did the housewife ever fight back? Does the housewife have friends? Why is the front door always open (What's the point of it if you can't decide to leave? The husband is never present when you have control. It would be interesting as other games addressed gamers are wired to complete tasks, and this could of played into this)? Is the housewife's dreams tormenting her, or what? How do the kids play into this? Etc. This would help with us empathizing with the housewife, instead on how frusturating the first chapter can be. A character needs to seem real before we empathize with them, no matter how the message is frequent in society.Another thing that I was wondering is why is it in chapters if it's in one day? Why is the housewife giving up if a chapter isn't finished when she has the rest of the day to clean still? Why does the other chore items show when it wasn't there last chapter? With gameplay, the reticle brings up problems, it must be dead on to pick up or aim, and distance is hard to interpret when doing the garbage chore.However, I would like to show some parts that I noticed and I applaud the developer for. When you are putting garbage away, you can knock them out if you shake it hard enough. This will lower the process back, making you redo your process. And probably the biggest thing (since its the gameplay) The Housewife makes you hate cleaning, especially in the first chapter where it goes down the the wire.As i find the dev didn't provide any hotlines (I admit, I'm very disappointed), I link to my guidehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753280292as I included some towards the end."

But I guess the intended message is nice? Not well executed. The game over screen is so bland and confuding it feels like satire.

,Not Recommended,496750,25262525,"Posted: 30 August, 2016",all,Intelligence,"Viscera Beatup DetailVery similar to Viscera Cleanup Detail in terms of gameplay, except not as good. Not really much of a story to it aside from the fact you're a housewife, you've gotta clean the house and even if you cleanup every grain of sand in the house, your husband still comes home and beats you up anyway.No dialogue. No real plot and not to mention extremely short. Completed all 4 chapters at 100% and finished all 4 dreams within 33 minutes.The only real reason to play this game is to watch the hilarious sequence in which the husband comes home thinking he's Roman Reigns and hits his wife with a Superman Punch. Only to beat her up more and then make her clean up her own blood. Though that still doesn't equate to it being worth £3.59 which is why I can't recommend it.While I enjoyed my playthrough for what it is, I've seen free games on Steam with more content. I'm willing to change my review if more content is added in the future. However, I don't see this happening."
,Recommended,496750,32777739,Posted: 25 June,all,Lolita465,OMFG I'm laughing so hard. I get the point of the game is to raise awareness about domestic violence however it is the most unrealistic domestic violence story ive ever seen pmsl. for 3 chapters I was proper chilling out cleaning which i can only describe the first 3 chapters as viscera clean up home edition lmao and the final getting chained up and beaten in a basement chapter was like some BDSM experience lmao. :D just change i uyp with some yes instead of no and were all good there. Personally for the 1.99 it cost of steam during the sale was totally worth it for the laugh. As a victim of domestic abuse though I cant honestly get behind this as a message to help with domestic violence. In that sense it was utter crap.

,Recommended,496750,25159533,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,sotonest,"The game succeeded at what it set out to do. Its goal was to offer a window in to the psyche of some domestic abuse and domestic violence victims. It did not, however, set out to be a good game.Gameplay is nothing new but that's not the point of this game, the implications are.The time limit until the husband gets home. Having to run around and look for everything you can do to avoid failure and rushing through it attempt after attempt after attempt to just end up failing again is repetitive, boring, hard, and there's a lot of pressure because of it all, if you take it seriously and really want to succeed/pass.I honestly didn't want to play it after a few attempts. I decided to take it a bit seriously and tried to put myself in the shoes of a victim and I found myself dreading the failure of the current attempt and the failure of the next attempt. And the one after. And the one after. So on and so forth.Then it dawned on me that the game succeeded in conveying its message. Change all the attempts for a real life day and you get day after day after day after day of pure fear and dread and self-blame. Every failure is potential abuse, both physical and mental. Every day, trying to get everything done in time, trying to be better, trying to not disappoint, trying to succeed. It honestly felt horrible.If you think of the implications of the situation and take it seriously, the game succeeded in its goal. If you take the game at face value, you'll have a shallow game that's no fun and full of frustration. Honestly, if you can't empathize and sympathize with domestic violence and abuse victims after playing this game, I think it kind of makes you a horrible person.The toxic threads in the discussions section were ridiculous as well. Yes, there are male victims, everyone knows this, but the numbers show that the majority of victims are female and silencing those who speak up against domestic violence and abuse by saying ""What about guys though"" isn't helping anyone anywhere.Anyways, I recommend the game as long as you're willing to be serious about it. If you're just looking for entertainment, this isn't it."

I tried to sympathize with misogynists who think that women should be used as servants and see from the point of view where that idealogy would come from. This game was extremely unrealistic. I did not have enough time to clean the house before my husband got home, it seemed that the time given was super unrealistica nd there was no way I could have the entire house clean in that short of a time span. I'm not sure if the creators if this game thought that it was funny, but it is really not funny. Women have to deal with this harsh reality of not having the house clean before their husbands get home on a day to day basis. It is nothing  to make fun of and mock. It is really hurtful to me as a female in the gaming community that games like this even exist."
