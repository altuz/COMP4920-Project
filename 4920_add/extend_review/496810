76561198043396863,Recommended,496810,25845547,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,Lewd Shinobi,"How to fix and play in MultiplayerTo play multiplayer game, here's some conditions that you must know- No special text/emoji in your steam profile, or you will get crash when joining room.- Onlly 1 country per 1 game in server. (for example, you can't have 2 America rooms hosting the game in the same time- Both host, and players who join the room must be from the same country.From the condition above, here's how to fix it.1. At the top left, click Steam > Setting > Downloads, change your Download Region to any country that you think there's no one from that country hosting the atm. (for example, I chose Pakistan)2. After creating the room, tell your friends or anyone who you want to play with to change download region to the same country as you did.If there's nothing wrong, you and ur friends must be in the same room without issue.3. If they can't join, that means the game in that chosen country had been hosting, try step 1 again and choose other country.4. Don't forget that, you can't use special text in your steam profile atm.Note: I take no credits from this. The solution came from nice neppers from this discussion board, I just summarized and posted it here so everyone can see it easily-----------------------------------------------------------Now waiting for any modder to port these zombies into Nep 4 Dead as infected and special infected for the maximum Neperience.-----------------------------------------------------------Well, since my review was on the top by unknown reason, I decided to update and provide some information about the game for Non-Neptunia fan in case you are considering to buy this.(Of course, as a Nep fan, we have bias and often instant-buy all nep-products.（;Ф ﾛ Ф;))-----------------------------------------------------------For Non-Neptunia Fan Read Here------------------------------------------------------------ This game is spin-off and not related to the main series.- This game genre is ""Beat 'em up"" like Warriors/Musou Series from Koei.- There's leveling system but it's not complicated, just adding status in Atk, Def, HP, and Combo.- Clunky/bad camera control (For me, this one was the worst part that ruined my gameplay exp)- So-so story. The selling point is still comedy but it may hard to catch up if you don't knowcharacter and their personality from the original game.- Gameplay length is short. There are only 12 chapters and took around 30 sec - 3 mins in each mission. (Might take a little bit longer in later chapters)- Very small maps, more like you're fighting in arena in different environment.- 4 players co-op (but sill has bug and keep crashing atm)-----------------------------------------------------------In Conclusion------------------------------------------------------------ This game is average beat 'em up.- Would recommend if you are not serious about simple gameplay and better if you have friend to play with (after they fixed co-op mode)- Wouldn't recommend if you love action game with complicated combat system.- Wouldn't recommend if this will be your first Neptunia game. This isn't a good gateway game to learn what NepNep is (as same as the rest of the spin-off games) and you may end up hating this series. If you intended to do this, please play the main series first, especially Megadimension Neptunia VII."

(I'm keeping this up as a negative as it lists the initial issues and the days that they were fixed (and broken again, and fixed again) rather than shifting it to a recommended title. I always look at the negatives first and seeing these issues along with a timeline of when they were dealt with seems more useful to a prospective customer than yet another review comparing this to Neptunia U.Edits will be added to the bottom of this review as things change, original will be preserved at the top, scroll down for current information.If you liked Neptunia U you're going to like this as well.Great game, buggy as all hell on PC.It's a fresh release, so I suppose it's to be expected, but when I switch to full screen and everything goes black (there are other bugs, and some Vita legacy showing through with the graphics, but that black screen thing is the only one that's a real issue and not just nitpicking) I can't recommend this game...Yet.They'll fix it, and when they do it'll be worth it, but I'd say hold off for now.EDIT 5th October:There has been an update pushed, the crashing has stopped, but the black screen and minor freezes when the resolution switches back to 720p between every intro video is still there. Not quite there yet, but much more stable now than it was when I first installed it.EDIT 8th October:All crashing is gone, multiplayer works (but people bounce in and out of rooms like crazy and hardly anyone is online) now, the only issue is the wonky intro videos making it go nuts jumping between fullscreen and black boxes, but once you get through the intro and to the start page there's now nothing wrong with it.EDIT 17th October:Crashing again, seemingly at random, during the initial launch when screen jumps between native resolution and 720p black box hanging in the corner of the desktop. Works perfectly once you're to the menu, it's just the intro credits that are causing issues.EDIT 19th October:Crashing gone again, online play (if you can find someone in there) works, only weird resultion issues with into cinematics remains.EDIT 26th October:Blanc now says ""Trick or Treat"" in the menu. I'm not seeing any other differences. Resolution issues still present, but crashing has not come back. Game is currently stable, both offline and on, but the lobby is always deserted.EDIT 31st October:Resolution issues have been fixed. Game now plays pefrectly from launch to exit. Online multiplayer works, but is still pretty deserted, and single player has zero (at least that I've encountered) issues remaining."

,Recommended,496810,25911525,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,Y a s u r a o k a - s a n,"MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies is a great spinoff of the Neptunia series. It's very similar to Hyperdimension Neptunia U : Action Unleashed for it's hack and slash genre and that this installment features co-op multiplayer!However, in regards to playable content, I find this one lacking compared to NepU, NepU has more quests I believe and afterwards you would have to complete the tournaments + Neptral tower if you were aiming for 100% achievements, NepU provides much more play. With MegaTagmension, after finishing the 12 acts, you'll have to resort to multiplayer to get 100% and it's pretty much more quests and luck to get certain items. A few things that I do like is the accessories in the game, all accessories are avaiable to all characters and do not require multiple purchases if multiple characters are going to wear the same thing. I also like how you can adjust the position/placements of the accessories. And of course, I liked how Uzume, Plutia and Peashy are in this game along with the new character, Tamsoft.I do have some cons about the game. Firstly, the game's consistency. I feel as though the game may be a bit too easy especially when you decide to do a ""YOLO"" with a character at level 8 on a mission that recommends level 25-30 (Around there) and you are still able to beat it despite being underlevelled by almost 3-4 times, if not more. Then again, for players who love a good challenge, this may be a downside. For me, I personally don't mind.With multiplayer, I do hope there is a patch in the future that may fix some possible issues such as players joining MP games that are password protected. I am willing to play game with another player but when I set a password protected MP, I set it because I want to do solo MP for achievements and so, it'd be nice if players would stop randomly joining my password protected rooms somehow XDWould I Nepping Neppemend This Game?Yes, Nepping Yes (I'm Neptunia trash, so this opinion is very biased)Though if I were to rate it honestly out of 10, I'd say 7/10 or maybe around 6.8/10 xS"

,Recommended,496810,25848326,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,MAGES.,"Well where do I start, I personally like this game since it's Blanc's spin off, and It's basically Neptune U imporved with the addition of the multiplayer. Aside from the other imrpovements It runs well on potato PC's which is a huge help for me considering my laptop isn't really that powerful to begin with. It' also note worthing that the cutscenes change at certain times when you select a certain pair which added a replayablity for me. If I were to rate this game it would be 8/10Verdict: It's a good break from the main series and there are tons of new combos that you seriously need to learn about rather than just mash random buttons, but the only problem with this game that it's a little too short which is a downside for me.It runs at a constant 60FPS on my potato despite my terrible specs (Intel i5-5220U, and Intel HDGraphics 5500) If that doesn't tell you how well this game can run on low end machines I don't know what will."

It didn't seem to have the same quality of humor the other Neptunia games have. I had to start skipping the story mid game, because the battles can be really short. You're sometimes faced with 3 minutes of story, literally 30 seconds of gameplay, then another minute of story, then starting a new mission you may get even more story before you get more game play. If the battles were longer, this may not have been such an issue.Megatagmension has very little challenge if you learn to use all of the controls. Once I started blocking, and sticking with one character I flew through the game. A lot of the missions you will beat in 10seconds-1minuteA large part of the game are the multiplayer missions, which you can start at any time, at any level. The multiplayer missions end up significantly harder than the end boss of the story mode. During my play time, players couldn't connect to me, and I couldn't connect to others, it is/was a wide spread issue. You may have to plan on playing the multiplayer missions solo. I was able to beat all the multiplayer missions on my own, and think it might be more fun that way, it's just not challenging enough with more people.I think a lot of my gripes with the game are because of design choices based on it being developed for a portable system (PS Vita). Short missions are good for on the go systems. You can't always depend on being able to play multiplayer so it would be nice to be able to play the other half of the game without internet. Consider 2 years from now, how many people are going to be playing the multiplayer anyway..Despite it all, I had fun with it, which is why I'm giving it recommended status. But this game is not for most. If you've never played a Neptunia game, I recommend the first game: Hyperdimension Neptunia rebirth re1. If you've had your fill with Neptunia U, you can skip this one, it's not different enough."

Blanc's debut game stands taller than every spinoff in this franchise to date.I love the mainline games so much. The dank memes, the gameplay, and of course the cast of cute girls! However, the side games preceeding this entry have all been marred by one glaring issue or another that kept the player separated from the fun.There's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t keeping my satisfaction at bay here. Levels fly by with razor sharp speed, feeding me a constant drip of those cutscenes and character developments that I adore.Unforutnately the only characters that level up are the ones you're playing as. Even newly unlocked characters arrive at level 1. This means that you'll be relying on one or two characters to clear out every level. This would get tedious if the levels themseleves didn't fly by in under two minutes a pop. Before I knew it I was once again basking in the sweet tones of their voices as they engage in a story infinitely more compelling than action U (the previous musou spinoff).Don't be turned off by the relatively short duration of this game. Though it may clock in around six hours, there's virtually zero padding. Get in a level, kick their♥♥♥♥♥and leave so you can enjoy more of what makes this series great. They even reduce the importance of min-maxing and stat boosting your characters so you won't be staring at a menu screen for more than a couple moments. I spent more time dressing these adorable ladies in cute accessories and hats than I did bumping up their stats.Pick your favorite neps to beat up some zombie mobs and enjoy as the Neptunia cast take on their most thrilling and dangerous adventure yet.

Once played things stop working and just crash :( I actually really like this game and loved all the other Nep Nep games but the frustration of having to re-start the game is too much. I have 2 bugs that make it impossible to play properly: 1. Game freezes and won't launch unless I sit through all the intro stuff cause if skipped it just crashes 2. Can no go into the in game shop, game just crashes completely so I can't progress without buying new weapons ect.I never thought I would give a negative review for one of these games but honestly it isn't worth buying at all, nvm on full price.

Apart from that, it's the usual Nep game with hack and slash combat instead, and the attention going to the best CPU ever.Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that I've seen more panty shots than I have killed enemies, so 10/10.Edit: Multiplayer has some issues now and then but most of them seem to only be temporary and tend to be solved after a pc restart. The game has a decent variety of chat options you can use, but it's still pretty restrictive if you want to communicate what you want to do. There's not a whole lot to do after a few days, but it's definitely a great game for playing with friends and strangers. Getting a 5k hit combo is a pain in the rear but it can be done. Most the other achievements just require working on the game and progressing through it, and there's no need for pointless restarts of your game just for the sake of another ending.Now, if only I had friends..."

I throroughly enjoyed the Nep U and Famitsu grew up to be one of my favourite characters in the roster. Plus the game was supposed to have multiplayer! I couldn't be more hyped for this game! I even bought Vita LE for amazing physical merchandise......but after all the buildup, the game turned out to be a very disappointing experience for me. At least with Hyperdevotion I knew what I was getting into. But this.... I'm very surprised in a negative way :(Nevertheless, let's get into positives first!Pros:-Combat feels vastly improved over NepU- combos feel more fluid, new SP system is more fun, active skills feel strong but not broken. Majority of characters feel fresh and fun to play. I really enjoy mechanics of the improved combat system!-Plutia, Peashy and Uzumemake their spin off debut!-Blanc finally is being protagonist of her own game!And I really like her visual design in it!-The english VA with few exceptions is as good as ever!Noire, Uni or Nep sisters dub always cheer me up!-Vastly customisable accessories- it's really fun to play with them to alter appearence of your character!-Monsters' sounds aren't as obnoxious as in NepUCons:-The most important one,multiplayer is simply broken. I spent around an hour in total trying to get it work but all I got were crashes and ghost rooms. The only multi game I managed to run was when I made the room and played alone because nobody could join in reasonable time. It's really disappointing, given how supposedly MP is important in the game.-The MP is made even worse withartificial region locking, it's stupid to change download region just to try to be able to play with my USA friends.-The MP issue is reinforced by the fact that there isno end game at all in single player- it seems all the endgame focus went for Multuplayer mode...-The stage design in single player is simply bad. It does no justice for improved combat system at all. Every, EVERY single one of the stages is ""your character spawn - pack of mobs spawn in front of you - whack it till they die - mission complete after 30 seconds"". The stage design is much more simplistic than NepU, and NepU was already a pretty simple game.-There still are some things that feel simply wrong in the combat mechanics- like team-attack and majority of EX Bursts knocking most of the enemies back with first attack, so it's really hard to damage any enemy with the skills. The stage design usually doesn't support pushing monsters into corner (if there even are any corners at all).-Some characters still got short end of the stick with balance- For example Blanc feels really sluggish to play and is simply not fun.-Story is bad, not ""so bad it's funny"", it's failing trying to be ""funny bad"" (think of AVGN movie for example).-With an exception of few geniunely cute or funny moments,everyone from the cast lacks almost any characterisation unless going for behind the curtains scenesI think you shouldn't try so hard just to see Famitsu and Dengekiko doing anything else than roaring at each other. I didn't see every one of them yet, but truth to be told, the game didn't give me an incentive to try hard unlocking all the events neither with strong story nor strong stage design in SP mode...-While being good most of the times, the english VA occasionaly felt wrong- even if they have to reuse same VA for more than one character, they should at least make her change her voice tone even just a little bit. It really kills immersion -was Tamsoft C-Sha in disguise?-One of the most fun aspects of NepU for me -the lily dialogues - were taken away. Lilies are almost completely meaningless in the game yet again.-Soundtrack is inferior to Nep U- there are decent tracks here and there but it lacked anything memoriable like Eager Editor from NepU. For me it's telling that even for the last boss they used remix of an existing track, while In NepU they did compose new music for that event.Despite my negative review I'm still quite hyped for MP component of the game! I really want to play with my friends and I hope that the region locking or crashes won't stand in a way after few patches! I'll be more than happy to change my review to positive once that change happens and MP turns out to be as good experience as I'm hoping for it to be!Unfortunately, as of now, I think single player experience is far too weak to recommend and is simply below average. It's not hyperdevotion's level of bad, but it's still not good. And the major appeal of the game - Multiplayer -  is simply broken.For now I'd rate this game4.5/10:(  [please fix multiplayer so I can improve the score!]TL;DR- single player mode is not really fun, Multiplayer is broken. I don't think the game is worth buying until multiplayer mode is fixed.Edit as of 2017-01-04 : I tried to come back to multplayer but it feels dead, and there are only rare password-protected rooms. Those mission feel fun to play solo but unfortunately they aren't good enough to change my review score significantly - maybe up by 1 point to 5.5/10. I still wouldn't recommend this game, which makes me sad :("

It carries over what you get in story but its a different menu selection with new maps. Its a little slower with people then soloing it as enemys scale. You must wait for host to pick quest and everyone to rdy up. But you have lots of fun voice recordings to spam in that time. Then wait for people's potato computers to load. Then there are a few bugs when people leave. Its a good start for future games. Not the best or even good multiplayer but its neet to play with others. Prob best to play with a friend but not needed.

This game doesn't show much of those characteristics since the story mode is kinda short, and the gameplay is not as great as other hack&slash like Koei games or Basara.But if you're a Nep fan, then what the heck are you waiting for? Iris Heart is in it, that's more than enough of a reason to buy this game."

Of course, the fight and leveling system is here better than in Unleashed, but i don't like the game that much. The story was pretty short & easy to beat, that's one point why i dislike MegaTagmension. Actually, you could beat the final boss with a level 3 character(and you don't have to even transform). This game wasn't challenging at all like Unleashed - maybe it's because you can't grind outside the story. Even Unleashed was more challenging (and gave us a free swimsuit DLC's and your clothes could get torned up.)The game is finally fixed (i think, if not then correct me. but the region lock is still there..). It isn't fixed atall!The intros need 1 minute to play them in the beginning. When you're starting the game, you're sitting 20 seconds just to see the !f intro which is not skipable. The same goes for Compile & Tamsoft. Between the intros there's a loading time of 10-20 seconds included. With the region lock, i'm even not able to find some players anymore to play with, because the region lock is still there.The only thing that's fixed is that you don't have problems with the multiplayer anymore and the character's aren't buggy anymore. I can recommend it to people who like the Neptunia franchise, but if you disliked Unleashed - then you will do it here too. Still, i prefer MegaTagmension more than Unleashed. In MegaTagmension you have various combos to use and many things to unlock, while in Unleashed you're just spamming the A or Y button.I'm just disliking the game because it wasn't challenging at all. It's too short and easy. That's all. And there's no steam support in it - that means you can't invite your friends to your lobby (even if it's showing up) and you can't join a friends lobby.The end bossHachimajinisn't the strongest opponent in the game, thecamerais.So Idea Factory. - Compile Heart..

This game have been evolved from Nep U:Action Unleashed, the first Nep series Hack n Slash. MegaTag gives us a vibe from Nep U with a ultimately new enjoyment, Multiplayer. This time around, Blanc and Nep with others character are schoolgirl who films a indie movie for their school that nearly shut down while fighting zombies.For the story, it's bit lack of content and idea than Nep U but forthe gameplay is surprisingly nice and breathful. The game split into 2, Story and Multiplay. You can't play the story mission with others but you can easily indulge yourself by Nep jokes and you can choose any character from start if you play on Multiplay. Overall, this game is nice one but short in content yet you can easily find yourself return to play even if you already finished the whole game. One thing is that this game has something to be unlocks, so try to beat the game fully. Rating for MegaTag that I give; 10/10 for gameplay but there is more room to improve, and 5/10 for story that lacks something from it predecessor."

You just need to mash the buttons to win but must still defend and run away from enemies if needed so there's stil some tactical gameplay going on despite being minute,Characters and humar are the best selling point of the game. If you've played Nep games before you'll no longer need to understand anything because... welll... Neptune. For those who are new to the series there game is absolutely great is you want a hack and slash game. Missions are too short however to my liking, I finish some missions in under ten seconds so for people who are looking for a challenge this is not the game for you. The point of the game is to just bash some zombies dead and continue to the next take.

The most gameplay you will get in a row is about 3 minutes.  This is NOT a game in which you traverse large levels with monster packs, bosses, complete objectives etc. You load the scene, kill 20 mobs, and that's it. I haven't completed it yet, but the whole thing can probably be completed in about 3-4 hours tops. Of course there is some replayability thanks to leveling, lily ranks, treasures gathering and such.Most of the time is spent in menus and reading dialogue cutscenes, which are funny and interesting as always in the Neptunia games, but when you have to spend 5 minutes reading dialogues to get 2 minutes of action it kind of kills the fun.If you are a hardcore Neptunia fan, it will still be fun of course.

And in this school, there is a film club. In previous games Blanc has always been pegged with the trope of being a reader and being a creative writer. So, this outing, which is accredited to her, she is the film club ""writer"" and she narrates the ""story"" but this is not all, the film club is doing an amateur film about Zombies, at the same time as there is an actual Zombie outbreak at their school.So, the anime-girl-anthropomorphised console wars have done a spin off game where they are high school students, who are making a zombie film, at the same time as a zombie outbreak. Simple eh, I don't know why some people may think these games are not accessible!It pretty much follows as a cookie cutter of Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action unleashed, without the gratuitous ""clothes breaking"", and a couple of new features and tweaks to levelling up.All this additional stuff is good, but I had way more fun on Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action unleashed. And its down to one very superficial reason, loading times.It's so slow, I checked it out and its a know issue for the PC version, but I find it frustratingly long, and especially for a game which places you in a fast paced action environment, the change of pace seems obnoxious!As much as it pains me to ""dislike"" a spin-off game about anime-girl-anthropomorphised console wars, where they are high school students, who are making a zombie film, at the same time as a zombie outbreak. I cant forgive those loading times."

HDN:U with Multiplayer. That's the gist of it. It Plays a bit more like Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus than U, as the game will spawn it's enemies only from spawn points close to you, and despawn them if you go too far from them. Unlike the ""Follow the Path"" of SK, or the ""Continue on the only obvious path""/""stay in the small arena killing things until the objective is completed"" of U, most of the time you go on maps hunting for bosses, who are even denoted on your minimap!Now, for the enemies changed from U:Aztec Golems have a jump attack, and are more aggressive.Kupokitties are less hyperactive.No robot enemiesZombies that throw their head as boomerangs""Flying disco zombies"" that shoot hellfire rockets at you, very slowly.New Large bosses:-Temdinkale is a one-handed sword fighter with okay mobility and a fun to fight moveset-Megadonkale is a red dual-wielder with TONS of mobility, a pain to melee, since even his dodges damage you-Doomkale wields a hammer, is slow as hell, and is badass.-Undead Cannoneer lugs around two huge guns, and has spectral gauntlets to slap you around with in close range.-the two Mariwogus-types are large fenrir-type dogs with launchable frisbee weapons, four per doggy. They have high mobility.-Truenail and it's clone type are big walking birds with a glowy tail ending in a christmas tree light.Unlike Nep U, you no longer map your skills to specific buttons, but instead always have four skills available.Like Nep U, and SK, the camera control is abysmal, and needs a specific autohotkey script to be convenient with a mouse.The multiplayer is a pathetic joke, no real communication (no chat, there is picking up phrases from a phrasebook), no real steam integration, dead game is dead tier lobbies, few games, often someone's either playing with a low-level character who dies in two hits, or a high level murdermachine kitted out in invincibility patches, high def, keep patch, life steal patch, who can steamroll bosses without thinking... Best of all, enemies scale up in HP and Damage with more players, so playing solo mp is easier. Go figure!And as usual with IF, the game is a buggy wreck. It can lock up when looking for multiplayer servers, it can lock up before the menu, it WILL lock up (not responding) if any application asks for permission to change things in the computer.The missions are no brainers in story mode, loading times are large.So all in all I can't wholeheartedly recommend this game. Get it if you are interested in playing with one character or another (I've come for plutia, and you know how she doesn't leave anyone until she's satisfied :D ), get it if it's in the bargain bin, don't get it for full price.And if you really need some action hack'em slash'em and you haven't played diablo 2 yet, do yourself a favor and get that game. For two thirds of the price you get the base game and the expansion. The ability to play in either classic mode or expansion mode, which are two wholly different experiences. Deep itemization and high amount of character customization allow you to play the way you want (Aside from a few caveats).Battle.netis a wonderful place to be (if you can avoid the bots) and you can even activate the Perfect Gem!

Nothing. I said nothing.Pros:+ The story is funny+ The characters are awesome as always+ The general gameplay is fun+ It has multiplayer now and it was something I really would wanted in the U game+ They put really a lot of details in the voice chat, there are even catchphrases of the single characters or the unique calling ways they have to each other+ I... Honestly liked there wasn't the clothing damage system of the U game (But that could be just me...)+ Uzume ** (But that could be just me...)Cons:- That's probably one of the shortest Neptunia game I ever played, probably done this way to add the multiplayer though- There isn't an extra after played the story (I really liked the Neptral Tower and the Gamindustri Gauntlet of the U)- Multiplier is present but still a little bit bugged, it's not that easy to connect with other people even though there are servers- I honestly think the combos in the U game were better thought and more connectible to do combos.

,Recommended,496810,26013476,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,KeterLordFR,"MegaTagmenion Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies. A new spin-off game of the Neptunia franchise, based on the same system as Neptunia U and of course develloped by the same team. Just like Noire got her own game, this one has Blanc as a main character, even though Neptune is present throughout the entire game. When will a Vert-only game come out?But let's now evaluate the game.The gameplay :If you have played Nep U and got the mechanics right, it will not be hard to play MegaTagmension, as it is also a Hack-N-Slash. Although, a few changes are visible. The commands are a little bit different, and if you play with a keyboard you might wanna go through the settings to re-assignate some keys. Goodbye to the torn-off duds caused by the monsters, and goodbye to the Nepbull released by monsters. Now, if you wanna heal during battle, you have to buy items and equip them. New ennemies, and a new way to improve your characters using ""Ability points"" that you gain through leveling. No medals anymore, but instead treasure pieces (in fact consoles) that let you unlock new outfits. You can also by accessories and customize your characters, this can be helpful later. Overall, an easy-to-understand system. Also, if you're used to grinding in the Neptunia games, try not to grind too much. A lvl 70 character won't help you fight the last boss in an epic battle, as you need to be around lvl 40 to beat it. You don't want to kill it too easily.The Story :As I said earlier, this game's main protag is Blanc, our Justice goddess (No, Blanc, that was a praise, put that hammer down! ). Our 8 Gamindustri rulers (Yes, I put the Candidates as rulers) have enrolled in Gamicademy, a school situated on an island in the center of Gamindustri, so that anybody from any country can join. They have joined this school to understand humans better and help their people. But when they hear that the academy is gonna close because of a lack of students, Neptune don't hesitate to do anything she can to save it and bring more students. The story itself is pretty entertaining, our 4th-wall breaks are still here and some scenes are an hommage to the community. The time completion may depend on your will to end the game fast or not. For me, it took 8 hours, and I haven't ""fully"" completed the game as there are some scenes that can only be unlocked via certain conditions (But in-game hints can help you unlock them). A whole lot of characters from the different games, as well as a new character brought by the constant wish of the Devs to put themselves in the game : Tamsoft. The same way IF and Compa represents Idea Factory and Compile Heart (And don't forget our dungeon helper Stella, representing FelliStella), Tamsoft represents... Well, Tamsoft, they didn't bother trying to change the name, which is not completely a bad thing. She's a rather strong character and can become useful in some fights. (She even have a transformation).The Multiplayer :Remember earlier, when I told you about customizing your characters? Well, it is mainly because there's a brand-new multiplayer mode, allowing you to take on quests with up to 3 other people. The quests aren't related to the main game, and the Multiplayer has in fact it's own story, and can take some time to complete. You will even be able to play directly with the HDD form of a character, while another player uses it's normal form. (It happened to me, I was playing as Purple Heart while somebody else was playing as Neptune, and we cleared bosses with an excessive amount of Neptune Break). You can choose wether to use a save from the Story mode, keeping your lvls, or you can start with a brand-new save only for Multiplayer and work your way from lvl 1 to lvl 99.Issues :I have only noticed a few issues :-Whenever I start the game, I have to wait 5-10 minutes before reaching the main menu. I suspect this is because I don't have the perfect configuration.-Sometimes, in multiplayer, people might try to join while you're doing a quest, which may results in endlees loops of : <Player> has joined, <Player> has left, <Player> has joined, <Player> has left, etc...So this concludes my review of this game. A rather good spin-off that doesn't deviate from the franchise, a good story, a good gameplay and very few issues. For me, I give this game a 9.5/10"

It pulls the action-hack-and-slash gameplay off more elegantly and the characters in general feel more balanced. For instance, ranged characters are no longer effectively god mode.The plot is about what I've come to expect from a Neptunia title: The goddesses attend school to try and understand humans better. There's a zombie outbreak. So they decide to film a zombie movie while resolving the zombie outbreak to advertise the school.This game includes multiplayer, which is pretty fun and a bit chaotic. It has a Monster Hunter Lite feel, especially with the bigger bosses.The only honest complaints I have about it is the farming required for some of the Treasure items, which gets repetitive when you only need 1 item that drops from 1 boss and wind up doing that boss 50 times. This is especially annoying for the multiplayer mission-specific treasures."

No, you can't beat the quest now and are stuck after the last 10 seconds until the person leaves. Why isn't there a 'loner' option for multiplayer where the room is created but no-one other than you can enter it? Would help out a lot in the case of online grinding as online is needed for achievements...Furthermore, multiplayer rooms are SERIOUSLY needing some updating in password department as despite me putting in a random number password, people sometimes get lucky (Or the password means nothing and gets removed when the room is created. Again, needs updating) and enter which again, causes the game to not finish off the multiplayer mission unless they leave before the timer at the end runs out.If your playing solo and in single player, get the game even though it is short. If for multiplayer, I suggest to stay away until we get a patch and better password systems as it is ridiculous right now (I just want my 2x Megadonkle quest complete!)"

A bunch of goddess going to school and doing a movie. What could possibly go wrong? Nice plot turning, and some peoples might complain about the lack of seriousness, but he? That is what make the Neptunia serie great for me, and if you can't live with it, you are in the wrong fandom.-The inclusion of Tamsoft and some characters of the main series, which were missing in Action Unleashed, made the fighting more interesting. Sometimes I just find myself button mashing until I find a usefull combo.-The inclusion of the fan service from the previous Hack n Slash of the serie made it a bit awkward, as I didn't play Action Unleashed before this game, and didn't expect they give the Costume Break as a costume from the start.-For the Multiplayer, its rather dead but still worth it if you know peoples actually playing the game. Its also a great way to break the main story and raise your character with less grinding (in the case you play online with someone who is farer in the game).Even if some peoples complain about the gameplay, I find it pretty neat and a good addition to the serie. I recommend this game for peoples of the Fandom, but you can start with this one if you want. I would say one should rather play the main serie, then go on Action Unleashed before playing this game, as you shall then understand who Dengekiko and Famitsu are, and why the latest slap peoples faces with a giant lobster."

,Recommended,496810,33147224,Posted: 2 July,all,hecate,"Honest Review: A game with good graphic, design, combat, accessories and editable character appearance. BUT without a proper stage. Each stage are extreamely short that you can end in within 20s.5/10 Only recommended for the game design. 10/10 if there are bigger stages."
