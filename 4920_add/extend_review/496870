The FPS isn't perfect...Going more in-depth into hardware issues, the game doesn't have in-game settings, so for users suffering low fps you'll need to reduce your res in windows outside the game to improve performance.The game running @1080P has mild jiitter so I use dxtory to limit the game to 55FPS, however at my native 2k/UHD[2560x1440] res the game chugs between 37-45 so I limit it to 35FPS.. this is absurd because my hardware.-I7 5820K 6Core @ 3.8ghz-16gb DDR4 @2400mhz-GTX 1080 EVGA SC [Driver: 369.95 DCP Latency HOTFIX]-Win 7 Home Premium 64BitIf you can deal with the minor issues at this price tag you'll find a small game you can enjoy, don't assume this game is hard to run, it just doesn't seem to utalize hardware well so I assume most rigs will see a similar FPS curve.--Sorry for grammar, format, and other review issues, it's 1:45am x.x--"

There are not many lvls but that doesnt mean that u will win this game fast, it can take u really long to find the best way to play the lvl and to get all achievements that include secrets, beat the game with no deaths and more. I´m recommending this game to everyone that want a little challange for the evening night or so :D and im really glad steam gave me a -90% cupon card cause i wouldnt find this game in the store and if i would i wouldnt think its something for me, yet it was incredibly challanging and i have much fun to play this game :)) Keep up the gr8 work!! <3"
,Not Recommended,496870,30402662,Posted: 8 March,all,Michael Rahmani [Genuine Pins],This game is too frustrating. I cannot reccomend it. I even got it for only 30 cents and I still dislike it.

However, this game is definitely not something I will recommend. The controls are not as smooth as they can be and it is basically a trial and error process until you realize where you are supposed to jump and when do you flip yourself. Some may argue this is where the challenge comes in, but I think there should be a better balance in the game where it proves to be a challenge, while still making it reasonably easy without dying more than you can count to pass a level. The principle of the game is nice where you jump and you can flip yourself. Even more so with the inverted regions where you automatically flip. However, I never got to the point where I can say I'm liking this game mechanic.If you want to try it, I highly recommend getting it on sale like I did. At least you won't feel too bad for having spent money on a game you were hoping to like, but dashes your hopes."

But this game doesn't actually cost $3.29 CAD, it will cost you two monitors, and three keyboards, some knot tying lessons, and some rope."

,Not Recommended,496870,32033830,Posted: 28 May,all,TigerTrix,"I like little platformers, but I got frustrated with the controls on the first level.  It does support a gamepad or keyboard, and runs fine.  It has a good introductory level too that teaches you the basics.  But that's when I decided it isn't for me when I kept ending up on spikes due to controls.  (1/5 stars, get it for trading cards)."
,Not Recommended,496870,34493021,Posted: 25 August,all,light_bringer777,"What kills it is the control and the punishing-yet-boring level design. The character accelerates way too slowly for this kind of platforming which creates artificial difficulty. I didn't find it challenging so much as ""are you kidding me?"" kind of irritating."
