,Recommended,496890,24356532,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Earl of Trollbridge,"*Spoiler Alert*I picked up this game the day it was released. I was attracted by its unique pixel graphics. I am glad that I bought it.In this game, 'you"" are the one who is peeping into some random guy's phone. The phone belongs to a terrorist suspect. It seems that you've make a deal with the government in return for your own safety. The secret service forces you to gather information off SMS, social media and photos that would convict the owner, a 17 year-old High School student who is dissatisfied with the government. You can either choose to comply the instructions to win your own ""freedom"" or to be a ""hero."" There are multiple endings, which are based on the choices you made.Replica is far from just a game. After going through the messages and social media posts, I realize this guy is not a terrorist at all. He is just a rebellous high schooler who has family and friends that love him and are worried about him. He is innocent. Yet all I was instructed is to find out info that can be used against him. In another word, I have to make some♥♥♥♥♥♥up to get my own♥♥♥♥♥out of this or I rot in jail be like him. What the hell am I supposed to do? Should I comply? Should I play hero? What in the world am I supposed to do?""He must be a communist because lawful citizens would never know who Che Guevara is!"" This is one of the messages I received from the secret service. That hit me really hard. It happened again when ""my"" dad thought the fact I was missing is because of the terrorists and he vowed to do his best to develop this privacy-peeping softwear to protect other people because this is the only thing that ""makes sense."" Of course, he doesn't know the government, the ""noble"" guardian of freedom and liberty, is actually the one who is waterboarding his son!Guys, is it still a game or the exact world we are now living in? Even since 9-11, governments have been justifying their invasion of privacy with the need of national security. Recently after the rise of the Daesh/ISIS/ISIL and numerous terrorist attacks, our privacy is undersiege. Because we are scared, we let the government do whatever they want because some of us would always justify it with the sake of ""security."" Thus the rise of the right is taking place all over the west. You see Donald Trump gaining popularity even when he said he is gonna waterboard or take out some terrorists' family. At the same time you see Brexit. Before that you see the Austrian far right almost won again. And before that you see the Lega Nord taking over the entire Northern Italy, including the traditionally liberal regions. And before that the Swiss far right has already won. When is the last time the right is this powerful? Does the the rise of Mussolini and Hitler ring any bell to you? Does the Red Scare ring any bell to you?And this game mentions ""bodo league massacre"" multiple times. Check this out:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodo_League_massacreThe game ends with ""Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato."" As someone who studies Italian history professionally, I almost cried. That is the motto of the Italian Fascist Party.""Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State.""Wait, an unknown number is calling me...let me see..."

I think rather then multiple endings I would of prefered a longer 'standard' playthrough.

You go through their texts, their social media, pictures, anything and everything you can access. But after getting a few endings (there are 12 total) you realise there is a lot more to the story. Are you working with the good guys? Are you a bad guy yourself? Do you even know what you are a part of?The game is definently cryptic and will take quite some time in order to find all of the endings. It definently reminds me of Don't Touch Anything, there is even a related achievement. For a game that's less than 3 dollars, you'll definently be getting your money's worth. If you liked Don't Touch Anything and those types of games, I would suggest giving this a try.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6n32j5j-68If you'd like to see what the game play is like I've included a video of getting one of the endings from start to finish (I apologize, there is no sound at all) feel free to use it as well if some of you get stuck at some places."

Perhaps it's worth a sale prize but I wouldn't reccommend it for; how short it is, how little options there are and how ambiguous the moral is.Basicly it gives you some small taste of hacking into someone's iphone with puzzle solving and exploring a few applications and send you to your way with a political message of how communication privacy is impotant.Can be enjoyed if you like such games but when compared to games with similar premises like ""Papers, Please"" it's barely worth your money and attention due to the wasted potential and bad execution."

To not spoil too much, you're locked in a cell and tasked with going through a suspected terrorist's phone. The rest is kind of similar to Papers Please, but I'd also liken it to something like a puzzle in the Zero Escape series on a much larger scale. If you enjoy the story in Papers Please, and how you're a small person that can make big changes, or enjoy the puzzles in Zero Escape, I'd say buy it."

,Not Recommended,496890,24345056,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Frivolous,"This game is an interesting one, if only because I'm not totally sure how I feel about it. Some elements I really liked, others I didn't.PROSThe art style matches the sense of gloom surrounding the story very well - very little color, primarily shades of black.The 'gimmick' (for lack of a better word) of only being able to use your phone allows for some interesting puzzle mechanics - particularly with the photo album.Music also fits well into the game - I can't say I will actively seek it out in my free time, but I don't mind listening to it while playing the game.The way the game dev incorporated the standard options of a game into his own game was cleverThere are multiple endings, so there's at leastsooomereplayability.At the end of the day, it's still a cheap game.CONSMy main gripe with this game is the way it handles its themes, and judging by the other negative reviews, I'm not alone in this. The overall writing in the game is good, but when it turns to its main theme of a totalitarian government, it turns into a cartoon. The dev is determined to beat you over the head with this important message goddamnit, and this means there can be no subtlety whatsoever!The mechanics, at least for me, got old quickly. The lack of scene changes mean that you focus primarily on these mechanics, and no new ones get introduced throughout the game.It's painfully obvious where the 'diversions' (i.e., different endings) take place - you'll be told very specifically not to do this thing or to do this thing - and just to make sure you get it, they'll often repeat themselves - ""Make sure you don't do X!""Overall, I'd say this game is ok, but certainly not amazing from either a story or a puzzle perspective."

When I first started playing (I’m not going to lie) I did get stuck - searching endlessly for the answer, I was considering quitting as I thought that there was a problem with the game. But, it was just me being an idiot and I did eventually did find the passcode. Personally, i think that (for at least the first part of the game) there should be a tutorial, maybe guiding you to get the passcode, especially when incompetent players like me take hours to find it. Apart from getting stuck on the first part of the game, I did find the rest of the game enjoyable. There are lots of small quirky details, and feel good moments. There are achievements for just about every action you take in the game, and this boots your self-esteem especially when you’ve just solved a puzzle. In conclusion the gameplay is smooth and i didn’t notice any lags or experience any game crashes which is a good sign.GraphicsNice*For this game graphics was a hard thing to critique. Honestly there isn’t much that I can comment about the artwork, as most of it is fairly simple pixel art - as nice style for the game. I don’t think that any of the artwork was bad, but considering the game style,  I don’t think that the artwork of the game could’ve been approached from any other angle while producing a good result. So in conclusion, I think that the art was good and fit the game nicely, I personally don’t think that much could’ve been improved about it.SoundFantastic*Music was one thing that was nailed in this game, and the developer chose the right tracks for the game. There was a good variety and it conencidekd with the game, making it changing the soundtrack easy and smooth. That being said, I do think that there wasn’t enough tracks to keep listening to, and I kept hearing the same song over and over again. So while the soundtracks are good - I don’t think that there are enough of them to sustain the game. The selection of music is nicely intertwined into the game and the gameplay allows you to be able to fluidly change the music that you’re listening to. In conclusion, the music selection is limited, but fits very well with the game.ControlsNice*The controls of this game are fine, and completely sensible. There are only a few controls in this game, and you mainly just use left click. This fits with the game and I don’t think that any other key bind would be able to deliver the same experience. You cannot change any of the key binds and I don’t think that you need to. In conclusion, the key binds fit perfectly and don’t need to be adjusted.OVERALL SCORENice**All scores can be found in the key at the top of the review"

An innocent citizen being prosecuted as a terrorist simply because he slightly differed from the governments ""ideal citizen"": an obedient citizen, who only does ""government-approved"" things and does not hide anything, no matter how private.END OF SPOILERThe game provides an interesting experience: Going through someone elses phone to collect data.

I am concerned only about how the game experience feels, at this point. I mean this is an indie game that is trying to make you feel something, right?AlthoughReplicahas some heart, it is highly flawed.Essentially, in this title you are lurking around on some guy's phone who is being fingered for terrorism.The whole political-terrorist-homeland security story is hella boring, IMO. It is too cliche and played out. Literally nothing original for a game purely driven by story. I mean I literally saw one of those Che Guevara t-shirtsin the game- that set the tone for how cliche this story is.The mobile phone is very limited.When I tinker around on a mobile phone, there should be several layers of depth with menus and setting and backgrounds and internet searching ability, etc. In fact, you can't even 'scroll' with middle-mouse-button or double fingers on trackpad like on a phone or zoom in on photos. I could go on and on, but needless to say the phone (ie. the main interface of this game) isverylimiting.Gameplay simply amounts to spam clicking. So much, in fact, that the game tells younotto spam click, likely because thats how most of the testers went through it, lol. Yes there are a few ways they punish you for spam clicking, but who cares if it can be used as a legit strategy to get through it. Very little is really all that interactive.This game should feel like a sandbox, but instead feels like a very small room - you think you can wander for hours, but quickly realize each 'app' offers very little.The writing is nothing special, and in fact could use some work. I can't decide if that is because the story is so cookie-cutter, or if the writing is actually not great. The characters allfeelthe same because they were likely written by the same person(?) if I had to bet.While people rave about the music (and it is decent), I don't think it is all that appropriate for the pace of this game.Lets not argue too much about this since it's probably just my tastes. But there it is.Pros:+The experience is fine for the cheap price.+Interesting idea.+Multiple endings offer replayability, which is great.+There are a few twists in the story that help make it a bit more interesting, although still nothing groundbreaking.Cons:-Definately feels like a mobile game - spam clicking can you get you quite far. This is basically a find-and-seek game with different facts hidden on the phone. Hardly innovative.-While the mobile device should feel like a literal sandbox (ie. like real mobile devices), it is very limited,almostlike you are on rails.-Music isn't bad, but I think we could do better here (especially considering other reviews).-Writing needs work to help make characters all feel different.-The story is beat. Very cookie-cutter ho-hum we've heard it all before.-Guessing passwords is never so easy in real life. It does not help at all with submersion.It's only three bucks, but it teased me with being the nextPapers Pleaseor something similiar.It most definately is not of that calibre. I finished one ending, and may give it one more go, but my opinion will not likely change.Peace,"

The puzzles usually focus around being able to put together different pieces of information on the phone in order get into secret accounts and crack the persons password. Personally, I love this kind of puzzle because it uses the player actual intuition and cleverness in order to solve them.The game has numerous endings. Some are serious, some not so much. Just finishing the game is easy, but there are puzzles that I don't even know how I could begin to start solving yet, so there can be some challenge to it.... Or I'm terrible.

I only find one flaw in the game, so I'll just say that first: the overall concept and implementation of it really excels, but writing may be too-comical or unrealistic/heavy-handed for some people, which may break the game for you, if you have very high expectations of it and also you think this topic shouldn't be tackled in a funny way.Other than that, this game really comes together so well -- from the idea of censorship and government survillience, to the actual plot, to using the ""phone"" as the interface of the game, to how puzzles are implemented and solved using said phone, and all its visual and audio design -- almost everything comes together and compliment each other.There are also many hidden endings (though some of them don't actually feel like an actual proper ending), so although the game is short for 1 play session (like 30 minutes, or if you are really bad at it maybe 1 hour), it actually mounts up to several hours of figuring out hidden messages if you don't resort to walkthroughs and try to hunt the achievements and endings yourself."

The UI was fine, if a bit annoying that I couldn't use the scroll wheel to move through the text messages, and the aethestic was alright. Gritty and minimalist, it served it's purpose. However, while I usually love games where you have to piece together a story or mystery, the story in this game is very heavy-handed to the point of ridiculousness. It really comes off as the rantings of a conspiracy theorist and his idea of what the ""future"" holds. (The game is actually set in 2015 which makes it all the more difficult to immerse myself and believe that this sort of scenario could really play out in America in the way the game says it did.)**SPOILERS AHEAD**Essentially you are a teenager who has been rounded up by the government with a bunch of other people from your school by Homeland Security. For same inane reason, Homeland Security gives you another prisoner's phone and tells you to snoop through his phone to find proof he is a communist-terrorist hybrid. Apparently, they have already been snooping through his social media accounts and messages, however, because they already know quite a bit and tell you to stop trying to get into his ""Follow"" account because they've already assessed it. The agent you talk to just becomes this Big Bad, just seeming to enjoy depriving people of their rights, even going so far as to joke about water-boarding the boy you are snooping on.There are multiple endings, but really only three or four out of the 12 are worth seeing. Two endings require you to leave the game running for hours (one for 2.5 hours and the other for 26 hours). I actually left my game running for 2 hours to get one of those endings, and the ending left me disgraced with the result. (You get in touch with the boy you are snooping on, and he tells you to press a button on the phone on November the 5th, two and a half actual hours away in game. You wait and press the button, and it turns every phone in the country into a fart machine. People then march to the capital holding their fart machines high in revolution.) There is also these bizarre endings that play off the Matrix red pill-blue pill choice that basically end in saying that ""BIG BROTHER IS ALWAYS WATCHING OOGA BOOGA!""Honestly, as I'm writing this review, I think that this entire experience surely must have been a parody. Between the over-the-top nature of the villian, the absurdity of the situation presented, and several of the ludicrous endings, it has to be. If so, I still can't reccomend it, but at least that provides the player with something to think about.TL;DR: Came for a serious mystery plot; got a fart joke."

You get to snoop into the contents of a stranger's smartphone and crack simple passwords. The game is short, but there are several endings. Figuring them out offers some challenge. It's a nice, simple game well worth a dollar or two."

It is well put together, and I like the aspect that it has many endings that can happen depending on what you do. It is a nice pixel graphics and is actually well to read considering how up-close the phone is to your screen. Remember what your Mom said? ""Don´t sit too close to the screen, you´ll hurt your eyes!"" Well.. She is right if you play long enough or focus too much.Putting that aside, this is a very good game for people who like dark, but good story lines. I do have to warn, there is profanity and sexual refrences that I did not enjoy needing to refer back to, to figure something out."

,Recommended,496890,33181508,Posted: 3 July,all,This is 𝑛𝑜𝑡 a scam.,"Replica is a truly unique game. It was an interesting experience, and the puzzles were really well played out over the multiple endings. Apart from a few minor things (like why Tom suddenly speaks of ""Enhanced Interrogation"" as a good thing) that seemed a bit off about the characters, I absolutely loved the game."

I had to look up a guide to know that there was more then 4 ending.Great game, wish it took more time to reach an ending though since it take 2-5 min after your second playthough.except the 2 playthough where you have to leave your game open for 4 hour and 28 hour"
