I played it a while a I really loved the game to rate it and tell you why I loved it... and why you would love it too!PROS:◉ Neon styled game.◉ Really simple and relaxing gameplay.◉ Lovely and amazing dubstep music!!!◉ Cheap steam trading cards!◉ The developers keep updating the game. They announced a multiplayer mode. (When it comes, my review may change).CONS:◉ 4 game modes without any difference in the gameplay, so you would be bored easily.◉ When you pause the game and you try to restaure, the game freeze. That's the most common and frustrating bug in the game.Even with that horrifying bug I loved the super simple gameplay and the music of course!!!My final rate: 75/100"
,Not Recommended,497050,31383735,Posted: 26 April,all,Astrophilia,"Shape Shifter is a good game for no more than 15 minutes at a time. The game has few upsides and some major cons that ruin the game. If they made the game modes more different and fun, the game might be better. Overall rating, I'd give it a 4/10.PROS:◉ Simple game◉ Good dubstep music (Is this even a pro?)◉ Cheap trading cards◉ Neon themedCons:◉ 4 game modes and very little difference in them.◉ Has a few minor bugs.◉ Can get boring easily.◉ Asking price is high for such a simple game.◉ No tutorial.◉ Grammar and spelling errors all throughout the game.◉ Game crashes frequently."

When I push the space bar to jump it doesn't really do anything. It took me FOREVER to figure out how to jump in the 1st place. IDK if it is just me but I have to rapidly bang on my space bar in order to move a cm on the screen and I can only push the space bar so many times in a short amount of time, thus I die not even a second after the game starts. There are too many things that you are trying to get us to NOT hit that it is oerwhelming. I think that a tutoral would be very benificial. Also the homescreen goes completely blank after I loose, causing me to completely close the game in order to start over. In order to close the game I have to use the windows key to pull up the desktop in order to close the game.This is a bad game. I had a coupon that I got from completeing a badge for another game so I thought that I would give it a try since the game would only cost me $0.10. I regret it and wish that I could get that money back because I could use it to get a card/ something else from the market."

The gameplay is a harder to control 'Helicopter' game where your path is sporadically and unreliably possible to get through, since you are constantly a different shape.0/10"

Recorded my wave score as my jump score and now I can't beat it :(. Also, at other points the flashing lights become so intense in clean mode that I stopped being able to tell red from green at all and proceded to perish.Great little game.Riddled with bugs."

( can i get the names of the songs though? that would be nice )-The Only Negitive, when ever I go into a game mode and then i die, and thenn i click the ""back"" box, the screen is just blank with its music and background, instead of showing the single player option and the controls and options box. So if I want to continue to play the game i have to load the game up again, but the volume button is aleast still there."
