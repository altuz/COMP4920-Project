,Not Recommended,497100,31254408,Posted: 20 April,all,Duckhunt Doge,"Plain old terrible.Major issues as others have stated. Music randomly stops. ZERO options. Want to change keys? Nope. Want to lower the god awful music (when it's actually playing)? NOPE. And my favourite is the cursor randomly not working. Having to alt-tab to get my cursor back just to hit ""continue"" to move to the next level. Just terrible.ONLY redeeming quaility is if you want easy achievements. 1 per completed level.Even for $1, not worth it."

76561198173599053,Not Recommended,497100,31221356,Posted: 18 April,all,Promthuis,"Pros-Game can be for the first few levels-Easily obtainable achievements for you achievement hunters!-Currency systemCons-The game lacks any motive and or drive to keep playing.-The shop for currency is lackluster considering that there are only three items.- Wonky physics-Levels lack difficulty-Game breaking glitch where the game locks your cursor in the middle of the screen preventing you from going to the next level and the only way to avoid this is to ALT+TAB out and in which is a downside to anyones expirence old or young!Overall I think this game could be fun for kids under twelve or for a quick buy to waste some time getting achievements or trading cards, but, I have to say this game didn't quite hit the mark for me. So no, I don't recommend this game."

,Recommended,497100,28916145,Posted: 1 January,all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","FootRock is an alright game for achievement hunters. It's not too fun on it's own if played for any reason other than achievement hutning, and while not plagued by bugs or issues with physics (something too common in 60 cent bargain bin sale games), this game just isn't fun beyond the achievements you gain. You finish your achievements list after only about 1/3 of the total game's levels, there are no collectible-related achievements for coins. This means that all you have to do to 100% this game is progress through the levels without worrying about the coins along the way, which makes some levels substantially easier.I'm recommending this game solely on the basis that you're playing it for achievements or completionist prestige, if you are, this is a pretty fun game to play, again, I didn't feel frustrated or jipped on a lot of my deaths, and knew what I did wrong and how to correct it. It's worth the <1 hour you will put in to finish the achievements list."
