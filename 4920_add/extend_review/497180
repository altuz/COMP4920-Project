It was such a great game back then! Here's my review on Street Legal Racing: Redline v2.3.1 (As of 8/9/2016)Short Review-PROS:*Great car customization (In-depth engine, suspension, & car body building)*Many different races to choose from, whether its track, drag, or street racing (or even demolition derby)*Good soft body physics*Decently sized city to roam around inCONS:*Has a big problem of crashing alot (it has crashed a total of 13 times in the 4.1 hours I've played it)*̶N̶o̶ ̶s̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶m̶o̶d̶s̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶t̶e̶a̶m̶ ̶v̶e̶r̶s̶i̶o̶n̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶T̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶m̶a̶d̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶e̶x̶c̶e̶p̶t̶i̶o̶n̶a̶l̶ ̶b̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶d̶a̶y̶;̶ ̶e̶v̶e̶n̶ ̶m̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶s̶o̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶n̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶w̶a̶s̶ ̶a̶l̶r̶e̶a̶d̶y̶.̶ ̶(The new devs should either add the Steam Workshop, o̶r̶ ̶m̶o̶d̶d̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶b̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶o̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶)̶*Removed cheats.

This game is a great game to pick up (especially for the sale its on right now at $5.94). It truly is not a waste of money. This game has a great deal of customization to it, like no other game yet today. This game was my childhood, and I love it so much. It really brings back good memories. If these new devs could update the game a little more & polish it up a bit more, I bet even more people would flock to this game. I reccomend this game to anyone & everyone that likes cars &/or racing games. Its truly a great experience!My Rating  8.5/10  (As of 8/9/2016)"

I've been playing this series on and off for quit e a long time, and it's great to see some new life being brought to it. Decent driving physics matched with an adjustable difficulty make for a really good overall experience. Plenty of content, a little bit of a grind, but from Road Racing on purpose built circuits, Drag Racing against others on the streets at night, putting together a vehicle from a great assortment of parts, fine tuning the engine to perfection; It's all enjoyable to some degree. Be warned that there are a few bugs; However, the community behind this game is one of the strongest you'll find.A must have if you're an Automotive Enthusiast of any kind.

,Recommended,497180,32734684,Posted: 24 June,all,Drunk people with firearms [DFS],"This game was a wildcard for me.  Last year I picked this up and dived right in because, well, I'm a gearhead and I like to break things.  But at the time, the game was in such a frustratingly unstable state that I'd get a game crash every 5-10 minutes.  With that said, I didn't pick it up for several months.Several months later, the devs have been hard at work to fix some of the many problems that lay within previous versions of the game, and now it's mostly playable.  So now, I get a crash every 40 minutes-1 hour.  That's quite a marginal improvement!Anyway, I've fought temptations to mod it for quite a while.  This game is very moddable, and it has a fairly large modding community backing it, as well as modding support from the devs!  If you get really lucky, you might find a car you drive every day on the modding website like I have.  If you take my route to recreate your vehicle in this game, you may run into slight issues with the game limitations or the mods not having EVERY single precise detail for your car.  Here's a comparison between my real truck and my recreation in-gamehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=954273036http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=954315264This game is really neat, and it's great the game has such versatility to support the huge variety of mods out there!  I can wrap the truck around a tree without destroying my wallet or my current life state!I love cars with character, and this game covers that aspect too with the used car dealer.  So many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ beige Willards!I do think the controls could be better.  The driving is really sensitive and floaty.. Also, every car you will ever own will peel-out.  Every car behaves like it has an LSD or locked diff, and it's a bit offputting to see a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sedan that makes 67 hp on the dyno ANNIHILATE the tread on the tires.I recommend you pick it up, you may be suprised."

Very glitchy, crashes more then you'd like, but I can't name a rice 'n race game with the sort of car building/modding experience as you get in the Street Legal series. Except maybe that failed Kickstarter for a successor by the same company. Ah well.What I'm more interested in is if SLRR 2.3.1 will still be on the store in a week's time. I'm going to assume they have some sort of deal with Invictus if they're going to monetise a mod of their game, as old as it is. Even without that, this version's still a legal minefield. Music I wonder if they've got the rights to use. Many, many real brand logos (other then the ones included in the original game) throughout game pictures and usable by the player. Meme faces as decals (Important when the Trollface meme creator is able to get it's likeness pulled from PAYDAY 1 and 2). For some reason you can put the red Angry Bird on your car as a decal, I wouldn't know why you'd want to but you can. Real life circuits in the all-new Amateur events mode. Hell, the Flatout destruction derby arena was ripped to be used for the derby events. At least the 'base' game doesn't come with real cars, only the vague likenesses offered by both SL and SLRR.It all seems to point to a group of talented modders who had no idea what they're getting into by slapping a price tag on a community mod and getting it up on the Steam store."

Watch out on money though because it disapears fast.I found this game about a month ago and its educational, i new nothing about cars and now i know a small enough amount to build a simple engine in game. i couldnt do non of this in real life but the more you play the more you learn on how an engine is built and what goes were.Its simple, if you enjoy building, racing, costomzing, free roaming, crashing, repairing and diagnosing vehicles then i highley recommend this.

This basically a mash up of mods almost as old as the game it self. So what they have done is taken and thrown it up on steam for $10 to make money of it. It's still notoriously buggy. Still frequently crashes, and built of a game engine released in the late 90s. For an old bargin bin/  Totino's Pizz Roll Box game it refuses to die despite the fact it has always been a buggy unstable mess. Seriously if people had supported this game this much when it was first released it would've actaully been one of top ten games of all time. Unfortunately is has suffered from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer, and greedy♥♥♥♥♥publisher since it's inception so it's just that one poorly made game that refuses to die.Note: Image Code isn't the original developer."

Imagecode managed to revive the game and put it on steam. Even till this day, They slowly update this game. What makes it unique is that this is a game using an engine from the late 1990s and was released in 2003, but is still being updated as of 2017.The game is quite fun with tons of tuning and racing. You can tune up a car and take it to a street race, drag race, or another racing event. Career mode can be challenging as you have little funds to buy a functioning car and start racing. If you accidentally crash, the effects can be devastating. You will lose parts and your chassis will become mangled up. And worse yet, crash damage is permanent unless repaired with money. Once you get enough cash and a good car, you can fine-tune your car and decorate it with your heart's desire.The game also uses workshop integration as well as having a large modding community online. There are thousands of mods that add cosmetics, performance parts, cars, and even new tracks.Sadly, the game is NOT stable. Crashes are more than common and can lead to deletion of progress. Every button click makes you cross your fingers in hope that the game wont crash.

Resolutuion only seems to save for 1 game boot (not a huge issue, just have to launch twice each time I go on).Don't get this game if you're strickly biasing it off graphics and gameplay.

For example, you don't just upgrade a stage 1 engine to a stage 2 engine. You buy individual engine components and assemble them. In the right order. Do you know the optimal air/fuel ratio for a specific type of fuel and engine configuration? You'll need to find out if you want to get the best from your car. What spring rate is best for the suspension setup you have and the intended use of the car? What shock absorber settings? It really is that detailed and it has a strong effect on how a car handles.There's a Roguelike philosophy in this game, in that game over is game over. I had to restart half a dozen times. You start with only one car. If it's damaged and you can't afford to repair it to a working state, game over. Start again. That will probably happen to you because damage is heavy. You're not going to get away with minor damage after clipping a post at 60 mph. Angry or incompetent AI opponents might well ram you. You won $1000 in the race...and they rammed you into a lampost, causing $5000 of non-cosmetic damage. You only have $2400? Game over, start again.And now the negative points:Bugs. The developer of this new version is doing a good job, but they were starting from a game that had more bugs than a square mile of the Amazon rainforest. There are still a lot of bugs (this is true for build 920, the latest build at the moment). Some are irritating. Some are gamebreaking. Some are odd (e.g. on my PC fullscreen is currently effectively broken because the framerate is so low, but windowed mode at the same settings can reach hundreds of FPS)Many of the car parts aren't fully described. This matters because of the depth of customisation. For example, which V6 engine block is best? No way of telling without buying each one and building a complete engine from it, because none of the blocks have any description.The way testing is set up has some flaws. Drag racing is a big part of the game. There's a test track with a drag strip. So far so good. What's not so good is that you have to exit the garage, drive around the outer ring circuit a while and turn onto the drag strip to make a pass and you can't make any adjustments to the car on the test track. So tuning your setup to optimise your drag racing quickly becomes very irritating. Change one front suspension setting...exit garage...drive around ring...make a pass...return to garage...change the setting again...exit garage...drive around ring...make a pass...return to garage...etc. By the way, if you try the mile time on the test track with all but the slowest cars you will run out of track before you can brake and you will ram a wall and you will do a lot of damage, probably destroying your engine. That was the cause of one of my forced game restarts.Bugs. So bugged that it's worth mentioning twice. This is not a finished game (and it's clearly stated as being unfinished and unstable).But I've still enjoyed it for dozens of hours (I usually play offline, so my time on record is a small part of my actual playtime) and I still recommend it despite the bugs and the rubbish testing setup and the bugs and the bugs. There really are a lot of bugs.Imagine a beautiful piece of complex jewellery that has been dug out of the remains of a medieval sewer. A curator is carefully cleaning and restoring it and that will take time. You can see the quality of the piece even though it's still pretty badly encrusted with the dried faeces that is being painstakingly removed. That's SLRR at the moment."

Main problems include dumbass AI that always steer into you(atleast in my case), random crashes, sketchy driving physics, and rather steep learning curve if you don't know about cars. BUT, You start out with nothing and $20,000 to spend. Most cars you'll find will be rather crap, but if you drive right and spend right you'll end up with a beast of a machine. The paint booth deserves the most mention, though the decals are rather low res the paint aspect is really detailed. Overall I recommend this game if you really love modding cars. Especially for 8 bucks."

The guys that are working on it now have made it crash a lot less. For every 10 on the old 2.2.1 version there would be one now. They also have posted pictures of remodels that they are working on and even have shown clips of multiplayer.The best way to decide if you want this game is to download the original free version from either Vstanced or GOMteam called SLRRMWMCOMPILATION2011STAGE1.

You have to imagine purchasing this game as a long term investment. The devs are hard at work trying to make the game more stable than it ever was and the more people buy this game, the more resources they will have to make it better.Some might say this game should be on Greenlight, but I don't agree. The game was fully released when it came out, the devs improved on it, and the game didn't go backwards so it's still a full release title. Furthermore, if this game was on Greenlight, some people might think the devs ripped the original game and just put it up for sale without doing anything, since Greenlight is hard to enforce on that aspect. With this being a full release title you can be sure it's gotten a lot of work into it and Invictus and Activision have agreed on giving the game out on Steam.Overall my verdict is that this game is and always has been the best ""Built not Bought Simulator"" out there and it's gotten a lot of improvement from the old free version.

This game is for you. The game has an insane amount of customization, damn good physics for a 10+ year old game, heightened sense of realism wwhen racing due to the constant fear of crashing and having to repair the car you worked hours on just to build from the ground up, and best of all the mod community for this game is insanely large with tons of mods for this particular game (not on steam workshop, however). Youre racing and happen to crash into a tree? Prepare to take off that fender, that door, replace the headlight, inspect your engine for damaged parts, replace the cracked windshield, buy new rims, tires etc. Still want to crash? Nope. Just like real life, in a way. That being said, even if you dont crash your car, this game crashes itself. Often. It is most likely the most unstable game i have ever played. Bugs left and right, almost feels unfinished in a way. Does that stop me from loving this game? Hell no. Just save VERY often and be prepared at any moment for it to crash.

I love when i hit my car into something, it damage its parts, Then i fix it by replacing or fixing the parts if it still eligible to use.This game also helps me learn car mechanics. Such as changing crankshaft and conrods will allow me to set higher rpm redlines. Mixing A:F ratio gives maximum performance if it adjusted correctly. Adjusting cams also allows engine to have higher torque and power. Sadly there's still some things missing in this game, camber, toe, sway bars, spring, shock adjustments, steering ratio, aerodynamics adjustments, and brake adjustments. I know this is an almost 14 years old game, but adding those will make it more and more realistic. Handling physics is okay.Game performance tho is quite bad, Crashes (at start, sometimes in the middle of the game), bugs, glitches, slow downs. But i get that. UI also feels buggy and slow, especially on the main menu. I hope this will get improved alongside updates.UPDATE : Runs pretty well now. But crashes are still there, But not as frequent.Racing is.. well, rather boring. I want to race in circuits with many opponents and be able to configure race options. I want to select specified cars but there are no such things. Maybe you should consider that in the future. Drag races kinda glitched out, such as opponent will hit me from the rear and blow my car into pieces, Uneven drag strip ( why would i drag over hilly roads, had to slowdown to avoid accident). Other race types like derby and drift works good, just the derby needs little polishing.Mod support is awesome here, followed by the awesome community who made this game keep alive. Never messed with a mod btw :(Street Legal Racing Redline is suitable for those who wants to learn about cars, learning to drive in virtual city (although there are many better options), racing in circuits and modifying cars. Really fun game yes, in fact i spent many hours in this game almost every day. But the flaws in this game forced it to get 7.5/10 from me. Well i think that's all. I want to continue playing after this :D"

One of the really big things that affect my opinion on this game is that its stability. This game's stability is absolutely terrible and thus is why I cannot recommend this game BUT if I could run this game for 3 hours and not have it crash once instead of having it crash 12 times I would love to recommend this game. If you are one of those people who like fancy graphics you won't be very satisfied.Secondly I really think some people don't take this game serious enough because you will need some more than basic knowledge of vehicles than the average person. In the game there isn't really a tutorial that shows you how to put engines together and if you are like me you just did stuff trial and error which is time consuming and will  give you a head each. A really big thing in this game that made me salty was the AI, the AI seems like it would go out of its way just to crash into you to give you a bad time. One of my salties moments was when I was driving my car around the city just to explore and when I was stopped at a red light the car behind me rammed into my back, pushed me into the ongoing traffic and absolutely destroyed my car that I spent so long trying to get to work. I really didn't think this game was still being developed due to its age but the devs are still going at it to this day and I appreciate that and the fact that they are trying to work out the stability issues which is good.This concludes my mixed feelings/passive aggressive review about this interesting game."

But the balance in the drag races is awful, 1 minute you can pull a win against a pretty stylish high powered street car in a cheap beater, next minute you get slapped in the chops by a hatchback when you're in a ferrari with a V10... Drag racing balance is bad and so's the prizes you get from drag races, and as for race track races, could never get into them due to the overly harsh restrictions on cars.Plus the overbundance of crashes, go into my garage happy that i just managed to peel off a victory that was close as hell, only to find out i got nothing from it because the game crapped it's pants and crashed. Whether it be mid race or going to the garage. Crashes alllll the time. And. The worst part...Settings, never save... Turning autosave off, then all of a sudden, it saved when i didn't expect it when i bashed my car into a wall and lost it, which ended the career.So... For now. I don't recommend this game. If it got more updates, more cars, crash fixes and BALANCE. Then i'd recommend. Sorry devs...---------------------------------------UPDATE--------------------------------------An update deleted my save game where i actually made some progress and to top it off it was a ""stability"" update which made the game a whole lot less stable.

After skipping ahead several days to find the perfect car at the dealer, I puchased a Supra clone for 14000. The car was well equipped with nitrous and an aftermarket hood. It also came with one headlight, one tail light, a rear bumper, and a partial suspension... under the front left. I was able to afford a full suspension and three additional wheels, and thought I was ready to race. It was about that time I realized the car had no driver seat and I was out of money. I had to sell my fancy, non matching, hood to buy a seat and go street racing. Obviously the first few racers I honked at were intimidated by my radical weight reductions but I earned enough money to go night racing. Night time drag racing is where the game really comes to life and you make some money. I built up my car to 1121hp and put massive drag tires under it without wasting money on fancy body panels because doors are for the weak. What is more exciting than body panels?... Third gear wheelies!Overall, I would say this game is well worth the money. I enjoyed that I could mess with tuning and swap out internal engine parts to squeeze all the power I could from an engine. If you don't have technical knowledge of cars, I think the game still makes things simple enough to teach you through it. I think this game can grow to have a huge following so give it a chance."

Now you can progress without cheating, you actually get to use your cars against something. Crashes are way down when comparing it to the other versions.It's frustrating at times, for example when hitting the curb absolutely destroys your vehicle or when a car pops up in front of you, similar unexpected stuff, but it's part of the charm.This version still supports mods (you can get some on gom-team) and if I'm correct the dev is working on workshop support.I would recommend installing MrSirs running gear and some wheels + tyre mod from vstancedIf you like building cars you should definetly get this."

It wouldn't be that good of a game if it was just a racing game, but you can change your car however you like. Want to save weight? just take some seats out. Too slow? Build a better engine. Want to go race it in the city? Go right ahead. Crashed it into a police car and destroyed everything but the chassis? Have fun rebuilding it.Do keep in mind that the game is far from polished. If you damage your car and can't repair it your run is pretty much over, you can still sell your car and get some money for a new one, but you'll be too slow to keep up. Learning how to play is difficult too if you don't look up some tutorials.The thing I like so much about this game is the fact that there's so much stuff in it. A few examples:-Drag racing (cash or pink slip)-Racing-Engine/car building-Freeroaming-Store several cars-Damage model-Police chases-1st person cameraHere are some cons listed too. Some of these can be quite game breaking but these are easily fixable-After a drag race your brakes just get slammed by the game, this can cause you to crash into your opponent or the scenery completly destroying your car ( and wasting the money won)-The police can't keep up with the higher end cars-The game launcher and settings do act quite weird (resetting resolution, tabbing out on launch, Hud numbers not where they're supposed to be (speed and gear are in the black part of the speedo and unreadable)-Some wheels not supported (G29 for example)-Dashboard speedo is extremly inaccurateThis is my first ""real"" review so criticism is appreciated."

Still awkward, as any keyboard will be with a racing game because of the imprecise input, but the best I have seen.That said, this game can be considered somewhere between the alpha and beta stage. Waiting to see how things turn out later would not be a bad idea, and what exists at the moment of writing this is rather limited. However, this game is going in an exciting direction using one of my all-time favorite game engines. Worth serious consideration to racing fans, but beware of bugs and unimpressive graphics for the time being."

A bit tough to figure out in the beginning due there being no tutorial, but after that it's cool to be able to customize so many parts of the car in great detail. Only problem so far was the second time I opened the game, the resolution got set to minimum and the text was giant and almost impossible to press. If this happens to you, just try to go to the settings and reset the resolution and then restart the game. Game may be a bit buggy and tough to figure out, but I have a feeling I'll be enjoying it in the future.(Edit)4 hours or so after downloading the game, I tried to launch it again, this time with a mod car installed. The game now crashes whenever I try to enter a race or the free roam area. Not sure if the crashing is directly correlated with installing mods, but there is a chance. Changing my review to not recommended due to this. Hopefully this might get fixed in a future update.(Edit #2)I looked at the error.log (don't know why I didn't do so earlier) and I saw the game was attempting to call a class file from a mod I had deleted. Since the file was deleted, the game would crash. I did a clean install of the game and was able to get it working again.

Played it for the first ten hours, resisting the mod-bug, until I finally snapped and spend several hours browsing Vstanced and other sites looking for vehicle and engine mods. After those several hours, it crashes lots, and especially on the chassis menu (mod's fault, not game problem). The devs have been putting in work on getting the game stable since it dropped on steam, huge applause to them.PROS:can run on literally ♥♥♥♥ing any computer from 2003 onwards: very, very low requirementsHUGE modding support from both external websites and steam workshopVery fun to waste an hour building a car, then crashing into a wall and losing the engine.

And freezing.Go onto a curb with lowered suspension and lose your front bumper.Engines have wings. (crash into anything at 50+ mph and it flies out. (this can possibly be rectified in the game's settings, there is a slider to tone down or up the destruction to cars, I personally haven't touched it.)The graphics (game is from 2003)Soundtrack can get repetitive (What about the forest?

Driving home to save after every 2-3 wins wears on you. Probably solved right now as I have not had crashes recently.2. Main Menu is awful. It has animation and it's slow. Just bring back menu where I can just click with mouse not where i have to scroll through with direction keys. Even other menus should be revamped, they feel awkward and need better UX/UI design.3. Somewhat slow developer. There have been 3 month hiatuses in the updates. I can understand but there havent been that much progression really.What this game offers? Basically you buy a car, tune it, drive dragraces, win money, buy new car, repeat. Basically all the car stuff here are detailed. You can tune the air/fuel mixture. Change gear rations to get better 0-100kmh times and so."

(BTW I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game and all my progress and it still didn,t work.) PLZ HELP....."
