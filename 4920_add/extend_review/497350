I finished the game after 5-10 mins of meaningless running. Also really bad voice acting. Graphics might look good for it's price but thats all it has. The game begins in a tunnel where we hear a car crash, then we run for 5 minutes to find the car, oh that must be my car, thanks for playing."
,Not Recommended,497350,24765903,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,[slckr]robilar5500,"Alright, Conclusion is done and dusted. Conclusion itself is basically a very short walking simulator. Some of the steam reviews claim it took 5 minutes to complete. That is definitely not tru. You simply cant alk fast enough in the game for that to be a reality. About a half hour with examining all the items and taking in some scenery is more accurate.StoryThis game is all about alcoholism. Unfortunately, I couldnt really tell what the narration was trying to say as all the voice work was muddy beyond comprehension. However, from the pieces of your car found, the bloodstained and broken bicycle and gravestone, bottles of alcohol, and the handful of notes you can read, I'd say somebody hit a bicyclist and then crashed, possibly to their own death. That is what I assume at this point anyway. Perhaps the audio will get cleaned up at some point and we will get better clarity on the topic.As it stands, the story was negligible and would rate about a 3 out of 10GameplayThe gameplay in Conclusion is consistent with most walking simulators. Walk around, jump here and there, and examine the occasional object/page note. So, that all checks out.However, there is no cursor or anything indicating when you are in the proper position to pick something up, and some of the objects I encountered were frustratingly difficult to actually pick up and examine (if I was able to at all). Having some sort of reticule woudl have been ideal.Additionally, there was an aggravating amount of screen tearing and stuttering. This game was incredibly poorly optimized. This was already obvious given the 10+ gb file size, but it was in full evidence throughout my play through. Moving forward/backward was fine, but once you started actually looking around, and especially if you are moving and looking around, you were confronted head on with the poor optimization. Not the best use of the Unity engine by any srtetch of the imagination.There was also an interesting dynamic where you could explore freely to one side of the road consistently, but not the other. So...feel free to explore one side of the map. We dont really want you to see what's hiding on the other side though.Again, I feel the gameplay in Conclusion was subpar for this genre or any other. A 4 out of 10 in this category seems appropriate.GraphicsThe graphics in Conclusion were by far and away the high point of this game. Conclusion is a beautiful game. I took many screenshots in my play through that could easily be used in monthly Steam competitions and woudl make very nice wallpaper/background shots as well. The developers dont have the mastery of the Unity engine that you see with games like Dear Esther or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, but they did a good job making the world seem vibrant and aliveI think a 7.5 out of 10 is an papropriate rating for the graphics in ConclusionSoundThe audio in Conclusion was poor at best. The ambient sounds such as your footsteps, for example, were poor stock samples from what I can tell, and the voice acting was muddled beyond comprehension.This was perhaps Conclusion's greatest failing, as you really need to be able to hear the voice acting to have the story fully revealed to you (or so I imagine, not having been able to determine what was being said enough to know if it really had anything to do with the game or not)This was a 1 out of 10.VerdictUltimately, for a sub $1 game, your expectations should probably be tempered a bit going in, but that doesnt excuse some of the glaring deficiencies in this game. At the very least, the developers should have includede a reticule and the audio tracks should have been clear rather than muddled and indistinct. Especially considering the file size, which is actually larger than a lot of AAA titles out there right now, I expect better work. The graphics drove my rating up a bit, and so in Conclusion, this game deserves a 4 out of 10. Not the worst use of your time, but definitely one of the bottom rung examples of a walking simulator out there right now.I would like to add a note of encouragement to the developers though. You show promise. You just need to iron ourt some of the key elements to your game so future games you hope to release wont suffer from the same issues."

I think this is a very bad attempt at a Dear Esther clone.I wandered around an island, finding a couple of spots where there were car parts that had either mumbled voice acting or voice acting that was skipped by the fact that I was still holding keys it was hard to tell, but it ended when I found a car wreck & I suppose it was meant to be meaningful.I got achievements for seemingly no reason at all.I don't know if this was an attempt at Dear Esther, if it was or whatever it was attempting to be, it didn't achieve it; not for $0.60 I paid or for free. Honestly considering returning a game of less than a dollar, didn't think it would come to that."
,Not Recommended,497350,28474719,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,Snort Cannon,"Conclusion is one of the worst walking simulators I have ever played.To explain the story, would be a very hard task. You play as Nile, a man who wakes up on a lonesome road and you explore it to find out how you got there.This game is simply put a mess of epic proportions and let me explain everything wrong with it.Graphically the game is a mess. Almost the entire game looks like thrown together assets and most of has very low res textures.Now I wouldn't actually hate on the graphics that much, but when there's so much stuff on the screen which looks terrible and it ruins your FPS then that's unforgivable.Yes you heard me right the game is also poorly optimised. Once you enter graphic heavy areas the FPS drops to single digits and it only once entered 60FPS  during my entire playthrough.The voice acting is also terrible. The guy who does the main voice of Nile, sounds like he recorded his lines with a sock stuffed in his mouth.The game also takes 10 minutes to finish. Not even joking, once you're done with the game there's no replay value what so ever.The game is also full of bugs, one of which required me to restart the game from the start.Overall Conclusion is a terrible game. It's not worth getting on a sale or ever. So just stay away and do yourself a favor.Final Rating:1/10Pros:N/ACons:-Graphically terrible-Buggy-Voice acting is terrible-Short"
,Not Recommended,497350,24765767,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,CorvusCorax,"Whilst I appreciate that two people join forces to develop a video game there's no excuse for skipping quality control. I'm also looking at you Valve since I really do not understand why you don't nudge the creators of such game so that they notice they still have to do some work before the release of their game.The trailer already shows the horrible voice acting  Conclusion has. The comments your protagonist makes on the way simply cannot be understood as you can barely hear him. You are asked not to hurry but listen... if you wait before proceeding to the first loading screen close by you can hear the sound of a (probably) fatal car crash. Then you control Neil who has no idea how he got to the bridge and what happened to him.Looking at the various personal belongings and car parts along the way can easily make you understand what happened. The problem is that it all takes 5-10 minutes to get to the end of the level and while initially you start at 60 FPS the value is gradually decreasing. Alt-tabbing and starting a new game do not help - I've finished the last couple of minutes around 10 FPS.Also, the game is simply too big: you download over 10 GBs but for what purpose? Clearly, the mountain and other surrounding areas are vast but you only have one or two sections to be able to wander off. And for what purpose? I guess for obtaining one or two missing achievements but even those that pop-up you have no idea what you did for them.Naturally, the notes you find along the way are meant to hint at what's going on. Neil's life has been full of issues due to alcoholism. If only these thoughts were in proper English. If at the end you state the seriousness of the game and mention that it's based on true events at least take the minimum effort to carry out some quality control!The conclusion is that Conclusion is a bad game. It's short, unoptimised, does not know what it wants to be and as much as I appreciate that the creators - as they claim - will use the income for their upcoming game I'll make sure to steer away from that one if it is looked after in a similar manner.PS: That was a quick comment and comment deletion on somebody's part. I guess this game is upvoted just like similar games with same quality. Do not let the upvotes fool you - they are probably the friends of the developers."

,Recommended,497350,34140253,Posted: 9 August,all,Zazgor,"Conclusion was worth what I paid, and what I paid was 49 cents, and for that I'll recommend this, but that recommendation comes with an asterisk large enough to consume the observable universe.TL;DRIt's a pretty-ish game with roughle 20 minutes of gameplay, given that you take your time, with some of the worst frame rate I've ever experienced in a game, and a laughably bad and poorly constructed narrative. BUT I found myself falling into a calm and relaxed state while playing, as I let the ambiance take over (with the jarring interruption of single-digit frames here and there, on a system which can run The Witcher 3 on high settings)PROS:-pretty graphics, with decent shading, lighting, and okay texture work, save on the trees, which the devs seemed to have forgotten to shade altogether, exposing how bad some of the textures really are. Though some of the highlights graphics wise are the grass, which looks honestly incredible, especially for what I paid.-Game has decent controls, though nothing spectacular or inventive, though having controls that aren't floaty or broken beyond repair in a game this cheap is worth something, at least.-It does indeed have a story, as it promised, but that's about all the positives I can give narrative wise.CONS:-VERY poorly optimized. Throughout the entire experience I would never see frames above 24, which for some wouldn't be playable on its own, but the game can go as low as 5-10, which is unplayable for anyone, even a console gamer.-The only game where I'd say having no story at all would have served the game better. With voice acting which sounds like it was recorded on a stock-mic found on a 30 dollar headset bought off amazon, with terrible audio syncing, and actual acting that sounds about as you'd expect it would for a russian guy to attempt speaking english for the first time, which is to say he had the inflections of your average actor in a Niel Breen film. The story itself is as laughable as the acting, leaving the entire universe to be desired.Firstly, the narrative ends abruptly, and without any decent conclusion to most of the ""mystery"" it had built up. Mind you, this ""Mystery"" would be solvable by a third grader for who english is a 5th language within the first few minutes of the game, but that doesn't excuse the games unnessisarly cryptic nature. The protaganist can only be assumed to have brain damage from his car accident, for he asks very obvious questions through his mental narration, while failing to notice and pick up on the most obvious details that, again, a third grader could easily deduce without even reading the ambiguously placed ""notes"" lying all over the ground for no reason beyond plot convience. And speaking of the protaganist, there might as well not be one, as this ""character"" exhibits none of the traits which are placed on him from his descriptions in the notes you find; this could easily be fixed by the narration matching the way he's depicted, but it's so sub-standard, with such poorly written lines which sound about as unnatural as the amount of similies I have in this review.CONCLUSION TO CONCLUSION:This is a bad game for anything but the asking price, but at the price I paid, that being 49 cents, I would recommend it as a short, relaxing experience, so long as you ignore the voice acting, story, and just about everything else but the visuals and ambient sound."
