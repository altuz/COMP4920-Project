76561198027151353,Recommended,497400,24494293,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,P03 Cieve |Jsoc|,"Alright, First review (i think)1 Moment of Time, Is a hidden object type game where you take on the role of a helpful soul out to help silentville with thier troubles, It has all the standard features of a find game, pointer, hints, Some humor, and lots of achievements, Let me rephrase that, Quite a lot of achievements for a point and click puzzle game. A couple of things to note however, This game is a little different then most puzzle games - there are more puzzle with-in puzzles then most hidden object games - Where other games have one or inside puzzle, puzzles, this game has 11+ So if you like puzzles, You'll fit right in here.There are a couple of things to note however about this game - Not nessarily bad, just differnent, First Most of the item examples in it are from the other side of the pond, UK, and North American players might have troubles finding certain items. The second minor issue is that there are a few items that predate the player. World war 2 era can opener's for example. If i hadn't gone camping with scout's i would never had known it was a can opener.  Granted it is a minor thing if your playing on casual, however if your trying on expert (hard) mode, and are tying to finish the game with out hints, you may have to refer to the internet to look things up, Or at least asking mom and dad.I'd like to mention at this point, as with all hidden object games, expect to clock up some miles going here and there to solve thingsSome ConsIt's short. 3-4 hours on Expert. Probably shorter if your playing causal.  Granted the many, many achievments in the game will keep you going back if your dedicated to finishing them all.There is an issue with trying to enter the store room with out fixing the door to exit the train-station. If you enter the store room, the game will crash on and off, just for that room. Oh btw, you don't need a screwdriver for the door to the trainstation, i went looking because how labour intensive this game is. Just a heads up.There are minor issues with finding items just out of reach at the edges of the screen. Being able to minimize the search bar and/or drag or move the screen would have helped with this.Sound and graphics are what you would expect with this type of title,Would i reccoment this product? yes. It's a good example of hidden object games (i own many) I only wish it was a little longer. I didn't research the producer, so i don't know if this is thier first, or one of many hidden object games. regardless, It's only a couple of bucks in the steam store, (at least when i saw it) which is peanuts for an afternoon's entertainment."

Some of the hidden object scenes require you to find items that are just not visible enough to even identify what they are.  For example, a dark black lens for a pair of sunglasses.  It seemed needlessly tedious in some places.  Right now there are many new HOGs being added to the store.  You might find a beter game for just a little more than this one that will be much more fun to play."

Even if it's a nice little HOG/Puzzle game (I luckily succeded in completing it once), it is full of ""game breaking bug"" that prevent you from continuing the game as you can read in the discussion.  Part of a hidden object dissapear when you want it to interact with another to complete the ""final"" object and pick it up.It happened to many, me included when I restarted the game to get my missing achievements.  Erasing the local cache, uninstalling the game and reinstalling it after doesn't seems to solved the problem.  People are still stuck.The devs haven't even responded to the player's demands at all and it doesn't look like they ever will.If you're an completionist you should avoid absolutely this game.  If you wan't to casually play the game you might not even be able to complete it.A big NO, NO from my perspective.Will edit my review if ever an update fixes this  BIG problem.  Mean while I will stop buying from those guys."

,Recommended,497400,32353439,Posted: 11 June,all,Mr.RamiroZ,"Well, before us is the classics of the genre Hidden Object (hidden objects).The plot of the game is simple, but at the same time it is intriguing: The game tells us the story of one very mysterious place, called Silentville (Silentville) - it's a railway station where people disappear. Get ready for your final stop.To get out, we must make a lot of efforts: to look for useful items, collect all kinds of objects, repair mechanisms and solve puzzles.In all such games, the main difference is usually the plot, but here the plot is not bad and makes you penetrate the story so much that you want to go through the game to the end.THE NOTE! If you plan to collect achievements here, that is, notes:-Approach for passing through both difficulties is a mistake. Consequently, it can take more than two passes. It is recommended to pass first with a high degree of complexity, and then to a simple one. This is due to the fact that when you pass, on the contrary, in the game you can reset the achievements of the game. BUT achievement is given if you pass through the lung after a heavy one.-Video recordings can be considered a skip of the mini-game, because of which, as a result, do not achieve achievements for the passage ""without prompts and omissions.""Due to the very low price this game is available for everyone, with whom you can get acquainted."
76561198112866114,Recommended,497400,30827700,Posted: 29 March,all,kyzka,"I've come to appreciate two things about my future. 1) I am not going to heaven. I know this because 2) God would never allow me to be an angel with super powers. These points are perfectly made clear through this game.But before I go into that rant. Who should be blamed for a broken game continually being marketed on steam as a working product? The developer? (http://www.2monkeys.ru/) Which is a small Russian company, probably even a single developer who thus far has only made two games and is probably stressed for time, cutting all sorts of corners in his life like eating breakfast while taking a shower, doesn't have time to tie shoe laces together, so he walks around everywhere barefoot and whose idea of vacuuming is to buy a goat and let it wander free around the house. I say pressed for time because this whole game screams 'RUSHED TO MEET A DEADLINE!'Or should the publisher be blamed? (http://www.jetdogs.com/) A Finland developer and publishing company who advertises themselves as both extremely experienced and adequately staffed. A company I once was a strong advocate for, but alas after time and time again, seeing both broken products continually sold and casual games being quickly thrown together for market cash cow purposes, personally my faith in them has continued to wane, still I remain foolishly hopeful that they will prove me wrong and rise to the challenge.So let's start with the list of things wrong with this product...1) Nasty crash bug when you play the game in full screen, causing many players to play only window mode.2) Window mode unfortunately is inadequate and many hidden objects are hardly discernible in window mode making a player rely on the cursor icon changing more than actually spotting a hidden object.3) Sound bug which causes the game constantly to restart its soundtrack in a melodious deafening tone forcing a player who is recording to constantly go back into options and manually lower the music sound every time they log back into the game.4) Bug that can cause some items to appear in the same inventory slot. This is aggravating as it prevents you to use the item you want, if it is behind the item that is in its same slot. The only way pass this, is to grab more items hoping that the game eventually corrects itself giving each item it's individual slot.5) Back button is temperamental only occasionally working in places, many times you will be forced to use the map icon to fast travel even to places such as the room before.6) Half a dozen blatant spelling and grammatical errors.All these problems have been present since games release and as stated before screams out a product rushed to meet a deadline and start bringing in some quick cash.However on the flipside I actually enjoyed the game regardless of its showcase of faults. The game is a relatively easy going HOG where the hidden object scenes require you to do things in order to create or expose an item in your to find list. While there is a dozen or so hidden object scenes, there are also equally a number of relatively easy, non-stressful, no brainer puzzles which are simply there for entertainment purposes. The story of the game is about ‘Silentville’ a town where the people who live or visit, seem to be stuck in some type of time temporal anomaly caused by a storm which targeted everyone with lightening, whisking them off into some sort of future time loop which they cannot escape, but instead continue to do the same mundane things that they were doing before again and again.If you think this is going to be some type of exciting sci-fi time travel story about cause and effect you would be wrong. As always ‘jetdogs’ and ‘co’ rely on a cheaply supernatural gimmick where an angel called Loki who is famous for his practical jokes was summoned by an ancient ritual. Likewise you must call him back by orchestrating the same corny ritual and then he decides by himself to leave and restore humanity. WTH type of ending is that???I must say though I did relate with Loki. If I was an angel and had super powers that's all I would be doing too. I would just run around performing all sorts of practical jokes and psychology experiments. I would levitate cows and place them in people's bedrooms, instead of making walls bleed red, I would be making them bleed rainbow colours with glitter, I would try and collect all people called 'Bob' to a single location just to try and reach the world record for 'collection of people called Bob'. I would tie everyone's shoelaces together with the exception of the Russian developer who walks around everywhere barefoot. If God wanted entertainment, I would make the whole Earth just one huge MTV channel. That's why I know I will not be going to heaven. That is why I know God would never let me be an angel.However continually marketing broken products on Steam with no intention to fix is not a practical joke and while I did enjoy the game thanks to its animation, imaginative backgrounds and completely stress free puzzles, still I must frown at ‘jet dogs’ continued ignorance to product faults, cheaply storyboarded casual games designed for quick market value instead of pushing the envelope to produce more significantly developed, meaningful and wholesome games for entertainment and learning purposes.This one gets a thumbs up from me, now you just have to work out if that’s a practical joke..."

I'm somewhat of a completionist, so I intend to get all the achievements. As well as refresh my memory of things that happened in the game.I've already finished the game on expert mode, I assumed without checking the achievements that if I did it on expert mode I'd save myself the trouble of a second play through. But I sort of gave up when I skipped a cut scene early on... I've only got a couple of HO games in my steam library, but if there was ever a HO game that you wouldn't want to play a second time, this is probably it. I really liked the length of this game, and the amount of puzzles; despite their seemingly impossible difficultly. But the story for this game is... very boring, at least in the way it was delivered. I really couldn't be bothered to care until closer to the end where I didn't have to talk to many people to do any puzzles. Another drawback was the HO scenes, I was bothered that some items were almost completely out of view, usually being covered by the inventory bar. It happened more often than it should have, and I really hope that wasn't an intentional thing. The map also bothered me a bit, it seemed to not take me to the place I was clicking on a majority of the time.So, if you still insist on buying this game, it'd probably be best to wait till it's on sale. As it's not a bad game, but it's very ""meh"" when it comes to story telling and object placement in the HO scenes."
,Recommended,497400,24577297,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,blkcurtains,"Honestly I got this game for the price - .59 on sale. I don't usually play HO games. I was pleasently surprised. It's areallygood game! Puzzles within puzzles, Hidden Object with Point & Click elements and an interesting enough story to keep you uncovering more.My one tiny complaint is I wish it were longer. It was getting addicting!"
,Not Recommended,497400,25804954,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,WidescreenRules,"This is one of those times where I really wish that Steam offered something other than ""yes"" and ""no"" for recommendations. This game definitely belongs in the ""meh"" category.As hidden object games go, it's not awful. The main problem is that the game doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it trying to be a hidden object game or is it trying to be a point-and-click adventure game? In many ways it feels like it's trying to be both. When compared to other HO games, it was rather lacking in HO puzzles containing maybe half of what I would get in other HO games.Sadly, there are so many things that hurt this game, some small, some not.The achievements are not working properly. I played the entire game without using hints at all. Yet a few of the achievements related to not using hints never got triggered.Usage of many objects required multiple clicks - once to activate, then again to drag to the objective. Sometimes it would allow a single-click drag-and-drop, but that was in a minority. Most of the times I have to click then click again to drag-and -drop which is borderline idiotic.But by far the biggest annoyance with this game is that so many items  were placed at the very top and very bottom of the screen so that you just barely would be able to see the items. I don't know who thought that this would be a good idea - it was probably some developer who thought ""well, it will be a CHALLENGE"" - but this was by far the most frustrating part of the game. There are several times where objects were almost completely obscured by the inventory bar at the bottom, which cannot be lowered, and a few times where only a part of the object could be seen at the top because the rest was out of the frame! Stupid, stupid design choice!The story? Meh. The conclusion was more of a ""you have GOT to be kidding me"" due to how lame it really was. Don't misunderstand me -- HO games rarely have intriguing plots, but this was one of the weaker ones.Again, the game isn't AWFUL. When it's not being annoying, it's standard HO fare. But unfortunately this game has a LOT of annoyances. I won't say that I don't recommend it, just be aware that you might get frustrated -- a lot. For those reasons, I have to mark this as a ""not recommended"". There are better HO games out there that don't have the frustrations that this one has."

At one point an item can disappear without which you can't continue. Only you don't immediately realize it (can't save anyway).So, yeah, I'm bitter right now. Hence the negative review."

It has a few achievements which encourage you to play it again. Some of the puzzles are pretty creative, and the storyline is fine as is the voice acting.What really prevents me from recommending it, however, are the way the hidden object scenes have been created. The inventory and menus end up getting in the way of the pictures which were clearly done before the inventory and menus were added. This means that you're often looking for items which you can barely see because they have been covered by the inventory. This means that you're desperate for hints or you have to randomly click on everything - particularly anything at the bottom of the screen. This might be deliberate to force you to play again and again for achievements, but if that's the only way anyone will play again you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel.I did spend a couple of hours on it so it was interesting enough to complete it, but I can't say that I really want to play it again, even to get all the achievements."

The next thing I noticed were the voiceover's were clearly the same person throughout with no change of pitch or any attempt to sound different from one NPC to the next. Also the game was completely devoid of any animation whatsoever through all the locations[except for some within the HOG scene itself]. (Though to be honest, these are minor gripes on my perspective and is a does not affect the gameplay whatsoever.)Then I found some issues that could effect gameplay unless you utilised the ""Hint System"" (Which I usually avoid). Some of the object's required to progress either within a HOG scene or not were displaced towards the bottom of the viewable area and almost completely obscured below the games UI and without precise hovering almost onto the UI did you realise there was an selectable item. Finally was the constant issue with attempting to leave a scene with the selectable arrow not responding and sometimes having to resort to the MAP to get around. (These issues do effect the gameplay and could effect progression for the (achievements/completionist) unless you are aware of such prior.)The reason I recommend this game was marginal to be honest as I did actually enjoy the playthrough once I accepted the aforementioned issues.The story was ""forgettable"", the graphics and music were just above average and the HOG scenes were mostly combine various objects than your usual single selectable item lists. The puzzles were easy to complete, varied and some were actually quite interesting and extended throughout the story/plot. Expect around 3-4 hours playthrough time on average.Based on the current price tag, including achievments and cards, I would just marginally recommend this. (Shame we did not have a NEUTRAL opinion TBH)."

,Recommended,497400,29527305,Posted: 27 January,all,osirish,"A distinctly average Hidden Object Game, although there aren't as many HO scenes as other games, the puzzles are very easy, and there's a lack of direction that often leaves you wondering what to do next.The graphics are fine and the sound and voice acting good for the most part, but the story is generic and just didn't hold my interest. I usually complete a HOG over a single play session, but 1 Moment Of Time: Silentville took weeks! I just couldn't couldn't play for more than 20 minutes before getting bored and looked for something else to play/do. Eventually, I got around to beating it, over muliple play sessions, in about 3 hours, which is average length for the genre.Others have reported serious game breaking bugs, but the only major one I encountered is when 2 objects decided to sit in the same slot in the inventory, and I couldn't select the one I needed to advance. Restarting the game resolved it. Other problems encountered are achievements failing to trigger and/or not showing up in player stats at all. The click detection is on the poor side, especially when trying to exit a scene and trying to click at the base of screen, some objects are partially hidden by the UI, and clicking and dragging within HO scenes sometimes required a few attempts.About the only real positive for the game is the HO scenes in which most objects require multiple actions to complete or discover, but other than that, there's really nothing about this game that stands out and it's very hard to recommend it, despite it's ""very positive"" reviews. There are far better HOGs out there, even if you are a fan of the genre.

More challenging than most, even on casual mode - it doesn't hold your hand like many others do.Pros:- challenging- the hidden object scenes are more interesting than typical HOGs - you actually have to think instead of just randomly clicking like in some.- decent story - nothing special, but interesting enoughCons:- the map isn't very helpful. It an take a while to travel. I started using hints to travel to where I needed to go next because the map wouldn't take me close enough.- some of the items in the hidden object scenes are almost completely hidden under the list at the bottom of the screen. Makes it very hard to finish some of them without using the hint.Although there were a few frustrating moments, overall I enjoyed it, especially because it was more of a challenge than most other games in the genre."

Most objects are in two pieces, not just undersomething or inside something. And they are not dependent on solving them in a special order, which is very nice.Some of the mini games were fun.  Clever without being too difficult and there were serveral very unusual types, not just the standard ones.The Story was nice, and for once no violance in the story-line, which I appreciated. Just people making the wrong turning.There was actualy quite a lot of substance to the game.  Especially when you concider the price.  I've paid more for games that took less time to get through than this one.OK Stuff:The music and graphics and voice acting were OK and pretty standard for this type of game.Not So Good - to frustrating:Most of the time the Hint button would just drop you in a different screen - and then take forever to load.We have gotten used to a Map system that let us know where the next step is. This was very lacking.The Worst Things:Sometimes, and far too often, objects you need for the HOG were under the center Inventory strip - and that made finding them next to impossible.The map does NOT take you to a room - it drops you outside of a building, which you have to enter and then move to the different rooms inside. The exit/go back arrow didn't work too well and it was often eaiser to go to the map and then find the right room. Which was pity.Conclusion:Not at all bad. Not Artifex Mundi, but for 1/10th of the price, without being on sale, not a bad buy."

There's a lot of going back and forth, the puzzles feel rather boring and the objects often do not seem to be aligned with where to click (I've had some accidental finds by clicking somewhere that was visibly further away from the objects - and sometimes when clicking the actual object nothing happens). And just the, how should I put it, the overall atmosphere is super dull.One thing seemed to pop up often in the reviews before I bought the game was how good objects are gone from your inventory and then two steps ahead you'd need something like it again... I honestly don't mind it, that's kinda how things go in HOG-ville. I just shrug my shoulders and move on.Someday I'll probably grit my teeth and finish this, but today's not that day. I have to be really, really bored to put my hands back on this."

Recommended for the price/value.Pro's:- Music wasn't horrible or invasive.- The narrated story sections were actually ok.- Voice acting, mostly, didn't make me want to vomit and mute the game.Cons:- Doors. Urgh. They were sometimes tricky to open. Like you had to click them twice or more to just get in the next room. They also made a really annoying opening sound every time, even if yoiu just hovered the cursor over them.- The HO scenes. Nearly all the items were the sort where you have to find and use an item on something to check it                 off your list. This wouldn't have been so bad but it was really picky about objects, sometimes you had to click it several times for it to register that you had it selected! Which really slowed things down and was annoying.In many cases the item was also out of the viewable area. >.<- The journal, sometimes in HoG's I actually like to read the journal, but it was so oddly written that I didn't bother. Also the font just didn't suit it at all.Game length was only 2 hours even with the fiddly stuff."

The map navigation could have been better, too much back and forth.  The hint button was frustrating. It kept telling me to do something when I didn't have the items to do it.

Multiple people have encountered a glitch where the anchor disappears, making it impossible to get the nest and complete the last section of the game. The hint option starts constantly repeating ""there is nothing to do here"" because there is no solution. No way am I playing through the entire game just to get the anchor.

There isnt any difference between casual and expert. There are about 10 mini-games and some of them replay.

I had to create a new profile and play over again.Another problem I got later in the game that I couldnt get back to the previous screen from where I am currently at.

Oh the 12+ hours is more like 4; I left it on overnight by accident.  Others have done more complete reviews but here are some things that I noticed.Pro : they put the effort into integrating with steam where you have achievements - and I appreciate the effort; many HOGs on steam do not bother to do that.Con : minor control problems; sometimes I would have trouble backing out of a screen, where the ""return to previous"" arrow location just would not register.  There is a work-around when this happened I used the map mode.  BTW one of the worst rooms was the pond for this problem.Con : full screen rendering (my monitor is 1080) caused some of the hidden objects at the bottom to be barely visible; when I looked at other screen shots else where this clipping was not always happening."
