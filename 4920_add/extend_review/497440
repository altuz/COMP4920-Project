It was extramely difficult to tell if you can actually interact with the objects as there was no indicator.- Requires lots of hardware to run at the optimum framerate.I'm running a GTX 1070 with a core I7 6700k and I had an uncomfortable framerate on low settings.For the low price, I'd still recomend this game due to it's really high production value and awesome setting. Although if you aren't confident that you can run it, you're not gonna have a good time."

Not very intuitive controls using the tracked motion controllers. Interaction with objects is terrible. Not clear how to proceed through the game without dying. Short game. I kept it in my library for a while hoping for improvements, but have deleted it today."

The visuals are mostly stunning (with some bad textures here and there) and the audio sounds great.I tried playing it on the Oculus Rift with Touch and that really doesn't work smoothly yet. For me there was always only one hand visible (the last one i pressed a button with) and the position of the hand was offset and never at the same position as my real hand. Also the interaction with objects/environment is still really buggy & sluggish.I'd recommend the game to all Vive owners and i will continue playing as soon as the touch controllers are integrated fully.

Once I was able to find out how to progress and not die, everything turned out pretty awesome. I'm changing my review now that I've been able to get into the other 2/3rds of the game and see that the developers are going to patch up the problems people have with it.If you've got an iron VR stomach, this is pretty top notch for about 20-30 minutes. If you don't, then you should probably run away from this one (unless the devs patch it up a lot) - it shakes the camera intensely for most of the gameplay.I also really like just laying in the station staring off at everything since the game doesn't really push you to do anything until you press the red button.People that threw cash out for something like a GTX 1080 will really appreciate this one."

Short version, don't bother.I was already aware of the play through time for this, so that wasn't a problem - the stupid thing is that the issues I had are so glaringly obvious, and they weren't taken care of before launch, or even in a patch.Hands seem to rotate somewhere around your fingers instead of your wrist, and objects when grabbed attach somewhere to your hands local vicinity. Level of detail and texture pop-in in places is blantant (even when set at ultra), and in one place, if you go too near to an airlock door, the entire thing disappears to reveal a blank wall behind it.When you're in the escape pod, my head was rotated so that it was pointing at my legs, and when the pod turned, my point of view didn't - apparently I had the neck of an owl.The floppy disks are flat polygons instead of being properly modelled, and while that might seem like I'm being picky, since they're the only objects that you actually need to collect, they really needed detail put into them.Check out Mission ISS (Oculus Home) or Adr1ft instead."

However hoping to find more little easter eggs next time I go on.  Apart from the controller/hands/objectives bugs others have mentioned - I couldnt figure out how to activate items - like I could pick up the fire extinguisher but no combination of buttons or using the other hand seemed to make it work like in the game trailer.  Even so this is a nice little package for a decent price and gives a mostly unique and enjoyable experience.  Looking forward to letting a few friends have a try.  Hopefully with a few more bugfixes it should be grand for demo'ing.Personally I struggle with some aspects of this game due to my own vive controllers - the thumbpads dont press down on the edges anymore but the touchpad section on top still works fine - makes it nae on impossible to manueveur in this title though as its all edge of button pushes...so just a heads up if you have similar controller issues to mine ^_^"

In the young landscape of VR I believe it can hold its own among the big productions of the moment, and it really deserves some attention. For the price it sells for, bargain isn't really the word.

I believe there are 6 actions, like pulling a couple of levers, pushing a button, ""steering"" a flight stick and that's about it.Locomotion is questionable, personally I did not feel much discomfort while floating around although I imagine a lot of people will. What's worse though is when you turn your head beyong a certain point, the entire view shifts which is VERY unpleasant.For such a short experience, it has quite a lot of bugs. About three times my right hand just disappeared for a minute, and one time it was floating half a meter in front of me. It weren't tracking issues, I made sure to check. Grabbing things sometimes doesn't work.It does look nice and has a good atmosphere, but that's about all it has going for it right now.Edit: developer has since tweaked controls, so this review may not be completely valid."

If your looking for a 180 degree/rail type experience sure. But some bugs need work since they can break the illusion of the VR.---------------------------------------------1st reviewIt has potential but bugs are forcing me away.  A word of warning, this game comes in LOUD!  Cut your volume down to at least half of what you normally do if you are using the Vive.  Also, the hand tracking seems very twitchy, grabbing items and using handles is quite difficult.  During my last play, I finally opened a glitchy door handle only to have the door open towards me and pinch me between it and the wall.  Once I got stuck I was done.  Negative for now, waiting for the first update."

Also no way to move left or right or up or down, just forward, backward and rotate to get were you want, very frustrating and hard to do, creator needs to play adrift and simulate the way that controls, would be a far better game and feel a lot more realisitic and also reduce mothion sickness, got no sickness with that..left stick should be forward and back, straffe left and rigt. Right stick should be turn/rotate. With no ability to move left and right this is a nightmare to play and contributes to sickness also and removes emersions also as you do not feel like it is zero gravity like this. Adrift had it down to a fine science and you instantly felt like you were floating in tha lie this just stops when you stop turning, does not keep floating in any direction etc..Right trigger should be up, left for down. PLease play adrift and do it how they did it or at the very least add option to go up and down, left and right, this is zero gravity after all...and add controlller options so user can change what does what, i'm using xbox controller, i want to move with the left stick game tells me left stick is move also, but nothing happens ....left stick does nothing...I can't play in this state unfortunatley.Also no way of getting to the menu once started, have to restart every single time to change menu options.Graphics are good, want to play it but can't due to controls, forward back and rotate only is a very bad idea...fix controls and will be so much better but can't recommend until then."

The price is very reasonable even if it is a short game.  My problem is the game didn't work, I couldn't get audio, my hands would fail to track or disappear, I got stuck behind a hatch I opened, the game was designed for 180 degree seated experience, it was odd trying to align my body with the ""front"" of the camera since you can easily move around 360 degrees on the vive  but the game was cleary not designed for it. I couldn't tell what I was doing or how I ended up falling to earth?  It felt odd falling to earth, my legs were above my head, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be doing anything at that point other than crashing.  Imagine you open a hatch, no sound, all of the sudden your legs are in the air, the camera starts shaking like crazy, you crash, can't really tell you crashed, all of the sudden you are back in the air falling again, crash, fall again, no sound, heavy shaking and all you can think is ""WTF is going on?""  It felt far to clunky to enjoy.  As a matter of fact I would say it was a very odd experience, like WTF were the game designers thinking trying to sell this in it's current form?"
,Not Recommended,497440,30179720,Posted: 25 February,all,friedgoldmole,"This experience lasts no more than 25 minutes, visually it looks great but unfortunately the control scheme is awful and the plot as far as it has one is minimal. It supports touch controls but your hands are out of sync with the actual location in the real world, and moving around is awkward (this is after the update that is supposed to fix these issues).For what seems to be a game from a developer with a good pedigree this is a real dissapointment. I am not so bothered about the length, but at the moment it doesn't even feel like it was designed for VR, the controls and interaction are so poorly implemented it feels like they that were bolted onto an existing non vr demo. If you have played Adr1ft there is little new here, other than the closing few minutes which are kind of cool.There is clearly some talent behind this, but it could have done with a significant amount time in testing and needs far more polish, as it stands I can't recommend it."

Played with Oculus Rift, Touch controllers are still super buggy. Usually just one hand is visible and actually grabbing things barley works. The graphics are amazing for a VR game, crashing down to earth was spectacular. Although the way you still have movable hands while at the same time having static hands :/ It's worth fighting through the bugs just for crashing down to earth in my opinion will be demoing that part a buch. Maybe wait for a sale or bugs to be ironed out in the future."

Ambulating on solid ground is difficult to imitate without having infinite space to walk around in (an average room-size VR environment), but in zero-g your hands are what move you around the environment naturally. The game ""Climbey"" is a solid example of what I'm talking about. Having a game set in a space station with motion controllers could have completely opened up the immersiveness of room-scale VR with motion controllers, but instead they force you to sit down and use a movement system that is as unintuitive as it is illogical - in zero gravity, how am I just moving forward without pressing against anything, and why do I have a strong amount of inertia for no reason? If they could even add an option to play with natural movement in standing position, I would completely flip my review to a positive one. It's especially frustrating because I program in Unity and have already created basic movement systems like this with very simple add-ons, and it wouldn't take much to program - just make all border objects ""grabbable"" & ""climbable"" and eliminate all inertia slowdown effects when you aren't actually holding on to anything. That's the whole fun of floating. Once again, though, it is visually stunning - just wish the control scheme was more intuitive."

Movement accelerates and decelerates, with a little uncontrollable drift after every movement.  Artificial rotation is smooth and mixes with your own head's natural motion to create an impenetrably discombobulating nausea.  A long segment of intense camera shake topped it all off, and I had to bale about 10-15 minutes into my attempt to play this game.  I am writing this about half an hour after playing and I am still thoroughly nauseated.I have no idea if the game behind it all is worth your time, I did not get to see much of it.

Maybe different scenarios of things that can go wrong instead of just the current main quest. What developers have been missing in these small vr experiences is that spirit of squeezing as much interactive game play you can out of a few scenes to slow down the experience and make a longer game. That's what I'd like to see with this. Even going through routine checks on a space station.

Unfortunately too many other issues remain:The game runs poorlyThe hands and gripping of things feels awful, it's buggy and your relationship to your onscreen hands is continually broken.As the game is an experience the story of 'press the button' is really weak.Once the action begins it's uncomfortable and unpleasant.  It also does not look good.This is the only negative review I've felt an urge to give yet and only my second refund on steam.

On my i7-4790 and gtx970 it was also lagging a bunch, so that probably also contributed to a bad experience."

Poor controls with the Oculus Touch controllers and a the control scheme in general gives a poor experience. I gave up on completing the game on my second play through, as my objectives seemed bugged. 3 minutes later, I was frozen in space and could not move with my controllers anymore."

The graphics are gorgeous, the voice acting is good, and the setting is exciting. But the locomotion and interaction methods are awful.I'm using the HTC Vive and the first impression I got was that the need for an explanation of the controls didn't bode well for the rest of the user experience. My second impression came from that I became annoyed at seeming to move around automatically without reason, before realising that this game in contrast to all other games used the touch controls for locomotion. My third impression came from not being able to open the second door because my hand didn't seem to be able to grab the handle and move it except when from some narrow specific angle while moving in some narrow specific direction.I still had hopes after realising these issues, and continued on to the next room, followed the objective but again failed to activate the objective target, started feeling way too nauseous, gave up and turned off the game. Despite the low price I feel it wasn't worth it, but hope Quixel will take this and others feedback into consideration for future endeavours into VR!"

The art was great and for a split second I felt immersed.  BUT, The camera shake is awful, the controls are frustrating and it randomly kicked me back to the beginning without any explanation.  If this were the first VR experience I had, I'd walk away thinking VR is garbage.  Please don't release experiences that aren't finished.  Immediate refund."

,Not Recommended,497440,29973964,Posted: 16 February,all,Scott M,"This should be a lesson in what NOT to do in VR. I don't know where to begin. The framerates were so so so low that it was nausea from the get go. Even with the LOWEST settings, it still ran extremely poorly. The motion controls were so♥♥♥♥♥♥poor that it seemed like they were just tacked on last minute after they developed around a controller the entire time. It's almost impossible to line up with the interactive elements and get it to feel like your reaching out and grabbing something. Moving your character with the vive controllers made me feel so disoriented. The SOUND. My goodness, please please please take the time to watch the audio and give it some head room so it doesn't clip. My god. The entire ending sequence was so clippy I had to mute it. Fix the HUD inside of the helmet. It's so far down that the vive lenses just distort it completely. Also take off look rotation. In terms of the experience, I'd say it has potential but as of right now it's absolutely pointless. From the ""Space book"" I could tell there is a meteor shower that I guess destroyed the station? The player awakens and you go around collecting 7 Floppy Discs for ""Steve"" and a book. What is the point of that? Who is Steve. Why am I collecting his things? THEN After you collect the book the game gives you no idea what to do next and you're left to figure it out on your own. I had to look up what to do because I couldn't take getting any more sick. The computer guy tells you NOT to hit the red button. Of course you have to press it and it makes no sense. You hit the button which causes the station to just explode and start a colision course with earth. Ummmmmmmmm ok? So I collect this strangers things, then I blow up the station that I am in? Okay cool. Why would I be the one to cause the disaster? Why would you make the player hit a button that causes the already damaged station to start heading towards earth? Then, to avert the disaster you grab this joy stick and hold left (in reality I have no idea which way my hand was since bad controls) for about 25 seconds until a meteor hits the station. Yep. You blast out into space with a CRACKED helmet. Yep. EXPOSED to space yet I can fly back to the station using my thrusters. Yep. 2 minutes in open space and I'm alive? Yep. You get to the station and hop into an escape pod which blasts you out onto the earth where you crash land. You are awoken by a robot that has you in some liquid chamber. Yep. If I knew what the HELL was going on, MAYBE I could enjoy it. END.I am so so sorry for being harsh but this has to be the absolute worst experience of all of my VR career. I've play the worst of the worst on the DK2 up to the Vive but this is just horrendous. Not only is the animations bad, the controls horrid but the camera is DREADFUL. It constantly drifted. Every time something happened in the game it would cause me to be misaligned with where I should be looking with my VR body. Trying to fix that with the reset HMD button did nothing. The entire sequence I was in the escape pod I was looking backwards at a wall. After trying to fix it I gave up. The fall towards earth sequence has VR hands that I can move around, yet I can see my characters arms next to me on his knees. I'm sorry, but this isn't worth 7 dollars. PLEASE for the love of god get the framerates up. There is a reason Oculus will deny you on the basis of ONE dropped frame under 90fps. This is a nauseating experience with a narrative that makes ZERO sense. PLEASE do not buy this until it gets fixed."

,Recommended,497440,29969016,Posted: 16 February,all,Harvester of Sorrow,"Homebound is by far one of the best looking VR experiences I have ever seen.  Running on ultra with a 2.00 supersampling really made this game shine.  Absolutely beautiful.  If you have a decent rig and decide to do maybe high settings with lower supersampling the game will still look good for you.Controls are about what you would expect for being a floating-in-space sim, a little tricky but you get it after awhile.The whole entire part of the game where sh*t hits the fan was breathtaking and nerve racking.  I was so immersed that when alarms started going off I was in a panic!  I had to survive.The only down side to this game is that there are some bugs.  Some minor ones here and there like with your hands disappearing, but I did encounter a pretty big bug towards the end and if a dev is reading this I would really appreciate the support.  Basically what happened was after I got back to the shuttle I was still given an old previous objective to fix something, went to the item and nothing could be done.  I eventually found the escape pod, hopped in, a cut scene played and then it went dark.  I waited awhile and my controllers went crazy with vibration, but nothing else loaded.  I restarted the game but now I had no sound, I had sound from everythig else just not the game which forced me to restart my computer to resolve the issue.All of that aside! This game is fantastic and the price point is a gift and beyond fair for what you get out of this game.  It's a short experience, but one that you will definitely want to show to your friends."

76561197970684034,Not Recommended,497440,31261932,Posted: 20 April,all,James_UK,"Graphics/interactions are ok but this game or experience commits the absolute biggest no-no in VR games which is excessively moving the camera via camera shake. I played this previously on my DK2 and upgraded to CV1 with Motion controllers today.Having returned to this after several months to give it a proper playthrough and hopefully see improvements, I find it difficult to believe that the issues with the camera shake still exist throughout which causes discomfort even after a few seconds. This is extremely prominent during the re-entry/flight sequence which causes major discomfort. The way your perspective doesn't match up with your VR body in the capsule sequence again causes a sense of disconnect. I really cannot recommend this at this time due to the motion sickness issues bought about by the excessive camera shake."

76561198300211084,Not Recommended,497440,31452068,Posted: 29 April,all,freedom_eagle,This game had very bad clipping and would send you or an object that was needed for a mission off the ship. It also had very bad grab physics making you just loose the object. Overall this game was very hard to play and enjoy.
