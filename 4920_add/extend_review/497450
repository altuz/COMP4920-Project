I originally tried Zen Parade (Mack's Galaxy Gear VR app) at VRLA, and my mind was blown. However, this..... this, is something else entirely. This near brought me to tears. Its so beautfiul, and feels like love. Do yourself a favor and go meet all the weird and unique entities you'll find in blortasia. Jesus its so good."

Flying round the outside of the shapes is a seriously thrill. I could watch the small pieces morphing for hours. Please add more content and scenery. If you have ever had dreams where you can fly or float this is just like it . Thank you for producing this game."

This was one of the more amazing experiences I have had with VR. It will definitly be something will we be demoing to people and come back to for myself. Please make more experiences like this. I will thow money at you.
,Not Recommended,497450,29806429,Posted: 9 February,all,Bassem,"I am all for flying in VR through abstract shapes, but this is really barebones. And five dollars? That's just cynical. If you want to fly and glide in VR through dreamy landscapes, while weird music plays, for under ten bucks, go buy Lucid Trips for an experience that's ten times better.Five bucks for this. For shame."

Sadly I was left pretty dissapointed, It's not for me. I was hoping there would be more options or customisation but its just like flying around a big mixed paint blob in the sky. Nice textures and light effects plus the controller skins are cool but it seems nothing more than a basic tech demo to me. A 5 minute experience and not fun but that's just my opinion. It might be a bit better after a few pints or a smoke!"

You get out of it exactly as much as you take.If you judge VR content based on the effect it has upon you, and what it brings into your life, then Blortasia is worth $5 without a second thought. Sit in the centre of a deforming, living psychedelic sculpture and meditate, comfortable in the knowledge that this is just one of hundreds of many sculptures inside a world that presents itself in this way to only you.The thing that I love so much about this is there isn't a point where you can fully wrap your mind around it. The harder you try, the more complex and massive everything becomes. Until your ego stops trying so hard to understand what's going on and you can just be.10/10 worth the price of a sandwich."
76561198146417047,Recommended,497450,29042024,Posted: 5 January,all,sword23,$5 is a biiiiit much but at this point I'm willing to pay just to support people making something that's not a glorified cellphone game for ADD toddlers.Im going to definitely unleash this on VRgins to blow their minds.

,Recommended,497450,29093135,Posted: 7 January,all,Rafport,"Blortasia is ipnotic. You're floating in an environment full of strage moving shapes with iridescent textures and a very athmospheric backing music. There are cave shapes, so you can fly inside or outside them. Just this, it's not a game, but is able to evoke good and unexpected feelings with a sweet art taste. Despite the locomotion involved, it look to me very comfortable. Is a niche product, but I'm happy to have this one in my library."

,Recommended,497450,29086116,Posted: 7 January,all,IronPanda,"Really good, trippy experience.Music is well matched too but it loops after a while. No matter, awesome flying around to your own tunes too. Haptic feedback and some extra effects would be great but this is a great experience and brilliant demo material for $5"
76561197983325960,Recommended,497450,29116010,Posted: 8 January,all,rehman1,What a fantastic experience for the HTC Vive.  I played around 40 minutes on my first go and I am looking forward to trying it again. It gives me vertigo but not motion sickness.Well done to the developers. You need to add collision detection.

You can expertly move yourself around the crazy shapes, or quickly fly through the maze darting around corners - the controls and responsiveness just feels rightHas a trippy, meditative vibe.At $5 this is a steal, I consider this a must buy for VR.Some possible improvements:- music choices- option to fly even faster"

76561197971869721,Recommended,497450,29253932,Posted: 14 January,all,Stjohn909,"I love this!   Flying through amazing brainscapes is what VR is meant for!    When you start, I recommend you dial down the speed to lowest setting before you move.    Just watch the action in the structures for a bit, it's very relaxing.  Once you get your legs, move around a bit, then increase the speed as you get comfortable.Inspiring, abstract, and soothing.  Doesn't get much better than this!"
76561198042445257,Recommended,497450,29508344,Posted: 26 January,all,ericools,Good for the obvious states of mind.
,Recommended,497450,29364060,Posted: 19 January,all,Prominence,"Very relaxing and I love the art ambience of this game. The sculpture shapes and colors morph into new ones non-stop, creating a limitless evolving art experience! I expected the game to be entirely on rails but it's totally the opposite. You surf on a little slab that you are in full control of with the controllers (the controllers look awesome btw). You go wherever you want, even outside the scultpure tunnels themselves. It's a very smooth motion, no motion sickness at all here. Cool game, and a pretty good one to introduce new Vivers too as well.My overview:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE2cZKdRvo8"
76561198021674276,Recommended,497450,29345384,Posted: 18 January,all,snierke,Fantastic. This proves that VR should look beyond games. And that art and ehh... other experiences naturally fits in VR. Really good.
76561197996379723,Recommended,497450,29165203,Posted: 10 January,all,cwoodaus,"SCUBA diving on LSD is clearly a bad idea, so it's a good thing that Blortasia gets you all of the benefits without the mortal danger. I love this experience. Wonderful to see VR explored beyond ""shoot the zombie"" games."
76561198031951608,Recommended,497450,34676596,Posted: 1 September,all,bdgackle,"Very relaxing place to float around.  It is a nice place to just ""be"" in and move around it.  The flying mechanic worked, and doesn't make me sick.  There is a huge sense of freedom with this.  Also makes a nice demo for friends and such.This isn't a game, but if you are looking for a nice thing to just experience, this is very enjoyable."
