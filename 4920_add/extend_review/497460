,Recommended,497460,24711942,"Posted: 4 August, 2016",all,Guy Fieri,"Alright, so at the time of writing this I've only finished the first world, but I can already tell this will be a fantastic game. I grew up on collect-a-thons, with the likes of Spyro and Banjo, and I have been looking for something to tide me over till Yooka-Laylee next year. Fortunately, Mervils manages to scratch that itch just fine.If you've never played the genre, basically there are multiple levels full of hidden collectibles and challenges, and the main goal is to get as many collectibles as you can. In the first world, there were tough platforming sections, tricky puzzles, and a few combat minigames, including a great boss at the end of the 3rd level. It was a lot of fun, and I can't wait for the whole game to be available.There are a few problems I have with the game, however. Firstly, the motion control segments like the tightrope in 1-2 feel bad to control. I'm not saying they should be completely scrapped, just reworked to be a bit more forgiving and fun. Secondly, I wish there was a page for getting 100 or so coins in a level to give completionists more things to do. Speaking of completionists, this is a game genre made for them, and I feel that the game could really benefit from extra stuff to unlock when a world is 100% completed, such as 1 heart runs or time trials.That is not to discredit the game, however, as even though it is in early access, this is easily worth the $10 admission price, and I can't wait to see where the devs plan to take us in the future."

This game would have at least 8+ hours of platforming gameplay and is highly addictive, polished, made in Unity so you know its sharp, and really well put together.  Jump on it - Highly recommended.There are 12 levels (4 majorly different worlds each with 3 levels).  This game is incredible.. you have to get on board if you at all liked Mario 64 or  Zelda 64.  Sure Mervils wont be as amazing at either of those major titles but its the closest there is on VR right now, and thats no slight of the devs of Mervils because they have done such an absolutely brilliant job.  Wait till world 2-1... which is where im up to still with plenty to go.  Very cool minecart level.  This is easily an 8+ hour game with bosses at the end of each world im tipping (there was 1 at the end of World 1).  Platformer/collectionist/adventurers.. dont think - get this now."

But I seriously got to get back to it now....*edit*2 hrs in.... that went fast... well I can say this... Its really great. I have only beat one world and not even completely, with 3 more worlds,  character upgrades, etc still left I'm absolutely loving this game.Seriously this game is worth so much more compared to what developers are selling early access games for! honestly this coming from an indie developer is like a 9.5/10 (only thing being that the voice acting though good could have been a little better *IE the first world Dragon*)But seriously stop reading reviews!!! You got to get this game! BUY IT!!"

Graphics wise, it looks very similar to Lucky's tail, except with better enemy design.  Bright primary colors are the word of the day.  The gameplay will be familiar to, it's like a simiplified platform game crossed with a simplified action adventure game.  The stages are diaromama\your looking down from above style. There's light gear upgrades you can buy (in game money)  and fairly simple quests you need to complete  to get pages. Pages are what you are collecting, they are hidden all over the levels, somethings questing,sometimes fighting, and some times just getting to a doffocult place will land you pages, which you need to progress and unlock different gear classes.All in all its a good platformer/adventure game, Maybe not up there with the all time greats, but good enough on its own. It kept my interest better than Luckys Tail did, and I've only beaten 1 world so far"

Nice art style. Good music. Customisable controls, and overall a very enjoyable world. It even has full voiceacting that gets the job done. Only thing i don't like is the sprites used on some of the trees (moves with your headmovement) but that is a minor complaint. Higly recomended, even if it was 3x the price."
,Recommended,497460,25605722,"Posted: 20 September, 2016",all,fish,"This is a great game, and a must for the Vive in my opinion. As a platform game lover this game really appeals to me. It reminds me of Mario 64, with some elements of Zelda. The Vive wand support is great, al though I prefer a gamepad. Maybe the voice acting could have been abit better, but I dont expect that of a 10€ game. Well worth the money, and one of my fav games for the Vive."
,Recommended,497460,28473776,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,PabloPicanto,"This game is seriously a jewel among VR games. It fascinated me like no Vive game yet and I played a considerable amount of them. First of all the game's content adds up to roughly 7 hours of gameplay, which is, how you surely know, top notch in today's VR gaming. Given that you can spend a lot of cash on very short VR experiences, the 20 bucks for this one feel like a free giveaway.You play the game in 3rd Person perspective, meaning you stand in the level, controlling and following around your character. Your character's movements result from your thumb sliding over the controllers round touch button, which feels very smooth and allows precise movements. So you are basically your character's coach behind his shoulder, observing from above, looking where to go next.The game consists of 4 worlds, each has 3 levels and each has a boss fight. As I jump&ran and adventured my way through them, I couldn't help but get serious Zelda and Mario64 vibes.What was especially fascinating to me was how the developers brought variation to the game. Every single level tells another unique story. One time you have to help people gather equipment to fight a dragon, another time you are recruiting a pirate crew, then you go solve the puzzles of a mysterious temple or just have a jolly good time sliding down a rapid ice slide.The fact that every level feels new and has fresh ideas prevents this game from ever getting repetitive and you will wish for more once you have it finished.As I am a huge fan of boss fights, I was excited to play a VR game with bosses in it. If you like boss fights, you will find some delicacies in here. Keep an eye out for the boss of world 3, which was easily the most intense VR experience I had and, because of standing in the very atmospheric arena myself, one of the most outstanding boss fights I played.If you enjoy adventures, do yourself a favor and get that game. It is a pioneer in VR adventures and I truly hope, that many future games will take inspiration from it.If you want to check a few scenes of gameplay I leave you the link to my playthrough of the whole game, where you can check out every level.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYSo-GL7j5xrpgkToLJfEMe-lHkxWNGhG"

This game has its own unique originality,  It has potential to be what sonic was for sega or mario was for Nintendo in vive. If i could ask for one thing it would be for a new way to save. A save by stage or area.VirtuO'MEGA"
76561197980676841,Recommended,497460,25096801,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,VRtual Boys,"I have been looking for an entry in third person platformer realm since I got my Vive. For 10 bucks, LOOK NO FURTHER! I played the free demo, and after one level (currently out of 12, but more will be added), I was hooked. The first level was super fun getting used to the controls and enemy fighting mechanics. There is at least 10+ hours of polished gameplay reminiscent of Super Mario 3D World and Zelda elements.That being said, using the Vive motion controllers for this game will likely cost you more than a few hearts in the form of botched maneuvers -- half the time I feel myself wanting to use my Xbox 360 gamepad, but then they do include some aiming mechanics with the motion controls (firing Ballistas/Catapults), making it a tough decision. Upon using a gamepad, the aim controls are then bound to your headset movement -- UPDATE: I found out in addition to seated gamepad mode, you can do a ROOM-SCALE GAMEPAD MODE, which is one of the best experiences I've had on Vive! I can't wait for this style of play to be adapted into certain other games as well.After two levels in the first world and the variety they've demonstrated in the mini-quests, I can already tell this is far and away worth the $10, and I would not at all be surprised if the price went up sooner rather than later."

The visuals are excellent and I really enjoy the simple art style.  Lots of content here and great level designs.  I agree that it does sit somewhere between Mario & Zelda.  Great game!!

It's really fun, simple and colourful, and the mechanics are very intuitive, although they still need some polish. I think 3rd person VR is really great, surely it's less immersive but it's a good halfway between monitor games and pure 1st person VR.The only complain I have is the graphics which are too simplistic, I wish there was more detail in the environments.Definitely recommended."

This game has so much to offer and has kept me interested far more than other v.r games. It acctually feels like a game not another v.r demo. The vive controls work well and I feel like a god towering over my little world. I definetly recomend this game its a much needed change of pace for vive game."

HIGH QUALITY.I LOVE and value an in-depth adventure that provides variation and this one does it.I've played quite a few VR titles and there aren't many that have this level of depth in story, mixed game play types (fighting enemies with sword, shooting with arrow, etc), level differentiation, and overall length to complete the game.I also really appreciate Mervils' good blend of fighting enemies, collecting things, exploring masterfully artistic lands, and solving not-too-difficult puzzles (Like with games like Limbo and Trine, I love them but even after multiple attempts and going back and trying again over and over, I've gotten stuck and end up not finishing which sucks bc I enjoy them... if only I could get my husband to solve all the puzzles I get stuck on (haha).. but these puzzles won't kill you if you don't have a ton of time to spend on gaming like myself).  :)While it's a different concept, if you loved Vanishing Realms, you'll love Mervils.  Excellent work, Mervils Team!  (Seriously.  Great job.)"

About 1/2 way through and am enjoying the variety of puzzles and action. Some better voice acting  (or positional effects for voices) would improve it a lot, but overall it's a lot more fun than expected."

The concenpt of the game is to find pages across the different worlds. Along the way there are various puzzles that take advantage of vr. I found it best played in a seated postition. So if your looking for a game that reminds you of games like banjo-kazooie, super mario 64 or crash bandicoot, this it. A must buy!Pros:Looks polished (the art style looks great in vr)Areas vary with different play mechanics (including puzzles, platforming, boss fights and collections)Sound is great (Music fits each environment, voice acting is fun and is used quite often in quest or just walking near npc's)Early access, so you know more content will be added. Including 2 more worlds that are currently locked.Cons:Camera control can get some getting used to. I found myself with the camera behind a tree or a wall.Some of the puzzles can be a bit challenging, or at least they were for me and could lead to frustration. Just take a break and come back to it."

,Recommended,497460,24795562,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,Solar,"This is my go-to game to play when my legs are tired from playing roomscale games. It is a seated experience platforming game. You control a Mervil in third person (or first person if you can stomach it) and run around killing monsters and collecting pages and coins, and there are also some challenging puzzles.There are different comfort modes: my favourite is where you have the camera stay in place and you press a button to teleport your camera to your mervil, or if you can stomach it you can have the camera always follow right behind your mervil.This game doesn't use the motion controllers, so you will need a controller. I play it with the Steam Controller. Also, there are parts where you have to use your head, literally. For example: in one level there's a tightrope where leaning your head also leans your mervil.While I have more fun in room-scale games where I can use the motion controllers, I can only play those games for a few hours before my legs are too tired and I must sit down. And when I'm sitting down I'd much rather play a seated VR game than a 2D game. And this is my favourite seated VR game right now.I highly recommend this game because the price is very low for the quality and amount of content in the game, plus it's not even finished so the developer will be adding even more content to the game!"

There is something quite Lego about the cute style & levels, Skylanders in the gameplay and a good old RPG collect, upgrade and progress mechanic.  The actions feel accurate, the head tracking aimed ballista mini game is a great way to introduce the mechanic and I like the way thee difficulty ramps up in the next level.With the standard seated (Rift) 'blink' movement controls I found the VR sense great, the alternative 'always follow' mode gave me motion sickness in the first couple of seconds - I switched back and all was fine again.We've tried quite a few of the early VR experiences and they tend to be quite short, this seems to have a fair bit more content even in Early Access.The developer is highly responsive in the community pages too should you run into any problems.  Good job so far.I'll update this review as we play more of the game from both adult and younger player perspectives."

Not sure if this has to do with my dual GPU setup or what, but my primary monitor and Rift are on the same GPU so I shouldn't be running into any severe issues like this.It does work fine through Oculus Home but not through Steam.
