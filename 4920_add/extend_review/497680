,Not Recommended,497680,25025097,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,Cyril,"Technically this is fine, but it feels... more like potential for a cool idea rather than an actually cool idea. The game introduces all of its different pieces but rarely combines them into anything greater. Why can't we have the replicating mechanic mixed with the multi-player mechanic? That'd be cool. What about the portals, you could use those with both the replicating mechanic and the multi-player mechanic in cool ways. And the gimmick for the last few levels comes too late, that could've been played around with more than it was.On top of that, for the short length of the game, it really feels like there should be more to it. And even at a dollar... this is basically an underdeveloped free flash game at best. Technically its faults aren't doing anything wrong necessarily, but it's just not doing as much as it should be doing. I can't really recommend it, even for its low price, but I mean, it's clever and mildly fun for as brief as it lasts, I guess?"

I was actually really into it. Nice puzzles, even if they are a bit easy, relaxing sounds and unique puzzle mechanics, but as soon as the puzzles start getting a bit more difficult it suddenly ends.If you're looking for a really good puzzle game I'd recommend Hexcells over this any day. Much better value for money and infinite puzzle generator."

The whole thing lasts about half an hour, maybe another ten minutes for 100% completion, but you might as well go for it. I'd recommend other puzzle games such as Hexcells first, but considering the price, it's more than worth a buy."

I quickly learnt the basic mechanics (there are no tutorials), and beat the game. It was good fun for about half an hour and then another hour while I tried to get every puzzle right in the minimum number of moves. Good game, but basically a cut down version of ""the witness"""

I would have liked it to be longer, I felt it was really short and had much more concepts to exploit than it did. Overall a good game if you pay like about a buck, more or less."

,Recommended,497680,29262095,Posted: 14 January,all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","Short, fun puzzler for completionists. A good amount of puzzles that stay fun without getting old, enough options are introduced throughout the short puzzle ""adventure"" to keep you interested. The ending is followed by SPOILERS:puzzles that deceive you, forcing you to do the wrong move instead of the right move.Well made, simple music, bug-free, always a plus with bargain bin completionist games.Don't worry if you can't perfect your moves while progressing through the game, after you finish the game, the game will restart with all levels unlocked, placing a star at the bottom of levels that you perfected, as in finished with the least amount of moves."

It's a simple concept that gets twisted in interesting ways as you progress. Never gets dry or repetitive. Not hard enough to be frustrating or easy enough to be boring. Thumbs up."
,Recommended,497680,25080353,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,Serpent Noisette,"A nice little puzzle game with great ideas !However it could be much longer, the great mecanics we discover could lead to a much, much, much higher number of levels.In fact, it almost feel like they are as much ""tutorial level"" to teach you those mecanics than real puzzle levels, wich aren't really challenging neither.I think we have some wasted potential here, and i really hope that some (free) DLC will come, the game is way too short, but still good, it does not deserve a negative review in my opinion."

One huge con is that it only takes around 20 minutes to play. I am a sucker for simplistic games and that is why I'm going to recommend this to other, but please make it longer!It would also be good if you could change the ""esc""/exit button to something else because I pressed it too many times believing I would restart the level! It was a fun game while it lasted :)"

76561198143030878,Not Recommended,497680,25181564,"Posted: 27 August, 2016",all,blumenleere,"I liked the game; until it was over. It was over after 17 minutes. I didn't want to do it fast (Looking through the puzzles after having finished, I saw, I did most of them with minimum moves; and felt no whatsoever motivation to do so with the other ones). I played it on one day a little bit, thinking, that the puzzles would be the easier ones and looking forward to the more difficult ones.Then I played it today again and: it was over. The puzzles are nice. But, for a game that costs money, no matter how much or how little, I expect more playing. It doesn't feel like the developers even tried to use the potencial of the game to make it a challenge in any way. Why didn't they use the mechanics and ideas to make more - and mainly more complex - puzzles? It seems to be more the idea of a game, a tutorial for a game than a full game itself. And that's, in my opinion, a little bit sad. The games leaves me exactly at a moment I just wanted to play the game a little bit more. The 17 minutes I invested were the time to get me interested, now that I am interested, there is no more game!"
