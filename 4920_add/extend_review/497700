76561198140299850,Recommended,497700,25434017,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,foofaraw,"(If you 'd rather not read this review, you at least owe it to youself to watch the trailer on the Safety First! Store Page.)Safety First! is a surprisingly clever and well-designed twin stick physics game, as much a puzzle game as one based on dexterity. The premise is that the gamer must control a stick-figure character to fix electrical problems by using Magical Yellow Repair Liquid (MYRL) directed toward the damaged area through a tool hanging from the character’s waist. (In simple language, urinating onto sparking electrical wires to fix them. WARNING!! Do NOT try this at home! It does not work, and may get you arrested if done outdoors!)Certainly, the most obvious aspect of Safety First! is humorous irreverence. But beyond that is a genuinely fun game with 69 levels (yeah, right) and 34 achievements (enough based on failure to make gamers of all levels happy.) There are three game modes, two of which need to be unlocked by successful gameplay. Included for an additional challenge is “DRNK” mode, or drunk play plus German profanity. The best part of Safety First!; failure triggers bloody separation (or crushing, etc.) of various body parts. While it’s a difficult game, the learning curve is reasonable, and some quantity of really hard levels can be skipped. (All these statements are based on completion of only twenty plus levels in the basic mode.)Safety First! is a clever and surprisingly nuanced game in which a controller is strongly suggested. It’s a very inexpensive game (on sale for $2USD), and the first seventeen reviews give it a perfect score. Highly recommended, but seemingly with no great surprises either way if you like this type of game as much as this player does.Thank you."

,Recommended,497700,27687201,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,Bob Spigot,"Have to say, this took me by surprise.At first glance it comes across as one of those fairly hollow, youtube vid fuel, barely playable mess games. Buy it if you want a quick giggle... but it isnt. Despite being very silly the control of it is actually really tight. Yes the stick man can flail somewhat but how out of control it is is mainly in your hands.There are two or three levels that really push it as far as frustration goes, but much of the time it gets the difficulty about right and again, it controls well enough that many of the losses are clearly down to you. Whats more it gets you back in to the game, and is genuinely funny enough that a lot of your fails are easy to shrug off.The different game modes are interesting, there is a surprising number of well designed levels to get through, and it is really really cheap for what you are getting.A funny, polished, and challenging twin stick puzzle game, well worth the entry fee."
,Not Recommended,497700,29414040,Posted: 21 January,all,Frostbyte,"Safety First!isn't worth a single cent. I have played it a little bit less than two hours and decided I needed to get a refund. The reviews are really misleading as well.My impressions and reasons not to recommend itSteam suggested me this game after playing (and enjoying) games that would involve hard puzzles solved through physics, and I was really let down by what this turned out to be.This isn't a bitter review from someone that lost money on a game since I have actually been able to receive what I paid for this. I swear I have tried to find something positive to say about it, but the whole thing was grotesque. I have actually opened it three or four times and was never able to enjoy it.Let's begin with the fact that I tried to take it as a joke, given you are a stickman peeing on electrical wires to fix them, but it annoyed me more than made me laugh. Its music is unpleasant - in every single one of the three modes -, and your character makes nasty sounds everytime you use its ability.I am not against simple games, but I despise poorly executed games. The game does consider some physics laws (such as gravity controlling where your liquid goes, you not being able to have both of your feet at the same spot) but ignores other laws completely (you can actually rise both of your feet and fly away).It's easy to find better games at a smaller price. I wouldn't want this even if it was free. Go buy something else."

The developer then replied to my little question and told me the meaning of life, the universe and everything.  This game has taken me out of a long existential crisis and given meaning to my life.  I am forever in the developers debt."

,Recommended,497700,25424624,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,Polynomial,"I saw the early version of this game released at Revision 2015 as part of the games compo, and it captivated the entire audience. The whole hall was erupting with laughter as players attempted to solve the puzzles. The next day I couldn't walk anywhere without seeing someone playing it, whether in the main hall, down in the tunnel, or anywhere else.In this game your task is to urinate ""magic fixing fluid"" into electric wires. Your controls are something akin to QWOP, with individual control of the separate legs. Each level requires progressively more and more precision and speed. Feel like you want a bigger challenge than the traditional modes? Try speedy mode! Still not satisfied? Try DRNK mode, where your controls are drunk and German swear words are randomly shouted at you.This game is hilarious fun. It's simple, well polished, and silly. My only minor complaint is that without an Xbox controller the UI is a little awkward, since the control hints aren't translated for keyboard. Once you work them out (WASD for left leg, up/down/left/right for right leg, space = A, escape = B, C = cheat/Y) it still plays great on the keyboard though.If you like puzzle games that don't take themselves too seriously, or just want a laugh, buy it. At the listed price it's worth every penny and more."
