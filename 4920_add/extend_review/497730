,Recommended,497730,32759122,Posted: 24 June,all,fantomchoder,"Very well-made point & click adventure game. The game is pretty amusing/funny, lots of random references to popular culture, good graphics/sound, and excellent user interface without any frustrating points. The only complaint that I have about the game is in regards to the story which was good up until the ending (felt rushed and left me unsatisfied)."

I did not enjoy this game, but I don't believe it's a bad game.  You can tell that love and attention went into making the game.  The graphics and visual style is very appealing.  The voice acting is good, but the puzzles lost me.  I wish the dialogue was more in depth, talking to the same characters and getting new information is a standard trope in most point and click adventure games, and it just wasn't there.  Pretty much once you have talked to a character they are done; nothing more of interest to say.  The puzzles were all very illogical to me.  See below.It made no sense to get coins you put money in a cauldron and go back in time, and the time is magically determeined by a sign sitting in front of the cauldron and the money just magically reverts to coins? If you are traveling to the past what you do in the future has no bearing on the past in my opinion.  I would've thought digging up the suicide booth with the shovel or the crane to get a coin to be much more logical.  I also found simply painting the hot pepper green was enough to make it volatile illogical; especially when we could've harvested mushrooms from the cemetary or something.  I also feel like a story that involved trying to give his friend redemption should've involved his friend in more than just the last few minutes.Again this is just my opinion and I think it boils down to a matter of personal taste.  I loved Grim Fandango and monkey island, the book of unwritten tales and king's quest, vampyre story, Deponia, but all of those puzzles I could generally work out based on logic.  I'm not new to point and click adventures and love to figure out a puzzle with no walkthrough help, but I was not able to in this game; which took away a lot of enjoyment, but it was either that or bang my head against the wall and not finish the game.   I appreciate the developers wanted to give us multiple locations, but it feels rather pointless to have so many locations where you do nothing, for example the 3 goblins.  I do hope this developer keeps making games as we need more adventure games and I'm sure as time goes on they will only get better.If you plan on getting this game and giving it a try be prepared to use walkthroughs or be incredibly frustrated.  I do recommend watching a let's play and see if it's something you are interested in before you purchase.  I got the game on sale and don't regret buying, but I didn't really enjoy it as much as other point and clicks."

,Recommended,497730,30052184,Posted: 19 February,all,Laphin Hyena,"This game is impressive for a point and click adventure title.  The art design is awesome, and the 80s and 90s easter eggs from all forms of entertainment media show that the developers KNOW fans from all forms of communities.  I was streaming this on my channel,(http://www.Twitch.tv/laphin)and my viewers loved all the references.I was a little weirded out at this game when it started, as the intro is ridiculously pushed onto the player and things go quick and then the voice acting was odd at first, but it grew on me for the kind of game that this is.THERE IS A GAME STOPPING BUG!!!  and it stopped me playing this title (hopefully it gets fixed so that I may continue), but it's nothing to be alarmed about in the terms of the quality of the game, but it happens JUST after you open the back of the van and get in... they sit for a couple of hours, and then they get out and I went back into the room with the two ""Movers"", and one of them comments on how late it was... then nothing, no cursor on the screen to click on.. just a freeze as the music still plays, and no more voice overs play, the game just comes to a stand still.Once that bug is fixed up, I will continue this adventure with my stream.All in all, the more I played this game, the more it felt like an old 90s cartoon, bad jokes, and the protagonist makes sure to make it clear that this game is not taking itself too seriously, that's one thing I think is great about it.I look forward to playing more.  Here is my first Twitch stream, it shows the glitch towards the end!https://www.twitch.tv/videos/123395397"

Especially at Teddy Dead!!-Narrator is especially funny, great voice acting.-the animations are amazing tbh. Great drawings and setting!!Cons-hmm the only one con I can think of is that the inventory should be switched a different key maybe. Although it makes sense to try and keep the game controls only to the mouse. So idk if that's really a con."
,Recommended,497730,30076465,Posted: 21 February,all,Soulenite,"Pros:- So many references a lot of people should get at LEAST a few of. Even if you look around and listen to the dialog.- Skinny comments your stupidity and humanity when you're probably used to games like Freddi Fish or Putt Putt and such where you gotta click ALL THE THIIIINGS!- Art style was charming to me.Cons:- Pretty confusing most of the time. Again, click all the things, also try mixing all the things. I had a bad habit of not holding the mouse wheel to see what I could interact with.- Ending could have been a lot better, that's for damn sure. It didn't feel satisfying at all. Guess there's the post credits to give you an alright ""wtf"" moment.If you enjoy point and click games, fourth wall breaking, inuendos, stupid things, and seen a lot of TV shows and movies and played quite a bit of video games (or at least seen some let's plays) to understand the random, unimportant things all over the place, it's alright at the current (non-discounted) price."

,Not Recommended,497730,30022189,Posted: 18 February,all,[De~Yupuro] Roasted_Cat,"I could quickly tell that this game is not for me. The comedy in this game is not the style that I would personally seek out. It really feels like something that could have been made 10 years ago rather than now. And it does makes me wonder if this game has been stuck in development hell for a long time because of how out of touch the dialouge is at points. What I mean by that is the game seems to think it's super funny and random constantly seeking to break the fourth wall a lot and that alone is intended to be the punchline for many jokes. Sadly those themes are very outplayed by now so it just ends up being cringe worthy rather than humorous. They might have been good enough to stand as punchlines when they were unexplored but that just isn't the case anymore. 14 year old me might have liked this game ""oh wow that's such a random thing to say. It just came out of nowhere and doesnt even have a subtle connection to previous themes and that is funny"" ""haha there's a sex related item over there in the corner and the main character points it out how crazy is that?"" and ""There's the thing from that thing that I watched and or played"". It just feels so extremely dated in the worst of ways. I'm obviously not saying nothing in this game made me smile or that I didn't find it fun to look at each screen to point out references from things. But it all just feels like it has been tailored and finessed to suit a 2011 audience rather than 2017. It feels like an extremely generic comedy point and click game that thinks it's anything but that.The point and click gameplay itself is solid though and it doesnt feel as narrow as other more modern point and click games do. I would personally not recomend the game due to the off putting comedy but that doesn't mean the gameplay itself is bad. If you can look away from the comedy during the cringiest peaks or hey maybe you find it funny then I would for sure say this is worth checking out during a sale. It's hard to value the game when it depends on something as subjective as comedy. The only thing I could say that is objectively bad about the comedy is that it plays with a lot of overused themes and tropes and that doesn't really change regardless of if you find said tropes funny or not.Also I want to point out that I by no means am trying to devalue or belittle anyone that thinks this game is funny. If you like it then that's awesome. And I would have given this game a thumbs up if I was only rating the game on a mechanical level. But I just feel that the story and subjective aspects is what makes or breaks a point and click game or any story driven game that let's the gameplay take the backseat constantly or at points."

I was originally drawn to this game because i have previously played a game called day of the tentacle and steam recommended it as similar style. They were not wrong, this game, the wardrobe was up with the times and had a pretty good story and a lot of moments that made me laugh and really scratch my brains to think of a solution. I really enjoyed it. The only downfall for me was the ending was short and pretty crap.But having said that, i would really recommend this game!!"

76561198042479626,Recommended,497730,35191927,Posted: 24 September,all,BrambleLamb,"While many of the puzzles have an odd logic that is very hard to find, I did find the game very enjoyable. The humor and the references were something I really enjoyed, and many of the objectives were something I could get into. My biggest problems with the game are the tanked frame rate during cutscenes, often the game would stop responding during cutscenes even, and a couple of the puzzle solutions didn't seem to really make sense. All in all though, if you have $15 and just want an enjoyable night, this might just be for you."
