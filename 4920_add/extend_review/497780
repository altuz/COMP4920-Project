76561198013939830,Recommended,497780,26604199,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,snowyowl0,"A very clever space-manipulation puzzle game. Everything in Recursed (graphics, story, music) exists to serve the puzzles, so if you don't enjoy puzzles, there's nothing for you here. If you do enjoy puzzles - particularly puzzles with keys, locks, platforming, and green-tinted objects that are unaffected by your space powers - then you're in for a real treat.The core mechanic is this: when you leave a room, its contents revert to their original state. This may remind you of old games like Megaman, where the hardware didn't have enough memory to remember the entire level at once. An enemy that followed you out of a room and then back into it might be duplicated, while an enemy that wandered off-screen would be erased. If you've ever thought that would make a good mechanic for a puzzle game: you're absolutely right. Recursed is that game.The puzzles are masterfully designed. Many of them hinge on a single insight, and solving them will make you feel like a genius. There's lots of room for experimentation, and lots of opportunities to see how the puzzle elements interact that really makes you feel like you're learning the rules of this world. Even if what you've learned doesn't help you with this puzzle, it will almost certainly come back in a later one.Recursed encourages these moments of discovery. Sets them up, even. At least once in the game, you'll have a question about a particular mechanic, and you'll set up an experiment to find out the answer... and the game will reward your curiosity. ""Well done"", it seems to say. ""You spotted a cool thing, and I didn't even have to point you towards it."" (And then you get a diamond.)The game introduces its concepts very gradually, letting you experiment and master each one before throwing a new object at you. The first world doesn't even use the core mechanic, it just lets players familiarise themselves with the platforming and lock-and-key mechanics. Which is appreciated, because there are a couple of subtleties (the ability to throw objects, in particular) that veteran gamers may not expect, so they'll appreciate the slow start.The green objects in the fourth world are something of a turning point. By then, you ought to understand the basic mechanics of Recursed well enough, and you'll have discovered that some things are impossible within the game's rules. Green breaks those rules, turning the discoveries you've made so far on their head, making some things possible that were impossible, and opening up new areas to explore. But unlike the start of the game where you had no idea what to expect, this time you'll have a framework to fit these new ideas into, and you may even think of a use for green objects before you see the puzzle that demonstrates it. It's from this point on that Recursed's puzzle design really shines.With that high point in mind, I'm a little let down by the later areas. The new mechanics introduced are less obvious than the ones before - acid brings little novelty over water, and fissure jars are strangely complicated compared to the rest of the game's elements. But the new expansion The Oobleck Conundrum remedies this very well, as oobleck has a very simple behaviour from which complex and interesting puzzles flow.The final level is one for the books, as well. Everything you've seen throughout the game comes back for one last hurrah, a final boss of a puzzle that uses all the most advanced tricks you've learned. Yet it's ultimately simple enough that you can beat it in three minutes, when you understand the solution. Worth playing through to the end.The game took me about twelve hours to beat all-in-all, including the expansion. There's not much reason to play it again once you've gotten 100%.Also, after I did beat it, I caught myself checking what I was holding before leaving my bedroom. 10/10, would attempt to use game mechanics in real life again."

How they rotate and land at a random angle. I would imagine that the developer had a very specific vision in mind - and then tediously crafted exactly that.And while the ambience is great, the puzzles are where the game really shines.Definitely has those 'WOAH' moments that I felt in other well-done puzzlers such asStephen's Sausage Roll. What makes this title particulary stand apart from other puzzlers is the mechanics. Each element of the puzzle has its own set of simple rules, but mixing (and mastering) these rules can be mind-bending.Pros:+Absolutely unique+Quite fun, with the all-important 'aha!' moment where youlearnsomething really neat that you didn't know about the mechanics (in other words, they gave you all the tools upfront - you are just learning how to use them)+Outstanding artwork and music+Great controller support+Tons of content, and it's cheap+Mind-blowingly difficultCons:-Mind-blowingly difficultIf you enjoy difficult mind-bending puzzlers, this is a must-have.Otherwise, I'd probably pass. It's dense. I probably completed ~25% of the game in about an hour, but that was the easy part. Will I finish it 100%? Likely not, but I'll certainly keep it."

,Recommended,497780,25875198,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,polomi,"Recursed is a game of nested structures, patterns, loops, paradoxes, and of course recursion.Imagine a set of Matryoshka dolls where somewhere down the chain, one of the embedded dolls contains the first outermost doll itself again, with all its contents repeating, which means that deeper down it will again contain itself, and so on. Or imagine two different sets of Matryoshka dolls, the first one containing the second one, and the second one containing the first one, both sets interlacing each other forever. These are the kind of structures that Recursed requires you to construct in order to solve platforming puzzles.Rooms are chests that you can pick up, carry around, and enter in. By nesting them in other chests, you can shape the world by creating intricate entangled configurations that allow you to reach places otherwise unattainable.The fun aspect of the game is to make mental maps of such knotted networks of chests, and to keep track of the relationships between rooms as you change them. It is an abstract mental maze of endless loops and infinite regressions. And when you get lost in that maze, it feels like rather than being lost in the game, you are instead lost in you own mind, since you are the one making the layout of that maze as you go along.There is more than chests to the game, new gameplay elements are introduced throughout. For each new chapter, it starts straightforwardly but ultimately the concepts are pushed to the very limits of their imaginable uses. The puzzles are quite inventive and the difficulty can reach very high levels that will push you into extreme mental contortions.I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles relying on logic and mathematical ideas."

,Recommended,497780,25867120,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,Toothball,"Quirky little puzzler that gets you thinking about doors and rooms in a completely different way. A gentle introduction to some seemingly straightforward mechanisms soon starts twisting the things you thought you knew around, until you find yourself restructuring the entire level just to get where you want to go.With so much control it can sometimes be a bit too easy to work yourself into an impossible position, when you leave behind a crucial item or room, but each puzzle is usually short and snappy enough that it doesn't take too long to recover. Indeed, working out how to avoid impossible situations is often a big part of solving each puzzle.Otherwise, the visual stylings are plesantly pixellated, and the background music sits well with the pace of the game and never gets tiring. The sometimes helpful observations provided by a mysterious benefactor are quite entertaining too.Full Disclosure: I am friends with the developer, but purchased my own copy of the game after it was released."
,Recommended,497780,25871512,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,Norgg,"Recursed is one of those quietly ingenious puzzle games where each level has you thinking in a new way, ironically careful not to repeat itself. It's in the same delicious vein as Stephen's Sausage Roll and Braid.It's also kind of a game about programming but doesn't rub it in or get dry and repetitive like some programming games do. You don't need to think of it in those terms at all to get through it, but I see it as a cautionary tale about the perils of side effects and global state with the protagonist as a stack pointer gone rogue.Disclosure: I gave the dev's daughter a pretend ice cream once, I paid full price for the game though.... now, what the hell do I do with this swirly whirly thing?"

Each puzzle feels distinct and well designed and there are even secret levels with their own unique mechanic that aren't found by sheer luck, but by using the mechanics of the game. Before buying this game, I was worried that it wouldn't explore the concept of recursion to a satifying depth or that the puzzles would be too easy. However my worries were put to rest as this game was quite challenging even for a puzzle lover.I spent 15 hours 100%ing the game without seeking any guides, which both for the playtime and the experience definately felt worth the 10€ for me. I feel like a level-editor would greatly increase the longevity of the game, however the game needs more sales if that'll ever be a reality."
,Recommended,497780,28341283,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,wheatleyco,"Recursed is a puzzle platformer with the platforming being pretty basic and the puzzle design something very unique.There is no story in this game,it is basically out and out puzzles with the level selection screen giving you an idea of the game and it is wonderfully done. There is a short tutorial which you can read before you start the game.The gameplay basically is that you solve puzzles using chests which have the properties that once you get inside them they spawn a different room. Now the puzzles come for example with you basically starting in a room with a locked door and the chest having the key. You go into a chest which spawns a new room get the key and return back to the prior room to unlock the door. This is the basic puzzle mechanic and there are some very interesting puzzles designed around them. there are puzzles where if you submerge the chest in water the room gets flooded. The first 4 levels of the game are a bit repetitive but not that difficult and easy to breeze through. Then comes the last 3 level sets which introduces some new objects and those are pretty complex and difficult but gives you immense satisfaction on solving them. You basically unlock the next set of levels by collecting gems which are one each in the prior levels. There are also hidden gems which you can find out which are very cleverly placed and require some critical thinking to get to that part. The level design is stellar in this game especially the last 20 levels which if you are a hardcore puzzle gamer would give you immense pleasure to solve. i solved about 15 of them and the rest were too difficult for me. This would appeal to gamers who like logical puzzles. The failure states in the later levels are so abundant and one of the failure states leads you to a completely different puzzle which is excellent puzzle design.The graphics are very simple and include a 2d character that you control. There are hints provided by a talking ring which you encounter in all the levels. The hints are very vague and basically explain the new mechanics which keep the game fresh and take it to absolutely epic difficulty levels.Highly recommended if you like logical puzzles. The game's name basically is taken from recursion in programming languages and boy the puzzles use that mechanic in some very intelligent ways. If you feel bored after the first 4 sets of level do continue ahead as before I mentioned the last 3 sets of levels are devilishly difficult and require all your puzzle solving abilities to be used. there are certain mechanics when you are experimenting with a level and it strikes what has to be done is so rewarding.The only critism are the controls which are a little finicky with respect to throwing objects and stacking things which you would need to do a bit. but that is only a minor gripe. A must buy for fans of puzzles platformers who like extremely difficult logical puzzles."

I had to look up the solution for two puzzles (out of over 80 total puzzles). However, you don't need to beat every puzzle in order as there are always at least a few open to try.The puzzle mechanics are extremely unique (I can't think of any other puzzle game that truly compares) and will force you to think in new ways.There are also little bits of polish such as your player character getting dizzy if you mash left and right.However, one major gripe I have is that filling rooms with water is a major mechanic yet the water level is not indicated in any obvious way. You must simply figure it out by trial and error. Because the number of rooms in each puzzle is typically small (1 - 5 rooms) I never had issues remembering what the fill lines were once I started experimenting. But the design is otherwise very crisp, so this one oversight stands out a bit.Gripes about the water aside, the mechanics are very unusual. I would give more details but the trailer already does a good job describing the general idea and I felt the specifics were more fun to figure out on my own."

From the trailer I thought it would be simply messing with the chest rooms like a straightforward puzzle game, but the mechanics are far more complex.The chest rooms are all temporary.  You can take items out and then when you go back in the state of the room will reset.  When you're going into a chest that's in another chest (layering instances) the rooms previous to the one you're in will keep their items.  You can move chests around, take them out of the rooms they're in, put them into new rooms to create different paths through the room layouts... duplicate chests... put chests inside of the rooms they lead to...  The game quickly makes it clear that the chest-room structure does not work at all in any real world sense.  The chests are not like doors.  The rooms are not quite ""rooms"" either.Otherwise it follows the standard theme of puzzle games where additional mechanics are introduced gradually so you learn at a steady pace.

,Recommended,497780,34273468,Posted: 16 August,all,edderiofer,"Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about.Ahem, sorry, I'm thinking of INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry). Lemme try again.Recursed is a puzzle-platformer. The goal of the game is to get to the goal (a giant floating purple crystal) by solving puzzles. As in a standard platformer, you can move around and jump (three blocks high, in fact). But if you're holding an item, you can only jump two blocks high (you can however throw items horizontally). Already this is a pretty novel mechanic I've not seen in any other game; there *might* be a game I've played where you merely can't jump when you're holding an item, but that's just not the same. Point is, Recursed does some neat stuff with this mechanic, as it's the focus of a fair few puzzles in the game.But of course, that's not actually what Recursed is about. No, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about.Ahem, sorry, I'm thinking of INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry). Lemme try again.There are three types of item you can pick up: keys, which open doors; blocks, which you can stand on; and chests, which are rooms which you can bring items into and pick them out of. The first two are standard puzzle fare, but it is the third that's where the game is.""But,"" I hear you cry, ""Isn't that just the same as rooms being linked to one another? I can'tpossiblysee how that would give deep gameplay!""And here lie two subtleties. The first one is that since chests are items, you can also pick up chests and bring them into other chests. This changes which rooms are connected.But that still doesn't get at what Recursed is about. No, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about.Ahem, sorry, I'm thinking of INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry). Lemme try again.The second subtlety is this: Entering a chest does not actually move you to another room; it instead creates an *instance* of a room, which is destroyed when you leave the room. So what's the difference? When you re-enter the room, it re-creates the *original* instance of the room. So, for example, you can take an item out of the room, then enter it again and find that the item's respawned. And it is *this* subtlety that creates the puzzles in the game.Using this, you can, for instance, pull chest A out of chest B, then put chest B in chest A. Then pull another copy of chest A out of chest B, and put it back into chest B, into a third copy of chest A. Be careful, of course, because if you leave the first copy of chest A now, chest B will vanish into the aether, and cannot be gotten back (which probably means you've borked the puzzle).This unique sort of action in a game could only ever be dreamt up by a madman. Truly, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about. And yes, this time Iamthinking of Recursed, not INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry).Unfortunately, at some points, you have to think like a madman to solve the puzzles. That's not to say the puzzles are *unfair*; rather that they require such a weird modus of thinking that I've yet to wrap my head around the game. Contrast this with Stephen's Sausage Roll, the Best Puzzle Game Ever™, where the levels themselves usually tend to guide you towards what to do; the levels here are either doing so in a really arcane manner, or not at all. That's not always a bad thing, though, but it does mean that you'll have to experiment a lot more than most (and often don't really get as much feedback when you've done something right or wrong).Complementing the game quite nicely is a rather catchy soundtrack (unfortunately not a fractal one, but either way it's been stuck in my head the past few days), and some nice humour (""This green stuff smells terrible! I hope it's not poisonous. *deep sniff*"").Despite its lack of level signposting, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about. It is unique in terms of mechanics and brings a lot to the table in terms of that.While it's not as good as Stephen's Sausage Roll (because it's still the best puzzle game ever by a long shot)(SEE EDIT), I still recommend it highly, with the caveat that you'll need some patience to get through it.Also, screw Rolling Shapes and Soko Match (formerly known as Flow Match). Those two games can chuck themselves into a chest which I'll happily remove from existence for them, because they're that bad and I've mentioned in my previous reviews that I would slag them off from time to time.EDIT 17/09/2017: Having finished the game now, I can definitively say that it's somehowBETTERthan Stephen's Sausage Roll! If you are a fan of puzzle games, you DEFINITELY do not want to miss this. The main mechanic is just so rich and the secondary introduced mechanics complement it so damn nicely. And unlike SSR, chances are that this game is of complexity class Undecideable, not just in PSPACE!Also it has a level editor, so there's that too. And the free in-game expansion is pretty sweet too. I hope another one's on the way for the game's anniversary."

Having such a small number of possible interactions balloon into such a large solution-space is hard to do well, but Recursed manages excellently.Has that vaguely Portal feel but with a steeper difficulty curve.Also the visuals are really good for what the game requires. The model/sprite/particle blend performs its function well, and mostly lets the game get on with its business."

A lot of thought has clearly gone into how to introduce the different puzzle components before combining them into more complex puzzles. The more advanced puzzles are mind bending and very satisfying to solve (so far), and the beautiful music and lack of needless peril really allow me to immerse myself in the game and solve the puzzles at my own pace, something I greatly enjoy. My only real criticism would be that I want to know more, who is the main character? Where is she? Why is she trapped? Who is the voice in the rings? Though I'm sure all will become clear as I progress further..."

Just wow.  This is a simple little game with a very simple little concept, however, it will leave you pulling out your hair with how complex it can get.  You'll find yourself manipulating space and creating little quantum worlds, to pull off ""jump an extra 2 feet higher"".  About every level ends with an ah-ha moment.  Surprisingly deep game.  10/10"

,Recommended,497780,33170697,Posted: 2 July,all,Borealid,"This game is actually a novel experience! It's a puzzle game that requires you to fully understand what you're doing and why. Solving a late-game puzzle by brute force is just not going to happen.Creative and downright fun, Recursed often made me go ""huh. I don't know what I expected to happen"" after screwing up. It's fresh and not frustrating.If you like being challenged to think in new ways, and don't mind NEEDING to do so, this is definitely a game you should try out."
,Recommended,497780,33931401,Posted: 31 July,all,Darner,"For some puzzle games, when you get stuck at a certain point, the strategy becomes ""try everything with everything, and maybe something will work.""Recursed is NOT one of those puzzle games.If you get stuck in this game, the strategy becomes ""get yourself some pen and paper and use your brain."" Sometimes the strategy becomes ""play another level and come back to this little demon later."" At least once so far for me the strategy has been literally ""sleep on it.""Puzzle games that manage to avoid giving the player the option to brute force their way through difficult parts are few and far between, so when a rarity like Recursed comes along that simply doesn't allow you to turn your brain off when you're playing it, you've gotta treasure it.You've also gotta hate it for giving you a massive headache but that's beside the point.Well worth the price of admission."
76561198031478578,Recommended,497780,33962583,Posted: 1 August,all,Skitzogamer,"This is one of the few games on steam I'd say you should go out of your way to buy when it's not on sale. A lot of puzzle platformers can be brute forced by just messing around for a while until a solution presents itself, but this one is different. You have to think it through, and it does a good job at introducing to the mechanics slowly so you can come to understand the world's logic quickly.I will say, as a computer science engineer, I found myself breezing through the first few missions and felt a noticible spike in difficulty at world 4-ish. So if you're like me you may want to slow down and focus on understanding how the mecanics work. If you're not familair with recursion, or at least havent used it a lot, the learning curve seems perfect though so please don't let me deter you."
,Recommended,497780,34763190,Posted: 5 September,all,CosinusCarotide,"Recursed is a mind-bending puzzle game with fresh mechanics.The store page does a good job of describing what the game is about.The later levels cannot be brute-forced and require a complete understanding of what you're doing and the rules of the game.Oh, and a good memory or a notepad. You might lose track of which room you need to enter from which room you need to enter from which room you need to enter...Even though it was very challenging (playtime is a poor indication, I spent a ton of time thinking about solutions outside of the game) I never felt frustrated.I knew it was never the game's fault when I couldn't accomplish something, but my inability to come up with a solution.Finally understanding what needs to be done and how felt extremely rewarding.Solid recommendation."
