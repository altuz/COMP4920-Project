Each unit uses up a portion of your food while buildings do not.- New music for the gameNegatives:- While some parts may be considered a reskin the game presents quite a few different ways to play compared to 8bit armies.- minor AI improvements needed- ""Vehicle crate"" *gets horseman* (Modern terms for crates)-""Aircraft crate"" *gets dragons*- unit pricing may need some tweaks so you can't make a massive army without plenty of extra cashThis will be heavily updated over time since I have not yet played the a whole lot. I also would like to share that the developers from petroglyph are always open to talking and answering questions through steam and discord."

[CURRENTLY BEING REWORKED AFTER THIS REVIEW] Attack-Move is still broken as heck, as units do not have any attack priority, unlike ANY OTHER RTS THAT EVER EXISTED! They will happily attack a structure instead of units attack them.2. Idle defending is annoying. Units won't do crap to help eachother or themselves. You have to babysit them for every single thing, and it gets infuriating quite quickly.3. Resource-vehicles are annoying. They will happily ignore shortest route and drop-off point until you force them there. AGAIN UNLIKE ANY RTS!4. This is basically just a reskin of 8-Bit Armies with two new factions and new maps. I'd call this an expansion, but both games aren't that expensive, so eh.5. Not much strategy. It's more macroing and babysit the stupid AI.6. Opponent AI isn't smart. To combat this, they allow it to resourse-cheat on higher difficulty instead of actually bothering programming a good AI.7. Opponent AI will happily trickle-attack with its units like a moron.8. Basically, the game is made so you HAVE to play Easy first to unlock units and structures and bonus-units and resources and structures at the start. So you basically have to play through every mission three times unless you want to torture yourself.9. It's horribly unbalanced.So why am I recommending it?All in all, it's a fun game. It's a fast paced RTS with an appealing style (subjective of course), fun to sit down and have a quick round and it's satisfying crushing your enemies.But it can be oh so annoying at times. It sure isn't StarCraft II or Red Alert II."

This game fills that void decently enough, there is a decent variety of units.Cons:Lackluster Story Mode: One of the best parts of all RTS game is the campaign, it’s either silly or over the  top or just plain entertaining. It gives you a nice variety of missions that keep you engaged, sadly 8-Bit Hordes doesn’t do that it has a sentence or two written for each mission you’re engaged in with a really thin plot that I can’t even recall. I got bored of it rather quickly as the game doesn’t vary in objectives nor engage you with a proper story. I didn’t even attempt to start the opposite factions story because from the looks of it, it’s just a mirror of the one I played.General Thoughts:There aren't too many RTS games coming out these days, if you’re really feeling that fantasy RTS itch this game will scratch it but it won’t leave you with too much after you’re done with it, it okay at best. I think I’m mostly disappointed with the Campaign as that's the part of any RTS I look most forward to the most, and this game does not hold a candle to it’s predecessors in that respect."
,Recommended,497850,24868242,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,sam,"This stand-alone expansion type thing to Petroglyph's 8-Bit Armies is quite a solid game. It features two factions, both basic archetypes of fantasy-good and fantasy-evil similar to the original Warcrafts, simple uncomplicated RTS gameplay, and a cute aesthetic that reminds me of old browser based LEGO real time strategy games.If you want the full experience, I would recommend getting this game along with its twin 8-Bit armies, so that you can mix and match the four factions from the two games together in multiplayer and skirmish. The campaigns for each faction are a bit lackluster, with no real story, voice acting, or cutscenes, just a series of skirmish maps (beautifully designed skirmish maps, mind you) with different scenarios to play through. However I feel that the core gameplay is fast and tense enough that doesn't matter so much, even if it is little more than a fantasy reskin of 8-Bit Armies."

Unfortunately, it's not as fun as Warcraft III, and the campaign's premise is really silly, so there's nothing to be interested in plot-wise either.

76561198017382987,Not Recommended,497850,29074929,Posted: 6 January,all,Lydia XIII,"To the question of whatever or not I'd recommend this game, I find myself a bit iffy, the reason being frankly their is an horrible balance between the factions, in every single ways the Lightbringers are superior. I completed the Deathsworns Campaign and frankly it was an horrible grindfest, several levels took way too much time to finish due to the fact that against Lightbringers the Deathsworns really didn't match up, the last level after loosing tons of troops  hopelessly getting blown up by the Lightbringers I deadlocked over half of the map with Watchtowers to prevent as much enemy harvester movement and gather as much as humanly possible for myself, when finally all the money nodes on the map were exhausted I finally was able to move on the assault, otherwise the enemies were able to built too much troops to resist invasion and mostly I was forced to rely on a masses of balloons to destroy their key structures and I kept having to make new units of balloons to be able to clear every objectives on the map, it took me an hour or grinding to be able to clear it because frankly the Deathsworns aren't a match.From the crappier ground units to the crappier flyers to the crappier ultimate weapon, the Deathsworns get perpetually owned by the Lightbringers in a fair fight. Let's start by the ultimate, the Deathsworns have the an Ultimate that do not do direct damage to the ground forces, while it instant kill air units... those freaking Phoenix can revive themselves... so yea... not great, the ground units while possible to one hit kill them require the Ultimate to be used in combination with an attack force or at least towers, it cannot harm enemy buildings... which is out of the first 4 factions (Armies & Hordes Factions) the only one that can't wreck the enemy bases with ultimates because of that freaking no damage to buildings and no direct damage to ground, the Lightbringers got a DoT AoE attack, which can kill enemy buildings and units. Next lets look at the stealth unit, the Deathsworm got a melee stealth unit, while its nice it can steal money... the Lightbringers got a stealth sniper, they can wreck an airforce with brutal deadliness... yea... I feel the Deathsworns got the gimmick stealth unit, while the Lightbringers got the useful one. Next the flyers, the Deathsworns got the Dragons and the Balloons, while the Dragons are medium to short range the balloons are pretty short range and can't hit air, the Lightbringers got the Phoenix that are medium ranged and same for the Air Spirit, both can hit air, and the freaking Phoenix can self-revive, and hit AoE too... while its not as massive as AoE as the Dragon, its pretty brutal at killing stuff and it can move while shooting, outstanding. For the rest of the ground units the same theme keep going on, the Lightbringers are overall better than the Deathsworns, so frankly after clearing the Deathsworns Campaign (painfully) why would you bother playing them ever again unless you really want a challenge, otherwise if you want to fair fight, you need to look somewhere else.So I find it hard to recommend this game in the series when one of the factions is effectively weaker than the other and while I haven't tried fighting the 4 other factions with it yet, I have a hard time expecting them to do anybetter against anyone else. Now I am sure some pro RTS player can do something descent with the Deathsworns, but the point is that same player would do better with any other faction.EDIT:After playing more of the 8-Bit Armies game, and in particular playing the Guardians Campaign, I'd say the Guardians are actually the worse faction of the first two games, the Deathsworns aren't all that much better, their Ultimate Weapon is still worse than the Guardians, but unit wise, the Guardians are a bit worse overall. Probably however the Deathsworns and even Lightbringers would have issues, at least early-mid game, against the Guardians due to the fact the Guardians seem to specialize in Anti-Infantry, between the Scorch Tank, the Scorch Turret, the Grenadeer Starter Troop, they'd be able to own those two Fantasy Factions in the early game, late game however the Air units of either factions would be able to destroy the Guardians, the Dragons would be a terrible deathbringer to the Guardians."

If you're into RTS or even got into it with C&C and Warcraft 1 you have to play this.The only few drawbacks are:- Attack move sucks- AI is just like back in the good old times (i.e. crappy and just dying over and over in your base's defense)- A bit too focused on building mass armies.Asided from this I thoroughly enjoy the game.

Everything is pretty smooth.8-Bit Hordes is like a copy of old Warcraft game, acts almost the same with some exceptions caused by used principles of this gamepredecessor.Tutorial, Manual, Tech Tree, Multiplayer and Skirmishes included. Campaign is obvious.This game has its predecessor in8-Bit Armieswhich shares the same UI and principles. The difference of theese titles is,8-Bit Armiesis inspired by old C&C games instead of Warcraft game.Thought about the devs can make something like 8-Bit Swarm inspired by Starcraft game, then I discovered8-Bit Invaderswhich perfectly matches this thought. Comming in November of 2016, I am awaiting completely the same controls, UI and everything like in8-Bit Armiesand 8-Bit Hordes just from the Starcraft world.After that an 8-Bit copy of Diablo may come?"

The mission introduce each unit 1 by 1 letting you easily get into the new factions.There is a slight skill unbalance atm, but that should be expected with some players being in the beta having more experience with the factions.

It's basically the promised added factions to the universe...but for a hefty sum in my opinion. Especially considering that the two new factions are indeed just Monsters and Humans...how inspired.Both factions play as you would expect them, with basic melee and ranged units that are suitably different. Both factions get access to healers later on, while the Orc healer can resurrect fallen enemies as skeleton archers. There is enough unit variety in general to make the 2 factions distinct, even down to their super weapons, alas, none of the units are actually very interesting or ""new"", Orcs, Ogres, Wraiths, Paladins, Magicians, Dragons, Airships, Giant Eagles...not only do the factions lack any real coherence (unlike for example in WC 3, in which the Orc faction consisted pretty much of 3 different races, here it's just a random assortment of ""bad guys""). The only saving grace here is the attack of the dragons, which plays a soundbite of people running away in pure terror. Yes, that was the most interesting part of the whole game -.- Sad, really. Not even the designs of the units are in any way interesting. Just generic.The big gameplay difference of the Hordes factions are the way they gather resources. There is no dedicated resource building, just your main building, which you can build multiple of in other places, but generally your harvesters travel quickly between the resource nodes and deliver very little with each run. They are also quite easy to destroy, can be built right from the start and only cost 100 gold. Upgrading your main building gives you access to higher tier tech...and don't fret if you think Tanks will steam roll your medieval infantry in MP games, some of them (for some arcane reason) can't be crushed. For the sake of game balance!The AI, however, is bloody stupid again. Instead of attacking those units that attack them they simply love to just shoot or hack at buildings and especially at mine carts!!!!! While being slaughtered!!! So, if you wanna save your guys, either have a lot of healers with them and just ignore every point of damage or you have to manually attack every enemy unit. Ridiculous. The battles themselves are terribly chaotic as well, since everything revolves around a big fat melee, it is virtually impossible to differentiate between your own and enemy units. This is especially nice when you encounter a new unit that throws out dynamite with a delayed explosion, but all you see are pixelly hit point bars on the screen (which suddenly turn from bright green to deep red in 1 second). Have fun trying to micro that...As for the campaign: This time around, thankfully, the campaigns each only have 12 missions...or quests as the game likes to call them. Sad to say, since I'm an avid SP fan, but getting through these campaigns is just utterly boring and actually irritating, which is why I just rush through on easy...which still takes a few hours per faction. The goals are pretty much the same: Destroy this, build this, collect this, which is always funny, when you just bum rush the enemy base in the final mission with 20 air ships and instantly win by destroying their HQ...lol. Literally the same as ""Armies"", just not with Tanks this time around. Ignore every enemy, just build defences, which are insanely strong, healers and some units for defense. Then mass produce the one unit which games the map and rush to the objective...zzz. The 1 mission in which you can't produce any units or buildings is actually the most challenging one. Mission 11 of the ""evil"" campaign can be completed in about 5 minutes, since you only have to build 5 super weapon structures... So lazy. The maps, of course are simply MP maps again, but at least they look prettier and you won't play on the same map 10 times. The story, again, lacks coherence and when you're done there's just ""nothing"", which makes every achievement seem somewhat...trivial. There's no reward for beating the campaign. No cutscenes, no big revelations, no unlocks, nothing.Music: It's Frank Kle♥♥♥♥♥ again, but the ""medieval themes"", while suitably ""epic"" and ""8-Bitty"" aren't really that outstanding compared to his other work. Don't get me wrong, they are great pieces of music, as always, but they don't get you pumped up during the game and are just a bit on the weaker side in my opinion."

Playing through this game made me not regret for buying this. Now my first impression about this game, was simple. The graphics were pleasing, the battle system isnt too complicated and most of all my favourite part is the base building. My review may not be able to provide everything as i only played single player and have not tested the muiltplayer.Pros:A good number of diverse units to play, without any complicated systemsThe good old classic base building mechanic that seems to be missing in the modern takes of RTS gamesSimple and easy for anyone trying out the RTS genreCons:In the first few missions you would realise there is only the rush tatics to win (no turtling)The game seems to be unbalanced in some areas where the problems lies with the AIInconclusion the game may not be perfect. But the good parts of the game puts the problem below. The game may seem repetive to some with the long campaign. The options to play both armies from the first 8-Bit Arimes and Hordes for skirmishes and online gives a great experince.

There are also a few typos here and there (eg the tech trees). It would also be pretty cool if we could still have the 8-Bit Armies music in the game when the original factions are selected.If 8-Bit Armies' support was anything to go by, I'm sure Petroglyph will give 8-Bit Hordes the same treatment with constant tweaks and updates.Definately reccomended for fans of RTS or anyone who is looking for a more laid back experience."

The games are fast paced and enjoyable.I played a lot of games with both factions and in terms of balance the human equivalent seemed to be a bit strong.A couple of the negatives were the lack of basic features such as replays and player profiles.The most detrimental factor is a lack of any sort of matchmaking due to a low playerbase which can cause a lot of games to be very one-sided.If you can look past these flaws I highly recommend you pick it up as it is a well designed RTS game.

,Recommended,497850,24870163,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,Lil Pump,"8-Bit Hordes is a stand alone DLC to the game 8-Bit Armies. This addition adds two new factions which can be interchangeable between 8-Bit Armies and 8-Bit Hordes. For example you can play as DeathSworn(Orcs) and vs Renegades(Basic C&C army). The art style is very simple and the gameplay is also very simple making it an easy pickup game. Anyways lets go into the pros and cons.Pros:+Bunch of new maps and they are very different from the maps in 8-Bit Armies not just a copy and paste reskin+Factions are very different in play style and looks+New voice sets and music+You can cross play with 8-Bit armies+Different upgrade paths compared to 8-Bit Armies+Easy to learn, after a few matches you'll be a pro+Variety of new units in the new factions+Easily understandable upgrade paths for buildings units ect+Nostalagia of Warcraft III+Campaign has alot of missionsCons:-Campaign can be a bit repetitive-AI in campaign can be a bit 'dumb'(Destroying their base next to their army and they do nothing)-Barely any multiplayer games-Bit pricey8-Bit Hordes is a simple and fun additive to 8-Bit Armies. Although the campaign is a bit repetitive, its still pretty fun. Skirmish is fun and the AI is challenging but not overpowered. If youre getting this game for a competitive multiplayer I would not recommend because the quick match takes ages and there is barely any open lobbies. 100% get this game if you were a fan of Warcraft III and want a simple, fun and challenging game. Also if you enjoyed 8-Bit Armies this is a must pick!Rating: 8/10Great game guys can't want for your next updates and factions!"

So far, I'm enjoying the single and Multiplayer campaign more then I did in 8-bit armies.  Instead of power plants to keep your structures running, you build farms to grow your armies.  Neat change.There are a few techinical bugs I expect will get worked out over time, like a muiltiplayer game I was in slowed down because my teammate and I had a ton of units.Also, got this for 5$, since I owned the first game.

The two games are so alike. I'm not saying the creators have put little effort into this version of 8-bit Armies, but it feels like they have just made it for extra money. Unfortunatly, I made the mistake of buying this game instead of buying 8-bit armies.There is not a lot of game modes or options available.The game isn't very popular, therefore you struggle to find decent multiplayer matches during certain times of the day.The price is too much.

The combat is fluid and relatively well balanced. The blocky style 3D models are well animated and sound effects are perfect.Note: 8-bit hordes gives you single player missions and multiplayer with the two armies it features, but if you have no interest in the single player missions you may want to consider ""8 bit Armies: Arena"" instead, which gives you acess to all the multiplayer content but it does not include any of the single player missions."

Right now you have the armies which have a certain eco style and now the Horde. Since they said they were coming out with 6 races in total I hope they have a different eco style as well. My favorite thing about this is probably that it is retro and also There is no UNIT CAP (that I know of). There is also a ladder system that you can track your progress vs other players. So for you compettive people out there you can try to be number one. Lastly the gameplay is very clean and you don't need a good computer to play.

You make massive armies only to have them cleaned out in under 30 seconds flat due to bad path finding, or your army just doing nothing. Ifyou send troops anywhere, they dont attack UNTILL they reach the point, so with massive armies, you cant actually do anything. your entire army tries to get there, and cant attack until it does, and then only some of thre troops reach that exact spot due to the massive army, so the rest try pathfinding to get there meanwhile being picked off and not attacking back. Me and a friend did on easy difficulty, the FIRST co op mission. 200 troops eachGone in 30 seconds"

I've had great fun with it so far, and it's really interesting being essentially a standalone expansion from 8-Bit Armies so the modern military and the medieval fantasy factions can fight on equal footing. I'm hoping there will be a third game to add in the sci-fi futuristic factions, perhaps a sentient mechanical army and a full-fledged alien army? I look forward to seeing what the future holds for this series!"

,Recommended,497850,29864893,Posted: 11 February,all,GarrickWinter,"8-Bit Hordes is an interesting follow-up to 8-Bit Armies, building on the last game and adding more mechanics, more distinct factions, and better mission design. The game remains fast-paced as ever, and the RTS fundamentals are still all there, but Petroglyph are working their way up.Combat is expanded on with melee units and a variety of new ability types, such as AoE healing and necromancy, which add flavour and distinctness to the factions. Some of the most interesting units, like a stealthy rogue who can assassinate infantry and steal from resource units, are kind of wasted given the rapid pace of combat (and the fact that every other unit and building seems to be able to detect stealth), but for the most part everything has its place.Mission design in the campaign is far more interesting and less annoying than it was in 8-Bit Armies. Whereas that game generally had a bonus objective involving completing the other objectives in less than 10/15/20 minutes, 8-Bit Hordes generally has better-defined and more strategic secondary objectives that help you out in the map. The threadbare ""story"" is even slightly more interesting this time around, acknowledging the weirdness of the series and breaking the fourth wall a bit.Overall, this is another fast and fun 8-Bit RTS. It's not ""accessible"" like it sometimes purports to be - a lot of the hotkeys are obscure, and the game hasn't improved on many of the interface inconveniences of traditional RTS games. But for fans of the genre, this is a neat little thing to play in what's becoming a reasonably interesting, if somewhat flawed and simple, series."
76561198262898921,Recommended,497850,29859680,Posted: 11 February,all,Touhou Project,"Just an opening remark: alot of the negative reviews you will see for this game seem to be from 2016 when 8-Bit Armies only had one to two factions and very limited content. Very recently, a multiplayer stand-alone for this game was released called 8-Bit Armies: Arena, which costs $5 and gets you all 6 factions that have been released as of the writing of this review, though multiplayer-only, so I suggest you check that out:I already wrote a review for 8-Bit Armies but I'm gonna repeat what I said at the start for 8-Bit Hordes as it applies to this game as well:8-Bit Hordes is the latest throwback to the ""golden-age of Real-Time Strategy"" in the 90's and early 00's, back before Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas like League of Legends were a thing. The gameplay is fairly simple: you build a base, gather resources, mass up units, and throw them at the enemy until one of you are dead. The graphics are designed to be fairly simple to reduce the strain of the game on your PC, particularly with the army sizes the game can reach. Since its initial launch, two other standalone games have been released, 8-Bit Armies and 8-Bit Invaders, which are cross-compatible (meaning you can play the factions against each other), so if you care about single player you might as well get those two as well.The main thing that makes the gameplay unique is that building additional buildings provide a multiplier bonus that stacks infinitely, so while one Barracks will train an infantry unit 100% fast, five Barracks train infantry 500% quickly, ten train 1000% quickly, and so on, allowing you to grow armies to ludicrous sizes quickly. As a consequence, though, even larger games tend to last no more than 10-15 minutes, especially as you get lots of harvesters and resources on the map run out. In addition, random crates spawn when you destroy neutral buildings and objects, giving you effects that range from free units to healing to damaging the unit that collect it, adding a factor of randomness to your games.In contrast to 8-Bit Armies, 8-Bit Hordes has a single-player campaign of 12 missions in one campaign and 12 missions in another. The missions have more variety to them compared to 8-Bit Armies, but I still wouldn't expect much out of the campaign: the missions still take place on skirmish maps though, there are no cutscenes, and the only story is pre-quest dialogue.  The side objectives that reward you with new starting units have become more varied, however, and are easier to obtain as they don't require you to win in a short amount of time.The skirmish mode is pretty good with a decent selection of maps (and much more if you decide to get the expansions). 8-Bit supports up to eight player gameplay, and the AI is pretty good too. Finally, with the launch of 8-Bit Armies: Arena, multiplayer is much more livelier and it's fairly easy to find someone to play with. Replays and observer mode have also been implemented for more competitive players.The factions you get when you buy 8-Bit Hordes are the ""Deathsworn"" and the ""Lightbringer"" (based on the Warcraft games).  Both factions use the food system as a secondary resource: which is basically a population limit.  Each unit costs one food, which is maintained with Farms.  If you ever hit your food cap, all unit product halts until you build more Farms.  In addition, both factions use cheap, weak harvesters that are trained and store resources at their HQ buildings rather than a dedicated refinery.  Finally, both factions have two superweapons: one that reveals fog of war around a target and one that creates a major effect at a designated location.-Deathsworn is a hard-hitting barbarian race akin to the Orcish Horde in Warcraft.  Their units tend to be more aggressive and are great when massed.  Their superweapon is the Blizzard, which freezes enemies in place: frozen units are immobile and are destroyed in one hit.  They have strong early-game units and are great for offensive-minded player.-Lightbringer is a diverse faction with strong unit abilities akin to the Human Alliance in Warcraft.  Their units tend to be more gimmicky, but are very effective when used properly.  Their superweapon is Holy Arrow, which damage enemies and heal allies in a target.  Their early game is weaker, but their late-game units are very effective, making them ideal for a defensive-minded player.Overall, 8-Bit Hordes' factions tend to be very gimmicky and have the most radically different tech tree of the three games.  Their units tend to rely more on special abilities and synergy than other races, and combined with the obtrusive food system Hordes tends to be harder for new players than the other two games (though still very easy to pick up).  If you like colorful abilities and a more controlled unit spam over blunt functionality, I recommend trying the factions in this game.Final impressions? 8-Bit Hordes is a great game if you're new to Real Time Strategy in general, as it's simple to learn but hard to master.  While the game is more complex than 8-Bit Armies, the units are more varied and are all very simple to use yet very fun. I highly recommend it for both fans of older RTS games (particularly Command and Conquer) and newer gamers interested in getting into the genre."

The factions in this game add two unique factions that have a system entirely different from 8-bit armies. What I find to be the most exciting of this game is its cross-play feature that allows you to play the factions of this game against those of 8-bit armies, so you'll be able to pit knights, dwarves, elves, and orcs against modern military."

Unleash the horde, go full zerg mode!While I didn't like the gameplay for personal reasons, I can see this as a great game if you like the style: As the name implies, you ""control"" hordes of troops against other equally big hordes. No micromanagement, no strategy, no TIME as resources are very little and end somewhat fast (30 min tops), so the game further pushes you to build as fast as possible, attack as fast as possible, and not to care about anything else other than keep the hordes coming. Some objectives even have tight time restrictions to make it even more rushed. So, in short:+ Rush as hell, destroy your mouse buttons+ No micromanagements or upgrades, everyone is expendable+ If you think you are taking too long, you are- No strategy. Even though there is the usual A beats B beats C which beats A, in the middle of 100 troops you kind of don't care, or don't have time to care- Resource management is null, as you ""pay as you go"" (you don' pay for structures or troops foward, you are deducted as they are built, so queueing 100 troops doesn't mean you have resources to do them)- Weak campaign or skirmish modes, since ever map is just a rush competition.The ""zerg vs zerg"" analogy fits perfect, except this one doesn't even have upgrades!"
