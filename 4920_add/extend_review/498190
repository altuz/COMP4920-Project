In fact, I'll preface this by saying you should probably buy it on sale, as its not a very big game for its regular $6.99 price.HOWEVERFor what it's worth, this game is pretty fun. Its VERY fast-paced and exciting while still taking some amount of strategy to complete. You can't just rampage about and hope to win. You have to think about what to do and where to attack next, and in a hurry. It's quite a challenge that makes you think fast, literally. Plus I love the music during Rampage. It rocks!Will it keep you distracted for hours? Probably not.Is it fun? Absolutely!"

It's a really nice game...But this game is not worth $5The only way I was able to squeeze one hour of playtime out of this game was by playing it over and over and frankly, this game is not good for venting frustration on a bad day unless your idea of venting frustration is ""getting carpal tunnel because this game is restricted to the arrow keys on your keyboard unless you have a controller"" and you will need to rapidly press left and right a LOT.If your idea of a good time is ten minutes of enjoyment and then approximately forty minutes of clutching your hand in pain and yelling then go for it"

Not even enough variety that I am aware of to even be worth a second play.  I could be missing something important but as I dont see an EA tag I do not think I am.Buy the game if you think the trailer looks awesome as that is literally the entire game in that video.
,Recommended,498190,24534967,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,BinkSayres,"Bottom line up front - This game is a fun little romp in the village.  It's short, but worth it.  It's currently on sale at the time I write this.  So get it now!There's plenty of YouTubers out there covering this game, so there's not much more I can add.Pros:- Awesome Music- Excelent visual style- concise gameplay- fast paced actionCons:- Short - You can play through it in ~ 15 minutes if you're taking your time.To be fair, though...as you're getting to the end, you almost are thankful when it's over because of how crazy everything is.  Again, as I stated at the beginning, get this game.  It's a short, but awesome, experience that is very easy to come back to once in a while.  It's not a 20 hour epic, but it doesn't need to be.  It's just a lot of fun.  Get it now."
,Not Recommended,498190,24488939,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,shell_game,"I feel a little bad, but I have to say I can't recommend this game. Honestly, I had to check again and see if this was still being developed. There are so many little issues that need to be fixed before you can really call this a finished game. Firstly, the hitboxes for the people and the houses feel awkwardly precise, this should really be more fluid and intuitive. Second, art and animations are buggy. The dragon's sprite won't change until you move, and won't change again if you continue moving. Also many things abruptly appear or disappear: the dragon doesn't die, it just blips out. The buildings don't look like anything until they're built. If these things weren't at least attempted in other instances (that the dragon changes at all or that the buildings have some kind of build indicator) then it would be forgivable. But because some things were attempted but not all, it makes it seem incomplete. There's lots of potential for this, but it needs lots of polish first.Pass until they put out a patch."

Such satisfaction in slaming into everything and getting those power ups to easily stay ahead and achievements that aren't complicated/cryptic as ****.When I first saw the negative reviews for this game, I hated what they put into the reviews because all they said was its too short or I paid too much for so little content. How about they try to make a game all by themselves?! It's not easy. Give these people some slack because I'm pretty sure those negative review people don't even think about how hard it is to make a game.The service from the game creator that I had was above perfect. I was pretty surprised that it was responded to and taken care of so quickly. Then again I usually play huge games like Paladins or Heroes of the Storm where it could easily be ignored. I really appreciate this guy and hope there are others like him out there."

,Recommended,498190,24491602,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,paj,"I myself enjoy the game even though most people seem to dislike it. I feel the reason people do dislike it is this its very very short for the price of 7$ and even though i got it for 15% of it still seemed short for the price. If they were to maybe add some new levels, more customization and possibly even some story to the rampage plot, or at least make it an option to change the background. Customization could be like which power up you like more and want to drop on your 100ks drop, or even more exciting giving dragons clothes and hats! But all in all its a great stress releasing game and definetly reminds me of the old rampage games. Also I feel like I'd really enjoy the creators should slowly releasing updates and adding little bits here and there and that will surely keep me happy and probably the rest of this games small fanbase.Would have to say 8.5/10"

It is meant to be a thrasher and smasher - a way to just eat the heck out of a few villages and work out that day you had. I loved the graphics, and the sound performed as I wanted.  A few more control notes etc would have been appreciated. All in all I enjoyed it and have kept coming back after a few weeks to crank out some more destruction. At $6.99 USD I wsould say that is the max they could offer something like this - if you get 5 hours out of it that is just over a buck an hour, which isn't that bad.If you can get it on sale, I say go for it! Fun little game and extremely satsifying! Have a look if you'd like!https://youtu.be/yYCmItfKMz4"
76561198058012360,Recommended,498190,31552032,Posted: 4 May,all,AzureFlameGodChaos,"you know, for a game that can beaten in the span of 15 minutes to an hour, this isnt a bad game. alabit it's not great but it's still worth atleast getting it during a sale for 5$ or under. The game reminds me of the Death Worm games, what with the whole kill tha 'umans and their stuff while trying to stave off your hunger, though this game does it's own thing, something erks me abit.First and foremost is that there is no type of permanent upgrade system, which is fine with how there are only 3 levels in the game, it makes what you got somewhat stale at times.The second thing is the enemy types, namely the lancers, the wizzards, and the preistesses. The lancers deal so much knock back that they're the main cause of gameovers, especially the mounted ones. Wizzards, on the other hand, freeze you for a short time, making it hard to get away or even try to eat them. But the worst is the Preistesses, as their bubble brings to mind the Nullifiers from Warframe with the added benifit that while the bubble is up, they can't be attacked even if you are in the bubble, thus you have to waste time attacking the bubble while you yourself are being attacked.The third and final thing that miffs me is the limited usefulness of some abilities/powerups. The roar ability is only useful for getting enemies off you, which is the one thing youDON'Twant to do as they also recover your health, and the roar does enough damage to kill the pessants in once shot. The unlimited dash and the unlimited jump pale in comparison to the instant rampage powerup and the unlimited fire powerup, what with how useful rampage mode is in the first place and the unlimited fire not eating into your hunger gauge. Unlimited jump is useless due to how most of the time you will get it when you don't have enough food to do a dash to help with the jump, and Unlimited dash's only use is to build up combo meter to hope to get a better powerup.I also would of liked it if there was some type of customization to the dragon ie. diferent colors or being fatter etc.But overall it's not a bad game for under 10$ and it can give you some fun for about an hour or so."

,Recommended,498190,35119336,Posted: 21 September,all,Freeman1255,"A basic but fun time waster that could easily be made for both computers and phones (and before anyone asks, a phone game on pc or vice versa isn't always a bad thing, it can mean a bigger audiance and more exposure for developers and more $ along with more accesibility for customers if things are done right)But that's more of a formalityLets get down to the pros and cons of the game and what the game is aboutThis is like the concept of Rampage had a three way with the environment and themes of defend your castle and either Trogdor (for those that know Homestar Runner) or Skyrim (for those that don't know Homestar and the gang, but play games with dragons) and this is the babyThis game is far from the best game ever and its notoriously short, but aside from completing the campaign once, you won't play the campaign afterwards unless you go for a higher score or better timesBut you might be wondering, ""Then how can you reccomend the game?""I reccomend the game because the cream of the crop,if you will, is the game's endless mode, where you constantly race around looking for powerups and people to eat while destroying as many buildings as possible and figting off the ever increasing ammount of foes that come you way, from catapults to wizzards to priestesses to knights. What does this mean? This means the game can be fun to pick up and play every now and then for a few minutes or a round or two, it's quick, mindless fun, and  you'll enjoy playing the game in short bursts trying to live as long as you can while getting a score as high as you canNot to metion the game is appropriately priced and the person behind the game seems very humble (the person behind the game for example knew the game wasn't going to be huge and was thought of as a simple yet fun game to make and get a bit extra cash in his pocket) cuz the game is only 5 dollars if I remember correctly (I got the game for 2.79 while it was on sale)This game isn't anything groundbreaking, but is simple mindless fun, and sometimes that's all a game needs to be (:EDIT-After checking, I do think the game is a bit over priced (7 dollars normally) so I would STRONGLY reccomend getting the game while its on sale, other than it being a bit too high priced for what its worth, its a fun game, like I mentioned, just wait for it to be on sale or the price to go down"
