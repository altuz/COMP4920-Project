,Recommended,498330,24529930,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,LAYING DOWN SUPPRESSING FIRE,"As an owner of 4 cats, I can definitely confirm that cats are, in fact, liquids."
,Recommended,498330,24637736,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,Otter Chaos,"Cats are Liquid states the obvious.  I know that no matter how much fencing I put up, or how careful I think I am when I open the door, sooner or later I will find my cat in the neighbors yard.  The fact that cats are liquid is really the only rational explanation for this.Here though, we finally have proof that this is true.  As you guide your cat through the levels of the game, you can clearly see the ability to become liquid, or even gaseous, is the primary way cats navigate through narrow areas or over wide gulfs.  This educational documentary presents these facts in an entertaining format that is simple enough for children to understand, yet amusing enough for adults.The idea is made very plain.  Navigate your cat to the exit of the level, while not touching anything orange.  Wise use of the ability to transform into different states of matter allows travel in any direction, and skillful play is rewarded with, well, a cat that is still alive.  That should be enough though, since we must watch over our cats, and not let them perish in a pit of lava.  That's what we call bad cat parenting.At least it isn't terribly difficult to keep this cat safe.  While the simple geometric graphics may remind you of some of the more brutal platformers out there, Cats are Liquid, at least as far as I've played, is a much calmer experience than games like LOVE, or VVVVVV.  Think Thomas Was Alone, but with a cat, who really is alone.  I mean, Thomas wasn't really alone all that long was he?Anyway, I find Cats are Liquid a casual platformer, something that you could easily play with your kids.  If they get to cocky, give em Electronic Super Joy, that'll learn em."

Platformering is tight and easy to learn.2. Intresting Story that leaves some mysterys and some stunning reveals.3. A 2-3 hours of gameplay for a 1$ game.Bad Stuff:1. The Companion levels try to explain the story while you have a timelimit that resets the level.2. No level editor so after the game is finished there isn't much else to do except trying to get some of the more difficult achivements.3. The first powerup in the game makes it VERY easy to skip parts of the level.However this ability is lost near the end of the game, so it's up to you whether it bothers you or not.If you have a dollar and you're looking nice platformer you could do a lot worse."

,Recommended,498330,24650885,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,ApocaLiz,"So I got way more invested in this game than I expected to. Mechanically, it is a minimalistic platformer, you navigate a strange world as a cat who can turn into liquid and gas. You even get your own companion cube, or in this case square.It's not particularly difficult, though there were a couple of levels in the last world that took me a while and even made me ragequit once. But all in all, this is a pretty easy game.The bit I got strangely invested in was the story, which is told through bits of narration on screen as you navigate the levels. The story stays pretty vague and a bit cryptic, though the companion level pack clears a bit of it up. It's mostly the inner monologue of the cat and it is weirdly bleak and borderline existential. This is what sells the game for me. Without the story it would have been a fun but forgettable platformer, but with the story it'll stay with me a while.I think it's worth more than the asking price, and it's definitely a dollar well spent."

But as the game continued on there were a whole lot of things that started to bug me. There are a series of worlds, and in each world there are 10 rooms. The thing that became a continuous bother to me was that the game didnt get harder as it went on, it was just a spew of inconsistant difficulties that made progressing in the game annoying and making it feel more like a chore. Along the way you get 3 super cool powers that are awesome at adding new mechanics, but the game goes ahead and takes the major one away from you later in the worlds. This really ruined the flow that the game had somewhat created in the 6 worlds beforehand. The game turned into something I was really worried about it being, a rage game. It went from a challenging yet pleasent ride to a hair-ripping and headset throwing chore.Play the first half of the game, i wouldnt bother with the second."

Some abilities and some obstacles didn't really feel like they added a lot to the game. Levels were too big for what was in them, looking empty as a result. For much of the game, there was an option to cheese it by abusing the “steam form” and just floating through entire levels. There are some inconsistencies in difficulty too, since it ranges from extremely simple to pretty frustrating (especially in the final levels).On the other hand, the game looks very pretty and cute.

Game starts of a basic and very easy platforming experience, at the first glance it looked like something you would calm and relase your stress. The twist of the gameplay mechanic starts when we are introduced to different powerups we collect during the gameplay. Music is calming, some level designs are unique and creative and the artstyle is nice for the eye.Pros:-Artstyle, simple, yet charming music.-Simplistic gameplay.-Long game with cheap price.Cons:-The biggest problem of this game was the steam powerup that could let player pass the 70% of the levels, making it less challengeling and boring. Making this power depletable and rechargable at specific points/checkpoints might balance it out.-The story had no actual base, no clue what it was supposed to be, wasn't sure if ""she"" was reffering to the cat or the owner anymore. Repetive, obvious, pointless sentences. Would be glad if it was written from the scratch.-The balance between checkpoint placement and the instant kill objects, have to pass the long, boring and easy part just to get killed instantly and do this part again.-The bug where you get under a specific object and holding jump button makes player and the object fly upwards.Hate to give this game such a negative review, considering it has a lot of potential, but it definitelly needs patches that would make the gameplay enjoyable.Also the God Mode achievement is just impossible to do, considering you have to beat 90 levels without a single damage where some obstacles are impossible to dodge, if there was an option to play God Mode difficulity, it would be more like playing with only 1 health point, not only 1 try and play the game from the start again, but some obstacles definitelly need some tweaking."

Communism , Here is the life of Mao ZedongMao Zedong or Mao Tse-tung  December 26, 1893 – September 9, 1976 also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary and founding father of the People's Republic of China, which he ruled as an autocrat styled the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949, until his death in 1976. His Marxist–Leninist theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism or Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.Born the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan, Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. Mao adopted Marxism–Leninism while working at Peking University and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Guomindang (GMD) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the GMD under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), after Japan's defeat China's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the Nationalists who withdrew to Taiwan.On October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a one-party state controlled by the CPC. In the following years Mao solidified his control through land reform campaigns against landlords, and perceived enemies of the state he termed as ""counter-revolutionaries"". In 1957, he launched the Great Leap Forward campaign that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from an agrarian economy to an industrial one. The campaign contributed to a widespread famine, whose death toll is estimated at between 15 and 45 million. In 1966, he initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a program to remove ""counter-revolutionary"" elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao's personality cult. In 1972, Mao welcomed American President Richard Nixon in Beijing, signalling a policy of opening China, which was furthered under the rule of Deng Xiaoping (1978–1992). Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976, dying in that September, aged 82. He was succeeded as Paramount leader by Hua Guofeng (1976–1978), who was quickly sidelined and replaced by Deng.A controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important individuals in modern world history, and is also known as a theorist, military strategist, poet and visionary. Supporters credit him with driving imperialism out of China,modernising China and building it into a world power, promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, and increasing life expectancy as China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million during the period of his leadership.In contrast, critics consider him a dictator comparable to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin who severely damaged traditional Chinese culture, as well as a perpetrator of systematic human rights abuses who was responsible for an estimated 40 to 70 million deaths through starvation, forced labour and executions, ranking his tenure as the top incidence of democide in human history."

The last couple levels though, you're trying to get your liquid cat through tight areas, some of which are outright impossible to avoid hazards.

,Not Recommended,498330,25124622,"Posted: 24 August, 2016",all,Imban,"Cats are Liquid is an indie platformer based on the idea of, well, playing a cat with no bones that can slide through small holes and at incredible speeds. Unfortunately, it's bogged down by more gimmicks than your standard indie platformer, most of which are useless outside of when you specifically and clearly need it to proceed, and one of which breaks the game wide open for as long as you have it, as well as hilariously janky physics.For basic controls, your blobcat can jump by pressing up, or turn into a liquid by holding down, in addition to moving left and right. Turning into liquid allows it to move through narrow spaces, but it also gives a speed boost, which can be used to reach incredible speeds for long-distance jumps. Oddly enough, jumping - the staple of almost every platformer - is the messed-up core mechanic here, since you can jump any time you are in contact with a surface, or sometimes just in midair for no clear reason. Jumping increases your upward speed, even if you are already moving upward at the maximum speed from a previous jump, allowing you to scale walls incredibly rapidly, or fly through the air by jumping from under a physics object, pushing it up with you and guaranteeing you have something to continue jumping against.Later on in the course of the 90 levels of the main game, you get the ability to turn into steam, which makes you move much slower but you slowly float upward instead of falling downward, summon a weighted companion square which can't do anything but move left and right, but which can't be harmed by a lot of hazards and can press switches only designed for it, and drop bombs that destroy small diamond-shaped walls. On top of the liquid form, this is a relatively large amount of gimmicks for an indie platformer, most of which only have one major player gimmick. While that's not bad by itself, the weighted companion cube and bombs are never useful except in the situations where they're specifically called for (walls of fire you can't walk through with switches on the other end, and small diamond-shaped walls, respectively) and the bombs are basically never used in any interesting fashion. Flying with steam, meanwhile, lets you ignore basically every hazard or difficulty for the entire time you have that power, making it far too useful. The only reason I didn't use it more is that it's fairly slow, and I wanted to be done with the game faster even if it meant running my cat into hazards a few times.The collision detection is also pretty bad - as I mentioned, there were a few times where it seemed like I could jump despite not touching anything. This also unfortunately applies to hit detection sometimes, and while you have to take three hits from most things in order for your cat to respawn at the start of level or a checkpoint, some hazards will send you back to the start instantly. It wasn't all that frustrating, especially due to how quickly most levels could be solved if you knew where the hazards were ahead of time, but it still didn't leave me with a positive impression of the coding.The 30-level Companion Square campaign, on the other hand, was more typical of indie platformers, given that in each 10-level section, your companion square has one special ability: boosting its speed in the first ten, jumping vertically in the second ten, and stopping in place and becoming unaffected by physics and objects for as long as you want in the final ten. The companion square's indestructibility in the core game carries over, so instead these levels are timed, with new purple hazards either draining your time or sending you back to a checkpoint or the start. While these levels were refreshingly different, I found the first twenty kind of limited in what they offered, and only the last set were interesting. Also, the time limits were not well-implemented - your time continued ticking down if you were sent back to the start, until you ran out of time (which also sent you back to the start, even if you'd hit a checkpoint) or manually restarted the level. This meant that I had to manually restart Companion Square levels fairly frequently, because being sent back to the start with only half of the time remaining was pointless.Finally, while it's not a major part of the game, I was a bit bothered by the story in Cats are Liquid. It starts off cute, but ends on a note somewhere between depressing and horror, which wasn't exactly what I expected going into this. It didn't really make coherent enough sense to me to register as anything other than a sad creepypasta or something, but... eh!In the end, I went into this expecting a silly $1 cat game. Cats are Liquid delivered on that, but not in a way where I feel I can really recommend it to anyone."

,Recommended,498330,24792143,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,An Easy Target,"Presently unable to form words to do this magnificent little game justice, I will just say one thing, which I advise you not to mouse over if you want to avoid spoilers.I want to track down everypet abuserin a square mile radius and rip his/her Goddamn throat out.I apologize for this irrational statement that explains nothing about the game itself. I presently need time to clear my head so I can give this gem a proper- or, half-decent, at any rate- critique. Until such time, I want it recorded as having my up-vote, and I will simply say here a sort of abridged review, from what little I can gather from my preoccupied and scattered thoughts; I shall return to expand on it later. Please note that this has slight spoilers, as well, and I would advise caution if you'd prefer the story to be with as little pre-set expectation as possible.In my opinion, this is a very engaging game. The story is mysterious, very creatively told via lines of text set in the environment, and, while bearing much levity in terms of choice of wording, ultimately powerful- if you moused over the above-warned line, you can probably tell that I, for one, have been strongly affected by it.The gameplay, in my opinion, is amazingly fun. The protagonist herself is comprised of a collection of malleable orbs which stick together in a sort of cloud; movement consists of an assortment of different methods, including rolling, sliding, wall-jumping, and another ability that you can discover early on. On that note, there are some abilities you can discover which add welcome elements of variety to the gameplay. The character moves fluidly, her locomotion and transitioning between different states to be flawless.I find it rather difficult to describe, but the gameplay involves a great deal of potential skill ceiling, and in my opinion would lend itself very well to speed-running- so much so, that I am surprised, and I must confess slightly disappointed, that there is not an option for an in-game Timer. I hope I might be able to afford explanation to this point regarding speed-running at some point in the future, if/when I am able to return to this.The soundtrack... ties in with the happenings of the story, such that I fear to comment on it would spoil more than I alrady have. However, I can say that it is very surreal, and oddly pleasant, although very eerie, to listen to. I've much the same to say regarding the graphics, if one replaces ""listen to"" with ""look at"".I, for one, heartily recommend this game, if you are fond of physics-based platformers.Mind you, I have only played through the game once, and, again, have written this with a clouded mind. What's more, I've yet to play the Companion Mode. I intend to return to this review and change it accordingly, proceeding my having done so, as well as replaying the ""Normal"" story line."

Everything, it seems, is all one or two colors. Pretty early on, a third color is introduced, orange, which hurts you. It's pretty simple. Boringly simple.It's insane the amount of speed you can get in this game. Holding down turns the cat blue into some sort of extra watery form and you can speed by horizontal sections simply by hugging the ground with your watery cat body, and you can fall quickly by repeatedly tapping it. The cat can also slowly climb up verticle surfaces, but I discovered pretty early that you can exponetially speed this up by tapping jump.This led to me speeding through the boring levels as fast as I could avoiding anything orange, which amused me for some time, but eventually wore down into monotony. After about a dozen levels, the cat gets a new power up which allows it to sloooowly float upwards as a gas cloud. Also boring when hopping up walls is three times as fast.It doesn't help that this game's idea of ramping up difficulty seems to be adding things that just kill you in one hit. When the game introduced lava, it made sense, but later on you get jumping blocks that kill you at a touch, even if it hasn't crushed you.  Around the same time as that, it also added springy blocks that often push you into orange objects or the one hit kill hazards. A proper platformer would likely have them as trampolines but with such a boringly versatile moveset that the liquid cat has, the only thing the bouncy blocks can be is annoying. It was around there that I just said '♥♥♥♥ it' and left the game.Most levels also have a copius amount of writing on the walls, most of which is uninteresting or stating the blatantly obvious. I sped by two or three blocks of text in my efforts to get through the game as quickly as possible and I doubt I missed much. At one point, the text states the cat is getting tired of going through the mazes, a sentiment I wholeheartedly agreed with. At another point, it said 0/10 would not recommend. I had to wonder if it was self aware or if the text actually thought it was being charming.Ultimately, Cats are Liquid feels like a first game project. It's something somebody made in a month or two after learning Unity. It's fine. Nobody's good at making games when they first start. But I wouldn't want to buy someone's game development practice for a dollar.It's a good effort, but it's just not interesting."

Gameplay consists of you going through repetitive easy platforming levels using an awkward physics engine.

I played through the first world and a half before I got stuck in a wall and had to exit the game (there is no restart key). Throughout the first world and a half there was never anything interesting or difficult.This game is a platformer without challenge, a puzzler without puzzles, an art game without meaning or metaphor.

It wasn't for controls, it wasn't for anything that was poor about the construction. It was a VERY well made game. It's just, I didn't want to finish it. WAIT. Before you click off, listen to this. I have a friend that makes youtube videos. And he did a gameplay and I watched the whole thing and I wanted to try it. So of course, he was way ahead of me so, his videos would come out like 2 worlds ahead of me. Then, his final episode. The End. *SPOILER HERE!!!* I found that the cat locked herself in the world, and couldn't escape no matter how much she wanted. She wanted to get away from life, but she wanted to get out of the world she enveloped herself in. Her face disappears, and it starts to get weird. At the very end, she explains why she is there, she knocks the exit door off of a cliff and just before you see the spikes crush her, the screen goes black and the credits play. It made me sob and weep for half an hour, and I wanted to stop. I wanted to keep the memory away. Of course, I watched the scene again, just to see if I would cry like I did before, but I didn't, but it was still sad. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who gets sad easily or who just don't want all of their progress there for nothing (i.e. she knocks the end 'the exit door' off of a cliff, therefore, your time andyour effort is gone.) If you are not either and don't care, then ok buy it. Heck, its only 69 cents at the moment.

As a physics platformer, it has very wonky and exploitable physics which i used to accelerate myself through the level and bypass a great many obstacles. While holding the button to transform into liquid, you move at an accelerated rate, but you still have the ability to 'jump upwards' on any surface you touch. I could move along ceilings with this method at great speed. When the levels opened up late game, I could fly over most of the level.Other than the exploitable physics, 90 levels of samey obstacles made this rather a chore to play. Perhaps if it was cut down in length a bit or add some more diversity to the levels other than just change colours, it might have been more interesting. Some puzzles, such as the rotating room level were a refreshing change, but it only lasted a single level.The idea is fine, but it's let down by repetitive and unimaginative level design."

,Recommended,498330,24560628,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,JimDeadlock,"First ImpressionWhat immediately struck me about this game was the perfect control mechanisms. Most platformers I play have their individual quirks that you have to get used to at the start of the game such as a slightly delayed jump or unusual movements. As soon as I climbed up a wall (with controller) it just felt right and natural, the jumping and floating had exactly the right amount of speed and responsiveness, it was a joy to play in that respect.OverviewYou are a 'cat' navigating a maze of physics obstacles. Your movement is like that of a water-filled balloon, hence the 'liquid' in the title. You can ooze through tiny gaps, hop up high vertical walls and float up/along as a gas cloud. Later in the game you can use bombs to break walls or release and control a square on a time limit to move ahead and unlock a passage for the cat. You play as only the square in the Companion levels, under time constraints.A couple of hours after playing it I can't even remember what the background music was like, it was so unobtrusive, which is a good thing. Likewise the graphics are minimalistic and functional, nothing wrong with that. There's a loose story written in the background based on the cat being trapped and complaining about the prolonged journey (she has a point!)The ""90+30 levels"" claim is a bit cheeky, it's actually 9+3 levels each with 9 waypoints where your 3 lives are topped up (or time reset).GlitchesFrom the levels menu the escape key doesn't work so you have to start a level and exit from there in order to close the game. Took a while to work that one out.On completion of both Standard and Companion the screen fades to black and everything becomes unresponsive so the only way you can get out is by forcefully crashing the game. Perhaps this is intentionally consistent with the storyline, who knows!I've definitely completed Companion because I reached the end credits but 22/30 of the levels remain locked. I've repeated many levels (by starting at the last unlocked level) to double-check but no, still locked.I'm on Linux if that makes a difference. Maybe if the developer reads this review the bugs will be fixed by the time you read it. None of it affects the actual gameplay anyway.Gameplay OpinionExperienced platform players should be able to complete the game in their sleep with very few retries - for much of Standard you can effortlessly float past most obstacles. The Companion levels have time constraints but are also easy.The consistency of the game mechanics unfortunately extends to the predictable, monotonous gameplay and many of the levels are identical but played with different abilities. There is no innovation here, just the usual elements you've seen in countless other platformers.I completed Standard in 4 hours and Companion in 1 at medium pace. I may attempt the 2 clean-run achievements later to 100% it but probably not. I'd say the quantity of gameplay is very good value for the price.AchievementsThese entail completing each level and then playing the whole thing again in a perfect uninterrupted run. Pretty unimaginative, but then again there are no remarkable gameplay features to warrant an interesting achievement. I still don't have the 'Always There' achievement so I don't know what it is. I'm happy it has achievements at all anyway, and the developer has just said he's considering trading cards in future.VerdictMost of this review may seem negative but that's not the case at all. I did enjoy this, it's just that lately I've been playing very challenging and unique physics games like Portal, Nihilumbra and Metamorphic, so this seemed pedestrian by comparison. If it's a casual experience you're after then I highly recommend this, especially at the rock-bottom price. It's like a mass-produced japanese car: well-built, familiar and comfortable but rather bland."

Everything about it I love so much; the simple gameplay, the atmospheric music, and the simple, yet heart-crushing story that leaves so many questions. But that's not a bad thing: the game leaves a good chunk of what's happening up to the player's interpretation and because of that, you begin to think and theorize about what's exactly happening in this world that the game presented to you because it doesn't spoon-feed you the answers that you want - you have to think.Gameplay is by far the simplest part of this game: 2D platforming, but with a few unique twists to the generic formula. Sure, the game's primary method of transportation is jumping, but you also have the ability to turn into a liquid (Hence the name of the game) to squeeze through small passages in the walls, turn into a gas (Pretty clever in my opinion) to float around levels, use bombs to blow up special walls, and funnily, the most significant ability, utilize a gray square to press buttons in places you can't reach normally. The game builds significance around these abilities and gives care in making sure that these abilities aren't one-off and used once then forgotten. (The game makes you FEEL the importance of the abilities later in the game.)The game's music is truly something to behold. The simple, escalating tunes that play as you go level to level help build the world and it's atmosphere, setting the mood for what's to come. I would totally buy an OST of this game if it were available. From the gentle, curious tones of the first few levels to the heavy, depressed theme of the Reset levels, the music is perfect.I could keep going, but I already have an essay, so in conclusion, Cats are Liquid is a wonderful experience, and absolutely worth the 99 cents. (Even though I personally think the game is worth more) Thank you, Half Quarter Studios, for this wonderful game. Can't wait to play it again and cry, smile and ponder.

If you are into speed running check this out as it is pretty easy to play normally but can get pretty hard once you try optimizing movement with the different forms of matter. Also, it has little to no RNG.Starts off as a cute (but easy) platformer that has interesting physics and gets a bit more difficult towards the end. The story also takes a more serious turn towards the end as well. I did not encounter any bugs with the game during my play through, the music is nice and graphics are nice and run fine on my laptop. The controls are easy to understand and intuitive(I played with an XBOX 360 controller). For a low price platformer I'd probably give this a 7/10, but since it's $0.99, and I didn't encounter any bugs I give it a solid 8/10. I've been wanting to get into speed running for a while and have been trying out multiple games, and this seems like it's going to be the first one I put serious time into for the reasons I said in the TL:DR."

At first glance is seems super uncreative with orange blocks and blue squares and minimal change in walls, but it's those simple graphics that really give this game it's touch. This game is a very fun, interactive platformer whose story is very intriguing. While I'm not sure exactly what happened to the cat in the story, or why it is gaining powers, you get the sense that it is feeling trapped for a reason. This is a wonderful platformer, one of my favorites, and the story is a lot darker than you think. There is even an extra story mode (though much shorter) about another 'character' in the game. All in all, including the extra story, this game took me a little over six hours, and I enjoyed every minute!9/10"

,Recommended,498330,30420770,Posted: 9 March,all,literally sighs,"i bought this game a long time ago after selling some trading cards or something. the title seemed quirky and it looked alright, so i figured it was worth a dollar.at first i was really turned off by the simplistic graphics, text on the walls, and that weird cat face thing. i kept playing, though. i liked it when the cat gained the ability to evaporate, but the rest of the features seemed forced to me. i left the game alone after level 4 and came back after a few months.i came to love the graphics and level design. i started to adore the cute, squishy cat. i had a strange fondness for the gray companion square, and i felt unstoppable upon gaining all the abilities.then it got sad.this is a surprisingly innovative, emotionally moving game that centers aroundcoping with death. it tackles the turmoil of feelings one would experience quite well, starting with confusion and denial and ending witha terse argument between the cat and her owner, allowing the player to see thatthe endless maze of levels is actually a physicality of the fear, insecurity, and abandonment felt by the cat. her character and personality develops throughout the gamein a way someone would typically deal with death, starting out unable to accept reality and eventually becoming angry and desperate, eventually reaching uneasy closure, which is actually really commendable for any game of any size.or maybe i'm just reading too much into a cute, squishy cat gameregardless, i really enjoyed cats are liquid, and will probably replay it a few more times just because i like it so much. this game is, in my opinion, definitely well worth the price of a large drink from mcdonalds."

The way the story is told is both remarkable and adorable, and motivated me to push through tough spots that I otherwise wouldn't have. The gameplay itself is fun and cute - it fits the theme really well. Definitely worth the price I paid and the time I played. :)Also, I'm VERY happy to report that there are no messy graphics and sad sounds when the cat takes damage and dies; the game just plays cute cat sounds whenever you're hit and you just instantly respawn at the last checkpoint upon death. I'm an animal lover and a furry, so this means a lot to me! <3"

Can be quiet relaxing to play and find out the different abilities that you gain through the levels. Tight controls and motion of cat  Nice levels that ease you into the game and introduce game mechanics at a steady rate.  Story unfolds in the background of the levels as writing and gives the game extra personality and charm.The other thing that is great about this game is the developer.  The game has gotten quiet a few updates since I have owned this game.  When I posted today about an issue with the mouse cursor staying in the way on screen, the developer replied and outted a patch within an hour or so!  How cool is that? :)Support this great little gem and it's developer.  Hell, buy 13 copies of the game for freinds as another has said in their review! :)"
