Although I like the idea and hope the developer will pull through and finish the game, at its current state it's just a pain to play. Isommetric view mixed with a character that moves way to fast and enemies/objects you have to stand right infront of to hit/activate makes it just extremely annoying. Just walking through a door or hacking down a tree is a chore.I won't refund the game and really hope for the best, so that this game may shine at some point in the future. However, I wouldn't buy it at the moment and wait till a full release is out or at least a lot of updates have been made."

In most instances, cranking up the brightness/gamma settings in a game can get you around dark areas - but not in Shards of Azuria. As for the controls, combat tends to be frustrating with both mouse and keyboard. Though not as frustrating, this also goes into simply trying to open a door. I have just started out, but I am already dreading encountering tougher enemies.However... the cons are not enough for me to not enjoy the game. I am looking forward to building my house with the very user-friendly building system and seeing how strong my character can become with the things I can craft, as well as looking forward to how this game will improve on its way to a full release."
,Recommended,498340,26009222,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,Nulty!,"TL;DRShards of Azuria is a charming game with quirky characters and hours and hours of content. The controls are a little hard to get used to at first but at its price point, this game is a steal!PerformanceBeing a 2D game, the hardware capabilities of your PC aren't going to be pushed to the limit no matter what graphics card you have. Intel Integrated HD graphics should be more than enough to play this game. I personally haven't encountered any performance issues caused by any bugs. This game seems very well polished compared to a lot on the Early Access marketplace.GraphicsThis game isn't going to blow you away graphically. However, for people who are fans of pixel art, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. The enemies come in a different variety of horrible beasts that leave me curious to find more of them just to see what they look like. Back in the town, there is still some pixel wonders to behold such as the Shard itself.GameplayUnlike some similar games, Shards is a live action game (not turn-based). This makes it all the more tense when battling hoards of monsters. The landscapes are half procedurally generated which makes replayability a factor of the game.The game ships with a wide variety of abilities that allow you to go about defeating an enemy in many different ways, be it with Might, Cunning or Mysticism.You are also able to craft your own house and make it your own with the paint blaster. The crafting system is fully fledged and you are able to craft over 90 items.The controls will more than likely seem strange at first, they take a bit of getting used to. As this is an isometric game, it's tough to determine which way is UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. There is a keybindings menu available for people to change up the controls if needed!MusicThe music is reminiscent of 90s-esque RPG/Exploration games. It is definitely a welcoming, nostalgic treat."

76561198104361263,Not Recommended,498340,29224691,Posted: 13 January,all,Taddy Mason,"I really like the premise of this game. I like how it looks and I liked everything I saw in the trailer and on the store page. However, the isometric view makes this game almost impossible to play. It's extremely tedious to do something as simple as walk through a door or chop down a tree. Killing enemies is annoyingly difficult as well since you have to perfectly line up with the same row they're in or you won't hit them. I tried for a few hours to dig and mine and craft and kill enemies and none of it was fun for me because it was just so tedious to do everything. I also didn't like that everything is so dark. The torches you can craft and place don't provide enough light to be of any real use and as soon as you're a few blocks deep into a hillside, you're lost in utter darkness.That's not to say I hate the game. I want to like it-the idea and trailer looked so good, but actually playing it is too annoying and difficult, that I can't bring myself to recommend it. It IS in early access, however, so I'm curious to see how it evolves over time and if the control/gameplay kinks can be worked out. If this weird, klunky control system is how the game is supposed to function and it's not going to change, then I probably won't be coming back to play this again. I just can't get into this game if actually playing it is a chore."
76561197970755392,Recommended,498340,33052745,Posted: 30 June,all,OPUS,"Good start to a potentially good game.I'm giving this game a Thumbs Up because of its potential and because it's still in Early Access.  However, if the Developers don't read Thumbs Up reviews, then I will change it to thumbs down in hopes that they will address some issues noted below.ISSUES1.  The Object Interaction Range needs to be Increased (20-35% ?)You must be standing VERY close to objects to interact with them.  It would be helpful if the Interaction Range was increased and the ability to interact with objects wasn't so 'picky'.2.   Inventory Tips Blocked by Mini-MapThe pop-up tip for Crafting help is centered on the screen.  Nice.But almost half of the pop-up tip for the Inventory appears behind the mini-map.   Not nice.It would be better if all pop-up tips were centered on the screen.Also, it might be helpful if there was a toggle to hide the Mini-map.Additionally, I'm not able to Close the Inventory pop-up because the upper right corner with the red close button is also behind the mini-map.  Currently, I must save and exit the game, then restart to have the Inventory pop-up close.3.  Screen Resolution change not working.OK, this might be user error, but no matter how I try I can't save changes to the screen resolution.When I go to Options/Video, change the screen resolution and click Apply a pop up tells me a game restart is required for that to take effect.  Fine, many games require that.  But when I restart the game it returns to the default screen resolution.  No matter whether I save the game or not, or whether I reload the game or restart the entire app, it always resets to the default screen resolution.  Please fix.  (I'm on a desktop PC with a large monitor and have no resolution issues with 99% of other apps.)4.  Each time you talk to a Vendor, you have to left click through all the text interaction every single time before being able to buy or sell anything.   Very annoying.  Please provide a way to skip all the text after the first time you've read it.5.  Pixel Graphics do not require Pixilated Text   (Less an issue, more a personal pet peeve.)I don't mind pixel graphic games.  If a game is fun who cares if it looks ""old school.""But I wonder why developers choose to use those old pixilated fonts that look like a terrible dot matrix print out.  The text in the NPC chat windows and the Quest text is not impossible to read, it would just be nice if it was more legible.6.  I like the message scroll in the bottom left corner noting useful information, but it would be nice if the font size could be increased.  (I hoped changing the screen resolution would accomplish this, but...well, see above.)***   EDIT:  Ignore #7, found small button to set # of items to 'auto-craft'.  ISSUE SOLVED.  ***      7.  When crafting multiples of the same item, you must click the button over and over, crafting one at a time.  Please add a  Craft All  button.8.  After placing materials in the crafting window slots, if I close the crafting window, the materials do not return to my inventory.  They did remain in the crafting window so I could retrieve them, but I'm not sure if they would be there after exiting the game.I suggest auto-returning all materials from crafting slots to the player's inventory upon closing the crafting window.Although still in Early Access, this game is very playable and quite fun.  I look forward to seeing some issue fixes and whatever new things the developers have in store."

I wish i could walk through the tall grass around the town or flowers instead of getting blocked by it.

,Not Recommended,498340,34379875,Posted: 20 August,all,blh92385,"This game has many flaws. I cannot recommend it in its current state.1. The movement and combat are both extremely awkward and not fluid. There were many times when I would struggle with simple tasks like opening and closing doors because it was implemented so poorly.2. The lighting system is actually really annoying the way it is constantly shadowing things in an unrealistic way when you move around.3. There were attempts by the devs at making classes, but you can just pick all of them and have every ability which makes it overpowered and boring. I was able to beat multiple bosses with no gear upgrades at all because the abilities are overpowered and allow infinite kiting. This also discouraged me from wanting better gear because it was not needed.4. There is no multiplayer in the current build, although devs say it is being worked on.5. The building system is not impressive, it is the same as every other game - build a house, build a workbench, build other utilities which then build more boring sets of armor and weapons that you don't even need to progress in the game.6. Quests and game progress are also just plain weird. After you beat the first wave of quests, you are told to dig through a mountain that takes a while just to dig through. There seems to be no real reason to be digging through said mountain other than to waste your time. Sure you can collect some ore and kill some NPCs while you do it, but overall it feels like a task designed to waste time and is very unrewarding, much like the rest of the game.7. The NPCs are completely cookie cutter RPG characters and the storyline is non existent, you just wake up in a mystery land and don't know where you are and are told to go start killing things, building things, and doing quests for said cookie cutter NPCs.It feels like a mashup of diablo and minecraft, but fails pretty badly by having an awkward movement, lighting, and combat system."
,Recommended,498340,28592067,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,America Has A Problem #LasVegas,"A serious throwback to the 90s JRPGs of yesteryear.My only gripe with the game so far is melee combat. This stems from the cell-based structure of the game's aesthetic, so aiming with melee can be somewhat tedius. If you're not directly in front of your enemy, you won't land a single blow. Combine this with the bizzarre knockback you get everytime you bump into an enemy, and melee rapidly loses its appeal.The music and the design of the game, however, really shine. It's a heartfelt nod to all of your favorite 8/16/32bit JRPGs from the SNES/PSX and earlier gaming years. Fans of titles like Chrono Trigger will feel very comfortable here in the world of Azuria.For 5$, you most certainly get your moneys worth. There's a lot offered to keep you preoccupied: crafting, creature farming, house building (you can even plant decorative and functional flora as well) and spell crafting. Spell crafting is a very nice addition, because you can essentially craft any ability from a profession and use it regardless of what masteries you decide to pursue. So, if you're a lvl 9 billion Wizard of Icy Death, you can still pull out a rusty dagger and backstab foes if you're playstyle you chose begins to bore you.The game's charm is highly understated and it becomes evident the longer you play, slowly getting sucked in by its vintage-game copycatism. It takes modern elements of the sandbox genre and does a very good job at blending it with the old school.For 5$, you should definitely add this title to your library if you're any sort of RPG fan."

It plays alot less than modern crafters and definitely alot more like those old games you used to hang out with in the 90s.  Theres a few basic chocies with character customkization.... like hair.  Thats it really.  Honestly, for a Early Access game, and what I saw advertised on the front page, its... pretty much what youd expect from a 5 dollar game.    Cheap, unpolished, still in the works, but whats there works, in an old fashioned way...I would suggest numerous UI tweaks such as making items interchangable, and maybe reworking the way you place blocks and see tiles a bit.  Mining is a nightmare chore to go through currently because I cant tell what Im hitting in the dark spaces, or even when its not.That said, Id say this game for its price, as it is currently in Early Access, is worth a look at least."

It has a bit of a Diablo/Ragnorok feel to it which is great and I love the simplistic graphics that doesn't feel like my PC is going to fry.I will say if you are looking for a game that feels like a demo build this is for you and the price is great for the amount of content so farTrust me, its worth it.

Go where you want, when you want, even of your not a high enough level.- Decent RPG feel- destroy blocks with your spells.CONS -- Diagonal play with straight left to right map, confusing.- Aiming controls could be alot better, currently you have to be directly infront of the mob in order to hit it.- Spawn rate could be a bit less.

Classes are a bit limited to the three ""rogue wizard warrior"" but there is a bit of flexibility in mixing them up. Only 15 or so basic skills, 5 for each of the three ""classes"" but I hear in the discussions someone has found a few extra skills as drops. Once again a great framework for something really good, it would be easy to see a wide variety of classes as time goes on with development. Home building appears to be a large part of this game, it's kind of like minecraft meets everquest meets project zomboid. Once the basics are polished this game could turn into something really really ♥♥♥♥ing awesome if time and effort keeps pumping into the game. This brings me to devlopment... looks like it's a one man team but the devloper is pretty vocal and active with the small community. There are a few unpolished tings like torches and how much they light up caves and the control scheme is a little wonky (he's been updating this and taking suggestions btw) but he seems to be focused and on task. It's a bit early to see how regular he is with updates or if any new content is in the works... but for $4.99 it's totally worth checking out and fooling around with."

That said like many reviews that start with ""This game has potential"" the game needs ALOT of work.I recognize it is in alpha but I have played this game several times over the past few months and not much has changed yet.It is not very intuitive. There are multiple funtions that do not quite feel right when being used. For example if you get within one tile of a wall the screen gets really dark. This does not make alot of sense in many situations and internal lighting on buildings is something much more suited to cavernous dungeon crawling. The game needs distinction. The in game terrain also does not become transparent when you walk behind it. This causes you to be unable to see enemies or even items around you.Speaking of items you cannot pickup things individually. You just hit a button and everything in the vicinity sort of floats towards you. This is frustrating when you do not want all the random stuff around. Combat is also not very smooth the attacking and facing system is once again just not quite polished enough to be fun or functional.All in all the game is alright and I feel like it would be very fun if it fixed alot of its rough edges."
