It's smooth, it has a well-designed combot mechanic. So nothing to complain about. And the overall review rating is very positive.On the not so bright side, music is generic and a bit boring and it seems to be a bit short. I will update on this point when I finished the game. I mostly need longer to finish a game than the average Steam gamer. Don't know why. ;DTotally recommend for the sale price of 2.99 EUR. Maybe even full price. But I have to test more."
,Recommended,498500,29326590,Posted: 17 January,all,Tetsuo9999,"A solid but flawed beat-em-up that came out of nowhere. Great pixel art, fun combat, and a good overall presentation make it worth the asking price. However, the game will be polarizing for many. If you enjoy beat-em-ups that are more grounded and less combo-heavy, this isn't the game for you. If you like fast-paced action games with a combo system that allows the player to make their own identity in combat, you'll love this game despite its flaws. There are a large amount of unlockables and online co-op for the Workshop (think Bloody Palace), along with three difficulties for the single player campaign. For $10 you'll get about 3-4 hours out of the first mode of the campaign, and many more if you choose to unlock everything and go for records on the Workshop mode.Sadly, the game isn't without its flaws. The movement controls are mapped to the left analog stick by default, but this can be easily fixed via the Steam beta client. Even with the movement changed to the d-pad, the game seems to have difficulty reading certain inputs, which can lead to disaster if you're trying to get a super move out in a pinch. Bosses are a mixed bag with invincible supers (although the player has these as well) and seemingly random rules for when they stagger and when they have super armor. This makes the ground combat borderline useless on them without taking a risk, and charge attacks or supers are the only semi-guaranteed way to start a combo. They will also tech out of juggles at random instead of at set times, which can be frustrating if you stagger them with a super and don't get to capitalize on it for full damage. The defensive options are lacking; you have a tech roll that spends your super meter, a dash with a significant cooldown, a hyper armor mode that also increases the character's speed, and a pursuit move in the air that doubles as an airdash. None of these defensive options seem to help much against the bosses or large crowds of enemies; if you dash through one enemy and whiff your dash attack, the long recovery will put you in trouble. Punishing a boss after dodging their super feels off since there's no guarantee you can get any significant damage off it. When the bosses don't stagger for long periods of time or basic enemies combo you, it often feels like the game is missing a few mechanics. The offensive options are solid, but the defensive options feel half-baked. In general, the boss battles feel slow-paced and a bit too random given how controlled everything else is. The critical mechanic is supposed to serve as your main crowd control tool, but due to the vague timing to execute it, it feels more like a random bonus. If the enemies had an indication/tell for the timing, it would be a much more viable tool for the second half's large crowds and difficult to stagger bosses. While this is nothing that couldn't get fixed in a patch, the game starts to feel a bit unfair and random towards the end of the second half.The difficulty curve is high and it definitely rewards execution, but the aforementioned issues can sometimes make it feel like taking damage isn't entirely your fault. For the asking price there's a lot of content to go through, but seeing as the game is quite difficult on the first difficulty, factoring the other two modes into the overall replay value may not go well for anyone but the most experienced beat-em-up fans. The developers are open to feedback, so hopefully these issues will be ironed out in due time. These games don't come out often, so definitely support it if you can. The passion in this game is obvious in every aspect, from the art style to the animation and gameplay, but the flaws may turn some people away.I finished the campaign in about three hours with some deaths and running through a few levels extra times for Youtube footage. The campaign is long for the genre, but the solid combat keeps it fresh. It can easily be finished in one sitting, but playing through it in chunks might be better due to what the game asks of the player. I will update this review if the boss mechanics and control issues are fixed."

,Recommended,498500,31363445,Posted: 25 April,all,Engine Nine,"This game is pretty damn cool.  It is a great example of how you can take an old genre like the side scrolling beat-em-up and really enhance it without feeling stale or losing what made those games great 25 years ago.It adds combos, juggles, launches, air juggles, EX moves, and other words that are reminiscent of fighting games, but all done in a way that even an uncoordinated fool (like me) can pull them off with regularity so you feel powerful and cool.It also has swaths of style in the presentation and bits of humor with all the enemies and some attacks.  I haven't finished it yet, obviously, but there are plenty of playable characters and EX moves to unlock."
,Not Recommended,498500,29934919,Posted: 14 February,all,Teru,"I was loving this game, I was so in love with it right away that I wanted to do a review immediately. The graphics are cute, the jokes are funny, the gameplay is pretty solid and flashy for a beat 'em up. That's when I hit 4-2. 4-2 is a super long elevator ride with a bottomlest pit that restarts you all the way at the top and enemies that love to kick you long distances. Then it suddenly all broke down;1/ The enemies tend to stunlock you, I noticed this earlier but dismissed it because I could fight back. The way you usually get out of it is the Phantom Dodge, a recovery dash, out of the ground. I say usually because the move has a pretty big range and will almost always dash you off the WAY TOO SHORT elevator platform which means you're left victim to being hit and kicked off the platform anyway, yeah you can be hit on the ground, no invincibility frames.2/ That's not too bad though, if you get lucky you can spam your Forward+Light move and doing so will simply push the enemies off the platform, however, if you're not fast enough, a rather large mob can gather and most enemies have the ability to kick you around so you'll fall right quick too. They also all have quite a bit of health which works normally to pull of nice combos but you don't want to do that because:3/ A lot of your offensive techniques move you around the screen a whole lot and if you cut a combo short you'll be stuck, inresponsive for about a half second, enough to.. you guessed it, get kicked off the elevator and start all over. So either you ♥♥♥♥ yourself or you get ♥♥♥♥ed as it turns out. This is especially bad with later mobs, the first few waves are fine, simple enemies you can kick off pretty easily. It's when the large boxers with super armour and multiple assassins and hooded guys who can just kick you off the platform if they so choose that there's a problem.I can't recommend this game, the music is amazing, the art and gameplay are really good, but that elevator ride is egregious enough that it easily ruined the whole experience for me and at this point I haven't finished it, nor do I plan to. I get that it's meant to be arcadey and all but that's just bad game design, either put checkpoints on it or make it reduce your health but not kill you. Otherwise it's unbeatable unless you're absolutely perfect AND get good AI RNG."

Buy it if you want to support the devs. Finished it in under 2 hours and will be getting a refund. Wasnt worth the price tag for so little contentPros+++Retro graphics+++Soundtrack++Story++Level design/Progression+Decent variety of enemies+Old school feelCons---Combat: Fun at the start but gets boring fast, revolves around juggling/stun locking enemies. Lacks depth. The only real block you have costs energy, no grappling/throwing enemies, ZERO usably weapons its your fists all game. Some older beat em up games have better combat than this. Falls short when compared to modern games of the same genre like Shank that offers so much more. By the time you learn all the cool moves the game is pretty much over and you are done with it. Late game bosses often require cheesy tactics like stun locking them in a corner otherwise they are a pain to beat and take forever--Environnement: Lack of breakable items. No weapons/items to pick up and use/throw. Only 2(3) kinds of powerup items +HP and +Energy and some green goo that makes you feel weird but does nothing.--Game lenght: Finished in less than 2 hours--Lack of online coop: Storymode coop would have added replayability.-Weird end of level rewards: You get to choose between 1 new combat move for your main char or unlock 1 new character (which is not a new hero but instead 1 type of enemy/boss youve beaten). The new char comes with much more restricted combat moves that makes combat even more bland and repetitive, so they are only worth unlocking for the sake of trying a new char.Also you dont get to choose which skill you unlock, so theres 0 character customizationTL;DR : Good attempt for a beat em up game, but falls short when compared to other modern fighting games like Shank."

,Recommended,498500,29677842,Posted: 3 February,all,AceUnbound,"Video Review Here:YouTube ReviewI am the hero presents itself as a tongue in cheek 8 bit beat em up where you take on the role of “hero” who travels through time and worlds looking to beat up bad guys. From the start, the story immediately dismisses itself as there is no true motivation. Perhaps this was for the best however as the game’s current translations leave a lot to be desired. Many of the story sequences fall flat as the translated text made me tilt my head trying to understand exactly what they were going for. I am the hero begins to show its stuff however, in its sharp and deliberate design.Each environment and enemy are inspired and full of life. From the outset, a sign showcasing the controller layout blips into existence in an organic and interesting way. It immediately caught my eye and gave instructions without taking away from the game itself. Later, there are some minor tutorials but giving that up before the game began was a nice and novel touch. The core gameplay, as mentioned before, is a beat em up where your character has access to the typical arsenal including punches, kicks, and grabs as well as a whole lot more. The developers seem to be fans of street fighter however as they also added in certain button prompts that can activate EX moves as well as air juggles.The EX attacks can be done by doing a quarter circle forward and an action when you have enough meter. The whole system takes a little getting used to but once I got enough experience in, I became able to juggle and manage hordes of enemies at once. Hero also has access to a juggernaut type ability that makes him unable to be stopped during combos and was essential for certain encounters.The bosses in the game are the true adversaries as they embody the full ambiance of the level and often have ex attacks of their own.  It was satisfying to be able to also juggle these bad boys after a little effort and effectively get rewarded for our increasing skill with the game. While the game does suffer from some minor text translations, the combat and visual style more than make up for it. What stood out most to me was how sharp and amazing the sound design was. Specifically on one level, you can hear the footsteps on the water as well as thunder in the distance. Not to mention every punch sounds meaty and adds a nice weighty feel to the combos.Overall, great game and I hope they can fix the tiny translations within it to really make it an even better game. Recommended to anyone who wants to give it a shot. There is a slight difficulty curve around 4-2 but as a masochist gamer, I enjoyed the change of pace."
,Recommended,498500,32789695,Posted: 25 June,all,Smik,"* Well-Crafted Crazy Combo Streetfighter Beat-em Up *I bought this game during the Steam Sale after a friend of mine demo'd it.  I was always kind of interested in it and would highly recommend purchasing at full price unless your funds are extremely limited.The game is cute, well animated, with a lot of thought put into the combo system.  In short, this is the game River City Underground wants to be (as it sure as heck does't seem to want to be River City Ransom).  Button mashing won't avail you here; you need to time your moves and execute your combos precisely if you want to really string them together, but even a raw noob like myself can still eek together a 100-hit combo.This is a game where with practice and finese you can really make some impressive looking fighting sequences.  The enemies become playable and it shows in their design as they all have enough moves on their own to be viable, and they are a great assistance since they're your only equivalent to a second life -- having separate power meters and life guages.  They can be tagged in easily, and while nowhere near as versatile or as overall powerful as The Hero they are still quite usable and in some instances are extremely helpful.Lots of very fine pixel animation, a pounding soundtrack, a good sense of humour and excellent pacing.  This arcade game-play at its finest, discarding the bad and keeping the good.The only criticisms I have at this moment is that you can't out-right skip the cutscenes -- not that they're BAD but after a point you just want to keep the beat-down flowing."

76561198173606567,Not Recommended,498500,33420390,Posted: 9 July,all,KeinSchiesse,"I Am the Hero is a solid beat-em-up game with well-done pixel art and fitting sound effects and music. Unfortunately for me, after having completed the main game and enjoying ~parts~ of it, such as the funky character design and the combo heavy combat system, I also couldn't help but feel like the game ""tried too hard"" to convey its coolness. Being able to charge up a heavy-hitting Falco Punch / Shoryuken esque uppercut is cool and all, but it's nothing that hasn't been seen elsewhere before. The enemies bouncing around the screen after particularly heavy attacks is cool, and some of the boss fights have fun patterns / attacks to them to dodge, but I felt like every encounter in the game -and the game at large- was pretty forgettable in hindsight.The locations of the levels have some variety, from fighting on desolate streets at night to lab areas, but large swaths of the levels also feel like they lack any distinction and have just been copy and pasted to draw out their length. This aside, the game's main story mode clocks in at a bit under 2 hours to complete, which is in line with the length of other beat em up titles, but at the 9.99 price tag you're not getting a lot of content.You are able to select to learn a new skill or the option to swap to a new character at the end of levels, which I often chose to opt for the new characters. These are fun to use as they each have their own set of useful attacks, such as a body-building, effeminate character in a leotard or a G type character with reversed hat, shades, chains, and breakdancing / crip-walking attacks. The G character cracked me up the most of what was present in the game, but from a brooding, silent, raincoat-wearing enemy to a 'mad scientist' boss, many of the game's portrayals of characters felt very overdone and cliche to me. They fit their purpose, but they do very little to break the mold or provide anything new or fresh, despite however much insistence the game keeps heaping on that it's so cool and stylish.I didn't hate my time spent playing the game and its pixel art from the characters to the backgrounds is all well done, with fitting sound effects and music. I enjoyed myself initially with this game but felt like I was just finishing it after the first couple of levels to do so rather than really being all that interested in what the next levels or enemies would be. It's not a bad game, it just didn't add up to anything very memorable or enjoyable for me."

It completely lacks story and characterization.Takes about 2 hours to complete.Bought for two bucks, can't say I disliked it. But I can't recommend it when there's much better uses of time."
,Not Recommended,498500,29326023,Posted: 17 January,all,Arkterus,"A little too wacky for my tastes.  The game also has this horribly long buffering time where you'll end up executing moves just because you tilted up on the stick.  It functions similarly to Smash Bros, where directions inputs change up some attacks...which is good in theory.Trying to execute a simple combo like Punch, Punch, Up+Kick, VERY often has you actually performing a Punch, Up+Punch because of this.  It's pretty hard to get in specific directional moves and makes for a unsatisfying experience.Also, you can't remap directions from the Analog to the D-Pad by default.  While I normally wouldn't care AS much, the ""EX-Moves"" (Supers) are formatted in something like ""Down, Forward, Punch"". If you try a Hadouken/QCF input, the move doesnt come out...it uses the old school ""mortal kombat"" input, where you have to tap Down, then Forwards to get it to work.While I enjoy the juggling aspect, the issue of this format (and other games similar to it) is that it puts too much emphasis on it; air juggling enemies infinitely more or less takes the challenge out of it and the only way some enemies and bosses can counter this is by having random moments where they become invincible and dash out of the combo.The super-moves are nice, but since they're trouble to execute, and since air juggling is much better 9 times out of 10, you're better off just juggling...or waiting until you unlock the Air EX move so you can juggle and chain it into a super.No grapples, either, but that's a personal gripe.  If you want a game where you -can- juggle, but dont -have- to, and want a game that feels more solid over-all, albeit slightly buggy, check out Devil's Dare.Most of these issues can be cleared up in a few patches, but I'd stay away for now.I can let the translation slide, as it's a beat 'em up and who cares."
,Recommended,498500,29331585,Posted: 17 January,all,SuperJakendo,"This game is simply one of the most satisfying beat-em-ups I've ever played. Lots of moves, awesome pixel-animations, and incredbily satisfying combos and sound effects. The big combos require some time and effort to get used to, though. Once you get past the learning curve, you'll find yourself doing crazy combos right and left. There's three difficulty settings, each one unlocked after completing the one before it. Beating the game on each difficulty actually reveals different endings. Just good luck with beating critical mode. It's not really fun or fair. Also, the unlockable characters are a little underwhelming. Only a handful of them are actually somewhat useful in combat.In summary, I can say that this game is a solid beat-em-up experience. I'm kind of itching for more bosses and levels in the future. The one thing that bothers me about the game though, is its story.- SPOILERS -Beating the game on critical mode was not only a painful experience, but a bittersweet victory as well. I got the achievements and unlocked some new characters, but the ending you get for beating critical mode felt like a giant middle finger. I don't know what to believe, was the adventure real? Was it all a kid's imagination? Does the adventure actually mean nothing and was the main character dead from the start? I love the game's style and such, and I still find it very fun to play, it's just that these questions and that ending really do bother me. Just a personal thing I wanted to mention."

As in most beat-em-ups, I expected original characters, here you get nothing like that.Then the fighting becomes very repetitive pretty fast, OK, the enemies have slightly different behaviour; but for my taste, everything is just to similiar, after a while I totally lost my motivation to play, also there is no too interesting story. To compare: Mother Russia Bleeds got me really hooked, there always were surprises and twists. Here just bland/boring and repetitive gameplay; and when that happens, I start to ask myself, why am I even playing?Don't understand me wrong, it's not the worst game ever, it's not a really bad game per se, but there are so many others, better ones, with similiar concepts; and I can't recommend a game, I probably won't play ever again, far from having finished it."

,Recommended,498500,29483232,Posted: 25 January,all,Pramitz,"Side note: I played through the entire game with an arcade stick (hori rap4)Other reviews mention getting stunlocked, but if you have just a little bit of meter you can dodge away when hit, which recovers you. Or enter endure, where you don't flinch at all when hit. So they were just♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game, not the games fault at all. I also have seen people complain about input delay? I have no idea what they are talking about tbqh, I didn't notice any whatsoever (maybe the fight stick+gaming monitor has something to do with it being good for me)A bit short, imo (3 hours on my first playthrough, the time of writing this review, and I got stuck at one part for maybe 30 minutes that was pretty tough) but I guess most beat 'em ups are short, it isn't really a genre I like. This was an exception though, I fell in love with this game.That said, I still feel far from done playing. There is plenty more to do. I still have characters to unlock, along with quite a few moves, and I am excited to try the next difficulty level, even though I died many times at the standard level. Worth the $10What I like:-Tons of fun to pull off the air combos, you can make them very, very long, and it is satifying when you do it right-I love the art/style. Good animations, character design, enviornments, the whole shebang-I love how fast paced it is, you can really zoom around the screen once you get the hang of it-Terrific music, I hope the soundtrack is release I wanna buy it-Had some humor, which was often made even funnier by the translation, but some of the jokes themselves were good too-The choice between unlocking EX moves or a character at the end of a level is an awesome idea (the characters won't be as good as your main character, for the most part, but you can switch to them whenever, and once you die they come in basically acting as an extra life, giving you a chance to finish off whatever killed you and the level. You can only have the hero and 1 other character at a time though, having a bunch of lives would be too easy)-The meter system is good, you can use it do dodge after being hit so you don't get combo'd (takes a very small amount of meter to do this), preform EX moves, or my favorite: the endure status. When you activate it, your meter starts to drain, and you attack faster plus you don't flinch when hit, you can just continue your combo.What I didn't like:-At the end of the game, final boss, after my main character died, my backup got switched in, but the sound effects stopped working. There was only music. I then died, and when I started again there was no music OR sound, except for 1 sound effected when I beat the boss. Final scene played, confirmed unlocks, then I went back to the main menu, neither of those had sound either. Pretty anticlimatic, thanks to that. I should have restarted the game when it first happened instead of continuing. However, that was the only glitch I experienced while playing.-I found it difficult to input the EX moves. Using a fight stick might have had something to do with it, it wasn't smooth like street fighter at all. I tend to stick to just using my meter to activate Endure, for the most part, as I found that to be very good-Menu UI and the information within them could be better, no big deal though. Just play the game.I really did fall in love with this game, and it is exceptionally good. Only 3 guys made it (art guy, sound guy, code guy) and each of them did a great job with their part of it. I hope Crazyant stays together, and puts out more games of this quality."

,Recommended,498500,33319931,Posted: 6 July,all,The-Lost-Demon,"Worth a buy at full price.The gameplay is tight, the combos feel just like the ones in Street Fighter, the visual are beautiful, the music is badass (mix of metal with techno like the DOOM OST), there's a good amount of variety on the enemies and it supports local co-op.I recommend it if you're looking for a cool but short fighting game to play and if you want you can always replay on the harder dificulties or play the online challenges.I think that the game should be bigger and the characters that you unlock should stay in a library of sorts so you can select which one you want to bring along with you, there's also some spelling and gramatical errors on the hints.Overall i give it a 8/10"

I liked the combat, but I didn't like that the enemies are so silly. They are having spring loaded guns with a boxing glove and wrestlers who are trying to attack you with a kiss..I edited the two first levels in 10minutes long video if you want to see some of this;https://youtu.be/ZlTsFJhxxkM"

It's got stuns that basically render you unable to move until you eventually die. In certain levels you are almost bound to have to try repeatedly (I'm looking at you elevator level) and getting through is just more about being lucky than having skill. I got around that level only to find myself in a similar situation a half an hour later. I wanted a beat em up game to have some release from competitive gaming but this is just more rage inducing. The other characters are also very disappoiting. They're literally the bad guys' characters. I mean, pretty lazy but I guess it didn't hurt. There is not much of a story. The visiuals are pretty nice.Don't buy this game."

The fighting is somehow both awkward AND repetitive, and while I can usually handle one or the other, the combination is horrifying. Online gameplay seems more like a tech demo than an actual gamemode, and I will be refunding this product ASAP."

We are talking guns shooting spring loaded boxing gloves and people getting hit and bouncing around the screen like pinballs. Way to ""zany"" for my tastes.

Windowed mode is buggy too: the picture doesn't fully fit into the window, hence invisible areas on the sides, including parts of game interface (e.g. ""combo"" text on the right).2) Couldn't find config files in standard locations (linux). Ignores Unity config file.3) Slightly unresponsive controls with a Logitech F310 controller.Gameplay-wise it cannot be compared to games like Double Dragon or BattleToads, despite some other reviews.
