76561197972711665,Recommended,498570,32725862,Posted: 24 June,all,Gunnyshark,"Let me start off by saying I haven't forked this much since I was in my 20's. What a great game about forking. I was banking on this being another run of the mill simulator but boy was I wrong. After about 10 minutes I knew I was addicted to forking. I ended up forking all night, almost wore out my mouse. Had to use a lotion to prevent the inevitable callouses I was going to get.The gameplay was amazing! Some of the missions were so climatic I would get nervous and drop my load all over the warehouse floor. Without giving away any spoilers, there was one mission where the office manager came into the warehouse and she was yelling at all of the packers and shippers. I quietly drove up and forked her from behind. Lost several reputation points but it was worth it. I did get stuck in one mission though. The shop boss asked me to fork a crate full of goats and I told him some lines could not be crossed. He said the goats were dead so I was able to finish.I haven't needed any real help yet but I read that if you cant finish a certain part, there are people that fork professionally to help you, but you lose a lot of health if you go that route.I was really hoping for multiplayer options so my wife could play too. She said it was no big deal, I could just go fork myself. This game really is for everyone, even the lady across the street wants to try forking sometime, although I don't think her husband is that keen on it.One thing to remember, operating heavy machinery is a very serious responsibility, not an issue to be taken lightheartedly. You should always use the proper protection to prevent any risk to your health."

You're picking up and moving pallets around one map, that's it, and I get that. The game isn't trying to be something it's not. I'm not recommending the game at full price as there just isn't much content but if it goes on sale with a solid discount and you -really- liked the forklift section of Shenmue (90% of why I bought this), you probably won't regret the purchase."

There is nothing more relaxing and enjoyable than forklifting after a long day of forklifting. The only thing i wish is the pnumatic tanks would run out and have to be refilled for that extra bit of realism!

After spending a whopping 18 minutes on the game I can say that this is the best forlifting expierence I've ever had, from lifting pallets to dropping them this game covers it all.

Of those various things today, this is the one which has given me the most enjoyment. I kind of feel bad for getting it for half off. I actually came back to the store page to buy a copy for a friend, but I guess the sale had ended, so I figured I would write a review instead.This is a fun little casual game. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it. It's funny, entertaining, and for achievement hunters, it's a fun, easy list. The physics, graphics, and controls are all really excellent for the level of game this is, and it will run great even on a toaster. Since you are interested in the concept of this game enough to be reading reviews of it, you should buy it. It's well worth the price."

There is nothing extreme about this game, you are in one warehouse environment picking up crates and delivering them to their destination at random points across the map. This is just like a normal job, nothing different from REGULAR FORKLIFTING. this is an EXTREME case of false advertising. BUYER BEWARE!(although this game does do a good job of replicating the mundane banality of a warehouse job with not much else to do but keep your head down and make cash)As a real life simulator I give it 10/10 RECOMMENDEDNOT EXTREME THOUGH"

And I was surprised in a positive way. This simulator/game is actually a little bit fun. But it could have been so much more, if they put a little more time and effort into it.Graphics and audio is allright. The soundeffects is ok, and the single tune is catchy. They could have added a couple of tunes more, but I doubt most of the owners of this game will play past a couple of hours. There could have been some more details, for example a bit more shelves, and trucks/trains to load the pallets onto. The elevators could have been detailed to something more than just a moving slab.Controls are ok with keyboard. But I guess it is better played with an analog gamepad, as you tend to do a 360 with the keyboard. I am looking forward trying this with a steering wheel, though! The general gameplay is a bit lacking, though. After a while, you're just playing to get the achivements. As I pointed out about the graphics, if they detailed the area a bit more, with more shelves, and different things to load onto, it would have been a lot more interesting. Filled shelves with multiple pallets, and all moveable would have been nice. The ability to cause total havoc by making the shelf fall over would be even more hillarious. But what can you expect from a $1.5 game?And what's up with a forklift with side-shift but no tilt? I had to drive backwards down the steep ramps so I did not lose the pallet."

And in this game, you pick things up, move them, then put them down.  The game runs well with no obvious bugs or glitches, it looks OK and the controls are well-sorted. The lift behaves basically as it should (and as someone who has experience driving an actual forklift, I do know what I'm talking about here)The only truly unrealistic thing I've found is that all the loads on the pallets are properly strapped down and secured. If my experience is any indication, this almost NEVER happens in real life.If you have 2 bucks burning a hole in your pocket and you've always wanted to know what it's like to drive a forklift, knock yourself out. Otherwise don't bother--you are getting EXACTLY what it says on the tin and not a drop more."
