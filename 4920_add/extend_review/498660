It's easy, but still not too easy to play trough.Levels are designed well, they look good and you really have to think how to get trough some of them. Design of the whole game is really nice, it's relaxing and beautiful. I purchased the  soundtrack too when buying this, I can recommend that also if buying this game.Ofc all games have something bad in them, so does this too. When you are moving the triangle objects its so hard, they move very rapidly and it's hard to place them right sometimes. I have not seen any bugs etc. so far.Last but not least if you like solving puzzles and playing simple games that can help you relax, this is really a game for you. My grade for this game 7,5/10"

It is not.Everything is already placed and all you have to do is rotate each item so the ball can make it to the finish. Sound easy? It is very easy... I wish you started with the items in an inventory and had to place them to make the path for the ball. That would give it a little more challenge.If you want a game that takes under 45 minutes to beat 50 levels, and super easy achievements, then this is the game for you."

It's a challenging physics puzzle, quite difficult actually, where you have to get the ball from the start to the end by moving and placing various numbers of platforms.. if you like minimal flash/puzzle games this is a nice addition to your list :) Of course, we have seen these kind of games hundreds of times on Flash websites and so on but this one is a little bit different and it's not a copy of anything else!"

,Recommended,498660,24634966,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,kariann,"This is a quick and easy puzzle game that you can do a little bit of and feel great. The puzzles are fairly simple and straight forward, but it's a fun exercise while waiting for something to install or just a moment of down time. The rotation of background and 3D objects might not be OK for everyone. Right now ""Great Schematics"" level 6, the 36th puzzle has a design flaw that traps the ball in a loop of up-the-ramp behavior because the bounce at the bottom of the ramp isn't strong enough. Neither peice is movable, but up to this point it was nice to spend 10 minutes here or there playing.  Because I cannot skip a puzzle, the rest of the game is locked. It came in a bundle, so no real loss, but it would have been great to have gone forwrad.Overall the game was nice and the kids enjoy the challenge themselves."

76561198035566667,Recommended,498660,24190050,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Aegonn,"Mind Spheres is a cool concept and very decent for the price. It reminds me of one of my favorite physics puzzlers Enigmo. However I ran into some issues with the game during play that make it diffifult/cumbersome.For starters I am playing this on mac and starting around level 9 periodically the screen would go completely white and I couldn't see the puzzle anymore. You could click spacebar to initiate the sequence but then hitting R to reload would make the screen go white again. The only solution I found was to restart the game entirely.Secondly, the game the board each time you attempt the puzzle so you can't make small tweaks to execute the puzzle correct. You have to start from scratch each time.Last point - given there are multiple ways to solve the puzzle it would be fun to have a timer to show how fast you were able to solve the puzzle. Alternatively, achievements could be awarded for taking the most round-a-bout way.I really like this genre of games but I think it may require a couple of tweaks before recommending to a friend. Please keep making games like this though!---EDIT---After reviewing all of the updates that the developer has made, I would recommend this game to a frieend. I really like having the 'saved states' so that you do not need to recreate your work all the time and I have not experienced the white screen crashing as noted before. I still wouldn't mind seeing a timer and challenges eventually added but great work on the updates! Thanks."

,Recommended,498660,26327856,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Jack,"Took me 67 minutes to beat this game, but ya know what? At $0.49 it was cheaper than most arcade games.This was a pretty fun puzzle/physics game; it did keep my attention enough to beat it over two play sessions.My only complaint is that the game is too easy and doesn't reach its full potential. I was only challenge on the last few levels and even then, it was more of a game of getting the physics to work and less of a puzzle game. The game could use more levels with alternative ways to win. Also, free DLC with some bloody hard maps would be nice!!At $0.49 on sale or $2 regular price, you're still going to get your moneys worth."
76561197961446046,Recommended,498660,28740821,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Why_me,"this is $2 normally or 0.50 on sale currently...I figure should take around 1-2 hrs to beat it. 90% of the levels are very easy to the point it is more of a watch the ball bounce around. Sometimes you have fun with the engine when things go just a bit off and the ball starts bouncing around wildly, sometimes in your favor sometimes not....To me it was 1.6hrs of relaxation of watching a ball bounce down almost effortlessly on my part and .1 hrs of somewhat frustration on a pixel being off and having the ball get stuck on one level.Well worth 0.50...."

,Recommended,498660,31162199,Posted: 15 April,all,aeko,"I bought this game on sale last weekend for about 49 cents. I got the chance to try it out today and I must say it is a very nice game with about 50 puzzle levels or so. It begins as easy, in my opinion. You can learn very quickly the mechanics on the game which are simple and effective. For me the game is quite easy, only challenging part was the Eternal Loops (last part). The soundtrack for me is quite nice as well, very well done on the piano playing. I can't really find any negative aspect on the gameAll in all, I give this game 10/10 taking in consideration the following aspects:-Challenge-Price-Achievements-Steam trade cards-FunI recommend it to everyone who is trying to relax and play a nice little game for about an hour in order to complete it paying just the price of a beer."
,Recommended,498660,32377257,Posted: 12 June,all,CascadeHush,"A thumbs up, but only just.Relaxing puzzle game that is difficult enough to be interesting but easy enough to be completable.Each 10 levels is supposed to represent a different set or theme, but they just look the same. A simple colour change for some of the elements would have added some visual interest and provided more of a sense of progression.Some levels come down to very fine movement of elements, with a lot of trial and error, which is both fiddly and tedious. A tweak to the control scheme for the triangular rotating elements is needed, and a fast forward control (such as 2x speed) would be nice.But those small points aside, this a decent game. Put it on your wishlist and grab it when it goes on special for $1."

One hicup though, after 27 minutes of playing it was using a lot of memory, so I restarted it. {A game level went white and I couldn't manipulate the puzzle pieces.} Don't let that get you down though. It's only 30 seconds to back out to shut it down and restart it.For a the price of a cup of coffee { $2 }, no one can complain and I'm sure the memory leakage will be corrected.Two thumbs up!"
