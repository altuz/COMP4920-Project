76561197993052607,Recommended,499230,24662792,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,MojoPain,"This game is about atmosphere and the stories you come away with. So here's my tale.I awaken in the sleeping quarters. The ship's computer telling me some kind of alien organism is on board. I scramble out the door, waving a pistol down both ends of the corrider. Seeing nothing I take off running down the metal decks of the ship, my foot steps echoing much louder than I'd like.  I turn a corner and meet with a couple of my crew, Brice and Joe. The three of us know the alien can take on human form, so naturally we point guns in eachother's faces.The stand off is cut short though as machine gun fire is heard rattling off in the distance. We three immediately lower our guns, an instant truce being formed. We take off sprinintg to see where the gunfire is coming from, and as we spin around a corner we are rooted to the ground at what we see. A frantic marine is pouring round after round into what I can only describe as a 'Thing'. The marine is decimated, the gore covering the bulkheads. The thing whips its terrible head around to us and charges. We open fire. Bullets tear through the charging beast and it drops just short of Brice's trembling feet.As we take a breather a larger group of 5 crew members shows themselves from a far off corridor. They have no trust of the three of us. Brice approached them and  tried to reason with them, that we need to stick together and that the threat, for now, lay dead. But he's shoved back by a paranoid looking mechanic wielding a make shift flamethrower. He was right to be paranoid. We are led to the canteen of the ship under gun point. Meters from the entrance a horrid scream erupts from beside me. Joe lays dead. Behind him a sickly alien appendage has erupted out of the chest of a member of the other group. One of THEM was infected! The paranoid mechanic's mind breaks, he panics. A torrent of flame washes over alien and human alike. Waves of intense heat firing out in random directions as he tries to burn his fear away.Brice yells at me to get out of here so I take off running with him. A scientist. and a couple of marines follow along behind us. We regroup in the machine room and it's not long till Brice and I are backing away from the other survivors. The scientist sensing the tension annouced that he's got a way of testing to see if someone is really who they say they are. We all agree to let the doc try it out and take off running for the med lab, our eyes sternly watching eachother as much as the dark corridors around us.At med lab me and Brice tell the others to stay in the corner while the scientist does his work. One of the marines mentions a sentry gun could be placed covering the only hallway into med lab. Keeping an eye on him me and Brice allow him to set it up. Med lab is locked down and it's only a matter of holding out and waiting for the blood test. A couple of those creatures tried getting down the hall, but between the sentry and our rifles they stood no chance. Things seemed set.Klaxons started, emergency lights swirled, and the ship's computer calmly announced a fire had started on the bridge. We all panicked, that fire had to be put out. Brice picked up an extinguisher and sprinted out of med lab. No one else followed, so cursing I ran after him to back my friend up, running away from the safe zone. Brice was ahead of me and not slowing down one bit. As I tried to keep up with him the ship's lighting grew dimmer in these sections. I faintly heard the sound of the sentry gun kicking off back in med lab, but I was already committed to my task. Smoke started filling the corridors and with the lack of lighting I started to feel disorientated. I forced myself on, barely keeping track of the twists and turns Brice took as he grew further ahead of me. To hell with the others I thought, me and Brice are the ones risking our lives to put this fire out, we deserve to be the ones to survive. The hanger isn't far from the bridge section anyway, we can do this.Still running I turned a corner and slowed. At the entrance to the bridge Brice just stood there in the stygian smoke holding the used extinguisher. The computer announced the dangerous state of the bridge had been contained. Excitedly I walked over to Brice and told him we had to go! The fire was out, we can get out of here now! He turned around to me, dropping the extinguisher and said ''I was waiting for us to be alone''.A slithering jagged mess exploded out of his chest impaling me. I slumped to the cold metal floor. The last sight I had was seeing Brice walking toward the hanger to get in the escape shuttle. Of course I know now, that it wasn't Brice.SOOOoooo yeah, that's the game. That ended up being much longer than I thought, but fun to write."

The Cultist has his/her own objectives that may be to translate artifacts or kill people (I'm not so sure on this  part) though I do know that they can have a mutated figure and may cause confusion, last of all is the marine pretty self explainatory run and gun.Now heres the cool thing, the infected is also in the form of a human, and what this means is he/she can also slowly creep up on people, acting friendly then bam! Tentacle to the face! Or take the long approach, and upgrade themselves by using the class systems as well.The game is tons of fun~! Absolutely would recommend it, especially if you are, or aren't into tentacle stuff.One con would be no female characters, but that'd make this game over 21+ so other than that good game.10/10."
,Not Recommended,499230,26307109,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,Aurumlamina,"I was quite excited about the premise of this game. Unfortunately, when I started it up there was no one to play with. Literally no one was playing the game. That's a bit of a problem for a multiplayer game. I still hopped in for about ten minutes and ran around a map to check out the basic mechanics at least.After I was done experimenting I went to the forums and brought up the population of the servers and asked about who enjoyed playing the game and if there was a way to get into a game with some other people. A developer responded to me and informed me that the lack of population was currently standard and that there is a Discord chat for the small community which had about twenty-five people on it. I asked if anyone was interested in playing, waited about twenty minutes, checked back on the forum, and then decided to request a refund from Steam.The game could have potential in the future and yes, it is Early Access, but currently, you won't even be able to play it unless you bring an entire squad of friends with you from the start. I really hope that some day I'll pick this game back up and it will be great but for now I felt that I needed to leave this buyer-beware review."

It pits humans against a disguised alien, a la The Thing. The prime alien must infect every other player  - turning them into more aliens - to win. The humans must survive as long as possible, as the escape shuttle only has one seat!The developer is attentive to the game, and pays attention to bug reports and feedback.

76561198027289728,Recommended,499230,29103408,Posted: 7 January,all,Fatalfox,Im never really good at writing reviews but I will try to explain my experience with the game. It does need work of course it is a alpha so that is understandable. But it is a extremely fun and well made game that is still being worked on. The developers talk with the fans directly in the discord server and are very down to earth. So as for gameplay its all about paranoia and trying to figure out who you can trust while you do the objectives around the level. You can play different classes that focus on different perks to mix up the game which works out very well. Again im not very good at reviews but please give this game a try it needs the players!Also it has a discord group page for everyone wanting to find games in it!https://discord.gg/9GG8tTQ

While this kind of 'the thing' in multiplayer game form has certainly existed before, SurvHive's integration of tabletop style elements and continually shifting objectives keeps individual matches dynamic and engaging and forces human players to improvise rather than strictly hunkering down.More than anything the game just produces a lot of tremendously entertaining stories and moments, whether tricking human players into trusting you as an alien or turning them against their own comrades, or slinking about dark corners as a human while the powerful Alien Prime hunts you down, it can all be quite memorable. As an EA game, there's still a lot of rough edges, gameplay elements need refinement and there are just the two maps at present, but it's a promising start from a responsive team."

You are either a human or alien, the humans can pick a class that has a role to fufill, the engineer can build gear and fix things the aliens destroy, scietists can develop cures and buffs, the cultist can aid the survivors with their unique skills to spy on the alien hive mind (Chat, but only rarely) and the soldier is the fighter and defends the friendly survivors.My personal experiance was I helped a soldier create a stealth device, once he picked it up he stabbed me in the chest with tendrill out his chest forcing me into the hive and giving him an advantage over the others.This aspect of anyone can manipulate you can be very scary, it can be your strength, or your downfall.And there is a discord server so you can organise games, have some banter and even make suggestions to the devs themselves, whom are very active and friendly with their users.

You got simple tasks around the map to do, but problem is you dont dare turn your back on anyone, as beasts can disguise as humans. The ultimate goal for humans is to survive with one guy and send him away with a ship.The graphics could be better with some more love, especially hit animation and hit detection.The game isnt very terryfying, despite tagged as horror on steam, but it doesnt mather. You can compare it to zombie mods in the counterstrike games, but with a better twist.Pros:- Exciting concept, trust or be stabbed. Paranoia is a keyword.- Friendly community (so far to me)- Active devsCons:- Low playerbase, I'm a EU player and the game is dead on a Friday night ( 25 minutes past midnight, 06.08.2016).- Graphics could be better- UI/Hud could need some love aswell- No tutorial (How do you want players to stick to a new game & learn how to master it? tutorial helps alot. Had to figure out the keybinds for different stuff myself.- Few maps (only 2 as of 06.08.2016).I know this game is still in EA, so I recommend it, because it have a great fondation with active devs and a interesting concept , gameplaywise. If you're unsure of buying or not, check the playerbase before you buy."

,Recommended,499230,29116510,Posted: 8 January,all,Sir Ratman,"So. This game is very very fun. Its basically The Thing merged with Aliens merged with Garrys mod TTT. It has four different classes, Cultist, Scientist, Engineer, and Soldier, all with different abilities. For example, the Scientist can conduct experiments in the labratory and give the humans, or the aliens, speed or health buffs, and the Cultist can place down protective symbols to help protect the humans from the Aliens. Speaking of the aliens, one of the players will spawn as an alien in human form, and what you can do is middle mouse click to transform into your true form, or you can right click to infect humans with a huge chest spike. The aliens will try and infect all of the humans, and the humans will attempt to complete special objectives to stop the map exploding. If worst comes to worst there is a escape shuttle in the hanger which one human can escape in. Keep in mind you have unlimited respawns, but if you kill a human with guns as an alien or a human you will be given a penalty to stop mass murders. The storys not so bad either, its basically the humans were drilling in the ground, found an alien artifact that grants unlimited respawns which the cultists worship, and a weird alien tree thing that infects humans.But, there are a few problems with the game. The main one is the playerbase. There isnt much of one, infact if you go onto the server list you will probably find all empty servers. The devs have worked around that though, they have made a discord area where you can find matches with other people, and the community is great fun to play with. There are a few glitches and bugs, but that is to be expedcted from an early access game, but its a very fun experience none the less.Would I reccomend this? Yes, yes I would but discord is a must. Without the discord, its nearly impossible to find a game. Go join it. The game is extremely fun, espiecally when your a lesser alien and climbing on the ceiling"

If you're interested in buying, there's a 2 or 4 pack on humble store that you can get for yourself and friends! The game itself is essentially the movie ""The Thing"". Human players are paranoid and must band together to survive the alien threat. The alien is disguised as one of the humans and it's a matter of finding out who it is. There are events that happen which cause humans to get out of their cozy fortifications and fix the issue. The alien attacks humans with the means to turn them into an alien as well. The game ends when either all humans have turned into aliens or a human has taken the last escape shuttle. Again, it's great fun and the community is small but growing. Can't recommend enough!Here's a Discord link too, where players and developers talk!https://discord.gg/6QK8zkv"
,Recommended,499230,29098949,Posted: 7 January,all,MattoFever,"This is a game which mixes ""The Thing"" with a TTT like aspect. It has quite a lot of potential, the devs talk to the players and the only thing stoppping it from having great reviews is the lack of players. This is caused because normally people like to play the game with 4 or 5 people minimum and, if a player hadn't joined the discord channel where we organise games, they would get fed up with waiting and get a refund, leave a bad review and move on when the game mechanics are quite interesting and it runs quite smoothly as it's quite optimised. Of course there are improvements that can be made, but how many developers talk to their player base and take their suggestions into consideration? This game could turn out to be quite good, but without people joining the discord channel, the player base is being crippled. You can stop this when you buy the game by simply joining this discord channel. Since people are not buying the game, the developers cannot just rely on the money from this game to live on and so development on this game slows down.tl:dr A good game, lots of potential, good direction, lack of sales due to bad reviews from players who don't join the discord channel, slower development but great communication from said developers."

Please dont let them see me, I dont think they ever noticed me grabbing the cloaking device at the beginning of the round...I jump into the escape pod, fire up the engines and blast out.I MADE IT!for now...Please support this game, it is really REALLY fun, and needs a strong community.  I love the event system and hope it gets even more fleshed out.  It fixes the problem a lot of these games have - too much hide and seek with nothing to do.The classes and xp / perk system are really well thought out.The graphics need some polish, but the interface is surprisingly nice for EA.Seriously, this is one of those games where if a few famous youtubers played it, it would be HUGE.  Sadly, it hasn't recieved that attention yet.Give this game a shot, I'm glad I spent 15$ on it (and now another 45$ for a 4 pack on humble store).

Bear in mind the date of this review before making your opinion.Okay so, I'm a HUGE fan of ""The Thing"" and I think the idea of aliens slowly taking over the crew and you don't know who to trust is awesome, hence why I love Trouble in Terrorist Town. So, I purchased this game based on my love for ""The Thing"" and ""Aliens"" among other inspirations, and as well the ~90% positive review on steam. I read through some of the other reviews and many praise the game for its potential, not what is in the game currently. Imo this is NOT a review of the game as a review is an analysis of the game in its current state, not what it could become. I have also read the dev is responsive and active on fixing bugs, addressing people, etc, which is rare in an early access title. However, even though I agree that the game has potential, I am going to talk about what the game is currently.This game is a hot mess where pretty much everything is off. While I wouldn't expect an early access title to be perfectly polished, this feels like it is the .000001 Alpha build. The movement feels too quick, and your character doesn't really feel like he has any weightYou're not in the vaccum of space so don't pull that excuse. The UI is terrible, the text pop ups look rudimentary and your map system are just rotating squares that show through wallsgood luck reading that♥♥♥♥♥♥while it rotates and doesn't get larger when you're far awayThere is also a massive flaw in the design of this game, being that the gameREQUIREScertain characters or abilities in order complete these random events that pop up. The problem? Nobody plays the game, so if you get an event where you need a pilot, but none of the people in your game are pilots, you're ♥♥♥♥ed, next round. The system currently has no balance in the event system so if you play with less people, you still get just as many and you often can't complete them, basically this means you need to have a nearly full if not full server to properly complete them, which is nearly impossible given the average number of players most the time is 0. And if you get killed during the match, guess what, infinite respawns! This game design baffles my mind as it removes all tension from anything when you know you're just going to keep respawning until you either win or lose the round. A lot of the reviews on here also claim how ""intense"" the game is and the tension that it has. I seriously wonder if we're playing the same game because there is absolutely no tension considering the rounds last an average of 2 minutes, you have infinite respawns, and none of the models in the game look remotely scary and when you kill them they freak out and ragdoll around which is♥♥♥♥ing hilariousso tense. The game also claims to be a mix of RPG elements, calling this game an RPG is an insult to the genre. You have the ability to pick between 4 classes to start the game, but all of them play the exact same, there is no differentiation between them other than weaponry. The ""upgrades"" you get are laughable, you can get them all extremely quickly which completely removes any potential of different player builds.tl;dr Game is definitely not worth buying, even on sale. Frankly even free in its current state you'd be spending time which is too expensive for me. The game is buggy, unpolished, unpopulated, unscary, not tense, and most damning, not fun. I was even playing with a friend and our only reaction was wtfwe were in a server with ~5 people so we had a better than average experience. Just go play Trouble in Terrorist Town instead, at least until this game gets much far down the road in development."

76561198053656072,Recommended,499230,26332457,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,Warbeck,"I would recommend this game to anyone interested and have really enjoyed what it has to offer so far.There is more depth to it than originally appears, that said we've been fortunate enough to get eight friends to get it so we've had some really great games.+ Classes are good fun and prove different approaches+ Inclusion of items such as the radio helps identify aliens (although I don't think players should start with one) and add depth+ classes still useful as aliens- can research tech to improve aliens like the humans can+ Aliens can sabotage systems- this is huge and really adds to the tension! We particularly like that they can take out the lights+ varied objectives keep most matches fresh+ the two levels are fairly fun and different from each other although the Aurora has much more tension and tactical possibility.+ Fun with friends as long as you're all on mics.+ Aliens can crawl on walls and ceilings (as long as they aren't the prime)-Dying resets skills- it takes far too long as an engineer or scientist to do what you need, and one death resets all of this. Friendly fire counts too, very hard to make progress as an engineer or scientist.-Not enough of a penalty for killing humans as a human. I've seen others say they want less, but it's possible to kill a few players and carry on playing- Not enough tutorials or tooltips. After 6 hours we still don't understand the alien abilities!- Objectives are still not clear (but this is early access) and can result in player death until you've understood it all.- Not enough areas on maps where there are backdoors- too many places where humans can just camp an entrance and force the aliens to try to rush them.Despite the cons, I would suggest that as long as you can get a group of people together, this game is well worth the cost and as long as the Devs keep working on it, will continue to be excellent!"

76561198048359786,Recommended,499230,28501439,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,F3NR1R,"This game seems pretty creative and unique the way it is now, but as of now, I haven't been able to play a real match yet due to so few people playing the game. I'm giving it a thumbs up for the idea and the presentation for now, and my review will change once (if) I've been able to play a few rounds. From what I've seen from gameplay videos though, I think giving the alien side unlimited lives is kinda unfair if your gonna give the humans limited ammunition and resources. The aliens should have a set number of lives that ticks down every time one of them re-spawns, they should gain one to maybe three lives upon a human being infected. If the aliens lose all their lives, the humans win."

,Not Recommended,499230,30229392,Posted: 27 February,all,Husky Dick,"It's got a 15$ price tag. The game isn't even close to finished. I don't think it's worth it. I got it on sale, so then it was a fair price for what the game offers. Until it's way more completed and polished, I don't think I'm playing it much more. There's a Garry's Mod game mode that is almost equivalent to this. I will change my mind when I see further development."

At least the devs are on the right foot with the basics and mechanics of the game... Needs some work.(Actually a lot of work.)*Playing with someone would be much better.*The game is very confusing for a newcomer such as me.*The menu... Not there yet but it will hopefully join us sometime.*The mechanics are unique but perhaps it would be more intriguing to add some more skills,traits,abilities etc.*A lot of animations need to be finished.*Sound bugs? Or maybe bad sound quality? Or its just a problem with my audio card I don't really know.Yes,yes I know people who will read this throughly would think like;"" Why does this guy even recommend this game?""Well friend, this game is unique thats all. I played some decent amount of Natural Selection but this one is just completely different and when I saw that ""Inspired by The Thing"" I instantly bought the game without watching a trailer or anything. Suprisingly the game looks good. But as I said needs a lot of work.I would give it a 5.4/10. My review and score will definitely change in the future updates.Feel free to add and play with me."
