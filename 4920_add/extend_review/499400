I spend that on so many useless things that I never even use besides maybe once.Anyways to the review :)This game has quite a bit going for it. It's a rail style shooter in which you are placed in a mine cart of sorts and have to defend yourself against the robots that are coming at you. I died several times on normal mode so I can only imagine how challenging hard mode can be. This is something that I really enjoy in games in general not just vr games, a challenge.The developer has also added in an optional locomotion system that you can try out whether it be to work out some or just mess around with you can change your players movement from automatic where you are just riding in the cart to being moved by jogging in place. This does a couple things.Give you a pretty decent workout if you play for prolonged periods of time - CheckMake the game more challenging if you find yourself too boss at the regular missions - CHEckMake you look like a fool  -   CHECK!!In all seriousness the shooting feels very solid in this game and for only $3 you can't go wrong!Definitely worth picking up.(Below is a link to a gameplay commentary I made of this game, so if you are curious of how the game plays then check it out!)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=723389977"

Although the game has a really good soundtrack (it was very nostalgic of a Final Fantasy 3 castle tune), it was too random and largely uninspiring to continue playing.The gun doesn't shoot particularly straight, and the enemies are very far away, which gives the game a very random feel as opposed to any sort of skill or improvement in shooting. Also, enemies shoot from far away and their bolts are very fast, making it almost impossible to dodge. The lack of feedback after being hit didn't give me much desire to even try to dodge, really, and I found myself 'wild-wild-west'ing most of the time on the same dreary path.While everyone seems to be heralding this for its super cheap price, I would argue that there are MUCH better shooters out there for the same or less (or free) right now on the vive. It was a good attempt, but this one just didn't do it for me."

,Recommended,499400,24281726,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,Rafport,"It's so much better than I thought, an endless runner ( with running in place that works perfectly!) combined with a shooter. Nice graphics too. The price may suggest a humble product, but it's a solid game.EDIT: I'm going for the 2 hrs of playing, and likes the game even more. The jog mode is great, you can cover yourself before enter in a stage, and hit far robots. With the experimental time blade, you've a sort of bullet time to deflect shots. It's also the best workout I ever had with the Vive, better than Holoball, Holopoint, BattleDome... whatever, here you actually run all the time with some pause for shots and hide, it reminds me the jogging in Wii Fit but even better! I hope this will grow as soon as new contents will be added."

The barrel felt a little raised up to me on default. Also allows in game Super Sampling. As far as the game play goes, it is pretty difficult. I have been able to block a few incoming enemy shots with the Sword but it wasn't very easy at all. Graphics are pretty damn good. Still a bit rough around the edges in areas but I can see this becoming a very polished game over time."

SPT is awesome on this front. This should be copied or the gun just made more accurate. Would like no gun loading option too, personally.Enemies need more AI.Enemies should be bigger too, in a VR headset it is hard to see them.Shield perhaps, instead of a pretty useless sword?A story would be great, maybe more changes to the levels.The train track works well, and the idea is cool, and its fun to play.I think most people will be happy with the fun for the money but leave the game wanting so much more.I do recommend it for this price."

Jogging in place could help you exercise but it's not fun when you're on a rail and it's slow as♥♥♥♥♥♥Enemies appear so far away you can count the pixels that make them up. Your weapon has spread, so those far away enemies take 2 or 3 shots apiece because you inevitably miss even though your aim was dead on. It makes me question the value of such a mechanic in VR but fine, spread is an old mechanic from many generations of FPSes. Kicker is, every shot they fire hits you. Not fun.Maybe if it had a shield for the other hand instead of a pretty useless machette, and there was some time to block the shots, it could be fun. But as it is now, it just feels like someone's grad school game design project.No thought went into what makes games fun. It's just a set of conditions that are gamey.Not worth the money."

Man im glad im rich and im not worried about $3 because this game is really fun. you can either ride in a mine cart or jog in place to move while trying to shoot robots and deflect their shots all the while shooting crystals I ave a gtx 1080sc so i have my steam ss set to 1.3 and in game where you actually have the option of increasing it as well i have it set at 2.0 and man this game actually looks nice and with the increases i can see all the far off robots very well. the gunplay is tricky but actually pretty good, in some ways i feel like mc cree from overwatch with my six shooter. overall i would recommend its a fun way to spend your time."

And it's great to see the dev making improvements, it's clearly a labour of love from the developer.It's not perfect, it's a difficult game, partly due to some of the very distant robots which are hard to see. But seriously it's a well produced title, at under £3 it's a must have to add to your VR library."

There doesn't appear to be any way to dodge or block enemy bullets so every game only lasts the few seconds it takes for your shields to run out. The game either needs to add some way to survive more than a few seconds or add an explanation of whatever game mechanic I'm missing that permits survival."

That was literally my only complaint. So, now for a review... The game is a simple on rails shooter, but with the jogging aspect to move you forward, it's fun and exercise. It's challenging to hit things while still jogging, so you could set goals for speed runs. and it's a great price."

,Recommended,499400,25464739,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Game Cooker US Rocks VR,"The only reason I would recommend this is because of the price. Other than that it is kind of stale in my opinion. Models and look of levels are too repetative for me. There were some large monsters thrown in there that you kind of have to keep at bay while shooting other things to prevent death. If you love rail/wave shooters than I guess you will like this. It is a good thing to show friends if they never tried VR but for us veterans or at least me. Nada real great game at all. The one thing that saves it besides the price is the fact that you can run in place (if you choose) to move forward which is a fresh new thing in VR. You can get a workout and have some frag fun. Make sure your headset is on tight as it will bobble up and down as you run and keep your chaperone on as you do tend to move forward bit by bit even though you are jogging in place.Therefore, setting yourself back in center will be often. It is hard for me to hit recommend as it was kind of boring for me and I do not really like rail/wave shooters much. I will give a free pass though on this game as it is priced reasonably.The video below will be viewable after YouTube processes it. You may or may not be able to hear me talk because of the music not being able to be adjusted and or me removing the sound for other reasons. Thanks and enjoy.https://youtu.be/RD9jqw5q2Ic"

The game has 2 locomotions, 1= on rails and moving forward constantly and 2= jogging mode which i preferred. In this mode you move along as you have a little jog, or in my case, just bobbed my knees up and down abit. The gun mechanics were pretty good i thought although there is always room for improvement. You get a sword and a gun,i only used the sword a couple of times as i could shoot most stuff. There are missions and an endless mode. Anyone thinking of purchasing this game, go ahead, its cheap and i have seen much worse for a far higher price"

There are a few things wrong with it, and the dev admits that with the price. But as the first release of the game it's very polished for EA.
