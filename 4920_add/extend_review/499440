There aren't any instructions, but the mechanics are easy to figure out, and the puzzles are quite small and not hard to solve, either. A lot of the mechanics involve sliding and tapping, which means the game is well suited to touch surfaces.But it definitely isn't difficult. It uses the 3 dimensions well, but all of the puzzles are rather small, and all of the different mechanics (swapping, rotating, sliding) are never explored to a depth where they would pose anything like a conundrum. I foundHookmore challenging, and even that wasn't difficult.If you're looking for a short casual puzzler, this game and its price would be ok.This game runs well on my old Windows XP computer, but I needed to hold the shift key while starting the game to get a settings dialog where I resized it."

What delighted me most was the way in which the various individual simpler puzzles were eventually composed into more complicated multi-mechanism levels.

Only late in the game the puzzles get interesting force you too focus.I've beaten it in 1,5h - which is really short (c'mon LYNE is a similar game and I've put 200+h in it).

A few made me think a bit, but nothing I would call difficult or challenging (for a child many would be). Definitely worth the cheap cost (come on, it's literally one dollar). The colors were very bright, though, so a dark/night skin or a choice of themes would be nice. Achievements would be cool as well, and a menu with level selector would also be handy so you don't have to scroll back/forth one by one.

76561198276020441,Not Recommended,499440,29090735,Posted: 7 January,all,iamnotalungfish,"Aestethically pleasant and visually interesting, but ultimately uninspired -- less a puzzle game than the spacial reasoning portion of an IQ test given a graphics upgrade. The difficulty curve of klocki remains far too long at ""insultingly easy"" and barely passes into ""mildly puzzling"" at its peak. What challenge it does pose derives less from clever mechanics and intellectually stimulating puzzles and more from sometimes unclear rules and odd ambiguities caused by the game's own, admittedly nice, aethetic getting in the way. Klocki's worst sin is that it is dull in a pretty, inoffensive way, but surely one can do better than dull but inoffensive? Take a shower. Eat some oatmeal. Look out the window for a while -- or perhaps regard a painting or particularly facinating patch of paint on the wall. The world is your oyster."

This time you are matching lines on puzzle pieces to create a path by replacing one with another, sliding them or rotating them and in later levels sometimes all at once.  To add complexity you can even rotate entire sides or even just parts of the sides.  While the game never gets too complex, there is a level of difficulty in the last few puzzles that requires a bit of thought and planning.The soundtrack is very soothing and the graphics great reminiscent of Zenge, not by this author, but without the overarching story.I have no idea how many levels there were (50?, 60?), keeping with the minimalist theme there is no counter or selection scene, could have used one.  The game ended when it wrapped around to the first level again.  The game only took me about an hour, but for the very minimalist amount of less than one dollar, Klocki is a great little game worthy of your time."

,Recommended,499440,25301258,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,Stefneh,"I really enjoy unique little puzzle games and this one is a nice addition to the library. It’s quite short, as it took me just over an hour to complete, but it was still quite enjoyable in my opinion.It plays with various mechanics to mix the game up a little and make it a little more challenging. It also does a good job of introducing each new mechanic gently before incorporating it into all the others and giving you harder puzzles to solve.Difficulty wise, I would say that it’s not at the “mind-boggling” level, so you won’t have to think too hard about it. But with that said it’s not too easy either. It’s kind of a middle ground that I would say still left me satisfied enough to have liked the game.The graphics are simple and nice on the eyes, which gives the game a chill kind of feeling despite the fact that some puzzles towards the end look a little visually chaotic.This game came after the developer’s previous puzzle game “Hook” which is another unique short little puzzle game that I quite enjoyed. If you have played and enjoyed that I think you would enjoy this one too, and vice versa to people that have played this and might enjoy that.I look forward to any other little puzzle games that this developer comes out with and would say it’s definitely worth spending an hour on for under £1.EDIT: The dev added in an achievement after I had finished it for completing the game, I re-installed the game ready to go through it again and was pleasantly surprised to know that despite it saying that it’s not on the cloud, it had saved that I had already completed it. As you can scroll left and right through the levels and it was where I left it last time, I automatically got the achievement. So an easy 100% if you haven’t played the game, but an even easier 100% if you have.TL;DR : It’s an interesting and unique little puzzle game that is quite short but enjoyable over all."

,Recommended,499440,24390250,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,Vertex138,"What is it?Klocki is a simplistic puzzle game that requires you to connect the paths of wires(?) in order to complete each level. Although the first levels are rather simple, things start to make you scratch your head and think about 40 levels in. In total, there are082levels, each one slightly more challenging than the last. If you enjoyLyne,Hexcells, and/orHook(a puzzle game previously created by the same developer! :D), then I'd recommend you give this a shot as well.The Pros* Its simple game play makes Klocki a game that anyone can pick up and play.* The difficulty of the later puzzles was pleasantly challenging without being hard enough to make someone want to quit.* Even without any written instructions, Klocki communicates what the player must do only through its level design. This is something I have seen many games try (and fail), and Klocki does it best.* The graphics and sound, although they may not be complex, combine to create a pleasantly minimalistic work of art.* I got just over an hour of playtime. Although that doesn't sound like much, that's not bad for a game of this price.The Cons* There is no level select menu. If you want to go back (or forward) to an earlier played level, you must click arrows on the bottom corners of the screen.* The game, although slowly gradually introducing you to new concepts, doesn't feel like a challenge until about half the game. Those familiar with puzzle games may be disappointed in the beginning.* An disappointing ending. The last level also felt very unsatisfying to complete, being easier than the previous levels you were just completing. After clearing all of the levels,you are simply brought back to the first level. I ended up completing the first two or three levels again thinking ""Why are these so easy?"".Alas, it is only a puzzle game, I'm not sure what I'm expecting for an ending.* With all of the aforementioned cons in mind, this only feels like a beta release of the Klocki. I hope an update is released for this game, even if it only adds a few more levels or a level select screen.Other notable points* As I predicted, some trading cards were added a few days ago (May 2Xth, 2017)! A single achivement was also added at some point for when you've completed the game.* There is no score. There is no timer. There is no text. Basically, there is nothing to measure your ability to play the game. It's all up for you to decide.The VerdictI recommend you give the game a shot! Although I seem to have written a hefty list of cons, do not let that deter you; they're heavily outweighed by the pros. And, even if the game is fairly short, its price is unbeatable, and you're supporting an awesome indie developer!Edited on May 28th, 2017-They added trading cards and a single achivement. Neato."

Released on the PC platform on Jul 13, 2016 and is also available on Iphone,Ipad. There are no user reviews yet as of this writing.(http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/klocki).On steam page, it shows klocki was developed by Maciej Targoni and Wojciech Wasiak. The same people who brought us Hook. klocki is also available on Linux.To say klocki is just ""a puzzle game"" - it is a unjust description on this product.For me, I would describe klocki as creative, innotive puzzle game. Because it introduces mechanics/multiple combination of methods to solve a puzzle. This is what makes klocki interesting & fresh. It stand's out from the rest of the other puzzle genre games.Controls, Audio and VisualsIt only uses Mouse control. No video/sound options. There's feedback sound on every block/click you make. The background music is light and relaxing - something very soothing.Visually, its bright & colorful.Game Mechanicsklocki uses mix n match, rotating, reversi-like, number slide-like elementals to solve it range of puzzles. The difficulty gradually rises. So it does *not* shock the audience of the product. There's a little surprise at the last level puzzle. It shows this  is a labor of love.My personal thoughts:I don't really  play a lot of puzzle games because of my horrible past experience with them. The excruciating pain & frustration you put your mind through. The time and effort ..It feels as if my brain wouldBURSTif I continue further.Luckily, klocki does not put you through that sort of horrible gaming experience. There were some very tricky-crazy puzzles but it's still manageable. Overall, I was impressed with this simple, polished product. Good work with klocki, devs. Kudos. Keep up the good work.I do have 2 points to share, hopefully the developers will take them into consideration for their future products.I would love to see a simple level design because there might be younger audience or people who are stuck in a particular level and unable to advance. It's a painful experience for them and at least with this design, they are given the option to skip a level and come back in the future to complete that particular level. This also serves as a replay-ability option and people would have an easier time making videos, showcasing klocki on youtube,etc.I understand this request comes with revamping the whole level progression and unlocking achievement triggers. If you are unable to make all the changes for klocki, do it for future products. =)Video option: I would certainly love to play this in a window mode. It doesn't have to be full screen all the time.My Summary:klocki was surprisingly relaxing and enjoyable - for me. That's not usually the case when I am playing puzzle genre games. lol. Creative mechanics, soothing audio, clean bright visual designs, I couldn't ask for anything more. It also has a fair pricing for this small scale of product. It's really worth it. I am pretty sure kloki has enough challenge for everyone; kids, teens & adults. On the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for klocki is a solid 8/10.#Edit1: Had to to replace a word - else the sentence would be misinterpreted."

Some puzzles involve swapping tiles, some involve rotating tiles, some involve sliding tiles around on the grid, some even involve rotating whole segments of the puzzle landscape. The shape objectives vary as well. Some puzzles are about creating a continuous line, others about filled shapes, and others about keeping matching tiles from touching.I didn't want to call this a ""short"" game, since my speedy completion could be chalked up to my being so enthralled with the game, but puzzle lovers will probably only need about a half hour (which is truly not bad for the asking price). I assume I completed all the available puzzles, because eventually my progress looped around to the beginning again.The ""minimalist"" tag is no joke. The graphics are clean and simple (although some of the colors could stand to be tweaked). In lieu of a tutorial, the game (thankfully) presents you with extremely tiny puzzles to force you to experience the new mechanics through doing, not reading. The interface is minimalistic to a fault. There is apparently no menu. If the game is running, it is displaying a puzzle. You can mute/unmute and you can skip forward/backward through puzzles you've already beaten. There is no table of contents, no volume adjustment (I was hoping to lower SFX and raise music), and no ""exit"" button.I really hope that additional puzzles will be available a some point in the future, even as paid DLC.

It does something that I think is indescribably unique and valuable for a puzzle game -- it switches things up. Often, when the difficulty of a puzzle game like this one increases, you get increasingly difficult puzzles of the same type over and over again. It gets to the point where the puzzle is so complex and you don't even feel like solving it because it just seems like busy work.THIS GAME DOES NOT DO THAT! What a pleasure it is to put in a solid 10 minutes to solve a puzzle, and then be rewarded with something totally new to learn instead of just a more annoying version of the thing you just completed. Don't get me wrong, you WILL get more difficult versions of the same puzzle, but not for more than a few puzzles in a row. I think a lot of games could learn from this.

Different tiles can be manipulated in different ways, with more complicated levels requiring tiles of different types to be interlinked across orthogonal planes. The gameplay of some later levels can feel a little noisy, but I rather enjoyed the process of navigating a convoluted process in search of a visually simple solution.Klocki's fundamental appeal is aesthetic; notable touches such as the lack of in game instruction, written interfaces or move counters help to create an isolated but pleasant world in which experimentation is rewarded and mistakes are without consequence."

,Not Recommended,499440,25045486,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,33550336,"I'll be honest here - I bought this game expecting that I wouldn't enjoy it. And well, here we are. I understand that nobody likes a party pooper who buys overwhelmingly positive rated games just to leave a negative review on them, but I have a few important points to make.Before anyone starts to think otherwise: In no way do I hate puzzle games. In fact, I would say puzzle games are my favorite genre. The feeling of satisfaction when one solves a difficult puzzle, the 'aha!' moment, is one of the best experiences one can have playing video games. But, for me at least, klocki fails to deliver on this experience.The goal of each level in the game is to rearrange the pieces in it so that there are no ""loose ends"" remaining. It's a very simple concept and the game communicates it to the player without using any words, which is one thing I'll give it credit for. Unfortunately, the depth that this system is supposed to allow for is sorely lacking.When I say that, part of what I mean is that the puzzles are easy in this game. Quite easy, in fact. There weren't many puzzles that took me more than a couple of minutes to solve. Now, I don't demand that every puzzle game be Snakebird levels of hard (even if I prefer it that way), but there's no satisfaction to be had in solving an easy puzzle. Puzzles are supposed to challenge your mind in a way that makes you feel smart when you solve them. If there's no challenge, there's no smart feeling when you solve them. There are a few challenging puzzles in the game, but even those don't really give the game much depth.Most of the game's difficulty comes through complexity - you make the levels harder by making them larger. This is poor puzzle design. A puzzle game's difficulty should come from exploring the strategies that the ruleset allows for. But in this game, there really isn't much strategy in solving the puzzles at all. When you discount the possibilities that obviously won't lead to a valid solution, each puzzle can be solved through pure trial and error. If a particular piece has some loose ends, you move it around to a different place, and if that messes up the connections of a different piece, you adjust that piece also, and soon enough with this process you'll end up with the solution. The game frequently adds new methods of moving pieces such as rotating handles and sliding tiles, and also new types of connections such as abstract shapes, but these fail to change the basic strategy of trial and error. In the end, they feel like a cover-up for the inherent shallowness of the core game mechanic.So, if you're looking for a puzzle game that requires clever thinking and intimate knowledge of the game mechanics, you're probably convinced by now that this is not the puzzle game you're looking for. But I suspect that most people here don't really care about difficulty and depth of mechanics - they just want  something that can pass the time while also being simple and relaxing. That's perfectly fine; life can be exhausting at times, and you might not want to play super-demanding games after you've had a long day. But even considering that, this game is poor value for your money.Some people are going to look at me weird for calling a 99 cent game ""poor value"". But yes, this game is poor value for your money. It took me 45 minutes to complete this game, so that's 0.75 hours of gameplay per dollar. Which doesn't look too bad at first, but let's compare it against my favorite puzzle game, Stephen's Sausage Roll. (I'm sorry, I just can't help but be a zealot for that game. It's soooooo good.) Stephen's Sausage Roll is $30, and it took me 32.5 hours to beat, giving over an hour of gameplay per dollar. Just think about it: a game thirty times the price of this onebeatit in value! And Stephen's Sausage Roll's puzzles are much more involved, so you could even say that each hour is more ""densely packed"" than an hour of klocki. Even worse, you could play free online logic puzzle games such as nonograms or slitherlink, which I would consider to be around the same complexity as this game, giving a hours per dollar ratio of *gasp*infinity!.Now, I don't think hours per dollar is the best measure of a game's value, as the previous (ridiculous) example shows, but if you're playing games solely to pass the time, then most puzzle games are pretty much interchangeable for that purpose. And in any case, the ""good value"" angle seems to be what developers try for whenever they release an absurdly low priced game like this, so I wanted to get that out of the way. If you want to spend money on a relaxing logic puzzle game on Steam, I might suggest Everyday Genius: SquareLogic, which provides thousands of procedurally generated Sudoku-like puzzles that actually have quite a bit of depth to them. Or maybe you could try the Hexcells series, which has over 100 handcrafted Minesweeper-like puzzles over three games, plus a random puzzle generator in the third game. Both cost significantly more than the 99 cents klocki costs ($5 and $9 for the entire series, respectively), but hopefully this will reinforce a point that too often goes ignored in this era of cheap indie games and Steam sales: you get what you pay for.(I think I spent over three times as long writing this review than actually playing the game. What the heck is wrong with me?...)"

Finishing puzzles feels rewarding, even thought no rewards are given (if that makes sence).Also, the game can run smoothly on most PC's or laptops, given that it can run fine on my old PC w/ Windows XP and a potato for a graphics card.But, one flaw I must point out is the replayibility, or really, the lack of. After you finish the last puzzle, it sends you back to the first puzzle, which confused me for a bit. There was no ""Congratulations"", no credits, not even a ""GG"". So, after you finish all the puzzles, thats it. You're done.Also, IDK if they're adding more puzzles or not (I think they are, check the game description).Overall, a short puzzle game that took me just over 45 minutes to beat, but never the less, worth the tiny price of 0.99 (even better if you can get it on sale for a few cents).Edit: Since this review, they've added a good 20 or so levels to the game. :D"

,Recommended,499440,24374888,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,AppleLover,"Мне действительно нравятся игры от этого автора. Что Hook, что klocki - очень интересные игры. Стоят не дорого, меньше сотни рублей. на прохождения тратится не более 2 часов. Игры похожи, по моему мнению. Мне даже кажется, что идеи для klocki появлялись у создателя прямо во время создания Hook, и на ""часиках"" он оторвался по полной, создав игру не на одной определённой механике. Во время прохождения вы заметите много разных геймплейных фишек, которые потом будут умело сочетаться между собой на одних уровнях. Во время прохождения вы часто будете спрашивать сами себя ""Как?..."" в контексте со множистом вопросов, ""Он точно хочет сломать мне голову!"", подразумевая под словом ""он"" автора игры. Интересная особенность, что вам будет трудно оторваться от игры, а если вы это и сделаете, то только по причине усталости, так как мозги с каждым уровням кипят всё больше. В начале уровня вы будете топорно смотреть на монитор вашего компьютера, осознавать, на сколько сложен уровень, и думать, стоит ли вообще за него браться. пока вы будете смотреть, вы начнёте замечать особенности уровня, первые шаги к решению начнут приходить вам голову, и вы поспешите их реализовывать. Это вас затянет. Редко когда ваши решения будут неверными, поэтому рисковать всегда есть ризон. После осознания всех тонкостей прохождения уровня, вы приступите к полной его сборке. Эх, какой приток счастья и чувства выполненной работы хлынут на вас большим потоком, когда вы закончите уровень. После, вы захотите узнать, каким будет следующий уровень. ""Я просто посмотрю и выключу..."" - такая мысль будет промелькать нередко, но так ниразу  не сработает. При виде нового уровня, круг событий повторяется. Каждый уровень уникален и действительно манит, чтобы его скорее прошли так же благодаря тому, что упомянутые выше ""фишки игры"" умеле переплетаются как на уровне, так и между ними. Они чередуются, давая вашей голове отдохнуть от одной логики и подготовиться к другой. У вас вряд ли получится пройти Hook или klocki за один заход. Лично я делал один перерыв что там, что тут. Поздравляю вас, если вы прошли игру за один раз, но лично я люблю растягивать удовольствие, тем более, игра короткая. Этот факт не должен отталкивать вас. Этот 1 час игры однозначно стоит спрашиваемой с вас суммы. Я взял игру чуть ли не в первый день её выхода, так как следил за ней, поэтому получил скидку. Но, уверяю вас, преобрёл бы её и без всякой скидки. Ведь с вас требуют жалкие *здесь должна была быть цена игры* за такой шедевр! Что Hook, что clocki - игры перепроходимые. Проверено. Но даже если вы пройдёте иё и забудете, она стоит того, чтобы находиться в вашей библиотеке и иногда, когда вы будете на неё натыкаться, напоминать вам о тех славных минутах вашей жизни, когда вы ломали голову над новой загадкой, поставленной таким гениальным человеком, как разработчиком clocki. Так получилось, что я рассказал о двух играх, однако, дело в том, что игры действительно схожи."

I don't think its the best puzzle game out there, but it is a far cry from the worst.klockibrings several puzzle mechanisms to the table, which can at times make it feel like the B-Side outtakes of a larger, more successful, think tank project.The one thing I'll really fault it for is that it really doesn't take too much forethought or thinking ahead to solve the puzzles. You just play around with a loose plan in your head, and you will almost always get there.I value puzzle games that require no guessing, and reward (enforce, actually) a pure logic think-it-through approach (ie.Hexcells). While there are much worse offenders out there, this is probably where I'd sayklockiloses out from being really brilliant.Like many modern puzzlers,klockihas a minimalistic interface and design approach, which is nice. It is on mobile too.Honestly, I wouldn't pay full price for this - there is about 1.5 hours of content and it is bound to drop in price at some point - OR get it on mobile since it is probably better with touch controls anyway."

I have just started the game, but I feel I already want to review it for the one's who might be equally convinced by the positive reviews.I have played similar puzzle games before (LYNE, Hooks, Hexcells, and those I would recommend all). And yes, this game has nice relaxing music, but the colours are a lot stronger than they seemed in the video. And that was not really relaxing for me actually. The games I mentioned are doing a way better job in creating a relaxed atmosphere with music and visuals.Now the puzzles are also kind of boring, at least there are too many easy ones. You only need one or two to understand the rules of a new system, but not 5 or whatever. Some more difficult puzzles were interesting, but then the colours were too strong for my taste and I just wanted to get it done to get a change of colours.Maybe for a person who doesn't play other puzzle games and likes strong colours it might be interesting, but for other players who know this type of game, I would not recommend it."

The concept really shines, there is a feel of polish in the movements of the plates and new features are freaquently introduced to keep things interesting.In general it´s a unique idea that i´ve not seen so far with amazing gameplay innovations.The problem however is that it´s too easy and as a result of that, too short. Nearly all puzzles solve themselves, i personally only had to think on the second last one. And i was done after only 30 minutes.It´s sad as that one difficult level showed me what could have been possible with this, if the levels were better designed to not give a solution on 90% of all pieces (as they only have one spot they could possibly fit in), making the other 10% easy to match the resulted pattern.But still, i had a great time in this game, and so will you. If you´re looking for an amazing and innovative puzzle game, this will most likly blow your mind. But if you´re looking for something more open ended on the difficulty, you may be disappointed...EDIT:As people start to say that i didn´t recommend the game  even tho i did, i might have to clarify. Sure the games mechanics work great and feel amazing, BUT if you are not specificly looking for that, and that alone, i don´t recommend the game to you.It doesn´t matter how itricate and amazing the mechanics work if the game just gives you the solutions to nearly every level while being this short. If you look at SpaceChem, SquareLogic, Sokobond or Hexcells, the mechanics also are innovative and amazing. But they actually have a loooot more difficult levels in them so that you can spend a lot of time in them.If i play a puzzle game, i want to look at the screen and think of what i actually have to do. Simply rotating around some tiles until they fit a pattern for 30 minutes did not do it for me.Is the game well designed and its mechanics a blast? Sure. But that is not the only thing a puzzle game should have in my opinion..."

The music, the sound effects, the colors, the designs, everything in it seems to work together to put you in the best setting for an aesthetically satisfying past-time.This isn't a game for people who like hardcore puzzle action: it's short, it's easy, and there aren't any levels in which you'll find yourself stuck. That being said, I think it's much more of an experience than a puzzle game per se (for those who read ""puzzle"" and instantly think of brain-bugging, thought intensive, difficult games). I once rage quit on another game, so I opened up klocki and it was the best thing I could have done. It doesn't really present you challenges, but I took my sweet time with it (I played it for only a few minutes per day and it took me exactly 2 hours total to go once through all the levels) and oh, did I enjoy it.I also think the price is just fine, and would even argue it's cheap for everything you get, especially if there were more levels (which I find to be the only downside).

The game introduces many new types of puzzles as you go along, and intergrates them in such a way where the only work your mind can think of is 'wow'. When you complete a puzzle, it just comes together so nicely and it's so satisfying to see you have solved. If you've played The Witness, imagine this game as a smaller non RPG kinda game.

I think I ran through it in just under an hour without exerting myself too much. It was challenging enough to keep me entertained without being mindlessly irritating. (So no risk of launching my mouse through my PC's monitor, which is always a plus).The goal here is to move tiles around to make the required shapes, patterns and lines. This can be done by rotating, sliding or swapping tiles or multiples of tiles dependant on the puzzle. As of now (18th July) there aren't many levels to play through, but they do get increasingly difficult as you progress and there is a sense of achievement later in the game. There is no dialogue and there are no cut scenes, it's just an honest little puzzle game.TL; DR: When you look at how much you might pay for a AAA title and how many hours you might play it, then it becomes apparent that this really is good value for money.

At first it appears too simple and hackneyed, but I'm glad as I stayed with it, as it quickly introduced puzzle variations that kept it interesting and engaging till the end -- to the point I was disappointed it was over and went looking for more levels.The puzzle designs feel a bit amateurish -- in that there isn't a consistency to the difficulty ramp (it can jump from easy to hard to easy), and some of the innovative puzzle mechanisms aren't employed to their potential (e.g. the brilliant dominoes mechanism isn't used beyond a couple of puzzles). And I say that not as much as criticism, but rather as feedback to encourage the devs to focus there for future games, as they've done a remarkable job in most other aspects.It is a short game, but very appropriately priced for 99c.

The mechanics are well made, the soundtrack is good and the game teaches the mechanics in a simple and understandable way without telling you directly.The biggest problem with the game is the difficulty. The mechanics in the game are well made and with some time and effort harder levels could have been made. What i see in this game is wasted potential. I never really got stuck in the game and i would even pay more for the game if i would get some more challenging levels.And since i'm talking about difficulty let me explain why the game is easy. It's very predictable where some pieces should go or how they should be turned. This way it's easy to place tha mayority, if not all pieces. Then you are left with 1 to 6 pieces. And the moment this predictability was gone the game was near it's end.Also i have seen some very minor problems. Their influence on the quality is almost insignificant but the fixing them would be easy.The only way to find a level is by navigating trough them 1 by 1 using a pair of arrows. A small menu would be usefullAfter finishing the game you loop around, when this happened to me i thought the game was ending with some kind of alteration of the start. So i kept going for some levels thinking something was going to happenThe slide puzzles can only slide one at the time, which is annoying.An option for windowed mode. The game went on my second monitor(which has a pretty bad resolution). I used alt + enter to move it to the other screen but not everybody knows this.That said this game is only €0,99 which is a pretty good deal.for that reason i recommend it if you even have the slightest intrest in these kind of puzzles."

Just like Targoni's first game, Hook, it is relaxing, but also a bit challenging.I would highly recommend getting this game because you can get a substantial amount of time out of this game for the low price.Minor gripes would be that there is a lack of trading cards, achievements, and numbered levels - which Targoni's previous game featured, but perhaps they will be later added.Also Targoni listens to recommendations from reviewers; I have seen on Hook’s reviews that some people wanted a way to control the music on the game and Targoni has added a function to toggle the audio in Klocki.If you’re not completely sold on these positive reviews, Targoni has kindly provided a demo version!www.kongregate.com/games/targaciej/klockiI hope to see more puzzle games from Maciej Targoni, I will surely support this game developer further."

,Recommended,499440,25933284,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,Dark Blue Monkey,"What a pleasant little puzzler!The aim of the game is to complete lines or loops, where they can be wiggly across one surface, or wrap over corners to cover the faces of a cube.  It's all presented in isometric, with no need to rotate the whole play-space to get use of the three dimensions. It's really nicely done.   It doesn't use the isometric playfulness of ""Monument Valley"", for instance.  It just uses the flatter perspective to keep the game clean and puzzle-like.The puzzles start out really simple, and stay very simple for the first dozen levels.   Every so often a new play device is thrown in, but usually it's pretty obvious what to do with it... There's one thing ""the hourglasses"", which occur, and it can be a little bit of a headscratcher, but after a bit of experimenting, that turns out to be one of the funner devices in the game.I had a lovely time playing it on a plane, and then just in the evening once everyone had gone to bed to while away the last hour of the day. Each 'level' can take between 4 seconds and several minutes.  The sliding-block puzzles can take a couple of goes at them to get the right sequence, but none of them are particularly difficult.Very short, very easy, and very satisfying.    I can only imagine there'll be a Klocki 2 with far more interesting devices at some point, because this feels like a perfectly-formed well-made demonstration of the genre that's a wonderful game in itself.

However, the puzzle design is good, if not challenging - everything is fairly intuitive and well-presented - and the sound design is fitting, and as new mechanics were introduced an interested little ""ooh!"" escaped me a couple of times. I would like to see some sort of interface for level selection or way of telling how far through you are - hell, I'm a junkie for Steam achievements so a little positive feedback would be good for me - but I think that my latter preferences are at odds with what the game actually offers - an almost aimless wander through a few relaxing puzzles, instead of rushing through to hit targets or complete the game or whatever other things I do which stop me from switching off and smelling the roses.I'm not saying it will permanently change the way I play games, of course, but it is a nice experience.Also, it's hella cheap."

76561198249516004,Recommended,499440,32232906,Posted: 6 June,all,brockjahnke,"Usually with puzzle games, I find myself having a fun time, a soothing and/or challenging experience, for the first ten or twenty minutes before some actually difficult mechanics are introduced. Normally I'll try to brute force my way past this point or simply give up out of frustration. This game, klocki, resulted in the same experience, and while that mechanic introduced is one I have particular trouble with (slide puzzles), I stuck around because of what came before it. The first twenty-ish minutes of this game were a delight, very relaxing while remaining engaging, likewise surprising and impressing me with new mechanics and elements that were rewarding when overcome. So, looking for more of that, I kept trying and trying to get past the bits that stopped me, and after a good ten or twelve minutes, I was able to do so, learning from the experience, and the rest of the game flew by, not quite as hard as the initial roadblock but not quite as rewarding as the first stretch either.And that's what this game was, really. There's not a ton to write about. The graphics are fine for this sort of thing. The music is pretty good, reminding me a lot of A Winged Victory for the Sullen. Moving around various knobs and levers looks, sounds, and feels great. It's short enough that it doesn't feel daunting while also giving you a good chunk of game to get through (apparently I spent nearly two hours with this game, though it felt like quite a bit less). So what you're left with, after all that, is a game that is mentally and emotionally rewarding, which is what puzzle games should be. I'm no expert in the field, but I've played my fair share of puzzle games, and I can't remember one that delighted me quite like this one. Come to think of it, I cant think of one in a long while that I was able to beat before giving up out of frustration, which might be a big part of it. I was a bit let down by the final puzzle, though the ones that came before it sure were a challenge, so I suppose I should think of it more as a soothing epilogue than the final climax.In any case, this is a hell of a cheap game and it packs more of a punch than you'd think for that price. Buy it and put it on when you need to come down from a long day of work or just need a break from something. It's certainly worth that much."
,Recommended,499440,32233598,Posted: 6 June,all,MutantOctopus,"If klocki were priced much higher than it is, I'd have to give this a thumbs down. But the fact of the matter is, the game is very good for its price.klocki is a simple game: Make all the tiles activate by swapping, rotating, sliding, etc. Some tiles are 'wires' that need to be connected with no loose ends. Some tiles are black boxes that will turn into white circles when they're isolated from other tiles of their kind. Some tiles are circular and rotate on their axis; later levels will have you rotate entire chunks of the level to connect the lines.It's a short game, so don't expect to spent a whole day playing klocki. And it's not massively challenging, either. All the levels can be solved with a little critical thinking and a solid thought process. But for a dollar it's a pleasant little experience and more than worth the money if you like simple puzzles and have nothing else to use that spare buck on."

There are no time limits or move limits, it's just you exploring the minimalistic puzzles until everything works out.  It's a serene, calming experience, even as the puzzles become real brain teasers. There aren't a huge number of levels - it took me 90 minutes to complete the game, and I was doing other things at the time. But for a $1.00 game, it's a very nice casual experience."

The puzzle as they gradually increase in mechanics do so in a very intential and well thought out way.I highly recommend it as it is more fun the deeper it goes.
,Recommended,499440,32698173,Posted: 23 June,all,AtkinsSJ,"Short but sweet. Takes a while to get going... There are too many trivial puzzles early on and I almost thought it would stay that way, but after that, new game mechanics are thrown in and combined together in interesting ways. It actually reminds me a lot of Monument Valley, in a good way."
,Recommended,499440,33111786,Posted: 1 July,all,Nalgas D. Lemur,"The puzzles are more satisfying than challenging, although some of them get fairly interesting toward the end. Really it's the presentation of it that makes it what it is. Everything looks and sounds perfect, which makes it very relaxing to play and easy to focus on the puzzles themselves. The level complete chime is one of the best sounds I've heard in a long time, and the game is worth playing just to hear that every time you get something right. This absolutely fits right in in the bundle with stuff like Hook and Zenge, which are also great, minimalist puzzle games in the same vein."

For a quick little puzzle game, this one introduced some mechanics I have yet to see, and the color pallet was spot on.

The puzzles gently and naturally introduce a bunch of mechanics and then masterfully interweave them to create a relaxing game experience that bends the rules of geometry and requires some creative thinking. Others have said the game is too short, and I can't comment on that yet, since I have only played a half hour and have yet to beat it, but I'd say if you like puzzle games, this one is definitely worth the asking price."

,Recommended,499440,33666968,Posted: 20 July,all,3k0,"It's one of the shortest puzzle games I've ever played (1.2 hours, that's a personal best on Steam ^^) and it starts very boring – as it's designed for the casual mobile market. I was about to quit out of lack of challenge, when the black tiles saved the day. Later on, a few other mechanics spiced it more...Maybe a little bit too many mechanics, though, for a game that's supposedly so minimal. I wasn't fond of the sliding one (I must say I never liked sliding tile puzzles), could have done a few more fun levels and without this one mechanic.Overall, it's still a very good, and surprisingly enough, little puzzle game."

,Recommended,499440,33921806,Posted: 30 July,all,FlamingPhoenixFox,"Klocki is a short minimalist puzzle game where you move tiles around until every tile connects into its own shape(s). There are 82 puzzles in this game, and it took me about an hour and 15 minutes to complete it. There is only one achievment for the game and it's for finishing it. The ambient music is calming and not distracting. The puzzles were interesting, but not terribly difficult (there was only one that I got stuck on for any decent amount of time - the rest of them I could move around and sort of figured it out as I went).I think, overall, it was a decent puzzle game that is worth its price if you are just interested in a casual puzzle experience to keep your brain active. One thing I wish they had was some sort of level counter and/or a menu where it showed all the levels by number, because as it is now you don't know how much content is actually in the game until you finish it and even then if you wanted to know how many levels there actually were (like I did for this review) you would have to page all the way from the first puzzle to the last counting them yourself. Of course, this probably isn't a huge deal with those who just want to play a game and when it ends it ends, but for those wanting to know the quantity of puzzles they are paying for that little added bit would have polished the game up more."

There were some puzzles that confused me and got me fiddling with the puzzle, but once I figured it out, i felt a rush of relief and joy of overcoming it. The color schemes were pretty and easy on the eyes and the patterns that were formed were beautiful looking.They throw you straight into the game, no menu or settings other than going back to past puzzles and muting, but I think that is for the best as this is a minimalist game and a minimalist setting it best. However, there are some parts where a lack of words does confuse you for a few seconds.Overall, this game is a beautiful minimalist puzzle game and relaxing to play with. While there is no replay value, it is a puzzle game that you can play again. A game to relax to and not ruin your day."
