,Recommended,499460,24261106,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Sialoquent,"I bought this to be a light game, to play on my ultra book, but this game is poorly optimized, it can run well but the top of my lap begins to burn. On my tower, the game still has a low frame rate, and still has clunky, unresponsive controls.Pros:Nice styleLow power driveSolid platformerFez inspired gameplayThoughtful level designCons:Horrendous cameraUnresponsive controlsArtificially padding game time via starting the level with a back screen for a few secondsClunky gameplayLow resolution texturesOverall verdict, you should buy this game. I seemed harsh on this game, at the beginning of this review, because I really like this game and I want the developer to help fix these issues. I want him to grow and learn, from his past, and honestly I love this game and I want to see more platformers like this."

I couldnt get the game to start initially and had to do a restart, then it took all the way until level 3 to break the physics of the game and have to manually kill the program. The controls are clumsy too especially if you have the camera on auto.+1 for the hat but -2 for no Indianna Jones theme music: 3/10"

,Recommended,499460,24263600,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Kronk,"Really great concept and an enjoyable game to play. Besides the interesting control (which In my opinion is fitting for the game) the only real problem it has is the load times. The game has about a 5 second load every time you die because it reloads the whole level rather than just reverting you back to a checkpoint. If those loads are reduced, and the game optimized and tweaked a bit, this game will be fantastic!"

Still worth buying, even without the 2% discount!Original review: Tomato Jones is a simple platformer with a funny theme. It's amusing for what it's worth. Unfortuntely, it's also poorly optimized. While the game hasn't crashed yet, poor frame rates, long load times, and camera issues definitely bring the whole experience down. 7/10 Get it while it's 2% off!"

,Recommended,499460,29927124,Posted: 14 February,all,Pizzabot,"Pros:-Indiana Jones reference.Cons:-Broken physic engie-Noxious auto camera rotation(found out this can be turned off when I am in Level 18/20)>> Not recommend to play, but this game matches it's priceDetail tomatos:The physic in this game is very broken.In this game you control a tomato to move and jump around. And this game failed both of them.Moving is hard due to the slippery control, and this freaking tomato gain and loss momentum randomly.Jumping also got problem. In some puzzle, you will fail if you throw the balancing weight out of the map. But in fact you can still do the task thanks to the broken physic engine."
