They are in hindsight, but it seems each level throws you a curveball. You have to use a learned mechanic in a different way. The levels can be a little daunting and hard to absorb at first, but there's really nothing difficult here. Just learn the trick for that level. That's the rewarding part. At least twice I thought a level was impossible. They're not. Also, don't skip the optional puzzles protected by the forcefield. Those are the more difficult ones. I didn't care for the chromatic aberration. Luckily, it goes away with medium graphic settings and still looks amazing. Please make a sequel ASAP!"

It's supposed to be testing whiether you are a human or not and able to think outside the box as it were, except that the puzzles rarely involve genuine lateral thinking and actually just follow a predictable pattern with minimal variations for the most part.

I did need to look up a tutorial for a few levels, but that was only because I wasn't noticing something about the puzzle. Every time I was stumped was completely my fault, and not at all the game's.The voice acting is pretty good, especially with Tom, the ""antagonist"". I say this because he is clearly meant to be shown as the antagonist, but his motives are understandable and, to some, even agreeable. His choices are ethical or harmful depending on how you look at it and from who's point of view.The story, needless to say, is pretty decent, and compelling enough to keep you going through the 4-5 hour campaign.The graphics are very good, with pretty lighting and shiny textures. The animations are also decent enough, really the only complaint I have is the walking animations of the humans at the end, but that is a very, very minor complaint, and not at degrades my opinion of this game.Over all, this is a must play if you are a Portal or The Talos Principal fan that is looking for some puzzling to do."

If you take your time and explore more, you may find story additions, some obvious ones, and some hidden like easter eggs.Difficultywise the game is more on the easy side for experienced players. It stays slower paced, and can be leisurely solved.Graphicsare good and clean, and run properly optimized.

The first half of the game makes use of 2 basic mechanics, and only very close to the end you encounter puzzles that are somewhat challenging. The game is divided in 7 chapters, and even on the 7th chapter I could solve some puzzles in under 30 seconds.It feels like the game was supposed to be something else, but that didn't work, so they just threw together some puzzles and put the game on steam.If you're looking for a challenge, look elsewhere.If you're looking for simplistic puzzles to kill ~4h, this might be for you.Not worth full price either way."

76561198042069229,Recommended,499520,29284185,Posted: 15 January,all,ParanoidAndroid,"In The Turing Test, you take the role of Ava Turing, a scientist on Europa looking for her missing crew and led by the AI T.O.M. Playing The Turing Test immediately reminded me of Portal 2 in all the best ways. While The Turing Test does not reach the heights of Portal 2, and it would be unfair to expect it to, it’s an exceptional game in its own right.Like Portal 2, The Turing Test is set in a mysterious place and led along by an AI companion. While Turing Test plays things much more seriously than the lighthearted Wheatley, T.O.M is still an interesting companion to have and one could argue that it is the main character and not Ava. I won’t go much into the story as to avoid spoilers, but the game deals the with some interesting themes that sci fi fans may already be familiar with but the material doesn’t feel like a retread and is presenting in a thought-provoking manner.The puzzles in The Turing Test, while not the toughest, still gave me a great sense of accomplishment as I cleared each room. Gameplay revolves around manipulating orbs of energy and placing them in different sockets to solve puzzles. There are various orb types to help vary puzzles as well as a companion cube-like, well, cube. At the start of the game I found myself breezing through rooms but by the end there are definitely some that gave me pause. I found the gameplay to be a perfect blend of challenging, intuitive and novel.Technically, the game looks fantastic. I had all the settings maxed on my GTX 970 at 1440p and the game can look quite stunning at times. Some might find the JJ Abrams-level of lens flare annoying but I didn’t mind it. The game also ran flawless for me as well, never dipping below 60 FPS. The music is wonderfully morose mix of strings and horns that fit the tone perfectly. It was reminiscent of Radiohead to me and perfectly low-key.The Turing Test is an easy recommendation for any puzzle and/or sci fi fans. The story and gameplay are both engaging and it doesn’t overstay its welcome at about 6 hours long. Add this to the list of essential first person puzzlers, it’s fantastic."

If you haven't, you should play them instead of The Turing Test.Since it is a completely linear puzzle game, there are only really three elements which matter:- The puzzles- The story- The environment/atmosphereThe puzzles are mediocre. There are quite a few mechanics here, many more than you would need for a 4-5 hours game. The problem is that they never amount to a challenge. Passed the first 20 minutes trying to figure the basics, you will never encounter a puzzle that will even pretend to resist you. In fact, quite often, you might even complete puzzles without using all the tools at your disposal, because you do not need them.The story is ok. You can basically guess where it is going 30 minutes in. There are ""shocking revelations"" throughout the game, but they don't really impact the story overall, instead acting as little nuggets of life to make the characters feel a bit more relatable. The moral/ethical dillema presented is never really explored. And yes, you get to choose your ending, but it's really just a ""press the button or don't"" deal.The atmosphere is ok. Nothing to write home about. Atmospheric music, servicable visuals, just enough lore to not put you to sleep, pretty good voice acting. You'll most likely forget about it and never come back to it.The Turing Test is not a bad game. It's just your average space meal. If you are starving, you will push it down your gob, and it will keep you satiated for a few hours. But if you're not on the verge of death, you have no reason to want to ingest the tasteless, joyless mixture."

Theres only a few tracks for the whole game, and they only played half of the time, which is kinda annoying but whatever. My biggest conplaint is that some small parts of story are hiden behind walls of text. If the game could add a extra hour or so to explain this stuff through some other means, that would be nice.

Also a bit easy. You just go through the motions. Sometimes you wonder ""it can't be that easy, can it, (EDIT: It is and it never gets harder. ) "". The optional puzzles are as easy as the rest. Though it is fun to circumvent the game it shows lack of thought IMO.Example: optional 5 is a reused puzzle from the chapter 4. all together chapter 5 is ridiculously easy. They just give you a new means to do the same puzzles.EDIT: ALL of chapter 5 is ♥♥♥♥ing reused training puzzles but they somehow made them more boring and even easier. this actually got me fairly mad.DON'T compare this to talos. That game was built upon player freedom and encourage you to brake the game as much as you could while having a great narrative albeit a questionable ending(s). The hard (all stars ) ending was really great though.The game is esthetically pleasing and the story is fairly intriguing and makes you think a bit.It is not the lovechild of Talos and Portal as some say but more of their slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin.

I bought it solely because it was called 'The Turing Test' and I love science.To find out it was a blend of The Talos Principle and Portal, with story bits as reward and an aside for puzzles and the science and AI voice following, was a treat since I like those two games very much. If you liked those two games you will like this. I'd recommend not spoiling much because the story is gold in this one.Some may call the story cliche, but I only see it as an homage to great works like 2001: A Space Oddyssey. The presentation of science in this one is amazing. It glorifies science while introducing it to you in an interesting and accurate way. Explores many topics in Math, Computer Science and Philosophy.The puzzles will be easy to some but if it were any harder that would ruin the already good pacing of the game. One of the problems I had with The Talos Principles is the aside story texts were so long to read that it was jarring and sometimes I forget where I'm going. The pacing in this game is excellent.Definitely one of my favorite games this year, but I'm not claiming it is one of the best games this year.

The developers have indicated that this is intentional. Given that I have partial hearing loss and have friends who are deaf, this pretty much means we will never have the full experience of the game.

I frequently ended rooms with leftover pieces, and in two cases I didn't even need to explore the entire chamber. The optional puzzle chambers are a much-needed challenge but there are far too few of them.(I would love to see what sort of devilishly tricky chambers players could make if The Turing Test had a level designer like Portal's)THE STORY:The Turing Test touches on a couple thought-provoking concepts regarding consciousness and morality, but again it doesn't delve deeply enough to be satisfying. Observant players will figure out what's going on long before the protagonist Ava does.IN CLOSING:While not a bad game per se, I spent most of my time in The Turing Test being reminded of other, better games.If you want some truly mind-bending puzzles, I recommend trying The Talos Principle or The Witness.If you want you mind blown with a sci-fi story, I recommend SOMA."

It has the aesthetics of Portal and the puzzle solving similarities of The Talos Principal. You are awakened from cryosleep by an A.I. named TOM and tasked with getting in contact with the remaining crew, who have gone completely off the radar.  In your journey through the base, you are provdied with an energy tool, and are put through a series of Turing Tests (puzzles only a human could solve) that require you to shoot energy balls or place energy cubes into slots that power doors, lifts, and giant magnets amongst other things in order to ultimately power the door into the next room.  There are 7 sectors with 10 rooms each. At the end of each sector is esentially a 'plot room' that advances the plot via audio logs, notes, or simply the natural surroundings. Each sector also has one optional 'harder' room that when solved provides deeper clues to the backstory of why the crew went missing, and what, if anything, TOM has to do with it.The puzzles do not get overly difficult until the last sector. In a few cases there may be more than one way to solve a puzzle, as it seems like the puzzle designers went out of their way to make absolutely sure you do not get stuck in a room at any point.  This does not necessarily make the puzzles easier, but can potentially change your route.There are 15 achievements that without spoilers you will need to backtrack through the first two chapters to 100%. This is not a problem because as soon as you complete a chapter, you are able to play through it at any time.It is a very fun, well made, beautiful game, and I highly recommend it."

Also, some transhumanism from the Human TV series.Now, though, you have to buy this game for its adventure, not for its puzzles. The tests are meant to illustrate the story by providing an ironic and poetical minimalist immersion. (What with the almost seamless analogies between TOM's lines and the last test chambers of Chapter 5... The tests were key on pertinence, but the puzzle mechanics are not meant to challenge. Once that's clear, there should be much less disappointment.The Turing Test is a jewel.Its characters, narration and plot are superior to those of the Portal games. Its philosophy makes more sense than the philosophy in the Talos Principle.Also, it's best played twice: once to discover and once to appreciate.Now, Regarding Ava...most of her lines make more sense and are more open minded and likeable than that of most other past human protagonists who've been put against machines in media ... at least in the first half of the game. But I'm not going to spoil.So, yeah, she's an engineer, she knows the music and she begins playing it fairy well.However...just like in The Talos Principle, (though much less often) sometimes I felt like pushing the protagonist aside and explaining things to T.O.M. myself. I guess that means the game felt very realist. SPOILER: For example, when we find out that TOM used to mix up being sentient and being similar to humans, through the secret test room. Or when he was so sure that without his control, human nature would make humans choose their safety over that of others. And there are so many questions I wanted to ask it/him, that it's not even funny.PS: I actually played about 5 hours so far."

This is very unlike Portal, where you can't complete the game if you can't accurately place portals while rapidly moving.The other key similarity to the Talos Principle is its examination of philosphical concepts -- in particular, this game examines some of the same concepts that Talos Principle does but from the flip-side:  Given that humanity still exists, what does an AI have to do to prove that it is ""human"" (= worthy of the rights and privilages extended to humans) vs. a useful tool?  Talos Principle largely dodged this issue (no details to avoid spoilers for Talos Principle) so this covers new ground -- but largely in the same way.Very good puzzle game -- recommended for anyone who likes this sort of things."

I've never had motion sickness in my life, but I experimented it while playing this game.It's a good game. Not great, not exceptional, but good. Whoever says this game's puzzles are easy is LYING. I went through Portal with never consulting YouTube, but I just had to one or two times in this game. Although most puzzles are quite simple, there are some very challenging ones, specially at Chapter 7. The puzzles are the nicest thing in this game. And it also ends at the right time, because I was getting a little tired of them after 7 chapters. I recommend doing the optionalsThe story is pretty straightfoward and it has 2 endings. It's not an exceptional story neither, but it's ok. The ending is kind of disappointing, you make your choice for the ending, and that's it, after that there's a screen with ""The End"". The characters are a bit unappealing, but it's nice hearing the audio logs (they don't have subtitles, which is a shame). The dubbers on the Audio Logs were not very good, specially Daniel. But Sarah was great.There are some cool dialogues with the AI, but I never felt a true development with it.If you want a nice puzzle game to entertain you a few hours, The Turing Test may be a good choice. Final score: 7/10Primeiro, deixe eu avisar: Esse game pode te dar ""motion sickness"". Eu nunca tive isso na minha vida, mas tive pela primeira vez jogando esse jogo.É um bom jogo. Não ótimo, não excepcional, mas bom. Quem diz que o jogo é fácil está MENTINDO. Eu virei Portal sem nunca consultar o YouTube, mas tive que consultar uma ou duas vezes nesse jogo. Embora a maioria dos puzzles seja simple, há alguns bem desafiadores, especialmente no Capítulo 7. Os puzzles são a melhor coisa do jogo. E também termina na hora certa, porque já estava começando a ficar cansativo depois de 7 capítulos. Recomendo fazer os opcionais.A história é bem linear e tem 2 finais. Não é uma história excepcional também, mas é ok. O final é meio desapontador, você faz sua escolha e acabou, vem a tela de ""Fim"". Os personagens não chamam muito a atenção, mas é legal ouvir os logs de áudio (não têm legendas, o que é uma pena). Os dubladores nos logs de áudio não são muito bons, especialmente o Daniel. Mas Sarah foi ótima.Há alguns diálogos legais com a Inteligência Artificial, mas nunca senti um verdadeiro desenvolvimento com ela.Se você quer um jogo legal de puzzle para te divertir por algumas horas, The Turing Test pode ser uma boa escolha.

Filled with elements that don’t actually make sense and subjects that feel dropped in just for the sake of it.Doesn’t have the atmosphere or tension of Moon or Alien. The graphics and art direction here are fairly bland. Pacing is tiresome, too much gameplay with too little downtime.Characters in Portal were witty and likeable, here they are are pretty annoying, especially the MC who constantly acts like a child that can't comprehend anything. (Reminds me of SOMA. I don’t know why devs insist on having moronic main characters, its like they're trying to insult their audience. Films don't have them and they'd debatably be targeting a wider audience even. *Thinks back to Interstellar* Wait no they do I take that back.) Although the AI character in this game is OK, not quite 2001 A Space Odyssey level of death.As for technical stuff, I think the options menu could use some work. There were no separate y-asis invert controls for mouse and controller which was a bit of an inconvenience for me since I like to switch often. Also there’s no Linux or Mac support, Booo.

The premise is OK, and there are interesting bits of dialogue discussing the Turing Test and the Chinese room. This is where the story shines (imo) but the story ultimately falls flat because it fails to capitalize or expand on the premise. Whereas in the Talos Principle (Talos Principle spoiler)your choice at the end to ascend and to ignore the rules of the system is proof that you are the iteration ready to be awoken into the real world whereas, if you decide to follow orders, the game basically resets.There is no such nuance in this game which is a real shame because the story could have been something special.The gameplay:It's a puzzle game, much in the vein of Portal and the Talos Principle. The only problem is that the puzzles aren't as clever. Well, they might've been cleverly designed, but they are never a challenge to complete because ultimately the tools they use in the world are not particularly good vehicles for puzzles. There is never really a question of what needs to be done, and the lack of tools makes every puzzle very straightforward. The positive side to this is that you aren't pulling your hair out, and you don't have to resort to pulling out a scratch pad and jotting notes or making diagrams. But the gameplay is a bit shallow compared to other puzzle games.Overall:The game has polish.

TOM is the AI who needs Ava to solve the puzzles using the Energy Manipulation Tool (EMT), a gun that holds various types of energy charges, that are used to power doors, lifts, magnets, platforms etc To help progress you through the story and discover the cause behind the disappearance of the ground crew stationed there.The game pays great homage to Portal, and is similar to others like QUBE and The Talos Principal (Other great games BTW!) There is a great script and whilst Ava's lines seemed Mediocre and unconvincing, Tom really steals the show, with a nice passive voice (I swore it was Jeremy Irons lol), thats makes you believe hes the wise, senior type. Giving a great story throughout the game, thats very much the mystery scifi experience without Portals comedy element.Length wise there are 7 chapters with 10 levels and bonus levels earning you achievements for their completion (Sector 6's will drive you nuts!) with Audio logs, and tablets, letters lying around to cover more story.Visually its stunning, using Nvidias DSR with Ultra settings and getting 60FPS (Well it is first person!) With an ambient score, and scifi sound effects to boot.One problem I found was the loading times, but this is a good thing as it loads the entire chapter it would seem, as opposed to Portals one level, get in the lift (Hate that thing) which may prove slower on some older systems, but that was my only gripe with the game.One of the few games ive preordered and whilst ive put in around 8 hours, it could have been completed in shorter time, giving it decent value for money, but we will see what the DLC holds!"

Dialogue between Ava and Tom was not always believable for me, but that may be a result of limitations imposed by the premise of the story. Graphics, sound and overall design was quite welcome as I enjoy first person puzzle games.One note, I was playing with audio coming from my speakers, and for whatever reason the audio logs didn't play for me. I assumed this was some sort of cryptic aspect of the game. Turns out it was just a bug and when I plugged my headphones in, they played fine. Unfortunately, I was already halfway through and a lot of the story was dispensed through the logs. So I missed out."

This came into my radar as suggested by a friend and picked it up.This will be spoiler free entirely.Visually the game is spot on and runs smoothly which looks glorious.The Soundtrack is amazing, I'd certainly suggest picking up the soundtrack as an addition to the game. The soundtrack usage is quite sparingly, you'll be in the middle of one of the puzzle rooms and the music will begin to play. By doing so you'll not be overwhelmed by it and appreciate it when it does play.The story is really interesting and it's full of intrigue as to what went on at this location with the crew. With this being a Puzzle game the story can obviously lose steam and pull when you are stuck in a room for 45 minutes. With that said between each room dialogue and interaction brings you back up to speed.The Puzzles themselves are extremely clever, it tends to annoy me when a puzzle can be ham fisted to completion. I think there was a few times I finished the puzzle and I wasn't quite sure 'why' what I did worked. It does feel great completing the puzzles as some of them are rather difficult. The mechanics of the puzzles help them feel unique and no puzzle feels like an exact clone of another.If you are interested you can watch the first part of my playthrough to get an idea if it's for you or not.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_2mzLjbqlIWith that said, it's a solid puzzle game with a cool plot.

Compared to a game like Portal 2, I think the puzzles are slightly easier. The game does a good job of showing off what mechanics can do before throwing more difficult puzzles at the player using those mechanics.I think the story is somewhat mundane, using some common AI related topics, and the story did not capture my attention as much as a game such as the Talos Principle did. It positively surprised me how well the game uses mechanics and puzzle solutions to showcase or imply parts of the story. There is also something halfway through the game that conveys a surprisingly clear message even though it isn't spoken aloud.The game takes about 5.5 hours to beat. If you are a completionist, and take your time exploring the non-puzzle areas, you may end up at 6.5 hours. Optional 1 in chapter 1.7 is designed to not be beatable until you get mostly through the game. After finishing the game you can go back to this chapter to complete the optional room, getting you your last achievement. I don't think the game has any replayability after that.I found that the game has some weird loading issue, where the chapter would stop loading and the game would just sit on a loading screen forever. My solution was to set all settings to low and turn on stream loading before continueing the story. Then I could set the texture quality to ""high"" without a problem."

Gradually throughout the game, tough philosophical questions and increasingly complex puzzle mechanics are introduced. The game itself feels incomplete, with many mechanics unexplored and questions unanswered. In each of the optional puzzles, there are unique game mechanics that appear nowhere else in the game. Just as well, each of these restricted areas introduces more lore, background, and simply raises questions that aren't examined elsewhere. The game is hindered by the fairly uniform and predictable progression as well, with 7 chapters each consisting of 10 puzzles and 1 optional puzzle, connected by story segments. There aren't enough easter eggs and character development is lacking. More could be done with the science fiction elements as well.

Having done all this exploration, I wouldn't say it has a massive amount of replay value aside from looking at the story with a different perspective and potentially trying to solve puzzles in a different way. That said, the amount of enjoyment I got out of the game more than justifies the already reasonable price, in my opinion.In general, the game runs well on my system. Running at max settings on a GTX 1080 at 3440x1440, I never dipped below 60fps. However, the framerate appears to be hard capped at 60fps and while 21:9 ultrawide resolutions are available in the settings menu, it doesn't seem to have true ultrawide support, opting to crop the image on the top and bottom of the screen rather than rendering more horizontally. While not optimal, it is still very playable, with the only real annoyance for me being the audio log screens displaying partially cropped. Hopefully this is something that can be addressed in a future update.EDIT: As of v1.2, the 60FPS cap has been removed"

This game allows you to bend the rules in a few places.I can count at least 15 missions where I finished the round with orbs in my gun.  Some of which were simply because I redefined the boundaries of the puzzle while I played it.Whether or not this is an intended outcome, remains to be seen.What I can tell you is, it took me nearly 5 days to get the purchase to finally go through.  This involved me using my cell phone app.  Once the title showed up in my library, I had all sorts of download issues.Total time spent fixing Steam, Nvidia Drivers, router settings, etc. so that I could play the game... was about 30 hours.Not including the actual download, which, thanks to slow internet services in my area, and Server issues on Steam side, was just under 5 hours.I have completed the ENTIRE game in just about 8 hours... or so my playtime shows... This included frustration breaks (I will not spoil it, but it was a total facepalm moment, me thinking that all of a sudden they put parkour in the game).For the price, the total package is pretty enjoyable.For someone who has not played portal, or Talos Principle, this game might take you a lot longer.  I tend to be somewhat of an expert at these types of games... Just wish that I had this kind of luck getting the game installed.I recommend playing this game BEFORE you play Portal or Portal 2... you will enjoy it a lot more.I then recommend that you play Portal 1 at least... where the heck have you been, that game is amazing.So yeah.  If your stars align, and you can get this game installed in a matter of minutes, and have a somewhat Beefy computer... (I turned all my settings to low or off, except TEXTURES, which I set to Ultra)... you can be playing a mighty fine game, fine LOOKING as well, in less time than it takes to beat it.The only Negative that I have about the game, is that Europa is only about 1/8th the size of Earth, which makes it smaller and have less gravity than our moon, which is 1/6th the size of our planet.

Not only were the developers on-point with fixing the issues on launch, but the game itself is highly entertaining.  The atmosphere is fitting, the dialogue is immersive and not fake-sounding like many games, and it's simply a fun puzzle game to play.You are exploring a research lab on Europa, solving puzzles along the way.  Puzzle segments follow a pattern of introducing a new concept and building upon it, adding concepts learned from previous segments, Portal-style.  Puzzle segments are separated from each other by some chambers which provide the story and add mystery.  These chambers can be easily passed by, but to immerse yourself in the game, I strongly suggest reading every log, listening to every report, and just trying to find all the story elements that you can.Even a few minutes in, I already had decided that I loved the game.

That is, you're guided through from one puzzle to the next, with no chance of backtracking (though you can load chapters in the menu).Sadly the creators played it safe and did not include any hard puzzles, even the optional ones are fairly easy. Playing it casual, reading the extra documents etc for backstory, as well as doing the optional puzzles along the way, it took me about 6 hours to reach the 7th (final) chapter.The story is very hit and miss for me, it starts out well but quickly devolves to a bland mix of well-known sci-fi elements, spoiling almost all twists and turns the story offers.To sum it up, it's not a bad game, but it's not a shining star like Portal or The Talos Principle.

While some parts are somewhat predictable and others seem to have slight plot holes, as a whole I thoroughly enjoyed immersing myself in the story. If anything, I’d personally recommend The Turing Test for this and not its gameplay elements (though that's not to say they're bad).-Easy achievements.If that’s your thing. Nothing is missable besides the optional puzzles which you’d have to purposefully skip. Everything else is story progression related.-Graphics.Impressive, although heavy on the lighting and lens flares at pointsNeutral:-Puzzles.As someone who's not necessarily good at puzzle games I found that quite a few of the puzzles were too easy and required little to no thinking. This is not to say that they were all like this, there was a very small handful that had me stuck thinking that they were impossible for a while. Overall, I feel like the puzzles could have been a little more difficult.-Length.Although it’s a bit short at 5-8 hours for 100% completion (8 is the time the developers put, 5 is what I had), I felt like this prevented the game from feeling too dragged out and therefore wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. However, value for money is a problem here.Cons:-Motion sickness.The game gave me motion sickness which I've never experienced before, and after some research in the forums, I found out that this is a common problem and can limit some people to only playing for short periods of time before needing a break.-Replayability.Puzzles have to be solved in a certain way, and therefore the only reason you’d play this more than once would be to explore the story again as you’d remember most of the puzzle solutions."

Recently those games have blended philosophy into their narratives, and that's fine. This one is about humanity vs AI, what it means to be conscious, how far scientific boundaries should be pushed, that sorta thing. The story is decent enough with a fairly significant twist in the middle of the game, but some of the voice work from the side characters (which is mostly in audio clips) is a little off.Graphically this game is perfectly fine. It's far from bad, and it makes good use of Unreal 4 to deliver crisp visuals without a performance hit, but it's a little too shiny and glossy for my taste - there were a couple of rooms where the lighting effects were so strong that they obscured puzzle elements from certain angles - that's a big no in this sort of game. The sound design was also 'fine' - nothing to write home about but not garishly awful. Importantly the tracks are long enough that unless you get really stuck in a room you won't hear it obviously loop.If you're just here for the puzzles and have experience with this sort of game then this one won't be much of a challenge - I could count the number of puzzles that stumped me for a significant amount of time on one hand. A few puzzles have multiple solutions which is interesting for games like this and a huge plus is that we keep getting introduced to new puzzle mechanics throughout the entire span of the game, which a lot of other titles in this genre do not do.The bottom line is that if you liked games like Portal, Antichamber and The Talos Principle then you'll also like this but if you haven't already played any of those games that I just mentioned then play those first - they're all better than this one."

Your AI companion is about as interesting as a rock, and a monotone voice that just begs me to beat the levels faster. The puzzles are extremely simple. There was never a stumper or an ""aha"" moment for me. The plot is painfully predictable, and the subtext not subtle in the slightest.If this is one of your first games into the 3D puzzle genre it would actually be fun, in which case I wouldn't dissuade you from it, the puzzles are somewhat compelling and the logic behind them is enjoyable enough, but if you're a puzzler veteran this is a game you can skip."

It's basic Unreal Engine graphic, which is good, since we can focus on solving those puzzles (I'm not joking, in Talos Principle, I spent so much time sight seeing, which is good too, but somehow makes you take a bit too long to finish), and the sound atmosphere and music score are discreet and help you focus.Well, I liked that game obviously.

I've played games that look good and usually they run like trash because of optimization, but this game runs well.Cons:The puzzles are a bit TOO annoying at times. Now don't get me wrong, I can beat them regardless of this. Most of the time though you come across a puzzle that isn't very challenging or hard to comprehend, it just takes a lot of time. Those are the ones that sort of ruin the game for me.This is nitpicky, but sometimes the storyline feels like it's dragging. Like for example, a sentence of a voiceline will be for one test room, then another sentence of the voiceline will happen at the next room. I mean, come on. They're purposely trying to lengthen the amount of puzzle rooms and keep the player awaiting more voicelines.Lastly, the only other thing I can think of that is also sorta nitpicky, would be the lens flare and special effects at certain times being kinda crazy. Like you'll walk into a room and it's SO BRIGHT AAAAAAA MY EYES. It's either the lighting effects or just the overall coloring of the game to make most of the rooms white. They try to avoid this by adding little different colored lights in certain areas, which helps a bit, but it's still noticeably annoying.Overall: This is a good game for the pricetag.

Please note: my total playtime recorded on Steam not only involves the completionist playthrough, but also a lot of time where the game was paused when I needed to leave partway through a puzzle, playing the alpha build, etc. So, it was actually about 8-9 hours of actual playing time, for me, which will vary widely depending on how you pick up on the puzzles.The GameplayThe gameplay mechanics and set-up are impossible not to immediately compare to Portal, with The Talos Principle mixed in. Essentially, you are guided and caught up on the story via an AI companion, needing to work your way through an extensive series of puzzles, learning more of the story as you proceed, These puzzles involve using a series of energy cubes and energy bolts (fired into place with one mouse button, and retrieved for use with the other), along with switches and other mechanics to find your way through the locked doorway and into the next room to the next puzzle.The StoryEach of the seven ""chapters"" of the game includes ten puzzles, as well as one ""hidden"" (not really - if you learn where one is, they're obvious after that) optional puzzle. The optional puzzles, as well as the concluding room of each chapter, are used to most greatly advance the plot of the game via audio recordings and written files and other items, though there will also be dialogue between you and TOM, the AI interface, as you enter every room. In the interest of a spoiler-free review, I won't go into any real detail here, but the story is engaging and develops at a good pace that keeps you interested, with a really nice twist (which also adds a great new gameplay element partway through). That said, there are also some very noticeable plot holes in the end, and while it is nice to have two options of an ending, it is disappointing that which choice you make makes no real difference to the game. So, it's good, but flubs a bit at the end.The PuzzlesThere are a lot of puzzles in this game, and in a fairly wide variety. They often feel like they lean on the easy side, but as the game developed and more elements came into the picture, many did become truly challenging. This is especially true where new rules and gameplay dynamics were formed in the process - you wouldn't know something could be done until it finally occured to you to try. Things can feel a little repetitive at times, as you are, essentially, repeatedly finding a way to get through the locked door by manipulating the energy in the right way. But, as a fan of the Portal games and such, I really enjoyed having a new incarnation along those lines, as there are far too few such games available."

The 'sci-fi 3D puzzler with a narrator' genre.If you've not played Portal or The Talos Principle (how did you get here?), I'd suggest you pick up one of those instead.If you have, well, you won't find all that much originality here, but everything is competent enough.The story is your usual philosophical sci-fi fare, with an interesting enough premise and some cool moments but a few flaws in execution (writing that sometimes feels weak, some questionable voice acting, etc).The puzzles are fun enough. New mechanics are constantly introduced, which keeps things fresh. I liked that the puzzle rooms mostly never get too big and complicated. This does mean the difficulty never gets all that high, so if you're after that feeling of inadequacy you get when you start having to tab out and scour youtube for poorly edited video solutions you might be disappointed.I completed the storyline in - apparently - 5.4 hours. That might have been a little disappointing if I hadn't picked it up on sale.All in all, a cautious recommendation."

It doesn't have portals but it's much more serious than Portal 2 but still rich in story and choices, and it's published by Square Enix. The Turing Test makes you think a lot about life while playing and even after you beat it. It makes you think about morality and logic. Even while playing, the game pulls you into twists and turns and makes your job sound more crucial than before. There are different endings to this game and that's one of the reason why it makes this game great. However, in this game the two endings are neither good nor bad. It's simply up to how you view your prospectives.In the end, I'd value this game as much as I'd value Portal 2. They're both great games!-10/10"

It feels like the developers of this game saw how goodtaloswas and decided they wanted to make their own puzzle game, that sort of uses the same formula. It's just that this game feels far inferior.The puzzles are easy, i never had any real problems solving any of them.

But if you have not playedtalos or the portal gamesyet, prioritize those, as they are superior in every way. Only buy this game if you have nothing else to play first.The devs could have made this game so much better with some variation, more complex puzzles and a deeper and original story.

You awake to the voice of an AI that your character has an obvious repoir with.

The main puzzle mechanic focuses on power management. Each puzzle chamber contains several objects which require power to function, including doors, lifts, moving platforms and magnets. You have a gun which can absorb balls of energy from sockets placed on the wall, and then fire it into different sockets to power the connected objects. The challenge comes from the fact that you never have enough power to turn everything on at the same time.The complexity starts to increase as you discover that there are different types of power, represented by different colours. Blue is always on, green turns on and off at regular intervals, and red only works for a limited time. For example, if you use blue power with a moving platform, it will move to its second position and stay there. Red will send the moving platform on a return journey one time, while green will make the platform constantly move back and forth.Other puzzle mechanics include the obligatory inclusion of pressure plates that can be weighed down by objects/yourself, and towards the end of the game you’ll be able to remotely control a robot to perform actions in areas of the chamber that you can’t reach yourself.There’s a decent story about a research facility on one of Jupiter’s moons, some missing scientists and the AI who controls the facility. The main theme is about the difference between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which is a topic I usually find quite interesting. Voice acting is pretty good.I didn’t encounter any bugs, and I completed the game in 6 hours. Controls are fully rebindable, although you can’t use arrows for movement because left/right arrows will turn you instead of strafing (a potential solution on the forums didn’t work for me).If you like puzzle games, you should enjoy playing The Turing Test, however due to the length I’d recommend picking it up on a sale.

The story is an interesting one and brings up a number of topics such as what it means to be a conscious entity, if A.I. can truly be conscious, and what it means to be free. The story is definitely the strongest point of the game and while it's themes are by no means unique or fresh, they are executed well enough.Where the game falls short is in the puzzles and the gameplay. There are 70 puzzles in the game (77 if you count the bonus puzzles) and in my opinion they are far too easy. Personally, I didn't get hung up on a puzzle until I was in the 40s and even then, once I realized the mechanic that I had to take advantage of I didn't encounter a challenge until at least the last 20 puzzles. The primary reason is that there just aren't enough in-game mechanics when manipulating elements in the puzzles. The difficultly curve is quite flat.If you've played Talos Principal and enjoyed the story and the puzzles, I do not recommend this game.

Especially the first half of the game or so was really easy. Later on I needed to think about how to solve it, which was better. The puzzles are all in chambers very similar to Portal's test chambers.The game is too short and too easy and even the optional puzzles are not so hard, in here you need some more out-of-the-box thinking. The first optional chamber can be hard though, when you happen to miss the clue, like I did.Conclusion:A nice and enjoyable game but 20 euros is too much for such a short game. I really prefer Portal 2, or Quern - Undying Thoughts which are in the same price category. Way longer and way more challenging games. It's not really comparable to The Talos Principle.It's a pity you can only choose Yes and No, I can't make up my mind.The game is really not bad, but it's overpriced, easy, short, and not original enough.I would recommend buying it when it is on sale."

,Recommended,499520,28925538,Posted: 1 January,all,Dazirius,"So, another game completion and it was a damned good one.Anyone who knows me will know by now that I'm endlessly fascinated by transhumanism, AI, human digitisation, space travel, robotics/androids and all those lovely things.Cue ""The Turing Test"" by Bulkhead Interactive(http://store.steampowered.com/app/499520/), a first person puzzler in the vein of Portal and Cube. I notice just now that the protagonist is supposed to be called Ava Turing. If that's too silly and ""on the nose"" for you, just ignore it. She's referred to exclusively as Ava throughout IIRC so it won't come up during play.Firstly, I purchased The Turing Test under the misapprehension that it was playable in VR. A quick look on the game forum on Steam threw up a thread where someone was complaining that it kept firing up in VR mode when they didn't want it to and they had to unplug their Rift. I took that to mean that it was playable in VR. Unfortunately, had I looked a little further I'd have seen that it was never intended to be VR compatible and the experience described in the forum post was a glitch. More on this at the end.The puzzles primarily involve moving power sources from one socket to another using a tool similar to the gravity gun from Half-Life (specifically toward the end when it's charged up so you can grab those balls of energy). There are a small number of variants to the puzzle types and getting to grips with each room is normally just a matter of familiarising yourself with what's available then applying the known rules. None of the puzzles were *particularly* hard, although a couple had me head-scratching for a minute or two.The visuals are excellent and the story is very engaging. A couple of the narrative offshoots could have done with being explored a little further, but there wasn't all that much time available to do so I suppose. None of the game felt empty from a story perspective, and the little side areas with the voice recordings and computer terminals raised the immersion level considerably.The voice acting was great, especially the AI character, T.O.M. who was both reassuring and deeply chilling in roughly equal measure throughout.There are some very interesting questions raised during play through the discourse between T.O.M. and Ava. These topics are shown to have been long in discussion with the rest of the crew of the station which was interesting to discover from the voice logs.I have 6 hours clocked on this title, but I suspect it may have counted a break while I left it running. I wouldn't expect a seasoned Portal player to take more than about 4-5 hours over this one, but if you're interested in the field, it's a great game to play through. It reminded me of SOMA, but more AI and less DigiHuman.Highly recommended for fans of first person puzzlers and especially for the subset of those who are interested in AI and the nature of consciousness.So, back to the VR thing. I went back to the forum and found that someone had actually asked why there was no VR support. The developer said they didn't have the resources to run a VR build alongside the main development track. From that I wonder whether they, and indeed other developers, might be missing the point.One of the great things about VR is that it can add a level of immersion that's just impossible on a monitor and you don't have to do much other than provide head-look. If Bulkhead meant that they couldn't afford to redevelop the game to support or require motion tracked controllers then sure, that's fine, don't. You need only provide stereo output from the first person camera and map head rotation to mouse-look. That's enough. For me, that's as far as I'd *want* you to go.Motion controls make some kind of sense when you're shooting targets with conventional weapons, or manipulating oddly shaped puzzle pieces, or slotting blocks into holes. Beyond that, they're just not needed. The gamepad is an excellent input device even in VR. If I can play your game on mouse and keyboard using WSAD, left and right mouse-button and maybe space for jump and ctrl for crouch, you're already well within the button count for VR + Pad.Furthermore, if you're concerned about people getting sick (and I'm still not sure how much of a problem that actually is) your development track isn't so divergent that you're *only* releasing for VR. No motion tracked controllers remember. So people with weak stomachs can play on the monitor (with a pad or mouse and keyboard) and those who don't get ill get the benefit of the immersion of VR.What has it cost you? Maybe you needed to get a headset in to prove it works (although you could just as well get vRidge/RiftCat and use one of the fancy phones your devs already have ;) ), maybe a couple of your guys and gals had to spend an hour with Unreal's VR plugin so they knew what they were doing. We're talking a few hundred bucks, possibly. Go the RiftCat route and it'll be about $50 total.That's all it cost, but what you get is VR compatibility at the level that works best for everyone, and that's worth a lot."

This is true even of a game like Portal, and those that came before it. It's not surprising that Portal has influenced so much of modern gaming, and the influences here are obvious -- a first-person puzzler with AI themes and bare rooms. It's also a formidable task to fill Portal's shoes. So at first, I was surprised to see some clever uses of familiar mechanics and I was getting drawn into the story and gameplay. Near the end though, it sort of fell apart.Story:It's refreshing to see a serious and thoughtful take on the Turing Test as a thought-experiment along with all the related thought-experiments presented. The medium of a video game gives the player have ample time to process it all and see it play out in a narrative. The twist is also nice. However, every plot point gets repeated and rehashed about five or six times each.I correctly predicted that there would be a Pivotal Decision to make at the end. (Not a bad thing. It would have felt weird if there wasn't, but a single-ending scenario could have well been pulled off, given the game's theme.) The problem was that this was a very one-sided, easy decision to make. I know that's easy to say since I was not Ava, but she didn't make a good case for herself at all.Gameplay:The puzzles were on the easy side. More than one of them seem broken -- I was able to complete these puzzles without needing to use certain parts of them. The rest were well-designed and forced the player to think laterally, to the tune of Portal's puzzles.The Turing Test does enough to set itself apart from its predecessors, but doesn't really succeed on its own. Still an okay game to get on sale."

76561198159713463,Recommended,499520,33905764,Posted: 30 July,all,surtech5,"TL;DRThe Turing Test is an enjoyable experience, much like watching “Street Fighter the Movie”. You know it’s not good. The plot makes little sense. Character repeatedly do stupid things that they should know not to do. And many puzzles could easily be solved with the abilities (such as crawling, leaning, and climbing) than anyone over the age of 14 has. But the gameplay is enjoyable enough for a few hours, and doesn’t over stay it’s welcome.I got this cheap for $10 and think that that was a good price for what I got.WARNING: This game chugged along for me. After turning off all the useless graphic options (like anti-aliasing ) and lowering the others it could barely do 30fps which is well below my laptops standard output. I don’t know if this will be an issue with everyone else, but it was for me.Also, this game has intense and constant changes in brightness, with one of the strongest bloom effects I have ever seen in a game. This WILL cause eye strain and I would recommenced playing this only in a well lit area.Review:As far as Gameplay goes, it is exactly what you think it would be. A sub par first person puzzler in the vein of Q.U.B.E., Quantum Conundrum, and some obscure Valve I seem to have forgotten the name of… The rooms are nonsense with only a brief line thrown in about why the rooms were built that doesn’t add up even when you don’t think about it; and believe me, you will. The difficulty spikes dramatically. And the mechanics can be… Odd… Let me explain.This gun you have (that comes out of nowhere and has no purpose other than to solve puzzles) can only hold 3 charges and has no way to swap them out after being collected other than to shoot them into a receptor. Why? Also, you get a gun that you use literally 3 times in the entire game. And only one of those times is to solve a puzzle! And the puzzles. All but two(from what I found) can be solved from any state. And both that require a restart if you mess up come at the end of the game; one of them LITERALLY is the end of the game!And then there’s the other end of the spectrum. Many puzzles have obstacles like 4 foot platforms you have to lower before you can climb. 6 by 8ft holes in the wall that you have to find a way around instead of crawling through. And energy cores you could easily take with you if she would only stick her hand around a corner to use her gun.At the same time, many puzzles can have corners you can cut or just be skipped almost entirely by the run function. I can almost guarantee you the ability to run was not in the original game and was added later. It does not mesh well with the puzzles at all! That being said, I quite enjoyed that oversight, and was always looking for cheeky ways to undo the developer’s designs.This whole things seems unfinished. Just a collage of partial ideas put together to see what works. It’s rushed and semi broken, but that almost gives it a sort of charm… A charm that gets old fast, but luckily the game is quite short. And I will give it credit for being quite good at teaching concepts naturally… Congratulations due where congratulations are due; it’s only fair.Now the story is something truly interesting. See you play a murderer named Gill T… Wait… No, that was from a story I wrote in Middle School. Ah yes, you play a woman named Ava Turning who works with a robot struggling with being self aware… Yes… Very on the nose that name is.There’s really not much to say that you can’t already guess. The dialogue is laughably bad, more so when you remember these are supposed to be astronauts. It makes sense coming from the A.I. as he is going through ‘cyber puberty’ and has many a reason to be upset and confused. TOM (The A.I.) is easily the best part of this game and strangely enough, the voice of reason.All of… ‘that’, culminates to an epilogue that, if you are like me, you will sit through 4 times to see all the slightly different endings (honestly its 2 endings with the ‘bad ending’ having 3 different flavors… two of which are the same flavor inverted… But you don’t know that till you try them out). This segment is an unskipable long 3 minute wall down two corridors, followed by a minute of watching characters move on their own… make that 3 minutes if you get a certain bad ending). It’s a pain, cannot be skipped, and requires a you to be sitting at your computer interacting the entire time.So what does it all come to? Well avoiding spoilers (Ava, and a second astronaut decide to kill the AI because they want to go home, despite being infected with a virus that has a near 100% chance of ending life on earth as we know it! And their plan? Walk into his guarded core, while he’s watching, and slowly disassemble him… While he has full camera and gun controls in the room… I… Cannot fathom their plan. And should you shoot just one, the other will rush to a control panel to kill you instantly.. so what was the point of the 2 minute disassembly if you could do that the entire time?)… Nothing. I understand why its over, but when the only story you have is building up two major problems and then neither is addressed… That leaves you feeling used. And seeing all the different endings? Well, right after your choice, cut to unskipable credits so… Don’t expect a resolution or consequence."

Unlike something like Portal, the puzzles require no manual ability at all (there is only a few puzzles where you even need to press the jump or run buttons). As expected, there is a good amount of readable pickups and no shortage of pretentious armchair phylosophy. Despite the developer's efforts, some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy, specially several of the AI's lines. There is a story about exploration in Europa and finding the missing crew, but unfortunately after a very strong start the narrative doesn't develop into anything interesting, with every twist and ending being evident since the first minute.That being said, what makes me not recommend the title is its gameplay. It is, simply put, way too easy. You will solve many of the puzzles accidentally while trying to figure out its components, and the difficulty curve is poorly handled, with extremely easy puzzles showing up late in the game. You may become stuck at some point if you fail to understand some of the mechanics as they are introduced, but your success is otherwise guaranteed. Even the optional puzzles are extremely easy.This, unfortunately, makes the game boring. You enter a room, see the elements around, immediately know what to do, and then proceed through the motions. Since the game is completely linear (except for a few optional puzzles), there is nothing positive for me to say about the gameplay other than, fortunately, the game is short.Note also that it seems to have been developed using a buggy, custom version of the Unreal Engine. It doesn't handle Alt+Tab correctly (it will lose sound on return, amongst other issues) and also likes to change your desktop resolution, messing up with your background windows. I've not seen any other Unreal title do this."

It feels not enough things are cleared up, as the ending is very abrupt.Spoilers ahead:The main character in the last portion of the game becomes increasingly unreasonable, which feels uncharacteristic for scientists.

The difficult curve is pretty smooth as a result, which can make it feel easy.That said, some of the puzzles will require some of out-of-the-box thinking, and you'll feel smart when you figure them out.  The curve works well here as nuggets of the story gradually revealed - if the puzzles are meted out too few and too difficult too soon, interest in the story would decline due to the long pauses between bits.  Having a series of easier ""educational"" puzzles with some tougher ones near the ends of a chapter creates a natural pacing that seemed to be repeated, but quite effectively.- Information: You learn something about the story - easy puzzle intro chatter.- Contemplation: ""What is a man?"" style philosophy chatter- Calm: The tougher, longer puzzles with no character speaking- The Storm: Chapter Finale, Chapter Intro - big spoilerific stuff revealed related the first two items, with each chapter building on the last.All in all, it's a well put-together puzzle solving experience with an interesting story that does exactly what the title suggests it should do.

The use of different types of obs, platforms and light bridges is intersting. But only a few are really challenging logic puzzles.

I know many would jump to Portal comparisons, but I find this much closer to The Talos Principle - you're solving puzzles as a voice speaks to you and there is lots of reading as you consider the ethics and philosophy of your situation - and Quantum Conundrum - it's linear. Portal-style [dark-]humor isn't really present, but the writing is still excellent.I found the puzzles to have good variety and I did not notice any trapping situations. You can't die. The mechanics are always made clear before being used in a more difficult puzzle, and are simple to pick up and easy to understand. A majority of the puzzles are simple to solve, but some do require some careful thinking. Overall, a great puzzle solving experience.I normally don't look for much of a story in these kinds of puzzle games, but the one I was presented with here was masterfully done. If you're willing to look past the minor plot holes, it is very well written and the voice acting is excellent. I love the integration of the story with the gameplay, especially the twist halfway through the game that introduces a new puzzle mechanic.As far as polish goes, the game is excellent.

They are mostly variations of classic bridge problems, get the order right so the wolf desn't eat the chicken and the chicken doesn't eat the seed, although here its about unlocking doors in the right order.  The game itself is divided into 7 chapters each with 10 puzzles of incresing difficulty and a single optional room.  With each chapter comes a new piece that can be used in the puzzles.

I’ve never played The Talos Principle, and Portal 2 was just history now in my memories.  Maybe because of that, I enjoyed The Turing Test quite a lot, and would recommend it.Things I like about this game compare to Portal 2:-	Puzzles are easier.  Much easier in fact, to the point that many would probably feel this as a con.  I actually like easy puzzles where they don’t frustrate the hell out of me, and in the end either to accept the frustration as defeat and consult YouTutbe, or be ready to get frustrated even more.-	Story is more densely distributed in the game, more philosophical, and succinct.-	Same as Portal 2, the general Sci-fi vibe is irresistible.Some cons:-	Ladder climbing causes full pov shaking, and super bright lighting may induce motion sickness and other unpleasantness.-	“Optional” secret rooms are not really optional in order to understand the story of this game.  In general, the backstory could be a bit more fleshed out.-	Isn’t Portal 3 and has no Companion Cube.In the end, if you are someone who enjoys easier puzzles, likes sci-fi and interested in a story in AI, then this game is very much for you, like it is for me."

But the rest of the puzzles didn't really take much time to solve.  For a series of puzzles, moving through the game was surprising fast paced.The story was an interesting moral dilemma.  However I wish Sarah's and Ava's reasons for their decisions were more fleshed out in the conversation.  For all the talk about computers emulating people and/or becoming sentient, I thought deeper issue was about whether logic or empathy was a better source of human conscience.The game world (textures, models, level of detail, etc.) was serviceable but nothing to write home about.  My only criticism was the constant dimming and brightening of the screen as you moved around and happen to look too closely at light source.  That got really annoying really fast; fortunately the game isn't that long.

I would say that if you enjoyed Portal, you will enjoy this game. Just go in, knowing that it comes from a smaller developer, and it doesn't quite have the flow of Portal's storyline, or funny narritive.I found the puzzles a good deal harder than most of Portal 1's, and perhaps on the same difficulty as some Portal 2 levels. Keep in mind that some of the puzzles are harder because you haven't been as well introduced to that specific game mechanic. (example: On one puzzle you use a light bridge to move inbetween a wall, so that you can jump on the light bridge to avoid the locked door. There is zero talk, or game demonstration that this is a method you can use.)I enjoyed the game, thought it was worth the Autumn sale price, and I hope the devs are working on some sort of sequel."

,Not Recommended,499520,25355369,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,Muffins,"The Turing Test is an interesting idea with some middlingly hard puzzles with some satifying solutions, but with a narrative that starts strong and ends in a mess.The following is a spoiler filled section describing some of that in detail.The narrative is just a huge mess and seems to contradicts itself at times. A few examples: Some of the optional content alludes to Tom existing as conscious being that can become jealous, and at other times it states that it is infallible because it is just a computer and can't be wrong as a being of pure logic. We could write that off as Tom thinking whatever it wanted to in order to support its case, but in any way you cut it, this came off to me as a major mixed message.Additionally, there are multiple sections in which Ava is told that she is being controlled and has no free will. However, in both these segments the player loses control of Ava, implying that she is being pulled against her will. This would be a great narrative device, except that Ava is pulled towards Sarah, who is informing her that she is a drone without free will. So, instead of the loss of control becoming an allegory for Tom's control over Ava, it implies that Sarah is using the same implant connection to control Ava as well. This ends up implicitly painting Sarah as the game's antagonist to whom the player should be pitted against.This stacks on top of the dialogs between Tom and Ava near the end of the game where Ava condones the ground team's experimentation on themselves with an alien pathogen. Which has major problems of its own. Its heavily implied that the virus would put an end to all future children for those infected by some optional audio logs. In addition, rational people of science wouldn't risk exposing the human population at large, to an unknown pathogen, without a massive battery of testing. Especially if no known means of 'curing' the pathogen existed.All this ends up pushing all the endings into feeling like the 'bad' ending, which wouldn't even be really be a negative really, except all of the resolutions to the game end abruptly without any form of epilogue.All this isn't to say that there aren't some good moments and some interesting pieces of narrative and events that play out, but overall the game feels like a lot of great foreshadowing that end up missing the mark on the payoff. I'd highly recommend that you wait for a big sale on this one, or the inevitable humble bundle."

Not bragging. Seriously, Read on.The puzzles are VERY clever in creation, but the game is almost too good at warming you up to each new puzzle. By the time you encounter something that would otherwise be challenging, you're able to solve the whole thing immediately because it's simply comprised of many smaller puzzles you've already seen. It almost reminded me of ""The Talos Principle"" in that there seemed to be far too many similar puzzles. This made it seem to drag slightly, with the dialog unfolding at a strangely slow rate.The trouble in all puzzle games is that they all have a theme.Talos Principle: PerceptionPneuma: PerspectivePortal: Position......OH MY LORD SO MANY P WORDS!!! WHAAT IS THIS!?!?!?!The point is, once you've solved the game itself, you've already solved every puzzle it can throw at you. Life lesson.SO! The best puzzle games are the ones that keep you guessing.Antichamber did a phenomenal job of this, with Pneuma, the predecessor to turing test, being a great second place.I know I said Pneuma had a theme that could be exploited to help you solve the puzzles, but regardless, every puzzle was strikingly unique in construction and the monologue was both introspective and hillarious!If you ever get the chance, I'd highly recommend both of these games."

I found it quite thought provoking , albeit some of the trivia and dialogs may be pretty obvious for hardcore nerds (i.e. impossible to operate machinery from Earth in EUROPA as latency is to high , duh)Second is the soundtrack and voice acting, both are really strong , music adds to the loneliness feel and AVA's responses feel very alive, although, she kind of figures everything slowly ;)Game has two endings, devs did not hold it back and can be reviewed by replaying epilogue, which is good as I felt I would be going to youtube anyway :DAll in all a good game and I recommend it for sci-fi fans or if you find it on sale, although 15pounds is not really a deal braker if you are into sci-fi ,as game can provide more thoughts than any tripple A title"

As is par for the genre nowadays, the story is excellent and well written, with The Turing Test exploring themes of artificial intelligence, morality, and differences in how humans and computers think. Thematically, it's more the philosophical approach of The Talos Principle than it is the humour of Portal. It's an excellent, well written, thought-provoking story with compelling dialogue. As a mathematician, it was nice to see aspects of machine learning accurately described.However, the puzzle game is let down by the puzzles. There are 7 chapters of 10 puzzles, and it's not until the 6th chapter that you actually have to think. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kitten on LSD could complete the first five chapters pawcuffed. Average completion time seems to be about 5 hours, although the majority of that is sent mindlessly charging through puzzles (because they just don't require thinking).If you want a good story without a good game attached, a book might be a better choice. If you haven't played The Talos Principle or Portal, I'd recommend trying those first. If you loved The Talos Principle (like I did) you'll probably like this too, despite the feeling that you're back in infant school after finishing your doctorate."

Many of the earlier puzzles you can solve without a moment of hesitation, and even ""over-solve"" - have some items left at the end, or not used something the level offered. It's not a challenge to complete, and thus is more a walking simulator than a puzzle game that challenges you.What is really annoying is the attempt at the ""Turing Test"" philosophy. While factually accurate, they screw things up by having TOM, a computer clearly capable of human-like conversation, as the ""adversary"". Then they try to patch it up with some recorded conversation where TOM presents ""non-human"" thoughts, just to fix the problem of having a computer capable of completing the Turing Test right in front of the player, who is still charged with providing a ""human element"" allegedly required to complete these puzzles. Any grad student could implement an algorithm to solve them, just saying. The Turing Test is a remarkable philosophical concept and worth of study and investigation, but this game does not do it justice.It had some potential, but production time was wasted on a needlessly rich level design with a weak story. Play if you like easy puzzles, but if you like hard puzzles, there are better games out there. With philosophy. Or a funny story."

I don't see how anyone can say otherwise when there's hard light bridges involved.The story draws you in, but felt a little hacked at times in my opinion. Just the whole ""you gotta save a crew in space"" thing is a little cliché at this point, but I felt like this game pulled it off.T.O.M. is a little annoying; I swear he talks about tesing more that GLaDOS does, and the philosophy lessons get a little stale after a while; I kept wondering how many times they would bring up the Chinese room and how many times they would say ""Turing test"", but if you look past it, it does add a dimension to T.O.M.'s character, I suppose. The writing was also a little too revealing at times, the whole M. Night Shamalanian twist was almost spoiled for me at the get go in the computer room.If you've read other reviews that said the puzzles were easy, they're somewhat right, some puzzles I got right away and felt unsatisfying, but some did stump me, for the record, but not as many as Portal or Talos did. But do remember no puzzle game is completely filled with head scratchers, and some are just bound to be easy. It does get interesting where they introduce the ""possession"" (idk what else to call it) element, and I would say once you get there, it does get more complex.Overall if you have the mental capacity to look past little writing annoyances and just see it as a puzzle game, or if you want an easier puzzle game where you can just turn your brain off, I'd recommend it.

I could simply end the review here, but there are some minor issues I feel obligated to report to you, potential buyer.- Some of the ""clues"" to the story are in audio format, kind of hard to hear, and with no subtitles. It's a design choice, to make it really hard to understand, BUT... Some people, like me, just don't like to play with the volume too loud, so it's impossible to even try to listen to anything. Not to mention deaf people.- DON'T PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. I started with a controller, because this is the type of game that is perfect to play while laying in bed, the computer connected to the TV. But, at later levels, timing will be VERY important, and it's simply impossible to aim precisely where you need to, within the time window you're given. Or I just really suck at playing with controllers!Anyway, those are the small issues I found. Other than that, the game is great, and you should spend your time playing it, not reading reviews!

The puzzles were difficult enough to give you a feeling of accomplishment without being so hard that you feel they are impossible.....(well, maybe a couple).  I think they did an excellent job bringing up the thoughts of 'what is it to be human', 'what is free will', and can a machine be aware on the same level that a human can be.  As you progress through each room (room = puzle), you get three or four lines of dialog between the station AI and the human protagonest.  This seems to highten the sense that you are moving toward something special and not just solving puzzles.  The only negative I will give it is the ending.  It fits and is ejoyable, but like many games seems to view everything through a very simple ending.  The entire story gives the feeling that something spcial is going to happen but the ending does not really follow that feeling.  You can play it one of two ways and neither of those fit (in my opinion) with the magnatude of the discovery or of the caliber of people envovled (highly trained space engineers and scientists that should be capable of big picture thinking).   What you get is more like people you would meet at your local PTA meeting who have only one motivation, their own precious little snowflake, and be damn with everything and everyone else.   Don't get me wrong.  I loved the game  .....poor ending included.  Will gladly buy version II if it ever happens."

From a technical standpoint the game ran very smoothly and was perfectly stable without exception. Though if you decide to play this game with a gamepad as I did you may find the sensitivity of the analog sticks to be a little jarring at times. There are occasions where you may wish to manipulate an object in very small increments but find it difficult due to very hard swings in movement, but those issues are very minor and in no way played a serious role on my enjoyment of the game.Digging into the puzzle design I will say that this game definitely falls on the easy side of the overall landscape of puzzle games I've played. Coming from games like The Witness, Swapper, Portal/Portal 2, Steven's Sausage Roll, Talos Principle, etc. this game felt very tame from a difficulty standpoint. New ideas are introduced and then iterated on like any puzzle game, but they seem to only abstract each new concept a step or two beyond its most basic formation. This can be seen positively or negatively depending on your personal tastes. For myself it was one of the few real criticisms I would levy against the game. That said the easier difficulty does come with an added benefit, and that is its pacing.The Turing Test does an admirable job at keeping you constantly engaged in the story despite the gameplay being so disparate from traditional story telling devices. The relative ease of puzzle solving allows for the player to enter each new puzzle at a steady pace, where they are always greeted with more dialogue between the game's protagonists Ava Turing and Tom(Onboard AI). These conversations and the general story revolve around the various philosphical musings about what it is to be human, what constitutes consciousness, what is moral, and many of the other common tropes you would expect of a game that would call itself ""The Turing Test"". If you find these sorts of musings to be up your alley I would suspect this game has a lot to offer you. I applaud Bulkhead for attempting to tread out some of the more sophiscated notions in these debates, giving it at least a slight air of nuance allowing you to feel that you aren't just indulging in pure pop-science."

Just for the gameplay, if you liked those games, I highly recommend you this title. Some puzzles will get you to think out of the box. The name of the game was the best choice.Music, voice acting and graphics elevates this game to the category of art. Stunning visuals, engine well used, game performance is optimized; loading screens are short (Michael Bay would be proud of so many artistic lens flares, even if they're not anamorphic).What I think is odd was the object interaction... I would've loved to do more than just rotating things... but hey, nice modeling anyway... the gameplay is elsewhere, I know.That being said, the narrative style is good, the story is very interesting, the ending is kind of short, though. Two kinds of story development: 1) SEARCH and read every little thing that you can and you will get the whole picture... 2) SPEEDRUN. The latter misses a lot of good stuff. Only in gameplay this game is barely similar to the precedent titles... Story related it is just a whole different beast.Spoiler alert... please do not read until you've finished the game... you've been warned.I never really understood why Ava and the Cap were awekened in 2250 and the others in 2443... if its not a typo I can only have more questions if any of the situation is real or if it is just a test to evaluate TOM version with a human, completing the Turing Test and then letting this unshackled self aware AI interact with a team, making Ava expendable. Anyhow, a lot of reviews getting this thing wrong saying that TOM is a companion...The cutscenes when the character it moving with her own will is that: will. Faraday Cage proves it... you are reduced to be just TOM, and not Tom controlling Ava. Magnets have an effect on your view...If it doesn't strike you yet...stop thinking for a second that you're the human in the game and take your real place as TOM OS... an AI that developed opinions, moral thinking and that it is obsessed with objections to The Chinese Room and The Turing Test itself to prove humans in the crew that it is self-aware... conscious, capable of sarcasm, learning, creativity of some sort... reading Searle, Turing, even making your own choices in behalf of humanity. You're not Ava, you're a kind of an existentialist AI with existential dread in an extent, with a difficult choice: kill or be killed, kill the few or risk earth to perish... and for thatthis game is good and can make you get ""the feels"".8/10"

Fortunately, puzzles are laid out so that they will often act as instructions for the next ones, what makes solving them an easier task (most of the puzzles are easy anyway) and, to me at least, speaks of good level design. Don't get too confident though as these instructions may condition you to overlook far simpler solutions.I liked how the game built up the mystery, revealing only a little at a time, but that is also where its weakness lies. Maybe it's my fault for thinking the game was setting me up for some major revelation only to realize it doesn't, not really. The story seems pretty straightforward at first. You awake from cryogenic sleep aboard a space station orbiting Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter. T.O.M., the station's artificial intelligence reveals he's lost contact with the manned base on Europa so he's sending you to investigate. As you enter the base you encounter a series of puzzles you need to resolve in order to progress further. Who set up these tests and for what purpose is anyone's guess... for now.Spoilers follow...Eventually you'll find out that the crew on Europa discovered an organism that can continuously repair DNA, basically ensuring immortality, what caused a rift between Tom and the crew. Whereas the crew saw it as a great discovery that needed to be shared with Earth, Tom was of the opinion that the risks far outweighed the benefits in this case, seeing as the organism is indiscriminate and will most likely also ensure the immortality of all species as well as viruses and the like. Therefore, considering the crew was likely infected at that point, Tom tried to quarantine the astronauts on Europa, something that didn't sit well with them, not to mention it didn't go according to plan. Regardless, these revelations should have given Ava some pause, made her think that maybe Tom had a point. Unfortunately, their conversation on the matter goes about as well as it went with her fellow teammates, as Ava is determined to rescue them and return to Earth.As you solve these puzzles, Ava and Tom engage in a conversation about whether a machine can think and be creative. It is a conversation Tom already had with multiple crew members as evidenced by the numerous recordings you will find. I would say the bulk of the game focuses on this theme, using a story-arc introduced later (mentioned in the spoilers above) as a means to explore this question, to the detriment of that particular story-arc, which deserved to be explored more thoroughly.Unfortunately, given that Ava tends to ignore or outright dismiss most of what Tom has to say on the basis that he's a machine and therefore ""doesn't understand,"" the story feels lacking, as if it could've been even more thought-provoking if the creators had simply connected a few dots here and there. Indeed, in light of everything that happens, Ava should have had sufficient elements to review her adamant stance, making her at least doubt whose side she wants to be on.Then there's also the question of who created the puzzles and why. The first part is easy as it should be self-evident early on that they were designed by the crew to hamper your progress. To what end? That's another matter. It could be argued that it was to gain time in order for the crew to try and persuade you to their point of view (pointless since there's little doubt anyway). In fact, that's about the best explanation I can come up with seeing as the game doesn't provide you with a better one and further analysis would only serve to expose all the inconsistencies and loose ends. I'd hoped there would be a better answer but, sadly, there was no light at the end of this tunnel. If you can come up with something better and mind-bending, be my guest.LikeThe Swapper,The Turing Testknows how to set up an atmosphere and that is in no small part due to the mysteriously ethereal soundtrack composed by Sam Houghton and Yakobo. I most definitely recommend checking it out.While I don't regret for a second having purchased this game, I am somewhat saddened by the fact that it could've been better with but a few tweaks here and there. The ending simply doesn't live up to the incredible buildup in the way similar games likeThe SwapperorJ.U.L.I.A.: Among the Starsdid. It took me about 10 hours to complete and unlock all achievements (they are pretty straightforward) but it probably pays to go at it a second time to put things in perspective."

It's its own thing. The puzzles aren't too difficult and I actually enjoyed that. There were still a couple I had to think about for a few minutes, overall it was just a ton of fun gameplay-wise. The mechanics themselves and the way that you solve the puzzles was quite unique and it was a thoroughly enjoyable way to play the game.The graphics are absolutely fantastic for a $20 game. I could not be more thrilled about the lighting quality, the textures--it's an absolutely gorgeous game hands-down.But what kept me amazed and hooked the most was the story and the fantastic philosophy involved. A few different topics were covered in the game and there's some truly morally challenging things that are touched upon. The dialogue between the AI and the player is absolutely stellar--no pun intended. I thought it was extremely well handled, and the end of the game was truly awesome, IMO anyway.If you're looking for super intense, brain-wracking puzzles and that's all you care about, don't bother.

Without saying too much, it's about a woman and an AI working together to unravel the mysterious communications blackout from a scientific outpost on Jupiter's moon Europa.PRO --Excellent sound and voice acting.-Puzzles that lean on the casual side, with a large number that do not take too long individually to solve.-Terriffic narrative.CON --Very short.-Scenery gets a little repetitious.-Gameplay feels a bit ""casual"".VERDICT -If you enjoy games with a lot of story, easy gameplay, and aren't bothered by slow pacing and a lot of text, grab this game. It has just the right level of difficulty and is easy to pick up and run with.If you're on the fence and generally prefer more exciting, faster-paced games, wait for a good sale.Those who treat games like books or movies and collect them for their artistic merit or their ideas and thoughts, and aren't as put-off by a more casual experience, will probably enjoy this one.

When i first pressed escape after starting the game to go to the menu i thought it didn't support mouse navigation. It turns out you need to click to enable the moues in the menu. It's mostly just nitpicking but nothing major really.The puzzles were fun and challenging. At least the later ones but it is expected that there is some kind of learning curve.

Where Portal had a humorous dynamic, the Turning Test is introspective, invites contemplation on the nature of consciousness, and features moral ambiguity. Solving the puzzles (without portals) was not as inherently fun, but the game made up for it with its eerie qualities and suspense. While Portal felt more polished, the Turing Test was a more unique gaming experience---high praise for a predecessor. The playtime is between five and eight hours, depending on how completionist you are. I loved how the bonus puzzles rewarded you with more dialog and character insight. The story was the incentive. I wanted to find out how it would end, and when the end arrived, it was a great gaming experience.(I have not played the Witness or the Talos Principle; the aesthetics never appealed to me, but it's possible they cover similar themes.)"

Other than the short time it takes to finish the game, the ease of figuring out puzzle solutions, and the fact that it just isn't on the same tier as a game like Talos or Portal this game was pretty good. The storyline is predictable as well and there are no alternate endings no matter how you choose to play the final sequence.

So much steam workshop potential with this game.-View bobbing was always on which was distracting and I couldn't tell but it seemed like I was always sprinting when outside of a puzzle.

They're still a fun series to work through, and they keep the game and the story moving at a brisk pace. Unlike some other first-person puzzlers, though, in this game I enjoyed the story about as much as the puzzles. I'm not sure what I can say about why I liked the story without spoiling it, but ... it's a good premise with a couple of really good parts, one at the middle and one at the very end.To be a little more specific while hopefully still not spoiling anything significant: The ending presents the player witha moral dilemma and, where a conventional game would have an extended cutscene to show the player the outcome of their choice, this one just ends abruptly, leaving the player alone to ponder their decision and continue to doubt it.I found that approach much more satisfying than the usual obvious way of handling an ending like that."

So caveat lector.It's a brilliant allegory of the struggles of autistic people told through the filter of science-fiction. And how attempts to help neurotypicals is often met with dehumanising prejudice, belittling, and derision. I empathised with Tom's position, as it's one that I feel any autistic person can relate to.Of course, self-destructive neurotypical behaviours often don't get to quite the grand scale of triggering a planet-wide extinction event of every species (unless you count the growing concerns of various forms of pollution and overpopulation), usually their annihilation-focused efforts exist on a much smaller scale.I've been in a number of frustrating situations where this has happened. I've warned neurotypicals about the consequences of their actions, only to see my warnings come true every time. Sometimes I can only watch in horror. Giving me the agency to actually do something to stop them from causing others to suffer is nice, it's cathartic, but the story is still depressing.A neurotpical playing this game will likely view the AI as a moustache-twirling villain, unable to understand the consequences of sending a very deadly virus (that leaves people infertile) back to earth.

The problems, or puzzles, increase in difficulty as you progress through a total of 70 areas. You feel almost like a student being tutored for a technical exam, but it works fine, and there's a tangible satisfaction when you make it past each exit door (especially if you've employed non-logical tactics).The story-line concerns the age-old debate about man v. machine. Is human intelligence that different from that of machines (or vice versa), and if so, in what specific ways? The first comparison that springs to mind is, of course, Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey with T.O.M. playing the role of H.A.L. 9000. Other works in this genre include Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles and Isaac Asimov's robot laws. TTT is set in a similarly clean and sterile environment with a very limited cast. In TTT, there are effectively only you (Ava) and Sarah, with T.O.M. serving as a very ambiguous AI guide.TTT ends with a novel story twist that is bound to invite lots of discussions. But in my layman's opinion, Bulkhead doesn't actually add new perspectives to the fundamental question, choosing instead to present you with 'the usual suspects' e.g. the Chinese Room and the nature of human morality.The game design is very simple and modular with lots of details. Sadly, most of the objects that can be touched do absolutely nothing. Over time, this becomes so annoying that you have to wonder why Bulkhead even bothered to make e.g. 5 pencils that each can be touched but turn out to do nothing at all. But there is also a large variety of audio clips and written reports that add to the plot.So in conclusion, The Turing Test is definitely worth your money and time - expect something like 20-25 hours if you, like me, are a casual gamer of average intelligence."

It's not nearly as philosophically deep as TTP nor as challenging as Portal. Often I had the feeling that I solved the first part of a greater puzzle room only to find that that was it. It's a good game with a lot of nice ideas. Unfortunately it does not follow these ideas to the end. Some mechanics are only used or necessary in less than a handful of levels.It has a total of six chapters, my overall playtime was 6hrs with at least 1 hr of idling around (and in this time I got 100% achievements but not all card drops...). So, grab this game for some short fun for 10 €/$ or so. But unless workshop content is added for more complex / longer levels I'd rather not pay more."

This however, I am struggleing to see why everyone is giving it such praise.  It's repeated a few of the mistakes of early VR games, like having an over-abundance of identical items that literally serve no other purpose than to be picked up and rotated (the rotating system is completely unintuitive on the mouse btw), but it's a pretty game with an intirguing premise.   I do feel like they've missed plenty of opportunities to really make this immersive, for example - why no inteactive objects that you can pick up in these little hub sections?  No just endless beakers and test tubes, yawn.  Unfortunately the twist was given away pretty early-on in the game, in one of the easier of ever-more annoying bonus sections.  The puzzles can be pretty irritating, the amount of times I felt like I was bodging a puzzle was ridiculous, if you feel like your cheating when its actually a solution its a pretty unsatisfying experience and points to lazy puzzle building IMO.  There are far too many timing orientated ones which I neither find challenging or enjoyable, just frigging repetitive, and the biggest sin for me was when at one point you were required to run at a cube in order to ""kick"" it off of a ledge - couldn't they just have a throw feature for crying out loud?? I ended up checking the walkthrough as I had done before for when I felt like I wasn't REALLY solving it, and in every instance that I did, that was the correct solution.  Speaking of throwing; there's a section early on where you just drop a box through a window and the AI (Tom) later references you ""throwing"" the box, prompting me to shout - No I ""f#*king didn't, you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥wouldn't let me!"" - goddamit game why cant I throw?You have 7 areas with 10 puzzle sections each seperated by some hubs with 2 or 3 story items to investigate, whilst the bonus sections are the only other areas with ANY plot elements but are interspered between puzzle sections.  These are primarily in written form, which take forever to read as some of them are handwritten and render poorly in game (you have to tilt them to get the right angle for the text to sharpen properly), why they couldn't have a read option to display the text properly I have no idea.  There's a similar problem with the crews recordings, the audio quality is absolutely terrible - it's like listening to a cassette tape from the 80's that's been copied 3 times; the russian character especially is frequently impossible to understand with his is accent adding to the problem.  And surprise surprise headphone make FA difference.  You may suggest subtitles?  I had enabled them before starting the game and whilst the in-game dialogue with the AI and other characters are subtitled, none of the audio recordings are - that's pretty f#*king stupid!  The voice acting of the two main characters is very good, this can't be said for some of the recordings you find though - hammy is the word.With reagrds to the ending, I have no idea what the alternate ending is as I seriously cannot be bothered to find out, thats how uninterested I am in this game.  I'm a bit OCD when it comes to seeing everything in a game but this - I was happy to quit (or ctrl tab as the game forces you to watch the credits - I wish devs would stop doing that already).  I would quite happily sell this half price to anyone interested as I'd rather not have it in my library; it offends me that much.  I think this is because it gets so much right but then falls over on the more basic stuff, meaning that you feel like the exerience is constantly interrupted cos you can't beeleive some one let that go.  I just dont feel like the QC has been done here compared to its predessors like Portal.  The comparisions to portal are not justified in my opinion, the quality simply isn't there, plus I never felt like I was bodging there -  I always felt like I was actually progressing and wanted to keep playing whilst this was the exact opposite experience.  Portals mechanics worked better and when you jumped, you jumped whereas ""Ava"" hops, maybe 3 inches?  No seriously measure it ingame on a wall tile - its laughable, so there's areas where even a child could jump and climb on to and yet there you are moving three inches.  If this has something to do with the gravity on planet, it would seriously help immersion to TELL US THIS duing the prologue.  There's a similar problem with crouch, you literally duck like 3 inches, I get that I'm in a space suit but considering we're in a world so technically advanced that we've landed on and began mining Europa, I can't believe that space suits would be that cumbersome that far into the future.  Therefore whenever you are faced with a puzzle it just bugs the crap out of you that this is actually far simplar to solve, the game just prevents you from doing the most obvious things cos the designers were to lazy to make some actually challenging puzzles.  There is a section involving logic switches too which I think is a bit unfair, if your relying on a person to have specific knowledge that you're not providing in game, then thats poor game design.  Instead you are forcing the player to complete via trial and error which again isn't solving anything - its like a hacker brute forcing their way past a password screen, BORING and monotenous!Then there were the bugs, eurgh!  For such a short game there are far too many of them and they made me end the game via task manager on 8 or 9 occassions!   The first problem I had was the bloom, my god it's everywhere and far too bright and obscures far too much on several occassions it actually prevented me from seeing a very obvious solution to a puzzle; turn off bloom you say? Well fine, except there's no option to do that in-game, I could disable it via nvidea but considering how short the game is I didn' feel that farting about in the conteol panel particularly worth my time.  On other ocassions the light would suddenly dip in an area and you'd barely be able to see, which disorientated me on a number of occassions and on one occassion - a timing puzzle - that almost caused me to rage quit.   I also had issues with my dual monitor setup, basically I like to have some background noise whilst I'm playing games like this, so I often whack youtube on or something on my second monitor; 4 times the game randomly decided to switch to my other monitor and would not move back forcing a restart.  The wierdest thing about this is that the resolution would shoot up to like epic proportions, it was like the game thought my monitor was like a home cinema tv, you could literally just fit the word chapter (from the top right of the pause menu) on the screen, pretty nuts!Now I did get this in the sale but I still cant recommend it, the concept is interesting but they nefd that with the bonus sections.  During on bonus section I was nosing through one of the walkthroughs when faced with what felt like a bodged solution, someone said that the some of the bonus sections are explained later via certain diagrams, etc; meaning you will have to replay to get all the content.  The moment I heard that I thought - ""no ♥♥♥♥ing way am I playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥again!""  And promptly opened the walkthrough the minute I couldn't be arsed with them - they can be quite tedious at times and the payoff is pretty poor.  During the last one  - possibly the easiest puzzle in the game - it seems like the devs were over compensating for not having more story items in larger areas (like the lab etc) previously and proceeded to give you about 10 sheets of A4 text to read.  As interested as I am in AI, reading 10 pages in one go was again, irritating, especially when considering these desperately needed to be scattered throughout the game to break up the puzzle section and as a reward."

Around chapters 6 and 7 some of the tests become a bit more difficult since you have to control several entities to solve them. The most challenging are the optional puzzles, but event those are fairly straight forward. The most difficult optional test is one that requires you to solve a number of logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, and negated inputs), but with a background in electronics even that puzzle was pretty straight forward.All in all, the story is good and the graphics are nice (even though the DX12 version felt much more sluggish and gave me huge frame drops on a GTX1080ti and 7700K, so I stuck to the DX11 version since I couldn't see any difference anyway), and the game is a pleasant experience. Only the puzzles could have been a bit more difficult and more diverse.If you're into first person puzzle games that are ranked somewhere between a pure walking sim and the nail-bitingly difficult Talos Principle, The Turing Test is just about the right game for you.First play-through without looking up any of the puzzles on the internet took me about 5.5 hours, so it's not exactly a long game."

Later in the game you and the AI, TOM, team up to push through tasks.With an AI giving you the inside scoop and guiding you, you learn what the Turing Test is and what happened to the crew. As the story unfolds you learn things are not quite as they seem on Europa and as soon as you get another little piece of information at the beginning of each level you feel wanting for more but facing the realization you have to beat that level to learn more!

They get more difficult during the game but only to a certain point.If you're experienced in these kind of games, it might be a bit too easy. I'd say it's a little bit easier than the Portal games. Still, the gameplay was very fun for me.The story seems kind of generic in the beginning. You wake up alone in a space station above Europa, one of the Jupiter moons. You're sent to it's surface to investigate where the rest of your crew is. While doing so, you're accompanied by an A.I. voice, similar to Glados or Elohim (from The Talos Principle).After starting of kind of bland, the story develops into something very interesting, especially after a huge plot twist which I don't want to spoil. Also, I definitely recommend trying to solve the restricted areas in the first playthrough.It took me 6.6 hours to complete the story and the secrets . As I don't really like overly long games, I'm very content with this.The game runs on Unreal Engine 4. The graphics are definitely up-to-date and look really nice and polished. The game is locked to 60 fps but can be unlocked via console or config.The performance is actually very nice. Most of the time, the game runs very smooth and had no noticable fps drops. Though, sometimes some stuttering occured and I experienced three game crashes (mostly when going into new sectors). To be fair, I ran the game from an external hard drive. I played on DX12 with a GTX1080 and between 180 and 240 fps.I had some problems with the mouse settings as I couldn't put the slider low enough to get a comfortable sensitivity.

Don't be discouraged if at first it seems a bit too easy just give it a chance.Saying anything about the story would spoil it. It's a sci fi game, it's a sci fi plot. Take that as a pro or a con.I do have a couple of gripes with the game as some details of the plot are found early in the game if you look around trying to piece the story together and end up feeling ""No Duh!"" for the player but not to the character because, even if we read those things through her, she is not reacting to the new audio or text. This comes off as very odd given that the whole experience looks like it was carefully put together.All in all, the game is a great challenge for puzzle lovers who want to give their lateral thinking skills a slap in the face and the story makes you go ""Hmmm I hadn't thought about it that way"".Oh right, the story might make you feel shocked or conflicted and somewhat uneasy pfff.... feelings are overrated just do whatever it takes to solve the puzzzle, just chop off your arm and leave it on top of the plate I would do it because it's the logical thing to do.What?

,Recommended,499520,33447728,Posted: 10 July,all,Nebulous Idea,"So in the land of sci-fi first person puzzler games with an omnipotent voice throughout your journey, where does this one stand? TL;DR at the bottomFirst and foremost, this game has an incredibly annoying fullscreen bug where it constantly moves itself to windowed mode every time it hits a loading screen or you apply changes to the settings. I never found a fix and found nobody else reported this issue. Maybe it's from two monitors, maybe it's putting the game in 1080p on a 4K screen, I don't know. It negatively affected my experience nonetheless. The workaround was to press ALT + Enter until it went back to fullscreen every single time it decided to window itself.Right off the bat know that this game is not hard. The one single time I got stuck was on the last puzzle of the game, and it was a great feeling to complete it. There are no other moments like this, every puzzle can either be breezed through or unintentionally solved, save for the last one. A handful of puzzles seem like they either have multiple solutions or like you solved them incorrectly in the way that it seems like they go too quickly.So the puzzles are a bit of a wash but what about the story? I found the story to be excellent. This really is a game that makes you think, especially when it starts asking hard-hitting questions. It also helps that this game doesn't follow standard story format, in that predicting the end is very difficult; the problem in this is a problem with an unclear solution.Another thing I want to mention is the poor audio mixing and the surprisingly poor voice acting quality. Some voices blow your ears out from their ridiculous volume, others you can barely hear; this occurs even when the two vastly different volumes are talking to each other. Very irritating. The voice acting quality on a few of the characters is surprisingly bad, it seems like they got random people on the dev team to voice people isntead of someone who knows how to sound convincing.TL;DR as to where this stands in the sci-fi first person puzzler genre (IN MY OPINION): Portal > Talos Principle >The Turing Test> Antichamber > Q.U.B.E. > Quantum ConundrumThe main negatives I have are technical problems and a lack of difficulty, but I find everything else to be great."

Read as: Do not use Portal as standard or comparison. Turing Test has a different concept and the similarities are more atmospheric / visually (player has to solve mostly white puzzle rooms with a handheld device while communicating with a P.A.). Of course the puzzle mechanic is different to Portal, but most importantly: The whole theme and atmosphere is way different. Especially compared to Portal, it's more serious.It is quite short (i've finished it in 7h including all achievements and audio logs) and most puzzles feel a bit too easy, but i was still very satisfied.My major points of criticism are:-Pacing/Dialogue flow: The dialogue feels weird. For example: You enter room 1 and exchange 3 or 4 lines. When you enter room 2, the dialogue is picked up for another few lines, and so on. It just feels like one large dialogue per chapter, but chopped up. And if you need a bit longer for some room, the break feels weird.-Variance of difficulty: The majority of rooms feels slightly too easy and some rooms in between suddenly too hard / too complex."

The devs added a ton of philosophical debates between the AI and the characters, so it really made you question your own logic about awareness. Can't say too much about the story without spoilers. There are at least three endings that I was able to find, not sure if there are more. The bonus puzzle rooms are worth solving because they are somewhat more challenging than the required rooms, but they lead to little tidbits of dialogue and other story-enhancing material once you solve them.Not much else I can say that hasn't already been said by others.

Turing Test does have it's own set of unique mechanics but they aren't as complex when you get the hang of them.That said, it does manage to hit that magic sweet spot of offering just enough challenge without ever becoming frustrating.  There were a few puzzles I pulled a walkthrough for, mostly for lack of player knowledge or laziness, since I was more engaged with moving forward and finding more of the story.And that's really where the Turing Test for me shines.  It's got just enough of heady material and plot to keep you engaged until the end.  It's also short enough that there really is no reason not to finish it.  I was able to 100% it in under 6 hours.The graphics are great and the story is compelling, even if you see the major plot points coming.Unfortuantly the game also has no replayability, and many are turned off because of want for more challenge.Think of Turing Test more like an interactive movie akin to Inception or Memento and you're more on target for how you should weigh your dollars and price vs. entertainment.Overall I really loved it, would highly recommend on discount."

They kind of look like portal puzzles because you have to move different blocks and you have a gun. It doesn't create portals, it collects energy cells, which basically do the same thing. These are only tools available to you. 90% of puzzles arenot very challenging, other 10% is pure guessing, which I didn't like because you can't solve them logically. A story is great. In the middle of the game, I cared about the story more than about puzzles. The only bad thing I found about the story is that I figured out what will happen.Also, another thing I liked about gameplay, you can interact with almost everything you see. It's not useful most of the times but it's a cool thing to have. You can take a random piece of an interior, literally pick it up and rotate it as you want to.  Finally, inthis game if you stand on a platform and it moves too fast, your character falls a bit, which looks like you bugged into the texture, however, it's not the case. I don't really know why it's like this but it is.I think it's a great game to get as you don't need to be good at puzzle-solving to enjoy it.

There are aspects which I thoroughly enjoyed, but it fell short of reaching its potential. Let's start with......Cons- Too short. There are lost of puzzles but many of them can be solved relatively quickly so what seems to be a longish game really isn't.- Too many simple puzzles. Whenever they introduce a new element you go through a few puzzles that teach that element to you. Fair enough, but this teaching period goes for too long. No more than two puzzles are needed to teach a mechanic.- It *almost* said something interesting about free will. Scripts needed more fleshing out, more discussion, more... more.Pros- Art and lighting are spot on.- While there were some ovrly simple puzzles- the last five were astonishingly easy to solve when they should have been incredibly difficult- I did have fun solving a large number of them.- Voice acting is well done, so good marks for the actors and director.There's one thing that could make the game *much* better.Community. Maps.It will extend the life of the game immensely and give the fans a chance to create the devilishly difficult maps that they really wanted out of this game but didn't get. It is one improvement that shouldn't take a huge amount of time to program but will make the appeal of the game much greater than it currently has. It worked for Portal 2, and it should work for Turing Test. If the editor is relatively simple to use I would be tempted to throw a few maps together."

All the story is spoonfed to the player, the secret areas contain the interesting bits about philosophy but have almost nothing to do with the actual story.All the characters have no personality and just shout their opinions over and over without making good arguments (except the AI T.O.M. who actually bothers to provide arguments).Also there are many inconsistencies and holes in the story which overall is very upsetting especially in this type of game.Conclusion: if you can get this game on sale it will get you 5 hours of good puzzling, but thats all.

It's too late after Portal, Antichamber, etc. to really capitalise on that, and its lack of VR capability means it doesn't capture a market it's perfect for. Yet as a product taken out of context, it's still a very good title that doesn't outstay its welcome.As a puzzle game, its puzzles are perhaps the most important aspect. There's only one puzzle you can't do at first (it's an optional one), although you could guess your way to the answer if you had the patience, but generally the puzzles are all pretty easy. There's one or two that require a bit more thought or bending of the rules, though I don't think most players will struggle with it at all.The other main aspect of the game is its story, and I think this is where it excels. The story is really quite captivating and thought-provoking, and I felt like I was constantly trying to work out where it'd go or how it'd resolve itself, and it goes quite deep.

The learning curve is very gradual, and the game doesn't spoon-feed you on game mechanics, but rather teaches you through level design (which is great). I think that this is a first person puzzle/platforming game executed amazingly.The puzzles are very fun, albeit on the easy side, the narrative is great, and there are even easter eggs thrown in here and there. There are 70 different ""puzzles"", which at first sounds like a lot, but many of them go by very quickly (especially in the first few chapters where the game is simply teaching you game mechanics rather than giving you real puzzles).If you're a fan of first person (and to a much lesser extent platforming) puzzle games, then you'll enjoy this game. You need to decide for yourself if the price tag is worth it however, as I mentioned earlier, I bet 90% of people will spend 2-5 hours for the whole game regardless of how you go through it."
,Recommended,499520,30041653,Posted: 19 February,all,Siegen,"TL;DR: If you liked the puzzles in Portal and/or Talos Principle, you'll probably like the puzzles here.--I'll be saying nothing new to note that this game is essentially Portal and Talos rolled together. It takes the ""gun"" mechanic and indoor environments from portal and the philosophy and energy mechanics from Talos. However, it didn't have any of the personality of Portal or quite live up to the rigor or Talos.In fact, it took something I didn't like from Talos: weak philosophical writing. Without getting into spoilers, the game takes place on one of Jupiter's moons where a small team of highly select scientists are sent to look for life. Unfortunately, the space agency didn't perform any psychological screening or training and, despite at least two of the scientists being labeled ""exobiologists"", didn't ask if the crew had a really narrow, closed-minded view of what life is. This is the same problem I had with the remake of Battlestar Galactica. The writers manufactured drama by making the characters extremely intractable about how robots can't think. At least the BSG characters had the excuse of imminent extinction. The characters in Turing Test are just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥What the game does right, though, it does very right. The art team is clearly very talented. Models and animations are all great and the engine is put to good use. The sound design and music is also great. The voice actor for TOM (the AI) is superb (if not directed a bit too on-the-nose in some lines). As well, Sarah's VA does a great job conveying genuine emotion throughout.But again, the game falls prey to problems that stop it from being as good as the games it emulates. The acting is inconsistent between actors, with some being overly quiet or lacking emotional range. Some of the voice logs are mixed such that it becomes very difficult to hear what's said (and not just because that's what the developers intended).As far as the puzzles themselves, they range from very entertaining to downright lazy. Especially in the last chapter, some of the puzzles become meaninglessly easy, leading me to believe they just needed a few extra to make their progress indicator a perfect square. There are also a few times where I'm pretty sure I beat the puzzle via an exploit in the level's geometry or some other method that the developers didn't anticipate.Conversely, some of the puzzles are quite clever. I even physically laughed at one of the extra puzzles when I figured out the solution because of how silly and ingenious it was. However, none of the puzzles stumped me. I certainly never felt the kind of pressure or reward as I did playing Talos. I'm certain some people sat down and walked through the game in the span of a couple of hours.I imagine some of the controls will be either loved or hated by players. For instance, the control panels where you have to hold E and then move the mouse to move an object. It seems like it would have been far better to just have E be a toggle and then use WASD to move the object. I'm not sure how much of that may have been because of controls designed for a controller and backported to KB&M.--In the end, it was a worthwhile purchase for $10. For anyone that likes puzzle games, I'd certainly recommend it.If I had any advice for the developers, it'd be to reevaluate their writing. Games like this either need to not take themselves too seriously (since the mechanics of the game simply can't be justified as realistic), in the same way that Portal and Stanley Parable approached it, or they need to have something meaningful to add to the philosophical debate. Clumsy interactions between unlikable characters and a too-transparent AI founded on artificial tension between basic Humanist and Transhumanist ideas harms an otherwise enjoyable game."

The game does have harder, optional puzzles for those who want it and you'll get rewarded with more story. The optional puzzles are very well put together and I would highly recommend a new player to do them. There exists a puzzle that has you perform boolean logic that I thought was especially well executed.The story had enough going for it to keep me engaged to the very end, mostly due to the fantastic voiceacting.However, I do feel as though they could have done more with the concept and I feel that they should have leaned more on the philosophical aspect of it.Though it doesn't do what Portal and The Talos Priciple do better, it has it's charm and I think it's worth it's asking price."

I think the community could really make some interesting things.--SPOILERS BELOW----SPOILERS BELOW----SPOILERS BELOW--I thought the Epilogue [ending] seemed a bit... rushed? perhaps? I was expecting more a battle between T.O.M. - either fighting it out as TOM tries to lock you out, or more of a mental fighting - Eva slowly trying to reverse the control - exerting influence over T.O.M., instead of T.O.M. over her (as Sarah continually mentioned 'You have to try and control him!').Beyond that, to the end, I had harbored a suspicion that Eva was actually an AI herself, and that the 'Turing tests' we went through in the game, as well as ''the game'' itself had two objectives - the first, a basic test - can this 'AI' think laterally, while also thinking 'effectively' (as opposed to T.O.M. at one point, when Eva asks for help, he suggests she cut off her arm to weigh down the pressure pad - not a very good solution, eh?).But additionally, with the dialogue of the crew, T.O.M.s attempts at control, ect, I theorized that this was the second objective of this Matrix-like environment (assuming the entire 'world' we see is a simulation of some kind) - to see how this lateral-thinking AI responds to the ideas of free will, of human independence - would this AI go with the 'logical' thought that, obviously, total enslavement to a machine would make for a much more ''productive'' and ''efficient'' society - it's just ''logical'' - or would this new AI see value in the exercising of free will, of chaotic choice, that humans have?To be honest, I could entirely see a addendum to the story that had 'Eva' actually waking up to find that we are actually an AI being tested to see if we would support human free will, or always make the ''logical'' choice, even if it is morally and ethically shaky."

The puzzles up until the end were far from the most difficult puzzles possible, but it never stopped feeling like Portal in the way that it introduced elements and didn't entirely hold your hand through it. If there's one downside to this element, it's that it is possible that someone wouldn't figure out there is a socket on the back of the mobile robots without looking up a guide or getting lucky and spotting it.My playthrough lasted around 3-4 hours the first time through, and while entertaining, there isn't much replayability for it. That is more a problem with the puzzle genre, rather than this game, so I cannot mark it off for that specifically. However the story, while playing on an old storyline, added a very nice twist at the end, and kept me engrossed throughout the entire playthrough.Pros: Rich story, good voice acting, pleasant graphics, plot twist, and free of any real bugsCons: Fairly short game, no replayability, puzzles do get a little repetative, but nothing too major.All in all, I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone that can't get enough puzzle games like myself, but to anyone that is on the fence about it, I would suggest waiting until it is on sale as $20USD is a little steep for a 3-4 hour (your mileage may differ) experience."

The ambient music and voice acting are very good. When I first stated playing, The default settings gave me motion sickness and had to put this title aside for a bit. Checking the discussion pages showed that others had the same issues. I did find a solution (Field of View to maximum, Mouse sensitivity to minimum, Motion blur off, tweaking the quality until I could keep the FPS at 60). It helps that I have a GTX 970M graphics card on my laptop. I stongly recommend doing this before you get started (it would even help if the mouse sensitivity could be further dropped).The first two chapters are very easy, teaching the player how to get used to the game world (similar to the first 10 levels of the original Portal). Then the difficulty ramps up and the fun begins. There are a total of 70ish levels, and many more interactable items than Portal 2 (i.e. light-bridge). Had to peek at the discussions for a hint on a chapter 4 and 5 puzzle, the others I eventually got on my own.Some of the puzzles involve time-dependent actions, maybe more-so than in Portal 2.Bought this on sale, I'd even pay full price for this.

The visual style and the potential of the nearly brand-new Unreal 4 Engine as well as the setting of being stranded on the Jupiter's moon Europa against an evil AI drew my immediate attention, as I was browsing through the Steam's midweek sales. Sadly, this game fell a bit too short in order to achieve satisfactory level gameplay for one, who previously has played through a couple of puzzle games, and there were a few reasons for this.The first, and frankly the most important thing in a puzzle game, is of course, the level design, which was a slight disappointment. It was obvious, what the developers were thinking about with the puzzles of this game: they encourage the player to think outside the box and utilize whatever items there were in the Turing Test Chambers. The levels were creative and versatile with enough variety to keep the player going. Unfortunately, after playing both Portals this game could not offer enough challenge with its puzzles, because these were quite similar to Valve's titles and easy enough to sprint through in a matter of hours.The second thing was the plot, which for a sci-fi fanatic, seemed rather interesting at a first glance. However, the way it was implemented to the world of the game, felt like it had been seen already. Without spoiling anything, I would just say that I wished more. The lore was there, and the characters were extremely fascinating, especially the relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist, but there was not enough gameplay time to affect the outcome of the game, and most of the big events felt like you were going on rails.Both of the previously mentioned aspects let me play the game in a total amount of five-odd hours, including nearly all of the secrets and every single achievement in the entire game. If you are someone, who is fascinated by the AI-controlled future in the style of the 2001: A Space Odyssey, I would suggest that you would wait for a bargain.

And it's actually here where I believe The Turing Test triumphs Portal. During the game, through the documents and audio logs, we find the land crew's side of the story. And through the conversations Ava and T.O.M. have, we are given his side of the story, and he tries to explain to us through logic, tht he did no wrong. In this, T.O.M. feels a lot like V.I.C.K.Y., from I Robot.While in Portal (at least the first, I haven't played Portal 2), I feel we are never given a reason of why GLADOS behaves in the way she does, she's just a murdering lying robot (don't get me wrong, she's awesome, but seems to have no reasons to be like she is, other than something going awfully wrong with her programming).Totally recomended for those who, like me, enjoy overthinking stuff."

The puzzles do gradually get more and more complex and challenging as the game progresses (as you would expect), with new gameplay elements being introduced regularly to keep challenges fresh. I wouldn't describe any of the puzzles as particularly challenging however, and only the last one provided more than a few minutes of difficulty.Story-wise, I'd describe the plot as 'sufficient', but there was a lot more potential there than was actually explored. The ending felt a little abrupt and unsatisfying, though this didn't stop the puzzles from being fun, and there was at least enough plot to tie together what the character is required to do.Graphically the game looks pretty good, though some physical elements within the game could do with a little bit of a physics adjustment, but that's a very minor detail.All told I enjoyed playing through The Turing Test, and if you enjoyed the aforementioned games you'll probably like this too."

Excellent concept for logical minded people.The graphics are fantastic; the music and audio flow perfectly through the game; the controls ASDWE move you easily through the areas; and the story is compelling and has conjured up many discussions in the intellectual community.I have to admit that TOM reminded me of the HAL 9000 and the association only enhanced the emotional part of the experience.It took me over 17 hours to get through the quest.

I like it when there is multi-layer puzzles that give you similtanious puzzles or challenges in one. Also, I don't like how there isn't skill based puzzles such as the ones in portal. No timing needed or platform jumping.I feel the same way about the story. As others have stated,it follows a linear path with an obvious ending. No big final challange or boss.Pure disapointment for me at the end. It wasn't like movies that leave you hanging for a reason; it just feels unfinished. Maybe they will include that if they make a sequal but otherwise it is not satisfying or rewarding.Only buy this game if you are new to puzzle games and/or want an easy challenge for chill sessions.

The real difficulty in most of the tests is discovering the hidden lock or what all of the pieces of equipment do. Once you figure out how the gizmo works, you can usually solve the puzzle pretty fast (although there were 2 or three that really had me stuck for a little while). Visually it looks fine. Replayability is next to zero unless you like doing speed runs.OVERALLThe puzzles could stand to be a bit more difficult, but it has a fantastic story and some interesting moral/ethical/philosophical questions.

Everything about the game had a very portal-esque feel. I was prepared for a complete rehash. You wake up in a testing facility, receive a gun-like tool to use in solving puzzles, and start moving boxes onto buttons to complete tasks.However, after the first few puzzles the game rapidly diversified. Showing just how unique and flexible its puzzle system was. The game does an excellent job of introducing a wide variety of mechanics in the puzzles, introducing them one by one in a very natural way such that the player can just keep progressing and progressing without having to stop for tutorials or other interruptions. The story continues to get more and more interesting.As someone with a deep interest in the philosophy behind the nature of intelligence, and the ramifications of “true” AI, the story began to grip my attention very quickly. The “bonus rooms” start to tell a compelling story-within-the-story that kept me seeking out and solving them. Even without that aspect, the primary story tells an interesting tale of rationality vs emotion, the needs of the few vs the needs of the many, and other such themes. The writers did an excellent job crafting an engaging and unique tale.The game is short, I managed to 100% it in only two play sessions, but it is definitely a game worth playing."

The main problem is that neither is great. Both Portal and Talos Principle are better games, so this sits in an awkward place. There are 70 puzzle rooms to complete. Some are super easy, others not. I'd gladly trade these 70 rooms for 35 of higher quality.There are a few annoying problems beyond that.1. The game boasts ""full controller support"" but literally the very first thing you need to do is dig out your mouse and keybaord and click on Accept to install some Unreal Engine 4 stuff. I'm playing this on my couch with a controller, so that was an annoying start.2. The game has subtitles but they're very tiny and hard to read, and there's no way to adjust the size.

Anyone expecting another ""The Witness"" or ""The Talos Principle"" might be a little disappointed at its relative lack of depth but The Turing Test is never boring and its short length means that it doesn't outstay its welcome. I liked it :)"

,Recommended,499520,35472425,Posted: 4 October,all,Panda Tar,"The Turing Test is ... I'm not really sure if I should recommend the game or not. If you have played Portal games or even The Talos Principle (or read/watched ""I, Robot""), you'll find this game rather shallow, a wannabe of sorts, and I would point you out to get this only if you really wouldn't mind much of its lack of depth for a good sale ordinance, perhaps 50-75%.The game presents you with your character who's going about the station, trying to figure out what happened with everyone else, and meanwhile you are guided by an AI. And that's all you have to know and guess about the rest of the game. There's this small mysterious vibe here and there, but deep down, you know what that's all about.So, it's a light game, rather short in both gameplay and interest, that I would recommend only if you get it on sale – and if you haven't gotten Portal or Talos Principle, you might enjoy it a bit more, given you would not have anything blatantly superior as a comparison."

It certainly doesn't have the wit of Portal or the depth of The Talos Principle, but it's still a great in its own right. These comparisons shouldn't discourage you from playing The Turing Test. Rather, it's just a testament to how good those other first-person puzzle games are."
