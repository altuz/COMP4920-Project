,Recommended,499620,31991193,Posted: 27 May,all,King Grimroc,"This is one of the VR titles that makes me wish games like Planet Coaster (or hell, even RollerCoaster Tycoon World, as bad as it is) NEED to support VR.You ever get that sick intense feeling of being suspended high up and whipped around when riding an extreme theme park ride? Well, this is pretty much the same intense feeling mixed with a tad bit of nausea that you would expect. Now the nausea in my case is from a sense of vertigo. Fully welcomed in this case since it is also mixed with a strong dose of excitement sorely missed from days gone by spending my youth at various theme parks. Something I do not get to do these days anymore due to location.In any case, this is an excellent showcase of just what VR can do to your  mind. I love it! Small doses on this one though, unless you want to leave your lunch on the floor. And for this title, I fully suggest sitting down, or if you're standing, try to have a spotter to keep you from falling over.Anyway. Thumbs up. All that jazz. Worth the $5."

Sitting on a chair is less intense.In fact it is the perfect way to put your mother in law to hospital. Give her a ride and she will for sure fall over and knock her head.Frankly, this is dangerous. I had to go to my knees twice in order not to fall. I have not experienced motion sickness though. But I played only for a short time yet.The bottom line is that this is definitely the best way to show people what VR is. The graphics are less than great but still this demo rocks you off the shoes.

Don't make your mind up on the fact that people can/will get motion sickness....Hello McFly! Look at the name of the title ....sheesh.  I purchased when there was only the 2 rides and thought it was well worth the money then,  I mean come on, it's a thrill ride that you can always ride without waiting in line...unless your letting others try also, then your waiting.  Yes, the feeling of motion is fantastic and if you can't handle these types of sensations in the real world, that is..if you would toss your cookies at the county fair if this ride were there, chances are your gonna want to put down some plastic in your play area.  Great job developer, keep the rides and experiences comming and I'll keep moping up the floor afterwards...love it!"
,Recommended,499620,26509348,"Posted: 9 November, 2016",all,Syrsly,"The November 9, 2016 review: Great ride!Even on my very modest, not-so-vr-ready rig, this is a fairly lag-free experience.  For $5 normal price, it's a great demoing app at the least. I use it to introduce friends to seated position VR.  It's not really a standing position kind of game, though.  It's about sitting in a ride, so you better expect to stay seated the whole time.  It's a lot of fun for about 10 minutes per person, per ride/scene (currently 2 rides/scenes to choose from), and I will be replaying it every now and then as a nice thrill ride.The Updated review: Great rides!The overall update was a success.  I loved the new menu design (similar toKeep Defending), though I would have liked a reset button for the various levels/modes.  It's not perfect, but it's a great VR experience if you can deal with a few headaches.The rocket works with a few drawbacks.With a little more optimization and slightly less limited boost time, the rocket experience could be a lot more fun.  The current problems with the rocket experience include a very limited boost, slow base rocket speed, and a small cityscape that takes next to no time to explore.  The hunt for the billboards was fueled only by seeing the new achievement for it, but it was fun for a couple minutes to hunt those down regardless of why.  I would like to see more gamification in the rocket mode but it should retain the ability to be a relaxing rocket ride... as funny as that sounds.Rocket experience tips!The immersion kind of takes a step back with this ride, because you control the rocket's speed and direction with only one controller.  To improve the immersion, you may want to sit in a turnable roller chair and have the Vive's cords fed up to the ceiling to give yourself more mobility.  This can be done on the cheap by using adhesive hooks.  Then, place your arms on the arms of the chair.  Leaning forward without moving your arms from the chair's arms and at the same time, tilting the controller using only your wrist will make it seem like you're actually tilting on the rocket.  Turning the chair to turn the rocket will reduce the potential for motion sickness.The bungie jump is a great distraction but......it's simpler than the original rides and the rocket mode.  It may not hold your attention for long in its current state, but it's a cool thing to experience, anyway.  The bungie jump experience is probably better suited to a standing position rather than a seated position, because it makes more use of the roomscale play area.  You are intended to calibrate the play area so you line up enough empty space in front of you to walk/run/roll/slide yourself off the edge of a beam held high above a cityscape.  This introduced my wife and I to a little confusion at first, because we were expecting rides which were a little less interactive and a little more initiated from a seated position.  That said, we appreciate the new game mode and love the new achievements for it.  One such achievement is to grab the bottle from the crate on the ground at the end of the bungie jump.  That bottle seems impossible to grab, though.  I still can't get it.Overall, Ultimate Booster Experience is well worth the $5."

I've given three such persons a taste of this thing, and joined my other friends in laughing our faces off as the rooster becomes the chicken. Good stuff. Also, if you're a thrill seeker, pretty intense stuff! I hope they make an entire amusment park someday.7/10 - Good, but not really a game. You ride once, scream a bunch, and swear you'll never ride it again."

,Not Recommended,499620,29532901,Posted: 27 January,all,MechGorilla,"This 'game' is absolute crap. The graphics are crap, and it gives you an instant headache. You can fly around on a rocket but it barely feels like a rocket, and you can fly through buildings. I flew into the ground and was instantly teleported into the sky. Crap. My hands bounced around erratically, and the first time I sat on the rocket... well, it looks more like a rocket protruded from my chest like some insane Manga character... the controls didn't work. I had to re-select it and then they did. I hate that there is so much shovelware coming out for VR - you wouldn't stand for it with your new console, so why are we being inundated with amateurish♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by everyone with a personal copy of Unity and accepting it? I hate this game. I have never asked for a refund, but I'm fed up with this... I'll make this my first."

However, the graphics really arent too great, especially for a paid experience like this. On top of that, for me, motion sickness kicked in pretty quickly. This is the first time a VR game has genuinely made me feel motion sick. I really can't recommend buying this game. Perhaps if it were free."

It's never been a problem with me, even when I am viewing other roller coaster rides.It's decently priced compared to other vr games, but not for what you get. A dollar would have been a more appropriate price for this."
