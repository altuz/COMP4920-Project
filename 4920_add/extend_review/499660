As its a unique formula that seems to be working on early access, i highly recommend spenind £14 on this title.You wont be disappointed!"
,Recommended,499660,32310062,Posted: 9 June,all,VALIS,"Tremendous potential here, but it appears pretty early on given its 0.11 version number and the estimated 10-12 months to completion. The art assets are of a high quality for a sub-$20 game, and the voice acting and music seem rather good as well. Of course, being early Early Access, there are little bugs and glitches all over the place. Unit pathing is rough, the tutorial isn't fleshed out, small graphical glitches here and there, and there's no campaign yet. Standard stuff for Early Access.But what potential! Taking inspiration from Age of Empires, Battle for Middle Earth, historical Total War, and Stronghold, it has a little something for all types of strategy gamers. It also offers two features very important to me in an RTS: high camera zoom out and WASD camera control. With good progress this could become a big new player on the real time strategy scene. Already the activity around this game seems quite high for an Early Access RTS with no fanfare. I plan on playing it for another hour or two and putting it on the shelf for a while to check back in a few months. Here's hoping it becomes something great. The foundation is there, it just needs a lot of polish (and a campaign)."

And I have to say I enjoy it. Sure there are a few bugs here and there but the developers are actively working on sorting out majority of them .  And not to mention they are active on the steam forums !I do have to admit the first time I did try it I got smacked by the AI and I was not enjoying it at all. However after a few battles I adapted and actually started enjoying this game.So , is the game enjoyable in it's current state ? For me , yes it is. I see myself playing this game a lot when the weekend comes along and I'm off work...  I love how the map looks . The options in the battles , be it defending or attacking . The resource management is great.  And the difficulty level is amazing . You have to be ready for anything .Can the game improve ? Yes , some improvements are needed to the UI and the campaign map . More information regarding your army that gets deployed , some details about the AI army.  Make the AI actually defend during a defend battle instead of occasionally rushing all his troops to my base and catching me completely off guard and snapping my nuts off where I sit trying to build some resource buildings , funny stuff...:)As said they are still working on the game and it definitely does not deserve the negative reviews it has received at the moment. Looking forward to future updates and simply can't wait ! I will update this review as the updates comes along !For me the game is absolutely worth the money I paid for it."
,Recommended,499660,34204940,Posted: 12 August,all,Scottx125,"Since early access (EA) came out and a number of failed games I've invested in, I've become extremely dubious of any title carrying the EA badge. However Medieval Kingdom Wars has so far been the exception to this. I only played the game for a short while to give it a test, but the majority of implemented features worked perfectly fine and I encountered few bugs, and no game breaking bugs. The main reason why I am posting a positive review is not because of the game, whilst fine in it's current state it is of course nowhere near complete (however it has a lot of potential) and I would not recommend buying it YET unless you want to give this game a try yourself. However the openess of the developer in the steam discussion is something very rare with EA titles, and has been very willing to answer questions and respond to bug reports whilst also outlining the planned timeline for this games EA period. This is why I am bumping this as a yes so that you guys can keep it on your radar till more features come out, I will then most likely give it another test and do a final review of the game. For the moment you just keep this on your radar :)!"

Although it's still in early access it has a LOT of potential, and the devs are looking to release it in full-form in early 2018 so I am glad to support it. I am impressed by the art and the graphics in particular (they remind me of Paradox Studios, one of my favorite devs). I can't wait to experience the full release of the game - this scratches an itch for me that I haven't been able to itch since the release of Medieval Total War 2."

At least if you would like to support a great game in the making that ist. Don't jump into the game thinking It's the ultimate RTS Game right now, it hopefully will be in about a year, but for now keep in mind its EA, there still is a lot of content to add and a huge load of balancing and optimzation to be done.Right now it is a good opportunity for some skirmishes and a look at what it wants to be when it grows up. If you're not sure about buying it maybe wait a month to see if the devs add some nice content and to get a feeling on how fast the game will progress and wich way it will take.All in all you can watch the vids on the store page and if you would like the game discribed there to be made, buy it and support the development, enjoy some skirmishes and look forward to the campaign being added.I'm not a native english speaker but hopefully i still managed to get my point across."

There are a few things which are currently not so good such as the siege A.I from what I have seen is not able to make full use of siege towers and other siege equipment simply camping them infront of the walls - instead it seems to prefer using rams only. These minor problems with the game I know will be patched soon by the devs, I would reccomend the game now to people as I have recieved much enjoyment from this game. However, if you want to wait for a more complete experience then it may be a good idea to hold off till features such as campaign trade and diplomacy are fully implemented.I have made some videos showing the current skirmish mode of the game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1kIH7Bli04https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXfHAQDWY_4"

It offers fun real time battles and a real time campaign (the real time campaign is exactly what the total war series misses and what makes this title more interesting).

Gathering resources is a bit buggy (Trees & Stone)2. Some camera angles make it hard to view your troops3. Troops move a bit slow and path finding issues4. Movement on the world map could have better animations the player movements seem stiff and odd5. The graphics make it hard to see troops as they blend and combat needs more polishingAgain this is EA and the basic game play I find is fun and the blend of a few games make it really worth the money.Video Reviewhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw-1gj5DF4"

Of course it's got it's fair share of bugs and many of the options are not implemented yet, as you would expect from an Early Access title. The rate of improvement however is impressive, major updates, mini updates, and hotfixes are implemented at a rapid rate constantly improving the game.In the weeks that I have played it has improved in leaps and bounds on what it was and undoubtedly has the potential to become one of the greats of the genre. Whether it reaches those heights is down to the Devs ( who actually listen to what players say )and player support, which as far as I'm concerned it certaintly deserves. So if you are a fan of this type of game I have no hesitation in recommending this game and if you are new to the genre then it's a good place to start and watch it develop."

I like the visuals of cities and villages/ townes. Lay out of specific roles that serfs can play (loot bodies), thought that was pretty great. Morbid yes. Dark and gritty to match the time perfectly. Combat exists. Lots of blood. Some features are not fully implemented yet but are in the worlks, again has a good foundation. I'll be devouting a lot of playtime to this game.

You have to build an armycamp and siege/attack Citys and Villages to conquer them but simultanily you have to manage your Kingdom. Everything works in Real Time (which i'm a really big fan of) and i suspect it to get really challenging when your at more than one war and have to defend your Lands on more than one front.There are some bugs in the Games but i also have to say that Medieval : Kingdom Wars is one of the best working EA-Titles i bought and i'm really looking forward to see what the Dev's, with the help of the Community ofc, make out of that solid base.

I knew very little going into it, but was blown away by the attention to detail on historical accuracy. It is not often you see this in modern games.The world is immersive and huge. Whether I am viewing the regional map or down in the combat, it just feels as though the land and sea stretches out in all directions for miles. The amount of detail brings the world to life, even with all of the dying going on... City building only adds to the sheer size of it all!The combat is balanced, but challenging! Many past strategy games I've played never fulfilled a challenge once the game mechanics and AI capabilities were figured out, but MKW has challenged me to stay focused, otherwise it is easy to have victory slip away from you. It has supplied me with a challenge I find myself needing to attack a little more fiercely in my next session of play.The art is fantastic, no matter where it is placed in the game. The loading screens are very detailed, depicting scenes of battle or beautiful scenery, and the overall graphic design of the gameplay world is beautiful, even in the darkest, bloodiest trenches of war-torn lands.I've noticed a large amount of updates from the Devs, which is a great sign for any early release project! It means they really care about this project, and are improving this Early Access frequently! I'm excited to see what comes of it.Also... Is that a map editor I see? Now THAT I will be having a lot of fun with. When I was a kid, I used to purposely seek out games that had map editors so I could create my own worlds and scenarios. Map Editors are a dying breed, and I'm so happy the Devs included one in this early access!I'm looking forward to more updates and gameplay!"

I am a simple minded person when it comes to game though, and game play takes priority over graphics. The graphics, in my opinion are really good as well.  The devs do a fantastic job of bringing a seige warfare feeling to the game.  I can't recall any medieval RTS that ever made capturing a city be so in depth.  It feels like you are invested and there for the long haul.  It is EA, so not many features are present, but I hope they come soon. I understand EA means bugs, but for a price tag under 20 bucks, its worth the purchase."

The tutorial is pretty good and I've got very few complaints about the medieval feel of the game. The units all seem to have their own uses on the battlefield however, they are beyond incompetent. I mean, wow, braindead just doesn't do them enough justice. Your archery units will pepper the field with arrows, even the areas your melee units occupy, simple because a lone peasant made them feel threatened. They must be ancestors of policeman who claim the same. There doesn't seem to be a way for your units to target an enemy battalion as a whole, rather you have to right-click an individual enemy so gods help you if you miss and order your troops to march forward instead.Pathing is absolutely horrendous in cities. Countless times I've watched units walk brazenly through a burning section of road because they couldn't figure out how to follow a simple movement order two blocks over with clear line of sight. You'll wonder why a melee unit is getting hammered by arrows, only to find that half of the unit is slowly going around the corner of a building versus using the entire road available. On a side note, the sound design is not well balanced or controlled so prepare to have your ears blasted by a unit's dialogue despite the sound being at ""1"".All in all, these are simple early-access issues and can easily be fixed in future patches. I like the idea as a whole and intend to keep an eye on it and will change my review should these issues be ironed out."

,Not Recommended,499660,34297783,Posted: 16 August,all,Phrostylicious,"The game feels a bit like a re-made Stronghold and it seems that it could actually outdo the stronghold series if the devs make the right choices from now on. Even at this stage you can glimpse a gameplay that seems fairly balanced and challenging but the interface is the main reason, why I'm giving it a thumbs-down right now. Here are some reasons:1) No feedback when ordering your troops to do something; so you're never quite sure whether your troops are actually attacking as you want them to or not....2) Single clicking a unit seems(!) to be selecting all units of that type; even those off screen. It's clear how this is ridiculously annoying.3) You constantly see a bunch of crap flying through the air (siege ordnance, I'm guessing) but can never quite tell where it came from, where it impacted and whether the visual effects you're seeing are a glitch, or a shrapnell ammunition, or some impact animation.4) You can click-select stuff on screen that you can't interact with, i. e. trees. Stuff like this shouldn't be selectable if you can't do anything with it.5) Due to the lack of ANY feedback some menu actions are weird, for example the 'repair building' button. It says it ""toggles"" building repairs, but I think it should say ""starts building repairs when the building is no longer taking any damage"". At least that's how it seems to be working...6) When having a few archer units selected you must click on a single enemy person to attack; instead of being able to select an area or - as usually is the case in all other games - an enemy's SQUAD or UNIT. The fact that I have to right-click a single enemy person to attack feels absolutely silly and I'm not sure whether my selected archer units are truly all trying to hit that one, clicked guy, or whether they are just firing in 'the general direction of that one, clicked guy'...All in all the game has promise and I will check back with it in 6 months or so. The state it's in right now is not enjoyable to play for me."

But it could be if they keep updating and ading more of the game. I have put over 29 hours into the game and have taken whole Europe as Austria! It was a lot of awsome sieging and building. This can also be done via auto outcome. Which is great otherwise you would have to siege over 90 somewhat towns and castles... but you could  do that if your into that. just be prepared to lose a phew days of sleep. This game is hopefully nowhere near completion. Because at the moment you can not use the teach trea to learn new stuff. But you do get 12 buildings. Also a nice set of troops in many classes. So when we get to use everything i can see they have planned its going to be a complete good solid game! Now as for the building part and recourcing its good. The siege part how ever needs a lot of work. I find sometimes the units dont respond to command the dogs. Also the ai is not good enouph on your units and the enemy's units. Examples: blocking the gate entrance so no one can get in... or A.i does not shut his gate when i am about the siege with a massive army. So if your looking for a real challange then wait a bit til its complete. If you love medievel and grts games then come and support these guys. This is one of theses games you wil not forget and wel worth it.    And lastly you have at the moment campaign and skirmish for online with or againt A.I optional. I have not done that yet. I do hope tho they upgrade the online options. Because this game is going to be epic online.

It was thumb Down, but it affects overall reviews too much, what can generate a chain of bad things.....what is not good for both players and independent devs. Steam is not perfect engine to run crowdfunding, but its good for beta testing.I've decided not to refund game only, because its been kinda cheap, Cheap enough to not bother, and MKW show me loads of potential to be worthy child of very strange relation ship of 3 parents: Stronghold, Total War and Age of Empires. This is a good start. Specially that it focuses RTS aspect, which We, oldschool RTS kids, miss mostly these days.However, game is unplayable at this moment in very aspects for casual players. It may bring fun, dissapointment, promieses, and a blow of positive nostalgia for those who love Strategy games in common. Be ready to encounter lack of key content in some places, bugs, preformance issues, and DX9 graphics, which to be honest, are still lovely. Specially epic city design and surrounding fields.... Heroes 6 is Dx9 as well, ya know?Pros:- Attention to details on maps. Cities are ALIVE... peasants walking around, same appears to pigs and chickens. I love all this rubbish, barrels and crates scattered around ground. Building details are also amazing. Everything is detailed. Damn.- Fresh idea of mixing Grand strategy with RTS. Yes, we've seen this before. But we didnt seen it on such scale. Last time it was i think... Dawn of War - Soulstorm?  RTS on battles, Grand Strategy on Solar system map.- Historical accuarcy and attention to historical details.- I get hyped by this game. I dont usually get hyped.- Game kindly inform you its under development. One of dialog options started with ""Curse this Early Access(...)"" made me not to refund game after first 60 minutes.- Graphical engine seems to be mostly finished, same as Grand Campgain map, which is really detailed. Content is pain, optimisation as well. To be fixed.- Old British accent which i love. Its so fun to hear this. Voice actor need a cookie as reward.- RTS part feel like Age of Empires 3/battle of middle earth. Voice actoring and battles feel like Stronghold. Grand Strategy part on world map May feel like Total War.... when gonna be implemented.- I dont know why, but concept of grand capmgain at begining looks for me a little Mount&Blade.... starting with one town, small army... raise in ranks... Campgain may be a bit RPG-ish, that would be really nice!.- Confirmed future implementations of DX10/11 DDLs, which will make game look even more lovely. I mean, look at design of cities and lands... in DX9 it looks nice, with dx11 support it will flourish.-LEVEL EDITOR IMPLEMENTED IN EA. YAYAYAYAY~!!!!Cons:- and here we start, but before we will start, we arleady finished. However, its early access with short time being on such stage.- Cities as said, are great...but there is only 4 of them.It means they are done by hand, but still it means it will take time to have all 30.- Rest is procedurally generated, but without many variations so far. I think there should be improvements, because there is level editor with quite of options.- Skirmish is only available game mode for now. I mean, Playable one.- Campgain map is lovely detailed, but there is not too much to do over there, except some war and building up procedurally generated towns. it miss some deph for now. I hope in later stages there will be more to do.- I didnt get achievment for my tutorial. That sucks. I wanted that achievment.- Frames per Second are all over the place. Game runs between 20 and 60 FPS on 8 Core 3.5 ghz CPU, 8 GB of ram and r9 380. Optimisation sucks here so much, I dont need hookers. I could forgive it. I seriously could say ""ok its early access""... but.....-...but as said before, its DX9 engine.- Unit animations. This need to be really solved. Its only thing from graphics except dx9 what hurt eyes.Some general gameplay Cons:- Units pathfinding is quite nerfed. Serfs sometimes go some ♥♥♥♥ing away do ♥♥♥♥ all while rest of their humble servant couleges hardy choop wood. Lazy serfs. Also all units are quite not keen to go on towers or generally run. They like to ignore commands, what forceklick need to be implemented to get them moooving.- Unit colision. They quite colide on objects, but they create Stronghold-type human centipede thing.- General idea of creating another castle just at city's doorstep seems weird. It would do better as palisaded warcamp.if Devs gonna nerf/forgive and leave this project unfinished, i promise, i find my way to punish them.If you like RTS and Grand Strategy games, which here may cross with X4 type of games, you can back this project. Its not that expansive. If you're just casual player who like RTS, add this to observed games, even buy and ""keep for later"", and forget for now to dont feel unnecessary dissapointment from experiencing developing stage.General Rating: strong +6/10 for brave devs and great idea, but so far poor execution. Weekly updates should change thing later on. We gonna see, hoping for better future of conquering all those nice towns, and starving their pixelated citizens."

I've seen ideas where they like it but the scope of work is far greater or is a feature that would be on lower priority was released down the road.Gameplay is funTown buildingTotal War style fights with a good range of unitsUpdates frequently (at least once a week thus far)ConsIts still in the earliest stages of developementLacks finese of modern titles (AI rework occurring ~August, much content to be added, some models are too big so hard to select units that are too close during combat, lacking some basic features like ""A"" from starcraft so that units can attack as they come across enemies, etc)Graphics aren't the best - if that matters to youNo free form building, game uses predesignated  plots to balance attacking force camp and hamlets/castles (was a different concept for myself but works out IMO)Lack of trading/alliances currently (Potentially added in later content updates)No low level API's in use (DX12, Vulkan, etc.  Next title please? :D )ConclusionIf you're not into RTS/TOtal War, don't get this game.  If you don't like games that lack the finese of AAA titles, might not be the game for you.  But if you're like me and love finding diamonds in the rough, I'd say give this game 1 hour and 59 minutes of your time to see if you like it."

I'd like focus on the crusades and having the pope being a key character, excommunication, granting gifts etc. I would also like the King to be a key character, offering rewards e.g. units, resources and gold in return for missions, these can be optional as you may wish to defect to another lord or make a name for yourself.   I'd like more options (and extra options too) e.g. choosing what settlements I own at start, what enemies and what they have.  Naming characters and settlements and not just my own) maybe other religion options.  Treasures to hunt that offer trade, morale, wealth, espionage, unit experience boosts etc which all in game characters search for.

(You pretty much have to go to war)HOWEVER, I CAN IMAGINE MOST OF THESE WILL BE FIXED AS THE GAME CONTINUES TO BE DEVELOPED.This is defienitly one of my favorite games and you should 100% buy it if you like base building and unit control. Seriously, buy this game. It's not perfect (yet) but it's just plain fun (I can imagine even more so with friends but I wouldn't know). Just buy the game."

My only real other complaints are units take a couple clicks for it to register and theres no shift click multi tasking feature, also hate how you can rush your enemies gates with units and if they arent quick enough to close high chance easy acess through gate. Be warned tho, this game is false advertising at the point it is now. On campaign you get a preset army that you can buy from towns the bigger the town the bigger the army you can buy. All the troops get reset after every battle so you could lose all the units you start with and youll still get them all back after. Campaign is nothing but a glorified skirmish map with each town acting as a diff map. It is early acess and i do not judge it harshly because it looks very promising just warning you is all."

It's really confusing also to figure out how use the UI. I ran through the tutorial, but it was lore-text-heavy and didn't really seem to teach much.

So naturaly I had to give it a try.Unfortunately it is an RTS city builder/war strategy game that gets nothing right.Not sure why all the positive reviews. Its a unique twist, yes. But its the worst in both genres.The combat, the building, the politics, and any other mechanic the game decides to throw at you is just too shallow and not managed well at all. People are just hyping that it decided to include city building into a RTS map (both of which are poorly done).Knights Honor made like 20 years ago is a better fit.I am going to hold onto the game in hopes the devs start improving the depth of this game. Luckily it was cheap, So I dont feel ripped off.*****I gave it another shot 2 months after my review (now October), which had 2 HUGE updates released. Lots of improvements but again...there is nothing I enjoyed about this game.

,Not Recommended,499660,34316197,Posted: 17 August,all,Azazil,"I purchased this game based off of all the positive reviews and found myself bewildered.Lets start of with the one positive I really found was that its a very beautiful looking game.The maps, towns and units all look nice. Other than that I found medieval kingdom wars tobe very dull. The combat right now feels very simple and mind numbingly boring.I foundmyself not wanting to attack towns based off the fact I had to keep building my camps upfrom scratch. I kept thinking that this game felt almost like an IOS game where each timeI attacked a town I would have to sit there for 45 mins building and gathering resources.With no threat of intellectual attack from the enemy. Once I had a good enough army Iwould attack aweful ai units that I could just sit back with my longbows and murder, Or Icould attack with a strong inf who attack one unit and then sit there until i gave them anorder to attack another unit. Meanwhile enemy bows are just peltering them till I realisetheir not attacking another unit. It felt super micromanaging.Ontop of that instead of having an army with set units that you start to care about, eachtime you attack or are attacked youre given a set of basic troops based off your army level(purchased with gold). As for building up your camps and towns, it wasnt really customizable.Your walls and buildings can only be built on preset spots so basically you dont have to putmuch thought into your towns and inevitably just giving you no reason to care about them.The tech tree is sort of intricate but then again the categories are kind of stupid and dontmake much sense. I get this game is in early realease and hopefully theyll work out all of thekinks and make it more enjoyable. From a person who loves slow games like Civ 5,Hearts ofIron, Europa Universalis and total war series, I currently do not recommend this game unlessyoure really into IOS games lol"

,Recommended,499660,32305926,Posted: 9 June,all,Count of War,"The biggest sad thing about this game is that is has SOOO much promise and SOOO much potential to be amazing... but it has simplistic approaches to things like politics and initiating sieges and battles, as proven by the company's previous games, they use most if not all of the same animations from their past games and haven't seemed to improve the graphics much, probably for a good reason as a game with this much intensity can get so laggy...But total war did it? Gave us still great graphics and large scale sieges and warfare... why not this developer... that's where i get a little disappointed with them, however i'm willing to see this out, it's still a fun game and i have trust they will work hard on the diplomacy and work on how the campaign map functions, So I would recommend this game for the fact that the developer seems fully dedicated to it!I honestly believe the price fits the detail of the game though, around $20 USD without the -10% off? Thats awesome and for the size of the game it seems amazingly cheap! If they keep up the work on the campaign map, which the game should revolve around, and the promises they have made otherwise this game is well on its way to being FAR more worth $20 USD (without the -10% off).However their refusal to upgrade their textures, animations and other graphics to make them different and better than their predecessor games is quite disheartening in my personal opinion. However I do hope the developers learn from this game and in the future work to overhaul their future games and charge us full price, hell I would pay the money for those major improvements!So I DO highly recommend any strategy gamer to get this game, it's well on its way to exceed its price tag, as of now it's rough around the edges, which is to be expected, theres no diplomacy, theres no city editing yet, you can view the city itself and check it out, which is AMAZING. They lack variety in cities right now but do NOT give up on this game!"

Catapults, these are the bases of which I layed my first seige with and to be honest against AI they are an army by themselves, their rate of fire is quick and their range large, making them attack a ground target of my choice even in the darkness I saw them defeat the enemy defenders with no retaliation meaning a lengthy war became 20 mins of letting 3 catapults consently fire, the two ways I see to fix this is shorten their range bring them close to arrow fire, second rate of fire could be decresed, I also used a trebuchet however I feel these like buildings should be on their own plot built for a fixed position to get through the first wall as their range could make the game feel rushed to the end something Total War did quite often.2. Starting the campaign, I chose my kingdom of austria given an army at the start I looked around and found my units, it gave their name and a (3) I don't know if this means their power is 3 or their starting men are the strength of 3 in terms of power ranking, i've seen it go down as I fight other armies but as a human I can produce troops to match the enemies meaning power of the engaging army only means something if you auto reslove everything, if this is what your planning then I understand as this follows Total War in that the computer might not win but a human could, the other problem was that picking Austria I believed that I was getting a kingdom instead I got a small hamlet and the only distinction was a small difference in flag something I noticed but a novice RTS player might not as might, mine was blue and the enemies was a red X for the flag symbol, I believe a simple line of text telling the player ""This is your base and you must conquer outwards but first build it up"", would be a great help.3. Seige AI attackers plus defenders, I noticed in both occasions playing on both medium and hard difficulty that the AI in defence of their city do not defend the walls instead have to be coxed into moving them, the same with the attackers as they hobble around their manor and respective troop producers e.g. archer barracks and soldier barracks, this issue might be fixed in the future but the game shows potential in that even slow AI in defence hold a good number of defenders meaning even a vetern player can have a tough time getting through unless they abuse the catapult system i've stated before.SummaryAll in all this is still an Alpha it is a good game which shows promise it feels to be a bit like Warcraft 3 in that actions have consequces and that im building units that wouldn't have to wait a turn to move, I love Total War games and turn base is heavily used due to the large scale maps and units they use but this can become tedious due to the waiting of all other AI to make choices, I felt the need to add my say as this game feels as though its being thought out and produced to the best of the gamer makers abilities, it wouldn't be a triple A game it dosent have to be but I believe but it has character and freedom of choice, something if kept and worked on will make it something of a cult classic of sorts."

As such, I have to say I would have love to have try this game but due to a fatal mistake of selecting French, thinking that is who I will be playing and not the language I wish to read dialogue, I was forced to shelf this game, asking for a refund. I even tried resetting this feature by uninstalling and reinstalling the game but still found I was stuck to reading French. I can not rate this game beyond that point but based on encountering a fatal flaw at the start of the game, I can not forsee investing time in this game and would not recommend it to other based on my initial encounter. If you did not make the same mistake I made, I hope you enjoy the game."

Medieval Kingdoms has a few bugs and a few  strange settings that leave me confused and maybe others.Things I would like the deveolpers to consider changing.1- As king I should have the ability to upgrade ANY wall no matter the town or city level.2- being able to fling dead cows into a enemy town or city.3- Adding REFRESH  when hosting a game.4- When attacking a town on easy/easy gemmie some action instead of falling asleep.5- Removing the two or more of those red stripped tents to build palisades.. make the KEEP should have that ability to build the palisades around the town or city.6- No idea how to use the steward and the tech...do you ask for the tech upgrade before the war after the war during the war or is it a player level.....not enough information given for some interactions and commands.7- More interaction with your marshal   ON EASY/MEDIUM OR HARD levels.8- The chance to place gates anywhere after the palisade is complate.9 - When the gate is locked your serfs will walk through the gate to chop wood allowing the enemy to enter.10- Large battles drop the frame rate to a crawl even on high end PC'sBeside those ten idea's  I'm enjoying Medieval Kingdom War alot. And I highly recommend this game and price for the game in hours of  Medieval Kingdom War.
